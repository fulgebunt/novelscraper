He felt pain in every inch of his body, and the stench of burnt flesh drifted past his nose. Wait a sec! What\u2019s going on?Zu An clearly remembered that just a few seconds ago, he was engaging in an argument with a bunch of people on an internet forum. Even though it was raining and thundering outside his room, none of that had interfered with his furious typing skills one whit. He had been trolling the absolute shit out of all those people, insulting them to the point of speechlessness\u2026 ahem, which is to say, he was persuading them through appeals to their sense of decency.And then, there had been a huge explosion of lighting and thunder. A basketball-sized clump of lightning had suddenly drifted inside his window. He remembered how it had glowed in midair, emanating that strange, hazy red light.And then? Zu An remembered hearing an absolute miserable scream ringing out, followed by a sensation that was absolutely indescribable. He vaguely recalled seeing the keyboard in front of him vaporize into dust, followed by his hands (which had been placed on the keyboard) vanishing as well. More and more of him had been vaporized, until finally\u2026 everything became a blank.Was I just hit by lightning? What the hell was that thing? Ball lightning? As a highly qualified keyboard warrior, he had naturally read up on these phenomena before. He was a naturally quick-witted, and instead of feeling frightened he instead felt a sense of excitement and eagerness. Holy shit! Have I gained superpowers? Maybe I\u2019m going to turn into the Flash! Or maybe even Captain Atom?He struggled to open his eyes, but everything in front of him was a blur. He couldn\u2019t tell where he was at all. Suddenly, a stabbing pain radiated into him from his fingertips. He hurriedly turned to look downwards\u2026 and at this time, he suddenly saw something before him.He wasn\u2019t sure if he was \u2018seeing\u2019 with his eyes or with his mind, but in front of his fingers was a floating keyboard. It looked identical to the keyboard he normally used, with the only difference being that all the keys looked incredibly gray and lifeless. He reached out with a finger to test the keys out, but none of the keys would budge at all. It was as though all of them were completely locked in place.\u201cYou have successfully bound the \u2018Keyboard Warrior\u2019 account. Upon fulfilling the necessary conditions, the relevant abilities shall be unlocked.\u201d An icy voice suddenly reverberated in Zu An\u2019s mind, scaring the crap out of him.What the hell? Zu An thought to himself. Why can\u2019t I be the Flash, Spiderman, Iron Man, or something cool like that? Although the \u2018Keyboard Warrior\u2019 title kinda fits my personality, it feels\u2026 weird.\u201cSo what do I need to do to unlock these abilities?\u201d Zu An hurriedly asked.\u201cCollect the secret manuals from this world\u2019s Twelve Unknowable Regions and then embed them into the F1 through F12 function keys. Each time you collect a manual, you\u2019ll unlock a corresponding ability,\u201d the icy voice replied.Only then did Zu An notice that the various function keys on his keyboard were covered with some strange runes. Apparently, these were meant to correspond to those twelve so-called secret manuals.\u201cGood luck, Keyboard Warrior!\u201d After these final words, the keyboard suddenly began to fold in on itself until it transformed into a shadow that then shot into his fingertip.Zu An hurriedly said, \u201cWait a second! What the hell are the \u2018Twelve Unknowable Regions\u2019, and how am I supposed to find these secret manuals?\u201d But no matter how he shouted, the icy voice no longer responded to him. By now, that mysterious keyboard had completely vanished as well.Zu An wanted to cuss. This is bullshit. A keyboard? All the people in the stories get to start with something cool, like the Midas touch and stuff. Why do I have to start with everything locked and work my way until it\u2019s all unlocked? And just from the sound of it, the \u2018Twelve Unknowable Regions\u2019 sound incredibly dangerous, and I doubt they\u2019ll just hand out secret manuals freely. And I need to get twelve of them?! This is fucking bullshit!The hazy area around him slowly began to vanish as well. He could feel sunlight returning to the world, and could even vaguely make out the sounds of others speaking nearby.\u201cNow that was odd. There\u2019s not a cloud in the sky. Where did the lightning come from? It makes no sense.\u201d\u201cThis guy\u2019s probably done so many bad things that the heavens themselves have finally gotten sick of him.\u201d\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that the useless son-in-law of the Chu clan? He should have thanked his lucky stars that a fairy maiden like First Miss Chu would fall for him, but was he? No! I heard that last night, his wedding night, he actually snuck into his sister-in-law\u2019s bed!\u201d\u201cHoly hell! He\u2019s planning on bagging both of them?\u201d\u201cEhehehe. Plenty of guys like to eye their sister-in-law\u2019s, after all.\u201d\u201cNo wonder he got hit by lightning! Serves him right!\u201d\u201cPity about that lovely First Miss Chu, though. So young, but already a widow.\u201d\u201cShh! The Chu clan might hear you gossiping. They are searching everywhere for this animal.\u201dZu An was completely confused by what he was hearing. What is this nonsense? And what the hell is going on in the world? Everyone\u2019s just watching, but no one\u2019s even called for an ambulance. When I get better, I\u2019m going to expose all of them and their shameless actions on social media!\u201cOut of the way! The coroner\u2019s arrived,\u201d someone shouted out.Coroner?! Zu An was stunned. Shouldn\u2019t they call a doctor? Are they shooting a historical drama here?Moments later, he felt someone crouch down by his side, then begin poking and prodding at him. A voice then said, \u201cThe corpse\u2019s head is sallow, while his body is charred black. His hands are balled loosely, while his mouth is wide and his eyes are open. His body is covered with red and purple streaks, but his flesh seems unharmed. He has indeed died as a result of a lightning strike.\u201dZu An was both nervous and angry upon hearing this. Dying was one thing, but dying in such an ugly fashion was simply unforgivable. He somehow mustered up the strength sit up and bellow, \u201cHEY! Can you put some makeup on me first before you all start taking pictures?\u201d\u201cZOMBIE!!!\u201d All the people surrounding him suddenly screamed in unison.Zu An was stunned. Everyone around him was indeed dressed in ancient period costumes, and the quality seemed quite low. It was unlike the beautiful, gaudy costumes he saw on TV. Even more nerve-wracking was the fact that he didn\u2019t see any cameras or cameramen nearby. In fact, he couldn\u2019t see so much as a cell phone anywhere! Nor did he see any telephone lines, cars, or any other traces of the world he lived in.So I didn\u2019t die? Have I transmigrated into another world? He was a huge fan of webnovels and had read about quite a lot of situations like this, so he actually wasn\u2019t too shocked.\u201cW-w-what the hell type of freak are you?!\u201d The corner was so shocked that he had fallen flat onto his back. Lips quavering, he pointed at Zu An as he spoke.\u201cI\u2019m not a freak, jackass. Can\u2019t you even tell the difference between a person and a corpse? I think you need to find a new day job.\u201d Cough, cough. Smoke continually emitted from his mouth and nostrils as he spoke, and it began to cause him to choke on his words. Most likely, this was an after-effect of being hit by lightning.Only then did Zu An notice that his own clothes were different from his normal apparel as well, and even his arms and legs were considerably slimmer than his own. Suddenly, a terrifying thought entered his mind. He hurriedly pulled open his pants and glanced downwards\u2026 then immediately let out a heart-wrenching shriek of agony.\u201cAww, FUUUUUCK!\u201dWhere there originally should\u2019ve been a \u2018giant roc\u2019, he now saw a \u2018tiny chick\u2019. No man could withstand the mental shock of it all.Suddenly, the entire area fell silent. The surrounding people hurriedly stepped aside, parting to reveal an opening as they looked off into the distance. Some people nervously lowered their heads, but secretly snuck glances at the new arrivals.Zu An unconsciously turned to look as well. Finally, he understood why everyone had reacted this way.A woman dressed in white was slowly walking towards him.Her eyes were clear, and her skin was snowy-white. Her eyebrows were so beautiful as to look painted-on, and a clear breeze seemed to accompany her every step. Her beautiful black hair fluttered in the wind, and her white dress rustled as well. Her slender, willowy waist was surrounded by a pale blue belt. It all came together to make her look like an ephemeral fairy maiden amidst the clouds.HOLY SHIT! At this moment, he blamed and hated his own lack of education for rendering him unable to use the proper language to describe such beauty.He noticed that she was gazing down at him. Somehow, he feebly crawled to his feet. \u201cHey, hottie. Do you have a boyfriend? If you do, would you consider swapping him out? Or perhaps adding a second one would be better?\u201dA hint of a displeased look flashed past the white-robed woman\u2019s face. She said coldly, \u201cNice, Zu An. It\u2019s only been a few hours since our wedding, but you no longer recognize me?Wu-wu-wuuuh?! Zu An was instantly stunned. So the woman walking towards him, so beautiful she seemed to have stepped out of a portrait, was actually this poor bastard\u2019s wife? Even more shockingly, this poor bastard who had been killed by lightning was also named Zu An?Right at this moment, a large amount of both foreign-feeling and familiar-feeling information suddenly flooded his mind.It felt familiar because this world was very similar to that of ancient China, and they shared a similar language and culture. It felt foreign because this was a world of cultivation, a world where people could reach incredible heights of strength, becoming so mighty as to cleave entire seas with their sword or leap past the horizon with a single bound.It wasn\u2019t exactly the same as the world of the Xianxia cultivation novels he had read. In this world, most of the power was concentrated in the hands of the imperial temple. The more powerful you became, the more power and authority you would receive as well.This land was known as that of the Zhou Dynasty, and its current emperor was one of the most powerful cultivators in the land.The Zhou Dynasty was an incomparably flourishing one, and it had lasted far longer than any of ancient China\u2019s dynasties. The princes and kings of the Dynasty were scattered throughout the lands, and below them were the dukes, the marquises, the counts, the viscounts, and the barons. These nobles all had their own fiefdoms and private armies, and they jointly supervised their assigned territory alongside officials appointed by the imperial court.The city they were currently in, Brightmoon City, was the fiefdom of the Brightmoon Duke, also known as Chu Zhongtian.His body\u2019s previous owner was also named Zu An. He had been an orphan who an uncle had raised, and was rather well-known in the city as a young ne\u2019er-do-well. He had been untalented in both learning and cultivation, but had incredibly lofty dreams that vastly surpassed his reach. Supposedly, this fatal combination had enraged his uncle so much that the old man had died of anger.But not too long ago, something happened which shocked everywhere. This wastrel had somehow gained the attention of the \u2018princess\u2019 of Brightmoon City, which was to say the eldest daughter of the Brightmoon Duke. He had been summoned to the Chu Estate and had become the duke\u2019s son-in-law.How could such a useless person be worthy of the noble First Miss Chu, especially considering how surpassingly beautiful she was? Virtually everyone who heard this news thought the same thing: Even I would be a better choice than him!As for this beautiful white-dressed woman before him? This was the First Miss of the Chu clan, Chu Chuyan.Thankfully, Zu An managed to think on his feet when faced with her reproving question. Smiling, he reached out to hug her by the waist. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be heart-broken to see me like this, so I thought I\u2019d tell a little joke and break up the tension.\u201dSince he had apparently been transmigrated into another Zu An in a parallel dimension, then that meant this lady was now his wife! But of course, if she was hideously ugly there was no way he would\u2019ve been so eager to accept her.Chu Chuyan smoothly turned and stepped aside, avoiding his grasping paws. \u201cHeart-broken? Over you?\u201d Her calm voice held a hint of coldness within it.Zu An didn\u2019t mind, as he simply assumed she was too shy to behave intimately with him in public. He hurriedly chased after her, wanting to take this opportunity to increase her positive impressions of him.Unexpectedly, a figure suddenly leapt out and barred his path. Zu An blinked. A young woman dressed in green robes had reached out to bar his path. She had flat bangs, an exquisite coifed ponytail, and was also quite willowy. In fact, her waist was so fiendishly slender that it was without a doubt the most alluring part of her.Just as Zu An was about to blurt out a few words of appreciation for her attractiveness, she said something which was quite unpleasant to hear. \u201cHave you forgotten your place? You know the rules, get back in line.\u201dZu An blinked as he scanned his memories. Ah, right. This young woman was Miss Chu\u2019s personal maidservant, Snow. How dare a serving wench like you speak to her master like this?Right at this moment, he heard some whispers coming from the bystanders.\u201cSo that\u2019s the eldest daughter of the Chu clan? She really is unspeakably beautiful.\u201d\u201cEven her maid is gorgeous!\u201d\u201cSo that guy who was hit by lightning really is the cowardly son-in-law of the Chu clan? How the hell did he pull this off?\u201d\u201cEveryone in the city knows that he\u2019s just mooching off his wife at the Chu clan. Look, even the maid despises him!\u201d?!?! Cowardly son-in-law?! An odd look was on Zu An\u2019s face. It looked like his previous self wasn\u2019t doing very well in this world. Still, he didn\u2019t mind too much. So what if I\u2019m a lady-moocher? Mooching requires talent as well! All of you guys want to mooch like me, you just don\u2019t have the skills to do so!Chu Chuyan quickly boarded a carriage. Zu An wanted to follow her inside, but the maidservant Snow gave him a glower from her position in front of the carriage as she denied him entrance. The other servants seemed to be accustomed to this, and they immediately began to drive the carriage forward while completely ignoring his presence.Zu An was starting to feel a little pissed. Look, lady, your husband just got hit by lightning. I\u2019m feeling pretty weak right now. At the very least, you shouldn\u2019t be forcing me to walk back, right? And so, casting caution to the wind, he immediately ran forwards and then moved to seat himself atop Snow\u2019s lap.Shocked, Snow hurriedly moved to one side. This created an opening, and Zu An immediately scurried into the carriage itself.The carriage was filled with a faint yet mesmerizing scent. Chu Chuyan was currently reading a book, and she was clearly startled to see him suddenly barge inside. In the past, he had always obediently stayed outside! For a moment, she just stared at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do.Just as Zu An was about to speak, he suddenly noticed the name of the book she was holding: [Sweet Pampered Wife: Dominating Sword Immortal\u2019s Ninety-Nine Days of Searching For Love]. He blinked.A heartbeat later Snow furiously charged inside after him. \u201cUgh, I swear, you\u2026\u201dChu Chuyan hurriedly hid the book inside her sleeves, a tinge of pink suffusing her flawless face. \u201cForget it, Snow. Just let him stay inside.\u201dSnow glared at Zu An, then angrily returned to sit outside in front of the of the carriage.\u201cDid you\u2026 see something just now?\u201d A dangerous light flashed through Chu Chuyan\u2019s eyes.Zu An hurriedly shook his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a thing!\u201d So this world has pulpy romance fiction? And the names are just as shameless as the sappy romance novels back on Earth. He really didn\u2019t expect that such an icy beauty would also be secretly reading these types of novels.He could tell, however, that she didn\u2019t believe him. Frightened that she might kill him to cover up her secret, Zu An hurriedly changed the subject. \u201cSweetheart, have you heard of an \u2018Unknowable Region\u2019? Which one is closest to our home?\u201dA look of shock appeared on Chu Chuyan\u2019s face. \u201cWhere did you learn of this phrase, \u2018Unknowable Region\u2019?\u201d Outside the carriage, a crafty look flashed through Snow\u2019s eyes as well, but she hurriedly lowered her head to disguise it.Zu An replied almost unconsciously, \u201cI heard someone mention them.\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d Chu Chuyan frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that an ordinary person would\u2019ve even heard of this phrase.\u201d1. LOL. This sounds very much like a Xianxia version of the female romance webnovels girls like to read these days\u2026Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUpon seeing the confused look on Zu An\u2019s face, Chu Chuyan said slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t care where you heard this phrase from. In the future, do not ask any questions regarding it. Otherwise, you\u2019ll get yourself killed.\u201dZu An was secretly speechless. Oh, sweet lord. Looks like these Unknowable Regions are gonna be trouble. Suddenly, he paused. That means this goddamn keyboard is trolling me! If even asking about it is going to get me killed, how am I supposed to get some \u2018secret manuals\u2019 from these places to unlock the various functions?He took a deep breath. Ah, forget it. Even if I don\u2019t get a special ability from the start, so what? To start this transmigration with such a hot wife is a stroke of decent luck. I\u2019ll work everything else out.As for the obvious difference in status between his wife and himself, he wasn\u2019t too worried. He had read many webnovels in the past with similar situations, and he would use the techniques he read from some of the best male leads in similar situations, like Xiang Shaolong , Wei Xiaobao , or Song Qingshu . Even if you are a glacier, I\u2019m sure I can melt you.Just imaging how, the previous night, he had shared a bed with this fairy-like beauty was enough to get his heart pumping. Whoah, boy. Calm down, and wipe that drool. Keep it cool.Zu An didn\u2019t continue this line of questioning, as he didn\u2019t want to arouse any suspicions. His wife clearly had no interest in conversing further with him, and so he glanced out the window to look at their surroundings.A short while later, he could see city walls appearing in the difference. Judging from their size, if this city was transported to ancient China it would\u2019ve still been a large one.As they entered through the city gates, he noticed that above the gates were written three giant characters \u2013 BRIGHT MOON CITY. He mused to himself, I should find a chance to buy a map and see where this city is located in the empire. The original owner of this body was so useless that he lacked even this sort of rudimentary knowledge.He continued to sneak glances at the streets of the city. Although they couldn\u2019t compare to modern city downtowns, the streets were still quite bustling, filled with people and tradesmen. What surprised him the most, however, was that the carriage didn\u2019t jolt from bumps at all. It continued to move through the streets as smoothly as though he was riding in the finest of cars back home.Suddenly, he noticed that some faint blue lines were flowing through the insides of the carriage. It almost looked like a series of electric circuits. Is this one of the legendary \u2018formations\u2019? They\u2019re using a formation on a carriage? That\u2019s pretty extravagant.Time passed. They finally arrived at a large estate, with two giant stone sculptures situated right in front of it. He wasn\u2019t sure what creatures these sculptures depicted; they looked like a mixture of tigers and lions, and emanated a strange aura of power.The carriage came to a halt. The white-dressed Chu Chuyan stepped out of the carriage, lotus petals blooming beneath her with each step, then walked straight through the gates.Zu An snuck a glance at his surroundings. He saw a placard with the words \u2018CHU ESTATE\u2019 located above the gates. He secretly muttered to himself. Eeesh! Does this guy\u2019s life suck so much that he lives with his wife\u2019s family? So he married into her family, rather than the reverse? No wonder every makes fun of him!He began to stride forwards, only to be blocked by Snow once more. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about entering through the main gates. Off to the side gates with you!\u201dZu An blinked. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go through the main gates?\u201dSnow pursed his lips. \u201cThe main gates are for the Chu clansmen to pass through. How could a drafted son-in-law like you qualify? You\u2019d sully the clan gates.\u201dZu An calmly stared at her. \u201cYou got a pretty nasty mouth on you. I bet your boyfriend has a bad case of herpes.\u201dAlthough Snow didn\u2019t really know what this meant, she was sure it was an insult. Furious, she grabbed him by the shirt and moved as though she was going to strike him. Unexpectedly, before her fist had actually connected, Zu An immediately fell to the ground by her feet and started to scream \u2018in pain\u2019.I\u2026 didn\u2019t even hit him yet? A stupefied look was on Snow\u2019s face. Clearly, \u2018flopping\u2019 wasn\u2019t a thing in this world.Chu Chuyan turned to look at them. \u201cYou are being too impudent. No matter what, he\u2019s the Chu clan\u2019s son-in-law. In the future, you are not to treat him this way.\u201dA wronged look was on Snow\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t dare argue. \u201cUnderstood.\u201dChu Chuyan glanced at Zu An. \u201cCan you get up now?\u201dZu An quickly clambered to his feet, then said with a cheeky grin, \u201cI knew you cared about me.\u201dChu Chuyan frowned, subconsciously taking a step back and putting some more distance between them. She then turned and began to walk inside. Her voice floated back: \u201cFather and Mother are waiting inside. Stop wasting time.\u201d\u201cJust think about what you did last night! Now, you are pretending that nothing happened? Shameless! I\u2019m eager to see what the old master and the old mistress are gonna do to you!\u201d Snow gave him a nasty glance, then quickly trotted in to follow her young mistress.Only then did Zu An recollect the conversation he had overheard earlier. Apparently, the previous Zu An had clambered into his sister-in-law\u2019s bed last night? Oh, god. Apparently I\u2019m starting this game on Hell difficulty!His eyes spun about in thought, then he suddenly grabbed his head while calling out, \u201cMy head hurts!\u201d At the same time, he \u2018fell\u2019 towards the two women\u2026 but both stepped to the side, letting him crash to the ground.This time, Zu An really was in so much pain that he was about to cry, but he didn\u2019t dare make a sound. Clearly, using the same trick twice wasn\u2019t going to work. The people here clearly aren\u2019t honest and guileless. They catch on immediately!\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you catch him?\u201d Chu Chuyan glanced at Snow in irritation.Snow\u2019s little mouth twitched. \u201cYou didn\u2019t catch him either, young mistress. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s faking it.\u201dChu Chuyan gave the fallen Zu An a glance, then said, \u201cI heard he was hit by lightning today. Perhaps he really is injured. Take him back and let him get some rest. Give him a bath as well. I\u2019ll let my parents know.\u201d After speaking, she walked away gracefully.There was nothing Snow could do but arrange for two manservants to bring over a litter and carry Zu An over to one side.On the litter, Zu An was feeling rather puzzled. He had apparently clambered into his sister-in-law\u2019s bed the night of the wedding, but Chu Chuyan didn\u2019t reprove him for it at all. In fact, she didn\u2019t even look angry. Is her little sister adopted? He mused, his thoughts rather impure.They entered a doorway, moved through a long pathway, past a rock garden, then arrived by the side of a pavilion. It was an incredibly winding route they took, and upon reaching the pavilion Snow suddenly said, \u201cPut him here for now. Let\u2019s go get a few buckets of water so he can bathe himself.\u201dZu An stealthily opened his eyes after hearing the footsteps move away. He had been placed within a gazebo next to a small pond. Seeing that nobody was nearby, he clambered to his feet. He glanced down into the water, only to see that his hair was completely tousled and his face was scorched black. No wonder my freebie wife had that look of disgust on her face when she saw me!Suddenly, he felt surge of power push against him from behind, sending him flying straight into the pool.\u201cHeeeelp! HEEELP!\u201dActually, he had swam in rivers ever since he was young, so there was no way he could possibly drown in a small pond like this. However, he was fairly certain that just now someone had kicked him into the water. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, so he put on a pretense of being unable to swim.He could vaguely make out a willowy form standing by the side of the water, smiling coldly at him. Zu An was shocked. Why does Snow want to kill me? Is this some sort of scheme that my freebie wife concocted with an illicit lover? Or is it the Chu clan which has felt ashamed by what happened and has decided to use an \u2018accident\u2019 to dispose of this son-in-law of theirs?Multiple possibilities flitted through his head. Moments later, he pretended to have drowned to death and let his body simply float at the top of the water.\u201cHe\u2019s dead already? He got off easy,\u201d the nearby Snow chirped in surprise. She then tossed out a ribbon from within her sleeves and hooked it around the \u2018corpse\u2019 floating in the pond.Zu An was startled. So this little wench knows martial arts? It seemed as though he would have to be even more cautious of her.Snow squatted down by the water, then reached out towards his neck test his pulse. Right at this moment, the \u2018dead\u2019 Zu An suddenly opened his eyes and blasted a mouthful of water into Snow\u2019s face. As Snow instinctively closed her eyes, he immediately pulled her into his arms and then dragged her back into the water with him.Snow knew that she had just fallen for a trap. She subconsciously began to circulate her internal energy to beat him up, but as soon as she opened her mouth she suddenly swallowed a large mouthful of water.Garg. Garg. Although she knew martial arts, this was an era in which almost no women knew how to swim. In the span of just a few seconds, she had already choked down quite a few mouthfuls of water. She struggled to pull herself back towards the edge of the pond, but there was nothing she could reach.Panicked, she suddenly twitched her hand and sent out another white ribbon. This one latched around a pole near the water\u2019s edge. Just as she was about to use it to pull herself back onto land, Zu An latched onto her with both his arms and his legs, clutching at her like an octopus and making it impossible for her to exert any strength.Snow was both humiliated and enraged by Zu An pressing himself so tightly against her body. She frantically tried to struggle, but Zu An\u2019s swimming abilities were just too much. With her in his clutches, he sank deeper and deeper into the water. After choking on multiple mouthfuls of water, her vision slowly began to grow hazy.Zu An could sense that her struggling movements were was beginning to fade away. Guess that\u2019s about it. He finally pulled her out from the water.Her eyes were shut, while here eyelids were quivering. She really did have an elegant nose, and also had a pair of cherry-red lips. She clearly looked like a delicate beauty\u2026 but her words were vicious, and her heart was rather viperish. It\u2019d be wonderful if she was a mute.\u201cSo. What should I do now?\u201d Zu An mused to himself, quickly running through the possibilities. Someone in this estate wanted to kill him. Staying here was too dangerous. But, if he was to run away\u2026 even if he somehow made it through the great gates of the estate, he would be completely penniless and also lack knowledge regarding this world. He\u2019d probably starve to death in days.Considering the shameful acts \u2018he\u2019 had just carried out yesterday, if he actually killed someone today? The government would definitely pursue him as a criminal.Wait a sec. Since someone was trying to make his death look like an accident, that meant they were afraid to openly kill him. Fine. I\u2019ll take this gamble.He lowered his head, pressing his ear against Snow\u2019s chest. There\u2019s no heartbeat! He couldn\u2019t help but feel shocked, and immediately decided to use CPR chest compressions to try and bring her back to life.As he loosened her robes, a large amount of candied fruits and nuts and other snacks fell out. He was stupefied upon seeing this. \u201cShe eats a lot. How the hell is she so skinny?\u201d But it was no time for pondering this question. He placed both his hands against her chest and began to use CPR.Even after twenty chest compressions, she still didn\u2019t respond in the slightest. Just as he was about to start trying out mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, he suddenly heard an icy voice from behind: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dZu An looked back, only to see the frosty-faced Chu Chuyan standing nearby. He subconsciously looked down at Snow. Her hair was tousled, her dress was open, her undergarments and her pale skin could vaguely be seen\u2026 and his hands were pressed upon her chest.\u201cUh\u2026 would you believe me if I said I was trying to rescue her?\u201d Zu An said seriously. At the same time, he subconsciously gave another press to her chest.Chu Chuyan walked over, a calm look on her face. \u201cMove aside.\u201d She gauged Snow\u2019s condition for a moment, then quickly began to tap various points on her body, her fingers moving like a blur.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but rub his eyes. Sweet mother of god. So my freebie wife is also a kungfu master?! But it made sense, given that even a maid like Snow knew martial arts. So. Is my freebie wife the one who wants me dead?\u201cWifey dearest, how good is your kungfu?\u201d Zu An asked in a probing manner.Blargh. Right at this moment, Snow began to cough out multiple mouthfuls of water. Clearly, she had been saved. Chu Chuyan gently patted her on the back while turning her head to stare at Zu An. \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d\u201cUh, sweetheart?\u201d Zu An mentally shuddered and hurriedly changed the way he addressed her.Chu Chuyan\u2019s gaze turned even colder. She said in a flat voice, \u201cAs I told you before we became married, in the future you may address me as Miss Chu or as Chuyan. You are not to refer to me using those two words in the future.\u201d\u201cGot it, sweetheart!\u201d Zu An immediately assented. \u201cSo, how strong is your kungfu? What\u2019s your world ranking?\u201d\u201cKungfu? You must mean cultivation.\u201d Chu Chuyan frowned slightly, but she still answered the question. \u201cThe world is a vast place. No matter how strong you are, there is always someone stronger; there is always a heaven beyond the heavens. How could I possibly know what my \u2018ranking\u2019 is?\u201dZu An mumbled, \u201cGuess that means you suck.\u201dChu Chuyan took a deep breath, but before she had a chance to reply, Zu An immediately continued: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though! We\u2019re family now, so I won\u2019t look down at you. How about this? Why don\u2019t you teach me some martial arts. Do you know any mysterious techniques that could allow someone to accomplish in one year what takes normal people ten? Or maybe an ultimate attack that can be quickly mastered.\u201d That\u2019s how these stories are supposed to go, right?It was clear that someone in the estate wanted to kill him. It made him sense danger everywhere. If he learned some martial arts, it would also be easier for him to explore the Unknowable Regions in the future.\u201cThere are no such techniques,\u201d Chu Chuyan said coldly. \u201cAnd even if there were, you wouldn\u2019t be able to master them.\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d Zu An immediately leapt to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m a one-in-a-million talent. How could someone like me be unable to master your techniques? I bet you just don\u2019t want to teach me.\u201dChu Chuyan replied, \u201cAll cultivators in the world begin tempering their body from a young age. This process requires a large amount of elementum. After becoming an adult, your body will have already reached maturity and there\u2019s no point wasting resources on it. In addition, your talent is just barely a lower Ding, a lower fourth-class. Even if you did train from youth, there\u2019s no hope.\u201d She slightly shook her head.What the hell is a lower Ding? He could immediately tell that it wasn\u2019t a good evaluation, but Zu An didn\u2019t really mind. All the MC\u2019s in cultivation stories start off at the trash level, right? They just need to find suitable training techniques. For that matter, this was a good sign; by starting off as trash tier, from a certain perspective it meant he had already fulfilled half of the prerequisites for becoming the main character.Snow was beginning to wake up, and so Chu Chuyan no longer paid Zu An any heed. \u201cSnow, what happened just now?\u201d1. The protagonist in Huang Yi\u2019s wuxia novel \u2018A Step Into the Past\u2019.2. The protagonist in Jinyong\u2019s wuxia novel \u2018Duke of Mount Deer\u2019.3. A figure in Jinyong\u2019s wuxia novel \u2018Heaven Sword, Dragon Saber\u2019.4. This is a very Chinese concept. Traditionally, when a man marries a wife, he \u2018takes\u2019 her from her maiden home and makes her a member of his own clan. For the reverse to happen is generally considered incredibly shameful and reflective of a vast social gap between the two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust as Snow was about to speak, Zu An let out a rapid-fire series of responses. \u201cJust now, I tripped and fell into the pool. Our little sister Snow wanted to save me, but she accidentally slipped and fell in as well. Thankfully, I know a bit of swimming, and was just barely able to save her.\u201dI have no clue who wants me dead. It\u2019s better to maintain the facade for now, until I figure out what the hell is going on.Snow\u2019s face turned purple for a long moment, but she couldn\u2019t squeeze out a rebuttal.\u201cIs that really what happened?\u201d Chu Chuyan glanced at Snow. \u201cYou are soaking wet. Go back and get a bath and change your clothes, then come eat with us.\u201dAfter saying this, she gracefully drifted off once more. Zu An had to resist the urge to vocalize his inner trolldom. She just floats around in white robes, as though her feet aren\u2019t even touching the ground. If I saw her at night, I\u2019d swear she was a damn ghost.But, a problem quickly came to his mind. \u201cSnow, where do we go for baths and changes of clothes? Shall we go together?\u201d\u201cFuck off!\u201d Snow snapped. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019m indecently attired right now, I swear I\u2019d beat this idiot up so bad that his own mother wouldn\u2019t recognize him. She glanced at her snacks scattered across the ground, a look of sorrow in her eyes. She then stamped her feet and ran off.Fortunately, Chu Chuyan sent a manservant to help guide the way for Zu An. He was brought to a room where he bathed and changed his clothes. Now finally clean, Zu An stared at himself in the mirror. He looked 80% similar to how he did in his past life, with the main difference being that he was now much skinnier. Still, overall he was quite satisfied. \u201cStill a handsome devil. I might not be a match for Pan An, but I\u2019m still a smidgen better than Ximen Qing.\u201dHe had been rather looking forward to sharing a meal with his freebie wife, but in the end she didn\u2019t show up at all. She just had some servants deliver the food to him.\u201cWhat the hell, man. Am I a prisoner or something?\u201d Zu An suddenly realized that the position of a drafted son-in-law was even lower than he had imagined. Judging from what had just happened, he wasn\u2019t even worthy of joining them at the table for meals!\u201cI refuse to eat alms like a beggar!\u201d Zu An had no idea why the previous him was willing to endure such insults. He pushed the dishes to the side in a huff\u2026 but a short while later, his stomach suddenly started to grumble, while the dishes continued to send delicious fragrant scents towards him.Zu An frowned. In the end, he decided that real men knew when to bend the knee and when to stand tall. He pulled all the dishes back, then quickly swept through them like a storm. I gotta say, the chef\u2019s dishes are pretty damn good.After eating, Zu An felt much more comfortable. He began to ponder how he was supposed to survive in this world.He rummaged through the room to find some paper, then wrote at the top: \u2018Tips for Surviving Transmigration\u2019.His mind slowly became filled with all the various bits of information he had seen in the webnovels he had enjoyed in the past\u2026 then begin to fantasy about having a computer\u2026 what it felt like to play mobile games on his iPhone\u2026 the joy of trolling the shit out of people on internet forums\u2026Time passed. Before he knew it, the sky had turned dark. Wait a second. What was I planning to do earlier? He stared at the completely empty draft, his eyelids twitching, then curled it up into a ball and tossed it away. I\u2019ll go outside for a stroll. Let\u2019s see if I can learn anything about this world.Clearly, the previous him had lived a miserable life in this world. I am by nature a kind and helpful person. I need to help the dead guy get his own back and raise his status.Although he wasn\u2019t too familiar with the layout of this area, his gift of the gab allowed him to quickly learn from the servants the location of Chu Chuyan\u2019s residence. Upon arriving outside, he heard Snow\u2019s voice coming from within: \u201cMiss, do you want to eat some sunflower seeds?\u201d\u201cNo need. You shouldn\u2019t eat so many either; I heard that if you eat too many of them, they\u2019ll crack your teeth.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me again, Miss! Which reminds me. That guy\u2019s is behaving increasingly unruly. He used to be fine, but he seemed\u2026 off, today.\u201d\u201cYes, I also had the feeling that something changed today.\u201d Chu Chuyan assented. Just as Zu An was growing a bit nervous, he heard her continue: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he was hit by lightning. It broke his brain, maybe?\u201dZu An was speechless. Snow, however, was rolling with laughter. A long while later, she stopped laughing and let out a snort. \u201cMiss, why haven\u2019t you blamed him for what happened last night?\u201dChu Chuyan said calmly, \u201cThe events of last night were quite bizarre. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll discuss it with Mother and Father before coming to a decision.\u201dZu An was quite delighted upon hearing this. It seems my freebie wife is quite clever. It seems I won\u2019t have to employ too many of those tired old tropes I saw in the tv series.\u201cYou\u2019re letting that guy off too easy,\u201d Snow muttered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the lightning just kill him? That way, Miss, you wouldn\u2019t have to waste your time with that piece of trash.\u201dChu Chuyan rebuked, \u201cDon\u2019t say such things in the future.\u201dFor some reason, perhaps because Chu Chuyan had yet to even mention what had happened by the pool, Zu An started to suspect that perhaps his freebie wife had nothing to do with the scheme against him. Wait. The hotter a woman is, the better she is at lying. I can\u2019t let my guard down.Still, Zu An was starting to grow angry as he continued to hear Snow prattle on and on with insulting words about him. Enough is enough! He kicked the door open.Chu Chuyan was rather startled when she saw him arrive. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dark, and I have nothing that needs doing. I\u2019m going to bed, of course.\u201d Zu An gave Snow a hard glare. I need to find out where they sell some voice-stealing medicines and force-feed them to her. We\u2019ll see how you\u2019ll talk shit about me then!Chu Chuyan\u2019s face sank. \u201cThen why have you come here?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it natural for husband and wife to sleep together?\u201d Zu An replied in a natural manner as he began to walk towards the bedroom.\u201cEEEEEEEP!\u201d A miserable cry could be heard as Zu An was unceremoniously kicked outside the room.Delighting in his misfortune, Snow said, \u201cJackass Zu, why don\u2019t you take a piss on the ground then stare at your own reflection in it? You seem to have forgotten who you are, if you think you can get close to our young mistress!\u201dBut, contrary to her expectations, an amused smile was on Zu An\u2019s face rather than shame or rage.As I expected. Judging from their earlier interactions, Zu An was fairly certain that they had never consummated their marriage. His trip here was just to test this theory out. The confirmation he had just received made him happy, not angry; it meant that he could start from scratch with this freebie wife of his.\u201cDid that bolt of lightning really break your brains?\u201d Snow continued to feel that something was off. He simply wasn\u2019t reacting the way she expected, and this made her mood less good than it should\u2019ve been.Zu An also realized that his reaction seemed a bit off. He hurriedly wiped the smile off his face and put on an aggrieved, heartbroken look. \u201cSuch injustice! I\u2019ve never heard of a wife who refuses to sleep with her husband!\u201d\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Chu Chuyan\u2019s face finally reddened. She waved her sleeves, shutting the door behind him. She wanted to avoid everyone in the area hearing his miserable howls and wails.Zu An continued to shamelessly complain and whine. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to sleep with me, then why did you marry me? Tomorrow, I\u2019m going to run into the streets and stir up a real commotion. I\u2019ll set up a troop of drummers and everything and tell everyone the truth! We\u2019ll see if the Chu clan loses face, or if I do.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d Chu Chuyan rose to her feet, an ineffable aura of power emanating from her.Zu An sniffed. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? My reputation is already thoroughly wrecked anyhow. Besides, this is the end result you want, right? To let all the other rich young masters know that you are pure and unsullied\u2026\u201dChu Chuyan took a deep breath, then stared daggers at Zu An. \u201cSo you really want to sleep with me?\u201d\u201cHell yeah I do!\u201d Zu An said excitedly. What was wrong with this silly girl? Of course I do! He wasn\u2019t going to pass up such a good opportunity. As Eileen Chang once wrote, the best way to a woman\u2019s heart was through her\u2026 ahem. Anyhow, once the rice became cooked, there would be no way to uncook it.Chu Chuyan said calmly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll let Snow accompany you tonight.\u201dSnow had been watching gleefully from the side while eating melon seeds. What the fu.. \u201cBut Miss!\u201d The seeds instantly lost all flavor.Chu Chuyan glanced at her, a look of amusement in her gaze. \u201cWhen he saved your life today, he already touched everything there is to touch. Besides, this is part of the responsibilities of any live-in maidservant. Are you unwilling?\u201dSnow met her gaze. She always means what she says. Snow shivered, not daring to reply. She just tightly bit her lips, tears beginning to appear in her eyes.Zu An simply stood there, stupefied. What nonsense was this? Shoving another woman into your own husband\u2019s bed? Then again, Snow tried to kill me during the day. Let\u2019s play along see what exactly the relationship is between the two of them. And so he immediately sat down on the bed. \u201cMy dear Snow, come hither and help me disrobe.\u201dThe distant Chu Chuyan wrinkled her brows slightly. This fellow was vastly more shameless than she had imagined.Snow cast Chu Chuyan a pitiable glance, but the young mistress just ignored her and picked up a book to read. If Zu An was standing behind Chu Chuyan, he would\u2019ve immediately recognized this book as the romance novel he had noticed her reading earlier.Upon seeing the young mistress completely ignore her, Snow finally gave into despair. She unwilling walked forward, and cast Zu An a vicious stare. Pumping herself up, she muttered, \u201cGet on with it, if you must! I\u2019ll just think of it as being bitten by a dog.\u201d At the same time, a murderous, struggling look flickered in her eyes. She reached out to touch a slender needle hidden within her hair.Right at this moment, Chu Chuyan raised her head from the book she had been \u2018reading\u2019. She stared towards Snow, a reflective look in her eyes.Even Zu An was feeling rather queasy. I just wanted to play along and see what you guys are up to, but\u2026 hell, now I dunno. Should I go beast-mode or not?After a long moment, he finally made up his mind. Screw it. If you women aren\u2019t embarrassed by it, why the hell should I be? Y\u2019all want to play games? Fine, I\u2019ll play until the game ends. Let\u2019s see who breaks first! Now that his mind was settled, he grinned lecherously as he pounced atop Snow.A long while later, an agonized howl rang out from the bedsheets.\u201cNO FUCKIN\u2019 WAY!\u201dZu An was staring down at his privates in utter disbelief. He was so motionless, he might as well have been a statue. Chu Chuyan turned to glance at him, but then quickly cast her gaze aside, her face reddened. At the same time, a hint of unexpected pity could be seen in her eyes.Snow, who felt as though she had just been granted a reprieve from execution, wasn\u2019t so kind. She put away her hidden weapons while putting her clothes back out, then let out a series of mocking quips. \u201cIn the past, I thought that you were just a completely useless man\u2026 but now, I realize that I still thought too highly of you! So you aren\u2019t even a man at all! Ahahahaha, oh my god, I\u2019m going to die laughing.\u201dZu An didn\u2019t even have the presence of mind to argue with her. His eyes were filled with tears, and he turned and slowly left the room, his footsteps feeling incredibly heavy. This blow was simply too heavy for him. He was confident he could deal with any other problems, but\u2026 if he suffered from total erectile dysfunction, what was the point of it all?! His life\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t to become Sima Qian!After walking for some time, he just so happened to walk past a crooked tree. He mechanically took off his belt, then hung it around a branch on the tree. He had decided to just end it all. Who knows, maybe if I die I\u2019ll transmigrate back to my own world.But right at this moment, an ancient, hoarse voice suddenly rang out by his ears. \u201cYour privates have simply been affected by a very special sealing spell. It isn\u2019t completely hopeless.\u201dZu An turned to look, only to see a stooped old man standing by his side, carrying a hoe. The old man\u2019s face was covered with countless wrinkles, and he seemed so scrawny and tottering that a strong wind could blow him down.More memories began to drift into his mind. He vaguely remembered that this old man was their servant who was responsible for keeping the flower gardens clean. The old man rarely spoke and always kept to himself, and was either ignored or bullied by everyone in the estate. Everyone just referred to him as \u2018Old Mi\u2019.The past owner of Zu An\u2019s body had sympathized with Old Mi, as they were similarly looked down upon, and so had secretly given him some desserts before. This was why the current Zu An had some vague memories of him.However, none of that mattered to Zu An. The only thing that mattered was what he had just said. \u201cSealed? Who put a sealing spell on me?\u201d Could it be Chu Chuyan? But judging from her behavior, it doesn\u2019t seem like that.Old Mi shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. I imagine it was placed on you when you were very young.\u201d\u201cElder, do you know a way to unseal it?\u201d Zu An eagerly grabbed the old man by the arm. After having read so many webnovels, he knew that this could be no ordinary old man. Countless possibilities suddenly flooded his mind. I KNOW this trope! He must be a retired badass grandpa who, for various reasons, had to discard his former fame and secrete himself within the Chu clan as an ordinary gardener.He was going to latch onto this person firmly! There was no way he was going to let this opportunity go to waste!1. These are legendary playboys in Chinese history, their names are used sort of like how we would say Casanova or Adonis.2. Eileen Chang was a Chinese American author who wrote many famous novels like \u2018Lust, Caution\u2019.3. Sima Qian is considered to be China\u2019s foremost historian. He offended the emperor but in lieu of the death penalty, chose to let himself to become a eunuch so that he could complete his great ambitions of writing a full history of pre-Han dynasty China.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Old Mi gently stroked his beard. Perhaps he used a bit too much force, because a few strands accidentally fell down. He hurriedly tucked those strands into his sleeves, his eyes turning cold.\u201cWhat\u2019s the method?\u201d Zu An asked frantically, not noticing such minor details in the slightest.Old Mi cast him a sharp glance, then said, \u201cThe seal is located in a sensitive area which is extremely fragile. If we were to use outside force to disperse it, you could easily suffer internal damages. You have to rely on your own power to dissolve it. Once you reach the Master level of cultivation and your qi becomes spiritual, you\u2019ll naturally have the ability to unseal it.\u201d\u201cMaster? What level is that?\u201d Zu An had a blank look on his face.Old Mi frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know such rudimentary concepts? No wonder everyone says you are useless.\u201dOld Mi then began to explain, allowing Zu An to understand the cultivation levels of this world. The vast majority of cultivators were graded across nine ranks. At the first rank, you would learn to use unique breathing methods to harmonize with the natural world, drawing elemental ki into your body. This signified that one had formally embarked upon the path of cultivation. The second rank involved using that ki to temper your skin, making the absorption process faster. The third rank involved tempering the flesh. The fourth rank involved tempering the muscles. The fifth rank tempered the bones, the sixth rank tempered the marrow, the seventh rank tempered the blood, while the eighth rank tempered your internal organs and established a network of ki meridians throughout your body. The ninth rank tempered the brain and your senses, allowing the storage of raw ki.Once cultivators were able to gather the raw, unruly streams of ki in the body into a ki vortex, the ki would continuously strengthen your limbs and your bones, allowing you to finally break into the Master stage. If Masters were to then develop their soulsense, they would break through to the Grandmaster stage and be able to control the fates of all below this level.Above the Grandmaster stage was the \u2018Earth Immortal\u2019 stage. With but a wave of the hand, one could topple the mountains and overturn the seas, becoming akin to the gods of the ancient legends.\u201cTemper the skin, flesh, and bones? That\u2019s a rather casual way of setting up the levels,\u201d Zu An mused to himself, an odd look on his face. \u201cSo what comes after Earth Immortals?\u201d\u201cAfter Earth Immortals?\u201d Old Mi raised his head to stare into the stars, a hint of eagerness and anticipation in his gaze. \u201cSupposedly, one would then be able to wander through the stars and gain truly eternal life. Alas, it would seem that no one in all of history has ever reached this stage.\u201dZu An didn\u2019t care about this too much, as for now it was far too distant for him. He quickly brought the conversation back to the topic he cared about. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been told that I have no talent and am already an adult. How can I possibly reach the Master stage?\u201dOld Mi glanced at him. \u201cIt is indeed pointless for you to train in any ordinary techniques. I, however, just so happen to have a strange, ancient technique that I acquired in my early days. It just so happens to suit you perfectly.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about it?\u201d Zu An\u2019s heart clenched.Old Mi replied, \u201cOrdinary cultivators rely on using elemental stones, also known as elementum, as well as various medicines and herbs to help them absorb natural energy and use it to strengthen the body. The goal is to create ki-passageways throughout the body. Given your talent, however? Even putting aside the fact that you are already an adult, if someone gave you far, far more elementum than an ordinary person, you would at most be able to train to the third rank. Given how rare elementum is, who would be willing to waste it on someone with no future such as yourself?\u201cBut my technique is different. It is the essence of rebirth through destruction. If you want to master it, the only requirement is that you get beaten up. Repeatedly. The more badly you get beat up, the more easily you will break through to the next stage.\u201dZu An felt as though he was spinning in the wind. \u201cWhy would such a ridiculous, shitty technique even exist in this world?\u201dOld Mi was instantly enraged. \u201cIgnorant child. This divine technique is the only technique in the world that can grant etern-\u2026 ahem.\u201d He quickly caught himself and immediately changed the topic. \u201cHem-hem! Do you want to train in it or not?\u201d\u201cYes! Of course I want to train in it!\u201d By this point, Zu An was like a drowning man grasping at straws. For the sake of his pride and joy, even the most ridiculous of techniques was worth training. \u201cBut, the two of us have never even met. Why are you being so kind to me?\u201dOld Mi let out a long sigh. \u201cSolely because I am not long for this world. I do not wish for this technique to enter the dirt and be buried with me.\u201dOnly then did Zu An understand. \u201cElder, may I ask your venerable name? In the future, I will definitely bring this technique to new heights and ensure that your reputation is not besmirched.\u201d By now, he was naturally certain that \u2018Old Mi\u2019 wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s real name.\u201cYou should continue to address me as Old Mi. Heh heh\u2026 I\u2019m glad to hear you express that sentiment. Looks like I chose well.\u201d Old Mi let out a strange chuckle. \u201cTake this book back and slowly analyze it. If there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand, seek me out.\u201dOld Mi tossed a black scroll tome over, then turned to leave. In his heart, he was almost unable to hide his delight. Finally! After so many years, I\u2019ve finally found an appropriate receptacle!Many years ago, he had been given a top-secret mission. He had nearly died countless times before finally managing to acquire this secret manual, but afterwards he chose not to turn it in. Instead, he killed his comrades, feigned death, then hide and trained in the art in secret. Alas, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect secret. That organization seemed to have caught wind of him, and was most likely going to find him here soon.He had yet to master this marvelous art, and so he was completely incapable of truly fighting back against them. In the end, he had decided upon a \u2018golden cicada flees the shell\u2019 strategy, via a possession-rebirth technique he had acquired in his youth.Old Mi\u2019s current body was tottering and decrepit anyhow. He had long ago wanted to switch to a new body, and the current danger he was in had only solidified this decision. However, possession was no easy task. First and foremost, the target had to train in the same technique as him. Only then would he be able to pour his cultivation base into the target. Second, the person had to have a yin-dominant body.Possession was a highly dangerous endeavor; the possessor had to find a target that suited him almost perfectly. Old Mi himself was a eunuch; if he tried to possess a forceful, yang-dominant personality, the likely result would be that it would almost instantly burn him up alive.But\u2026 he was also rather unwilling to transfer himself into yet another eunuch. In every world, eunuchs dreamed of being full and complete men. Who would be willing to be reborn as a eunuch?As a result of these competing pressures, till now he had yet to find a suitable candidate. Now, he had finally encountered this useless son-in-law of the Chu clan. The child had been sealed in a fashion that made him equivalent to a eunuch, but he wasn\u2019t really a eunuch. Old Mi was confident that once he took over the child\u2019s body, he would be able to slowly repair it.Just as importantly, this person didn't seem to have any real family or friends. If he possessed this person, there wouldn\u2019t be many who would notice any strange mannerisms or personality changes. In addition, this person was the son-in-law of the Chu clan; in the future, he would have plenty of opportunities to win fortune and glory. And, he had an absolutely stunningly beautiful wife!Even a eunuch like Old Mi couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit excited when he thought about Chu Chuyan\u2019s beautiful visage.Zu An knew none of this, of course. He was excitedly and hopefully eyeing the scroll in his hand. This was his only hope, after all.The scroll seemed to be made out of silken gold, yet different from both. He couldn\u2019t tell what it was made from. Just as he was going to go ask Old Mi some questions, an icy voice suddenly rang out by his ears:\u201cDetected: Mountain Secret Scroll - [Phoenix Nirvana Sutra]. Consume it to activate a keyboard function?\u201dZu An was stunned. He never would\u2019ve imagined that he would acquire a secret manual with such ease. Aren\u2019t the \u2018Twelve Unknowable Places\u2019 supposed to be super-deadly and super-mysterious places? Aren\u2019t the scrolls supposed to be almost impossible to get?Despite his shock, he still replied in the affirmative without hesitate.A heartbeat later, the keyboard appeared before his hands. The scroll suddenly transformed into a streak of golden light and was sucked into the \u2018F2\u2019 key. The light glimmered across the energy lines which covered the key\u2026 and then, the keyboard suddenly powered on, with multiple keys now backlit.You have found your first secret manual and have activated the Troll/Rage system. Part of the lottery rewards system is now available.Troll System: As a dedicated Keyboard Warrior, your noble mission is to constantly drive the people around you berserk with rage. Once you have successfully trolled your target, the owner of the keyboard shall receive an amount of Rage points commensurate to how furious the target has become. You can spend the Rage points to purchase items, use techniques, and play the lottery\u2026Zu An noticed a holographic display suddenly appear above the keyboard. The explanation had appeared on this holographic display, which also had a few buttons on it. He was able to move the cursor to various options. The options available were \u2018Lottery\u2019, \u2018Shop\u2019, and a number of other commands which were blurred under a mosaic for now.For now, the \u2018Lottery\u2019 command was shining, while the \u2018Shop\u2019 command was grayed out. Most likely, it would be the next function to unlock.At the bottom of this virtual screen was something which seemed akin to an \u2018item bar\u2019 or \u2018skill bar\u2019 in RPG\u2019s. Alas, there was nothing there for now. At the very top of the screen there was a short line of text:Current Rage Points: 0.Zu An was puzzled. Earlier, I clearly pissed off Snow so much that her period was about to arrive early. Why didn\u2019t I receive any rage points for it? Must be because back then the keyboard wasn\u2019t activated.He moved the cursor to the \u2018Lottery\u2019 command, then hit the enter key on the keyboard. A new paragraph of words appeared on the screen.For each 100 Rage points you expend, you may draw one lottery ticket. As this is your first time activating a keyboard function, you are permitted to draw three tickets for free. The drop rates for these three tickets have been greatly increased, and the specific drops will be randomized. In the future, all lottery drops will be based off the user\u2019s level. Do you wish to begin drawing your tickets? Y/N.Holy shit, so this is a newbie gift package? Zu An excitedly clicked \u2018yes\u2019. A spot of light suddenly appeared on the keyboard and began randomly flashing across all the different keys.Zu An watched with hot, eager eyes. What sort of reward would come up? A level 999 artifact saber? An incomparably powerful pet? A hot little fairy maiden companion wouldn\u2019t be bad either\u2026As he was salivating over the possibilities, he saw the spot of light suddenly come to a halt on the \u2018space\u2019 key. Three words suddenly appeared on the screen: \u201cThanks for playing!\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201c???\u201d\u201c??????\u201dZu An was speechless. Didn\u2019t you say the drop rates would be greatly increased? I want my Midas touch! I want my completely overpowered MC powerup system! Everything had seemed so incredibly exciting, but in the end all he got was a \u2018thanks for playing\u2019. This keyboard system must be the laughingstock amongst your fellow systems in whatever system-universe you come from!Do you wish to continue drawing prizes? Y/N.\u201d These words appeared on the screen.\u201cYou can go straight to hell!\u201d Zu An gritted his teeth. Just as he was about to push the \u2018yes\u2019 button, a sudden thought came to his mind. He hurriedly ran to a basin of water, washed his face, and only then drew his second prize.This time, he didn\u2019t let himself get lost in wild flights of fantasy. He stared unblinkingly at the spot of light, memorized how much time the light spent atop each key. It spent the most time atop the \u2018space\u2019 bar, the second most time on the various numbers, and flitted through the various letters at lightning speed.I bet the amount of time it spends on each key corresponds to how valuable the prize is. Still, by now he had mostly given up his wild fantasies. Anything would be better than the space bar!His prayers were apparently answered. In the end, the spot of light came to a halt atop the \u2018Q\u2019 key. Something appeared on the screen, and this time it wasn\u2019t a \u2018thank you for playing\u2019.Zu An felt overjoyed\u2026 but quickly, his smile froze into a rictus of a grin. Why is it\u2026 that this \u2018reward\u2019 seems like the steel wool pads we used for scrubbing pots in the kitchen? Is the system encouraging me to walk the path of a chef? Or perhaps the path of a transmigrant merchant?Hell, I used to buy those things in packs of four! Why the hell would it appear in this reward system?! Zu An was beginning to question the meaning of life itself.Congratulations! You have won a \u2018Heiress Ball of Delights\u2019!1. So, this is based off a Chinese internet meme which states that there are rich women who pay large sums of money to hire boytoys, then do some really SM stuff to them. One of the meme-jokes is that one of the things these rich women like to do is to use steel wool pads to scrub their boytoys, uh, \u2018privates\u2019. The \u2018artifacts\u2019 used to do this are jokingly referred to as a \u2018Rich Lady\u2019s Ball of Delights\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An: \u201cWhat the actual fu-\u2026\u201d For some reason, he felt sure that the system was laughing at him! Right at this moment, a new line of words appeared on the screen next to the ball of steel wool. Not giving up hope, he leaned over to read it.Heiress Ball of Delights: Legends say that this artifact is capable of granting rich women incredibly joy and unspeakable delight. Alas, behind this great joy was once the tremendous suffering and agony endured by countless boytoys. Thus, a particularly clever boytoy devised this item to protect himself.Artifact Effect: After using this artifact, any agony inflicted upon you by a woman with more money than you is transformed into sheer bliss. Warning \u2013 this artifact will not actually lower the amount of damage you take. However, your life will be locked to your last drop of health when a rich woman inflicts otherwise-lethal damage to you.Do you wish to store this item into your item bar? You can use it when you wish by hitting the \u2018Q\u2019 key.Oh god, stop fucking with me! Zu An stared at the now-materialized ball of steel wool in his hand. He was tempted to hurl it to the ground. What the hell is this thing good for? It\u2019s almost completely useless, AND it comes with a bunch of prerequisite conditions. I\u2019m not gonna becoming some rich lady\u2019s boytoy. How the hell am I supposed to use this?Stone-faced, Zu An stored the ball of steel wool into his item bar. He then ran over to the basin and washed his face again. Still not convinced that he\u2019d washed the bad luck away, he then washed his hands a few extra times also. Only then did he finally choose to draw his third reward.The ball of light once more more began to flicker across the keyboard as Zu An watched tensely. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be the space bar. Please don\u2019t be the Q key\u2026\u201dFinally, the ball of light came to a halt atop the \u2018B\u2019 key. An icy voice once more rang out by his ears. \u201cCongratulations on winning the \u2018Poisonous Prick\u2019!\u201dZu An: \u201c?!?!\u201d He nearly spat out a mouthful of blood. This keyboard is absolutely lewd. What the hell type of reward is this? It wasn\u2019t until he saw the image of a pitch-black dagger appear on the screen that he knew that it was his own thoughts that were lewd.Poisonous Prick: Once, there was a person who nervously licked this dagger just as victory was within his grasp. And then, he died. Before he died, the last thing he said was \u2018poisonous prick\u2019!Artifact Effect: This is a cursed dagger. Anyone injured by this dagger will immediately perish.Finally, Zu An let out a sigh of relief. Although its name was a little bit odd, in practice it was essentially an incredibly powerful weapon. The main problem for right now was that he still had to manage to first injure his foe with it.After having seen how powerful Snow and Chu Chuyan were, he knew that he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to even touch them in a real fight, much less actually injure them. Mm. I better keep it low-key for now. Sneak attacks are the name of the game! In \u2018Duke of Mount Deer\u2019, Wei Xiaobao was able to use one sharp dagger to win the love of seven beautiful ladies. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to use mine to win at least seventy.Wait a sec. Zu An blinked. If I accidentally scratch myself with it, will I die? He stared at the shiny dagger in his hand. For some reason, he had the urge to try it out. However, in the end he squashed the thought of using himself as a guinea pig. That\u2019d be a dumb way to die.Zu An hurriedly tried to make another lottery drawing, but alas\u2026 no matter what he did, the system didn\u2019t respond. The only thing he saw were the words, Not Enough Rage Points.\u201cTrolling for rage? That\u2019s easy!\u201d Zu An stroked his chin as his mind turned towards Snow. Then, he suddenly began to cackle. Eeep. I\u2019m laughing like I\u2019m the villain in this story. But he couldn\u2019t help it!Alas, now that he was thinking about Snow, he couldn\u2019t help but think about the embarrassing events of tonight. His face began to twitch, and his joy at acquiring a priceless treasure instantly vanished. His first and foremost priority was to repair his little mini-me.Wait a second. I think the [Phoenix Nirvana Sutra] was sucked into the keyboard? Zu An\u2019s face instantly turned ashen. Was he really destined to be a eunuch in the future? He hurriedly turned to stare at the keyboard, only to see that only the F2 key remained lit. He pressed down on it, and some words appeared on the screen: Do you wish to train in the [Phoenix Nirvana Sutra]? Y/N.He hurriedly pressed \u2018yes\u2019, only to see specks of golden light float out from the F2 key and scatter over him. He felt a warm and incredibly comfortable sensation pervade his body.Instant max level! C\u2019mon, instant max level! Zu An chanted repeatedly. After a while, the golden light finally dissipated. He opened his eyes. The air seemed a little sweeter and fresher, and the world itself seemed to have changed. Time to test this sucker out. He delivered a full-force punch against a nearby rock.\u201cOWOWOWOWOW!\u201d Zu An nursed his hand, tears threatening to spill down his face. Nothing changed at all! Wait. That\u2019s not true. His skin was now covered with nine incomparably complex rune-formations. Each formation was empty in the middle, and the nine were scattered throughout his body but were connected to each other by lines.A moment later, these formations slowed dimmed and vanished within his skin. Just as Zu An was about to panic, he saw the runes once more flicker inside his body.\u201cWhat the hell are these things?\u201d Zu An noticed that there were some strange golden things hidden within the center of the lower-most formation inside his body. He suddenly remembered what the mysterious old man had said about this technique, and its unique points. He lowered his head, staring at his bloody fist. Suddenly, it all made sense.This bullshit technique really does require sustaining energies to level up. He had played pleeenty of video games in his past life, and so he quickly recognized that the keyboard had simplified the way in which skills were acquired. All he had to do was fill up each formation with that golden stuff, and he would probably be able to level up.As for the golden stuff? Clearly, he could only acquire it by getting beat up.Well, if it\u2019s for the sake of mini-me\u2026 ahem, for my pride and joy! Even though this is a bullshit technique, I\u2019ll still train in it. Zu An gritted his teeth and delivered yet another punch towards the stone wall. This time, however, the amount of golden stuff in the formation didn\u2019t perceptibly change, even though the amount of pain he felt wasn\u2019t lessened. Zu An stared at his fists.By now, he more-or-less knew what was going on. Unlike his first punch, he was already mentally prepared for what would happen and so his mind had unconsciously protected his body by causing him to hold back. As a result, the benefits were clearly much less.So I can\u2019t even train using self-flagellation? Looks like the only choice is for someone else to beat me up. But who? God fucking DAMMIT! The more he thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed and the angrier he became.Right at this moment, he suddenly noticed a rat scrounging for food near his foot. He couldn\u2019t help but feel even angrier. My life really sucks. Living in this crappy place is one thing, but living in a warren of rats?! He delivered a flying kick to the rat, sending it flying through the window. Just as he was admiring his awesome soccer skills, someone suddenly kicked the door open.\u201cDid you throw this rat?!\u201d A crisp voice rang out, followed by a young lady stepping through the doorway. She was short and slender, her lips red and her teeth white. Her hair was short but neatly cut, and her bangs just barely reached her eyes. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that she was holding a rat in her hands, Zu An would\u2019ve called her an adorable little beauty.Squeak! Squeak! The rat chirped and struggled unceasingly. Zu An warned, \u201cCareful, the rat might bite you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m afraid of these things,\u201d the young woman said, then suddenly clenched her hand. The rat let out one final miserable shriek, then fell completely limp.Gulp. Zu An swallowed, hard. Is this really a girl? He watched as the young woman tossed the rat corpse to the side, then wiped her hand disdainfully on her dress.Finally, the girl stared icily at him. \u201cI have no idea what in the world my big sister was thinking. She brought you back, but she didn\u2019t punish you?\u201dZu An could hear a chewing sound coming from outside. Just as he was about to ask about it, he heard her words and felt shocked. \u201cUh, big sister?\u201dOnly then did he notice that she looked rather similar to Chu Chuyan. However, she was clearly much younger. Most likely, this was the Second Miss of the Chu clan, Chu Huanzhao. His memories had slowly merged with his host body\u2019s, and he was now aware of many more things. The only thing he didn\u2019t understand was why the Chu clan had given the Second Miss such an ugly name.The young woman before him was dressed in skin-tight leathers that only accentuated her slender waist and her perk bottom. A leather whip was fastened to her waist. She looks like one hot little pepper. She looks completely different from her ice-cold big sister. They came from the same mother, so why are they so diametrically different?\u201cWhat the hell are you staring at you, you dog?\u201d Chu Huanzhao was already very unhappy with him, and upon seeing him eye her with his beady little eyes, she instantly grew even more vexed.You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +10 Rage!Zu An noticed that the \u2018rage counter\u2019 above his keyboard had changed from \u20180\u2019 to \u201810\u2019. He felt overjoyed. This girl seems to have a terrible temper. I\u2019d be shortchanging myself if I didn\u2019t seize this chance to earn some more Rage points.His eyes spun in his head as he came up with a plan. \u201cHonestly, I have a question I have to ask you. Your big sister has a very pretty name, \u2018Chuyan\u2019. Why did they give you such an ugly name, \u2018Counterattack\u2019?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +666 Rage!Zu An was badly frightened. That\u2019s\u2026 a pretty extreme amount of rage.Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes and face reddened with fury. \u201cPagh! \u2018Chuyan\u2019 was the name she gave herself! Her real name was \u2018Zhaodi\u2019!\u201dZhaodi?! A strange look appeared on Zu An\u2019s face as he tried (and failed) to equate his elegant, white-robed freebie wife gracefully drifting about like a fairy Immortal, yet having such a vulgar name.Zhaodi? Huanzhao? Wait a sec, I seem to recall that the eldest son is named \u2018Youzhao\u2019?\u201cAre you mocking me?\u201d Chu Huanzhao interrupted his musings.\u201cNo, no!\u201d He could sense fiery sparks within her eyes, and so he hastily denied it. \u201cOh, right. So why don\u2019t you just change your name also?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +199 Rage!\u201cI WANT to, but my parents won\u2019t let me, nor will my sister! Hmph. She was able to change her name, and now she doesn\u2019t give a damn about others.\u201d When the young woman recalled how she had been mocked all her life by her classmates, she couldn\u2019t help but reveal a look of grief and rage.\u201cW-wait a sec!\u201d Chu Huanzhao suddenly remembered. \u201cStop trying to make friends with me. I\u2019ve come to get a reckoning for last night!\u201dZu An was happily counting all the rage he had just accumulated. By now, he had 875 Rage points, enough to draw eight prizes! This time, I have to get something better than the useless crap I drew last time, right? And so he subconsciously gave a rather uncaring reply. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure what happened last night was just a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cYou climbed into my bed. How is that a misunderstanding?\u201d Chu Huanzhao smiled coldly.You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +10 Rage!Huh. Why isn\u2019t there more Rage? Clearly, she has a lot of issues about her name in particular.Zu An waved his hands. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you stop me? You could\u2019ve called for guards or something!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s pale face instantly turned beet-red. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened either. I think I was asleep.\u201d\u201cWell, and I was drunk. I don\u2019t know how I ended up in your room. Honestly, I\u2019m sure something strange is afoot.\u201d For now, Zu An cast aside the notion of accumulating more Rage. The most important task at hand was to pacify this little hell-brat. I wonder if she knows martial arts. Young people tended to not know their own strength and didn\u2019t know when to hold back. If she accidentally killed him, he wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to go cry.\u201cAre you suggesting that I perhaps dragged you into my room?\u201d Chu Huanzhao grinned coldly. \u201cAs the saying goes, wine is the middleman for lust. You could\u2019ve gone anywhere after you got drunk, but you just so happened to choose my bed. This is proof that you normally are lusting after my body!\u201dZu An stared at her completely flat chest, then let out a long sigh. \u201cYou are a kid. How could I have lewd thoughts about you? If I really did have lewd thoughts, I would\u2019ve headed to your sister\u2019s room.\u201dChu Huanzhao instantly exploded. \u201cI\u2019m a GROWNUP, ok? Sometimes, I even help manage some of the family business! I\u2019m not like you, you trash! All you do is eat and sleep. How dare you talk down to me?!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +99 Rage!Zu An secretly chortled. Clearly, no matter what world you were in, the thing which young adults hated the most was others treating them like little kids.\u201cYou know, if you keep glaring and huffing and puffing like that, nobody would ever have the guts to get married to you in the future. Honestly, you should try and act a bit more womanly. Maybe try your hand at needlework and some more lady-like skills?\u201d Zu An spoke in a heartfelt, meaningful manner as he looked at her, his eyes filled with warmth and kindness. \u201cBe a good girl, now. This is all for your own good.\u201dAlthough he was a bit worried about being beaten to death, he just couldn\u2019t help himself when he thought about all the potential Rage points at stake!\u201cAHHHHHHH!\u201d Chu Huanzhao felt as though she was about to go crazy. What the hell is wrong with his bastard? Why\u2019s he lecturing me as though he was one of my elders?You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +33 Rage!+33 Rage! +33 Rage! +33 Rage! \u2026Zu An nearly chortled aloud as he watched his Rage points begin to skyrocket. This little girl is so easily provoked. It probably wouldn\u2019t be this easy farming points off of that icy wife of mine.\u201cDo you want to beat me up? Don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m your brother-in-law! If you abuse your elders, the heavens will punish you with lightning!\u201d Zu An started to get a little anxious. He could tell that the young lady was so hopping mad, steam was about to rise from the top of her head. If she got any angrier, she\u2019ll probably lose all her hair and go bald.But then again\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t really matter too much if she really did attack him. She had short arms and short legs. It probably wouldn\u2019t be too dangerous if such a pretty young lady actually did pound her arms against his chest. In fact, maybe it would help him break through to the next level of his technique!You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +55 Rage!Before Zu An had the chance to feel happy with himself, he felt an enormous surge of power blast towards his chest. He vomited out a mouthful of blood while falling backwards onto the bed.Chu Huanzhao retracted her fist, then let out a disdainful sneer. \u201cY\u2019know, for a moment there I actually thought you might have some real skills, given how hard you were trying to piss me off. Pagh! You are as weak as a chicken!\u201d1. Gawd, I have to explain here. In the original Chinese, the name of the item is \u2018dagger with poison inside\u2019, but the author chose to use a character for dagger that is a homophone for, uh, female private parts. Ahem. Doesn\u2019t really work in English, so I flipped it to \u2018Prick\u2019. I did my best, but it\u2019s legitimately funnier in Chinese. And lewd. Very lewd.2. Huanzhao literally means \u2018Counterattack\u2019.3. Zhaodi literally means \u2018summoning your sister-in-law\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An stared at her tiny, pale little fist. Yet again, he was beginning to doubt the meaning of life itself.\u201cHonestly, there\u2019s no point in me personally beating up someone as weak as you.\u201d Chu Huanzhao suddenly whistled towards the outside. \u201cC\u2019mere, Bootlicker!\u201dZu An was puzzled. Huh? How could such a young girl have bootlickers following her around? Are the men of this world really such pansies?\u201cWOOOOOF!\u201dUpon hearing a ferocious barking sound coming from afar, Zu An quickly realized that he had misunderstood. So her \u2018bootlicker\u2019 was actually a dog! But honestly, what type of name is that? Heh, heh, heh. Seems like weird names is a fort of this family.Moments later, his smirk quickly vanished. A panther-sized creature had suddenly bounded inside, and it was now staring at him with its oily green eyes. Okay, this thing is technically shaped like a dog, but\u2026 it is way too freakin\u2019 huge!\u201cBe a good boy, Bootlicker!\u201d Chu Huanzhao squatted down to rub the monster\u2019s head, and as she did so the beast wagged its tail joyfully. Clearly, it was enjoying the process.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but gulp as he stared at the massive beast in front of him. \u201cYou call this thing a dog?!\u201d Blood was still leaking from the corner of the creature\u2019s mouth. Finally, he realized why he had heard chewing sounds coming from outside earlier.\u201cScared now?\u201d Chu Huanzhao let out a series of diabolical laughs, then pointed straight at him. \u201cBootlicker, bite him! Bite him hard!\u201dUpon hearing the command, the huge dog instantly leapt towards Zu An in a very smooth manner. Clearly, this wasn\u2019t its first rodeo.Zu An was almost scared witless when he saw that giant bloody maw fly towards him. If I let this huge thing bite me, I\u2019ll probably lose an arm! What scared him the most was, he knew just how deadly rabies could be. Who knew what sort of deadly viruses the dog\u2019s drool contained? This world didn\u2019t have rabies shots. If he was infected, he\u2019d be doomed.And besides, the beast had just eaten a few rats alive. Maybe it was now carrying some rat plagues!Zu An\u2019s body reaction even faster than his mind. He frantically leapt to one side. The dog landed atop the chair next to the bed, and it instantly shattered into countless pieces.Oh my sweet Lord Almighty\u2026 Zu An was pretty sure that his body wasn\u2019t as tough as that chair. He frantically began to flee. His original plan was to run next to Chu Huanzhao and hide behind her, as she had already promised she wouldn\u2019t beat him up personally\u2026 but the little girl had already run outside the room. She was now watching his misfortunes from a nearby window with a look of delight on her face. Even worse, she had shut the door behind her!In his mind, Zu An cursed her and her relatives a thousand times over as he began to run in circles around the table. There was no way he could outspeed that huge dog, so all he could do was repeatedly run in circles around the furniture to keep away from it.The dog was simply too damn big, so big it couldn\u2019t simply go underneath the table and reach him that way. This was the only reason Zu An was still safe.Alas, his body was weak to begin with, and just earlier today it had been hit by lightning. Seconds ago, it had been punched as well. After just a few minutes, Zu An felt as though his lungs were about to explode. Several times earlier, he had sensed a cold sensation from the back of his head, as though an enormous maw had emitted its foul-smelling breath just inches away from him. He was running on pure willpower right now.Actually, it was already quite surprising that he had managed to last for this long. It was most likely thanks to him training in the [Phoenix Nirvana Sutra], which had slightly increased his physical strength. The problem was that he had just started training in it a very short while ago; there was no way for him to actually use it to overcome this huge, ferocious beast.\u201cYou dumb mutt! Why do you have to chase him around the table? Just leap over the damn thing!\u201d The young lady watching outside stamped her feet in displeasure. Her voice, normally crisp and pleasant, now sounded like the exhortations of demons.The huge dog seemed to understand its master\u2019s words. It let out a loud howl, then leapt upwards and began to clamber across the table towards Zu An.Zu An frantically lifted up the entire table, using it to defend against the dog. However, the dog\u2019s enormous head almost instantly smashed straight through the table and chomped straight at him. Thankfully, the rest of the dog\u2019s body was stuck behind the table, while Zu An himself was now lying on the ground and frantically kicking at the dog\u2019s belly. At this critical moment, he squeezed out every drop of strength he had in him. Alas, the difference in power was simply too vast; the dog\u2019s head was moving closer and closer to him.A foul odor swept across Zu An as giant gobs of doggy saliva splattered across his face. The dog continued to scratch furiously at the table, tearing through it like wet paper. By now, the table was filled with multiple holes.Zu An\u2019s heart turned cold as he saw how dagger-sharp the dog\u2019s teeth and claws were. I\u2019m gonna get killed by a dog. Damn, I\u2019m a disgrace to all transmigrators.Wait a second. Dagger? Suddenly, Zu An was hit by a flash of inspiration. He thought of the Poisonous Prick he had won. He frantically pressed \u2018B\u2019 on the keyboard, summoning it forth from the item bar. Just as it appeared in his hand, the table finally gave up the ghost and shattered apart completely. The dog\u2019s massive mouth clamped down towards him\u2026 and it just so happened to bite the dagger.Given that the dog\u2019s name was \u2018Bootlicker\u2019, it naturally loved to lick random objects. Bootlicker almost reflexively gave the dagger a lick, causing a tiny wound to appear on the tip of its tongue. And then\u2026 a series of strange, ashy black runes instantly appeared across the surface of its entire body. It trembled once, then fell down to the ground, not a hint of life remaining.\u201cIt actually died?\u201d Zu An let out a sigh of relief. Right now, he was completely spent. He just lay there on the ground, unable to move so much as a finger.\u201cBootlicker! What\u2019s wrong?!\u201d Chu Huanzhao, watching from outside, was certain that her beloved dog was about to win\u2026 but then, all of a sudden, everything seemed to change. Completely confused, she immediately ran inside to take a look. Alas, no matter what she tried or said, the dog didn\u2019t respond at all.\u201cHow dare you kill my Bootlicker?!\u201d Chu Huanzhao finally understood that her dog was dead, and she exploded with fury.You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +233 Rage!Zu An didn\u2019t even have the energy to respond, but he did subconsciously transfer the Poisonous Prick back into his item bar. It was better to be safe than sorry, after all. Best keep it hidden unless absolutely necessary. Just now, the huge dog and the table had blocked the girl\u2019s line of site. She probably didn\u2019t see exactly what happened.\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for Bootlicker\u2019s death!\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes were welling up with tears. Her parents were always busy with clan affairs, while her sister almost never stayed at home. She didn\u2019t have many playmates in the estate; it could be said that Bootlicker was her only friend.Suddenly, a tiny but furious foot came stomping down atop Zu An\u2019s prone body.+10 Rage! +10 Rage! +10 Rage! \u2026Zu An let out a muffled groan. He was simply too exhausted and unable to dodge. Thankfully, the foot landed on his buttocks. The fleshy parts just barely managed to cushion the blow.Seeing him just lie there, Chu Huanzhao only grew even angrier. Suddenly, she drew the whip from her waist and, with a flick of her wrist, lashed him with it.\u201cAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201d Zu An had been feeling completely powerless, but this strike was simply too painful, so painful that he actually sat up straight.Chu Huanzhao let out a satisfied nod when she saw his ridiculous reaction. \u201cScared now? My sister was worried about others bullying me, so she found this weapon just for me. It\u2019s called a \u2018Wailing Whip\u2019! It\u2019ll amplify tenfold any pain my enemies feel! There\u2019s no one who can withstand such pain.\u201d\u201cWailing Whip?\u201d Zu An swallowed, hard. The name alone was proof that this was a nasty piece of work. Amplify pain tenfold? No wonder that hurt so much!But what really surprised him was that single strike had apparently filled up the golden matter in his first formation by quite a bit. The increase was far greater than what he had gained from punching the stone wall. In fact, the first formation was almost full. It must\u2019ve been from the combined damaged he had sustained from her punch and her kick.This really is a bullshit technique! Zu An mentally cursed out the technique\u2019s creator a thousand times over. That guy had to be a masochist of the highest order!However, he was really curious as to what would happen once the formation was completely full. Judging from how much it had just filled up, a few more hits from the whip would probably do the trick.But he couldn\u2019t help but shudder when he recalled the literally soul-incinerating pain he had just suffered. A few more hits? He couldn\u2019t even take a single hit more!If it was just enduring some pain, that was one thing. The problem was, his body was simply too weak. He had been hit by lightning, then punched in the chest, then bit at by a dog. He felt as though he was about to expire at any moment. In fact, he strongly suspected that the next whip-strike would claim his life.Chu Huanzhao, upon seeing him fall silent, was certain that he was now properly frightened. She didn\u2019t continue to lash him. Instead, she said: \u201cHmph! Scared now, huh? If you kneel down and kowtow and apologize, then lick my shoes clean, maybe I\u2019ll be in a good mood and spare your life.\u201dShe arrogantly sat down on the chair, crossed her legs, then wiggled her feet at him. Her legs were actually quite long and slender. If this picture was posted online back in Zu An\u2019s world, plenty of people would\u2019ve left comments marveling at them.\u201cPatoey!\u201d Zu An was enraged. There might be some perverts who would actually look forward to a chance like this, but not him!Chu Huanzhao smirked. \u201cIt seems you have some spirit in you. How about this? Let\u2019s make a wager.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of wager?\u201d Zu An was a bit nervous. This little sister-in-law of his was clearly a massive sadist. He had to be careful.Chu Huanzhao waved her whip. \u201cIf you can take three hits of my whip without screaming in agony, I\u2019ll no longer blame you for killing my Bootlicker. What do you say?\u201dA hint of excitement flashed through her eyes. No ordinary person could withstand the pain inflicted by a whip that amplified agony tenfold. The reason why she even offered this wager was to first give him hope, then give him despair. She wanted to see him struggle to control his pain, then fail to do so and let loose a howl of agony. Only then would the hatred in her heart be lessened.She really is a pervert! Just as Zu An was about to refuse, yet another flash of inspiration struck him. He suddenly thought of the Ball of Delights he had won earlier. Back then, he had assumed it was useless gag reward, but it seemed to be perfect for the situation before him.\u201cFine! I accept your wager!\u201d Zu An said in a low voice. The only thing that worried him right now was, what if the keyboard\u2019s description was unreliable? If the Ball of Delights didn't have the effect it purportedly had, he would be doomed.\u201cWait a second! What if you lose?\u201d Chu Huanzhao asked.\u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d Zu An could almost swear that he saw two little horns emerging from the top of this little beauty\u2019s head. She really did seem like a little demon.A hint of inexplicable excitement flashed through Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf you lose, I\u2019ll grant you the right to kneel down and lick my shoes.\u201dZu An was speechless. Again with the licking? How did the Chu clan produce a pervert like you?! \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, unless you also agree to lick my shoes if I win.\u201dChu Huanzhao began to smirk. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in a position to bargain. First, you have to make amends for killing my dog. If you want to make a bet about licking shoes, you\u2019ll have to win this first bet.\u201d In her heart, she didn\u2019t think he stood the slightest chance.\u201cFine!\u201d Zu An was growing rather angry now as well. This little girl was simply too much of a freak. It was time for him to teach her the real meaning of the word freaky.Just as Chu Huanzhao was about to start whipping, Zu An hurriedly said, \u201cWait a sec!\u201dChu Huanzhao frowned. \u201cAre you backing out?\u201d\u201cLemme grab some water first.\u201d Zu An needed an opportunity to activate the Ball of Delights. Chu Huanzhao snorted, but didn\u2019t stop him. She was in no rush.While drinking some water, Zu An secretly called forth the Ball of Delights. He stared at the sparkling steel wool pad, then swallowed hard. So how am I supposed to use this thing? I don\u2019t actually have to scrub myself\u2026 there, do I?This item can be activated by scrubbing it against any part of your skin. These words suddenly appeared on the holographic screen, as though someone somewhere had heard his thoughts.Zu An had no time to analyze things. Back towards Chu Yuanzhao, he quickly scrubbed his hand with the steel wool, at which point he noticed that an extra line of words had appeared beneath the Ball of Delights\u2019 description on the screen.Activation successful. For the next hour, any pain which a woman richer than you causes to you will instead be transformed into euphoria. Warning \u2013 this artifact will not actually lower the amount of damage you take. However, your life will be locked to your last drop of health when a rich woman inflicts otherwise-lethal damage to you.Uses remaining: 2/3Zu An wanted to curse it, but no longer had the strength to do so. This piece of garbage\u2026 not only is it almost useless, it\u2019s not even unlimited usage?! Judging from the looks of it, he could only use it two more times. This keyboard was clearly devised by the most unscrupulous of fiends!\u201cAre you ready yet? Stop dawdling over there.\u201d A dissatisfied voice rang out from behind him. Clearly, she was growing impatient.1. In Chinese, the term \u2018bootlicker\u2019 is literally \u2018licking dog\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An turned over, grabbed a chair, then sat down. \u201cLet\u2019s begin. I only have one request \u2013 don\u2019t aim for my face. I rely on my good looks to keep myself fed.\u201dChu Huanzhao ground her teeth in fury, but she didn\u2019t want her parents or her sister to find out about any of this, so she assented. \u201cFine. I won\u2019t hit your face.\u201d With a snap of her wrist, she sent the whip howling through the air, emitting a terrifying sound as it struck him in the chest. It tore a huge gaping hole in his clothes, and blood instantly splattered everywhere.But\u2026 Chu Huanzhao\u2019s smile quickly began to freeze, then curdle. Contrary to her expectations, there was no howl of agony, much less tortured sniveling or tears. There was nothing at all. He simply sat there peacefully on the seat. The only difference was, he had a rather\u2026 strange\u2026 look on his face.Just now, Zu An hadn\u2019t felt any pain at all. Instead, he felt a sensation of extreme euphoric pleasure. Of course he had a \u2018strange\u2019 look on his face! He felt like a man lost in a desert who was suddenly given a bite out of a juicy, frozen watermelon. He felt like a scholar who had placed first in the imperial exams. He felt such rapture, he almost let out a pleased moan.But, considering his surroundings, he used all his willpower to refrain from emitting any strange sounds. He didn\u2019t want word to spread that he was some sort of masochist who moaned in pleasure when he was hit.\u201cEeeep?!\u201d Chu Huanzhao stared at him with wide-eyed shock. This was all completely different to what she had expected. He must be forcing himself to remain silent and putting on airs of indifference. Yeah. That\u2019s gotta be it! Last time I hit him, he immediately started to wail. He\u2019s probably just forcing himself to remain silent for the sake of this wager!Chu Huanzhao clenched her teeth, then delivered another strike with her whip. She knew better than anyone else just how terrifying the Wailing Whip was. It was possible for some people with incredible willpower to endure one strike, but there was no way to endure the second one.The second strike landed on Zu An\u2019s chest as well. Combined with the first, the two had left an enormous bloody X across his chest. Chu Huanzhao stared at him eagerly. Let\u2019s see if you scream this time.Instead, Zu An\u2019s response was\u2026 \u201cHmm? Mmm\u2026\u201dThere was nothing he could do. He was already controlling himself to the maximum extent possible. In fact, he was actually embarrassed by how much pleasure he was currently feeling. He felt as though a brand new world had been exposed to him.Chu Huanzhao felt as though her hairs were about to stand up on end. Everything that had happened today was completely opposite of what she had expected. She pondered for a long moment, then decided to switch her strikes to a different location. Maybe his chest is already completely numb from injuries.She took a deep breath, then launched the third strike against his leg. Alas, once again she was disappointed. Judging from the look on Zu An\u2019s face, her \u2018opponent\u2019 was clearly at the verge of breaking down and succumbing to the agony she had unleashed, but in the end he didn\u2019t make a single sound.\u201cI\u2026 win, right?\u201d Zu An noticed that the second formation was almost half-full by now. Seems like this little biddy really went all out in whacking me.\u201cThis isn\u2019t possible!\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes grew huge. She stared at the whip in her hand, beginning to question everything she knew. Maybe the whip is broken?After pondering for a moment, she walked over to Zu An and handed the whip to him. \u201cHit me with it and see what happens.\u201dZu An instantly grew alert. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cStop jabbering and hit me! Just remember, don\u2019t hit me on the face.\u201d Chu Huanzhao jutted her head up proudly, a disbelieving look on her face. She then closed her eyes, her lashes quivering.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but sigh as he looked at her perfectly smooth and pale oval-shaped face. The women of the Chu clan are all weirdos, but I have to admit, they have good genes.There was no way he was going to hit her on the face. It wasn\u2019t because he was a feminist; rather, he was worried about what the Chu clan would do to him once they found out.Suddenly, he began to chuckle. \u201cI swear, all my life I\u2019ve never heard of someone making a request like this. I promise to satisfy you.\u201d This little wench hit me hard as hell. Time to give her a taste of her own medicine.And so, he lashed out viciously with the whip. Alas, he underestimated how much damage his body had taken. Even though the pain was all converted, he still had no strength left. It was a miracle that he was still breathing. There was no way he could hit with any real power.This lash could be described as soft and weak\u2026 but the strange thing was, as soon as the whip touched Chu Huanzhao, she immediately let out a miserable screech and clutched at the tiny wound in agony. \u201cThat HURTS!\u201dZu An stared at her, watching as her tears came cascading down. For the first time, he rejoiced in having drawn the Ball of Delights as his prize.\u201cYou bastard! Why\u2019d you hit so hard?!\u201d Chu Huanzhao clutched at her wound with one hand while furiously wiping away her tears with the other.Zu An was speechless. \u201cYou clearly hit me way harder just now.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you scream?\u201d Chu Huanzhao stared at him curiously. She herself was quite aware that the amount of force he had used was far less than what she had used.Zu An coughed lightly, then said with a calm look on his face, \u201cA real man will never scream in pain.\u201d Sometimes, you gotta fake it until you make it.Chu Huanzhao blinked, then nodded in an uncertain manner. \u201cI-it looks like I underestimated you. Fine. You win. I won\u2019t blame you for killing Bootlicker.\u201dAfter speaking, she turned and immediately moved to depart. She wanted to hurry over to find her maidservant and apply a poultice to her wound. I hope it doesn\u2019t leave a scar.However, Zu An stopped her. An expectant look on his face, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t leave yet. Whip me a few more times.\u201dChu Huanzhao: \u201c?!?!?!\u201d\u201cAhem-hem-hem!\u201d Zu An himself felt that his words were simply too masochistic. He hurriedly rephrased, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I meant to say, let\u2019s make another wager.\u201dHe had noticed that his second formation was nearly filled up. How could he give up such a wonderful opportunity? Besides, there was a limit to how long the Ball of Delights\u2019 effect remained active. It would be a shame to let the remaining duration go to waste.\u201cWhat\u2019s the wager?\u201d Chu Huanzhao replied without thinking.Zu An said, \u201cSame as before. If I win, you are no longer allowed to quibble about me climbing into your bed last night. If I win, um\u2026 right. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll lick your shoes.\u201dAlthough he still didn\u2019t know much about this world, he was fairly certain that for a groom to climb into his sister-in-law\u2019s bed on his wedding night was probably an unforgivable offense. If the offended party was willing to forgive him, his life in the Chu clan would probably become better as well.Unexpectedly, Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face instantly turned scarlet. \u201cWhy are you so fixated on licking my shoes?! You pervert! I\u2019m gonna go tell my sister!\u201dZu An: \u201c\u2026..\u201d You were the one who came up with this perverted bet in the first place!\u201cFine! I accept your wager!\u201d An excited look once more appeared on Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face. She was just like any other gambler; she didn\u2019t understand how or why she had just lost, and she was determined to win the next round.\u201cThen please whip me!\u201d Zu An said in a heroic manner.Three lashes ensued. A lost, bewildered look was in Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes. The man was clearly collapsed on the ground and unable to stand up, but he hadn\u2019t let out a single sound. \u201cDoesn\u2019t\u2026 that hurt?\u201d\u201cOf course it hurts! But a real man never cries out in pain!\u201d Zu An could tell that half of his third formation had been filled up. He was so happy he could dance, but he didn\u2019t want to let her notice anything weird.Chu Huanzhao fell silent. This is the most courageous man I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. He\u2019s clearly pathetically weak, but he has such amazing willpower! She had encountered many mighty figures who were vastly stronger than Zu An, but none of them had been able to endure so much as two strikes from her whip.\u201cWould you like to make a third wager?\u201d Zu An tested.A weird look appeared on Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face. \u201cDo you\u2026 have some sort of special fetish?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Zu An immediately refuted. Oh hell no. I refuse to end up saddled with that type of reputation. \u201cI just want to make you lick my shoes.\u201d\u201cPatooey! In your dreams. No deal!\u201d Prior to all this happening, Chu Huanzhao would\u2019ve immediately agreed, as she didn\u2019t think the man stood a chance of winning. After having lost twice in a row though, she was feeling a bit antsy.Zu An was also quite sure that she probably wouldn\u2019t accept this wager, and so he changed the terms. \u201cThen if I win, whenever we run into each other in the future, you have to respectfully address me as \u2018brother-in-law\u2019. Deal?\u201dChu Huanzhao weighed the merits of this wager for a long moment. The man was her brother-in-law to begin with; even if she lost, it would be no big deal. She nodded. \u201cDeal!\u201dA new round of wagers had begun! After the first whip, Zu An was no longer able to keep his body from quivering, nor was he able to prevent himself from letting out a low moan. It wasn\u2019t a moan of pain; it was a moan of delight and satisfaction.\u201cI knew you were a pervert! I\u2019m done here!\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face was beet-red. She stomped her feet, then picked up Bootlicker\u2019s corpse and began to frantically flee.\u201cHey, what about the two remaining hits!\u201d Zu An called out frantically, but Chu Huanzhao disappeared into the night like a terrified little rabbit.Jeeze. She\u2019s no fun. Zu An grumbled to himself. Thankfully, the third formation was almost filled up by now. He struck out with a fist to test out his newfound strength. Right at this moment, a voice suddenly rang out by his side.\u201cYou actually reached the third step of the second rank? And almost at the peak of the third step, at that!\u201d A figure walked into the room. Naturally, this was Old Mi.Was he hiding nearby and watching this entire time?! Zu An felt a surge of anger, but he didn\u2019t reveal it. Instead he asked, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018third step of the second rank\u2019?\u201dOld Mi explained, \u201cPreviously, I explained the nine ranks to you. At the second rank, you temper your skin. Upon reaching the second rank, there are a total of nine small steps to each rank that must be reached before you ascend to the next rank. Kid, in just two short hours you actually managed to reach the third step of the second rank! That\u2019s odd. Ordinary people will need months or even years to draw enough ki into their bodies to reach the first rank, to say nothing of the second rank. You, a lower Ding class talent, actually managed to reach the third step of the second rank in mere hours. Although the secret manual is a marvelous thing, it shouldn\u2019t let you rise in power that quickly.\u201dZu An quickly understood. After he had absorbed the secret manual, the F2 button had carved all nine formations onto his skin. This had probably allowed him to skip the most difficult part of the process, drawing ki into the body for the first time. This had allowed him to start at the second rank, and after filling nearly three of the formations he had reached the third step of the second rank.He began wracking his brains trying to come up with an explanation. Cowardice was the way of kings, after all! He was still very weak. If he showed himself to be ridiculously talented, others might grow jealous of him and kill him. That wouldn\u2019t be very nice.But right at this moment, Old Mi began to mutter to himself. \u201cIt seems the Wailing Whip truly is a formidable weapon. On top of that, you fought back the pain, causing it to fill your body to an incredible degree. Combined with the special effects of this secret manual, you saw incredible gains as a result.\u201d For that matter, maybe I can try this in the future as well?Upon seeing Old Mi come up with an explanation on his own, Zu An no longer saw the need to dissemble. Just as he was about to ask what powers the third step of the second rank granted him, he suddenly felt a wave of pain crash onto him. He couldn\u2019t help but begin to howl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe suspicious look on Old Mi\u2019s face finally went away. \u201cI was wondering how you managed to endure the agony inflicted by the Wailing Whip. Clearly, you were using your tremendous willpower to resist it. Your presence of mind is quite admirable.\u201dZu An, however, was busy letting out mental curses at a torrid pace. Did I get a counterfeit Ball of Delights? Wasn\u2019t it supposed to grant pain immunity? What the hell is going on?!But he quickly realized what had happened. The Ball of Delights only lasted for an hour, and that hour had already gone past. Although it had given him immunity to the 10x pain the Wailing Whip had inflicted during that hour, the injuries left behind by the whip remained. Now that the pain-immunity effect was over, the normal pain generated by the wounds was no longer suppressed.Old Mi walked over to check his wounds. \u201cCount yourself lucky, kid. If that little girl hit you one more time, you would\u2019ve died.\u201d Old Mi sighed in amazement. \u201cYour body is unspeakably weak. I\u2019m amazed that you somehow managed to endure that many whips.\u201dOnly then did Zu An remember the other effect the Ball of Delights granted. It was something like, any \u2018lethal damage\u2019 inflicted by a woman with more money than you wouldn\u2019t reduce your health to below zero, right? Hey, doesn\u2019t that mean I now have a huge advantage whenever I fight against rich women?He mentally slapped himself. What are you thinking! What type of a man fights against women, anyhow? The problem was that the many restrictions on the usage of the Ball of Delights made it so that it really was impractical.Old Mi pulled out a bottle of medicine. With a wave of his sleeves, he caused the medicinal powder to alight on Zu An\u2019s wounds. \u201cTake these two bottles of medicine. One is to be applied externally, the other is to be ingested. Spend the next few days recuperating. Don\u2019t let yourself get killed.\u201dZu An could feel a cool, refreshing sensation cover his wounds. He instantly felt much better, and he said with heartfelt gratitude, \u201cElder, I really don\u2019t know how I should thank you.\u201dOld Mi let out two little chuckles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Soon, you\u2019ll know.\u201d He revealed a toothy old grin, then hunched over and left the room again.Zu An paid him no heed. He was completely focused on calculating his current gains. In total, he had farmed Chu Huanzhao for 1444 Rage points. That meant he could play the lottery 14 times! Just thinking about it made his impression of the little girl improve. She has the potential to be my ATM in the future.He had nothing to do besides just lie there on the bed. Hence, Zu An decided to begin playing the lottery. Thankfully, the keyboard could be controlled via his thoughts alone. Otherwise, he was so weak right now that he probably wouldn\u2019t even have had the strength to pick it up.He mentally \u2018clicked\u2019 on the lottery button, then began to eagerly watch as the light sparkled across the keyboard. What reward will I receive this time?What startled him was, this time the light only flickered across the numbers and the space bar; it didn\u2019t touch the letters at all. Only then did he remember that there was a note earlier about how only part of the rewards were currently available. The first three pulls were unlimited because they were given as part of a newbie package. He would probably have to unlock the letters in the future.Wait a sec. I also remember something about a \u2018greatly increased drop rate\u2019 for the first three pulls\u2026 but one of them was still a \u2018thanks for playing\u2019. Doesn\u2019t that mean the normal drop rate has to be\u2026Thanks for playing!Zu An frowned, but this was to be expected. He didn\u2019t worry too much, and spent another 100 Rage on another pull.Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!\u2026\u2026Eight pulls in a row! All of them were \u2018thanks for playing\u2019!I\u2019m going to fucking\u2026 Zu An was at the verge of smashing the keyboard to pieces. It was a pity that he couldn\u2019t farm Rage points from himself; otherwise, he probably would\u2019ve maxed out his meter.He wanted to go and first wash up before making another pull, but unfortunately he had been injured so heavily that he wasn\u2019t even able to move. How could he have the strength to get up?He had no idea that a pair of cold eyes were currently watching him from outside the window. If he did, he would definitely recognize that willowy frame as belonging to Chu Chuyan\u2019s personal maid, Snow.Has this man gone mad? A hint of confusion was in Snow\u2019s beautiful eyes as she watched Zu An\u2019s face twist and contort. The man was even feebly raising his hands and stamping his feet. She carefully considered the situation. When she noticed the bloody wounds left on his body, she was surprised: \u201cThe Wailing Whip?\u201dShe naturally recognized the tell-tale marks of the Second Miss\u2019 weapon. An extremely odd expression appeared on her face. \u201cI guess it\u2019d be better for him to die at her hands. If I acted personally, I would run the risk of exposing myself.\u201d She knew just how weak this useless son-in-law was; there was no way he could survive so many lashes from a Wailing Whip. He was almost certainly going to die on his bed.She turned and departed, returning to her own room. After ensuring that no one was around, she began to nibble some melon seeds while quickly scrawling a secret message on a piece of paper.\u201cRespected young master, rest assured; Miss Chu remains pure and unblemished. The two have not shared a room together. In addition, trust that I will get rid of Zu An as soon as possible. I expect you will hear some good news soon.\u201dAt first, she was about to also add in a note about Zu An\u2019s impotency, but she then hesitated and scrubbed that part out. She wasn\u2019t sure about how to account for it or what caused it, and she was also subconsciously unwilling to let her young master know that another man had touched her.She gritted her teeth in anger as she recalled how that bastard Zu An had touched almost every part of her body by the pool, and then gone even farther in Miss Chu\u2019s room. She hatefully bit down on a few seeds. Letting him die by the hands of the Second Miss is letting him off easy. I was planning to let him experience utter torment tonight.A memory swam up of Chu Chuyan instructing her earlier this evening to attend upon Zu An in bed. She bit her lips, then added another line to the message. \u201cAlso\u2026 I might be overly sensitive, but I have the feeling that Miss Chu is somewhat suspicious of me. Please do not dally in carrying out your mission, young master.\u201dAfter finishing the letter, she sealed it and then summon a beautiful little hawk. She attached the letter onto the hawk\u2019s foot. \u201cHurry up and deliver it to the young master.\u201dThe hawk seemed to possess human sentience. It spread its wings and then quickly flew off into the night.Back in Zu An\u2019s room. Zu An didn\u2019t know how narrowly he had just escaped assassination. All of his attention was focused on the lottery. Finally, on his tenth pull, the ball of light came to a halt on the \u20181\u2019 key instead of on the space bar. An image of a red bottle appeared on the virtual screen, as well as a line of text accompanying it.Faith in Brother Spring (S): In the unfathomably ancient cosmos, there has long been a famous saying \u2013 \u2018Have faith in Brother Spring, and you shall gain everlasting life!\u2019 This bottle will quickly replenish your health. So long as you are still alive, even the deadliest of wounds will be wiped away and you will regain all your health.\u201cFaith in Brother Spring?!\u201d These random Chinese internet memes caused Zu An to seriously consider the possibility that the creator of this keyboard came from Earth\u2026 but it didn\u2019t make sense. Although Earth was at a high level of technological development, it wasn\u2019t even close to being able to produce something like this keyboard.He withdrew the item, then hefted it in his hand. Judging from the looks of it, it was probably similar to the health potions in Earth video games. He decided to immediately quaff it, considering his current situation. He was worried that he was currently so weak that he might drop it. That would suck.Once the red liquid in the bottle entered his stomach, he could sense a warm sensation spread throughout his limbs and his bones. The terrifying wounds caused by the Wailing Whip were beginning to close at a visible rate, and even the scorched areas on his body caused by the earlier lightning bolt were healing and regenerating into fresh new skin.\u201cOh, wow. It\u2019s this effective?!\u201d Zu An instantly sat up, no longer feeling as though he was at the verge of expiring with each passing breath. His body was now completely normal, as though he hadn\u2019t been injured at all.This thing can be considered a miracle drug! If I had a supply of this, I\u2019d become virtually unkillable! Wait a second \u2013 \u2018Faith in Brother Spring (S)\u2019. What does the \u2018S\u2019 stand for? Zu An pondered this question. It probably meant \u2018small\u2019, which meant it had to be something akin to how healing potions worked in games, right?There was a limit to how much health a small potion could restore. If he levelled up in the future and had too much health, a single small potion might not be able to recover all his health. The problem was that the stupid explanation didn\u2019t give him any details as to what the upper maximum of a single bottle was.He rose to his feet and stretched. He could no longer sense any danger at all, and had recovered to the point where he was actually feeling a sense of strength and power in his limbs. This was most likely because he had reached the third step of the second rank.After carrying out a series of tests, he was fairly certain that his current strength was equivalent to that of four normal men combined. Remember, just before this his body was so weak, he couldn\u2019t even match up to an ordinary adult!However, Zu An still wasn\u2019t very satisfied. His current rank had not come easily, but he didn\u2019t feel that powerful. There was no difference between him and ordinary cultivators.Actually, the issue was that he didn\u2019t have enough knowledge regarding this world. This was a land where a person\u2019s status and authority was determined by his or her progress as a cultivator. The Emperor had the highest status and was also the strongest cultivator; the Emperor was an Earth Immortal! The headmasters of the various major sects and the patriarchs of major clans were usually at the Grandmaster stage, while the Kings, Princes, and Grand Marshals were generally of the Master stage. Ordinary Generals and the Nine Ministers were at the ninth rank, while most dukes and commandants, as well as some marquises, were at the eighth rank. City governors were usually at the seventh rank, and so-on and so-forth.The lowest-level officials such as village teachers and village tax collectors only needed to be at the second rank. The second rank was already more than enough to qualify them as officials of the imperial court and receive a commensurate salary, as well as cultivation resources. There were many people who would spend their entire lifetimes struggling and failing to reach this level. After all, only 10% of most would-be-cultivators would even make it to the first rank of harmonizing with the natural world. To reach the second rank would require expending an enormous amount of elementum. How could an ordinary person afford this?After spending some time getting used to his \u2018new\u2019 body, Zu An began to draw awards once again. This time, he didn\u2019t harbor any illusions of being able to pull anything nice. All he wanted was to pull something, even items that initially seemed completely useless like the Ball of Delights. It had taken him a thousand Rage points to pull a single bottle of health, and he only had four pulls left. He just hoped they wouldn\u2019t all be \u2018thanks for playing\u2019.For first three pulls, he got a \u2018thanks for playing\u2019. On the fourth pull, however, the ball of light finally came to a halt atop the \u20180\u2019 number. Stunned, Zu An hurriedly turned to stare at the screen, only to see a strange crimson pill appear at the center of it.Marrow Cleansing Pill: Why is it that you train so hard every day, yet your results are inferior to that of some young masters who just go through the motions? There is a famous saying \u2013 genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. However, that 1% inspiration is often more important than the 99% perspiration. After using this pill, you will be able to cleanse and refine your marrow, dramatically improving your body\u2019s overall quality and letting you train much faster.Zu An suddenly thought of what Chu Chuyan and Old Mi had said, that his body was extremely untalented for cultivation. With this pill in hand, I\u2019m sure to quickly rise up the ranks, get paid a higher salary, win the affections of beautiful women, and begin my trek up the highest heights of society!1. Li Yuchun, with \u2018chun\u2019 meaning spring, was a very popular Chinese singer some years back. Because she dressed in a tomboyish manner, many people nicknamed her \u2018Brother Spring\u2019. Her fanbase made a meme of photoshopping her pictures to make her look like Jesus, then captioned them with \u2018Have faith in Brother Spring, and you shall gain eternal life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest. He immediately wolfed down the pill, and he instantly sensed a cool sensation spread out from his mouth and surge into his head, his limbs, and his bones.Next, some black specks began to ooze out from his skin. This continued for a full hour before finally coming to a halt, at which point Zu An opened his eyes. He felt lighter, and the world itself seemed clearer before his gaze.Prior to this, his physical weakness caused him to continuously feel aches and pains in his backs. Now, he only felt as though his entire body was charged with energy. His hands and his feet no longer felt cold; instead, they felt warm and toasty, as though he had been filled with vitality.\u201cSo this thing really works?\u201d Zu An was delighted. Even though he didn\u2019t know how much his talent had improved by, the transformations within his body were easy to behold.I wish I started off with this thing. Despite his lower Ding classification, he had still been able to fill up nearly three of his formations after suffering seven strikes of the Wailing Whip. If he had taken this Marrow Cleansing Pill first? I probably would\u2019ve filled up five, right?A lower Ding class, according to the grading systems of Earth, probably would equate to a D- class, right? It really did suck.Only now did he notice all of the black goop covering his skin. He couldn\u2019t help but give it a sniff, and as he did a priceless expression appeared on his face. What a stench! He hurriedly ran off to give himself a bath.After finishing, he returned to his bed to prepare to go to sleep. He only had 44 Rage points left, so he was already plotting out his next scheme for farming his ATM for some more Rage and hopefully getting some nice things.His memories were slowly continuing to merge. The Chu clan held a dukedom within the empire, while Brightmoon City was their fiefdom. The Chu clan had a total of three children \u2013 the eldest daughter was Chuyan, the second daughter was Huanzhao, while their youngest (the son) was called Youzhao.As for the previous owner of this body, he was born an orphaned commoner who had been raised by his aunt and uncle. He was known throughout the region as a ne\u2019er-do-well; aside from being handsome, he had no redeeming qualities.Zu An still couldn\u2019t quite understand why such an awe-inspiring clan would draft such a useless son-in-law into the family. It\u2019s a trick. There has to be some sort of scheme behind this.However, considering that Zu An now had the activated keyboard as his trump card, he was much more confident in his future. He no longer felt as much fear as he had before. Ensconced in happy thoughts, he slowly drifted off into a pleasant slumber.Early the next morning. He was still half-asleep, but a loud ruckus suddenly woke up him. \u201cHurry up and rise! The Master and the Madame are waiting for you in the ancestral hall!\u201d\u201cShaddup\u2026 lemme sleep a bit more\u2026\u201d Zu An hadn\u2019t fully woken up yet. He had been exhausted last night and had went to bed very late. He turned over, preparing to go back to sleep.Suddenly, a basin of cold water was poured over him. With a squawk, he sat up straight, all his drowsiness gone.Opening his eyes, he saw several clan servants glowering at him. Next to them was a young warrior who was holding a copper basin in his hands, smirking straight at him.\u201cDid you throw the water on me?\u201d Zu An stared at the young warrior, more memories coming to the surface. The person in front of him was called Diao Yang and was a junior squad captain in the estate. In the past, Diao Yang had often caused him plenty of trouble.\u201cSo what if I did? Are you really starting to consider yourself one of the masters here? I have no idea what the young miss saw in you,\u201d Diao Yang smirked.Zu An immediately understood. Given how beautiful Chu Chuyan was, there were undoubtedly many people who lusted after her, like toads lusting after a swan. Most likely, Diao Yang was amongst their ranks. Although the difference in status between them guaranteed that he would never have a chance, that didn\u2019t mean he could easily countenance another toad getting her.Wait wait wait! I\u2019m not a toad, HE is the toad! His entire family consists of toads!Diao Yang noticed the mocking look in Zu An\u2019s eyes, which only further enflamed the captain. \u201cWhy are you staring at me? What, you wanna hit me? Go ahead and try!\u201d He actually stuck his face over. This useless son-in-law is even weaker than a woman. I could beat him up with both hands and one leg tied behind my back. In fact, in recent days he had beaten up the former Zu An quite a few times. The former Zu An was cowardly by nature, afraid to even complain when others bullied him. This was the reason why Diao Yang\u2019s behavior had become increasingly outrageous.But\u2026 this time, he miscalculated. This was no longer the same Zu An as before! All he saw was a black blur suddenly lash out and punch him right on the nose, followed by blood immediately beginning to spurt from it.Zu An retracted his arm, then shook his head. \u201cMan, what\u2019s going on with this world? Why does everyone keep asking me to hit them?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill you, you bastard!\u201d For a moment, Diao Yang\u2019s mind went completely blank. He never would\u2019ve imagined that this useless coward he looked down upon would actually dare to kill him. Blinded by rage, he actually drew his saber and prepared to chop down. Except\u2026 Wait a second, how did he suddenly become so strong?You have successfully trolled Diao Yang for +537 Rage!Right at this moment, a deep voice rang out: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201dAn enormous, mountain-shaped man walked into the room. The others immediately bowed respectfully and called out, \u201cGreetings, Captain!\u201dZu An seemed to recall that this was the chief captain of the guards for the Chu clan, Yue Shan. Right at this moment, Diao Yang hurriedly ran over and complained, \u201cCaptain, we came over to remind him to go to the ancestral hall, but not only did he refuse to get up, he even relied on his status to beat us up! Look at me! He broke my nose!\u201dZu An just calmly watched this performance. He\u2019s pretty good at putting on a show, and I\u2019m impressed by his ability to twist right and wrong.Yue Shan frowned. He glanced at Diao Yang\u2019s bleeding nose, then looked at the drenched Zu An and the copper basin on the ground. From these things, he was more-or-less able to tell what had happened here.\u201cEveryone is waiting in the ancestral hall, while all of you are here causing a ruckus? Go to the ancestral hall now! Everything else can wait.\u201d Yue Shan snorted. He really didn\u2019t give a damn about such petty matters.He also knew a bit regarding Diao Yang\u2019s personality and was fairly certain the man had deserved the punch. But of course, he didn\u2019t see the need to speak out on Zu An\u2019s behalf. He himself also looked down upon this cowardly son-in-law; there was no point in offending one of his colleagues for the sake of Zu An.Zu An\u2019s eyes spun in thought, and then he suddenly collapsed with a moan. \u201cUrgh! I\u2019m badly hurt. I can\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d\u201cYou are hurt?\u201d Yue Shan walked over to take a look. When he saw the lash marks on Zu An\u2019s body, the look on his face changed.Zu An secretly celebrated his own cleverness in deciding to go to sleep in those bloody clothes. \u201cYeah! Last night, Second Miss came to see me and then whipped me repeatedly with her Wailing Whip.\u201dThe looks on everyone\u2019s faces changed. Clearly, quite a few of them had tasted the deadly agony inflicted by Chu Huanzhao\u2019s whip.Only Diao Yang was unconvinced. \u201cNonsense! You had plenty of power when you socked me in the face. There\u2019s no way you are hurt.\u201dYue Shan said, \u201cEveryone in the ancestral hall is getting impatient. Let\u2019s head there first. As to exactly what happened, it\u2019ll all become clear soon enough. We\u2019ll pick him up and carry him to the ancestral hall.\u201dAfter instructing his subordinates to go find a stretcher, he then instructed Diao Yang to go see the doctor. Unexpectedly, Diao Yang absolutely refused to do so no matter what. He just applied a bandage to his nose while insisting that he was also going to go to the ancestral hall.When Yue Shan\u2019s back was turned, Diao Yang moved over and whispered by Zu An\u2019s ears, \u201cDon\u2019t get smug, brat. Soon, you\u2019ll no longer be a member of the Chu clan. Then, I\u2019ll let you know what the words \u2018a fate worse than death\u2019 means.\u201dZu An was rather puzzled. Why did this fellow seem so sure about this? Was it because he had crawled into Chu Huanzhao\u2019s bed on his wedding night? But judging from Chu Chuyan\u2019s reaction, the Chu clan didn\u2019t seem to care too much about it\u2026 and besides, I\u2019ve already \u2018suffered\u2019 her retaliation.Filled with suspicions, he let himself be carted into the ancestral hall. The ancestral hall was very large, and in the very center of the back hall was an enormous placard with the words, \u2018Hall of Admiration\u2019. Each word was carved deeply and firmly, and a solemn, majestic aura emanated from it.Below and to each side of the placard was a pair of enormous portrait paintings, each of which had some poems and couplets written to the side. Judging from their attire, these two were most likely important ancestors of the Chu clan. Beneath each portrait were incense, name-tablets, and various sacrificial devotions.There were two seats in front of the incense, and they were occupied by a middle-aged man and a middle-aged woman. The man was bearded, but his face shone like jade. He emanated the aura of a suave, gentle scholar.The noblewoman had arching eyebrows, eyes like autumn water, and hair tied up in a bun using a golden peacock hairpin. The peacock\u2019s plumes were spread wide open, making for a perfect whole with her bun. This all gave her an aura of luxurious poise.Zu An knew that these two had to be the current leaders of the Chu clan, Patriarch Chu Zhongtian and his wife Qin Wanru. When her gaze fell upon him, he instinctively felt a sensation of awe and dread. Clearly, his previous host was so utterly terrified of her that even now, some of the residual fear remained in the body.He suddenly noticed that quite a few of the men in the hall were sneaking glances in a certain direction. Only then did he see that Chu Chuyan was seated next to another young woman dressed in red clothes and a black skirt. This woman could be described with one word \u2013 \u2018charm\u2019. Her oval face shaped face looked as soft as butter, and her almond-shaped eyes seemed capable of speech. Every inch of her oozed an ineffable, alluring aura that was enough to fill any man who saw her with the most inappropriate of thoughts.Oh my! She\u2019s ginormous! Zu An\u2019s gaze fell upon her chest. No wonder everyone is staring at her!The woman seemed to feel his gaze, but she wasn\u2019t angered; instead, a hint of a smile appeared on her face. Her charming smile was extremely infectious, causing those who saw her to subconsciously feel kindly towards her.According to his memories, this woman was Chu Chuyan\u2019s dear friend, Pei Mianman. She was the young miss of the famous Pei clan of the imperial city. Recently, she had come to Brightmoon City for tourism, and had grown quite close to Chu Chuyan.There were others situated in the hall as well, but he didn\u2019t have enough time to make them all out. All he could tell was that some had grim looks on their faces, while others had delighted looks of schadenfreude.A hint of displeasure appeared on Lady Chu\u2019s face when she noticed how many people were sneaking glances at Pei Mianman\u2019s chest. She let out a gentle cough, seemingly startling the nearby Chu Zhongtian as well. The latter hurriedly said, \u201cZu An, do you know you have been brought here?\u201d\u201cSure. It\u2019s because I climbed into my sister-in-law\u2019s bed on my wedding night,\u201d Zu An replied.\u201cPffffft!\u201d A peal of suppressed laughter burst out. Pei Mianman covered her mouth, her face slightly reddened. Clearly, she didn\u2019t expect there to be such a shameless person in the world.Everyone else stared at Zu An with odd looks in their eyes. Not only had he done something completely shameless, he was even making them lose face before the Pei clan. What a wretch he was!Before Patriarch Chu had a chance to speak, Madame Chu instantly grew so enraged that she threw the teacup in her hand to the ground. \u201cMiscreant! Are you proud of yourself for having done something so vile?\u201d She had always doted fiercely on her two daughters. Now, one of them had been bullied, and the bully was speaking of it in what was clearly an uncaring manner!You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +254 Rage!The entire ancestral hall fell silent. Everyone in the Chu clan knew that while their patriarch was amiable and kind, their matriarch was an extremely irascible person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An replied calmly, \u201cI know that I deserve a thousand deaths for having carried out such a despicable, beastly deed. That\u2019s why, when the Second Miss came to speak to me last night, I decided I expiate my sins. I didn\u2019t resist at all as she struck me again and again with her Wailing Whip. I took a total of eight strikes before finally being forgiven by her.\u201dEveryone around secretly cursed him for his shamelessness. Didn\u2019t resist at all? Pagh! If the Second Miss really wanted to beat you up, how could you possibly resist or dodge even if you wanted to!Only then did Patriarch Chu and his wife notice the bloodstones covering Zu An and the stretcher he was on. Yue Shan immediately reported, \u201cLord Patriarch, the young master said that he had been injured so heavily by the Wailing Whip that he was unable to get out of bed on his own, so we carried him here.\u201d\u201cHuanzhao?\u201d Madame Chu was startled. But, considering her daughter\u2019s temperament, she found it believable. Rather irritated and embarrassed, she snapped, \u201cThis is ridiculous behavior!\u201dAn odd look flashed across Patriarch Chu\u2019s face as well. \u201cMadame, we summoned everyone today for the sake of what happened to Huanzhao. If she has already personally punished Zu An, perhaps we can let this matter come to a rest?\u201dHe thought back to the conversation he had yesterday with his daughter. He himself knew that there was something strange about this case, and Zu An probably was not to blame. However, given his wife\u2019s temper and the fact that the side branches were all instigating matters, he felt it was best to call this meeting and go through the motions.Upon hearing these words, Zu An instantly felt a sense of closeness to the man. It\u2019s almost impossible to find such a wonderful father-in-law!Before Madame Chu had a chance to respond, a screeching male voice rang out. \u201cBig brother, I must disagree. Our Chu clan has always prided ourselves on the strictness of our clan rules. We\u2019ve never had something so unsightly happen! If we simply handwave it away, the Chu clan will have lost all face! Do you know how many rumors are flying about these days? Everyone is saying that this brat has latched onto both sisters at once! If we do not punish him, it\u2019ll only fan the flames of these evil rumors even more!\u201dThe speaker was a grim-faced middle-aged man who was seated directly after Patriarch Chu. His most noticeable features were the heavy, dark bags under his eyes, and he was gently waving a fan when he spoke. According to Zu An\u2019s memories, this person was named Chu Tiesheng. He was a member of the second branch of the Chu clan, and Chu Chuyan addressed him as \u2018Second Uncle\u2019.\u201cSecond Uncle, what are you talking about?! It\u2019s not like he did anything to me last night!\u201d Right at this moment, a beautiful young woman suddenly ran inside from a back hall. She was dressed in fiery, skin-tight leathers, causing the formerly-icy hall to gain a hint of warm color.Patriarch Chu hurriedly said, \u201cHuanzhao, why did you come out? Go back inside immediately!\u201d\u201cStop yelling at her! You shouldn\u2019t yell at children like that!\u201d Madame Chu glared at her husband, then turned and instantly beamed at her daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Huanzhao. Don\u2019t listen to your father. Come and sit next to me. Tell Mother what this is all about.\u201dPatriarch Chu chuckled embarrassedly. The others present seemed completely unmoved; clearly, this happened so often that they were used to it by now.Chu Huanzhao used the whip in her hand to point at Zu An. \u201cMother! Last night, I really did use the Wailing Whip to beat him up. In the end, I did also agree to forgive what he did that night. I don\u2019t want to go back on my word!\u201dZu An mentally gave her a huge thumbs up. Although the little girl was more than a bit sadistic, at least she was an honest gambler.Right at this moment, an incredibly chubby man seated to the other side suddenly spoke out. \u201cNiece, you are still too young. You don\u2019t know the wicked ways of this world. Any of us could\u2019ve punished Zu An; you were the only one who shouldn\u2019t have! If word spreads, everyone will assume that something really did happen to you. You haven\u2019t even gotten married yet. Think about what this would do to your reputation!\u201dWhen the man spoke, he didn\u2019t have even a hint of a smile on his face\u2026 but there was so much fat jiggling on his face that it all creased together. It made everyone think that he was smiling at all times. As a result, he had a face that was hard to hate. He was currently playing with a glittering golden compass in his hands.Zu An recognized this \u2018smiling tiger\u2019 as the Third Uncle of the Chu clan, Chu Yuepo. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a headache. Why is it that everyone in the side branches all seem to want me dead? On the surface, I\u2019m nothing more than a useless son-in-law. How did I piss off so many people?Right at this moment, the young miss of the Pei clan, Pei Mianman, suddenly whispered a question to Chu Chuyan. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the Wailing Whip supposedly magnify all pain tenfold? Is he perhaps an expert who has been hiding his true abilities?\u201dAlthough her voice was soft, everyone present was still able to hear it. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but secretly curse at her. This woman has a sweet smile, but a devious heart. What a total bitch!Chu Chuyan frowned slightly. Snow, seated behind them, seized the chance to answer. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know martial arts. How can he be an expert?\u201dRight at this moment, second branch leader Chu Tiansheng\u2019s eyes lit up. He hurriedly said towards the Patriarch and Matriarch, \u201cBig brother, sister-in-law! Everyone here knows just how powerful the Wailing Whip is. I imagine even the two of you would find it hard to endure eight blows. How could an ordinary person like him do so?\u201dPatriarch Chu and Madame Chu exchanged a glance. Honestly, they didn\u2019t quite believe it either. The nearby Chu Huanzhao began to get angry. \u201cI really did hit him eight times! Or are you all accusing me of lying?!\u201d\u201cPatriarch, I\u2019m sure that Second Miss would never lie, but she\u2019s always been a kind and gentle person. Most likely, she showed mercy when she hit him and didn\u2019t use much force, and so Zu An wasn\u2019t injured as much as he claims to have been. Just now, he broke my nose! He packed quite a punch. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s hurt.\u201d At this moment, Diao Yang raised his voice. You had to pick the right time to kick a man when he\u2019s down, which was why he didn\u2019t say anything earlier.Odd looks appeared on the faces of everyone in the room. The Second Miss? Kind and gentle? How could you say such lies with a straight face? Since when did she ever show anyone mercy with that whip of hers?Still, everything which had happened thus far was quite ridiculous. She\u2026 didn\u2019t fall for her brother-in-law, did she?!Second branch leader Chu Tiansheng immediately seized this opportunity to interrupt. \u201cI think everything is now quite obvious. Not only did Zu An show no remorse for his detestable actions, he even manipulated our kind, naive Huanzhao in an attempt to escape blame for it. We should punish him in accordance with clan rules as a warning to any others!\u201dA pondering, fluctuating look was in Patriarch Chu\u2019s eyes. Clearly, he was weighing the pros and cons of this. Zu An secretly groaned. Just as he was about to speak up, a servant suddenly rushed in.\u201cLord Patriarch! Madame! A woman has come and is causing a huge fuss. She\u2019s insisting on seeing your son-in-law. Quite a few people have already gathered around!\u201d\u201cA woman?\u201d Madame Chu was stunned. \u201cA woman from which clan?\u201dChu Chuyan, who had remained calm this entire time, felt a hint of curiosity as well. Did Zu An know other women?!As for Zu An himself, a stupefied look was on his face. How many lovers did this guy have?! But why is it that I have no memories of any?Snow, who was standing behind Chu Chuyan, reacted with a hint of a smile. I didn\u2019t expect you to survive your injuries from last night. Thankfully, I made ample backup preparations.In response to the madame\u2019s questions, the servant nervously stuttered, \u201cF-from the Red Harmony Courtyard.\u201dInstantly, the hall was thrown into an uproar. Everyone knew what type of establishment the Red Harmony Courtyard was!\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace to let this nonsense continue outside our estate. Bring her inside!\u201d Madame Chu ordered coldly, a hint of uncontrollable rage in her voice.Soon, a gaudily made-up and dressed woman sashed and swayed her way inside. When she spied the distant Zu An, she immediately threw herself at him and began to sob and wail. \u201cYou heartless man! After you had your fill, you told me that you were broke and couldn\u2019t pay me, but you said that you would quickly come back and bring me into your household as a concubine. You even told me that I could become sisters with the young misses of the Chu clan. That was the only reason I agreed to everything. How could you just abandon me?!\u201dSnow idly toyed with her ponytail while watching this, her eyes narrowed to crescent slits. Let\u2019s see you make it out of this alive.This was a case where no one save the two people involved could know the truth of it. Even if you denied it, no one will believe you unless you make public the fact that you are impotent\u2026 but once that happens, that would be even more embarrassing for the clan. No matter what, you\u2019ll no longer be the son-in-law after today.Young master, your dreams will quickly become a reality.The hall once more fell into a strange silence. The members of the second branch and the third branch no longer spoke, because by now there was no need for them to say anything.Even Patriarch Chu Zhongtian, who had been obliquely speaking up for Zu An this entire time, was now furious. A common whore was now talking about wanting to become \u2018sisters\u2019 with his precious daughter? This was an absolute disgrace\u2026 and it was all because of Zu An!\u201cVile miscreant! What do you have to say for yourself?!\u201d Madame Chu glared at Zu An, her eyes spitting fire.You have successfully trolled Chu Zhongtian for +78 Rage!You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +300 Rage!Zu An himself was puzzled as to how the previous \u2018him\u2019 had managed to survive for so long. He had transmigrated to this world just a day ago, but everyone seemed to want him dead! So, who hired this prostitute to deal with me? The second branch? The third? Maybe Miss Pei? Looks like being a wife-moocher isn\u2019t going to be that easy.He turned to face the gaudily-dressed woman in a calm, unhurried manner. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name again?\u201d\u201cOh, you heartless man! Don\u2019t even think about pretending not to know me. You called out my name \u2018Springflower\u2019 with such passion so many times, but now you\u2019ve forgotten it?\u201d the prostitute said with a cold smile.Zu An didn\u2019t argue with her. Instead, he said with a smile, \u201cAh. Pray forgive me, sweet Springflower, I\u2019ve been busy recently and it slipped my mind. Oh, right \u2013 how much do I owe you in hooker fees?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018hooker fees\u2019?! You don\u2019t have to put it so unpleasantly.\u201d Springflower waved her fingers \u2018coquettishly\u2019. \u201cWe were together for nearly half a month. All combined, it would be about twenty\u2026 no, thirty silvers.\u201dWhen she said this, everyone present felt even more disdain towards Zu An. You were actually interested in this sort of low-rate hooker? How thirsty were you?\u201cThirty silvers?\u201d Zu An nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cheap. How about this? I\u2019ll give you three hundred silvers, and we\u2019ll consider the extra part as our betrothal gift.\u201dThe second branch and third branch clansmen sucked in icy cold breaths of shock. Was this fellow suicidal? They hurriedly turned to look towards Chu Zhongtian, only to see that the Patriarch and the Madame\u2019s face were all ashen as well.Miss Pei was watching Zu An with a look of curiosity on her face. For some reason, she had the feeling that this fellow was a bit odd.\u201cTruly?\u201d A look of joy appeared on Springflower\u2019s face.\u201cOf course!\u201d Zu An immediately turned to look at Chu Chuyan, \u201cSweetheart, I don\u2019t have any money on me right now. Can you loan me three hundred silvers?\u201dEveryone in the hall stared at him as though he was insane. You are actually asking your wife to pay for your whoring fees?! What the hell is wrong with you! Chu Chuyan is probably going to rip him apart on the spot!But, contrary to everyone\u2019s expectations, Chu Yuyan actually nodded. \u201cVery well. Servants, go bring me three hundred silvers.\u201dNow, everyone was thrown into a state of confused chaos. No one could understand what was going on. Even Pei Mianman stared at her with a look of astonishment. Was this truly her best friend?Madame Chu was about to explode, but the nearby Patriarch Chu suddenly gave her a gentle nudge on the arms, then pursed his lips towards their daughter. Madame Chu couldn\u2019t help but frown. In the end, she decided to be silent for now and watch.Zu An mentally praised Chu Chuyan with a big thumbs up. My freebie wife really is as cold as ice and twice as clever. She was probably the only one who knew for sure that he was being maligned, as she had personally witnessed his impotency at work. There was no way she would believe he had been out whoring.Wait. Why do I suddenly feel like I want to start crying uncontrollably?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He might as well reveal his shortcomings to clear his name, but fortunately it wasn\u2019t necessary. Yet.Zu An gathered his thoughts, then said to Springflower, \u201cTake your relocation expenses. Honestly, you came at just the right time. The last person I took home is about to break down in the military camp. You\u2019ll be able to replace her there.\u201d\u201cRelocation expenses?\u201d Springflower finally started to smell something fishy. \u201cWait a second. Why is she in the military camp?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Zu An put on a look of mild bemusement. \u201cMy wife is perfect in every aspect. Her only failing is that she dotes on me too much and gets a teensy bit jealous. The last time I brought in someone like you, she found a random excuse to send the woman to our military camp to service our soldiers. Maaan. She has to be a blushing bride multiple times a day. I feel bad for her.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +433 Rage!Chu Chuyan never would\u2019ve imagined that he would paint such a portrait of her. Upon seeing the weird looks everyone was giving her, for the first time she wanted to kill Zu An as well. However, she knew that the events of the past two days were simply too strange, and he did fulfill all of her criteria. If she had to find another groom, their clan would once more become embroiled in all sorts of intrigue.And so, she simply sat there with a stony look on her face, not saying a word.\u201cMILITARY CAMP?!\u201d A look of horror appeared on Springflower\u2019s face. Even for people in her profession, there was a social hierarchy. The highest-level prostitutes were the \u2018queen of flowers\u2019, next came the ordinary courtesans, and third was cheaper brothel prostitutes like herself. At the very, very bottom rung, however, were the army whores, most of whom had been assigned this punishment for some infraction.All the men in the military were thirsty, yet had incredible endurance. There weren\u2019t many women who could endure this sort of treatment, and so it took at most half a year for them to be utterly wrecked. When she thought of the terrifying gossip stories she had heard in the prostitute circle\u2026 her face instantly turned ashen white.Zu An nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though. These are members of our private army. They\u2019ll take good care of you! They\u2019ve been looking forward to someone fresh.\u201dMadame Chu was no longer able to contain her rage. \u201cMiscreant, the Chu clan\u2026\u201dShe was about to say that the Chu clan and its army never took part in such shameful deeds, but Springflower had already mentally collapsed. The latter let out a shrill scream and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to an army base! Everything I said just now was a lie! I don\u2019t even know you!\u201dAs she spoke, she began pushing and pulling at the nearby Diao Yang. \u201cDiao Yang, the situation is completely different from what you described to me! SAY SOMETHING! I don\u2019t want to go to the army base!\u201dDiao Yang\u2019s face turned pale, and he hurriedly kicked her aside. \u201cDon\u2019t try to slander me, you crazy bitch! The Chu clan\u2019s forces are under strict moral supervision. How could we possibly\u2026\u201dHe wanted to continue, but suddenly an enormous burst of power surrounded him and prevented him from saying another word.Patriarch Chu\u2019s face was as placid as water. He looked at Springflower. \u201cSo he asked you to come here and say what you just said?\u201dSpringflower nodded frantically, like a chicken pecking at rice. \u201cHe found me and gave me twenty silvers, then said that I\u2019d earn even more after visiting the estate. Since this is a Duke\u2019s estate and everyone in here is a noble, I was sure that if I helped out then I\u2019d earn enough for a lifetime. That\u2019s why I snuck in! Please forgive me, Lord Patriarch!\u201dOnly then did Patriarch Chu release his energy hold on Diao Yang. \u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201dDiao Yang\u2019s face was ashen. He hurriedly knelt down to beg for mercy. \u201cPlease forgive me, Master! I was instructed to do this.\u201d\u201cInstructed by who?\u201d Patriarch Chu barked.\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Diao Yang swallowed hard, then hurriedly continued, \u201cThat person spoke to me from the other side of the wall. He gave me a bribe to do it! I\u2019ve always hated the fact that our young miss ended up marrying someone so useless, so like a fool I agreed. Please show me mercy on behalf of my many years of service, Master!\u201dUpon hearing his words, Snow finally relaxed her formerly-tight grip on her ponytail.Patriarch Chu snorted, then waved for him to be removed. He glanced at everyone present with a thunder-like gaze. \u201cSince the situation has been clarified, it is easy to see that Zu An was maligned. Considering that he has already suffered punishment, this matter is at an end. No one is to speak of it in the future. Any objections?\u201dChu Tiesheng gently fanned himself, while Chu Yuepo continued to toy with his compass. Neither spoke. Given that right now they had yet to discover the mastermind behind all this, none of them were willing to risk jumping out and attract scrutiny upon themselves.Zu An let out a long sigh of relief. Finally, its over. However, Madame Chu was still angry. \u201cAre we going to spare him, just like this?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Patriarch Chu immediately smiled ingratiatingly. \u201cZu An has gotten himself involved in all sorts of unsightly affairs. To ensure he doesn\u2019t cause trouble in the future, after he\u2019s recovered from his injuries we\u2019ll punish him by sending him to the Brightmoon Academy to cultiv-\u2026\u201d He wanted to say cultivate, but when he remembered how poor Zu An\u2019s physique was he immediately changed his words. \u201cAhem, to become a man of learning. That way, he\u2019ll at least be able to assist the clan as an accountant or something.\u201d\u201cBrightmoon Academy?\u201d Zu An was rather stunned. But, considering that Patriarch Chu was the Duke of Brightmoon City, the Brightmoon Academy was most likely affiliated to their clan.His main focus right now was on the Rage points he had accumulated. From start to finish, he had accumulated 1646 more Rage points. Time to play the lottery again!After he was carried back to his room, a red shadow suddenly barged inside just as he was about to begin drawing his prizes.A wary look appeared on his face when he saw it was the Second Miss of the Chu clan. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Did she figure out that my wounds are all feigned?Chu Huanzhao immediately hopped onto the nearby table, then sat down, letting her slender little legs dangle in midair. \u201cI came here to apologize to you.\u201d\u201cApologize?\u201d For a second, Zu An didn\u2019t know how to respond.A rather uncomfortable look appeared on Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face. \u201cPer our wager, I agreed to forget about what happened that night. But, I wasn\u2019t able to protect you today. You even ended up being punished for it.\u201dZu An was amused. This little girl has an honest side to her. He was in a rush to play the lottery, so he didn\u2019t have any interest in wasting time with her. He just casually waved his hand. \u201cOh, whatever. You\u2019re a kid. It\u2019s only normal that you don\u2019t have much say in the family.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +66 Rage!Zu An blinked. Only now did he realize that a rather ugly look was on Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face. She let out a snort, then hopped off the table. Before leaving, she said, \u201cIn the future, I\u2019ll protect you when you are at the academy. If anyone tries to bully you, just tell\u2019m you are under my care!\u201dZu An rolled his eyes behind her back. You\u2019re just a little slip of a girl, but you act like you are the boss woman in charge or something. Besides, he himself was the son-in-law of the estate. After what happened today, no one in the family would dare to bully him for a time.He cast that all aside for now. After scanning the area and ensuring that no one else was coming, he immediately hopped out of bed. He solemnly washed his hands and his face, then actually pulled out a joss of incense. He lit the incense, then said a prayer: \u201cBuddha, Brahma, Jehova, Allah\u2026 any gods that exist, please protect me and ensure I get a nice pull.\u201dFactoring in the 66 Rage he had just earned from Chu Huanzhao, he now had a total of 1712 Rage points. He summoned the keyboard, selected the \u2018Lottery\u2019 button, then carefully pressed \u2018Enter\u2019. Light once again began to quickly flash across the numbers on the keyboard.Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!\u2026 Oh come ON! Zu An was beyond irritated. Do I have the worst luck in the world, or are the drop rates really that low?It wasn\u2019t until his thirteenth pull that the light finally escaped from the space bar and instead landed on the number \u20188\u2019. He looked up excitedly. This was a new key; he wondered what it would grant!A small bottle suddenly appeared before his eyes, filled with some sort of green crystalline liquid. Below as the explanation.Poison Bottle: This is a thrown weapon. It is capable of causing everyone within a small area to feel numb and powerless. It ignores all defenses for targets below the fifth rank.This time, Zu An truly was delighted. In any game and any world, defense-bypassing skills and techniques were always overpowered as hell. His only regret was that it only worked against targets below the fifth rank, but for now he probably wouldn\u2019t be so unlucky as to encounter bosses at or above the fifth rank, right?Aww, hell, I hope I\u2019m not foreshadowing myself.Now he had yet another trump card up his sleeve. Zu An happily stored the little green bottle into his item bar. His only complaint was that its coloration seemed a bit unlucky. He pulled four more times, but as expected, the only result was \u2018thanks for playing\u2019. What a crappy pull rate this thing has.Still, Zu An was quite happy that it was apparently quite easy for him to earn Rage. The one drawback was the byproduct of earning rage was that he would definitely become hated by everyone. This is a cultivator world. I hope I don\u2019t end up getting offed by a random boss. Mm. I need to pick my targets carefully in the future!Man, I really wish I was like one of those endgame MC\u2019s who can wipe out entire worlds with a thought. I guess all I can do is keep a lower profile and slowly grind my way up for now.Suddenly, new messages began to pop up.You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +2 Rage!+2 Rage! +2 Rage! +2 +2 +2 +2 +2...A series of flashing messages appeared, causing Zu An to feel a bit stunned. What\u2019s going on with that freebie mother-in-law of mine? How did I piss her off this time?!***In another part of the Chu Estate, within Patriarch Chu Zhongtian and his wife Qin Wanru\u2019s private quarters. Qin Wanru was still feeling rather angry. \u201cThat bastard really pisses me off! My poor, sweet Yan\u2019er. Her future marital prospects have now come to an end at that fellow\u2019s hands.\u201dPatriarch Chu hurriedly poured a cup of tea and brought it to his wife. \u201cThis was Chuyan\u2019s personal decision.\u201dQin Wanru drank the tea in one gulp, still feeling angry. \u201cIt was all for the sake of your Chu clan!\u201dPatriarch Chu smiled awkwardly, then hurriedly changed the subject. \u201cHonestly, right now I\u2019m more concerned about who, exactly, is secretly targeting Zu An.\u201dNow that they were talking about serious business, Qin Wanru frowned as well. \u201cAgreed. Before this, I didn\u2019t fully believe your suspicions, but the events in the ancestral hall this morning do seem to suggest that someone is secretly targeting him.\u201dPatriarch Chu nodded. \u201cAnd why would he, on his wedding night, suddenly run off into Huanzhao\u2019s bed? He might be a little bit of a miscreant at times, but I really don\u2019t think he\u2019s that bold.\u201dQin Wanru snorted grumpily. \u201cHe seemed quite bold this morning, didn\u2019t he?\u201dPatriarch Chu said, \u201cAnd that night, someone knocked Huanzhao out. That\u2019s the only explanation; otherwise, there\u2019s no way she would\u2019ve let him get into his bed. You don\u2019t honestly think he\u2019s capable of that, do you?\u201d\u201cHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t be half as pissed off as I am right now if he did have that level of talent,\u201d Qin Wanru said angrily. Clearly, she was exceedingly disgruntled by how useless her new son-in-law was.Patriarch Chu sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s something I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell you yet. That same night, our spirit creek was defiled.\u201d\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Qin Wanru shot up, thunderstruck. Ever since the Chu clan was established, it relied on two primary sources of revenue. The first was the salt trade, while the second was the arms trade. The reason why the Chu clan was so dominant in the arms trade was partially due to their marvelous runic formations, but also because they had a spirit creek which could be used to cleanse and temper weapons. This was why the arms they produced were of a significantly higher quality than those of their competitors.Every clan had their own runes and formations, after all, and some of them were on par with the Chu clan\u2019s. The spirit creek, however, was exclusive to the Chu clan. It could easily be described as the critical component to the clan\u2019s success in the arms industry.\u201cYou were so furious at what Zu An did that night that I was afraid to tell you.\u201d Patriarch Chu kept a careful eye on his wife\u2019s facial expressions as he continued. \u201cRight now, I suspect that on his wedding night, someone drugged him and put him into Huanzhao\u2019s bed. While almost everyone was distracted by this, they seized the chance to secretly send people to defile our spirit creek.\u201dQin Wanru said frantically, \u201cCan the spirit creek be restored?\u201dPatriarch Chu shook his head. \u201cThat person dripped \u2018demonspit\u2019 into the spirit creek. It\u2019ll remain defiled for at least twenty years. Thankfully, that person didn\u2019t have a large supply of demonspit; perhaps in a few more decades, the spirit creek will slowly manage to cleanse itself.\u201cWho knows if the Chu clan will even be around in a few more decades!\u201d Qin Wanru knew that demonspit was the vilest and most toxic substance in this world. If their spirit creek had been polluted by demonspit, then there really was no way to save it for now. \u201cWho do you think carried this out? The Emperor\u2019s faction, or King Qi\u2019s faction?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Zhongtian fell silent upon hearing his wife\u2019s words. The founder of the Zhou Dynasty, Emperor Taizu, lost his sons to the war that founded the empire, so Taizu\u2019s younger brother offered his second son\u2014also the current King Qi\u2014to Taizu for adoption.However, in a bitter fight against an expert of the foreign tribes, Taizu sacrificed his life to bring the enemy down together with him. Due to the young age of Taizu\u2019s adopted son, as well as the instability within the newly formed empire, Taizu nominated his younger brother as the successor to the throne in his dying breath, leading to the rise of Emperor Taizong.Inheriting the will of Taizu, Emperor Taizong conquered vast swathes of land, greatly expanding the territories of the Zhou Dynasty. In the midst of doing so, he accumulated far too many physical traumas on the battlefield, resulting in his body reaching its limit prematurely. When the time came for him to select an heir, he found himself being put in a spot.Going by conventions, the throne belonged to Taizu\u2019s lineage, and he only took the crown because King Qi was far too young to govern back then. Thus, it was only right for him to pass the throne down to the already matured King Qi.But greed lurked in the hearts of all men. Even though King Qi shared Taizong\u2019s blood, he was already the son of another man, having been adopted by Taizu. Due to that, Taizong favored his own eldest son, King Jin, instead.So, he played a nifty trick. He issued an edict, declaring that he would proclaim the first one amongst the two to reach Earth Immortal stage as the successor to the throne.King Jin, as the eldest son of Taizong, was naturally older than King Qi, and the fact that he had the backing of Taizong meant that he had far more cultivation resources at his disposal. It went without saying that King Jin would be the first one to reach Earth Immortal stage, and he went on to succeed the throne and became the incumbent Emperor Gaozong.It caused controversy back then as there were many older subjects in the imperial court who were loyal to Taizu\u2019s lineage, and those people stood in support of King Qi. In order to placate this group of people, Taizong hinted at the possibility of having King Qi succeed Gaozong after the latter\u2019s death, thus averting a possible mutiny.A hundred years had passed since then, and Gaozong was nearing the end of his lifespan. The issue of succession came up once more, and Gaozong chose to proclaim his own son as the crown prince. Such an act provoked the discontentment of those from King Qi\u2019s faction. The fact that the selected crown prince was of average talent, paling far in comparison to the prodigious King Qi, only served to further inflame the hearts of the court officials, swaying them so.But no matter what, Gaozong was still someone who had ruled for a hundred years, consolidating great power and influence under him during his reign. In recent years, these two factions had been clashing with one another, both in the open and in the shadows.The Chu clan, with its businesses dominating both the salt trade and the arms trade, had unbelievable wealth that rivaled that of a country. Given the significant resources it had at its disposal, it was inevitable that both factions would want to bring the Chu clan to their side. However, Chu Zhongtian had no wish to embroil the Chu clan in the fight to determine the succession of the throne, so he had been trying to maintain a neutral stance thus far. In recent days, however, the Imperial faction seemed to be showing intentions of pushing for a marriage with the Chu clan so as to drag it onto their war chariot.Patriarch Chu and his wife had been deeply troubled over this matter because the Chu clan, unlike other clans, had a huge secret that mustn\u2019t be known by outsiders. Furthermore, Chu Chuyan had been the one supporting half of the Chu clan\u2019s businesses over the years. If she were to be married into the Imperial faction, the Chu clan would be in dire risk of being swallowed whole.Chu Chuyan was aware of the things at stake here, so she proposed taking the initiative to hold an open selection for her spouse. She chose the most useless fellow in the city and quickly held a marriage ceremony with him in order to crush any ideas that the Imperial faction or King Qi\u2019s faction had in mind.It was due to this that Qin Wanru suspected the culprit who ruined the spirit creek was sent by either the emperor or King Qi.\u201cRegardless of who the culprit is, it looks like the days ahead of us aren\u2019t looking too good,\u201d Patriarch Chu said gravely. \u201cSang Hong is going to take over as the governor of Linchuan Commandery.\u201dAnd Brightmoon City was under the jurisdiction of Linchuan Commandery.Qin Wanru exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cVice Minister of Finance, Sang Hong!\u201dThe Minister of Finance was one of the Nine Ministers that managed the finances of the empire, and the Vice Minister of Finance was the second-in-charge. Sang Hong, who was in charge of supervising the salt and arms trade within the country, was an aide to the emperor, so it was clear he was being assigned to the Linchuan Commandery in order to deal with the Chu clan.\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that he\u2019s a callous person who has no qualms killing his kin if he needs to. There are many noble clans who have fallen apart due to his intervention. I fear that our Chu clan is in grave danger,\u201d Qin Wanru remarked worriedly.Seeing the traces of fear on the face of his usually headstrong wife, Chu Zhongtian pulled her into his embrace and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it accordingly when it comes our way. Our Chu clan is no pushover either! Sang Hong is no more than an eighth rank; let\u2019s see who gets the last laugh!\u201dQin Wanru rolled her eyes at her husband. \u201cIs his cultivation the only thing that matters? Great Bandit Chen Xuan of the Hidden Dragon Mountain is no more than a sixth rank, so why haven\u2019t you managed to eradicate him yet even after so many years?\u201dChu Zhongtian harrumphed coldly. \u201cThat Chen Xuan is a sly fellow. Every time I rush over after receiving the news, he would have already disappeared without a trace. I\u2019m suspecting that he might have an insider within this city that has been tipping him off, or else I would have caught him long ago!\u201dA thought popped into Qin Wanru\u2019s mind, and she said, \u201cThose bunch of bandits illegally peddle salt and plunder the merchants passing by the area, killing them in cold blood. We should toss the matter into Sang Hong\u2019s hands. He won\u2019t be able to turn a blind eye to this matter as the governor.\u201dChu Zhongtian\u2019s eyes lit up as well. \u201cWhat a wonderful idea! That reminds me, I heard that the merchant convoy of the Yu clan is heading over to Brightmoon City. We have to inform them of this matter lest they get ambushed by Chen Xuan\u2019s group\u2026 Yowch ouch ouch ouch\u2026\u201dBefore Chu Zhongtian could finish his words, Qin Wanru had already grabbed his ear tightly, saying, \u201cYou are just worried about their matriarch, Yu Yanluo, aren\u2019t you? She was the number one beauty of the capital back then. I know that you shamelessly courted her before, only for her to end up marrying the Cloudmidst Duke. Are you thinking of rekindling the spark between you two?\u201dChu Zhongtian desperately pleaded for mercy, \u201cMy dear wife, they have already been married for so long. How could I possibly bear such intention toward her? You mustn\u2019t spout such nonsense!\u201dHowever, Qin Wanru still refused to release her grip, harrumphing coldly instead. \u201cI heard that the Cloudmidst Duke has passed away due to an accident recently though. Doesn\u2019t that mean that Yu Yanluo is single?\u201dChu Zhongtian\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cIs that true?\u201dIn the next instant, he felt two murderous gazes directed toward him from his sides, so he quickly changed his tone and said, \u201cMy dear wife, doesn\u2019t the fact that I\u2019m ignorant about her affairs show that my eyes have never been on her? Besides, you also know the current circumstances I am in. How could I have any other intention about her?\u201dSeeing the dimmed look on Chu Zhongtian\u2019s face, Qin Wanru hurriedly released his ear. \u201cHusband, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dChu Zhongtian shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m the one who has let you down.\u201dQin Wanru hated to see the downcast look of her husband, so she quickly changed the subject. \u201cWhere did Chuyan go?\u201dChu Zhongtian replied, \u201cShe\u2019s bringing the young miss of the Pei clan around the city.\u201dA frown formed on Qin Wanru\u2019s forehead. \u201cAs someone from the Pei clan, she\u2019s probably a member of King Qi\u2019s faction. I can\u2019t help but think that she has darker intentions in mind for suddenly choosing to study at Brightmoon Academy.\u201dChu Zhongtian chuckled in response, \u201cRest assured! Our daughter is a smart child, she knows what to do.\u201dQin Wanru harrumphed. \u201cPei Mianman might be young, but she has the face of a cunning vixen. Those peach blossom eyes of hers seem to be constantly seducing the men around her. I don\u2019t like her.\u201dChu Zhongtian burst into laughter. \u201cAre you worried that she would snatch your daughter\u2019s man?\u201dRecalling Zu An\u2019s loser face, it was truly hard for Qin Wanru to imagine that Pei Mianman would actually fall for him. She chuckled to herself and remarked, \u201cI would be celebrating if she could take that scoundrel away from Chuyan!\u201dAchoo~Zu An suddenly let loose a powerful sneeze. He wondered which young miss or madame was currently thinking of him.\u201cYoung master, have you caught a cold? I\u2019ll find some thicker clothes for you to put on right away!\u201d A loud exclamation suddenly sounded. Before Zu An could even react, a young man had already wrapped a robe around him.The stupefied Zu An took a closer look at the young man before him. The latter appeared to be fourteen or fifteen years of age, and he was dressed in a set of blue clothes. His hair was tied into two buns on top of his head. Put together with his large eyes, he had a docile, youthful look.\u201cNo, wait a moment, who are you?\u201d\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re teasing me. This servant is your study companion!\u201d the young man replied with a flirtatious smile.\u201cStudy companion?\u201d Zu An was flabbergasted for a moment before realizing that this might have something to do with him attending the Brightmoon Academy. He was just heading to one of their clan\u2019s subsidiaries. Was there really a need to go so far as to assign a study companion for him?Looks like the Brightmoon Duke\u2019s estate is indeed needlessly rich. Yeap, just how I like it.\u201cWhat did you call me earlier?\u201d\u201cYoung master?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hear you. Louder!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cNot bad, not bad. Lad, you have a bright future ahead of you.\u201dIt was as if the flower of joy had blossomed on Zu An\u2019s face. Nothing seemed to have gone his way ever since he came over to this world. He might be the son-in-law of a Duke\u2019s estate, but there was not a single person who respected him here, let alone address him as \u2018young master\u2019.It wasn\u2019t easy for him to come by someone who treated him with respect, and it left him feeling soothed from head to toe.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dThe study companion immediately jolted into attention as he replied anxiously, \u201cYoung master, my name is Cheng Shouping.\u201d\u201cWhat ping?\u201d Zu An thought that study companions usually had characters like Fu (Fortune), Wang (Prosperity), or Cai (Money) in their names. At the very least, they would go with something that was easy to remember like Wah On. Who in the world gave this fellow such a weird name?\u201cCheng Shouping, Shouping from \u2018guarding one\u2019s lips like a tightly corked bottle\u2019. It\u2019s a name that the old master bestowed me!\u201d As the young man spoke, he puffed up his chest proudly.\u201cNot bad, you were actually able to receive a bestowed name from the old master.\u201d Zu An wasn\u2019t familiar with the customs in this world, but he reckoned that it should be a huge honor to be given a name by one\u2019s master. Take Zheng Chenggong from his previous world for example, after he was bestowed a surname from the emperor, everyone began addressing him by the honorific \u2018Lord of Imperial Surname\u2019.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re flattering me. I was deeply favored by the old master while I was working for him, but one day, I found myself transferred over to the kitchen. Initially, I thought that I might have unintentionally offended the old master somehow, but now that I have been assigned as young master\u2019s study companion, I finally understand the thought that the old master has put into me. He must have been trying to temper me by putting me through adversities so that I would be ready to take on a greater cause when the need arises!\u201d Light could be seen glittering in Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes as he spoke with great passion.\u201cWait a moment\u2026\u201d Somehow, the more Zu An listened to Cheng Shouping\u2019s story, the more bizarre it seemed to become. He was well aware of how others in the Chu Estate thought of him, and yet, this fellow thought that it was an honorable job?Looks like he\u2019s not a very bright lad.Besides, this fellow had started out working by Old Master Chu\u2019s side, so how did he end up being transferred over to a place like the kitchen?However, Zu An didn\u2019t pay too much heed to this matter. He was more interested in his own affairs. \u201cIt seems like you have been in the Chu Estate for quite some time. You should know quite some stuff, right?\u201dCheng Shouping thumped his chest and said, \u201cThat goes without saying! From the old master down to the servants working in the Chu Estate, there\u2019s no one\u2019s affair whom I don\u2019t know about!\u201dZu An was planning to gather some intelligence surrounding the Chu Estate. It had only been here for two days since he arrived here, but there were already so many people who were plotting his death. To make things worse, he had no idea where the problem was stemming from at all. This made him deeply aware that he was in a perilous position.He mulled for a moment before asking, \u201cDo you know why the Chu clan chose me as their son-in-law?\u201d This was the one thing that he had been the most doubtful about. Chu Chuyan, from her background down to her appearance, was impeccable, whereas Zu An, no matter which angle one were to look at him from, was useless trash through and through. It should have been impossible for their paths to have ever crossed, but in a mysterious turn of events, they actually became married to one another. This reeked of something suspicious.After hearing Zu An\u2019s question, Cheng Shouping shot a confused look at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that because of young master\u2019s devastatingly handsome looks?\u201dZu An\u2019s eyes shot right open. It would seem that Chen Shouping shared some of his flair in spewing nonsense earnestly. \u201cCough cough. While what you\u2019re saying makes perfect sense, is there no other reason behind it?\u201d\u201cNone at all. The young miss chose you because of your dashing looks back then.\u201dDeep in Chen Shouping\u2019s heart, he was thinking \u2018Don\u2019t you have a shred of self-awareness in you at all? There\u2019s nothing you have that can be called a strength other than that!\u2019, but he didn\u2019t allow a sliver of his thoughts to slip through his mask. His expression was as earnest as it could get.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that the young miss chose me personally?\u201d Zu An astutely picked out the crucial information hidden amidst Chen Shouping\u2019s words.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Madame wasn\u2019t satisfied with her decision and had implored her to reconsider her options,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied.Zu An interjected right away, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to say anything unnecessary to me.\u201dHe initially thought that Chu Chuyan was forced into marrying him due to her parents\u2019 will; that would explain the dissatisfaction and killing intent she had directed toward him. However, what Cheng Shouping said earlier would eliminate such a possibility.But why would Chu Chuyan choose him as her spouse? That young miss\u2019 eyes were as sharp as they could get!Pui pui pui! She must have fallen for my dashing looks and desired a taste of my body!1. This is a reference to a Hong Kong movie, Flirting Scholar, where the main lead enters the House of Wah as a study companion to the two young masters of the house.2.

    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBarely a few seconds after arriving at this thought, Zu An\u2019s expression darkened once more. A curse had been put on this lousy body of his, such that he could do nothing even if a beautiful woman were to leap into his embrace.Recalling what Old Mi told him, he turned back to the young man beside him and asked, \u201cShouping, are you familiar with the Master stage?\u201d\u201cEveryone in the Zhou Dynasty knows about it. Is young master unfamiliar with it?\u201d Cheng Shouping looked at Zu An with a bewildered look.Zu An nearly choked on that. He quickly replied, \u201cOf course I am familiar with it! I was just testing you!\u201d\u201cI see!\u201d Cheng Shouping widened his eyes in realization. \u201cMasters are able to draw raw ki from the world freely, allowing them to soar freely in the sky. They are top-notch figures in this world.\u201dZu An was astonished to hear that. \u201cHow many Masters are there in our Brightmoon City?\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d Cheng Shouping looked as if he had just heard the joke of his life. \u201cNone at all!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zu An was stunned. Brightmoon City looked pretty big to him, so how could there not be even a single Master here?\u201cPutting aside Brightmoon City, I doubt that there are any Masters in our entire Linchuan Commandery!\u201d Cheng Shouping exclaimed. \u201cYou should know that in the Zhou Dynasty, only the Three Dukes, Grand Marshall, General of Swift Steed, and a few Kings are Masters. Given how few Masters there are around, so how could we have any in our Brightmoon City?Following that, Cheng Shouping began to explain how one\u2019s position corresponded to one\u2019s cultivation level in this world, raising waves of shock in Zu An\u2019s heart. Old Mi was making fun of me! There are only that many Masters in the world. Even with the help of the keyboard, I would have been a withered old man by the time I reach the Master stage. Not to mention, he doesn\u2019t even know that I have a cheat key with me. Just where did he get the confidence that I would be able to reach Master stage?While Zu An was still deep in thought, he suddenly noticed that Cheng Shouping was staring at him with a look that seemed to be saying \u2018be patient with the mentally challenged\u2019, and this left rage fuming in him. \u201cYou sure know quite a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201dCheng Shouping was smiling so brightly that his facial features almost seemed to be squeezing together. \u201cYoung master, you\u2019re flattering me.\u201d\u201cYou are a cultivator too?\u201dCheng Shouping\u2019s smile froze momentarily before he lowered his head gloomily and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. My lacking talent in cultivation prevents me from sensing raw ki.\u201dZu An nodded slightly. \u201cIdle people like you sure know how to live life well. You\u2019re so knowledgeable despite being unable to cultivate.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chen Shouping for +33 Rage!Zu An pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cAre there any extremely skilled physicians or the sort in Brightmoon City? The kind whose reputation has spread far and wide.\u201d This won\u2019t do. I\u2019d have already turned into an old man by the time I reach Master stage through the conventional way! I need to find some other means instead,Since this was a world of cultivation, there had to be miraculous physicians capable of pulling off the impossible around. Perhaps they would be able to resolve the problem he was facing.\u201cExtremely skilled physicians? Ah, there is one!\u201d Cheng Shouping seemed to enjoy the process of providing answers to others and resolving their doubts. \u201cDivine Physician Ji is Brightmoon City\u2019s\u2026 No, to be more accurate, he\u2019s the most skilled physician in the entire Linchuan Commandery. There\u2019s no illness that he can\u2019t treat!\u201d\u201cJi? He can\u2019t possibly be Ji Xiaolan, right?\u201d Zu An asked.\u201cJi Xiaolan?\u201d Cheng Shouping scratched his head in confusion. \u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201dZu An\u2019s interest was sparked. \u201cLet\u2019s go then! Bring me to him!\u201dCheng Shouping looked at him in confusion. \u201cYoung master, weren\u2019t you whipped by the Second Miss just a moment ago? No matter how I look at it, you should\u2026\u201dZu An\u2019s eyes swam about as he quickly spun up a lie. \u201cI\u2019m visiting Divine Physician Ji to have those wounds treated!\u201d\u201cBut our estate\u2019s physician has already applied medicine for young master earlier. You\u2019ll recover with a few days of rest. There\u2019s no need for you to look for Divine Physician Ji,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied.Black lines streaked across Zu An\u2019s face as he replied, \u201cAre you the young master or am I the young master? Why do you have so much nonsense? All you have to do is to bring me there!\u201d\u201cYoung master, please be appeased. I\u2019ll bring you there right away!\u201d Cheng Shouping quickly put on a fawning smile once more.Zu An was a little surprised. For him to not get mad with this, it seemed like this lad had a good temper. Now that he thought about it, the Rage points he received from insulting this lad earlier was also a fairly small amount. Perhaps the years he had spent in the Chu Estate had built up his tolerance.Zu An quickly changed his clothes before leaving the estate with Cheng Shouping. He was initially worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the estate, but surprisingly, while the guards at the entrance did spare him a second glance, they didn\u2019t stop him from leaving.He thought about the incident that happened the previous night and asked, \u201cWhere is the First Miss?\u201d\u201cThe First Miss appears to have gone out,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied.Zu An heaved a sigh of relief. For some reason, he felt great pressure facing that pair of master and servant. \u201cSpeaking of which, do you know Snow?\u201dCheng Shouping\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t know Sister Snow? She\u2019s the personal attendant of the First Miss! Not only is she beautiful, but she has a sweet voice as well. There are countless people in the estate who views her as their dream lover. Young master, if you don\u2019t mind, can you help bring us together?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense again.\u201d Zu An was rendered speechless. Where did this fellow get the confidence to court Snow? \u201cDon\u2019t bother thinking of such useless stuff. Do you have any information concerning her? For example, has she been working in the Chu Estate from a young age?\u201d\u201cAh, she didn\u2019t.\u201d Cheng Shouping was a little depressed to hear Zu An rejecting his request to help pair him and Snow together. It looks like the young master is interested in Snow too. I heard that the personal maidservants of large clans are usually given to the groom as concubines. \u201cSister Snow was saved and brought to the Chu Estate around three to four years ago. She\u2019s obedient and intelligent, so she quickly won the First Miss\u2019 favor and became appointed as her personal maidservant\u201cObedient?\u201d Zu An was cognitively incapable of associating that sharp-tongued lass with that word. He fell into deep thoughts after hearing that she had only joined the Chu Estate around three to four years back ago.\u201cOther than that, do you know the circumstances surrounding the second branch and the third branch? How are their relationships with my father-in-law\u2019s branch?\u201d Zu An thought about what had happened earlier today in the ancestral hall. He sensed an inexplicable enmity coming from Chu Tiesheng and Chu Yuepo.\u201cStill fine, I guess,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied contemplatively. \u201cThe second old master spends his days managing the arms trade whereas the third old master manages the salt trade. They are the close aides to our old master.\u201d\u201cArms? Salt?\u201d Zu An was taken aback. This was the world of cultivation! Even if they weren\u2019t managing the spirit stone trade, they should at least be rearing demonic beasts or that sort of fantasy stuff. Why were they dealing with\u2026 such ordinary commodities?As if having guessed Zu An\u2019s thoughts, Cheng Shouping explained, \u201cYoung master, you shouldn\u2019t underestimate these two commodities. They can bring about massive profits for the family. It\u2019s through these two commodities that our Chu clan managed to build up a fortune that even rivals that of a country. You should know that there are only a small number of individuals who are privileged to be able to cultivate in our world; most people are ordinary mortals like us, unable to sense the raw ki in the air. Arms and salt are necessities that we can\u2019t do without in our daily lives.\u201dZu An clicked his tongue in annoyance. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018we\u2019? Don\u2019t lump me together with ordinary mortals like you. I am someone who can cultivate!\u201dCheng Shouping blinked his eyes at Zu An, looking as if he was going to say something yet hesitating about it. He felt that the young master was really as the rumors put him out to be\u2014utterly inept yet boastful.However, it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s the young master after all. I\u2019ll help him win the First Miss\u2019 heart. There\u2019s no gratitude greater than one who delivers charcoal in a snowstorm. If I help him while he\u2019s still down, he\u2019ll view me as his confidant when he finally makes it big. Once that happens, I\u2019ll naturally rise through the ranks. Perhaps, I might even be able to get together with Snow\u2026 Teehee~\u201cWhat are you laughing foolishly to yourself for?\u201d Zu An smacked Cheng Shouping\u2019s head. \u201cWhere\u2019s Divine Physician Ji\u2019s residence?\u201dCheng Shouping quickly supported the two buns on his head to keep them in place. \u201cYoung master, you mustn\u2019t hit my head. It took me a lot of effort to comb this hairstyle!\u201dZu An looked at the two cha siu bao-like objects sitting atop Cheng Shouping\u2019s head, and he shook his head speechlessly. \u201cEnough. Hurry up and lead the way.\u201dHe had already gained a rough understanding of the situation in the Chu Estate. He still hadn\u2019t uncovered the culprit who was plotting his death yet, but what was more important right now was to resolve the problem plaguing the lower half of his body first!\u201cYoung master, I think you need not look for Divine Physician Ji anymore,\u201d Cheng Shouping quickly ran up to Zu An as he spoke.\u201cWhy is that so?\u201d Zu An was bewildered by that remark.Cheng Shouping explained, \u201cDivine Physician Ji has established a rule saying that anyone who seeks consultation with him has to pay 100 silver taels as consultation fee.\u201d\u201c100 silver taels just for a consultation? That\u2019s daylight robbery!\u201d From what Zu An had seen and heard over the last two days, he came to realize that the currency in this world was similar to that of ancient China. A thousand copper coins was equivalent to one silver tael, and ten silver taels was equivalent to one golden tael.There was still another currency that was more valuable than gold, and that was ki stones. However, ki stones were hard to come by, so it was difficult to quantify its value.However, the unit of measurement in this world differed from that of ancient China; it was similar to the modern world instead. One tael was equivalent to 50 grams. The purchasing power of silver here was still fairly high as its value hadn\u2019t depreciated due to overproduction. A silver tael was worth around 1800 RMB.To pay 100 silver taels, which was equivalent to 180,000 RMB, just for consultation was ridiculous. It was no wonder Zu An would kick up a fuss!Zu An pondered for a moment before putting his arms around Cheng Shouping\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLil\u2019 Pingping, I\u2019m a little short on cash at the moment. Can you do me a favor and help me this once? I\u2019ll pay you back with interest once I get the money.\u201dCheng Shouping silently grabbed the sachet hanging by his waist for security. \u201cYoung master, I\u2019m a mere servant. If even you don\u2019t have money, how could I have any?\u201dZu An had noticed Cheng Shouping\u2019s subtle movements, but he didn\u2019t pay any heed to it. Even if Cheng Shouping had some money on hand, it was unlikely that he would have 100 silver taels. \u201cDo you know if there\u2019s anywhere in Brightmoon City that sells slaves?\u201d\u201cYoung master, are you referring to the slave market? There\u2019s a place in the city for nobles to trade their servants and maids, and they are usually worth from a few to tens of silver taels\u2026\u201d Sheng Shouping said. A moment later, he suddenly froze in place. He turned stiffly to look at Zu An and gulped down a mouthful of saliva. \u201cYoung master, you can\u2019t be thinking of selling me, are you?\u201dZu An\u2019s expression immediately turned solemn. \u201cHow is that possible? What kind of person do you take me to be?\u201dZu An felt that Cheng Shouping was at most only worth a few silver taels. Besides, he was a servant of a Duke\u2019s estate, so it could be difficult to sell him out.Despite having received Zu An\u2019s reassurance, Cheng Shouping still felt a little unnerved. He quickly said, \u201cYoung master, there\u2019s actually another way around this. Aside from paying 100 silver taels, you can also get a consultation with him by accomplishing a task for him.\u201dThose words put Zu An\u2019s heart at ease. He slapped Cheng Shouping\u2019s shoulders and remarked heartily, \u201cYou should have said that earlier! I nearly sold you just now!\u201dCheng Shouping: \u201c\u2026\u201dLooking at Zu An\u2019s excited profile, Cheng Shouping found himself at a loss for words. One must know that the tasks set by Divine Physician Ji couldn\u2019t be accomplished by just anyone. Nevertheless, out of fear of getting sold, he refrained from telling the truth.Not too long later, the two of them arrived by a residence. Looking at the crowd gathered outside the residence, Zu An gulped down a mouthful of saliva. \u201cWhy are there so many people around?\u201dCheng Shouping laughed sheepishly as he replied, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell young master earlier? Divine Physician Ji\u2019s place is always swarming with people.\u201dZu An thought about those specialists in top-notch hospitals in his previous life, where one had to make an appointment a month ahead of time in order to have a consultation with them. Considering this, it was only natural for Divine Physician Ji\u2019s business to be booming too.Wait, this isn\u2019t right either. Doesn\u2019t a consultation cost 100 silver taels? Are the people of this world that rich? But these people gathered around are dressed quite shabbily, and it doesn\u2019t seem like they are well-to-do.\u201cWhere is Miss Ji? Why is Miss Ji not here?\u201d Someone amidst the crowd shouted, and it immediately stirred a commotion.\u201cThat\u2019s right, we want to meet Miss Ji!\u201d\u2026Zu An was stunned to hear all that. He turned to Cheng Shouping and asked, \u201cThe Divine Physician Ji you were referring to is a girl?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOf course not.\u201d Cheng Shouping replied as he tiptoed and curiously looked across the crowd. \u201cDivine Physician Ji is Miss Ji\u2019s father. On top of being a gorgeous beauty, she\u2019s also known to be a warm and kind person. She often provides free consultation for the poor, making her incredibly popular in the city. These people are likely here to catch a glimpse of Miss Ji.\u201dZu An grumbled, \u201cWhat gorgeous beauty? Even someone like Snow is deemed to be a beauty in your eyes. A mere study companion like you must have never seen real beauty before, or else your standards wouldn\u2019t have been this low!\u201dCheng Shouping\u2019s face flushed in indignance, but before he could respond, a red-faced man amongst the crowd heard the conversation between the duo and turned his head around. \u201cOi, brat! What do you know? Miss Ji is a beauty whose reputation rivals Miss Chu from the Duke\u2019s estate in our Brightmoon City! However, I heard that Miss Chu has recently married a useless wastrel, so there\u2019s no point mentioning her anymore. Right now, Miss Ji is the only goddess in my dreams!\u201dZu An\u2019s face turned incredibly livid. How could this fellow insult him right in his face? He wouldn\u2019t be a true keyboard warrior if he could take this lying down!So, he stuck his ear over and made it look as if he was listening earnestly to the red-faced man\u2019s words. Then, he replied with an incredibly loud voice, \u201cWhat did you say? Miss Ji is the goddess of your wet dreams?\u201dZu An was currently at the third step of the second rank, so his voice was much louder than an ordinary person. There was not a single person present who hadn\u2019t heard his words, and they immediately turned their heads over.This turn of events flustered the red-faced man. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m saying dreams\u2026\u201dBefore he could even explain himself, Zu An had already cut him off once more, \u201cAh, that explains why you said that you wanted to steal Miss Ji\u2019s possessions back home with you. My gosh, you are a disgusting excuse for a human being. Please stay away from me.\u201dAs Zu An spoke, he pushed the red-faced man backward, as if trying to stay away from the latter. His true goal, however, was to throw the red-faced man into the hands of the infuriated crowd.\u201cI didn\u2019t say that! I wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Sensing the eyes filled with murderous intent centered on him, the red-faced man panicked. He tried his best to explain himself, but all were rendered naught when someone amidst the crowd shouted \u201cGet him!\u201d.So, he ended up getting lynched by the crowd.You have successfully trolled Lu Renjia for +666 Rage!Zu An calmly tidied up his robe before leisurely making his way to the entrance of the residence.Meanwhile, Cheng Shouping blinked his eyes blankly. This works too? As surprised as he was, he quickly rushed forward to catch up with Zu An\u2019s footsteps.It was then that a furious howl sounded from the residence. \u201cAll of you, scram! What kind of a cacophony are you causing in front of another person\u2019s house in broad daylight! You\u2019re disturbing this old man\u2019s sleep!\u201dFollowing that, the tightly shut doors to the residence finally creaked open.\u201cDivine Physician Ji is out! Divine Physician Ji is out!\u201dThe crowd who was pummeling Lu Renjia a moment ago quickly dispersed to surround the doorway once more, leaving behind a pitiful man lying on the ground with footprints all over him.Zu An took a close look at the man who had just walked out of the residence. This man had a thin face that revealed hints of suaveness from his younger years. However, his untrimmed beard, the heavy eyebags he carried, and the heavy scent of alcohol on him that could be smelled even from a distance away made him look no different from a scruffy middle-aged man.However, Zu An didn\u2019t look down on him because of that. His ears were still ringing from his earlier roar. Without a doubt, the other party\u2019s cultivation was far higher than his.This is more like it. It\u2019s clear that this man has the air of a hidden expert, similar to that drunk sword immortal. Except that his face isn\u2019t that round.\u201cDivine Physician Ji, where\u2019s your daughter?\u201d A person standing by the side asked with a fawning smile.Divine Physician Ji shot him a glance and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cDivine Physician Ji, do you not recognize me anymore? I am Wang Fugui! I often drop by your place!\u201d That man hurriedly introduced himself.\u201cI don\u2019t remember you.\u201d Divine Physician Ji dug his ear before flicking his earwax off leisurely. \u201cThis Divine Physician only remembers the faces of pretty ladies. Why would I waste my effort remembering a mere moneybag\u2026 Cough cough, I mean, customer, you must have never paid any money here.\u201dWang Fugui laughed a little before replying, \u201cI have never patronized your business before, but Miss Ji has treated my illness several times\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Divine Physician Ji had already cut right in furiously, \u201cGoddamit! I knew that it was weird how my business has been waning recently. It turns out that that damned lass has been treating all of you for free. All of you, scram!\u201d\u201cDamned lass?\u201d Zu An was surprised to hear those words. To refer to his daughter in such a manner, are they really blood-related?\u201cWe\u2019re here to look for Miss Ji, not you\u2026\u201d Under Divine Physician Ji\u2019s glare, Wang Fugui\u2019s tone grew a little meeker.\u201cShe\u2019s not around! I sent her out of the city to pick some medicine so that she\u2019ll stop interrupting my business!\u201d Divine Physician Ji pulled out a chair and sat lazily on it. \u201cThose who want to be treated, either fork out 100 silver taels as consultation fee or complete my task. If you aren\u2019t here to be diagnosed, you better get out of my sight right now. Or else, don\u2019t blame me for getting nasty!\u201dUpon hearing that their goddess wasn\u2019t here, the crowd gathered outside the residence quickly scattered. The way how they were quick to act showed that this wasn\u2019t the first time such a thing had happened. A few individuals who earnestly wanted a consultation remained on the spot and begged, \u201cDivine Physician Ji, we can\u2019t afford to pay 100 silver taels. We\u2019re begging you, do some good and have mercy on us.\u201dDivine Physician Ji took a sip from the wine gourd he was carrying. Without bothering to look at any of these people in the eye, he said, \u201cI, Ji Dengtu, can treat hundreds of illnesses, but the illnesses that you are suffering from is beyond my means.\u201dA man amidst the crowd immediately panicked. \u201cI haven\u2019t even explained my symptoms to you yet, so how do you know that I can\u2019t be treated?\u201dDivine Physician Ji finally raised his gaze to look at the man in the eye. \u201cThat\u2019s because the illness you\u2019re suffering from is poverty! How can I treat something like that?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have any of the virtues that a physician ought to have! How can you call yourself a divine physician?\u201d That man\u2019s face turned scarlet as he turned around and left in a huff. It was obvious that his pride had been wounded.Meanwhile, Divine Physician Ji continued lying on top of his chair lazily while humming a tune. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to respond to the insults hurled at him.It was then that a man with a ratty face stepped forward and discreetly stuffed a picture book filled with vibrantly colored portraits into Divine Physician Ji\u2019s hands. \u201cDivine Physician Ji, I just managed to obtain this recently. It\u2019s the newest edition of Heaven On Earth.\u201dDivine Physician Ji immediately sat upright. He snatched the picture book over and hurriedly flipped through it. Zu An, who was standing close by, was able to vaguely see pictures of scantily-dressed ladies inside the book.\u201cThis isn\u2019t too bad!\u201d Divine Physician Ji stuffed the picture book into his clothes before patting the other party\u2019s shoulder with a look of approval. \u201cYou may go in. I\u2019ll treat you later on.\u201dThis freaking works too?Zu An was dumbstruck. I have Pimp of the Young Maidens, XX Records of Youth, Morphing Into a Dragon In the Face of Storm with me too\u2026 Do you want them? It\u2019s just a pity that I can\u2019t draw, or else I could just produce one and offer it to him\u2026\u201cWhy is he able to enter?\u201d The rest of the crowd who didn\u2019t see the bribery complained indignantly.Divine Physician Physician harrumphed with a stern face. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business. You want to enter too? Sure. Pay the consultation fee or finish my task!\u201d\u201cBut your task is simply too difficult! You\u2019re just making things hard for us!\u201d Someone complained.It was then that Zu An noticed a signboard by the doorway labeled \u2018Today\u2019s Task\u2019 that wrote: This Divine Physician is going to concoct a Ki Refinement Pill. I need 10 Assrip Wolf goubaos for my medicine.Zu An had heard of goubaos before. It was a stone-like object that grew inside a dog\u2019s stomach. It was usually spherical or elliptical in shape, and it was either ashen-white or grayish-black. It had the effect of soothing blood flow, clearing blockages, and detoxifying.However, what in the world was an Assrip Wolf? Some sort of wolf mutation in the world of cultivation?Hearing the complaints from those around, Divine Physician Ji looked at them as if he was looking at a bunch of idiots, and he said, \u201cDo I look dumb to you? Why would I bother giving out tasks if they aren\u2019t hard?\u201dThe crowd immediately lost their patience, and they began speaking over one another.\u201cBut every Assrip Wolf is at least at the second rank, and the leader of the pack could very well be in the third rank!\u201d\u201cThey always gather in packs which always contain anywhere between dozens of wolves to over a hundred! An ordinary person would only die against them!\u201d\u201cFurthermore, goubaos are incredibly rare! One would be lucky to find a single goubao from 10 Assrip Wolves!\u201d\u2026\u201cShut up! You\u2019re all too noisy!\u201d Divine Physician Ji glared at the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Assrip Wolves are powerful; all of you are simply too weak! If any of you were to reach rank four, wouldn\u2019t you be able to clear this task within minutes easily?\u201dVeins popped out from the temples of the crowd as they hollered. \u201cAny cultivator who has reached the fourth rank is already qualified to become a city lord! How can we possibly be compared with that kind of people?\u201dZu An watched the sight silently from the side. From the infuriated statements of the crowd, he realized that most of the cultivators were at the second rank, and there were hardly any third ranks around. Using such a standard as a gauge, wouldn\u2019t that mean that he was actually not that weak?\u201cCut the crap. Do the task if you want, or else just get lost! It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m forcing any of you into it!\u201d Divine Physician Ji lost his patience. \u201cStop blocking my doorway and obstructing my business. Shoo shoo shoo!\u201dZu An pulled the arm of Cheng Shouping and asked, \u201cThis fellow is so arrogant. Isn\u2019t he afraid of getting beaten up?\u201dCheng Shouping was shocked to hear those words. He quickly put his finger up to silence Zu An before quickly pulling him off to a remote place. \u201cDivine Physician Ji possesses unfathomable power. There has been plenty of impatient lads who tried to strong-arm him into treating them, but do you know what happened to them?\u201d\u201cThye got thrown out?\u201d Zu An asked.Cheng Shouping put on a look that clearly expressed \u2018You\u2019re still lacking in imagination\u2019 as he replied, \u201cThey\u2019re all lying under their tombstones right now.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s that vicious?\u201d Zu An stroked his lower jaw in astonishment. \u201cIsn\u2019t the magistrate going to interfere in this matter?\u201dCheng Shouping explained, \u201cDivine Physician Ji isn\u2019t a divine physician for nothing. You don\u2019t know how many experts are indebted to him over the years. Even the city lord has to show some respect in his presence. Not to mention, it\u2019s those lads who tried to strong-arm him first, so the case was eventually dropped without any punishment.\u201dZu An was still unwilling to give up just like that. \u201cIs there really no way to complete the task?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Cheng Shouping replied matter-of-factly. \u201cThose who are weak don\u2019t have the ability to complete the task, and those who are strong could simply pay the consultation fee instead of wasting their time on the task. There were simply too many people who had complained about his consultation fee. So, he came up with these impossible tasks to stuff their mouths.\u201d\u201cNo wonder!\u201d Zu An nodded in realization. That Ji fellow had set those tasks with the intention of having them being impossible to accomplish for the common populace in the first place!Wait a moment! A thought suddenly flashed across Zu An\u2019s mind, and he immediately shot a glance at Cheng Shouping. This darned thing knew that it is impossible for me to accomplish the task, yet he didn\u2019t give me a heads-up before bringing me here. He must be doing this in order to meet Miss Ji.Zu An\u2019s face turned dark, and he said, \u201cYou should return to the Chu Estate first. I\u2019ll walk around by myself.\u201d His happiness was at stake here, so he had to give it a try no matter how tough it was! He had the Poisonous Prick and the Poison Bottle anyway. As long as he was careful, he might just be able to complete the task.Of course, he had to make sure to do it behind the back of the Chu clan. The Chu clan thought of him as nothing but trash, and there were enemies lurking in the shadows who were out to take his life. If they were to learn that he had managed to raise his cultivation to the second rank, they would surely go even further the next time around.Lying low is the key to survival!Cheng Shouping was astonished. \u201cYoung master, you aren\u2019t thinking of attempting the task, are you?\u201dZu An wondered if he had made it obvious through his actions, but before he could come up with an excuse, Cheng Shouping had already hurriedly spoken up, \u201cYoung master, do you know why those wolves are named as Assrip Wolves?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cBecause of their fierce temper?\u201d Zu An tried asking.Cheng Shouping replied, \u201cIt\u2019s because they are skilled at striking the ass. Once they sink their sharp, jagged fangs into your rear, they\u2019ll never let go anymore. They\u2019ll tug everything out, and before you know, your intestines and organs are already spilling out.\u201d\u201cHey, say what you want, but stop running around me and point here and there!\u201d Zu An grumbled in irritation as he covered his ass. He really felt tempted to give Cheng Shouping a good kick.Cheng Shouping laughed in response. \u201cThis humble servant is just worried for young master\u2019s safety. Your ass is likely to rip against those wolves, which is why they call them the Assrip Wolves. Furthermore, those wolves are incredibly vindictive, and they like to gather in huge numbers. Even powerful cultivators are unwilling to get involved with them, opting to take a detour around them if possible!\u201dZu An felt a chilly sensation on his ass. He quickly harrumphed. \u201cDo you think that I would get involved with those disgusting things?\u201dCheng Shouping eyed Zu An suspiciously for a moment as he thought about all of the rumors surrounding him. His heart was put at ease. \u201cIt does seem unlikely for you to do so.\u201dSomehow, Zu An seemed to sense the mockery in Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to settle the score with him right now. \u201cYou return to the estate first. Remember, don\u2019t tell anyone that I\u2019ve come here.\u201dCheng Shouping also didn\u2019t want to stay here after hearing that Miss Ji wasn\u2019t around. He would rather head back to the estate and see if Sister Snow was back yet! So, he thumped his chest and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, young master. Have you forgotten what my name is? My mouth is sealed like a cork on a bottle!\u201dZu An looked at Cheng Shouping with doubtful eyes. Somehow, he felt that this fellow wasn\u2019t a very trustworthy individual.After sending Cheng Shouping away, Zu An grabbed a piece of cloth and covered his face with it before squeezing through the crowd. Due to the growth in his strength, it was a lot easier for him to shove others aside and make his way through. He looked at the scruffy middle-aged man lying on the chair and asked, \u201cAre you really able to treat all illnesses?\u201dHe had to verify this first. Otherwise, if he were to clear the task only to realize that his illness was untreatable, he would have made a huge loss!\u201cOther than the affliction of poverty, there\u2019s nothing in this world that I can\u2019t cure!\u201d Divine Physician Ji lay leisurely in his rocking chair, not bothering to open his eyes at all.\u201cWhat if I manage to finish the task but you can\u2019t treat my illness?\u201d Zu An still felt worried about this matter.Divine Physician Ji opened his eyes and assessed him from head to toe. Then, his eyes finally fell between Zu An\u2019s thighs, and he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a little fault in your crotch? You speak as if you have some sort of terminal illness!\u201dZu An felt a rush of delight in his heart. Since the other party was able to discern the root of his illness at a glance, it looked like there was a good chance that he could be cured!However, he soon noticed the bizarre glances that those in the surroundings were directing at him. After hearing that he had a problem there, most of them either felt pity or contempt for him.\u201cTsk tsk tsk. To actually become impotent at such a young age, it looks like youngsters nowadays are getting weaker!\u201d\u201cYou must learn from his lesson! If you don\u2019t work hard in your younger years, you\u2019ll only despair in your later years.\u201d\u201cAh? Could it be a sexually transmitted disease? Oof, will I get infected by standing so close to him?\u201d\u2026Zu An had no idea who said the last few words, but it took just a split moment for a vacuum to appear around him.He suddenly remembered a question he had seen on the internet in his previous life. If someone were to barge into the toilet while you\u2019re bathing to snap some photos, where should you cover first? It went without saying that the answer was the face!Zu An was glad that he had covered his face, or else he would have really embarrassed himself thoroughly. Speaking of which, this Divine Physician Ji was also too much. Had he never heard of a patient\u2019s confidentiality before? How could he shout something so private out loud!\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be accepting this task then. Where can I find the Assrip Wolves?\u201d Since no one could see his face, he might as well take advantage of this opportunity to gather some useful intelligence.\u201cYou?\u201d Divine Physician Ji eyed him from head to toe before shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re too weak. You\u2019re just going to get your ass wrecked.\u201d\u201cYou need not care about that. I wouldn\u2019t have accepted this task if I wasn\u2019t confident about it,\u201d Zu An replied. He was planning to take a look first, and if it was really impossible, he would just retreat and try writing out Pimp and the Young Maidens.\u201cI won\u2019t stop you if you\u2019re courting death. There\u2019s a Wolf Valley right outside the city, go and look for it yourself.\u201d Divine Physician Ji rolled his eyes at him before returning back to his nap.Zu An nodded his head before heading off. A man in the crowd tried to dissuade him from it. \u201cLad, don\u2019t go. There\u2019s nothing more important than your life!\u201dThose words, however, were immediately refuted by another man standing beside him, \u201cI can\u2019t agree with that. As a man, what\u2019s the point of living if something has happened down there?\u201d\u2026Zu An felt that he would be contributing Rage points to the keyboard personally if he were to remain here, so he quickly left the area with a livid face. However, barely after he walked a few steps away, a ceramic bottle was suddenly tossed into his hands.Huh, what\u2019s going on?While he was still taken aback by the object that had almost magically appeared in his hands, a voice sounded in his ears. \u201cRecovery medicine. It might just save your life. The Wolf Valley is very dangerous, so just run if things aren\u2019t working out.\u201dZu An could tell that this was Divine Physician Ji\u2019s voice. He turned around to take a look, only to see that the latter was still lying on his rocking chair, resting quietly. The crowd around the divine physician also didn\u2019t seem to have heard those words as they continued pleading desperately with him.Zu An felt a surge of warmth in his heart. It turned out that Divine Physician Ji was the sort of person with a sharp mouth but was a softie inside. As expected, how could there be a physician in the world who had no regard for human life?There was no way Zu An could have known that Divine Physician Ji was sneering coldly at the moment. You smeared my daughter\u2019s reputation earlier, huh? I\u2019ll give you a bottle of medicine to give you a false sense of security so that you\u2019ll venture deeper into the Wolf Valley. Heh, you\u2019ll be dead before you even know what struck you!As it turned out, Zu An\u2019s earlier words and actions didn\u2019t escape from Divine Physician Ji\u2019s sharp eyes and ears.There was no way Zu An could have known all of this. He cheerfully continued making his way out of the city. He was on Chu Chuyan\u2019s carriage the last time he was outside, so he wasn\u2019t able to get a good view of the outside world. So, this was the first time he was really looking around this brand new world.The layout of the streets and buildings all around were a little similar to the historical dramas in his previous world, though the dress-up of the crowd was different.The usual attire in ancient China was conservative, hiding as much skin as possible. However, the culture of this world was a little different. In fact, he had already spotted quite a few women revealing their smooth fair thighs while walking around.They were wearing skirts, but the women of this world weren\u2019t shy in showing off their figures. The men around them appeared to be perfectly used to it too.For a moment there, Zu An felt as if he had returned back to his own era, back to the streets he was familiar with, where suave men and beautiful women wore all sorts of different clothing. The only difference was that the attires in this world had an old oriental touch to them.It looked like this world of cultivation was much more open than ancient China. After the initial astonishment, Zu An quickly grew accustomed to his surroundings. There were also plenty of women back in his previous world who wore hanfu out into the streets anyway.Hm? Why does that woman have an additional pair of ears on her head? What\u2019s with that thing swaying behind her bum?How frightening!Zu An gasped in astonishment. It was then that he recalled the world\u2019s history that he had heard from Cheng Shouping earlier. A thousand years ago, the emperor led mankind into a war against the foreign tribes, eventually driving them to the borders of the world.Thousand years of fighting had caused all sorts of factions to intersect with one another. There were many from the foreign tribes who chose to live in human countries, and the humans didn\u2019t hunt them down either. Somehow, both sides had come to some sort of compromise of co-existence.Zu An had been paying close heed along the way, and he noticed that the ratio of foreign tribes amongst the populace was still very low, roughly the same probability of spotting a foreigner in his homeland in his previous life. Mankind still had the dominant position here.It\u2019s just a pity that I have no interest in beastmen. What catwoman and wolfgirl, those don\u2019t pique my interest at all. Though I do have some interest in foxy vixens.Zu An\u2019s thoughts were running wild. I wonder if there are any elves here. I do like elves quite a bit. Mermaids would be great too, though I wonder if the mermaids in this world have legs or a tail below.(There\u2019s a scene in The Mermaid where the policemen were asked to draw out a witness portrait of a mermaid, and they drew a fish head with human legs.)Ah, could there be dragons here too? Dragon girls really do interest me. I just fear that given the massive size of dragons, will I end up getting crushed to death?\u2026However, thinking about his body\u2019s current condition, Zu An\u2019s excited face crumbled into despair. \u201cI can\u2019t even get it to stand now, so what\u2019s the point of thinking about all this?\u201dAll of a sudden, Zu An felt someone tapping on his shoulder. A voice sounded from behind, \u201cBrother Zu, where are you heading to?\u201dZu An turned around to take a look, and he saw a man dressed in black looking at him with a cheerful smile. There was a black mole on his lower jaw, which bounced up and down as he spoke. There was also a glaring tattoo on his neck that seemed to be an artistic impression of the word \u2018Twelve\u2019.It was fortunate that the previous owner of this body wasn\u2019t illiterate, or else he would really be troubled transmigrating into his body.Zu An felt a headache being approached by this man. Judging just by his facial features, this man had a standard villain face. Why the hell am I so unlucky? Problems simply have to crop up every single time I head out.Seeing that Zu An wasn\u2019t responding, a cold glint of light flashed across his eyes, but he quickly concealed it with a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you not recognize me anymore? I\u2019m Plum Blossom Twelve! We had alcohol and played dice together!\u201dPlum Blossom? Is there such a weird surname in the world?Zu An couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cCould it be that you have a younger sister called Plum Blossom Thirteen?\u201d\u201cSister?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve was stunned for a moment before he burst into laughter. \u201cIf my thirteenth brother were to hear that, he would surely give you a good pummeling!\u201dAh? There\u2019s really a Plum Blossom Thirteen?A hint of expectation arose in Zu An\u2019s heart. \u201cThen, do you know a hairstylist named Wu Liuqi?\u201d\u201cWu Liuqi? Hairstylist? What are you talking about? I\u2019ve never heard of him before.\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve was confused. \u201cWhy? Do you know him?\u201dZu An shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve was rendered speechless. Why are you asking me if I know Wu Liuqi if you don\u2019t know him yourself either?You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +10 Rage!Zu An looked at the man before him in surprise. You\u2019re getting angry just like that? Seems like you\u2019re quite a narrow-minded person.\u201cHm? Why does it look like you have buffed up quite a bit?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve grabbed Zu An\u2019s shoulder and began squeezing it a little.You damned pervert, Zu An thought as he shook off Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s grip. \u201cIt could be due to the good food in the duke\u2019s estate.\u201d He intentionally brought up the name of the Chu clan, hoping that Plum Blossom Twelve would back down. He had something to attend to at the moment, and he didn\u2019t want any complications.Who are you trying to fool here? No matter what you ate, there\u2019s no way you could have grown that quickly in just two days, Plum Blossom Twelve thought. However, there was no way he could have imagined that Zu An would have become a cultivator overnight. \u201cWhere are you heading to?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m thinking of taking a quick trip out of the city,\u201d Zu An replied vaguely.Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s eyes lit up as he exclaimed, \u201cWhat a coincidence! I\u2019m heading out of the city too, buddy!\u201dZu An looked at Plum Blossom Twelve with an unreadable smile and asked, \u201cIs that so? May I know where Brother Twelve is heading to then?\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve\u2019s eyes swam around the place as he asked back, \u201cBro, where are you heading to?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m heading to the Wolf Valley,\u201d Zu An replied frankly.\u201cWhat a coincidence, I\u2019m heading there too!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve replied gleefully. This fellow is a fool, just as always. He really doesn\u2019t know how to guard against people at all!Hm? Wait a moment, why is this fellow heading to the Wolf Valley?Forget it, who cares where he\u2019s heading to? The Wolf Valley is a great place to get rid of him to steal his items anyway. I can just throw him into the wolf pack, and no one will know better. The Chu clan will never be able to trace the matter down to me.He had failed in his mission the previous time. He never thought that the other party could live even after being struck by lightning, causing him to be severely punished by his sect leader.You shan\u2019t be escaping from my clutches this time around!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An chuckled to himself. \u201cIt would be wonderful to have Brother Twelve taking care of me along the way.\u201d He had already verified that this fellow had vile intentions in his mind. This was a good opportunity for him to figure out just who the one aiming to take his life was.So, the two of them left the city together.It was only today that Zu An finally realized just how fortunate he was on his first day. The suburbs he woke up at were, strictly speaking, not really the suburbs. It was still considered to be within human territory as there were soldiers and cultivators patrolling the area to prevent wild beasts from harming anyone. Anywhere beyond there would be really the wilderness. Just the Hidden Dragon Mountain in the vicinity of Brightmoon City had innumerable wild beasts running amok there.From time to time, wild beasts would appear at the foot of the mountain and harm those passing by the area. The main point of the sentry posts between the wilderness and the suburbs was to guard against the wild beasts, as well as to advise ordinary mortals who didn\u2019t know better to turn back.It was fortunate that Zu An had Plum Blossom Twelve with him. The latter brought out an item that appeared to be travel documents and revealed his cultivation too, and it was only then that the guards of the sentry posts finally allowed them to pass.After leaving the sentry post, Zu An turned to look at Plum Blossom Twelve with a look of admiration. \u201cBrother, what\u2019s your current cultivation level? Those soldiers seem to look up to you.\u201d He was making use of the opportunity while the other party didn\u2019t know about his own circumstances to scout some news, so that he could make countermeasures in advance.Plum Blossom Twelve was obviously flattered by Zu An\u2019s words. \u201cIt\u2019s still so-so. I\u2019m only at the third step of the second rank.\u201dLooks like he isn\u2019t that powerful either. That\u2019s equivalent to me cultivating for a day, Zu An thought.Plum Blossom Twelve was waiting for Zu An to lavish him with praises so that he could continue his humblebragging, but unexpectedly, the latter looked completely dazed, not saying a word at all.However, Plum Blossom Twelve quickly rationalized it as the trash Zu An not knowing the basic cultivation levels at all. Naturally, the latter wouldn\u2019t know just how difficult it was to reach the third step of the second rank.Zu An continued asking, \u201cWow. You must be the strongest one amongst your brothers, right?\u201d He remembered those novels he had read in his previous life, where after the protagonist got rid of an enemy, the enemy\u2019s friends, family, backing, and all sorts of nonsense would pop out. This showed the importance of gathering information before doing anything.\u201cNay, that\u2019s not so. There are quite a few who are as strong as me, and the strongest one is actually my thirteenth brother. He\u2019s already reached the third rank,\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve replied with a proud tone. His thirteen brothers had been enjoying quite a bit of fame over the last few years.\u201cIf all of you are this formidable, wouldn\u2019t your sect leader be a really incredible figure?\u201d Zu An went along with the flow and asked.\u201cOf course! Our sect leader is already\u2026\u201d It was then that Plum Blossom Twelve suddenly realized that he was talking too much, so he quickly changed his words. \u201cForget it. You don\u2019t know anything about cultivation anyway. What\u2019s the point of saying all of this to you?\u201dZu An felt a bit regretful that Plum Blossom Twelve noticed his intention, but he did manage to gather quite a bit of useful intelligence.Shortly after leaving the sentry post, they found a person walking in their direction. That person\u2019s face visibly darkened upon seeing Plum Blossom Twelve. He immediately pulled down his bamboo hat, turned around, and began walking away hurriedly.Plum Blossom Twelve seemed to recognize that person. He quickly took a few large strides over to catch up with that person, calling out, \u201cBrother Tan, what are you in such a rush for?\u201dSeeing that he had been recognized, the person also stopped his attempt to escape. He tightened his grip around the saber in his hand as he asked, \u201cPlum Blossom Twelve, are you here to capture me?\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve raised his hands up to indicate that he had no ill will in mind. \u201cBrother Tan, it\u2019s one thing for you to suspect others, but why are you suspecting me too? Do you still remember those days we spent fighting against the Azure Dragon Sect? If not for you risking your life to carry me out, I would have already been dead by now!\u201d\u201cYou still remember that?\u201d Brother Tan\u2019s expression visibly alleviated after hearing those words.\u201cHow could I ever forget your grace? In the first place, it\u2019s just a misunderstanding between you and our sect leader. It should be fine as long as you explain things to the sect leader properly, so why do you have to run?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve asked. \u201cWe used to hang out with one another, eating meat and drinking wine heartily together. But ever since you left, I haven\u2019t been able to find anyone else to accompany me.\u201dBrother Tan\u2019s eyes reddened. Veins popped out from his hands as he said, \u201cYou need not speak on his behalf. How can I possibly swallow the humiliation of having my wife taken away from me? My only regret is my failure to kill him with my saber back then!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say anything about the grudge between you and the sect leader. From a personal point of view, I really pity you.\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve patted Brother Tan\u2019s shoulder in consolation. \u201cHowever, a true man like you won\u2019t have any lack of women. Given your capabilities, you can easily find a place for yourself. There\u2019s no need to lose heart.\u201dBrother Tan\u2019s eyes glimmered in gratitude. \u201cOur brothers have been hunting me down over the last few days. You\u2019re the only one who still cares about me.\u201d\u201cOf course! We\u2019re brothers who have braved through danger with one another! How can we be the same as the others?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve replied with a chuckle.Brother Tan was deeply moved. \u201cBrother, can I entrust you with something?\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve patted his chest and said, \u201cFeel free to speak your mind! As long as you don\u2019t ask me to betray my sect, I\u2019ll do anything for you!\u201d\u201cOf course, I won\u2019t ask anything of you that puts you in a spot!\u201d Brother Tan explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like this. As I escaped in a hurry, I wasn\u2019t able to bring out the 100 silver taels that I saved up over the years. Can you return to the sect and fetch it for me? I\u2019ll split half of it with you!\u201d\u201cBrother Tan, you\u2019re being too courteous with me! That\u2019s nothing much at all! How could I take the money from my benefactor? Don\u2019t worry, you can count on me to retrieve your money!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve said with a wave of his hand.\u201cYou\u2019re truly a good brother!\u201d Brother Tan was delighted. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll surely split half of it with you once the deed is done! My money is hidden in the wall of my residence\u2019s backyard, behind the ninth brick on the sixth row\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, I got it down.\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve nodded. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m a bit busy at the moment. I\u2019m accompanying this brother here to the Wolf Valley, so you\u2019ll have to wait a while for me.\u201dBrother Tan shot a glance at the ditzy-looking Zu An, and he immediately understood what was going on. He knew just what kind of place the Wolf Valley was\u2014it was perfect for disposing of corpses, and they had often used that location to eliminate high-profile targets whom they couldn\u2019t deal with openly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll help you take care of him.\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve clasped his fist. \u201cMy deepest gratitude to you then, Brother Tan.\u201dWatching as Brother Tan made his way toward him with a saber in hand, Zu An felt a little stifled. \u201cWhy am I the one suffering over your brotherhood?\u201dWhile Zu An was wondering if he should reveal his cultivation, his body suddenly stiffened in shock. Right before his eyes, Plum Blossom Twelve suddenly darted forward, pulled Brother Tan back by his face, and slit a dagger right across his neck.Brother Tan grabbed his neck in horror as he staggered forward. He pointed a finger at Plum Blossom Twelve incredulously as he muttered hoarsely, \u201cY-you\u2026\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve took out a handkerchief to wipe off the blood on his dagger. \u201cSince I get to obtain the reward from our sect leader and monopolize your money by killing you, why should I bother helping you?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t\u2026 won\u2019t die a\u2026 good death\u2026\u201d Grabbing his throat desperately, Brother Tan fell to the ground before finally breathing his last. Even after death, his eyes were still widened from indignance, unable to rest in peace.\u201cOnly the weak bark insults in a fit of anger.\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve placed his dagger back into its sheath. He walked over to Zu An and assured him. \u201cBrother Zu, you need not be afraid. He\u2019s a traitor of our sect, a person who deserves to die!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Zu An gulped down a mouthful of saliva. Plum Blossom Twelve \u2018Brother Zu\u2019 sounded particularly jarring all of a sudden. After all, the last person whom the latter addressed as a \u2018brother\u2019 was currently lying on the ground, deader than a pig.For the latter part of the journey, the atmosphere between the two of them felt a little heavy. It was only due to the refreshing and sweet clean air around that Zu An felt a little more composed on the inside. Perhaps it was due to the raw ki lingering in the air. It was no wonder why so many people in this world were able to cultivate.They didn\u2019t encounter any danger for the next part of the journey as they were still in the vicinity of the border patrols. It was uncommon for wild beasts to venture out of the Hidden Dragon Mountain, and those that did were usually not too strong either.\u201cNow that I think about it, why are you heading to the Wolf Valley?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve suddenly asked out of curiosity.\u201cDivine Physician Ji has issued a task to gather goubaos. I\u2019m heading there in hopes that I might somehow luck out.\u201d Zu An spoke with an expression as naive as it could get.\u201cLuck out?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve burst into hearty laughter. Even he would only dare to walk around the outskirts of the Wolf Valley, but this fellow actually dreamed of entering the valley to search for goubaos?Zu An laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cI\u2019m just trying out my luck. Who knows? Maybe I might just find some wolf carcasses lying around.\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve looked at Zu An in disdain, thinking that this brat sure was dumber than a rock. Nevertheless, he still held back his urge from saying anything. If the latter were to back down right now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish his plan. \u201cYou\u2019re the son-in-law of the Chu clan. Can\u2019t you get them to pay the consultation fee instead?\u201dHe had heard of the rules about Divine Physician Ji\u2019s clinic too.Zu An sighed deeply and said, \u201cBrother, what kind of place could a son-in-law like me possibly have in the Chu clan? Everyone looks down on me, so who would bother sparing me any money? In the end, it\u2019s brothers like you that treat me the best. We haven\u2019t met for such a long time, but you\u2019re still willing to do me this huge favor.\u201d\u201cOf course! If I don\u2019t stand up for my brothers, who else should I stand up for?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve was impressed than this dumb lad actually had some self-awareness. \u201cIs the First Miss of the Chu clan really pretty?\u201dSomeone like him couldn\u2019t possibly have the opportunity to meet the lofty First Miss of the Chu clan. All he knew of her were from the rumors floating around.\u201cShe\u2019s like a fairy descending from heaven,\u201d Zu An replied honestly. That wife of his was indeed a looker.\u201cHow did it go with her? Did it feel like you were floating into the sky?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve shot Zu An a licentious look as he asked.Zu An sneered coldly on the inside, but his response was the opposite. \u201cShe was fair, tender, and smooth. It was the best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve gulped down a mouthful of saliva as he remarked in envy, \u201cYou sure are a lucky son of a bitch.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +99 Rage!Zu An was delighted. It seemed like this Plum Blossom Twelve was another toad lusting for the flesh of a swan.The smell of blood suddenly drifted over from afar. Right ahead of them, there were some bone fragments scattered over the ground. It was hard to tell what animal it had come from. Plum Blossom Twelve chuckled to himself and said, \u201cThose wild beasts that venture out of the Hidden Dragon Mountain would at least still leave some remains behind. However, if you were to fall into the hands of those Assrip Wolves, there won\u2019t be anything left by the time they\u2019re done with you.\u201dThey were already incredibly close to the Wolf Valley now. There was no longer anyone around, so Plum Blossom Twelve was no longer afraid of Zu An backing out anymore.\u201cSo that\u2019s the Wolf Valley?\u201d Zu An could vaguely see a valley right in front of him. Feigning a look of fright, he grabbed Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s arm and exclaimed, \u201cBig brother, you need to protect me! You\u2019re a formidable cultivator, right?\u201d\u201cYeap, it\u2019s right in front of us. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure to \u2018protect\u2019 you properly,\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve said with a sinister smile. \u201cZu An, do you know that I\u2019ve always been quite in awe of you? Say, how can a person be so naive? You haven\u2019t grown any smarter after surviving the lightning strike. Look, you walked right into my trap right after.\u201dZu An \u2018panicked\u2019. \u201cBig brother, what are you talking about?\u201dHe was initially intending to catch Plum Blossom Twelve off guard and assault him, but the latter\u2019s words convinced him to stay put for the time being. He realized that it was a good opportunity for him to gather some intelligence regarding this matter.In any case, the other party was still slightly weaker than him at the moment, and he had trump cards like the Poisonous Prick and the Poison Bottle in his hands. He thought that he stood a good chance against Plum Blossom Twelve.Plum Blossom Twelve pushed Zu An away, and the latter fell to the ground right away like a weakling. This deepened the disdain in Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s eyes. He brushed the part of his robe that Zu An had grabbed earlier. \u201cSince I\u2019m in a good mood today, I shall enlighten you before sending you on your way. Yes, I was the one who brought you to the suburb and tied you onto a tree on that stormy night. I just didn\u2019t think that you would be so lucky as to not survive even after getting struck.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have no grudge with you, so why must you harm me so?!\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve replied with a cold sneer, \u201cYou only have yourself to blame for offending someone whom you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\u201cWho did I offend?\u201d Zu An asked anxiously.Plum Blossom Twelve stepped on his back and smacked his face with his dagger. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know that. Why don\u2019t you ask King Yama once you reach the underworld instead?\u201dZu An was a little surprised by the remark. This world actually had the concepts of King Yama and the underworld too?\u201cThe Chu clan will never let you off if you dare to kill me!\u201d Zu An asked probingly. He wanted to check if the culprit was a member of the Chu clan.\u201cAhhh, I\u2019m so scared~\u201d Plum Blosson Twelve patted his heart in with an exaggerated look of fright. \u201cWe\u2019re in the wilderness, and your corpse will never be found. No one will know how you died.\u201dAt this point, Plum Blossom Twelve paused for a brief moment before continuing on, \u201cHowever, it\u2019s good that you have reminded me so. It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. You\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t make a move on you myself. I shall toss you into the Wolf Valley and have the Assrip Wolves devour every last bit of your body. By then, not even the Chu clan will be able to trace the matter to me!\u201dZu An was a little surprised. Judging from the tone, it seemed like the culprit behind this matter wasn\u2019t someone from the Chu clan?\u201cAh, do you know why they are called the Assrip Wolves?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve asked with a sinister smile. Before Zu An could reply, he had already given the answer away. \u201cThat\u2019s because they are skilled in tearing one\u2019s ass apart. They don\u2019t kill their prey right away. You\u2019ll be forced to watch helplessly as they tear your intestines out and gnaw at you bit by bit. I wonder just how painful that would be.\u201dZu An was perplexed. What was the point of saying all of this now? Did Plum Blossom Twelve have some sort of torture or gore fetish?Plum Blossom Twelve thought that Zu An had gone utterly silent out of fear, so he paid no heed to it. He continued his monologue gleefully, as everything was under his control. \u201cHowever, if you could answer some questions of mine, I can consider granting you a quick death so that you won\u2019t have to go through such pain.\u201d\u201cWhat questions?\u201d Zu An asked. Could it be that the owner of this body had found out some shocking secret, which prompted others to send assassins after him?Plum Blossom Twelve squatted down and looked at Zu An with a bizarre smile on his face. \u201cHow big is the First Miss of the Chu clan?\u201dZu An: \u201c???\u201dHe had thought of all sorts of possible questions that Plum Blossom Twelve could ask, but who could have thought that it would be this?\u201cAround this big.\u201d Zu An portrayed it casually with his hands. He might not have seen it before, but it was not as if Plum Blossom Twelve would know better.\u201cWhat about her waist? How slender is it?\u201d\u201cAround this size, I think?\u201d Zu An was already starting to lose his patience. If he couldn\u2019t obtain any more intelligence out of the other party, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to waste time here with him anymore.\u201cWhat about down there? How does she sound? Holy shit, I\u2019m getting hard just thinking about it!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve felt his throat turning parched from the heat. He pulled down his pants and ordered, \u201cCome, suck on it!\u201dIt was impossible for him to have a taste of the First Miss of the Chu clan in his entire life anyway, so he might as well have a taste of her through this indirect method.Zu An: \u201c???\u201dHe was planning on sounding Plum Blossom Twelve out so that he could uncover the identities of his enemies. Yet, this fellow was far more perverted than he had thought!Unable to stand it anymore, the darkened-faced Zu An grabbed the dagger from the other party\u2019s hands, and without any hesitation, he sliced away the root of all evil.\u201cAHHHH!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve was too distracted to put up his defenses in time. With a shriek of agony, he grabbed his crotch and rolled all over the ground. Then, he knocked his head on a tree and lost consciousness.Plum Blossom Twelve had a very long dream. In the dream, he saw his sect leader sending him into the royal palace as a eunuch. He was first pinned down onto the table and was severed of his manhood before being tossed into a room. He was locked up for several days straight, not given any food or drink. His throat was so parched that he felt like he was going to die of thirst.Perhaps it was because heaven had heard his pleading, the sky actually started raining. The rain felt warm to the touch, and it had a delectable saltiness to it.He greedily slurped it up, only to swiftly realize that something was amiss. He immediately opened his eyes and found himself tied to a tree. He tried his best to struggle the rope off him, but it wasn\u2019t budging at all. It was then that he noticed that the rope was no ordinary tool. It was prepared specially to deal with low-level cultivators like him.What\u2019s going on here?For a moment there, Plum Blossom Twelve was dumbfounded. Wasn\u2019t he in the midst of bringing that useless trash Zu An over to the Wolf Valley? He suddenly noticed that his face was a little wet, so he subconsciously licked it. It was the same taste as what he drank in his dream.By the side of the tree, Zu An pulled up his pants and apologized, \u201cMy bad. You simply wouldn\u2019t wake up, and I couldn\u2019t find any water around to splash you awake with. So, I can only make use of what I have. It has been a bit too hot the last two days, so it ended up being a little yellowish.\u201dAfter hearing those words, how could Plum Blossom Twelve still not know what the liquid on his face was? He could still remember how he drank several mouthfuls of it in his dream, as his body shuddered in sheer horror. \u201cBloody hell!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blosson Twelve for +777 Rage!\u201cBro, it looks like the weather is getting to you too.\u201d Zu An felt his heart flowering. This was such a good opportunity for him to earn some Rage points. As a keyboard warrior, he would be embarrassed if he failed to exploit this opportunity to its fullest!Plum Blossom Twelve bellowed angrily, \u201cHow dare you tie me up? Hurry up and release me!\u201dZu An leaped down from the fallen tree trunk he was standing on. \u201cHave you forgotten what happened earlier?\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve was taken aback as he quickly recounted the chain of affairs. I was stepping on this lad earlier, wanting him to give me a\u2026 It was at this moment that he hurriedly lowered his head to take a look, only to see a bloodied mess on his crotch. Even though the flow of blood had already been stopped, what that should have been there was no longer there! He let out a miserable cry and exclaimed, \u201cWhere did it go?!\u201dHis furious howl caused his wounds to rupture open once more, causing blood to spurt out from his crotch.Zu An was really impressed by just how resilient the constitution of cultivators was. Had it been in his previous world, a man who suffered such an injury should have already died from excessive blood loss by now. Yet, Plum Blossom Twelve was actually able to last this long.Zu An dug his ears casually, irritated by the sudden howl from Plum Blossom Twelve. He pointed to the long bamboo pole not too far away. There was a thin thread hanging at the end of the bamboo pole, and a bloodied finger-like object was tied to it. \u201cThere. Your treasure is right there.\u201d\u201cYou bastard! You dared to assault me!\u201d Recalling everything that just happened, Plum Blossom Twelve realized that he had been done in.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +999 Rage!It seems like men, regardless of which world they are from, are extremely concerned about their treasure. Zu An thought after seeing the unprecedentedly huge influx of Rage points.\u201cYou are cultivator too?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve calmed down a little and asked.Even if he was caught off guard, there was no way an ordinary mortal could have snatched his dagger away just like that.Thinking about the immense strength Zu An had exerted back then, it would appear that Zu An\u2019s cultivation level was even higher than his. But how could this be? That man was clearly completely powerless before him two days back!\u201cI\u2019m the one doing the questioning here, not you.\u201d Zu An patted the dagger against Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s mouth. \u201cSpeak! Who\u2019s the one who ordered you to kill me?\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve didn\u2019t expect the tables to be turned on him so quickly. However, he was still in a fit of rage, so he turned his head sideward, refusing to say anything at all.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to speak, huh?\u201d Zu An didn\u2019t lose his temper because of Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s reaction. Instead, he picked up the bamboo pole by the side and dangled the finger-like object in front of Plum Blossom Twelve. \u201cActually, having it severed is not as severe as you think. If you treat it in time, you might just be able to reattach it. However, if you delay for too long, the cells will slowly die out\u2026 By then, even a deity wouldn\u2019t be able to save you anymore!\u201dAt least, that was the case in his previous life. Considering that this was the world of cultivation, where all sorts of supernatural powers existed, it should be possible to do the same here too.Plum Blossom Twelve was persuaded by Zu An\u2019s words. Spirit returned back to his despaired eyes as he asked, \u201cWill you really let me go if I speak?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d Zu An replied.Plum Blossom Twelve harrumphed coldly. He was usually the one doing the threatening, so how could he possibly not know how the story usually went?Zu An shrugged casually. \u201cYou won\u2019t stand a chance at all if you don\u2019t talk at all. If you talk, there might still be a chance. You can choose for yourself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an order from my sect leader,\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve replied.\u201cWhat\u2019s your sect leader\u2019s name?\u201d Zu An asked.Plum Blossom Twelve hesitated a little. He scanned his surroundings warily, and after confirming that there was no one around, he finally replied, \u201cThe name of my sect leader is Mei Chaofeng.\u201dPaying heed to Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s actions, Zu An figured that the other party must be rather afraid of his sect leader. Wait a moment, Mei Chaofeng?\u201cIt can\u2019t be that your sect leader is a blind woman, right?\u201d Zu An gulped down a mouthful of saliva.\u201cHuh? Of course not.\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve replied in confusion. He had no idea why Zu An would suddenly ask such a question. \u201cOur sect leader is a man through and through.\u201dAfter verifying a few more details, Zu An was able to ascertain that the so-called sect leader wasn\u2019t the same person he was thinking of. Zu An ran through his memories, but he didn\u2019t have any impression of the sect leader of the Plum Blossom Sect. So, he asked, \u201cWhy does your sect leader want to kill me?\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve\u2019s eyes swam around a little. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mere underlings like us can fathom the thoughts of the sect leader.\u201dZu An sneered coldly. \u201cYou want to play games with me?\u201d He grabbed the bamboo pole and made an action of tossing it toward the valley.\u201cW-wait, Wait! I remember it now!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve exclaimed in anxiety. \u201cA mysterious person dropped by to look for our sect leader one day. Our sect leader brought him into his private chamber, and they had a long chat with one another. Right after that, he issued the order for me to get rid of you.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s that mysterious person?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be calling him a mysterious person if I knew!\u201dZu An scoffed coldly in response. \u201cIt looks like you need to learn a lesson before you\u2019re willing to talk, huh?\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve hurriedly exclaimed, \u201cI really don\u2019t know who that person is! That person was covered wearing a black bamboo hat that veiled his entire body. I don\u2019t even know if that person is a guy or a girl, let alone his identity!\u201dSeeing that Plum Blossom Twelve was already on the verge of tears, Zu An figured that he was likely telling the truth. So, he decided to switch to another question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the current situation in your Plum Blossom Sect?\u201dAfter some questioning, Zu An finally got a rough grasp of the situation. The Plum Blossom Sect was the biggest underground sect in Brightmoon City. The sect leader was Mei Chaofeng, and he had 13 godsons. They were named Plum Blossom One all the way to Plum Blosson Thirteen, and those in the pugilistic world knew them as the Thirteen Guardians of Plum Blossom.The Plum Blossom Sect controlled most of the underground businesses of Brightmoon City, and their greatest source of income stemmed from the protection fee they imposed on businesses and the casinos they operated.After divulging the abilities of the Thirteen Guardians of Plum Blossom, Plum Blossom Twelve finally asked, \u201cCan you return my treasure back to me now?\u201d His eyes had never left the thing hanging on the bamboo pole all this while, not even for a moment. Once I recover from this, I\u2019ll crush this bastard\u2019s jewels and feed it to the dogs. After that, I\u2019ll mince him bit by bit until my anger finally quells!On the other hand, Zu An watched the notifications that kept popping up \u201cYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +9 +9 +9 +9\u2026\u201d, and he was extremely delighted. It looked like this fellow really carried a deep grudge against him.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll give it back to you.\u201dHe felt uncomfortable holding it even if it was via a bamboo pole. So, he quickly took it over to Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s side.It was then that a black silhouette suddenly swooped down. There was the sound of flapping wings before the thing that was hanging at the end of the bamboo pole disappeared without a trace.Zu An turned to look at the massive black bird that had just perched on a nearby tree branch. It looked a little like a crow, but it was much larger than that. There was a worm-like object hanging between its beak at the moment\u2026 What else could it be other than Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s treasure?The crow looked at the two men below gleefully before tilting its head upward and swallowing the \u2018worm\u2019 down into its stomach.\u201cNOOOOO!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve cried in horror. The crow was appalled by the screams and hurriedly flew away.Zu An: \u201c\u2026\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An smiled sheepishly as he said, \u201cBro, you can\u2019t blame me for that.\u201d\u201cScrew you!\u201d A stream of blood spurted forth from between Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s legs before he blacked out once again.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +999 Rage!Seeing how it was only 999 Rage points despite the current turn of events, Zu An figured that this must be a hard cap to the amount of Rage points he could gather in a single sitting.Awoooo~From afar, the howling of a wild beast could be heard. Zu An quickly hid by the corner and looked at the valley far ahead of him. There were some gray shadows moving about. Most likely, they were the legendary Assrip Wolves.Thinking about the goal he had intended to achieve here, an idea suddenly came to his mind.\u2026When Plum Blossom Twelve woke up once more, he found that he was no longer tied onto a tree, and delight sprouted from his heart. Was it actually all a dream?He lowered his head to take a look.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +233 Rage!Zu An was starting to feel a little bad. At this rate, he felt that Plum Blossom Twelve would first bald from stress before even reaching his forties. \u201cDon\u2019t get too agitated. I helped you wrap up your wounds earlier. If it were to open up once more, even the deity wouldn\u2019t be able to save you anymore!\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve heard a voice coming from above him, and he looked upward. It was then that he noticed that he was currently at the bottom of a slope, and Zu An was squatting by the edge of the slope, looking down on him. He suddenly felt yet another gush of rage rushing up to his head as he bellowed, \u201cYou piece of shit! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +333 Rage!As he spoke, he began dashing up the slope. A sudden surge of pain coming from between his legs caused his eyes to redden. However, just as he was about to reach the top of the slope, a sudden kick sent him tumbling down once more.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +28 Rage!\u201cHow can this be!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve was shocked. He thought that he had only lost previously due to being caught off guard, but to think that he would be overpowered in a direct encounter too. Could Zu An\u2019s cultivation really be higher than him?\u201cI advise you to save up your strength. Otherwise, you won\u2019t have any energy to deal with the Assrip Wolves later on,\u201d Zu An reminded.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve was horrified. He suddenly heard low growls sounding from all around him. Following that, several Assrip Wolves caught the scent of blood and began gathering around him. It was then that he realized that he was in the midst of the Wolf Valley.\u201cFuckkkkkk!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +367 Rage!The first thought that came to Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s mind was to run up the slope. One must know that even though the Assrip Wolves were only in the second rank, there were over six of them right before him at this very moment. He wouldn\u2019t dare to provoke them even when he was in his peak condition, let alone the fact that he was severely injured now.Yet, who could have thought that Zu An was towering above him like an obstacle, adamantly blocking his path. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your strength. However, if you help me gather 10 goubaos, I\u2019ll pull you up.\u201dZu An finally got a look at the feared Assrip Wolves. They had black fur with white stripes on their back, though the fur around their stomach was yellowish-brown in color. Their ears were long and sharp. In terms of physique, they looked quite similar to the wolves in his previous life, but their size was comparable to that of a spotted hyena.\u201cYou bastard! You said that you\u2019ll let me off if I answered your questions earlier!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve gritted his teeth in fury.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +100 Rage!\u201cI only said that I\u2019ll consider it,\u201d Zu An replied indignantly.\u201cHow long more do you need to consider it?!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve no longer dared to turn his head around to look at Zu An anymore, fixing his eyes on the approaching Assrip Wolves instead. He knew better than to turn his back against a wild beast, or else he would be torn apart in the next instant.Zu An replied, \u201cI have already finished considering. I feel that it\u2019s too much of a pity to kill you right away, so I decided to squeeze dry whatever value you have left.\u201d He had never seen the Assrip Wolves before, so he didn\u2019t know how powerful they were. Thus, it was best to have Plum Blossom Twelve try them out first.Plum Blossom Twelve: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat sins did I commit in my previous life to encounter such a shameless fellow?You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +666 Rage!Zu An looked at the Rage he had accumulated in the system, and he felt truly impressed. This was much more than what he had earned from Chu Huanzhao back then.\u201cLife is very precious. Even if you have lost your treasure, there are still other joys in life that you can indulge in. Not everything has to be about sex.\u201d Zu An consoled Plum Blossom Twelve, hoping to give him some motivation. Otherwise, it would be troublesome for him if the latter gave up hope and chose to surrender without putting up a fight. \u201cHow about this? As long as you can obtain a single goubao, I\u2019ll save you right away!\u201dThose words moved Plum Blossom Twelve, but he couldn\u2019t help but think of how Zu An had reneged on his previous promise too.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Unless you write me a contract.\u201dHe looked so pitiful that it looked like he was going to cry anytime soon.\u201cWhere the hell am I going to find you paper?\u201d Zu An grumbled. \u201cHow about this instead? If I go against my words, for a month, I shall\u2026 Gah, that\u2019s not right. For three days, I won\u2019t be able to raise it up!\u201dZu An felt that since he was already suffering from such an illness, there was no harm in making such a promise. No matter how formidable Divine Physician Ji was, there is no way he could cure me in just a few days\u2019 time anyway\u2026 Aiyo, why do I feel like crying all of a sudden?Plum Blossom Twelve was overjoyed. One must know that the vows and contracts made in this world carried binding power, or else one would face the retribution of the world. Since Zu An dared to make such a promise, it did show that he was sincere about this. It was just that the duration was a little\u2026\u201cNo, that won\u2019t do. You must swear that your thing won\u2019t be able to raise up for an entire lifetime!\u201dZu An flew into a state of rage. \u201cScrew you! Think about just how beautiful my wife is! Isn\u2019t three days of being unable to touch her bad enough already? The most I\u2019ll go is seven days. No more haggling!\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve thought that Zu An\u2019s argument was extremely convincing. If he had a wife as beautiful as the First Miss of the Chu clan, he wouldn\u2019t even want to get off his bed anymore. It was already a vile curse for Zu An to be unable to rise up for seven days.Of course, the only reason why Plum Blossom Twelve thought this way was due to him not knowing that Zu An was forbidden from even entering the room of the First Miss.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s a deal then!\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve pulled himself back together as fighting spirit reignited in his eyes. If it was just retrieving a single goubao, it was not utterly hopeless for him. Once he got back into the city, he would have his godfather and his twelve other godbrothers exact vengeance for him. No matter what, he was determined to turn this repugnant fellow into minced meat!There were no kind-hearted souls amongst the Thirteen Guardians of Plum Blossom. Those who could climb up to this position were vicious and tenacious individuals. Plum Blossom Twelve tore the fabric around his sleeves to tie it around the wound at his crotch as viciousness flashed across his eyes.Meanwhile, the Assrip Wolves lost their patience and began their assault. Three of them charged at him from the front while the other three took a detour to assault him from his back.Watching this scene, Zu An felt a chill in his heart. The Assrip Wolves were much more agile than he had thought. Furthermore, their hides were fairly thick too. No matter what, Plum Blossom Twelve was still at the third step of the second rank, wielding enough power to shatter a normal tree with a single punch. Yet, these wolves simply let out a howl of pain before shrugging it off as if nothing had happened at all.\u201cDamn it! I\u2019m collecting goubaos for you, so can\u2019t you at least give my dagger back to me?\u201d After knocking an Assrip Wolf flying with a punch, Plum Blossom Twelve had to immediately turn around to protect his rear. He had to take note of so many enemies at once that he looked incredibly flustered.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +187 Rage!\u201cCatch it!\u201d Zu An shouted as he threw the dagger down. He wasn\u2019t really afraid of Plum Blossom Twelve suddenly charging up with the knife since the latter was currently encircled by 6 Assrip Wolves. It was impossible for him to shake them off and escape up the slope.Plum Blossom Twelve had to go through a lot of bloodshed and battles in order to climb to the position of the Thirteen Guardians. His moves weren\u2019t particularly profound, but every single one of them was practical in battle.While protecting his vitals, he took on some minor injuries in exchange for opportunities to deal heavy blows on the Assrip Wolves.\u201cAh, so the weakness of the Assrip Wolves is their waist.\u201d There were many chances that Plum Blossom Twelve could have decapitated the Assrip Wolves, but he chose not to do it. Instead, he kept looking for opportunities to plunge his dagger into their waist.These Assrip Wolves didn\u2019t appear to be too smart. With their combined strength, they could have easily curbed Plum Blossom Twelve if they had charged at him all at once. However, their instincts compelled them to circle behind Plum Blossom Twelve to rip his ass.Plum Blossom Twelve exploited this instinct of them to the fullest and successfully killed all six of them despite his severe injuries. However, he wasn\u2019t in a good state either. He was filled with wounds bitten by the Assrip Wolves, such that he didn\u2019t even have the strength to stand up at all. He simply sat on the floor while gasping for air.\u201cHurry up and pull me up!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve exclaimed. One of the Assrip Wolves had let out of howl right before its death. It was clearly calling out of its companions to summon them here. It wouldn\u2019t be long before more Assrip Wolves rushed over to the scene.\u201cYou haven\u2019t fulfilled our promise. Where\u2019s my goubao?\u201d Zu An squatted leisurely at the top as he asked.\u201cScrew you!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +78 Rage!Plum Blossom Twelve bellowed in fury. However, he dared not to waste any time. He quickly dissected the stomachs of the 6 Assrip Wolves. The overwhelming stench pouring out gagged him, but he bore with the odor and flipped through their stomachs.While fumbling around, he felt a hard, elliptical object, and his face lit up in joy. \u201cHahaha, I found it! I found it!\u201dAwoooo~However, the overpowering blood stench was like a lighthouse to the rest of the Assrip Wolves, attracting them over. This time, there was a wolf that was visibly larger than the others standing at the forefront, making it clear that it was the leader of the pack.\u201cHurry up and pull me up!\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve exclaimed in a panic.However, Zu An was in no hurry. He took his time pondering for a moment before ordering, \u201cThrow the goubao up first.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do. What if you renege on your promise after I throw it up?\u201d Plum Blossom Twelve was no fool either, so he wasn\u2019t willing to heed Zu An\u2019s demand.Zu An said, \u201cAre you questioning my character here? Didn\u2019t I make a vow earlier? Hurry up and throw it up. If you continue dilly-dallying, the other Assrip Wolves will be here before you know it.\u201dFrom Zu An\u2019s vantage point, he could see Assrip Wolves dashing over, and it was likely that they would arrive in less than a minute\u2019s time. Left with no choice, Plum Blossom Twelve could only toss the goubao up first.\u201cQuick, pull me up!\u201dAfter keeping the goubao into his bag, he slowly grabbed the rope which he had used to tie Plum Blossom Twelve earlier on and tossed it down. \u201cGrab it.\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve tried grabbing the rope, only to find that it was several meters away from the ground. He couldn\u2019t reach it even if he jumped up. This left him both frightened and infuriated. \u201cYou are toying with me?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +144 Rage!\u201cAh!\u201d Zu An exclaimed in astonishment. \u201cHow am I to know that the rope is only this long? You should have prepared a longer rope in case a situation like this occurs!\u201dPlum Blossom Twelve was on the verge of losing his mind from anger. \u201cCan\u2019t you just come down a little?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +500 Rage!Zu An shook his head vehemently. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid of those Assrip Wolves. What if I slip down?\u201dAfter all that was said and done, it was clear as day to Plum Blossom Twelve that Zu An had no intention of saving him. \u201cYou swore on it! Do you know the consequences of breaking your promises?\u201dZu An shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cI only vowed to save you, but I didn\u2019t say that I\u2019ll successfully save you. I already did my part. You\u2019re the one who can\u2019t reach the rope, and you\u2019re blaming me for it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before he died, he let out a vicious curse.\u201cYou won\u2019t\u2026 won\u2019t die a\u2026 good death\u2026!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Twelve for +1000 Rage!Plum Blossom Twelve probably never expected that he would be saying the exact same words that Brother Tan did two hours ago.\u201cWho was the one who said that only the weak bark insults?\u201d Zu An sighed deeply to himself. Looking at the bloodied scene below, he felt a chill running down his spine. He couldn\u2019t take the gore, so he quickly turned around and left the area.He needed to gather 10 goubaos, but he only had one so far. How was he going to gather the other 9?It wouldn\u2019t be wise to do it forcefully. Plum Blossom Twelve had put his life on the line, only to kill 6 of them before caving in. Zu An didn\u2019t think that someone like him, who had just started cultivating, could possibly compete with him.Furthermore, the leader of the Assrip Wolves appeared to be at the third rank. Even in a one-on-one, Zu An wouldn\u2019t be a match for him, let alone in a many-on-one battle.If it had been any other wild beasts, Zu An might have still considered trying it out considering that he had the Poisonous Prick and the Poison Bottle. However, after watching how Plum Blossom Twelve got his ass wrecked by them, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little frightened.I should try drawing the lottery. Maybe I can get something useful in order to deal with those Assrip Wolves.Zu An brought out his keyboard, and to his astonishment, the Rage points he had accumulated was a hulking 7220! The greatest contributor of all was indubitably Plum Blossom Twelve.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but find it a pity that the other party was already dead. It would have been good if he could continue squeezing out more Rage from him.If Plum Blossom Twelve knew that the only motivation Zu An had to save him was to squeeze Rage points out of him, he would probably die of anger once more.Looking at the lottery interface in front of him, Zu An found himself trembling in anticipation.He hit the enter button, and the light eventually landed on an empty keycap.Thanks for playing!Zu An\u2019s face darkened. He was just about to continue on when he suddenly recalled something. Wait a moment, did I forget one of the key steps?Ah! I didn\u2019t wash my face!So, Zu An quickly halted his lottery drawing and rushed back. He remembered passing by a stream on his way here.There was no statistical evidence to back up his superstition that washing his face could increase his chances of striking the lottery, but still, the ritual itself felt reassuring to him.Thus, he went to the riverside and washed his face thoroughly. He made sure to scrub his hands too before turning his attention back to the lottery.He hit the enter key, and the light began flickering across the keyboard. In the end, it stopped on the number \u20180\u2019. A crimson pill floated out\u2014Marrow Cleansing Pill!Zu An leaped up in excitement. See! I knew washing my face helped!Making full use of his current outburst of luck, he quickly drew the lottery once more, and it was yet another Marrow Cleansing Pill. His smile became so wide that he could barely conceal his happiness.Thanks for playing\u2026 Thanks for playing\u2026Ding! It was another number \u20180\u2019, Marrow Cleansing Pill!When Zu An drew the Marrow Cleansing Pill for the fourth time, his smile began to fade. He wondered if the only thing he was going to get was Marrow Cleansing Pills.Thanks for playing\u2026 Thanks for playing\u2026After playing for another dozen times, the item he got was still Marrow Cleansing Pills!Before Zu An could retort about this, he heard a voice notification coming from the keyboard.\u201cIn view that the user has obtained sufficient Marrow Cleansing Pills to raise your talent to the maximum, Marrow Cleansing Pills will no longer appear in the list of rewards. The Shop function will be opened. The user may purchase Marrow Cleansing Pills in the Shop in the future.\u201cA new reward will be allocated to keycap \u20180\u2019. Please look forward to it.\u201dBlack streaks flashed across Zu An\u2019s face. Why can\u2019t you just tell me what the new reward is instead of telling me to look forward to it? Look forward to it, my ass!After retorting to the system\u2019s notification, Zu An began exploring the new \u2018Shop\u2019 command. On his screen, there was an additional icon that looked like a merchant. However, when he tapped into it, there was only a single good there\u2014Marrow Cleansing Pills!However, what was even shocking was that every single one of it cost 10,000 Rage points!This isn\u2019t right! Zu An recalled the last few times that he drew the lottery. Even though there were times that his luck was down, on average, he was still able to get something decent roughly every ten pulls. Judging by that, the item in the shop was actually ten times more expensive than the lottery!This is a scam!But thinking back, the shops in the games he played in his previous life were also somewhat similar to this. They always sold items at a premium price, only to buy them back at a discounted price. Going by that logic, it was not entirely incomprehensible for the Marrow Cleansing Pill in the shop to be so expensive.I won\u2019t need it anyway.Recalling the earlier notification informing him that he had already acquired sufficient Marrow Cleansing Pills to raise his talent to the maximum, there was no way Zu An would waste his Rage to purchase them from the shop.He still had 3000 Rage left at the moment. For the time being, he decided to consume the Marrow Cleansing Pills first before continuing on. This was the only way that he could put his mind at ease. Besides, there was no saying that his luck might just rise together with his talent.From his previous experience, Chu Feng knew that consuming the Marrow Cleansing Pill would force out the impurities in his body, cloaking him in a layer of dirty gunge. He was currently out in the wilderness with no spare clothes on hand, so he chose to take off his clothes first before swallowing a Marrow Cleansing Pill.He made sure to fully assimilate the medicinal energy of the first pill fully before moving on to consume the second one. As a keyboard warrior, it was imperative for him to proceed carefully. If he were to consume all of the Marrow Cleansing Pills at once, wouldn\u2019t his weak body blow up if he couldn\u2019t withstand the sudden influx of medicinal energy? That would be a ridiculous reason to die for!Gradually, Zu An felt his body growing warmer and warmer, and impurities began seeping out from his pores at a visible pace. He quickly leaped into the water to wash them away so as to avoid disgusting himself from the accumulation of gunge.However, when he consumed the last Marrow Cleansing Pill, he realized that he had still underestimated the medicinal energy they contained. It was still comfortable at the start, but the heat inside his body continued growing more and more intense, as if his cells were being broken down and reconstructed. He felt like his bones, muscles, and skin were going to burst apart.\u201cShit!\u201d Fear arose from Zu An\u2019s heart. Before he knew it, the intense pain had already knocked him out.A long time later, Zu An woke up once more, only to find that he was still in the water. He was lying over a huge boulder by the side of the river. His surroundings looked a bit foreign; it seemed like he had floated quite a distance away while he was knocked out.\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that I wasn\u2019t eaten by piranhas while I was knocked out,\u201d Zu An muttered as he began inspecting his body. He felt relieved to see that his limbs and everything else was still attached properly.The intense pain from earlier had vanished without a trace, replaced by a feeling of lightness and vigor. He could clearly sense that something was different about his body, but he couldn\u2019t exactly point out what it was.He took a deep breath of air, and it tasted exceptionally sweet.\u201cHm? The third formation has been filled up too?\u201dThe golden stuff inside the third formation was still a little off from being completely filled previously, so strictly speaking, he had only truly reached the third step of rank two at this moment.Looks like talent really makes a huge difference. The golden stuff inside the formation grows slowly just by me breathing.Zu An was curious to know just what his current talent was. He was at lower Ding previously, which was basically equivalent to D-. Assuming that each Marrow Cleansing Pill increased his talent by a single rank, given that he had eaten 5 Marrow Cleansing Pills, it should have risen to D, D+, C-, C, and finally, C+.No, that\u2019s not right. The keyboard has notified me earlier that my talent has reached the maximum level, so each Marrow Cleansing Pill should go beyond just increasing my talent by a single rank. Shouldn\u2019t my talent currently be A+ or S?Or could there be a S+ above S?I wonder what the highest level of talent in this world is. Looks like I\u2019ll have to slowly figure it out in the future.Zu An looked at his surroundings, and the world was very different from before. He could see the tree leaves rustling in the wind, a butterfly fluttering its wings, an ant moving its antlers, a beautiful woman slowly raising her head from the water, the fishes in the water chasing prawns\u2026Hm, something is wrong here?Zu An quickly turned around, only to see a young woman several meters away. Due to his body being blocked behind the big boulder, as well as the fact that he was unconscious earlier, neither of them had noticed each other yet.The young woman was standing upright, revealing her slender and delicate shoulders, as well as the fair, smooth skin covering her chest. She was humming a leisurely tune that sounded as pleasant as an oriole\u2019s song.She lifted her fair arms, and water began trickling down her arms and down to her chest. Due to Zu An\u2019s enhanced senses, he could even clearly see the water droplets hanging on her eyelashes. It made her eyes look even more alluring.Gulu~Zu An gulped down a mouthful of saliva. Could it be that the enhancement of his talent had boosted his luck with girls too?\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dThe noise Zu An made alarmed the young woman.Zu An subconsciously hid behind the boulder. He had no other choice, for it had just dawned upon him that he was in a dangerous situation here. Had it been in his previous life, it would have probably just ended up with him getting lectured. However, this was the world of cultivation! There was no way a person who was bathing in the midst of the wilderness was an ordinary human!One must know that Zu An\u2019s cultivation level was still at the bare bottom, so there was a good chance that the woman was far stronger than him.If she was a vicious and unforgiving person, there was a chance that Zu An would end in the same fate as Plum Blossom Twelve.\u201cMiss, will you believe me if I said that I was just passing by the area?\u201d Zu An knew that it was too late for him to hide now. It was best for him to quickly clarify the situation and express that it was all a coincidence.\u201cW-who are you?\u201d The young woman sounded flustered.Hm? This lady seems to be on the shyer side.Zu An quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019m here to gather medicine, but I was chased by wild beasts earlier and ended up falling into the river. I lost my consciousness along the way, and before I knew it, I was already here.\u201d\u201cMedicine? What kind of medicine were you gathering?\u201d The young woman asked from the other side of the boulder. Clearly, she was also planning on using the boulder to conceal her body too.Zu An was a little taken aback. Aren\u2019t you focusing on the wrong thing here? Is the important thing here what medicine I\u2019m gathering?Nevertheless, Zu An still replied politely, \u201cI\u2019m gathering goubaos.\u201d As it hadn\u2019t been long since he came to this world, this was the only medicine that he knew about.\u201cThe wild beasts who chased you were the Assrip Wolves?\u201d the young woman asked softly.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Zu An replied. He was surprised by how knowledgeable this woman was despite her young age.\u201cThe Wolf Valley is indeed not too far away from here. Since you dared to gather goubaos, you must be quite a powerful cultivator then?\u201d the young woman asked.Zu An replied with a sheepish smile, \u201cYou can say so, I guess.\u201d While others were wolves cloaked in sheepskin, he was a sheep cloaked in wolfskin. If he didn\u2019t want to be killed out here, he had no choice but to do this.The young woman replied with a trailing \u201cOh\u2026\u201d before falling silent. A long time later, she finally spoke up once more, \u201cI\u2019m heading up now to wear my clothes. Can you\u2026 close your eyes?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An was delighted to hear those words. After worrying about this all this while, it turned out that this young woman was a fairly agreeable person. This would make it much easier for him to handle this situation.\u201cI understand,\u201d Zu An replied.He heard the sound of someone rising from the water, and his thoughts began flying around the place. There was a problem that was sitting right before him right now\u2014should he take a peek? It was a choice of either becoming a beast or becoming less than a beast.Just imagining the young woman\u2019s smooth jadelike body rising from the water left his nose feeling a little warm. When he reached out to touch his nose, he realized that it was red.Holy shit, I\u2019m bleeding!It seemed like the Marrow Cleansing Pills had really boosted the yang energy in his feeble body considerably.\u201cAhh~\u201dThe young woman suddenly shouted in horror, alarming Zu An. He wondered if it was the kind of plot where she got bitten by a venomous snake or something. If so, he didn\u2019t mind sacrificing himself to suck the venom out for her.In the next moment, however, his face warped in horror too. He felt the ground around him tremoring, as if a train was heading in his direction.\u201cRun!\u201dA cold but soft hand grabbed Zu An\u2019s arm and pulled him toward the center of the river. Shortly after, the massive boulder Zu An was hiding behind shattered into innumerable pieces. A humongous beast came into appearance, and it bellowed at the duo inside the water.\u201cIs that a rhinoceros?\u201d Zu An was astonished. The rhinoceros was almost as big as an elephant! Did the animals in this world grow up eating steroids or something? Besides, why were its eyes so red? It was almost as if it was afflicted with mad cow disease or something!\u201cIts name is Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino, a fourth rank beast. It has a poor sense of smell and a horrible temper. It has the habit of attacking any living beings in sight,\u201d a tender voice explained beside him.Zu An turned his head over and saw the young woman\u2019s appearance. She had straight bangs that covered her forehead, and there were a few strands of hair hanging loosely by the sides of her face, which further highlighted her small face. She had clear peach blossom eyes that went well with her fair complexion. On the whole, she gave off an air of youthfulness.However, what was more important was that she hadn\u2019t worn her clothes yet.Noticing Zu An\u2019s gaze, the young woman lowered her head before exclaiming with a loud \u2018Ah!\u2019, which only seemed to further infuriate the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino standing by the river bank.\u201cTurn over, turn over!\u201d the young woman exclaimed tearfully.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, I\u2019ll turn over right now!\u201d Zu An quickly turned his head over. For some reason, the young woman\u2019s soft and gentle voice left him unable to form any sinful thoughts about her\u2026 But of course, considering the current state his body was in, it would be weird if he could carry any sinful thoughts toward her.The young woman quickly placed her arms around her chests before muttering softly, \u201cThank you.\u201dZu An asked, \u201cWhere are your clothes?\u201d\u201cT-they are still by the shore.\u201dThe young woman spoke shyly as she raised her slender arm and pointed to the area near the shattered boulder.\u201cWhat if the Crazy Rhino doesn\u2019t leave the area? Shall we try knocking it down?\u201d Zu An asked with the intention of probing out the young woman\u2019s cultivation.However, considering that a fourth rank rhinoceros was able to scare her to such an extent, it didn\u2019t seem like she was very strong.\u201cRed-Eyes Crazy Rhino has extremely thick skin. Even cultivators of the fourth rank will find it hard to hurt it,\u201d the young woman replied with a shake of her head.\u201cI think that we can still give it a try,\u201d Zu An said. The Poisonous Prick should be particularly effective against enemies who boasted high defense but low attack power and speed. He could make use of this opportunity to feign as an expert and intimidate her, so that she wouldn\u2019t pursue the earlier matter anymore.\u201cT-there\u2019s no need for it. It\u2019ll be fine very soon,\u201d the young woman replied.\u201c???\u201dWhile Zu An was trying to figure out what the young woman meant, the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino suddenly swayed from side to side, as if intoxicated. Its footsteps grew a little erratic, and a short moment later, it suddenly collapsed to the floor.\u201cYou were the one who did it?\u201d Zu An felt his throat drying up, and he swallowed his saliva. Was this young woman just feigning weakness?The young woman replied with a nod, \u201cI put some medicine on the boulder earlier. The rhino rammed into it earlier, which led to it breathing in the medicine.\u201d\u201cWhat medicine is so potent as to even knock out such a huge rhino?\u201d Zu An was rendered speechless. However, he soon noticed that there was something else amiss too. \u201cWhy did you put medicine on the boulder?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I was worried\u2026\u201d the young woman stuttered as her voice grew softer and softer. \u201cI was worried that\u2026 you would peek. However, you don\u2019t need to worry. It\u2019s just sedatives! It isn\u2019t dangerous!\u201dZu An took a sharp intake of breath. If that medicine was potent enough to even knock out that huge rhino so quickly, if he had tried to peek earlier, there was a good chance that he would have slept for a month straight!\u201cCan you close your eyes now? I\u2019m going to get dressed\u2026\u201d the young woman said timidly, as if she was making an overboard request out of him.\u201cOf course,\u201d Zu An replied. Unlike in dramas, there were neither infuriated insults of \u2018You lecher\u2019 nor attempts on his life. There was just embarrassment lingering in the air. Were young women in this world all so adorable?However, when he thought about the sharp-tongued Snow, he quickly dispelled his thoughts.Meanwhile, seeing that Zu An had really closed his eyes, the young woman began swimming toward the shore.Hearing the splashing of water, a small crack opened in Zu An\u2019s tightly shut eyes. His eyes had suffered so much for so many years, and it was finally time to reward them a little.He watched as the young woman swam beautifully like a mermaid, her figure vaguely visible through the water.When she finally got to the shore, Zu An\u2019s heart suddenly began beating in anticipation. She was going to wear her clothes now!Unexpectedly, the young woman suddenly raised her hand, and a wall of water rose into the sky, concealing her body.Zu An immediately flew into a state of rage, \u201cWho are you guarding against? Am I that kind of person?!\u201dA short moment later, the wall of water finally fell back down. The young woman had finally finished dressing herself up. She turned to the center of the river and waved her hand, saying, \u201cI have finished wearing my clothes. You may open your eyes now.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Zu An replied as he thought that this young woman really had a lack of awareness.He swam toward the shore, and when he finally got a good look at the young woman, his eyes lit up. She was wearing a blue dress with a white lace tied around her waist, which accentuated her slender figure.She looked at Zu An with blinking large eyes, almost as if a doll. For a moment there, Zu An felt a little dazed. He thought that he was looking at Asuka Saito!However, Zu An swiftly noticed yet another awkward situation\u2014his clothes weren\u2019t with him!\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you getting up?\u201d The young woman shot a look at the guy in the water before quickly averting his gaze with reddened cheeks.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you earlier that I was knocked out and ended up being washed here? I also don\u2019t know where my clothes are,\u201d Zu An said.The young woman pondered for a while before saying, \u201cSince you were washed downstream by the river, it\u2019s likely that your clothes are up there.\u201d\u201cCan you accompany me there? I\u2019m a little afraid to go on my own.\u201d Human relationships were like a rubber band. If one side loosened up, the other side would tighten up. Initially, Zu An was worried about getting killed by her, but after seeing her shy personality, he couldn\u2019t help but feel an urge to bully her.The young woman pondered for a moment before finally nodding in agreement. \u201cAlright. Actually, you don\u2019t need to worry about it. There aren\u2019t many wild beasts near the river. Of course, when evening comes, there would still be quite a few wild beasts coming down here to have a sip of water. However, as long as you don\u2019t provoke the Fiery Wolves from the Wolf Valley, there shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s with this rhino?\u201d Zu An examined the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino from close proximity, and he was deeply awed by just how huge it was.The young woman\u2019s face reddened. \u201cActually, it followed me down from the Hidden Dragon Mountain.\u201dZu An was shocked. \u201cYou entered the Hidden Dragon Mountain?\u201d Even by thinking with his toes, he knew that there were many powerful beasts hiding there. He had heard countless warnings from all sorts of people to never enter the mountain. Yet, this young woman entered the mountain all alone? Didn\u2019t that mean that she was actually very powerful?Zu An was starting to regret his decision. Was he actually courting his own death here?\u201cIndeed. There are some herbs that can only be found in the depths of the Hidden Dragon Mountain.\u201d The young woman put her hands into the straps of the basket containing medicine and lifted it up. With a pure smile, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll retrieve your clothes with you.\u201d\u201cThank you, miss.\u201d Zu An swam in the water. \u201cRight! My name is Zu An. May I know what your name is?\u201d Upon learning that the young woman was actually a powerful expert, he thought of getting in close relations with her.\u201cZu An? What a peculiar name,\u201d the young woman muttered to herself before answering his question. \u201cMy name is Ji Xiaoxi.\u201dZu An chuckled. \u201cYour name sounds much nicer than mine.\u201dThe young woman\u2019s face reddened in embarrassment.Seeing this, Zu An verified that she did have a weak personality, and that emboldened him a little. \u201cXiaoxi, if you\u2019re harvesting medicine in the Hidden Dragon Mountain, doesn\u2019t that mean that you\u2019re quite a powerful expert?\u201dJi Xiaoxi shook her head, replying unguardedly, \u201cI\u2019m only at the third rank. The only reason why I can enter the mountain is due to the item my father gave me.\u201dAs she spoke, she took out a transparent bottle containing bits of green powder.Zu An was perplexed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dJi Xiaoxi replied, \u201cIt is a medicine made out of dried dragon feces. It carries the natural pressure that dragons command, thus keeping the wild beasts in the mountain at bay.\u201dZu An was astonished. To think the dragons really existed in this world!Ji Xiaoxi kept her bottle properly before muttering with a pout, \u201cIt\u2019s just that this thing is too smelly, so I would usually bathe and change my clothes after getting out of the mountain. I didn\u2019t expect to\u2026 bump into you.\u201d\u201cThis is just how fate works.\u201d Zu An chuckled. Seeing the hint of frustration on the young woman\u2019s forehead, he quickly changed the topic. \u201cWait a moment. If that\u2019s the case, why did the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino attack you earlier then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because its senses are lacking,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi explained. \u201cThe Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino cannot smell the dragon feces, so it doesn\u2019t fear it. Furthermore, it\u2019s an extremely vindictive creature. I accidentally provoked it while I was passing by its territory, so it chased me all the way down here.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Zu An nodded in realization. Recalling the physique of the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino, an idea suddenly came to his mind.The two of them continued chatting while heading upstream, and soon, they returned back to where Zu An was at the start. His clothes were still folded neatly on the spot.\u201cXiaoxi, can you turn around?\u201d In truth, Zu An didn\u2019t mind being seen, but he didn\u2019t want to be viewed as a pervert.Ji Xiaoxi replied with a \u201cMm\u2019 as she ran all the way behind a tree. Zu An quickly got on shore and wore his clothes. He confirmed that his goubao and the silver taels he obtained from Plum Blossom Twelve was still around before heaving a sigh of relief.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m done changing,\u201d Zu An shouted over.Ji Xiaoxi finally walked out of the tree. Upon taking a closer look at Zu An, she fell into a daze.Surprised by her reaction, Zu An touched his own face and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something weird about me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Ji Xiaoxi quickly averted her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you\u2019re that good-looking.\u201d She was too embarrassed to look at him properly earlier in the water, so it was only now that she finally caught a good glimpse of his appearance.\u201cIndeed. Back in my hometown, my family and friends tend to call me Sanlitun\u2019s Daniel Wu.\u201d Zu An was more than delighted to be acknowledged by a beauty. When he heard Cheng Shouping mention that the First Miss of the Chu clan had brought him in as her wife was due to his looks, he thought that it was just bootlicking. However, now that he looked at it again, it seemed like his looks were indeed considered outstanding in this world.\u201cWho is Daniel Wu?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi asked in confusion.\u201cAh, he\u2019s one of the best-looking men back in my hometown,\u201d Zu An replied as he began to reminisce about his other world. He missed his handphone and internet, and the boredom of having nothing to do really grated at him.\u201cOh.\u201d Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s face reddened a little. All of a sudden, she said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t a good person.\u201d\u201cAh? Why is that so?\u201d Zu An was astonished. While the young woman was a little naive, there was no doubt that she was stronger than him in terms of strength. If she were to turn against him right now, it would pose quite a bit of trouble to him.\u201cYou said that the Assrip Wolves were chasing you, and it was in a moment of fluster that you fell into the water. However, when I took a look around the area, there are no traces of Assrip Wolves around. Furthermore, your clothes are folded neatly on the shore, which shows that you entered the water in a relaxed manner. The situation is definitely different from how you depicted it to be,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi said as she pointed to the marks on the ground. She was naive, but she wasn\u2019t a fool.Zu An laughed in embarrassment. However, the time they spent chatting with one another earlier had given him a good grasp of her personality, so he quickly explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I want to lie to you, but I was afraid that you would misunderstand, especially given the situation then. That\u2019s why I spun up that excuse. However, it\u2019s true that I lost consciousness and ended up being swept there. I assure you that I wasn\u2019t lying about that.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi assessed him suspiciously from head to toe. \u201cYou seem to be in perfect condition though. You don\u2019t appear to be ill to me. Give me your hand.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zu An was a little perplexed, but the young woman had a disposition that made it hard for anyone to turn down her request. He subconsciously obeyed her and stretched his hand out.Three icy fingers fell on his pulse, and at that moment, Ji Xiaoxi seemed to have turned into a different person. Her gentle and tender atmosphere suddenly turned severe and inviolable.Even a chatterbox like Zu An found himself not daring to say anything out of fear of interrupting her.\u201cI see. There\u2019s indeed a problem with your Sea of Yin Pulse,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi retracted her fingers as she said. Her wariness toward him alleviated slightly, and it was replaced with pity instead. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I am unable to treat you due to my lacking skills. However, you need not worry. My father should be able to do it.\u201dSeeing the young woman eyeing the lower half of his body with a look of sympathy, Zu An felt tears brimming in his eyes. Which man would be willing to show his weak side to a woman? He was still thinking of teasing her a little, but now that his problem was completely seen through by her\u2026 How embarrassing!Zu An felt deeply regretful. He shouldn\u2019t have given his arm to her so obediently. But again, how was he to know that this young woman was actually such a capable physician?Wait a moment, her surname is Ji, and she\u2019s skilled in medicine too. It can\u2019t be that coincidental, right?Zu An tried asking, \u201cMay I ask who your father is?\u201dJi Xiaoxi replied with a sweet smile, \u201cMy father is Ji Dengtu. He has quite some fame in Brightmoon City, so you might have heard of him.\u201d She was initially guarded against him, but after learning of his illness, she put her wariness away. She believed that the earlier peeking incident was indeed an unintended coincidence.\u201cAh, Divine Physician Ji. I have heard of him,\u201d Zu An replied. After some thought, he decided not to tell her that the reason behind his trip here was due to the task allocated by Divine Physician Ji.\u201cYou need not worry too much about it. I\u2019ll bring you home to meet my father. He should have a way to treat your illness.\u201d Seeing the slightly out-of-it look on Zu An\u2019s face, Ji Xiaoxi thought that he was worrying about his illness, so she quickly consoled him.\u201cBut I still need to collect goubaos.\u201d Zu An was a little skeptical at Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s offer to help. He had seen just how much Divine Physician Ji loved his money, and he had put down his daughter unhesitatingly in public too. It was hard to believe that a person like that would help him if he didn\u2019t complete his task.Hearing Zu An\u2019s words, Ji Xiaoxi hesitated a little before saying, \u201cBut given your strength, I\u2019m afraid that\u2026\u201dHer meaning was extremely clear. It\u2019s not that I want to look down on you, but your strength is indeed trash.Zu An chuckled in response. \u201cI was indeed feeling a little troubled by this matter, but I figured a way out after meeting you.\u201d\u201cAfter meeting me?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi appeared to be put in a spot too. \u201cBut I\u2019m only at the third rank. If I use the dragon feces, those Assrip Wolves would only stay as far away as possible. As for the sedative, I\u2019ve already used up all of them to deal with the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino.\u201dZu An felt that it was a miracle that this young woman could live till this day. She actually gave away all of her trump cards to a stranger without any hesitation. Had she never contemplated the possibility that he could possibly be a bad person?But thinking deeper into it, it could be because she knew the affliction he was suffering from that she was able to put down her guard against him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t need your help. I can settle this by myself,\u201d Zu An replied with a secretive smile. \u201cYou mentioned earlier that the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino is vindictive?\u201d\u201cIndeed,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi replied with a nod. It was then that her eyes widened in realization. \u201cYou\u2019re intending to use the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino to deal with those Assrip Wolves? Even though the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino has thick skin, its speed is far from a match for those Assrip Wolves. It\u2019ll be hard for it to kill them. Besides, the leader of the Assrip Wolves appears to have already reached the third rank. In a real fight, I\u2019m afraid that the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino wouldn\u2019t be a match for them.\u201d\u201cI have an idea in mind.\u201d Zu An replied with a mysterious smile as he began making his way downstream. The perplexed Ji Xiaoxi quickly followed him too.The two of them returned back to the shore and saw that the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was already starting to rouse from its sleep. As potent as Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s sedative was, its amount wasn\u2019t enough to knock out this massive beast for too long.Zu An quickly turned to Ji Xiaoxi and asked, \u201cDo you have a handkerchief?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d Ji Xiaoxi subconsciously took out a clean white handkerchief and passed it to him.Smelling the light fragrance of an orchid coming from it, Zu An hesitated for a little before asking, \u201cDo you have one that is used? It\u2019ll be a pity to dirty this one.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just wash it afterward.\u201d Ji Xiaoxi waved her hand casually.Zu An thought that she probably wouldn\u2019t want to wash it by the end of it, but he chose to swallow those words back down. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll owe you a handkerchief then. I\u2019ll buy you a new one when we get back to the city.\u201dAfter saying those words, Zu An took out the Poisonous Prick and covered it tightly with the handkerchief, revealing just the tip of it.Ji Xiaoxi was confused. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cStand a bit farther away,\u201d Zu An said without explaining. After Ji Xiaoxi was finally hiding by the side, he walked up to the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino. While holding the Crazy Rhino\u2019s tail with one hand, he used the other to push the entire dagger up into the rhino\u2019s ass.\u201c???\u201dYou have successfully trolled Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino for +2 +2 +2 +2\u2026Zu An was surprised. Perhaps it was because these wild beasts lacked intelligence, that\u2019s why the Rage points they produced was much less as compared to humans.The Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was initially still a bit giddy, but the abrupt insertion of a foreign object into its rear jolted it awake right away. It rose to its feet and hurriedly turned to its back to take a look. However, its body was simply too inconveniently bulky that despite turning many rounds, it was unable to figure out what had happened to its rear.It was then that a whistle sounded not too far away. A human was waving its hands to it, and this infuriated the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino. It figured that this human must have been the shameless culprit who dared make a move against its rear!Its eyes grew redder and redder, and a breath of white smoke snorted out from its nose. It began charging forward like a frenzied bull.Seeing that he had successfully caught the rhinoceros\u2019 aggro, he immediately turned tail and took flight.Meanwhile, Ji Xiaoxi watched the human-and-rhino chase by the side with a flabbergasted look on her face. \u201cThis is the idea he has in mind? It feels\u2026 disgusting.\u201dHowever, she was still worried about Zu An\u2019s safety, so she quickly chased after him.Fortunately, even though the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was at the fourth rank, its bulky body and powerful defense were offset by its lack in speed. Despite it chasing after Zu An with all of its might, it was unable to close the distance.The chase continued all the way till the borders of the Wolf Valley. The Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino suddenly halted its footsteps right before the entrance. It was aware that it was about to enter the territory of the Assrip Wolves, and its instincts compelled it to stop its footsteps.Seeing this, Zu An turned around and shouted at it, \u201cHey, big oaf! How does it feel to have your ass busted? Don\u2019t you want to get revenge? I guess your mum wasted her effort giving birth to a big lump of trash like you!\u201dThe Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino didn\u2019t understand human speech, but it knew that the human was definitely insulting it. Recalling the insolent act of aggression the human had done to it earlier, its eyes began burning with rage as it charged forward once more.Who cares about the Assrip Wolves? My skin is tough enough anyway, so the bites of those lousy dogs can\u2019t hope to do anything at allYou have successfully trolled Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino for +2 +2 +2 +2\u2026On the other hand, Zu An laughed arrogantly as he led it straight toward the den of the Assrip Wolves.The Assrip Wolves had just finished their meal and were lying lazily on the ground. It was a huge pity that the human from earlier on was too skinny, such that it wasn\u2019t enough to share amongst their hundred wolf brothers.Starvation was actually not the worst feeling in the world. The worst feeling was to be only given a bite while one was starving; that only worsened the feeling of deprivation!All of a sudden, the leader of the Assrip Wolves pricked up its ears. He could sense the ground tremoring. Could it be that some massive fellow had just entered their territory?Awooooooo~The leader of the Assrip Wolves immediately gathered its people in preparation to deal with the intruder.\u201cHmm, another human has barged in here?\u201dThe leader of the Assrip Wolves was a little perplexed. Were humans that fearless nowadays? That being said, it was not as if it would turn down food that was delivered right at its doorstep.So, it immediately ordered all of its subordinates to encircle the human.Seeing that the Assrip Wolves were starting to make a move, Zu An hurriedly did a u-turn and ran out of the Wolf Valley. On the other hand, the less agile Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino had a much harder time doing that. The sheer momentum built up by its massive body made it impossible for it to brake swiftly, so it ended up ramming all the way into the den of the Assrip Wolves.The sudden appearance of the massive rhino caught the Assrip Wolves off guard. They quickly hurriedly scattered around the area to avoid the impact, but there were a few of them who failed to dodge in time and ended up being violently rammed down.This abrupt intrusion of the massive rhino infuriated the leader of the Assrip Wolves. If the enemy was a fifth rank beast, it would have swallowed its anger and tolerated it. However, the rhino was a mere fourth rank beast, not to mention that it was a dumb oaf who couldn\u2019t even move its body properly! There was no way it would fear such an enemy!Awoooooo~The leader immediately ordered its pack to let the human go and focus on the rhino. That human had barely any meat on him whereas this rhino was enough to feed them for at least ten days. It was obvious which prey it would choose to hunt down.So, the Assrip Wolves rushed toward the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino to bite down on its rear. Some of the more daring ones even leaped onto its back and clamped its fangs down.However, the thick skin of the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was no joke either. Instead of hurting it, the wolves who tried to bite down on it nearly shattered its teeth instead. Despite having no sustained any injuries, the Crazy Rhino grew infuriated from the aggression of the Assrip Wolves. It turned around and rammed them down, crushing their bodies.After the deed was done, it opened its mouth smugly, mocking the wolves for not knowing their place.Awooo~That, in turn, provoked the leader of the Assrip Wolves. It raised its head toward the sky and howled out loud, sending a reminder to its subordinates.\u201cAre you all idiots? Have you forgotten what our specialty is? Wreck his ass!\u201d[1] Daniel Wu is considered to be one of the most good-looking male stars in China back in 1990s-2000s, kind of equivalent to Tom Cruise I guess.

    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaytUpon receiving the orders, the Assrip Wolves finally recovered their senses and changed their strategy. Aside from leaving some targets in front to distract the Crazy Rhino, the rest of the pack circled to its back to bite down on its ass.This left the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino seething in rage. Why is everyone attacking my ass today?!?! The Crazy Rhino was blessed with tough coppery skin which the Assrip Wolves couldn\u2019t bite through even if it were to stand still. However, there was no way its ass could have the same defensive prowess as the rest of its body. It was no exaggeration to say that it was its softest part of its entire body.The Crazy Rhino tried its best to ram these disgusting wolves down, but its agility was simply too low as compared to these Assrip Wolves. Every single one of its charges landed empty. After dozens of attempts, it was left panting heavily, and its head was spinning from overexertion.Meanwhile, the Assrip Wolves realized that the time was ripe for a counterattack. Thus, from probing the enemy, they began launching an all-out attack against the Crazy Rhino\u2019s ass.This panicked the Crazy Rhino. I really shouldn\u2019t have come to this darned place. It\u2019s all that damned human\u2019s fault!You have successfully trolled Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino for +2 +2 +2 +2\u2026As furious as it was, it wouldn\u2019t hesitate to run when it was the time to do so. It immediately turned tail and began charging out of the den. However, there was no way the Assrip Wolves would let several days of meal that was already delivered to their doorstep get away. They swiftly rushed forward to block its path.Ji Xiaoxi had been spectating the fight from the top of the slope, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel that the Crazy Rhino was a little pitiful. \u201cThe Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino is simply at far too much of a disadvantage against the Assrip Wolves. If it was any other wild beasts with higher offensive prowess and agility, the Assrip Wolves would have definitely not been a match.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t that Crazy Rhino bully you earlier? I\u2019ll take revenge for you.\u201d Zu An spewed out a lie without any hesitation.\u201cBut it\u2019s so pitiful!\u201d Ji Xiaoxi exclaimed. \u201cIt looks like it won\u2019t last long. Should we save it?\u201dZu An quickly grabbed her arm to stop her from doing anything. There were two things in his mind right now, \u2018Ji Xiaoxi really has too much sympathy in her that she\u2019ll definitely get exploited by people in the future\u2019 and \u2018Wow, her arm is so soft\u2019. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t die that easily. Just continue watching.\u201dJi Xiaoxi was skeptical of what Zu An had just said, but she decided to continue watching the scene. To her surprise, an unexpected change occurred to the battlefield.An exceptionally well-built wolf finally found an opening to bite down on the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino\u2019s ass. Gleeful at its success, it was planning to rip out its intestines just like how it usually dealt with its other prey. Yet, its body suddenly shuddered and it fell still on the ground.And soon, there was a second victim, a third victim, a fourth victim\u2026It took the deaths of over 20 Assrip Wolves before the pack finally noticed that something was amiss. They quickly backed away fearfully from the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino.In the language of the wolves:\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either!\u201d\u201cI know!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat fellow\u2019s shit is poisoned!\u201d\u2026The leader of the Assrip Wolves was infuriated. \u201cThink about how much shit we have eaten over the years! When have we ever been poisoned before? That big oaf must possess some ability that we don\u2019t know of. Be careful, everyone!\u201dThe Assrip Wolves finally put their heart at ease. It was far beyond their common sense that a living being\u2019s shit could be poisoned. If so, they would never be able to hunt their prey down at ease anymore!The Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino also noticed the twist in the situation. Could it be that my ass possesses some powers that I don\u2019t know of? My mum never told me about this though?Realizing that the arrogant Assrip Wolves were starting to steer clear of his ass, the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino, from its initial defensive stance, began to flaunt its ass in front of them. If it could speak, it would probably be shouting \u2018Come and get a taste of my ass if you dare!\u2019.Zu An saw the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino provoking those Assrip Wolves, and he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that that fellow would be so immodest.\u201dOn the other hand, Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s face blushed completely red. This was a sight that was hard to watch for a demure woman like her. She turned her head to the other side, but she was still unable to suppress her curiosity. \u201cHow did you do it? Was it that dagger?\u201dZu An nodded. \u201cI applied a deadly poison on the dagger\u2019s blade. When the Assrip Wolves bit down on the Crazy Rhino\u2019s rear, the blade nicked and poisoned them.\u201d He wasn\u2019t willing to reveal the true secret behind the Poisonous Prick, so he found a passable excuse instead.\u201cI see.\u201d Ji Xiaoxi nodded. Despite so, she wondered just what kind of poison in the world could last for so long. After all, there was only so much poison that one could coat on the tip of a dagger. It shouldn\u2019t have been enough to kill over 20 Assrip Wolves, no matter how potent the poison was.Back in the Wolf Valley, the Assrip Wolves were completely infuriated by the provocations of the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino. They dashed forward to bite down on its rear, but unfortunately, every time they sank their fangs into the latter\u2019s ass, the Poisonous Prick would take effect, causing more and more Assrip Wolves to lose their lives.\u201cOhhhhh~\u201dInitially, the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was still in great pain by having a foreign object stabbed into its rear. But over time, it found itself slowly getting used to it, such that it was no longer that painful anymore. Furthermore, each time the Assrip Wolves bit down on the dagger, the dagger would vibrate in his body, inducing spasms of pleasure through its body. A new set of doors were opening right before its eyes.This time around, the Assrip Wolves were really panicked. They backed away fearfully as they quickly discussed with one another.\u201cThat fellow\u2019s shit is really poisoned!\u201dThe leader of the Assrip Wolves: \u201cHow could shit possibly be poisoned? Are you denying the experience and traditions of our tribe for over the past thousand years?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and have a taste then!\u201d An Assrip Wolf that was usually at loggerheads howled at the leader. Its size was nearly on par with the leader.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go then!\u201dThe leader of the Assrip Wolves knew that the other party had been coveting his position. It took notice of the frightened expression of its subordinates, which made it realize that its standing and prestige would be shaken at this rate. Thus, it decided to make a move personally so as to instill confidence in its leadership once more.Thus, it began prowling around the rear of the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino, and when it finally found an opportune moment, it darted forward with speed as swift as lightning. From experience, it knew that this was it. With a quick rip, it would be able to pull the intestines of the Crazy Rhino out and bring about its death.It was then that the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino\u2019s body suddenly froze up. Due to its rear being jammed up for too long, as well as the intense battle causing a lot of putrid gases to accumulate in its stomach, its abdomen began wiggling about. Then, with a prolonged \u2018Poooooot~\u2019, the Crazy Rhino released a massive and resounding fart that caused all of the shit that had been piling up inside to spill out. Naturally, the dagger that was previously lodged inside was pushed out too.As a result, the leader of the Assrip Wolves found itself smeared in shit. It was just about to lose its temper and launch a devastating attack when its body suddenly stiffened, and it fell to the ground dead.As it turned out, while the dagger that was jolted out wasn\u2019t strong enough to inflict a lethal wound on the leader of the Assrip Wolves, it did leave a small nick on its face that eventually took away its life.You have successfully trolled Assrip Wolf King for +10 Rage!\u201cIts shit is really poisoned!\u201d\u201cOur king has died from shit!\u201d\u2026All of the other Assrip Wolves were scared out of their wits. Faced with such a situation, they quickly scattered and fled toward the mountain forest.Meanwhile, the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino shook its head. It had no idea what was happening, but having come so close to death by the encirclement of the Assrip Wolves had really shaken it up badly. So, it quickly fled from the scene shakily. It was in no mood to find the earlier human to exact vengeance anymore.As a result, peace returned back to the valley. Zu An slid down the slope first before opening his arms wide, saying, \u201cXiaoxi, be careful. I\u2019ll catch you.\u201dJi Xiaoxi shook her head and replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201dWith a flip of her body, she landed gracefully in the valley. It was a performance far more spectacular than what Zu An did earlier.It was only then that Zu An suddenly remembered that Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s cultivation was higher than him, and he scratched his head sheepishly. He quickly ran to the middle of the battlefield and picked up the Poisonous Prick.It was fortunate that the Crazy Rhino had shot it out, or else he would have to use the Poison Bottle to knock it out so that he could retrieve it.\u201cArgh, this smell!\u201dEven though the Poisonous Prick was wrapped around in a handkerchief, there was still a frighteningly putrid smell coming from it. Zu An took out his water bottle and washed it again and again before finally keeping it.Ji Xiaoxi was intending to take a look to see just what kind of formidable poison the dagger was coated with, but when Zu An kept it, she found herself a little too embarrassed to ask about it. In her view, everyone had their own secrets to survive in this world, and it seemed a little insensitive of her to ask about such a private matter.Zu An, on the other hand, thought that Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s hesitation was due to another reason. He picked up the handkerchief on the ground by the corner and passed it to her, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll give this back to you. You can try washing it and see if it\u2019s still usable.\u201dLooking at the yellowish stains covering the entire handkerchief, as well as the horrendous smell coming from it, Ji Xiaoxi froze in place. \u201c\u2026\u201dYou have successfully trolled Ji Xiaoxi for +1!Zu An was amused by her response. This lady sure has a good temper. Even with this, her Rage is still only 1. It looks like she\u2019s the kind to never get angry at anyone.\u201cYou can toss it away. I don\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d Ji Xiaoxi forced out a smile as she spoke. She noticed the other party looking at her with an earnest look, which made her feel guilty about it instead.Zu An casually tossed the handkerchief to the side and said, \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to keep the handkerchief either. Even the thought of washing it was enough to disgust him.Ji Xiaoxi nodded casually, clearly thinking nothing about it. She looked at the corpses of the Assrip Wolves around and said, \u201cLet\u2019s quickly look around to see if there\u2019s any goubaos around. It\u2019ll be troublesome if the wolf pack returns.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, those Assrip Wolves have already lost their guts from the earlier incident. I reckon that they won\u2019t be back anytime soon,\u201d Zu An said.Little did he know that those Assrip Wolves had begun doubting their own existence due to this incident. For the next few months to come, they no longer dared to target their target\u2019s ass anymore, and that nearly led to their extinction.Zu An still immediately got to work. He tore open the stomachs of the Assrip Wolves one after another, and in the end, he managed to collect a total of 12 goubaos, including the one he originally had.It was just a pity that there wasn\u2019t any demonic core of that sort of stuff. He had read a lot of novels regarding transmigration in his previous world, so he was still looking forward to obtaining some sort of special reward. However, there was nothing to be found even after searching through the carcass of the pack\u2019s leader several times.\u201cYou\u2019re truly formidable. You managed to kill so many Assrip Wolves,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi remarked in admiration.\u201cHahaha, you\u2019re flattering me.\u201d Despite Zu An\u2019s humble words, his expression was saying \u2018praise me more, praise me more\u2019.Seeing as Zu An stowed the goubaos away, Ji Xiaoxi hesitated for a long while before speaking up, \u201cI have a request to ask of you. I know that it might be unreasonable, but I would still like to try asking.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An was stunned. Looking at how embarrassed Ji Xiaoxi was, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what she wanted to say. \u201cFeel free to speak your mind. We can be considered as buddies who have gone through tough times and bathed\u2026 Cough cough, ignore what I just said. What I mean is that I already consider you as a friend, so feel free to speak your mind.\u201dJi Xiaoxi retracted her already outstretched fist and quickly reverted back to her embarrassed look. \u201cYou see, my father has been concocting a medicine recently, and one of the ingredients required is Assrip Wolf goubaos. As you know, there\u2019s likely to be no Assrip Wolves in the Wolf Valley anymore in the short-run, making it hard to secure this ingredient. So, can you sell some of it to me?\u201dZu An wondered how Ji Xiaoxi would react once she realized that he was collecting these goubaos for her father. However, his mouth moved far faster than his brain. \u201cHow much do you intend to offer for them?\u201dJi Xiaoxi replied, \u201cOrdinary goubaos aren\u2019t that expensive, but the market price for Assrip Wolf goubao is 10 silver taels each.\u201dZu An was astonished. These things are actually that expensive? However, when he thought into it, it did make perfect sense. One must know that the Assrip Wolves were known for their savage nature, and only around one in ten Assrip Wolves had a goubao. Those who wanted to hunt Assrip Wolves had to put their lives on the line for it. Even the slightest mistake could result in their ass getting ripped.Zu An\u2019s mind whirred quickly, and he replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t it wrong to calculate it like that? Given the current situation, it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s impossible to procure Assrip Wolf goubaos in Brightmoon City anymore.\u201d If Divine Physician Ji could really buy them off the market, there would be no need for him to put up this task in the first place.Zu An paused for a moment before continuing on, \u201cBesides, you also mentioned yourself that there won\u2019t be any Assrip Wolves in the Wolf Valley in the short-run. Most likely, the price of Assrip Wolf goubaos will soar very soon.\u201dJi Xiaoxi blinked her eyes contemplatively before nodding in agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re right, what you said makes sense. My apologies, I failed to take these factors into account.\u201dZu An was dumbfounded. He was just trying to sound her out, yet she suddenly started apologizing? She was really a little too innocent for the vile world out there. Thinking about how Divine Physician Ji was like, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if they were really blood-related.\u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll buy these goubaos for 13\u2026 Ah, no. I mean, 15 silver taels each. How does that sound to you?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi looked at Zu An expectantly. \u201cI only have that much money on me.\u201dLooking at how carefully Ji Xiaoxi was making an offer, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but feel sympathy for Divine Physician Ji. What use was it for him to so desperately accrue money? With a daughter like this, all of his wealth would eventually go to benefit his son-in-law.\u201cSure. How many are you intending on buying?\u201d Zu An asked.\u201cThank you!\u201d Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s eyes lit up in delight. \u201cI wish to buy 10 of them. Is that too many?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not. Here, I\u2019ll give them all to you,\u201d Zu An said with a chuckle as he passed all 12 goubaos over. His main reason for hunting these things was to offset the consultation fee anyway. There was no need for him to keep them with him.Considering that he had just earned 150 silver taels, even if he paid 100 silver taels for the consultation, he would still have an additional 50 silver taels remaining. I wonder if Divine Physician Ji will spit blood out once he learns about this.Ji Xiaoxi anxious waved her hands and said, \u201cThat won\u2019t do! I don\u2019t have that much money to pay for it all!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t plan on charging you for the two extras. You can treat it as a gift,\u201d Zu An placed his hand on her shoulder as he spoke heartily. \u201cWe\u2019re friends after all!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi was overjoyed. \u201cYou really are a good person!\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give out \u2018good person\u2019 cards that easily,\u201d Zu An said with a stifled look on his face. All of a sudden, he yelped in pain. \u201cAh? Why does my hand\u2026 hurt so much?\u201dJi Xiaoxi stuck her tongue out and said, \u201cAiya, I nearly forgot. My father has applied \u2018Anti-Jackass Cream\u2019 on my clothes. I\u2019ll get the antidote for you right now!\u201dThe sight of Divine Physician Ji laughing gleefully flashed across Zu An\u2019s mind as he finally understood why that fellow was willing to let his daughter venture into the mountain to gather herbs all on her own. It turned out that he had already prepared her thoroughly.Ji Xiaoxi hurriedly took out a bottle from her bag and rubbed it on Zu An\u2019s hand. She pulled his hand over to her mouth and blew lightly on it. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201dLooking at her palm-sized face, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, \u201cIt did hurt a lot earlier, but after you blew on it, it no longer hurts anymore.\u201dJi Xiaoxi\u2019s face reddened. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me.\u201dZu An couldn\u2019t help but remark, \u201cXiaoxi, if you treat everyone that well, bad guys will take advantage of you.\u201dJi Xiaoxi replied without any hesitation, \u201cI won\u2019t allow any guys to touch my body though. You aren\u2019t like those normal men.\u201dZu An: \u201c\u2026\u201dAm I being treated like a sister right now? It\u2019s a pity that the keyboard doesn\u2019t collect my Rage, or else it would be exploding off the charts right now!Ji Xiaoxi swiftly noticed the problem in what she had just said, and she quickly apologized, \u201cAh no, that\u2019s not what I mean! I\u2026\u201dSeeing how Ji Xiaoxi was too flustered to explain herself, Zu An patted her head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019re friends, so I won\u2019t mind it.\u201dSince he had already been treated as a sister, he might as well make use of it to its fullest advantage. In his previous life, there were plenty of trashy men who pretended that they were gay in order to get close to girls before eventually rolling on the bed with them.Pui! Who is a trashy man? Anyway, it\u2019s not me!While Zu An\u2019s thoughts were wandering, he noticed Ji Xiaoxi looking at him with a look of sympathy. \u201cAh\u2026 I should have told you that the medicine is on my hair too\u2026\u201dZu An stared at his hand, which was already as swollen as a bun right now, and he felt like bursting into tears. Didn\u2019t you just wash yourself in the river earlier on?\u2026A young man and a young woman walked alongside one another on a mountainous point to return to the city. Along the way, the young woman suddenly approached the young man, but the young man immediately leaped to the side as if she was some kind of poisonous mushroom.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Zu An stared at Ji Xiaoxi warily.Ji Xiaoxi looked at him apologetically. Her lips pouted indignantly as she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201dZu An knew that he had it coming earlier, so it was too immature of him to blame her for it. \u201cAlright, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It was my fault for approaching you too carelessly. But speaking of which, how did you produce the wall of water earlier in the river?\u201dEver since coming to this world, he had been curious about everything concerning cultivation, and he wanted to know everything he could about it.Ji Xiaoxi widened her eyes, \u201cYou were peeping on me back then?\u201dZu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He had completely forgotten about that! \u201cAh, I didn\u2019t hear anything from you, so I took a quick look out of worry. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t see anything at all. You did block off everything with the wall of water.\u201dJi Xiaoxi was a little doubtful, but she still decided to trust him in the end. \u201cCultivators of the third rank are able to release their ki a short distance away. They are able to form armor, ki barrier, or anything you can think of within a radius of three chi around them. My water wall works using the same principles.\u201d(Around 1 meter)\u201cI see!\u201d Zu An finally made sense of the situation. It looked like the second rank made one\u2019s skin more resilient whereas the third rank allowed one to release one\u2019s ki externally. He looked forward to seeing what special skills he would learn when he advanced his cultivation further.Ji Xiaoxi suddenly halted his footsteps. She pricked up her ears, as if picking up on something. \u201cBig brother Zu, do you hear that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zu An asked. He didn\u2019t hear anything at all.\u201cI hear people fighting,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s eyebrows arched upward. Clearly, she wasn\u2019t too fond of violence.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly leave the area,\u201d Zu An said. If he was a powerhouse, he wouldn\u2019t mind heading over to show off his strength, but he was currently a weakling who was even weaker than Ji Xiaoxi. This world was simply too dangerous for him at the moment, so it would be best for him to keep a low profile.As the saying went, the one who laughs last laughs the best!\u201cI think we should still take a look. There might be someone who needs to be treated,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi grabbed Zu An and stopped him. Her gentle eyes had turned firm in resolution.Seeing her pure eyes, Zu An found himself caving in to her request. \u201cAlright then. However, if it gets too dangerous, don\u2019t blame me for running ahead of you. Also, I trust that you don\u2019t have poison on your hands, right?\u201d\u201cRest assured, there\u2019s no poison here!\u201d Having received Zu An\u2019s approval, Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s eyes curled up to form smiling crescents.The two of them quickly headed in the direction where the ruckus was coming from. In another valley, they found a carriage completely surrounded by black-clothed men. The guards standing around the carriage were trying their best to fend against the assault of the black-clothed men, but they were severely outnumbered. On top of that, each of the black-clothed men were also considerably powerful, and their strikes were both sharp and vicious. Many guards had already fallen amidst a puddle of blood.It was only a matter of time before the remaining guards fell too.Zu An noticed that the guards were all wearing white shirts with golden stitchings on their sleeves. It made them look suave.\u201cHow bloody extravagant. How rich must they be for even their guards to be wearing such expensive clothes?\u201d Zu An subconsciously looked at his scrubby clothes and felt a little tilted inside. They look more like the son-in-law of a duke estate whereas I am their guard!\u201cBut what\u2019s the use of dressing well? It\u2019s just all for show!\u201d Zu An\u2019s envy was only appeased after seeing how the guards were being forced back by the black-clothed men.\u201cThose men are from the Blackwind Stockade!\u201d Ji Xiaoxi exclaimed with a hushed voice. Even though she was kind and innocent, she was not a fool. She didn\u2019t rush out blindly just because she saw that there were casualties. Instead, she pulled Zu An behind a bush to observe the situation.The outcome of the battle was already sealed, and they would only be giving their lives away by rushing out now. Nevertheless, Ji Xiaoxi still felt conflicted seeing those people getting brutally killed right before her eyes.\u201cBlackwing Stockade? That is such a cannon fodder name. I reckon that the stockade must be some minor organization that barely sees the light of the day,\u201d Zu An remarked.\u201cFar from that,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi replied solemnly. \u201cThe Blackwind Stockade is a bandit band founded by Great Bandit Chen Xuan. Those bandits are known to be incredibly vicious, and they are quite strong too. They have been making a living by plundering the merchants passing by the area, and countless people have already lost their lives to them.\u201dZu An asked, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the city dispatch an army out to eliminate them then? There are so many experts in the city, after all. Is everyone really fine with them messing around like that?\u201dBased on the information he had gathered, most of the stronger cultivators had been taken in by the government. As such, a bandit band was unlikely to be able to withstand the fighting prowess of a city\u2019s military force.Ji Xiaoxi explained, \u201cDuke Chu and City Lord Xie have dispatched a lot of soldiers out to eliminate them over the years, but those bandits are not that easy to deal with. They are elusive and hard to track down. If the city dispatches too few soldiers, those bandits would destroy them without any hesitation. If the city dispatches too many soldiers, those bandits would venture deeper into the mountain and camp it out. However, as soon as the soldiers retreat, they will make an appearance once more. These bandits are a huge menace to Brightmoon City.\u201dZu An couldn\u2019t help but feel that the Chu clan was inept. Despite looking like a huge deal, they couldn\u2019t even handle a mere bandit band.All of a sudden, Zu An noticed something and asked, \u201cYou mentioned that the Blackwind Stockade has always been able to move in advance to avoid the army dispatched against them? That sounds like they have an insider working for them.\u201dJi Xiaoxi nodded in agreement.\u201d Big brother Zu, you are really clever. That\u2019s what my father said too.\u201dThat greedy and perverted scruffy middle-aged man flashed across Zu An\u2019s mind once more. It was really hard to imagine that he could be sober enough to analyze matters.\u201cMadame, we have held them down. You must leave right away!\u201d A white-clothed guard pushed the enemy back as he glanced at the carriage behind him and shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An had been paying attention to that carriage in the middle of the scuffle. It was both imposing and extravagant that one\u2019s attention was naturally drawn to it.\u201cIs it a Rolls Royce?\u201d While there were no similarities in terms of appearance, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but relate the carriage to it.Regardless of which world one was in, the aesthetics of a human were still quite uniform. The carriage looked like an artwork no matter which angle one were to look at it from. Every single stroke on it was the crystallization of the blood, sweat, and tears of a master craftsman. Four dashing steeds were pulling the carriage from the front, and these steeds had a muscular build and lustrous hair. They looked impeccable and dashing.The carriage wheels and even the hooves of the steeds were cloaked in blue light. It was an extremely delicate formation that allowed the carriage to maneuver through any difficult terrain without bringing the slightest tremor to the passengers seated inside the carriage.Zu An had once ridden on the Chu clan\u2019s carriage before, but it came nowhere in comparison to the one right before his eyes.It was then that he heard a pleasing female voice sounding from within the carriage. \u201cGo? Where can I go?\u201d It was a voice that was tinged with a hint of coyness and a hint of laziness, such that it seemed to melt right into one. It was tinged with confusion.\u201cWhat a melodious voice!\u201d Ji Xiaoji muttered to herself in a daze after hearing the voice. On the other hand, Zu An thought nothing of it. In his previous world, the digital age, there were plenty of people who made a living out of their voices, be it voice actors, vtubers, or video makers. He had heard far too many beautiful voices to know that a good voice didn\u2019t equate to good looks. There were far too many pitiful souls who had been fooled by the allure of a beautiful voice.Meanwhile, the black-clothed men also lost their senses for a moment, but they soon burst into laughter. \u201cJust as we thought, Madame Yu is indeed in there! Brother, let\u2019s push on! Soon, we\u2019ll be able to have a taste of the previous number one beauty of the capital!\u201dThose words brought the morale of the black-clothed men to greater heights as they cheered in excitement.The eyes of the white-clothed guards reddened upon hearing those words, but there was only so much they could do with a numerical disadvantage. No matter how they tapped into the hidden potential in their bodies, there was no way they could stand against an onslaught of attacks coming from all directions.\u201cAh! So it\u2019s her!\u201d Ji Xiaoxi exclaimed in astonishment.Zu An asked in curiosity, \u201cWhy? Do you recognize the person in the carriage?\u201dJi Xiaoxi shook her head and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know her in person, but I have heard of her. Cloudmidst\u2019s Yu clan deals in ki stones, and they are the most renowned tycoon in the world. Back in those days, the matriarch of the Yu clan, Yu Yanluo, awed the entire capital with her grace and beauty, such that there are still countless men who can\u2019t forget about her to this day.\u201dSpeaking up to this point, Ji Xiaoxi suddenly recalled how his father proclaimed himself to be Yu Yanluo\u2019s number one fan, and she suddenly felt deeply embarrassed.Zu An frowned in confusion after hearing those words, \u201cJudging by what you just said, the Yu clan should be pretty formidable. It doesn\u2019t make sense why they aren\u2019t able to handle a group of bandits.\u201dJi Xiaoxi quickly corrected Zu An\u2019s misconception. \u201cThe Blackwind Stockade isn\u2019t any ordinary bandit band. They are incredibly powerful bandits that even Duke Chu is\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish her words, Zu An had already cut right in, \u201cNo matter how formidable they are, bandits are still bandits. Besides, just as you have said, the Yu clan is one of the richest tycoons in the country, and their matriarch is a known beauty. Given so, they are bound to attract attention from enemies and major powers. If this is the standard of the guards they have, how in the world did she manage to survive to this day without any major incidents?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d Ji Xiaoxi didn\u2019t think that Zu An would have such a strong opinion on this matter. She pondered for a while before responding, \u201cIt could be due to her husband, the Cloudmidst Duke, passing away in an accident recently, resulting in an internal turmoil in the Yu clan. That might have affected the quality of guards she brings around with her.\u201d\u201cPolitics inside major clans sure are messy,\u201d Zu An remarked with a sigh. It had only been two days since he joined the Chu clan, and he already had so many near death encounters. Someone like Yu Yanluo was likely to have faced far more of such stuff than him.\u201cIs the one leading the bandits down there Great Bandit Chen Xuan?\u201d Zu An asked as he pointed to the leader of the black-clothed bandits.Ji Xiaoxi shook her head and replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be him. Chen Xuan is a sixth rank cultivator, possibly even reaching the seventh rank. However, of those below, none of them have even reached the fifth rank.\u201d\u201cAh, there is a question in my mind that I have been wanting to ask you for a long time. How do you discern the cultivation level of a person?\u201d Zu An asked. It was not as if this was a game, where the level of the enemies would be displayed on top of their heads. His inability to discern the cultivation level of his enemies would make it hard to deal with threats that were headed his way.After all, not everyone was like Plum Blossom Twelve, who would be foolish enough to give away his cultivation level.\u201cYou don\u2019t even know that?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi asked in surprise. Nevertheless, she still explained the matter patiently, \u201cIn the first rank, a cultivator learns to sense raw ki. In the second rank, a cultivator\u2019s skin hardens, allowing him to deal with ordinary swords barehanded. In the third rank, a cultivator gains the ability to release ki in a radius of 3 chi around his body to form barriers to block against enemy attacks.\u201cIn the fourth rank, a cultivator is able to emanate ki away from his body, allowing for long-distance attacks. In the fifth rank, a cultivator awakens his ability to control the elements and imbue them into his attacks. In the sixth rank, a cultivator can form an elemental barrier to fend against elemental-type attacks.\u201cIn the seventh rank, a cultivator\u2019s regeneration ability will be significantly boosted, such that the attacks of low-level enemies wouldn\u2019t even be able to keep up with his rate of recovery. In the eighth rank, a cultivator becomes able to communicate with raw ki, allowing him to tap into a far greater reserve of power. I\u2019m not too sure about anything beyond that, but it seems that even flight is possible once one reaches a certain level.\u201cThose bandits before are incapable of using elemental attacks, which goes to show that none of them have reached the fifth rank. I believe that the leader of the group is the Blackwind Stockade\u2019s Third Master, Bao Gang.\u201cI see!\u201d Zu An nodded in realization after hearing the explanation. He continued observing the battle below, but this time around, he wasn\u2019t as confused as he was before anymore. He was able to get a rough grasp of their fighting prowess.Most of the black-clothed bandits below were at the second rank, though a couple of them had reached the third rank. Only the leader of the bandits was at the fourth rank.Putting it together with what he had learned thus far, a fourth rank cultivator was already able to become the lord of a smaller city whereas a third rank cultivator could serve as a magistrate of a smaller city. Judging by such a standard, it would indeed be unwise to think of the Blackwind Stockade as ordinary bandits.The guard captain of the Yu clan was at fourth rank too whereas the others were all at third rank. If they had been any weaker than that, it would have been impossible for them to survive till now. It was just a pity that they were too severely outnumbered, such that their defeat was already sealed.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d The leader of the black-clothed bandits suddenly turned over. It turned out that Zu An and Ji Xiaoxi had spoken a little too loud earlier, revealing their presence.\u201cYou should quickly leave!\u201d Ji Xiaoxi exclaimed in shock to Zu An. She was the one who proposed coming here to save the wounded, so she couldn\u2019t allow Zu An to get hurt because of her.She had already used up nearly all of the medicine she brought with her on the mountain, so it was uncertain if they could deal with these bandits.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Zu An was surprised. Was this lass really intending to stay behind to hold back the enemies?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can protect myself. Besides, my father is Ji Dengtu. They dare not to touch me,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi said hurriedly.Zu An shook his head. \u201cThose bandits dare to touch even the renowned Yu clan! There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll care whether you are the daughter of a divine physician or not.\u201dJi Xiaoxi was taken aback by Zu An\u2019s words. She was about to tell him that her father was actually a really formidable figure, but before she could voice that aloud, Zu An had already spoken anxiously ahead of her, \u201cHide yourself well and don\u2019t come out!\u201dFollowing that, Zu An leaped out and remarked, \u201cOho! In the middle of the day, under the glorious rays of the sun, you dare to commit such atrocities in public!\u201dJi Xiaoxi\u2019s mouth widened in shock as she wondered if Zu An was out of his mind. It was one thing for him to run out and expose himself to the bandits, but he even dared to provoke them too!As expected, the black-clothed bandits immediately began hollering back at him, \u201cWhere did this nasty brat come from? Are you planning on interfering in the affairs of our Blackwind Stockade?\u201dZu An froze in place. \u201cYou\u2019re from the Blackwind Stockade?\u201cOf course! Who are you?\u201d The leader of the black-clothed bandits stared at Zu An warily. The latter had suddenly leaped out of nowhere, such that he couldn\u2019t really discern the latter\u2019s background. For the time being, it was better to do some probing so as to get an idea as to who they were dealing with first.As a result, the battle between the black-clothed bandits and the Yu clan ceased temporarily.Zu An clasped his fist and said, \u201cI am Cheng Shouping. Those in the pugilistic world know me as a person with lips as tight as a cork on a bottle!\u201dOver in the bushes, Ji Xiaoxi blinked her eyes. Who is Cheng Shouping?The black-clothed bandits were equally confused too. They had never heard of such a figure in the pugilistic world before. Nevertheless, they thought that Zu An was likely to be a formidable expert, or else he wouldn\u2019t dare to stand before them so calmly.At the same time, seeing how the intruder had started chatting with the black-clothed bandits, the guards of the Yu clan flew into a panic. The guard captain shouted out loud, \u201cThat hero over there, we\u2019re from the Cloudmidst\u2019s Yu clan! If you\u2019re willing to lend us a helping hand, the Yu clan will surely repay the favor generously!\u201dBao Gang\u2019s face immediately darkened. He shot a glance at his subordinates and gestured them to take a detour around the forest to seal off this \u2018Cheng Shouping\u2019s\u2019 escape route. After all, they couldn\u2019t allow anyone to know that they were the culprits who attacked the Yu clan\u2019s carriage.\u201cGenerously?\u201d Zu An repeated contemplatively. \u201cHow generous?\u201dThose of the Yu clan was flabbergasted by the response they received. This man isn\u2019t playing by the norms! Shouldn\u2019t he say stuff like what \u2018a true hero doesn\u2019t expect any rewards\u2019 and lend them a helping hand?But in any case, the guard captain still responded to Zu An\u2019s question right away, \u201cI dare not say the fortunes of our Yu clan can truly rival that of the country, but be it gold, silver, legendary weapons, ki stones, or even conferment of nobility, regardless of what it is that you need, our Yu clan will surely satisfy your demands!\u201dZu An nodded in response. \u201cThat sounds like a fair offer, but I\u2019m a cultured person who appreciates art more. I heard that your matriarch used to be the number one beauty in the capital. Could I ask for her instead?\u201dBao Gang was initially afraid that this intruder would intervene and help the Yu clan, but after hearing those words, he found himself rendered dumbfounded. He nearly shouted out \u2018Respect, bro\u2019. In any case, seeing that this intruder bore no ill will toward them, he ordered the subordinates that were going to surround the intruder to come back and just stay on their guard.The face of the guard captain darkened. \u201cPlease do not joke around.\u201dZu An shrugged casually as he responded, \u201cI\u2019m not joking around. As long as your matriarch is willing to accompany me for a night, I\u2019ll settle these men from the Blackwind Stockade for you.\u201dBehind the bushes, Ji Xiaoxi found her face reddening upon hearing those words. That man is obviously\u2026 yet he still puts on a licentious act.But while she knew Zu An\u2019s circumstances, those of the Yu clan didn\u2019t. All of the guards began glaring at him furiously.You have successfully trolled Yu Bin for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Yu Jun for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Yu Meng for +99 Rage!\u2026Seeing the huge inflow of Rage points, Zu An felt that the Rage system was simply too compatible with him. For him, earning Rage was almost as easy as breathing. The only regret he had was obtaining this Rage system far too late in life. Otherwise, with his skills on the internet forums, he should have already earned enough points for him to ascend to godhood by now!However, one thing that left Zu An surprised was that Madame Yu didn\u2019t provide him with any Rage points at all. Could it be that she didn\u2019t mind his rude remarks at all?Disregarding the murderous gazes coming from the guards, Zu An turned to Bao Gang and said, \u201cI have a deep respect for the Blackwind Stockade, especially after hearing of the great deeds you have pulled off. The only regret I have in my life is not having the opportunity to join your ranks. Since fate has brought us together today, may I humbly ask you to take me in? I don\u2019t need anything at all. I just hope that you can share Madame Yu with me once you\u2019re done here.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yu Bin for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Yu Jun for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Yu Meng for +99 Rage!\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBao Gang burst into laughter. \u201cOf course, that isn\u2019t a problem at all! Our Blackwind Stockade welcomes men from all walks of life. Shall we get rid of these remaining guards together first?\u201dDespite his words, Bao Gang was thinking of something very different on the inside. Assaulting the Yu clan was a huge matter, such that he couldn\u2019t risk even the slightest possibility of the news leaking outward. If this intruder were to get away, it would spell trouble for them.The only reason why he dared not make a move yet was due to him being unsure of this man\u2019s background, and their hands were currently occupied with the Yu clan\u2019s guards. The best scenario would indubitably be for them to first get rid of the Yu clan\u2019s guards before gathering all of the brothers to eliminate him.In any case, this man was unlikely to be at the fifth rank or higher, or else he could have curbed the Yu clan\u2019s guards all alone. There was no need to propose a partnership.Behind the bushes, Ji Xiaoxi was feeling utterly confused about the current situation. She couldn\u2019t figure out what Zu An was trying to pull here. If she hadn\u2019t known about Zu An\u2019s peculiar condition, she would have even suspected her of harboring such horrendous thoughts.\u201cSounds good with me!\u201d Zu An drew his dagger and charged forth to clash with one of the Yu clan\u2019s guards.The outcome of the clash was the Yu clan\u2019s guard shook a little whereas Zu An was knocked several meters back.The crowd from the Blackwind Stockade: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe crowd from the Yu clan: \u201c\u2026\u201dThey thought that they had encountered an expert in the wilderness, but it turned out that he wasn\u2019t even a match for a third rank guard? Not to mention, the guard had just been through a bitter battle and was nearly completely exhausted by now!You have successfully trolled Bao Gang for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Blackwind Stockade Bandit A for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Blackwind Stockade Bandit B for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Blackwind Stockade Bandit C for +99 Rage!\u2026Bao Gang thought about just how careful he had trod around the intruder earlier, calculating the chances of winning and the probability of bringing the intruder over to his side. Yet, it turned out that the intruder was merely at the second rank! This made him feel as if he had been made a fool of.He felt incredibly tempted to end the intruder\u2019s life right away with a slash of his blade, but at the same time, he was worried that the intruder might have just been putting on an act to get his guard down. Thus, he chose to suppress his urge for the time being. You dare to make a fool out of me? Just wait till I\u2019m done with the Yu clan. I\u2019ll skin you alive!You have successfully trolled Bao Gang for +199 Rage!Looking at Bao Gang\u2019s twitching cheeks, Zu An felt his heart flowering in happiness. This fellow sure is kind to provide me with so much Rage points.In the battle to come, Zu An no longer took the frontline anymore. Instead, he weaved around the battlefield and stuck his blade in from time to time. He was trying to get a feel of the battlefield while adapting to his newfound powers. After all, he had never been in a proper battle before, even when he was dealing with Plum Blossom Twelve.However, his actions only made those from the Blackwind Stockade grit their teeth in frustration. Not only was Zu An not helping at all, but he was also hindering their attacks! If not for the Third Master\u2019s orders, they would have already decapitated this nosey fellow by now!You have successfully trolled Blackwind Stockade Bandit A for +33 Rage!You have successfully trolled Blackwind Stockade Bandit B for +33 Rage!You have successfully trolled Blackwind Stockade Bandit C for +33 Rage!\u2026After a short battle, all of the Yu clan\u2019s guards were captured. After a moment of hesitation, Boa Gang chose not to kill them on the spot. Instead, he simply planted some restrictions on their bodies.They still needed to extract critical intelligence regarding the Yu clan from them, and they could use these people to blackmail Madame Yu.Meanwhile, seeing that the Yu clan\u2019s guards had been curbed, Zu An rubbed his hands licentiously and began making his way toward the carriage. \u201cFinally, I\u2019m going to see Madame Yu\u2019s beautiful face in person.\u201d\u201cThe Yu clan will never let you off!\u201d One of the guards who had a sword pressed against his neck glared at Zu An furiously.You have successfully trolled Yu Bin for +299 Rage!You have successfully trolled Yu Jun for +299 Rage!You have successfully trolled Yu Meng for +299 Rage!\u2026Zu An chuckled softly. \u201cWe\u2019re in the wilderness. The Yu clan will never find out what I did here.\u201d\u201cBro, aren\u2019t you getting ahead of yourself right now?\u201d Bao Gang\u2019s cold harrumph suddenly sounded from behind.Zu An\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dBao Gang waved his hand, and the black-clothed bandits immediately surrounded him. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who wouldn\u2019t be interested in a beauty like Madame Yu, but there are so many of us but only one of her. It wouldn\u2019t even be enough for us to go around, so how could we share her with you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to cast me away after making use of me?\u201d Zu An pointed at Bao Gang as his body trembled in fury.\u201cPui!\u201d Bao Gang spat coldly. \u201cWhere did this ruffian come from? With your measly second rank cultivation, I really wonder where you found the galls to dare negotiate with me!\u201dBao Gang was certain that Zu An was only at second rank after observing him closely throughout the entire battle. The latter definitely wasn\u2019t feigning weak.\u201cMince that fellow up and feed him to the dogs!\u201d Bao Gang issued an order. The anger that he had been suppressing all this while was finally going to be vented, and he suddenly felt refreshed all over.\u201cHold it right there!\u201dMeanwhile, seeing that Zu An was in a desperate situation, Ji Xiaoxi lost her patience. She wasn\u2019t sure what Zu An was up to, but she knew that if she didn\u2019t intervene right now, he would lose his life right after.\u201cThere\u2019s actually another person here!\u201d Bao Gang exclaimed in astonishment. He did sense that there was someone in that direction, but since Zu An had leaped out, he assumed that there was only one person. He had been too careless here. If that woman were to flee the area and spread the news of their deed\u2026 Just the thought of it made him sweat profusely.\u201cHahaha, Third Master! It\u2019s yet another beautiful lass! It looks like our luck is quite good today!\u201d Seeing Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s beautiful face, the black-clothed bandits began catcalling in anticipation.While they did say that they would have fun with Madam Yu earlier, they knew their own place. There was no way someone of Madame Yu\u2019s caliber would fall into their hands. Most likely, she would be specially reserved for the masters.However, it was different with this young woman who had just popped out of nowhere. If they could capture her, she would be theirs!\u201cMy father is Brightmoon City\u2019s Ji Dengtu! If you release him, we won\u2019t divulge anything that we saw today!\u201d Ji Xiaoxi was well aware that with her current cultivation level, it would be futile for her to confront them. Thus, she could only bring out her father\u2019s name.The black-clothed bandits were first a little astonished before bursting into hearty laughter. \u201cHah, Ji Dengtu is just a mere physician! Who do you think you are trying to scare here?\u201d\u201cShut your trap!\u201d Bao Gang, however, frowned upon hearing those words. He had heard his big brother mentioning that there were a few people in Brightmoon City whom they absolutely couldn\u2019t mess with, and Ji Dengtu was one of them.Bao Gang hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he shook his head. \u201cI have heard of Ji Dengtu\u2019s reputation, but I\u2019m afraid that we can\u2019t risk this matter getting out. Brothers, capture her! The first one to get her will get the first taste of her!\u201dThe black-clothed bandits began roaring in excitement as they rushed forward to capture her.\u201cWatch my Finger Flick Secret Art!\u201dIt was then that a bellow suddenly sounded. Bao Gang heard something whizzing across the air behind him. Without any hesitation, he slashed his sword at the object and shattered it into pieces.\u201cHahaha! Is this your Finger Flick Secret Art?\u201d Bao Gang sneered coldly. However, barely after laughing a bit, his face suddenly paled in horror. \u201cY-you\u2026\u201dThen, he fell face-first onto the ground. Even the companions around him also collapsed too.\u201cThird Master, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d The other black-clothed bandits immediately rushed forward to help him up, but a few seconds later, they also collapsed to the ground too.Seeing this, Zu An heaved a sigh of relief. In truth, he had been finding an opportunity for those bandits to gather together so he could make use of his Poison Bottle. However, just as he was about to succeed, Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s sudden appearance nearly foiled his plan.He thought that he would have to fight the remaining bandits who were out of the area of effect of the Poison Bottle, but fortunately, these bandits were dumber than he thought. Too anxious to save their Third Master, they got into the range of the Poison Bottle and knocked themselves out too, sparing him a great deal of effort.\u201cYou brat! What kind of sorcery did you cast on us?!\u201d Bao Gang bellowed furiously from the ground. The ki in his body had been completely sealed, and he couldn\u2019t even move his body at all. His entire body felt numb, as if it wasn\u2019t his own anymore.You have successfully trolled Bao Gang for +333 Rage!\u201cI already told you. This is my Finger Flick Secret Art. Once I use this technique, everything within an area of 30 meters will turn utterly barren. You looked down on me, and this is the price for that.\u201d Despite saying that, Zu An dared not to approach Bao Gang. He wasn\u2019t sure whether there were still remnants of the poison lingering in the area. If he were to get poisoned too, that would be disastrous.\u201cI-I understand it now! We were blind for daring to snub you.\u201d Bao Gang quickly changed his tone after realizing the situation he was in. This intruder was really feigning weak all this while! \u201cMadame Yu is right in there, and she\u2019s all yours. We won\u2019t compete with you for her anymore!\u201dThe guards of the Yu clan were still in a daze. Everything had happened so quickly that they were having trouble trying to make sense of the change in the situation.\u201cPui!\u201d Figuring that the medicine should have mostly dispersed by now, Zu An finally walked up to Bao Gang\u2019s side and slapped his face with his knife. \u201cHeh, do you think that you\u2019re in any state to compete with me right now? Who was the one who wanted to mince me up and feed me to the dogs earlier on? Who were the ones who wanted to take advantage of our Xiaoxi?\u201dJi Xiaoxi was rushing over when she heard Zu An\u2019s intimate way of addressing her, and her face reddened.You have successfully trolled Bao Gang for +147 Rage!As the Third Master of the Blackwind Stockade, Bao Gang had been living the life of a king over the last few years. When had anyone dared to slap his face with a knife?\u201cI have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Please have mercy on me. Our Blackwind Stockade will surely remember this grace!\u201d As infuriated as Bao Gang was, he still quickly composed himself and brought out the Blackwind Blockade\u2019s name, hoping that it could instill some fear in Zu An.On the other hand, Zu An was amused by the use of the idiom. \u201cOh? You have Mount Tai here too? Alright then. Since you have even put out this idiom, I\u2019ll give you a chance then. As long as you can answer my question well, I\u2019ll spare you.\u201dThe leader of the Yu clan\u2019s guards was shocked to hear Zu An\u2019s words. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t let them go! They are vile criminals who have slaughtered many innocent people.\u201dZu An rolled his eyes at the leader of the Yu Clan\u2019s guards. \u201cWho gave you permission to speak here? If you want to decide on how to deal with them, why didn\u2019t you capture them earlier?\u201dThe face of the leader of the Yu clan\u2019s guards reddened, but he couldn\u2019t do anything at all. Restrictions had been placed on their bodies, so they were helpless no matter what Zu An wanted to do.You have successfully trolled Yu Bin for +111 Rage!Zu An turned his gaze to one of the black-clothed bandits and asked, \u201cI\u2019ll start from you. What instruments can you play?\u201dThe black-clothed bandit was stunned. \u201cI can\u2019t play the instrument.\u201d Why in the world would bandits like them, who made a living out of plundering, learn how to play instruments?\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of living in the world when you can\u2019t even play good music?\u201d Zu An sneered before ending his life with a swift slit.You have successfully trolled the bandits of the Blackwind Stockade for +666 Rage!Zu An moved on to the person beside him and asked, \u201cWhat about you? What instruments can you play?\u201dThat man swallowed his saliva. He couldn\u2019t play any instruments either, but the corpse of his companion was still fresh beside him. There was no way he would dare to say those words. It was then that a spark flashed across his mind, and he replied, \u201cI can whistle!\u201d\u201cIn what bloody world do you consider whistling to be playing an instrument?\u201d Zu An ended that man\u2019s life with a slit of his dagger too. Even as he breathed his last, there was a fawning smile on that man\u2019s face.You have successfully trolled the bandits of the Blackwind Stockade for +666 Rage!The soft-hearted Ji Xiaoxi couldn\u2019t stand to watch this sight, so she quietly went over and tugged on his sleeves. \u201cBig brother Zu, is it a little too cruel to do this?\u201dZu An sighed deeply. \u201cXiaoxi, you are too kind. If we had fallen into their hands, they would have shown you what true cruelty is. Besides, didn\u2019t I give them a chance for survival over here? As long as they can give me a satisfactory answer to my question, I would spare their lives.\u201dThe bandits from the Blackwind Stockade were all on the verge of crying. How does this count as giving us a chance for survival?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once these bandits recovered from the poison, the tables would surely be turned on him. Naturally, he had to eliminate all danger before then.He felt that he was already kind enough to not torture them like some of those twisted protagonists in the novels he had read in his previous life.Ji Xiaoxi remembered the licentious looks those bandits had directed toward her earlier, and she knew deep down that what Zu An said made perfect sense. So, she held herself back from persuading him anymore.Zu An moved on to the next person. That person shot a glance at his two dead companions before bringing out his spunk and bellowing, \u201cKill me if you want to! Cut that hypocritical crap of what giving us a chance for survival! We\u2019re all bandits, so none of us knows how to play any instruments!\u201dThose words brought a knit between Zu An\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cIs that so? Alright, I\u2019ll switch to another question then. It\u2019s a common sense question that any human should be able to give an answer to.\u201dThe bandit didn\u2019t expect Zu An to suddenly change his questioning style. A hint of delight flickered across his eyes as he said, \u201cFine, ask ahead.\u201dZu An pointed to his own face and asked, \u201cAm I handsome?\u201dThe bandit immediately replied, \u201cDefinitely! I\u2019ve never seen a man as handsome as you. You\u2019re the most handsome man in Brightmoon\u2026 Ah, no, it should be the most handsome man in the entire world! Even the elven princes will kill themselves out of embarrassment in your presence! Err\u2026 Yes, and even the what number one beauty of the capital, Madame Yu, will ovulate right in your presence. Heh, even she wouldn\u2019t be worthy of you\u2026\u201dGiven the current circumstances, even if Zu An had the appearance of an Assrip Wolf, the bandit would have still buttered him up to high heaven.His other bandit companions shot him looks of sympathy, thinking that it must have been hard for him to come up with all of these phrases to bootlick on him.Flames of anger burned in the eyes of the Yu Clan\u2019s guards. After witnessing Zu An\u2019s cruelty, they dared not to direct their rage toward him anymore. So, they could only shoot death glares at that bandit who just uttered those insolent words about their matriarch.You have successfully trolled Yu Yanluo for +99 Rage!Zu An felt a little entertained. This was the first time he was receiving Rage points from Madame Yu. It looked like this bandit had really gone overboard with his bootlicking.Seeing the smile on Zu An\u2019s face, the bandit was overjoyed. He quickly asked, \u201cIs my answer satisfactory to you?\u201d\u201cYou know too much.\u201d Without any hesitation, Zu An moved his dagger and ended his life.You have successfully trolled the bandits of the Blackwind Stockade for +666 Rage!The Yu clan\u2019s guards were dumbstruck. Such a flippant reason works too?Pfft~Slight laughter sounded from the carriage, and it was swiftly muffled. Everything reverted back to silence.Zu An moved on to the fourth bandit and asked, \u201cSame question. Am I handsome?\u201dThat bandit\u2019s eyes swam around the place. The tragic fate that befell the bootlicker was still fresh in his mind. \u201cYou are ugly, but you are overflowing with masculini\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, Zu An had already sliced his throat. \u201cYou must be blind.\u201dYou have successfully trolled the bandits of the Blackwind Stockade for +666 Rage!He moved on to the fifth bandit and asked the same question once more.Seeing how the other two had died regardless of whether they gave a positive answer or a negative answer, this bandit nearly peed his pants when he saw Zu An standing right before him. With a voice quivering in fear, he replied, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dZu An made a quick job out of him. He sighed deeply and remarked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of living in this world when you don\u2019t even know something like this?\u201dYou have successfully trolled the bandits of the Blackwind Stockade for +666 Rage!\u2026Moving from one bandit to the next, it was finally the leader Bao Gang\u2019s turn. \u201cYes, it\u2019s your turn.\u201dBao Gang harrumphed coldly. \u201cI\u2019m going to die no matter what I say. You\u2019re the one who calls the shots anyway. Since that\u2019s the case, why bother putting up this farce? Just kill me then. However, I can assure you that my two brothers will avenge me. They\u2019ll surely tear you into countless pieces!\u201dZu An nodded his head contemplatively before replying with a sigh, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I did go a bit too far earlier.\u201dBao Gang would have cried if not for his final sliver of rationality holding him back. A bit too far? You nearly made me crap in my pants!\u201cHow about we do this then? I\u2019ll give you a question that has a standard answer. As long as you get it right, I promise that I\u2019ll release you,\u201d Zu An said.\u201cAre you serious about that?\u201d Even though Bao Gang knew that it was unlikely for such a thing to occur, his instincts for survival still compelled him to go along with Zu An\u2019s game. After all, it was great just to be alive. He could plunder people\u2019s money and sleep other people\u2019s wives. Once he was dead, there would be none of these anymore.Zu An nodded and replied, \u201cOf course it\u2019s real. This question definitely has a standard answer. If you have any objections to my verdict afterward, I\u2019ll even tell you the correct answer so that you can die in peace.\u201dBao Gang gritted his teeth. \u201cAsk your question.\u201dZu An said, \u201c\u2018To sit before a feast of 300 lychees every day\u2019, what\u2019s the next line after this?\u201d Heh, there\u2019s no way you can possibly answer this ancient poem that came from Earth.Yet, Bao Gang\u2019s eyes lit up in delight. \u201cI know, I know! The next line is \u2018A lifetime I shall be a Lingnan man\u2019.\u201dZu An was stunned. He did feel that the culture in this world was very similar to that of his previous world, but he didn\u2019t think that they would share the same ancient poems too. Didn\u2019t that mean that he couldn\u2019t plagiarize poems like how other transmigrators did to flaunt his literary talent?\u201cWrong!\u201d The livid-faced Zu An raised his dagger and prepared to plunge it right into Bao Gang.Bao Gang immediately screeched in indignance. \u201cImpossible, I have heard of that poem before! \u2018A world of eternal spring beneath Mount Luofu, loquats and bayberries harvested fresh. To sit before a feast of 300 lychees every day, a lifetime I shall be a Lingnan man!\u2019 I definitely got it right! Why don\u2019t you tell me how I\u2019m wrong then?\u201dZu An sneered coldly, \u201cThe next line is clearly \u2018A year I shall eat 109500 lychees\u2019! This is a mathematics question, not a poetry question!\u201d Then, he raised his dagger up high and plunged it down.\u201cYou swindling bastard!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Bao Gang for +1000 Rage!Zu An wiped off the blood on the dagger on his body before exhaling deeply. \u201cNow you know.\u201dGulu~The Yu clan\u2019s guards swallowed their saliva. Did we scold this fellow earlier on too? Shit, we\u2019re goners!However, Zu An didn\u2019t pay any heed to them. Instead, he began ransacking the corpses of Bao Gang and the other bandits.The curious Ji Xiaoxi stepped forward and asked, \u201cBig brother Zu, are you trying to find their tokens to verify their identity?\u201dZu An shook his head and replied, \u201cWhy would I do that? I\u2019m checking if there\u2019s anything valuable on them\u2026 Goddamnit, how is that they don\u2019t even have a single copper coin?!\u201dJi Xiaoxi: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe crowd from the Yu clan: \u201c\u2026\u201dJi Xiaoxi explained weakly, \u201cThese bandits are out to plunder. I don\u2019t think that they would bring their money out with them.\u201dZu An thought that those words made perfect sense, but he still felt an ache in his heart. After all the trouble he had been through and wasting a Poison Bottle, he got nothing in return.What? You are asking about the Rage that they had provided me? Heh, can Rage be eaten as food? It isn\u2019t an accepted currency in this world!All of a sudden, Zu An noticed the shivering guards behind him. He quickly put on what he thought to be a kind smile and asked, \u201cI think it\u2019s only fair for me to pose a question to the rest of you too. Now that I\u2019ve saved your lives, how do you intend to repay me?\u201dThe crowd from the Yu clan felt their souls leaving their bodies. They had seen the tragic fate that had fallen on the bandits of the Blackwind Stockade, and it had left a huge trauma on them too. Just hearing the word \u2018question\u2019 was enough to make them shiver reflexively.\u201cYoung hero, thank you for reaching out a helping hand to us and saving our lives. I am willing to offer you 10,000 gold taels as compensation for your help. May I know if such an arrangement is to your satisfaction?\u201d A feminine voice sounded from the carriage, which had been silent all this while.A graceful hand parted the door curtains, and an absolutely gorgeous woman slowly made her way out from within.Zu An believed that he had a high level of resistance against beautiful women. After all, what kind of beauties had he never seen before in movies, dramas, and all sorts of internet videos in his previous life?Be it Chinese, European, American, or even 2D, he felt that he had already seen everything in the world through his daily swiping of Tiktok videos. As such, he didn\u2019t think that the title of \u2018number one beauty of the capital\u2019 was really anything worthy of note. He felt that it was just a title that a group of countryside bumpkin who didn\u2019t know what true beauty was came up with.However, at this very moment, he realized that he was sorely mistaken about it. No matter how many beauties he had seen through his handphone screen, nothing beat the powerful visual impact of seeing one in real life.The lady that was alighting the carriage had skin so tender that even young girls couldn\u2019t compare with. It felt like her skin was covered in a thin layer of milk, making it both smooth and soft to the touch. Her eyes seemed to reflect the countless stars in the sky, giving off a brilliance that drew people in.Her face was impeccable without any flaws, and she had a long neck that accentuated her grace. Her hair, which was carefully arranged into the shape of a bun, brought out a mature air in her.Zu An\u2019s eyes slowly moved downward and went over her shapely breasts. Her white dress was slightly tightened around her waistline, which brought focus to her slender waist. The curvature from her hip to her waist was so perfect that it made one salivate.Even Ji Xiaoxi couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of inferiority in front of her. Even though those around her always complimented her beauty, she felt that she came nowhere close to matching the mature and elegant disposition that Madame Yu commanded.\u201cDo I look good?\u201d Despite Zu An\u2019s rude, assessing gaze, Madame Yu didn\u2019t lose her temper. Instead, a gentle smile formed on her lips.\u201cYes, you look good,\u201d Zu An replied with a nod. \u201cI thought that I was the best-looking person in this world, but you are just a tier beneath me.\u201dPfft~Ji Xiaoxi failed to curb herself and burst into laughter. The gloomy feeling inside her was swept away in an instant.Yu Yanluo was equally taken aback too. She was used to receiving looks of wonderment from men when they saw her, but none of them acted so\u2026 so naturally.\u201cYou\u2019re an interesting person,\u201d Yu Yanluo chuckled beneath her hand. Her laughter felt warm, like the onset of spring that banished the frost and bloomed the flowers. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? You identified yourself as Cheng Shouping, but that lady over there address you as big brother Zu. I believe the latter should be your real name, right?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the habit of giving my name away after doing a good deed,\u201d Zu An replied with a shake of his head. He gave away Cheng Shouping\u2019s name in order for the latter to carry the blame for whatever he was going to do next. He was currently in a precarious situation in the Chu clan, and until he finally made sense of everything, he didn\u2019t want others to know that he wasn\u2019t as helpless as others thought him out to be.Yu Yanluo looked at the bandit corpses that Zu An ransacked earlier, and her lips curled up charmingly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have that much money with me now. If you don\u2019t tell me your name, how am I going to compensate you what you deserve?\u201dZu An scratched his head in frustration, conflicted over this matter too. But in the end, he still succumbed to the temptation of money. He grabbed Yu Yanluo\u2019s hand and pulled her to one side, \u201cCome with me for a moment!\u201dYu Yanluo glanced at the hand that was grabbing her wrist, and a cold glint flashed across her eyes. But in the end, she still chose not to say anything.Meanwhile, the eyes of the Yu clan\u2019s guards were nearly bulging out from shock. They knew that their matriarch hated coming into contact with any men, but she actually allowed him to grab her without saying anything?Some of them thought of bellowing at the impudent man to have him let go of their matriarch, but just recalling the tragic plight that had happened to the bandits lying all around robbed them of their courage to do so.Zu An pulled Yu Yanluo to a remote corner before he began speaking. \u201cFirst, allow me to clarify myself. I\u2019m not saying this for the sake of the 10,000 gold taels\u2026\u201dBut before he could finish his words, Yu Yanluo shot a glance at his hand and interjected, \u201cCan you let go of my hand first?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Oh, yes. So, I am not the type of person to leave my name behind after doing a good deed, but I can tell that you\u2019re a kind person at heart. Given the sincerity that you have shown me, I fear that you\u2019ll be unable to eat well and sleep in peace if you do not know the name of your benefactor. I\u2019m a soft-hearted person, so I can\u2019t bear to see you being put in a spot. Thus, I am willing to make an exception and share my name with you. However, you have to promise to never divulge my real name to anyone else, including those subordinates of yours.\u201dA glint flashed across Yu Yanluo\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou doubt them?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I doubt them; it\u2019s more about better safe than sorry,\u201d Zu An replied. \u201cI heard from Xiaoxi that the Yu clan is a behemoth known throughout the world, but why are your guards that weak?\u201dIt was not that Zu An was thinking too pessimistically of humans, but someone like Yu Yanluo was bound to stir the hearts of men no matter where she went. There was no way she could remain safe bringing just a group of third rank cultivators led by a fourth rank.Yu Yanluo replied, \u201cThe other guards have other duties on hand, so they were dispatched elsewhere.\u201dZu An looked as if he had expected such an answer. \u201cYou mean to say that the bandits of the Blackwind Stockade happened to assault you while your guards are at the weakest ever? I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s impossible, but don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s too much of a coincidence?\u201dEven if there was no spy amongst the guards, he still didn\u2019t want to take the risk. After all, an additional person knowing his identity meant an additional chance for things to go wrong.Yu Yanluo chuckled softly in response. \u201cYou\u2019re an intelligent person. You probably aren\u2019t just a normal person.\u201dZu An tilted his chin up proudly. \u201cOf course. Didn\u2019t you see me defeating those fellows with a mere flick of my fingers? I, Zu An, am like a deity gazing loftily upon the world. There\u2019s no greater sky higher than me out there. There are millions of Keyboard Immortals out there in the world, but all of them would have to lower their heads before me. As the Keyboard Emperor, it goes without saying that I\u2019m peerless in the world. Who would dare to claim themselves invincible in my presence?\u201dYu Yanluo: \u201c\u2026\u201dSword Immortal? Sword Emperor? While this fellow is indeed quite enigmatic, his cultivation definitely hasn\u2019t reached that level yet. However, his confidence does match the air of an expert.\u201cYour name is Zu An?\u201d Yu Yanluo asked. \u201cWhere do you live? I\u2019ll have my men send the gold to your residence.\u201dThose words left Zu An feeling a headache coming up. To be honest, his identity as the son-in-law of the Chu clan was rather embarrassing, and he didn\u2019t want those in the Chu clan to know too much about him as well. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me your address instead? I\u2019ll drop by and claim the compensation when I\u2019m free.\u201d\u201cFine by me too.\u201d Yu Yanluo wasn\u2019t surprised to hear that Zu An was unwilling to reveal his place of residence. She took out a jade token from her robe and passed it over. \u201cHere, take this.\u201dZu An took the jade token and examined it closely. It had a snowy exterior with an animal carved delicately on it, though he couldn\u2019t recognize what kind of animal it was. It carried lingering warmth and fragrance from Yu Yanluo. Seeing this, he subconsciously asked, \u201cIs this a token of love?\u201dYu Yanluo didn\u2019t lose her patience due to Zu An\u2019s rude words. Instead, she smiled lightly and said, \u201cWhile you\u2019re not too weak, you\u2019ll have to work hard for at least a few years in order to be worthy of becoming my man. This jade token is an insignia. My men will recognize it and allow you to pass if you present it to them.\u201dZu An tucked the jade token into his chest as he remarked, \u201cLook forward to it then. I\u2019ll be knocking on your door a few years from now to become your man.\u201dYu Yanluo burst into laughter. For some reason, she wasn\u2019t put off by this young man\u2019s straightforward attitude.The two of them returned back to the area around the carriage, and they noticed that Ji Xiaoxi was currently squatting by the guards\u2019 side, bandaging their wounds. Zu An leaped in fright, exclaiming, \u201cWhy are they able to move?\u201dJi Xiaoxi blinked her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s because I released the restrictions on them. Their wounds were quite severe, so they needed immediate treatment.\u201d\u201cThank you, Miss Ji.\u201d The guards expressed their earnest gratitude toward Ji Xiaoxi. At the same time, they couldn\u2019t help but wonder why this fairylike lady would get involved with that demonlike scoundrel. What if she were to be led astray by him?That being said, they dared not voice their thoughts aside for fear of offending Zu An. If traumas could be overcome that easily, they wouldn\u2019t be called traumas.\u201cYou mentioned earlier that your father is Divine Physician Ji Dengtu?\u201d Yu Yanluo began assessing Ji Xiaoxi closely. This beautiful yet pure young woman was indeed very likable.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi replied shyly. She found it a little hard to face Yu Yanluo directly due to the pressure from the latter\u2019s mature elegance.\u201cI\u2019ve long heard of Divine Physician Ji\u2019s reputation. I didn\u2019t think that he would have such a ravishing and capable daughter. I really must thank you for your help today.\u201d Yu Yanluo bowed slightly to her.\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t do much at all.\u201d Ji Xiaoxi bowed back in a fluster. \u201cAh right, my father seems to be very fond of you. I thought that the two of you might have met each other before.\u201dYu Yanluo was surprised to hear those words. She had no impression of meeting Divine Physician Ji before. Over the years, there were countless men who constantly dreamed of her after meeting her in person, but hardly any of them had managed to get inside her mind. Perhaps, Ji Dengtu might be one of them too. However, it wouldn\u2019t be good for her to mention something like that before his daughter, so she simply smiled gently and replied, \u201cWe might have met before. It\u2019s just that too many things have happened recently that I forgot about a lot of stuff in the past.\u201dIt was then that the clobbering of horse hooves sounded from a distance away. Zu An\u2019s face immediately turned grave, but Yu Yanluo quickly reassured him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they should be my people.\u201d\u201cThe internal politics of your clan run too deep, so I shan\u2019t get involved in it. Farewell. I\u2019ll drop by your Yu clan one of these days to collect my compensation!\u201d After saying those words, Zu An pulled Ji Xiaoxi away with him.\u201cAh? We\u2019re leaving just like that?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi was a bit bewildered by the sudden departure. They were clearly still hitting it off with one another a moment ago!\u201cJust leave with me first,\u201d Zu An replied. Ji Xiaoxi replied with an \u201cOrh\u201d. While being dragged away by Zu An, she didn\u2019t forget to turn around and wave everyone goodbye.Looking at the departing duo, there was a slight hint of a smile in Yu Yanluo\u2019s beautiful eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s really an interesting lad.\u201dJi Xiaoxi was dragged out of the mountain valley and into the forest. Seeing how Zu An was still holding onto her hands, her face reddened. \u201cYour hand has been poisoned again.\u201dZu An didn\u2019t think too much into it. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any antidote anyway? You can just cure me.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Ji Xiaoxi replied as she blinked her eyes contemplatively. It suddenly dawned on her that there was something amiss about this situation. The medicine on her was specially concocted by her father to protect her from getting taken advantage of, but this fellow touched her body brazenly and even asked her for the antidote.Meanwhile, seeing that they were a safe distance away, Zu An pulled her down into a squatting position beside her and began to assess the situation in the mountain valley.Ji Xiaoxi began curing the poison on his hand as she asked curiously, \u201cWhy do we need to run away?\u201dZu An replied, \u201cYou mention that Madame Yu has just lost her husband, and her carriage was assaulted right after that. It\u2019s clear as day that there\u2019s a force that\u2019s out to get her, and it\u2019s likely that there are insiders in the Yu clan involved in that scheme too. There\u2019s no way of telling whether the arriving reinforcement is intending to save her or to kill her. In any case, it\u2019s best for us not to get embroiled in this mess.\u201dHis situation in the Chu clan was already bad enough, and getting mixed into the politics of another major clan was just going to hasten his death.Ji Xiaoxi immediately got the crux of what Zu An was saying. She nodded in realization as she exclaimed, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that deeply into the situation. Wow, big brother Zu, you are really smart!\u201d\u201cDuh~\u201d Zu An lifted his head up smugly. It felt good to be praised by such a pretty lady, and he waited patiently for the compliments to continue rolling in. However, Ji Xiaoxi was too focused on treating his poison, so there was no sequel to that.Sighing in disappointment, Zu An could only turn his attention back to the mountain valley. A group of knights dressed in white robes with golden stitchings was racing toward the carriage. From their valiant appearances, they looked like fairly powerful cultivators. Many of them emanated an aura that felt even more imposingly than the Third Master of the Blackwind Stockade.The one leading the group of knights was a particularly tall man with sharp eyebrows. His eyes felt severe, but his carefully trimmed mustache mellowed down his sharpness and gave him a scholarly vibe.\u201cSister-in-law, I\u2019m sorry for coming late. I hope that you\u2019re still safe!\u201d Upon seeing Yu Yanluo, that man quickly got down from his horse and rushed to her side with a concerned look on his face.\u201cHe\u2019s her brother-in-law?\u201d Zu An muttered. Considering that Yu Yanluo\u2019s husband had just passed away, a young, beautiful widow together with her suave, dashing brother-in-law\u2026 it was hard to not think deeply into it. \u201cXiaoxi, who\u2019s that guy over there?\u201dJi Xiaoxi shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be helped since she was still young, and it wasn\u2019t like she devoted her time to prying into the affairs of others. It was only natural for her to not be familiar with the intricate web of relationships within the Yu clan.Yu Yanluo replied nonchalantly, \u201cI\u2019m fine, let\u2019s head to the city first.\u201d Then, she got back onto her carriage.The mustache man was left standing alone in the field, and a hint of anger flashed across his eyes. However, he swiftly reined it in and gestured to his subordinates to help the wounded onto a horse. After that, he gave the order for the group to set off.\u201cSister-in-law, may I ask how were those bandits from the Blackwind Stockade killed?\u201d The mustached man rode his horse beside the carriage and asked through the window.\u201cI\u2019m a little exhausted. Let\u2019s talk about it later,\u201d Yu Yanluo replied with a slightly lazy voice.The mustached man frowned after hearing her response. His face looked incredibly livid.Taking the interactions of the duo into account, Zu An stroked his lower jaws contemplatively.After watching the family drama of the Yu clan, Zu An and Ji Xiaoxi began making their way back to the city too. There was nothing else that happened on their way back. Once they were in the city, Ji Xiaoxi turned her head over and said, \u201cBig brother Zu, you should come home with me. I\u2019ll get my father to take a look at your condition.\u201dAs she spoke, her eyes subconsciously glanced downward toward his crotch. Her unwitting action made Zu An\u2019s face darken. Are you going to do this every time?Zu An was indeed planning to head over to Divine Physician Ji\u2019s place, so he wouldn\u2019t refuse her request. He looked at the sky and noticed that it was already starting to darken. He wondered if there was any curfew in the Chu clan, and whether he would be locked out of the door if he returned too late.Even if that\u2019s the case, I should be able to get Ji Xiaoxi to take me in for the night, right?But thinking about her father\u2019s attitude, it didn\u2019t seem that reliable of a plan anymore.With some worries in his mind, the two of them made their way to the Ji Residence. Before reaching their destination, a person suddenly shouted, \u201cMiss Ji is back! Miss Ji is back!\u201dThe crowd which had been camping at the entrance of the Ji Residence immediately crowded around her.\u201cMiss Ji, please help me take a look over here.\u201d\u201cMiss Ji, please diagnose me first. I was the first one to arrive here!\u201d\u201cMiss Ji, my illness is far more severe than the others!\u201d\u2026It wasn\u2019t Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s first time being surrounded by so many people, but she still couldn\u2019t help but feel a little uncomfortable with this. Her face flushed as she said, \u201cCalm down, everyone. Queue up. I\u2019ll look at you all one by one.\u201dZu An was honestly a little impressed. He had heard from Cheng Shouping that Ji Xiaoxi was very popular amongst the people, but it was only seeing it in person that he really understood what it meant to be loved by the populace. Every single one of these people here sincerely cherished and respected her.That being said, Zu An felt that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. This lass was all good except for her soft personality. These people were obviously taking advantage of her kindness to get treated for free. It was no wonder why Divine Physician Ji treated them so harshly earlier.[1] Keyboard and sword have similar pronunciations in Chinese.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cBig brother Zu, you should head in and look for my father first. Tell him that you\u2019re my friend. I\u2019ll join you once I\u2019m done treating the patients here,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi told Zu An apologetically while handling the crowd gathered before her.\u201cAlright.\u201d This was what Zu An intended too. Otherwise, if Ji Xiaoxi were to \u2018match testimonies\u2019 with Divine Physician Ji, the lies that he had spun would be exposed right away.As the crowd had already moved over to Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s side, the previously flooded entrance of the Ji Residence suddenly looked incredibly empty. Even the rocking chair placed at the entrance was empty too. Clearly, Divine Physician Ji had already retired back into his residence.Zu An reported the reason behind his visit, and a servant quickly led him in. He was brought into a courtyard, where the servant gestured toward one of the rooms and said, \u201cThe old master is in there. You may enter alone.\u201dDivine Physician Ji disallowed servants like them to enter the areas where he concocted medicine since they were important locations. As for the threat of outsiders possibly harming Divine Physician Ji, that worry was for naught. There was no one in Brightmoon City who would dare to mess around here.Zu An pushed the door open and entered the room. He heard crude laughter coming from within, and his expression turned a little odd. After walking in a little more, he noticed that Divine Physician Ji was not concocting medicine but lying on a chair, browsing through a suspicious-looking book. Most likely, it was that erotic book that someone had bribed him with earlier in the morning.Seeing his perverted look and hearing the goosebump-inducing laughter, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but wonder how this vulgar middle-aged man gave birth to someone as sweet as Ji Xiaoxi.\u201cHm? You returned earlier than I thought. Did you manage to gather all of the goubaos?\u201d Divine Physician Ji\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t leave the book for even a moment, but he was still able to identify Zu An accurately.\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any goubao with me,\u201d Zu An replied.\u201cTsk. What are you doing here then? Scram scram scram, don\u2019t interrupt me while I\u2019m reading my book.\u201d Divine Physician Ji shook his leg leisurely as he waved Zu An away impatiently.Zu An took out a stack of banknotes and waved them around. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t have any goubaos, I do have money with me. You want it?\u201d\u201cHeh, why should I decline money that\u2019s delivered to my doorstep?\u201d As swift as a hurricane, Divine Physician Ji stood up from his rocking chair and snatched the bank notes away from Zu An\u2019s hands. It was exactly 100 silver taels. \u201cYou were a poor bloke earlier. How did you manage to strike it rich all of a sudden? Hm? Why do these bank notes look oddly familiar\u2026\u201dZu An began sweating upon hearing those words. Is this man so obsessed with money that he can even recognize his own money? Fearing that Divine Physician Ji would discover that he had obtained these banknotes from Ji Xiaoxi, he quickly changed the topic and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already paid you the consultation fee. It\u2019s your turn to treat me.\u201dDivine Physician Ji tucked the banknotes into his clothes before saying, \u201cAlright then. On the account that you have delivered money right into my hands, I\u2019ll be gracious and help me take a look at it. Take off your pants!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zu An was stunned.\u201cAh what ah? How am I going to check on your condition if you don\u2019t take off your pants?\u201d Divine Physician Ji shot Zu An a disdainful look. It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re a babe. Do you think that I\u2019m that interested in looking at you?\u201cWeren\u2019t you able to diagnose my condition just by taking a look at me earlier in the morning?\u201d Zu An found it hard to accept the fact that he had to take off his pants before another guy.\u201cI could only tell that there\u2019s a seal planted on your body. If I don\u2019t take a close look, how am I supposed to tell what kind of seal it is?\u201d Divine Physician Ji grumbled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take it off, so be it.\u201d\u201cFine fine, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Zu An cried out tearfully. His happiness was banking on this, so he could only put his pride aside for the time being. Considering how this middle-aged man was looking at an erotic magazine happily earlier on, it should be safe to assume that he didn\u2019t swing the other way.\u201cOho, it looks quite delicate,\u201d Divine Physician Ji remarked casually.Black streaks flashed across Zu An\u2019s face. If not for the fact that I\u2019m no match for you, I\u2019d have surely pressed you down to the ground and pummeled you by now!Divine Physician Ji returned back to his chair and said, \u201cYou need not worry. It\u2019s just that you have been struck by the Great Yinyang Pulse Severing Palm, which affected your development. As long as the seal on your body is removed, you\u2019ll revert back to normal.\u201dZu An felt a surge of joy in his heart. There\u2019s still hope! He quickly pulled up his pants and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Great Yinyang Pulse Severing Palm? How do I get rid of the seal?\u201dDivine Physician Ji replied, \u201cBased on what I know, it\u2019s a domineering sealing palm strike that has been passed down in the royal palace. As long as you raise your cultivation to the Master stage, you\u2019ll be able to tear through the seal with ease.\u201dZu An nearly spurted blood. In the end, he was still getting the same answer as before. What the hell was he working so hard for then? \u201cI know that too. I wouldn\u2019t have bothered consulting you if I could reach Master stage that easily. Return me my money! It looks like your reputation as a divine physician is a mere exaggeration!\u201d\u201cHeh. There are only a few Masters in the world, so even if you luck out and reach that level, I reckon that you would already have one foot in the grave by then. You wouldn\u2019t be able to put that thing to use anymore,\u201d Divine Physician Ji mocked gleefully. \u201cForget it. Seeing how pitiful you are\u2026 I do have another way to treat you. However, it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d\u201cWhat way is it? No matter how hard it is, I\u2019ll definitely do it!\u201d Zu An nearly cried out of relief. Just as he thought that he had reached a dead end, a new door suddenly opened right before him!\u201cTsk. Given your capabilities, what can you possibly do?\u201d Divine Physician Ji sneered in disdain. \u201cForget it, I\u2019ll think of a way myself. However, you have to do something for me first before I\u2019ll save you.\u201d\u201cWhat? But I already paid you the treatment fee!\u201d Zu An exclaimed indignantly.\u201cWhat treatment fee? It\u2019s called consultation fee for a reason!\u201d Divine Physician Ji glared at Zu An coldly. \u201cWhat I\u2019m accepting now is the treatment fee! Have you never seen a physician before?\u201dZu An finally understood why this middle-aged man had so many patients hollering at his doorstep every day. However, he couldn\u2019t bother too much about that right now. He quickly continued asking, \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any hobbies in my life except to collect the dudous of beautiful women\u2026\u201d Before Divine Physician Ji could finish his words, Zu An had already raised his middle finger in contempt. \u201cYou\u2019re such a repulsive man.\u201d(Dudou is the undergarment worn by women in the older era.)\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be treated anymore?\u201d Divine Physician Ji sneered.Zu An quickly changed his attitude and said, \u201cEsteemed physician, please continue speaking.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it. If you can get the dudou of Cloudmidst Commandery\u2019s Yu Yanluo\u2026\u201d Divine Physician Ji quickly shook his head upon speaking up to this point. \u201cForget it, you probably have never stepped out of Brightmoon City before, so how could you possibly come into contact with that sort of legendary figure? Let\u2019s see\u2026 The Chu clan\u2019s matriarch, Qin Wanru, Brightmoon Academy\u2019s teacher, Shang Liuyu, or Immortal Abode\u2019s courtesan, Qiu Huolei\u2026 Well, if you can obtain any single one of their dudous, I\u2019ll accept it as the treatment fee.\u201dZu An\u2019s eyes widened in horror. He hadn\u2019t heard of the latter two, but he did know Qin Wanru. He gulped down a mouthful of saliva and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of the Brightmoon Duke learning that you\u2019re interested in his wife? He\u2019ll pin you onto the floor and beat you up!\u201d\u201cWhat does he count as? Do I look like I\u2019ll be afraid of me?\u201d Divine Physician Ji replied proudly.\u201cIf you\u2019re that formidable, why don\u2019t you obtain their dudous yourself?\u201d Zu An sneered.Divine Physician Ji coughed a little before replying, \u201cI\u2019m, after all, a divine physician. I need to uphold my reputation! How can I do something as underhanded as that? Listen well! This matter should only be known between you and me. If anyone else were to find out about it, not only will I not admit to it, but I\u2019ll make sure that the town learns about your ED!\u201dZu An flew into a state of rage. \u201cWho are you saying has ED?\u201dDivine Physician Ji shot a glance at Zu An\u2019s crotch and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try getting it up then?\u201d\u201cHeh, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re some hot lady. I must be out of my mind to get it up to you!\u201d Zu An hollered in anger.Divine Physician Ji wrapped his arm around Zu An\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cAlright, stop being so stubborn. Accomplish what I ask of you, and I\u2019ll make sure you become a healthy man once more.\u201dZu An\u2019s face flickered across many emotions for a moment, and in the end, he replied reluctantly, \u201cFine!\u201dFor his own happiness, he could only go all out here!Zu An didn\u2019t know how he got out of the Ji Residence. His mind was completely preoccupied with the hell-level mission he has just received that he even forgot to bid Ji Xiaoxi farewell.He hadn\u2019t heard of Shang Liuyu and Qin Huolei, but Qin Wanru\u2026 Gah\u2026Recalling the incident in the ancestral hall earlier in the day, he began cursing at Ji Dengtu\u2019s horrible taste. Qin Wanru was admittedly beautiful, but her temper was the worst.On top of that, Qin Wanru was his mother-in-law. If he were to be caught stealing her dudou, putting aside Chu Zhongtian, even Chu Chuyan would skin him alive!Just imagining the terrifying sight was enough to make him instantly dispel such thoughts.So, all that was left was Yu Yanluo. It was a huge coincidence that he had saved her not too long ago. That being said, if he were to knock on her door and ask for her undergarment, wouldn\u2019t he be thrown out of her residence right away?Damn it, that perverted old man! Why the hell did he come up with such dastardly terms?Shortly after Zu An left, Ji Xiaoxi finally finished treating all of her patients and rushed back into the residence. However, she realized that only her father was left, so she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s him?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Divine Physician Ji asked.\u201cZu An. He didn\u2019t come in?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi asked worriedly.\u201cAh, that fellow. I have already sent him off.\u201d Divine Physician Ji eyed his daughter suspiciously. \u201cYou know him?\u201d\u201cYeah, I met him on the road. He helped me,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi replied.A furrow formed on Divine Physician Ji\u2019s forehead as he said, \u201cStay away from him in the future. There\u2019s no such thing as a good man in the world. I know just what kind of dirty thoughts that are running through his head.\u201dJi Xiaoxi\u2019s face reddened. \u201cHe isn\u2019t like any other men.\u201dDivine Physician Ji chuckled at those words. \u201cHeh, he\u2019s indeed different from other men. I guess it\u2019s fine too. You have nothing to lose hanging out with him.\u201dFrom her father\u2019s words, Ji Xiaoxi realized that Zu An had already been diagnosed. She anxiously asked, \u201cCan he be treated?\u201d\u201cOf course! Who do you think your father is?\u201d Divine Physician Ji said smugly as he stroked his beard. \u201cHowever, his condition is a little troublesome. I\u2019ll need to spend some time thinking over it.\u201dA smile blossomed on Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s lips. \u201cYes, I believe in father\u2019s capabilities. Ah, speaking of which, I managed to procure some Assrip Wolf goubaos. Weren\u2019t you looking for them for the medicine you\u2019re planning to concoct?\u201dDivine Physician Ji was taken aback for a moment. He quickly rushed forward to check on the goods, and he realized that there were indeed Assrip Wolf goubaos. His face immediately turned livid. \u201cYou went to the Wolf Valley? What if something happened to you? You shouldn\u2019t put yourself at risk for something like this!\u201dHe had given something to his daughter to repel wild beasts, but if she were to take the initiative to provoke and kill an Assrip Wolf, the rest of the pack wouldn\u2019t just turn a blind eye to it. She could have been in great danger due to that!Ji Xiaoxi replied with a sweet smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t hunt those Assrip Wolves. I bought them from someone else.\u201dDivine Physician Ji heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he asked curiously, \u201cWho\u2019s so capable as to be able to gather so many goubaos?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s big brother Zu An who came in earlier. He didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d Ji Xiaoxi asked in confusion.\u201cYou bought them from Zu An?\u201d Divine Physician Ji swiftly sensed that something was very fishy here. He hurriedly took out the notes he had just received as he asked, \u201cHow much did he sell them for?\u201d\u201cA-around 12 silver taels each,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi replied stutteringly.\u201cGoddamnit! That brat actually sold it to you at such a high price?\u201d All of a sudden, Divine Physician Ji felt like the banknotes he was holding were laughing at him. How did a hawk like him end up getting done in by a mere worm?!\u201cActually, it isn\u2019t that expensive. This stuff can\u2019t be easily bought in the market after all,\u201d Ji Xiaoxi replied with a reddened face. She was glad that she reported slightly a lower price, or else her father would surely hold a grudge against big brother Zu.\u201cHow did I give birth to such a dumb lass!\u201d Divine Physician Ji cried out as he returned back to his room. Just seeing the naive look on his daughter's face was enough to exasperate him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She suddenly noticed the book on the chair. Out of curiosity, she picked it up and took a glance at it. Just seeing the content of a single page was more than enough to turn her face as red as an apple. She quickly ran up to her father and shouted, \u201cFather, how can you read this sort of improper stuff? If my little aunt were to see it, she\u2019ll start arguing with you again!\u201dIt was then that Ji Dengtu remembered that he had left behind his stuff. He quickly snatched the book over from Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s hands before saying, \u201cHmph! I have already parted with your mother a long time ago; your little aunt can\u2019t do anything about me!\u201dJi Xiaoxi stomped her foot angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s because you always act in such a manner that little aunt doesn\u2019t come here anymore.\u201d\u201cPui! Who wants her to come? You don\u2019t know just how carefree I am these days!\u201d Ji Dengtu waved his hands impatiently, not wanting to talk about this matter at all. \u201cYou should sleep early tonight. You\u2019ll be returning to the academy tomorrow. Let\u2019s see how you\u2019re going to complain to your little aunt by then!\u201dJi Dengtu rushed back to his room and closed the door to seek refuge.On the other hand, Zu An had just gotten back to the Chu clan when he suddenly received a notification.You have successfully trolled Ji Dengtu for +345 Rage!Zu An giggled a little. It seemed like Divine Physician Ji had found out that he had sold his goubaos to Ji Xiaoxi. To be honest, he did feel a little guilty for scamming that kind young woman.Returning back to his room, Zu An fetched himself a bowl of water and washed his face and hands, the usual ritual before trying his hand at the lottery. It was then that an old man suddenly walked in. This old man was dressed tidily; there wasn\u2019t the slightest crease to be seen in his clothes. His white hair was combed neatly in place, which was indicative of his strict character.Zu An was taken aback by the sudden appearance of this old man. He vaguely remembered the latter to be the Chu clan\u2019s butler, Hong Zhong. He was a loyal and responsible person, deeply trusted by the patriarch of the Chu clan.\u201cIs there something up?\u201d Zu An asked.Hong Zhong shot an assessing look at Zu An before finally revealing his intentions here, \u201cBy the instructions of the Master, you\u2019re to head to the academy once you have fully recovered from your injuries. Shouping will lead you there tomorrow morning, so I\u2019ll have to ask young master to make preparations for that.\u201dZu An was stunned. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t recovered from my injuries yet. Aiyoo, it hurts\u2026\u201d You must be kidding me! I still have plenty of things to do, so how can I waste my time on studies?Hong Zhong said nonchalantly, \u201cYoung master, you need not put on an act. An injured person wouldn\u2019t head out to play for an entire day. This matter isn\u2019t up for discussion. Someone will be escorting you to the academy tomorrow morning.\u201dZu An was surprised that the butler actually knew about this matter, but all of a sudden, he noticed Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes swimming all around the place, not daring to meet him in the eye. He immediately felt rage surging in his heart. That fellow mentioned that he would keep it a secret, yet he sold me out in less than a day!Hong Zhong continued to instruct Zu An for a few more matters before taking his leave, leaving Zu An and Cheng Shouping to stare at one another.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you keep secrets like a cork in a bottle?\u201d Zu An clenched his fists so tightly together that one could hear creaking sounds.Cheng Shouping immediately rushed over to massage his back. With a fawning smile, he explained, \u201cThe butler dropped by to check on young master\u2019s injuries, but young master wasn\u2019t around. He caught me and started grilling me. What can I do? I didn\u2019t intend for things to end like this either.\u201dZu An scoffed coldly, \u201cBut what did you promise me before?\u201dCheng Shouping quickly explained, \u201cYoung master, I didn\u2019t say a single word about you heading to Divine Physician Ji\u2019s place to check on your injuries. No matter how he threatened or bribed me, I didn\u2019t give in at all!\u201dZu An was so furious that he almost felt like laughing. \u201cSo, I should be thanking you instead, huh?\u201d\u201cAhahaha, you don\u2019t need to go that far.\u201d Cheng Shouping replied as he fiddled with his fingers shyly. \u201cHowever, if you really want to reward me, I\u2019m not against it either\u2026\u201dZu An slapped Cheng Shouping on his head. \u201cYou really think that I\u2019m complimenting you?!\u201dThe indignant Cheng Shouping quickly supported the two buns on his head to prevent them from dropping down. With a wronged voice, he complained, \u201cYoung master, can you not hit my head? Like I told you before, this hairdo is incredibly difficult to make.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me in that tone!\u201d Zu An felt shivers running down his spine from sheer disgust. \u201cAh right, where did my wife go?\u201d I\u2019ve been out for an entire day now. I wonder if that lass misses me or not.\u201cWhat wife?\u201d Cheng Shouping blinked his eyes in confusion.Zu An: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Cheng Shouping widened her eyes in realization. \u201cAh! You\u2019re referring to the First Miss! She went out with the young miss of the Pei clan earlier in the morning, and when she returned, she received news that a problem had cropped up with the family business, so she headed out to settle it. The First Miss has really been working hard recently. She\u2019s the one supporting half of the Chu clan\u2019s businesses, and there are so many things that require her to attend to. It would have been so much easier if she is a guy.\u201dZu An\u2019s face darkened. \u201cAre you asking for a beating? If she\u2019s a guy, what am I here for?\u201d\u201cYoung master, that\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied as he humbly poured a cup of tea for Zu An to apologize for his mistakes.Somehow, Zu An felt a really strong urge to pummel Cheng Shouping when he saw the latter acting in such a manner. He finally understood why he, from serving as Chu Zhongtian\u2019s attendant, would end up being sent to the kitchen. \u201cAh right, what\u2019s with Miss Pei?\u201dHe still remembered how that woman nearly caused his death back at the ancestral hall with just a few words, but for some reason, he found it hard to hate her. It was not that he was forgiving, but hers was simply too big!\u201cOhhh~ Young master, you\u2019re such a naughty person. Are you lusting over the First Miss\u2019 friend?\u201d Cheng Shouping looked at Zu An with a knowing look as he intentionally stretched his voice out suggestively. \u201cWell, Miss Pei is indeed very attractive. There were no men in our estate who could keep their eyes off her when she visited earlier on. Young master, I\u2019m rooting for you!\u201dZu An was rendered speechless. \u201cIt\u2019s really a miracle that the Chu clan didn\u2019t send you to the royal palace to serve as a eunuch.\u201dCheng Shouping\u2019s smile froze up. \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t scare me!\u201dZu An couldn't be bothered to waste his breath with him. \u201cWho asked you whether she\u2019s good-looking or not? What I want is information on her!\u201d\u201cAccording to rumors, Miss Pei appears to be from Eastriver\u2019s Pei clan. That\u2019s a massive clan with over a thousand years of heritage behind them, boasting a history even longer than our Chu clan. She\u2019s on good terms with our First Miss, and it seems like she\u2019s here to study in Brightmoon Academy,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied.Zu An was stunned. \u201cShe\u2019s here to study too?\u201d The private academy of the Chu clan actually accepted outsiders as well? But again, considering her close ties with Chu Chuyan, it was not all that surprising.\u201cOf course! Our Brightmoon Academy is renowned far and wide. Those from the other commanderies often come here in hopes of pursuing an education there!\u201d Cheng Shouping said proudly.Zu An couldn\u2019t understand why Cheng Shouping was feeling so proud about an academy he wasn\u2019t even involved with, but he was rather surprised to hear that the Brightmoon Academy was actually so well-known. It seemed like his father-in-law was quite a prideful person.However, this wasn\u2019t the important thing right now. He had to focus his attention on clearing the task assigned to him by Divine Physician Ji first!Damn it, that Ji Dengtu is really a bloody pervert!Zu An cursed him once more in his heart before he continued asking, \u201cDo you know Yu Yanluo?\u201d\u201cYu Yanluo?\u201d Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOf course! She used to be the number one beauty in the capital back in those years! You don\u2019t know how many men view her as their dream lover!\u201d\u201cFor a study companion, you know far too much\u2026\u201d Zu An eyed Cheng Shouping doubtfully.Cheng Shouping quickly shot glances at his surroundings before leaning closer to Zu An. \u201cYoung master, let me tell you a secret that you mustn\u2019t tell anyone. Actually, the old master used to be one of Yu Yanluo\u2019s pursuers, but he failed in the end.\u201dZu An was astonished. He didn\u2019t think that there would be such a relationship between Yu Yanluo and Chu Zhongtian. Recalling the beautiful figure he met in the valley earlier in the day, she clearly didn\u2019t look very old. Yet, she was actually from the same generation as Chu Zhongtian?\u201cThe old mistress flies into rage every time this matter is mentioned. The old master nearly had his ears torn off on several occasions!\u201d Cheng Shouping chuckled under his hands.Zu An rolled his eyes. His thoughts had been verified. It turned out that his father-in-law was already being very merciful for banishing Cheng Shouping to the kitchen. It was no wonder why this fellow was eventually assigned as his study companion. With such loose lips, there was no one in the estate who could possibly tolerate him!\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re the only one that I\u2019ve told this matter to. You mustn\u2019t tell anyone else about this!\u201d Cheng Shouping reminded him.Zu An sneered coldly upon hearing these words. He was willing to bet 5 copper coins that the whole estate already knew about this matter.\u201cWhere does Yu Yanluo stay in Brightmoon City?\u201d Zu An asked. He had to find an opportunity to visit her. Even if not for Ji Dengtu\u2019s task, he should at least claim his compensation for saving her.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t stay in Brightmoon City,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied in confusion. \u201cShe married the Cloudmidst Duke, so she should be staying at the Cloudmidst Commandery.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zu An was astonished. Is this a scam? Have I been given an empty cheque?\u201cHowever, their clan deals in ki stones, and they have branches in all of the major cities. They have one in Brightmoon City too. Perhaps, she might come by for an inspection one of these days,\u201d Cheng Shouping added.Zu An finally heaved a sigh of relief. It was relieving to hear that. If he wasn\u2019t wrong, Yu Yanluo should be staying in Brightmoon City over the next few days, which meant that he had some time to collect his money.He continued asking a few more questions before sending Cheng Shouping away.After verifying that no one else was around, he summoned his keyboard out once more and checked on his Rage points. Earlier, after he drew out all of the Marrow Cleansing Pills from the lottery, he still had 3000 Rage points left. Following that, he earned quite a bit from the Yu clan\u2019s guards and the Blackwind Stockade\u2019s bandits. All in all\u2026Current Rage Points: 22269.Woah, I have struck it rich!Feeling like a tycoon, Zu An immediately began drawing the lottery.As expected, the first one was \u2018Thanks for playing!\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I have money!\u201d Zu An thought little of it and continued drawing the lottery.Thanks for playing\u2026 Thanks for playing\u2026It was till the thirteenth time that the light finally stopped on keycap \u20184\u2019.Zu An heaved a sigh of relief. He had just verified the importance of not raising a flag on himself.Noticing that the number the light stopped on this time around was different from before, he quickly took a closer look, only to see a fruit that was giving off a golden glow from its core.According to the explanation: Ki Fruit. It raises the ki capacity of a cultivator.With Zu An\u2019s great experience with games in his previous life, he immediately understood the purpose of this fruit. Basically, it was similar to EXP potions.Such good stuff ought to go into his stomach right away so that his mind could rest in peace. Thus, Zu An immediately took it out and swallowed it. Unexpectedly, there was no splashing of juice. Instead, the fruit seemed to melt as soon as it entered his mouth, and a stream of ki swiftly suffused his body. Soon, this stream of ki appeared to be drawn in by something and surged straight toward the fourth formation on his skin.The fourth formation was much larger than the previous three. Even after the stream of ki fully assimilated into the formation, it was only filled by a third.\u201cJust this much?\u201d Zu An was dissatisfied with the results. Despite sounding so formidable, its effects were still inferior to the whipping he got.He couldn\u2019t help but feel a little frustrated. It can\u2019t be that I\u2019ve to rely on whipping in order to raise my cultivation level, right? That would be so wrong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe main reason why Zu An was dissatisfied with the effects of the Ki Fruit was due to his lack of common sense when it came to cultivation. One must know that ordinary cultivators in this world had to spend months or even years cultivating in order to raise their cultivation by a single step. Even Plum Blossom Twelve had trained diligently for over two decades in order to reach his current level, only to be caught up by Zu An overnight.There was probably no one in this world who wouldn\u2019t be shocked by the current rate at which Zu An was growing.On top of that, the Phoenix Nirvana Scroll, aside from being able to activate the keyboard, was no ordinary artifact. It offered the cultivator the unconventional method of raising his cultivation through undergoing beating, and its effects also far surpassed that of most cultivation techniques. It was due to the lack of a realistic contrast that Zu An thought that Ki Fruit was less incredible than it truly was.Zu An continued drawing the lottery, and it was yet another Ki Fruit. In the end, after using up 22,200 Rage points, he drew a total of 16 Ki Fruits.\u201cIs this the only thing I can draw from now onward?\u201d Zu An muttered in disdain. Doing a quick calculation, on average, he obtained a Ki Fruit every 14 draws.He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the chances of obtaining a prize were 1-in-10 or 1-in-20. If it was the former, he was really darned unlucky. If it was the latter, it seemed like his luck was still fairly good.Considering how handsome I am, it must be the latter!Zu An swallowed the Ki Fruits one after another. He used a total of 3 Ki Fruits to fill up the fourth formation, 5 Ki Fruits for the fifth formation, and 8 Ki Fruits for the sixth formation. With that, he finished all of his Ki Fruits.One thing that Zu An couldn\u2019t help but notice was that the number of Ki Fruit he needed to fill up his formations looked oddly familiar to him. Wait a moment, isn\u2019t this the Fibonacci sequence?As a qualified keyboard warrior, he had to be familiar with all sorts of complicated-sounding terms on the internet so that he could appear smart on the internet forums. He was aware that there was a lot of things in the natural world that obeyed the Fibonacci sequence, such as the arrangements of cones, pineapples, tree leaves, number of petals on a sunflower, beehives, wings of a dragonfly, the golden rectangle, the golden ratio, and so on.However, he didn\u2019t expect this golden finger of his to obey the golden ratio too. Was the Fibonacci sequence actually some hidden rule of the universe?Zu An couldn\u2019t feel happy about this discovery as he knew that the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence grew exponentially bigger down the sequence, which meant that the amount of Ki Fruits he would need in the later stages could potentially reach an astronomical sum.He suddenly recalled the Marrow Cleansing Pills he had eaten earlier in the day, and he felt gladdened that he had increased his talent. Otherwise, if he had to rely solely on Ki Fruits, he would be doomed!In the end, it was still much more reliable for him to get beaten up instead.Zu An did a quick calculation, and he found that the rate at which his cultivation grew when he was struck by the Wailing Whip was faster than when he ate the Ki Fruit, and his talent was only at lower Ding back then!But again, he couldn\u2019t possibly look for a woman to beat him up every day, right?Heaving a deep sigh, Zu An reached out to get himself a cup of water to drink. Unexpectedly, when he grabbed the cup, the cup suddenly shattered in his hands. This made him blink his eyes blankly. It took a while before he realized that this was a result of a sudden increase in his strength.Out of curiosity, he did a few more experiments to test out his strength. In the midst of doing so, he gradually grew accustomed to the changes in his body.Back when he was at the third step of the second rank, his strength was roughly equivalent to that of 4 adult men. However, now that he was in the sixth step of the second rank, his strength was comparable to that of 20 adult men combined.All of a sudden, Zu An suddenly thought of something. He took out a paper and wrote down a couple of numbers to do some calculations. When he finally put down his brush once more, there was a conflicted look on his face. It really obeys the Fibonacci sequence. If I total all of the numbers in the sequence before, it adds up to 20.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d A sinister voice suddenly sounded by the doorway.Zu An lifted his head and saw Old Mi standing at the entrance of the room. His skin still looked withered like dried orange skin, and he was so thin that it felt like he was going to be blown away by the wind.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d However, Zu An dared not to look down on him. His instincts were telling him that this enigmatic old man was a dangerous person to mess with.Hm? Why would I think that he\u2019s dangerous? Is it because he looks ugly?But of course, Zu An wouldn\u2019t voice those thoughts aloud. Even a keyboard warrior had to prioritize his survival over earning Rage points.\u201cHmm, you seem to have grown stronger,\u201d Old Mi looked at him in astonishment. He\u2019s able to make a breakthrough yet again so swiftly. It seems like the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra is indeed formidable.\u201cI fought with a few people when I went out earlier in the day,\u201d Zu An replied with an honest look on his face.\u201cTry striking me once.\u201d Old Mi didn\u2019t doubt Zu An, though a huge part of the reason was due to him thinking that the latter still didn\u2019t have any other means to raise his cultivation.\u201cThis\u2026 I dare not do so.\u201d While Old Mi was likely to be an expert, Zu An still couldn\u2019t help but feel bad making a move against this frail-looking old man. It would be horrible if something were to go wrong.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry, just use your full might against me. You aren\u2019t able to hurt me yet,\u201d Old Mi said.\u201cI\u2019ll be striking you then.\u201d Zu An also felt that he was worrying in vain. Thus, he gathered his strength and hurled a punch toward Old Mi\u2019s chest.However, he didn\u2019t use his full strength, exerting just a third of his might. As a keyboard warrior, it is unbecoming to reveal all of my cards. Hiding behind a veil of anonymity\u2026 Pui pui pui! I mean, surviving till the very end is the most important thing of all!Other than that, he also wanted to verify one of his guesses too.Old Mi raised his hand shakily, but he was able to block his fist without any trouble. \u201cNot bad, not bad. You have already reached the fourth step of the second rank.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zu An exclaimed in astonishment. Just as I thought, it\u2019s very difficult for outsiders to tell my cultivation level with the naked eye. It\u2019s the same as the last time. He was only able to discern what cultivation level I am at after seeing my punch.That being said, it was still possible for a stronger cultivator to roughly tell what rank a weaker cultivator was at.\u201cGiven your rate of cultivation, it\u2019s not entirely impossible for you to reach the Master stage in the future.\u201d Old Mi\u2019s eyes were filled with delight. He thought that Zu An was untalented, but who could have thought that he was actually a good bud? It shouldn\u2019t take long before the latter was ready to be possessed.Old Mi chuckled to himself before saying, \u201cI heard that you\u2019re heading to Brightmoon Academy tomorrow?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Zu An replied with a stifled look on his face. There was bound to be plenty of cousins and relatives from the side branches of the Chu clan there as well. By then, his identity as the Chu clan\u2019s son-in-law was likely to bring in a great deal of trouble. At the very least, that was how the plot usually went in novels.What Zu An feared right now wasn\u2019t trouble but wasting his time. He had too many things he needed to accomplish right now.\u201cOnce you arrive at the academy, look for a child named Wei Hongde. No matter how you go about doing it, make sure to build a good relationship with him. It\u2019ll be best if you can become his friend,\u201d Old Mi said slowly.\u201cWei Hongde?\u201d Zu An repeated the name once more. \u201cWho is that? Is he your cousin? What\u2019s the reason behind getting close to him?\u201d\u201cYou need not bother about that. Remember, make sure not to reveal my identity to anyone else,\u201d Old Mi replied with a smile. It was just that his smile looked exceptionally eerie with that withered face of his. \u201cI imparted a secret art to you, so it isn\u2019t too much of me to ask something like that of you, right?\u201d\u201cOf course not! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely do my best to get close to him!\u201d Zu An\u2019s smile was as earnest as it could possibly get. On the inside, however, he was curious as to whether the Chu clan\u2019s private academy would really accept an outsider with a different surname. Could he be a drafted son-in-law, just like me?\u201cAlright, you should rest well.\u201d Old Mi patted his shoulder before leaving shakily.After sending Old Mi off, Zu An retired for the night and lay down on his bed. He tried formulating a plan to obtain Yu Yanluo\u2019s dudou, but despite racking his brain to the point that a bald spot was soon going to appear on his head, he was unable to come up with anything feasible. In the end, while muttering curses at Divine Physician Ji, he gradually drifted off to sleep.The following morning, Cheng Shouping entered his room to wake him up with his breakfast in hand.Seeing the food that was brought to him, Zu An suddenly felt that Cheng Shouping wasn\u2019t so much of an eyesore anymore. It felt pretty good to have a study companion attending to his every need.After having his meal, he dragged Cheng Shouping off to Brightmoon Academy with him. Since it was an order from his father-in-law, he had no choice but to follow it. He would just have to find a chance to sneak out later on.\u201cHm? Why are we leaving the Chu Estate?\u201d\u201cThe Brightmoon Academy is located in the east of the city.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Zu An was a little perplexed as to why the Chu clan\u2019s private academy was situated so far away from the estate.However, when he found himself standing before a cluster of magnificent buildings, his mouth opened agape. The entrance was tall and imposing, and there was a plaque with the words \u2018Brightmoon Academy\u2019 hanging on top. Every single one of these words seemed to be permeated with sword ki, giving them a sharp edge.Looking from afar, there were dormitories and all sorts of different buildings, such that he couldn\u2019t see to the end of it with a single gaze. For a moment there, he thought that he had returned back to his university days in his previous life, just that this Brightmoon Academy was, without a doubt, bigger than any of the universities he knew of.\u201cIs the Chu clan\u2019s private academy this big?\u201d Zu An asked in bewilderment.\u201cWhat private academy?\u201d Cheng Shouping was confused by that remark.\u201cIsn\u2019t the Brightmoon Academy a private academy built by the Brightmoon Duke?\u201d Zu An was starting to realize that he might have misunderstood something here.\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t spout nonsense! You might bring disaster to the Master!\u201d Cheng Shouping\u2019s face paled in horror as he quickly pulled Zu An aside to explain it to him. \u201cThe Brightmoon Academy is directly under the Minister of Ceremonies, the leader of the Nine Ministers. It serves as a facility to nurture talented individuals for the royal court\u2026\u201dUnder Cheng Shouping\u2019s explanation, Zu An finally made sense of the situation. As it turned out that in this world, from the Three Lords and Nine Ministers all the way down to normal teachers and tax officials, all official positions were monopolized by the cultivators.In order to avoid the nobles from dominating official positions\u2014after all, those from distinguished backgrounds had an innate advantage when it came to nurturing cultivators\u2014the emperor had ordered for academies to be constructed all over the country, promoting the idea of education without discrimination. As such, ordinary civilians were allowed to attend the academies too.Everyone, regardless of whether one was of noble or ordinary birth, had to study in a county-level cultivator academy in order to qualify for the Three Tiered Examinations, namely the Prefectural Examination, Capital Examination, and Imperial Examination.The names were similar to what Zu An remembered from his previous world, but the subjects that were being tested were vastly different. What was tested in his previous world was the Four Books and Five Classics whereas it was cultivation in this world.Ordinary examinations would first be held in county-level academies located in major cities, such as the Brightmoon Academy.Those who performed spectacularly in the examination would be picked out and sent to Administrative Centers headed by Prefectural Generals to compete with the talents from the other counties in the same prefecture in the Prefectural Examination. Those who cleared the Prefectural Examinations would be qualified to serve as officials, but they were limited to lower-ranking positions.Thus, most people would choose to proceed to the capital to participate in the Capital Examinations. There, they would compete with the talents selected from the various prefectures to compete for the title of the \u2018Capital Scholar\u2019.Those who became Capital Scholars would then participate in the Imperial Examination personally hosted by the emperor himself. If one were to do well there, one would be able to rise through the ranks and start from a high point. On top of that, the emperor was also the strongest expert in this world. Just a pointer from him was enough to offset years of cultivation.Of course, this was the path that the most talented individuals took. The majority of the people were eliminated in the county-level ordinary examinations. They could either choose to work harder and participate next year or opt for an academic position. As most officials were cultivators, they were mostly interested in furthering their cultivation. When it came to cumbersome administrative affairs, they could hardly be bothered to handle them personally. Thus, they would hire some advisors and subordinates to deal with them.These advisors and subordinates were usually those who had failed in the county-level ordinary examinations or had no talent for cultivation at all. However, it was not a bad way out either.Clearly, Chu Zhongtian\u2019s intention of having him attend Brightmoon Academy was for him to walk down this path. Other than cultivation, the academy also imparted to the students essential knowledge on other subjects such as law, economics, and so on.\u201cYoung master, stop standing there in a daze and enter,\u201d Cheng Shouping advised him. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you at the entrance till you\u2019re released from the academy.\u201dZu An: \u201c\u2026\u201dShit. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to finish my studies in my previous life, but as soon as I came to this world, I\u2019m going to study yet again? What is this hellhole I\u2019m trapped in?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An had considered simply turning around and leaving the academy, but Cheng Shouping was eyeing him right now, and his lips were too loose to be trusted. If he were to escape right in front of Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes, it was guaranteed that everyone in the Chu clan would hear of the matter within a day\u2019s time.Currently, he had no place to go other than the Chu clan, so he could only swallow his pride.Ahh, the life of a pimp isn\u2019t easy either! I guess I\u2019ll first enter the academy and wait till there\u2019s no one around to sneak away.Zu An grabbed the school bag which Cheng Shouping had prepared for him. To think that someone as old like me will still be carrying a school bag to school. This is so awkward!With an awful look on his face, Zu An passed through the entrance and found himself standing before a serene street with lush trees growing by the sides, bringing natural shelter to the pedestrians.Zu An looked around and noticed that there were quite a few beautiful women sporting a youthful ponytail walking around the area. Their short skirts fluttered along with the light breeze, allowing one to catch glimpses of their fair thighs.Wow, the students in this world dress a lot more openly than I thought. Maybe going to school isn\u2019t that bad after all\u2026Looking further ahead, Zu An realized that there was yet another massive gate right ahead, and there was a guard stationed there to verify the identities of the students. This was likely to be the official school gate of the academy.Zu An quickly scanned his surroundings before darting off to a pathway by the side, leaving the area.You want me to go to school? Impossible! There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m going to school again!Zu An swiftly made his way through the pathway that was sheltered by trees around. However, the academy had done too well foresting the areas around the academy that there were tall trees and flowers no matter where he went. After taking a few bends, he realized that he was lost.By the time he finally left the perimeters of Brightmoon Academy, he could hardly discern where he was anymore.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d It had barely been two days since Zu An arrived in this world, and he didn\u2019t have time to familiarize himself with the huge Brightmoon City too. He couldn\u2019t recognize his surroundings, so it was hard for him to figure out where he was.\u201cGiven how famous the Yu clan is, I guess I should be able to find her residence by grabbing a passerby and asking him,\u201d Zu An muttered to himself. All that was in his mind at the moment was completing the task assigned by Ji Dengtu so that he could regain his manhood. As for cultivating and whatsoever, what was the point when he couldn\u2019t even get his manhood up?Zu An strolled around the area, but to his shock, he couldn\u2019t find a single person in the vicinity at all.Hong long!A streak of lightning flashed across the sky, and thunderous rumbling could vaguely be heard from afar. Following that, it began to drizzle lightly.The drizzle wasn\u2019t much of a concern to Zu An, but the lightning left him feeling unnerved inside. One must know that he was brought to this world by a strike of lightning, and he wasn\u2019t so naive as to believe that he could return back to his world by being struck a second time. What was more likely for him to drop dead and lose his life.Hong long!The deafening rumbles of the thunder crescendoed. Zu An quickly scanned his surroundings and spotted a gazebo not too far away, so he quickly ran over to take shelter.Once he was in the gazebo, he was surprised to discover that there was already someone else here. A woman dressed in a simple dress was sitting on a chair in the gazebo, her back leaning lazily against one of the gazebo\u2019s pillars. With a hand propping up her chin, she gazed through the rain to look into the distance.She hooked her forefinger around a green wine gourd beside her and swirled it lightly. It was such a light movement that it felt like the gourd would fall from her hands with the slightest push of the wind, but it never did.Zu An\u2019s attention was soon drawn to yet another detail. The woman\u2019s shoes were placed neatly on the ground, and her beautifully shaped feet were curled up naturally on the chair, slightly visible under the veil of her dress. It looked warmer than jade and smoother than silk.Zu An admitted that he had an obsession with the face, chest, hip, and leg. Other than that, the other parts could look like anything for all he cared. However, he was starting to understand why some people would have a feet fetish.\u201cHave you seen enough yet?\u201d The woman hadn\u2019t bothered turning around, but she knew exactly what was happening behind her.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen enough yet,\u201d Zu An replied reflexively, only to regret it right away. He really should kick his habit of running his mouth. He kept forgetting that he wasn\u2019t on the internet anymore, where he was protected by a veil of anonymity. People could literally beat him up here!While his cultivation had grown significantly yesterday, such that he possessed strength rivaling 20 men, he had an inexplicable feeling that the woman sitting before him was not someone he could deal with.Clearly, the woman also hadn\u2019t expected him to respond so vehemently. She turned around to look at the shameless man that had barged into the gazebo and assessed him. A moment later, she turned her attention back to the rain as she remarked, \u201cContinue watching then.\u201dThis time, it was Zu An\u2019s turn to be shocked. He had seen all sorts of bizarre individuals on the internet, but he didn\u2019t think that this woman would reply in such a manner. On top of that, when she turned her head over earlier, he noticed that she was an enchanting beauty. It was just that her clear yet distant eyes carried a tinge of melancholy.Just like that, she sat on the chair, leaned against the pillar, and watched the rain before her. An occasional breeze would bring droplets of rain into the gazebo and soak her, but she remained unfazed. Even amidst the pattering rain, her quiet breathing could be somehow heard.Zu An was initially still assessing her captivating profile in interest, but her air of melancholy seemed to be contagious. Slowly, he found his heart growing heavier along with the atmosphere.So, he retracted his gaze and immersed himself in the raining scenery too. It was then that he heard an unfamiliar tune that took his breath away. For a moment, he saw a waterfall flowing in reverse, returning upward; the seeds of a dandelion flower was drifting into the distance, filling the sky with many tiny umbrellas; the sun rising from the west yet setting in the east; the ten years he had spent working himself to the bone in the kitchen during his schooling years\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re crying?\u201dAn elegant voice sounded in his ears. It was only then that Zu An realized that he was tearing up. The woman sitting opposite to him stared at him curiously.\u201cI miss my home,\u201d Zu An wiped the tears off his face as he replied. He had been overwhelmed by both the excitement and horror of having transmigrated into a foreign world that he hadn\u2019t had any time to think about his home. The momentary flashback made him remember the parents he had in the other world, and he couldn\u2019t bear to imagine how anguished they were when they heard of his death.The woman\u2019s expression flickered a moment. She seemed to be surprised to hear that he was able to understand her music.It was then that Zu An noticed a seashell-like instrument in her hands. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou were blowing on that earlier?\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d the woman replied with a nod.\u201cCan you lend it to me for a moment?\u201d Zu An asked.\u201cYou know how to play music?\u201d The woman asked in surprise.Zu An smiled in self-deprecation. \u201cI\u2019m a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to useless skills that can\u2019t be used to make a living.\u201dThe woman chuckled upon hearing those words before tossing the instrument in her hand over. Zu An received the instrument before proceeding to examine it. While this seashell-like instrument had a unique appearance, the principles behind how it functioned weren\u2019t too difficult to figure out. He was just about to bring it over to his mouth to test out the notes when he noticed a light lipstick imprint on it. That made him a little hesitant, so he turned to the woman and asked, \u201cMay I?\u201dThe woman smiled and nodded her head.Zu An finally brought the instrument to his lips to test it out. In a few moments, he had already roughly figured out the notes that it could play. It bore striking resemblance to the ocarina in his previous life.His nostalgia for his home had been invoked by the previous melody, so he subconsciously played Scenery of Hometown. He had worked hard learning it during his university years for the purpose of picking up girls, only to regrettably realize that no matter how well he could play the ocarina, it was still no match for a Ferrari. As the memories of his previous life flashed across his eyes, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was all a dream. Was it Zhou Zhuang who dreamt of becoming a butterfly, or a butterfly that dreamt of becoming Zhou Zhuang?When the melody came to an end, the duo in the gazebo had already fallen into deep reminiscence, leaving just the sound of the rain between them.It was till the woman seated opposite to him wiped the corner of her eyes that Zu An remarked, \u201cYou\u2019re crying too.\u201dThe woman sighed softly and said, \u201cI saw vast fields, the setting sun, and farewells in your melody. What\u2019s the name of the tune?\u201d\u201cScenery of Hometown,\u201d Zu An replied. \u201cYours?\u201d\u201cThe Silent Sea.\u201d The woman picked up her gourd and took a sip of wine. \u201cYou want some?\u201dZu An hesitated a little. \u201cI don\u2019t have a cup.\u201d For some reason, he found that he was unable to bear any perverted thoughts toward the woman sitting before him. He didn\u2019t feel like the usual him.The woman tossed the gourd over. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I mind. What are you so restrained?\u201dSeeing how carefree the woman was, Zu An felt that he was being a little too stiff here. So, he tilted his head up and drank a huge mouthful. However, as soon as the wine flowed into his mouth, he felt a surge of heat swiftly engulfing his body, burning him up.He choked on the sensation and began coughing violently, such that his face turned a little red. \u201cWhat wine is this? It\u2019s so strong!\u201d It was even more potent than the vodka he had once drunk in his previous life.\u201cIts name is Burning Sky. It\u2019d indeed be hard for most people to bear its high alcoholic content. It\u2019s due to my special constitution that I often drink this wine to warm my body,\u201d the woman replied. She took her gourd back and had a light sip of wine. A slight blush formed on her snowy cheeks. She seemed to enjoy the alcohol a lot.\u201cMy name is Zu An. May I know your name?\u201d Zu An asked.The woman shook her head lightly and smiled. \u201cLife is a series of transient fates. If we\u2019re going to part in the end, we might as well not know one another.\u201dZu An was stifled. \u201cBut I already told you my name.\u201dThe woman replied, \u201cYou were the one who told me on your own accord. I didn\u2019t ask for it.\u201d\u201cI feel like I just got taken advantage of,\u201d Zu An grumbled in displeasure.The woman burst into laughter. \u201cYou drank my wine. No matter how I look at it, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re on the disadvantageous side.\u201d\u201cI guess so too.\u201d Zu An noticed that the rain was slowly coming to a halt, so he rose to his feet. \u201cIf fate brings us together once more, will you tell me your name?\u201d\u201cI doubt that we\u2019ll be able to meet again.\u201d The woman shook her head. She shot a glance at the school bag he was carrying, and a bizarre expression appeared on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re a student of Brightmoon Academy?\u201dZu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Just like how a truant student would never admit to his own truancy, he eyed the woman warily and replied, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to answer my question, why should I answer yours?\u201dThe woman pointed to the bag he was carrying and said, \u201cI can tell even if you don\u2019t say a thing. You\u2019re carrying a backpack that only the students of Brightmoon Academy have. It should be lesson time now; what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cFrom kindergarten all the way till university, I have already studied for more than twenty years. I don\u2019t ever want to go to school again,\u201d Zu An replied in frustration.\u201cKindergarten? University?\u201d Confusion flickered across the woman\u2019s eyes. However, she chose not to ask about it. I am also keeping many things to myself, so what rights do I have to question him?\u201cThanks for your wine, I\u2019ll be heading off first.\u201d Zu An was still thinking of looking for Yu Yanluo. Naturally, this had to take precedence over everything since it concerned his lifetime of happiness!\u201cAlright. It looks like we might just meet one another again in the near future.\u201d A playful smile formed on the woman\u2019s lips.Zu An eyed her impassively. Like I\u2019d trust you. Is it an intrinsic trait of beautiful women to use enigmatic words to hook the interest of men?But barely after Zu An walked out of the gazebo, he suddenly noticed a black-clothed man walking along the pavement. The latter shot a casual look at him before passing him by, but barely a few steps later, he quickly backtracked and called out, \u201cZu An?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Zu An looked at the black-clothed man with a frown. The latter had a long scar stretching from his nose all the way to his right cheek. There was also a plum blossom insignia near his neckline, which made his heart skip a beat. He remembered Plum Blossom Twelve bearing a similar tattoo too.[1] (It\u2019s a Japanese tune played by Sojiro)[2] (It\u2019s from a poem of a man who dreamt of becoming a butterfly before waking up, and he wondered which one was truly the dream; him being a butterfly or him dreaming of waking up as Zhou Zhuang. Similarly, he\u2019s wondering if this current life is the dream, or the previous one the dream?)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am Plum Blossom Thirteen, remember? I even went gambling with you once. Have you forgotten about me so quickly?\u201d\u201cPlum Blossom Thirteen!\u201d Zu An remembered Plum Blossom Twelve mentioning him, saying that he was the strongest amongst Mei Chaofeng\u2019s 13 godsons, having reached the third rank in his cultivation.Zu An felt a little exasperated. Why is it that all of the enemies I encounter have to be stronger than me? At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how the previous owner of his body was so talented at diving headfirst into danger. To think that he actually gambled together with people like this!\u201cWhere\u2019s Twelve?\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen asked.\u201cWhat Twelve? Why are you asking me?\u201d Zu An feigned ignorance. At the same time, he was surprised how quickly Plum Blossom Thirteen came to him.\u201cStop feigning ignorance. Someone saw you leaving the city together with him, and he\u2019s nowhere to be found ever since then!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen said with a chilling voice.\u201cAh, I remember it now! You\u2019re referring to Plum Blossom Twelve!\u201d Zu An clapped his hands together in realization. \u201cShortly after the two of us left the city, we bumped into a person who went by the surname of Tan. He immediately began chasing after that Tan guy, so we ended up parting with one another. I\u2019ve no idea what happened to him afterward.\u201d\u201cA person who went by the surname of Tan\u2026 Could it be that traitor, Tan Wei?\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen asked.Zu An said, \u201cIt seems like you have an idea of what happened. Alright, since this misunderstanding is clarified, I\u2019ll be taking my leave now.\u201d If the other party was a beautiful female assassin, he could have considered chatting a little longer. However, he wasn\u2019t interested in accompanying a fierce-looking man with a scar on his face.\u201cWait a moment!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen reached out to grab Zu An\u2019s shoulder.The force on his shoulder made Zu An realize that Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s strength far exceeded his. So, he suppressed his urge to attack him. \u201cWhat else do you need from me?\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen took out a paper from his robe. \u201cIt\u2019s about time. Shouldn\u2019t you return the debt you owe me?\u201d\u201cHuh? What debt?\u201d Zu An was dumbstruck.\u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking of shirking on your debt, are you? It\u2019s written clearly on paper, and I have your fingerprint here too!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen sneered coldly.Zu An quickly leaned forward to take a closer look. It was stated on it that he owed Plum Blossom Thirteen 1000 silver taels, and there was a red fingerprint at the bottom of the paper too. Seeing this, memories began surfacing in his mind.It appeared that he had visited a gambling den together with Plum Blossom Thirteen, but he ended up losing all of his money. Desperate to recoup his losses, he turned to Plum Blossom Thirteen to borrow his money, only to end up losing yet another 1000 silver taels.Shit! This fellow really is a useless trash. It\u2019s no wonder why everyone looks down on him so much, such that even a maid dares to lecture him to his face!Zu An was starting to look down on the previous owner of his body. His existence was really a waste of space in this world. One must know that 1000 silver taels equated to 1,800,000 RMB!\u201cYou said that you\u2019ll return my money once you get into the Chu Estate. Where\u2019s my money?\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen stretched out his hand as he demanded the repayment of the debt. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have money, I'll follow the terms of the contract and sever your hands.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the young master of the Chu clan! You dare to touch me?\u201d Zu An bucked up his courage and stood up. Even though he had earned a bit of money from Ji Xiaoxi and Plum Blossom Twelve, he wasn\u2019t even close to having 1000 silver taels under his name.Besides, even if he had the money, he wasn\u2019t willing to waste it on repaying the debt of that darned useless trash! Why should he use his hard-earned money to repay the debt owed by another man? Not to mention, he had the Chu clan behind his back now!\u201cIf you really owe him money, I advise you to honestly return his money to him. Vows and contracts hold great power in this world, and anyone who dares to violate them will suffer heavenly retribution. Even the Brightmoon Duke wouldn\u2019t be able to protect you if you go against your promise,\u201d a cold voice sounded from the gazebo.\u201cOh? There\u2019s actually such a beautiful woman hiding here?\u201d Wonderment flashed across Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s eyes upon seeing the woman in the gazebo.\u201cAre you thinking of flirting with me?\u201d The woman tilted her head slightly as she asked curiously..Plum Blossom Thirteen burst into laughter and said, \u201cSo what if I\u2026\u201d However, when his gaze finally fell on the green wine gourd she was swirling with her fingers, he suddenly remembered something and laughed awkwardly. \u201cMiss, you\u2019re misunderstanding me. Our Plum Blossom Sect is an upright sect, so there\u2019s no way I would do something like that.\u201dZu An\u2019s curiosity about the woman\u2019s identity further deepened. If even the arrogant Plum Blossom Thirteen didn\u2019t dare to provoke her, she must be quite a formidable figure indeed. He made use of this opportunity to snatch the debt note over so as to examine it closely.Plum Blossom Thirteen scoffed coldly. \u201cAre you thinking of ripping the debt note? It\u2019s no use. I have spare copies with me. It won\u2019t change a thing at all.\u201dZu An didn\u2019t pay him any heed. He quickly read through the terms, and soon, his eyes lit up. \u201cAccording to the contract, the loan period is till three days later. There\u2019s still time, so what are you in such a rush for? I\u2019ll repay your money in three days\u2019 time, so you need not worry!\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen frowned upon hearing those words. He didn\u2019t want to let Zu An off the hook so easily, but the woman in the gazebo\u2026 In the end, he eventually chose to go along with it. \u201cFine. If you can\u2019t return my money three days later, you can be certain that not even the Jade Emperor will be able to save you!\u201dHe snatched his debt note back from Zu An\u2019s hands before taking his leave. He was going to head to their sect\u2019s headquarters and inform the sect leader about what he had seen today so that the latter could take precautions accordingly.Meanwhile, Zu An shot a glance at the woman in the gazebo and asked, \u201cHe seems to be quite afraid of you?\u201dThe woman in the gazebo smiled at him. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of me; he just doesn\u2019t want to bring trouble to his sect. I must say, I am quite curious how you\u2019re going to raise 1000 silver taels within three days.\u201dZu An returned back to the gazebo and said with a mischievous smile, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to lend it to me, I can chase him and return him his money right away.\u201dThe woman was stunned for a moment before remarking deeply, \u201cYou are really thick-skinned.\u201dZu An sighed. \u201cWhat else can I do? Honest men are disadvantaged no matter which world you are in. Having thick skin goes a long way.\u201dThe woman shook her head before taking another sip of wine. \u201cI don\u2019t know you well, so why should I lend my money to you? Besides, I don\u2019t have that much money either.\u201dZu An had predicted that she would respond in this manner, and he chuckled cheekily and said, \u201cOn the account that we once shared a gourd of wine with one another, why don\u2019t you tell me what are the most lucrative sectors in the city? I\u2019ll try my luck.\u201dThe woman put down her wine gourd to assess him once more. \u201cYou\u2019re quite an interesting person. The two most lucrative sectors in Brightmoon City are salt and metal. Most people in this world are ordinary mortals; they need to eat and farm. Life in this world revolves around those two.\u201cOther than that, there\u2019s also the Yu clan\u2019s ki stones. That\u2019s a highly profitable business. Ki stones are rare and valuable, and the demand for them far surpasses the supply.\u201cOf course, most of what I\u2019ve stated is the commercial aspects of the city. If you\u2019re sufficiently strong as a cultivator, there are far more means for you to earn money.\u201dZu An rolled his eyes at the last few words and said, \u201cIf I\u2019m strong enough, I wouldn\u2019t have been threatened by those from the Plum Blossom Sect.\u201d\u201cThen it can\u2019t be helped then.\u201d The woman chuckled casually.Zu An continued asking, \u201cActually, there\u2019s a far easier, more convenient way to earn a lot of money at once.\u201d\u201cOh? What is it?\u201d The woman\u2019s interest was piqued.\u201cI once heard of a theory from a handsome guy. He said that there are countless women in this world, but our energy is limited. If we use our limited energy to flirt with every woman we come across, we\u2019re just wasting our energy for nothing. So, he decided to devote his energy to flirt with only rich women instead. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, I feel like what he said makes a lot of sense. I should learn from his example,\u201d Zu An replied seriously.\u201cWhat a refreshing way of describing a mooch. You\u2019re really one-of-a-kind in the world,\u201d the woman replied speechlessly.\u201cMiss, won\u2019t you consider me? A suave, considerate, and dashing man like me would be perfect for you.\u201d Zu An marketed himself.\u201cAren\u2019t you already the young master of the Chu clan? Yet, you still want to flirt with me?\u201d The woman spat on the floor. \u201cScumbag.\u201dZu An was stunned. \u201cYou know me?\u201d\u201cNot at the start. It\u2019s not that hard for me to guess after hearing the conversation between you and Plum Blossom Thirteen.\u201d The woman pointed out with a smile. \u201cThe news has already gotten all around town. The princess of Brightmoon City, the First Miss of the Chu clan, has just gotten married, and her spouse isn\u2019t any distinguished young master but a useless trash.\u201cTo be honest, I was quite curious why someone as outstanding as Chu Chuyan would choose a person like you as her husband. However, now that I\u2019ve met you in person, I think I can understand it now.\u201dZu An puffed out his chest and asked, \u201cBecause I\u2019m good-looking?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s because you\u2019re shameless.\u201d The woman stretched her back, displaying a beautiful arc with her body. \u201cI\u2019ve been out for a while, so I should be heading back now. If fate permits, we\u2019ll meet again.\u201dAfter saying her piece, the woman began heading toward the bamboo forest behind the gazebo.Somehow, her departing silhouette looked a little forlorn to Zu An. Despite her occasional smiles and chuckles, she gave off a sorrowful air that simply wouldn\u2019t dissipate.\u201cI wonder what\u2019s pulling down her mood.\u201d Zu An thought for a moment before suddenly freezing up. Hm? Why am I acting deep all of a sudden?Zu An quickly reined in his thoughts and headed off to look for Yu Yanluo.Meanwhile, Plum Blossom Thirteen sprinted all the way to the headquarters of the Plum Blossom Sect, located at the south of the city. He headed straight for the sect leader\u2019s study room.Bam!\u201cBad news, sect master\u2026\u201d As soon as he barged in, he heard a shriek of horror. A naked woman quickly darted to the side as she scrambled to find something to cover her body.\u201cIf you can\u2019t give me an appropriate explanation for this, you better prepare to head over to the Enforcement Hall to receive 20 whip lashes.\u201d A one-eyed man sitting before the study room grabbed the hair of the panicking woman and pressed her down beneath the table.Wuuuuu\u2026All that was left was indistinguishable mumblings from the woman.Plum Blossom Thirteen gulped down a mouthful of saliva. Tan Wei\u2019s wife sure has fair skin. However, he quickly snapped out of his thoughts and said, \u201cI just met Zu An.\u201dNeedless to say, the one-eyed man was the sect leader of the Plum Blossom Sect, Mei Chaofeng.\u201cWho is Zu An?\u201d Mei Chaofeng leaned against the chair as a hint of pleasure rippled across his face.\u201cIt\u2019s the man whom you ordered Twelve to eliminate a while ago,\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen hurriedly replied.\u201cAh, the young master of the Chu Clan?\u201d Mei Chaofeng straightened his body as a hint of rage surfaced in his eye.Cough cough\u2026 The woman beneath the table dry heaved.Mei Chaofeng shot a glance below before raising his gaze to face Plum Blossom Thirteen. \u201cTwelve messed things up the last time, so I gave him another chance to make up for his mistakes. What\u2019s wrong? Did he fail his mission again?\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen replied, \u201cI heard from our brothers in the sect that they spotted Twelve leaving the city together with Zu An. I thought that the matter would be settled with that. Yet, Zu An actually appeared in the city once more even though Twelve hasn\u2019t returned.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Mei Chaofeng frowned as he noticed that something was amiss here.Plum Blossom Thirteen replied, \u201cI asked him about it. He said that the two of them bumped into Tan Wei not too long after leaving the city. Twelve went to chase after Tan Wei, and the two of them ended up parting from one another.\u201d\u201cWuuuuu~\u201d Hearing the words \u2018Tan Wei\u2019, the woman under the table got a little agitated and struggled to rise to her feet. However, Mei Chaofeng pressed her firmly down, not allowing her to move in the least.Plum Blossom Thirteen felt dryness in his throat. \u201cGodfather, is it possible for Twelve to have been\u2026\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d Mei Chaofeng waved his hand. \u201cBe it in terms of cultivation level or wits, Tan Wei is far from a match for Twelve. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d have been able to pose a threat to Twelve.\u201d\u201cReport!\u201d A sect member suddenly arrived at the doorway of the study room at this moment. \u201cWe have found Tan Wei\u2019s corpse outside the city.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMei Chaofeng laughed heartily upon hearing the news. \u201cWhat did I tell you earlier? There\u2019s no way a mere Tan Wei could have been Twelve\u2019s match.\u201dHis arrogant laughter was mixed with muffled weeping sounds coming from beneath the table. Without any hesitation, he sent a slap over. \u201cWhat are you crying for? Now that Tan Wei is dead, you\u2019ll be following me from now on. I guarantee you that you\u2019ll have a much better life than before!\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen gulped down his saliva. I think I better marry an ugly wife in the future just to be safe. If I really want to have pretty ladies, I can just head out to find them on the streets.\u201cReport!\u201d Another flustered sect member arrived at the entrance of the study room. \u201cSect leader, we have found traces of Lord Twelve\u2019s clothes in the vicinity of the Wolf Valley. It\u2019s stained with blood.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d The agitated Mei Chaofeng rose to his feet and slammed his palm on the table.Plum Blossom Thirteen subconsciously averted his eyes. The sight before him was simply a little too jarring.Mei Chaofeng immediately pulled up his pants and walked over to the doorway. He snatched over the tattered bloodied fabric from the hands of the sect member and examined it closely. There were bits of an incomplete embroidery of the word \u2018Twelve\u2019. \u201cIt really belongs to Twelve!\u201d\u201cThe culprit must be Zu An! I\u2019ll kill him right now!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen bellowed in rage. He grabbed his dagger as he began rushing out of the room.\u201cNonsense! No matter how useless and trashy that fellow is, he\u2019s still the son-in-law of the Chu clan in name. Do you not want your life anymore, killing him in the city?\u201d Mei Chaofeng glared at Plum Blossom Thirteen coldly. \u201cBesides, how could Twelve possibly get done in by that trash?\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen regained his composure after hearing those words. No matter how little the Chu clan thought of this son-in-law of theirs, if he were to publicly kill Zu An in the city, they would still exact vengeance in order to uphold the reputation and honor of the Chu clan.And the Chu clan\u2019s vengeance wouldn\u2019t just stop at Plum Blossom Thirteen. It would likely implicate the entire Plum Blossom Sect too.That was also the reason why Plum Blossom Twelve initially duped Zu An out to the suburbs and tied him onto a tree to get him struck by lightning. It was a perfect plan, but who could have thought that Zu An would be so lucky as to survive that ordeal?All of a sudden, Plum Blossom Thirteen thought of a possibility. \u201cGodfather, could it be possible that Zu An has been feigning weak all this while? Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t make sense why the First Miss of the Chu clan would be interested in useless trash like him.\u201dMei Chaofeng waved his hand in denial. \u201cImpossible. I have insider news that that fellow is utter trash from head-to-toe. As for why the First Miss of the Chu clan chose him as her husband, there\u2019s a complicated reason behind that which can\u2019t be explained concisely.\u201d\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t the culprit, that leaves only one last possibility,\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen said deeply.\u201cWhen in the world did you catch the bad habit of halting your sentence halfway? Hurry up and spit out whatever you want to say!\u201d Mei Chaofeng hollered impatiently.Plum Blossom Thirteen hurriedly replied, \u201cI think that Zu An might have powerful experts guarding him by his side. It\u2019s too much of a coincidence for him to survive the lightning strike a few days ago and overcome Twelve\u2019s assassination this time around. There must be an expert helping him from the shadows!\u201d\u201cAn expert helping him?\u201d Mei Chaofeng frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. You should have seen that useless trash\u2019s information. There\u2019s no way he could be acquainted with any experts.\u201d\u201cBut earlier today, I saw him together with someone in the academy\u2026\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen leaned closer to Mei Chaofeng\u2019s side and told him about the woman he had encountered in the academy earlier on.\u201cYou did well. While Shang Liuyu isn\u2019t known for her cultivation, she has the academy behind her back. Furthermore, that woman is an enigmatic one, so it\u2019s best not to cross her wherever possible.\u201d Mei Chaofeng pondered for a moment before shaking his head. \u201cHowever, based on her personality, it\u2019s unlikely for her to get involved in this kind of matter.\u201d\u201cIf it isn\u2019t from the academy, could it be that the Chu clan has assigned a guard to protect him?\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of resources to protect useless trash.\u201d Mei Chaofeng harrumphed. \u201cBut what you have just said isn\u2019t entirely possible. The Chu clan might have assigned someone to protect him secretly. I\u2019ll find some time to ask the client about this. Before then, we have to make sure to proceed carefully. We need to kill him using our wits, not force.\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen smiled sinisterly as he took out a debt note. \u201cI thought that this was useless, but who could have thought that it\u2019d play a crucial role in our mission? I\u2019ve already issued him an ultimatum. If he doesn\u2019t fork out the money within three days, even the Jade Emperor won\u2019t be able to stop us from chopping away his hands!\u201dMei Chaofeng found his mood lifting in an instant. \u201cAs expected of someone whom I groomed with my own hands. You did well! The Chu clan has strict rules that forbid any of their clan members from gambling. I reckon that Chu Zhongtian wouldn\u2019t stand up for that useless son-in-law of his or a matter like this!\u201dOblivious to all of the scheming occurring behind his back, Zu An had finally arrived at the Yu clan\u2019s villa after asking a few passers-by for directions.In terms of scale and magnificence, it paled slightly in comparison to the Chu Estate. However, it had a serene and peaceful environment that the Chu Estate couldn\u2019t compete with.\u201cIs Second Old Master Jian in?\u201d Zu An approached the guards by the entrance and enquired.He had already looked into it beforehand. Yu Yanluo\u2019s husband, the Cloudmidst Duke, went by the surname of \u2018Jian\u2019. Naturally, the brother-in-law who journeyed into the valley back then to fetch Yu Yanluo also bore the \u2018Jian\u2019 surname.\u201cWho are you?\u201d The guard assessed Zu An warily.Zu An tossed a piece of silver crumb over. This was one of the loots he had obtained from Plum Blossom Twelve.The guard\u2019s expression clearly became gentler upon receiving the silver crumb, and a slight smile formed on his previously austere face. He leaned in closer and replied, \u201cThe Second Old Master is out at the moment. He isn\u2019t in the villa.\u201dZu An heaved a sigh of relief. It was clear to him that there was internal strife within the Yu clan, and the Second Old Master Jian appeared to be on bad terms with Yu Yanluo. What if his act of saving Yu Yanluo had actually foiled Second Old Master Jian\u2019s plan? If so, by visiting this place, he would be walking into the other party\u2019s trap.So, the first thing he did was to check if Second Old Master Jian was in. Upon learning that he wasn\u2019t around, he heaved a sigh of relief before continuing on, \u201cI wish to meet your Madame.\u201dThe guard was amused. \u201cThere are plenty of men in the world who wish to meet our Madame. I\u2019m afraid that this bit of money isn\u2019t enough.\u201dInstead of wasting his words on the guard, Zu An took out the jade token he had obtained from Yu Yanluo. \u201cDo you recognize this? I am a friend of your Madame. Relay my presence to her, and I\u2019m certain that she\u2019ll meet me.\u201dSeeing the huge \u2018Yu\u2019 word inscribed on the jade token, the pupils of the guard dilated in astonishment. \u201cMy apologies for failing to recognize an esteemed guest! Milord, how should I address you?\u201dZu An replied impatiently, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with unimportant matters. Hurry up and report my presence!\u201d It went without saying that he wouldn\u2019t be so foolish as to leave behind any information for Second Old Master Jian to look into his identity.\u201cUnfortunately, our Madame has gone to the neighboring commandery to handle some affairs,\u201d the guard replied bitterly.Zu An was stunned. \u201cWhen will she return?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll take at least ten days to half a month,\u201d the guard replied.With a \u2018What a waste of my time\u2019 look on his face, Zu An turned around and left the area. He felt a little vexed to hear that Yu Yanluo was actually not around. Could it be that she was hiding from him so as to avoid paying the compensation?As Zu An walked away, he suddenly realized something. He quickly returned to the entrance of the villa and stretched his hand out demandingly. \u201cReturn me my silver crumb!\u201dThe guard looked as if he had eaten a fly. How can there be such a stingy person in the world? To actually take back the money you have already given out! Had it been anyone else, the guard would have surely paid him no heed. However, this man was likely to be their Madame\u2019s friend, so he didn\u2019t dare to offend him.He could only unwillingly give the silver crumb back.You have successfully trolled a guard for +66 Rage!So few Rage points\u2026 It\u2019s no wonder why you don\u2019t even deserve to have a name! One must know that Zu An was someone who had once collected over 20,000 Rage points. He felt that it was almost beneath him to collect such pocket change.After leaving the Yu clan, Zu An spent some time strolling around Brightmoon City to familiarize himself with the surroundings. Good decisions could only be made with a good understanding of the context, and he knew that his knowledge of his surroundings was too limited.He spent half a day observing his surroundings carefully while walking through the streets and the alleys. Through his effort, he managed to gain a rough understanding of the layout of Brightmoon City and the locations of some major facilities. At the very least, he wasn\u2019t utterly ignorant anymore.The sky soon darkened. Zu An thought that it was about time, so he returned back to the Chu Estate.He asked the servants and found out that Chu Chuyan wasn\u2019t back yet. From the looks of it, it didn\u2019t seem like she would be returning anytime soon. This left him feeling a little distressed.He was initially planning on borrowing some money from her to tide through this crisis. After all, she was quite forthright in lending him 300 silver taels back at the ancestral hall.Don\u2019t I feel embarrassed asking money from a woman, you might ask? Impossible! A ladymooch should have some self-awareness of his own position. Since I received so much scorn and disdain by becoming the drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan, it\u2019s only natural that I should enjoy the privileges that come with it!In truth, when Zu An watched the National Geographic Channel in his previous life, he was really envious of those male lions on the grasslands of the African Continent. Other than fighting one another from time to time, they barely needed to do anything at all. They could count on the huge harem of lionesses behind them to hunt for them while they idled in their den.Alright, I\u2019ve made up my mind. I can\u2019t just be content with mooching off the Chu clan; I need to be more ambitious than that. I shall become the Moochlord of this world!However, when Zu An thought about that disappointing little brother of his below, tears of bitterness began flowing from his cheeks.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d an old voice suddenly sounded from behind.Zu An jolted in shock. He turned around and saw Old Mi standing by the doorway. \u201cAre you a ghost? Do you not make a sound when you walk?\u201dOld Mi ignored Zu An\u2019s questions and, instead, posed one of his own, \u201cYou just returned from the academy?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Zu An replied. I\u2019m not really lying anyway. I did go to the academy earlier in the day; it\u2019s just that I left right away.\u201cDid you meet Wei Hongde?\u201d The hunched over Old Mi looked at Zu An as he patiently waited for a response.Zu An replied, \u201cIt was my first time there today. I couldn\u2019t find him.\u201dOld Mi nodded in response before reminding him, \u201cYou need to hurry up.\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201d Zu An felt a little embarrassed about this matter. He reminded himself to look into that fellow so that he could at least be accountable to Old Mi for this.\u201cAlright. You should take a rest,\u201d Old Mi said before he turned around and left the room.It was then that a fiery red figure suddenly rushed in like a fire spirit. \u201cOi, Zu An! Why didn\u2019t I see you in the academy today?\u201dNeedless to say, it was the Second Miss of the Chu clan, Chu Huanzhao.Hearing those words, Old Mi immediately turned around to eye Zu An intently.\u201cWhere did your manners go? You should be calling me brother-in-law instead!\u201d Zu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but he put on his bravado and glared back at Chu Huanzhao.You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +24 Rage!Chu Huanzhao was going to blow her top, but she suddenly remembered the bet they had with one another that night. In the end, she could only reluctantly obey him. \u201cB-brother-in-law, why didn\u2019t I see you in the academy today?\u201dNoticing the look Old Mi was shooting at him, Zu An laughed sheepishly. \u201cThe academy is that big. It\u2019s only normal that you aren\u2019t able to find me.\u201dChu Huanzhao shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not right. I searched all of the first grade classes, but I couldn\u2019t find you. You can\u2019t possibly have been assigned to the higher grades when you have just joined the academy, right?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Mi Lianying for +99 Rage!From the sharp glare that Old Mi was directing toward him, It was clear that he had already figured out the truth. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but worry that he was going to get beaten up very soon. At this tense moment, yet another figure barged into the room.\u201cDamn you, Zu An! We were kind enough to send you to the academy so that you can get yourself educated, but you actually dared to play truant!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was no other than the matriarch of the Chu clan, Qin Wanru! As soon as she stepped into the room, she directed eyes blazing with fury toward Zu An.You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +478 Rage!Zu An\u2019s heart nearly leaped out of his chest from fright. How did she know that I played truant so quickly? But when he noticed Cheng Shouping hiding meekly behind her, he suddenly felt his blood gushing into his head out of anger.This dog bastard! He sure knows how to tell on others!\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the academy.\u201d Faced with Qin Wanru\u2019s killer glare, Zu An could only buck up his courage and speak up for himself. If he wanted any rights in the Chu clan, he would have to make sure to fight for it\u2026 even if it was an impossible battle.\u201cThis is not up to you to decide!\u201d Qin Wanru bellowed with an utterly chilling face. \u201cYou better be there tomorrow. I\u2019ll send someone to watch you by your side. If you dare to pull anything again, don\u2019t blame me for getting nasty!\u201dWith a cold harrumph, Qin Wanru turned around and stomped out of the room. Maybe it was because she felt too infuriated to let things rest so easily, she turned back after a few steps and ordered, \u201cGo to the Reflection Room and copy our Chu clan\u2019s family rules a hundred times. I\u2019ll check on it, so you better make sure that you don\u2019t miss out on even a single word!\u201d\u201cFamily rules?\u201d Zu An\u2019s face immediately darkened. He never thought that the usual scene he saw in historical dramas in his previous life would actually happen to him too!Meanwhile, Cheng Shouping giggled secretly by the back, rejoicing over Zu An\u2019s bad luck. However, Qin Wanru caught sight of his actions and harrumphed coldly. \u201cYou have failed in your duties by allowing your master to play truant, yet you don\u2019t seem to be reflecting on your actions at all. Since that\u2019s the case, I shall have you copy the family rules together with him!\u201dCheng Shouping: \u201c???\u201dHe felt wrongfully implicated in this matter. He was supposed to be just an onlooker here!Chu Huanzhao stuck out his tongue at Zu An before running over to her mother\u2019s side. She pulled her mother\u2019s arm and said, \u201cMother, I reckon that my brother-in-law is just having difficulties trying to adapt to the academy. Give it a few days, and he\u2019ll do better by then.\u201d\u201cWhat did you call him?\u201d Qin Wanru\u2019s frown emerged once more.\u201cB-brother-in-law\u2026\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face reddened. She was embarrassed because it was unseemly for her to have lost a bet against Zu An.\u201cHow can this useless fellow be worthy of being your brother-in-law? You aren\u2019t to call him like that anymore, got it?\u201d Qin Wanru glared at her daughter. She was already very frustrated right now, but her daughter was only vexing her more.\u201cOrh~\u201d Chu Huanzhao pulled a face at Zu An, as if saying that it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the bet they made. It was her mother\u2019s edict that she had no choice but to go against that bet.Qin Wanru pulled her daughter out of the room together with her. \u201cCome with me. Make sure not to hang out with people like that in the future. You\u2019ll only be led astray.\u201dWatching the departing Madame Chu, Zu An simply couldn\u2019t understand why that tigress allowed Chu Chuyan to bring him into the Chu clan when she was so displeased with him. Judging by her ferocity, it was no wonder why Chu Zhongtian had never taken in any concubines over the years. He was starting to feel sympathy for his father-in-law for having to spend his life with a tigress.At the same time, he wondered if Ji Dengtu had a masochistic streak in him. Just what in the world was he thinking to actually be interested in such a woman?It was then that Old Mi\u2019s voice snapped him out of his thoughts. \u201cIf you continue playing truant tomorrow, I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d After saying his piece, he left the room too.Those words really gave Zu An the fright of his tone. Old Mi\u2019s tone was so livid that he had no difficulty believing that Old Mi would really carry out his words.Once everyone was gone, Cheng Shouping immediately began hollering, \u201cThat old man must be out of his mind! How dare a mere gardener threaten our young master? Young master, you need not worry. I\u2019ll report this matter to the Madame right away and have her teach Old Mi a lesson right away!\u201dJust as Cheng Shouping was about to make his escape, Zu An grabbed him by his collar and dragged him back into the room. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re quite accustomed to making little reports to my mother-in-law, huh?\u201dCheng Shouping immediately kneeled down and hugged Zu An\u2019s thighs. \u201cYoung master, I was wronged! It was because I didn\u2019t see you coming out of the academy even after everyone else has been released, so I feared that you were in danger. Thus, I ran all the way back to the Chu Estate to inform Madame so that she could rescue you. My loyalty for you is like the unceasing flow of a river; the stars and the moon above can vouch for that!\u201dZu An sneered coldly. \u201cSo, I should be thanking you for this, huh?\u201dCheng Shouping immediately put on a fawning smile and said, \u201cHow can this humble one is worthy of young master\u2019s gratitude? I\u2019ll be satisfied as long as you\u2019re willing to quell your anger.\u201cGiven your bootlicking skills, you shouldn\u2019t have ended up in such a pitiful plight. Did you do something to offend my mother-in-law?\u201d Zu An remembered how Madame Chu ordered Cheng Shouping to copy the family rules as well before leaving, and he couldn\u2019t help but think that there was something deeper to it.\u201cOf course not! How could this humble one dare to offend the Madame?\u201d Cheng Shouping shook his head vehemently. \u201cBack then, when I heard the Madame telling the Master that she was going to bring in some concubines for him, I immediately went around to find suitable women for the Madame to pick from. Given my loyalty, how could I possibly offend her?\u201dZu An finally realized what was going on. Qin Wanru was just saying for the sake of it, but you actually brought women back for her to pick from. You should be glad that she didn\u2019t have her servants beat you to death on the spot!\u201cYoung master, let\u2019s hurry to the Reflection Room to copy the family rules, Otherwise, the Madame is going to punish us for disobeying her orders again,\u201d Cheng Shouping said bitterly.\u201cWhat are you in such a hurry for? It\u2019s just a mere family rules. How long could it possibly take?\u201d Zu An remembered his younger days, where his teacher punished him by having him copy down the classroom rules. How difficult could it be to copy a couple of rules? With his hand speed, it was a walk in the park!If I have a computer here with me, I can easily copy it a thousand times even\u2026 Oh, wait a moment, there isn\u2019t any difference between copying it once and a thousand times on the computer. I nearly forgot about Ctrl-C Ctrl-V.I wonder if my keyboard will have similar functions in the future too.While Zu An thought little of the punishment, he eventually caved in to Cheng Shouping\u2019s incessant pleading. With a deep sigh, he began making his way toward the Reflection Room. After all, since Madame Chu was punishing him here, the least he could do was to appear repentant.The Reflection Room was a place to punish members of the Chu clan who had erred. It was a bit similar to those isolation cells in the prisons in his previous life, just that the environment was much better than that.\u201cThis room doesn\u2019t look as bad as I thought,\u201d Zu An murmured.\u201cYoung master, let\u2019s quickly get to work. Otherwise, we won\u2019t be getting any sleep tonight,\u201d Cheng Shouping said tearfully.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just copying a hundred times? What\u2019s so hard about that?\u201d Zu An rolled his eyes. This fellow really is a countryside bumpkin. One must know that in his previous world, there were even books that had reached a word count of 10 million!\u201cWhere are the family rules?\u201d Zu An looked through the bookshelves, but he couldn\u2019t find anything related to that.\u201cIt\u2019s all there.\u201d Cheng Shouping pointed to the wall. Looking at how leisurely he looks, he must be unaware of how huge a punishment this is.Zu An turned his head over to take a look. \u201cHoly shit!\u201dThere was a huge stone tablet placed right in front of the wall, and it extended from the ceiling to the ground. There were many small words inscribed on the stone tablet. Even with a quick estimate, there had to be at least several thousand words there.The hell! What does the Chu clan need so many family rules for? Aren\u2019t they just trying to make things difficult for the later generations?With a face that was on the verge of tears, Cheng Shouping passed paper and brush over to Zu An as he said. \u201cYoung master, let\u2019s start now.\u201dZu An\u2019s eyes flickered around contemplatively before he finally turned to face Cheng Shouping. \u201cLittle Pingping, you said that you were loyal to me earlier?\u201dCheng Shouping immediately puffed out his chest and said, \u201cOf course! My loyalty to young master is unwavering, nothing can\u2026\u201dZu An interjected right in, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it out loud. You can prove your loyalty to me through your actions instead.\u201dHe pushed the paper and brush back toward Cheng Shouping before patting his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be counting on you.\u201dCheng Shouping: \u201c???\u201dLooking at the stone tablet that was completely filled with words, Cheng Shouping was utterly horrified. \u201cYoung master, this won\u2019t do. I can\u2019t possibly copy all of it by myself!\u201d\u201cA man should never say that he can\u2019t do it,\u201d Zu An encouraged him. \u201cTrust me, you definitely can do it.\u201dFaced with the tearful Cheng Shouping, Zu An knew that he had to find something better in order to motivate him. He quickly racked his mind and an idea came to his mind. \u201cAs long as you copy the family rules in my stead, I\u2019ll create an opportunity for you to interact with Snow alone in the future.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes lit up.Zu An nodded in response. \u201cOf course! Just think about it. There are times when I would need some privacy together with my wife, so naturally, you\u2019ll be left alone with Snow.\u201dThe moved Cheng Shouping sniffed up his snot as he grabbed Zu An\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYoung master, you are really the best to me!\u201dThe disgusted Zu An retracted his hand from Cheng Shouping\u2019s grasp and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not get touchy here. Alright, do your best then! I\u2019ll head out for a walk.\u201dSpeaking of Snow, Zu An suddenly remembered that Chu Chuyan was out at the moment. It was likely that Snow wouldn\u2019t be around too since she was Chu Chuyan\u2019s personal maidservant, thus making it a good opportunity for him to search her room. Perhaps, he could find some clues as to who the culprit out for his life was.Even though there were a lot of people who looked down on him in the Chu Estate, he was still the young master of the Chu clan. No one would dare to block his way.Soon, he arrived in the courtyard where Chu Chuyan\u2019s residence was located. It was fortunate that she appreciated a quiet environment, so the only one waiting on her was Snow. This made it much easier for him to sneak into her room.He walked up to the door and tried to push it open, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. Just as he had expected, the room was locked.\u201cWho is she guarding against?\u201d Zu An muttered. However, this bit of obstacle couldn\u2019t possibly stop him.He scanned the surroundings to verify that there was no one around before taking out a black cloth to conceal his face. He couldn\u2019t afford to be caught sneaking into his wife\u2019s room\u2014that would be too embarrassing!He first circled around the residence before stopping before one of the windows facing a remote location. He took out a dagger, slipped it through the cracks of the window, and pushed the latch open.\u201cHeh, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure this out.\u201d Zu An recalled all of the nifty tricks he had seen in the historical dramas from his previous life and smiled gleefully to himself.He pushed the window open and leaped in. He immediately found himself surrounded amidst the intoxicating fragrance of his wife, and it smelled rather pleasant. It was just a pity that he couldn\u2019t touch her.He had been here once before, so he was familiar with the surroundings. He quickly took a look around the study room, but there was nothing worthy of note there. So, he swiftly moved on to her bedroom.He started off by searching around the bed. There were usually some secret knobs that opened a secret compartment in the bed, or at least that was the case in the dramas he watched.In the end, he didn\u2019t find any secret compartments, but he did uncover a book hiding beneath the pillow. The title of the book was [Sweet Pampered Wife: Dominating Sword Immortal\u2019s Ninety-Nine Days of Searching For Love].Zu An: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe remembered seeing Chu Chuyan secretly reading the book back in the carriage. Out of curiosity, he picked it up to take a look, and its contents were strikingly similar to those female romance web novels in his previous life.While flipping through the book, he noticed that on one of the pages, there was a note written in elegant handwriting, \u2018Love arises from nowhere, and it grows deeper and deeper\u2026\u2019Zu An\u2019s lower jaw was on the verge of dropping down. He didn\u2019t expect that cold-faced wife to actually have such a\u2026 such a youthful side to her.\u201cTsk tsk tsk~\u201d Zu An quickly put the book back into the same position according to how he remembered it before heaving a sigh of relief. If that woman were to know that he had looked through this, she would surely skin him alive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He went over to open one of them, and he found that they were filled with beautiful dresses. Each of these dresses was made with incredibly smooth and comfortable material, and the embroidery was delicate too.He moved on to open the second drawer\u2014dresses. The third drawer\u2014still dresses\u2026All of the eight drawers were filled with all sorts of beautiful clothes, leaving Zu An slack-jawed. Women sure have a lot of clothes.There was finally something different in the ninth drawer, but the contents of which made Zu An\u2019s face redden. As it turned out, they were all undergarments placed neatly in a stack.Zu An sneakily scanned his surroundings before taking one out and stuffing it into his chest. \u201cShe has so many of it anyway. She probably won\u2019t notice it even if one of them goes missing.\u201dJust to clarify, even Zu An looked down on himself a little for doing this.He had such a beautiful wife but he was unable to touch him, and in the end, he could only resort to stealing her undergarments. To make things worse, after grabbing the undergarment, he realized that he couldn\u2019t use them given the current condition of his body!\u201cDamn it!\u201d Zu An complained as he prepared to put the undergarment back into the drawer. However, a thought suddenly came into his mind then. Wait a moment, can\u2019t I just pass this over to Ji Dengtu to complete my task? I reckon that he won\u2019t be able to tell whose it is anyway!But again, he felt a little uncomfortable since this was his wife\u2019s undergarment, even if the two of them were only related in name. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out just what that perverted middle-aged man was going to do with it.\u201cForget it! I\u2019ll just randomly buy a new set of undergarments from a shop and give it to him,\u201d Zu An murmured to himself. But then, he immediately realized that none of those four women whom Ji Dengtu mentioned were ordinary people. If he were to buy a low-quality one off the streets, he would surely be able to see through his lie right away.\u201cI\u2019ll just use Snow\u2019s one then!\u201d Zu An recalled how Snow, despite being a maidservant, was fairly well-dressed. In fact, if no one were to say it aloud, most people would probably mistake her as a young miss of a distinguished clan.That lass tried to kill me anyway. I don\u2019t feel any guilt using her clothes to accomplish my task.Having made up his mind, Zu An immediately began searching through the adjacent Snow\u2019s room. Snow\u2019s room was extremely clean. It was still possible to find romance novels hidden in Chu Chuyan\u2019s room, but when it came to Snow\u2019s, other than a couple of melon seeds lying here and there, there was nothing that hinted at her interests or preferences.\u201cIs that lass really that innocent, or is she simply that good at concealing her true nature?\u201d Zu An wondered. He was planning to use her personal possessions to deduce some information on her, but he found himself not knowing where to start.All of a sudden, he caught sight of a slight noise coming from outside, and he leaped in fright.Could it be that Chu Chuyan has decided to return in advance? This won\u2019t do. I can\u2019t let her find out that I have snuck in here, especially not with the incriminating evidence on me. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to wash my reputation clean even if I were to leap into the Yellow River!So, Zu An immediately hid behind the screens behind and held his breath. Through the slight crack between the screens, he was able to catch a slight glimpse of the view in the room.A black-clothed figure snuck in and began searching around Chu Chuyan\u2019s room.\u201cA woman?\u201d Even though the black-clothed figure had concealed her face, her alluring figure and relatively smaller physique made it highly likely that she wasn\u2019t a man.Or rather, there was no way she could have been a man. It was impossible for any man to train his pectoral muscles to such a massive size.This woman took her time searching the room, but she was unable to find anything worthy of note. She stood in the middle of the room and muttered to herself, \u201cIt isn\u2019t here either? Where could she be hiding it then?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Zu An was alarmed. The woman\u2019s voice was astonishingly familiar to him. It was the close friend of Chu Chuyan whom he had met back at the ancestral hall\u2014Pei Mianman.\u201cWho is it!\u201d The woman immediately turned her head in his direction.Zu An was a little flustered. The momentary fluctuation in his emotions earlier had caused his heartbeat to hasten a little, which caught the woman\u2019s attention.Before he could make his escape, the screens were already shredded into pieces, and the woman was rushing right toward him with a palm strike.Had it been on any other day, Zu An would surely compliment her fair and smooth hand, but there was no way he was in the mood to do so right now. Goosebumps had risen all over his body, and every single cell in him was telling him that he was in great danger.He hurled a punch over in an attempt to fend against the attack, but as soon their hands connected, he was immediately sent flying back with a spurt of blood.One must know that he currently possessed the strength equivalent to 20 adult men after his recent breakthrough, but the might commanded in the woman\u2019s fair hand far surpassed his.Sensing the other party\u2019s killing intent, Zu An couldn\u2019t care anymore. He began shouting out loud, \u201cSave\u2026\u201dSince the other party had snuck into Chu Chuyan\u2019s room in the middle of the night dressed completely in black, it went without saying that she was trying to avoid detection. Surely there should be plenty of experts in the duke\u2019s estate who could deal with her as long as he caught their attention!But before Zu An could speak out loud, the other party had already flitted right up to him once more. She struck his chest with a seemingly light palm strike that made him feel as if he was knocked down by a train, causing his voice to suddenly stop short.Watching as Zu An\u2019s body slumped to the ground weakly under her strike, the woman sneered coldly. A mere second rank cultivator actually dares to exchange blows with me.Knowing that it was impossible for him to live, she squatted down in front of him and tried to peel off his mask, wanting to know his identity.It was then that Zu An\u2019s eyes suddenly shot open. While the woman was caught off guard, he immediately wrapped himself around her body and employed the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu rear naked choke he had seen on the internet in his previous life.It went without saying that a truly qualified keyboard warrior needed to have basic knowledge in all fields in order to make his words sound logical. It was just that he lacked the physical capability to pull off whatever he knew in theory into practice. However, now that he was stronger than ever, he was confident that he could employ those techniques even more smoothly than those UFC gold belters!He knew very well that this woman\u2019s cultivation was far higher than his, and her movements earlier were faster than what he could follow. If she were to fight carefully, he wouldn\u2019t stand a chance at all. His only chance at victory was to do his best to turn it into a physical brawl. By exploiting the physical differences between a man and a woman, he might just be able to make a comeback here.To be honest, the previous strike from that woman could have very well taken his life had he not decisively taken out the Heiress Ball of Delights in time. He was hoping that the item, as depicted in the description, would keep his health bar hanging even if it was already down to the last drop.It was also with this item that he dared to buck up his courage and fight back.On the other hand, the woman didn\u2019t expect such a change in the situation. She used her elbow to strike his body again and again, hoping that he would loosen his grip. Yet, the latter wasn\u2019t budging at all.The other party had wrapped his body around her tightly. Her legs were intertwined and spread open by his, and her breasts were being molded into all sorts of shapes under the pressure of his elbows.She had never been taken advantage by a man all her life, let alone being placed in such a humiliating position. There was no way she could possibly take this lying!You have successfully trolled Pei Mianman for +999 Rage!So, she decided not to hold back anymore and use her killing moves on him.To her dismay, however, the other party was using an extremely bizarre position to pin her down, making it difficult for her to land any effective blows on him. She tried using her flexible body to escape from the other party\u2019s grip.At this point in time, she was already exploding with rage. She swore to herself that if she could break free of this fellow\u2019s grip, she would definitely grind every last bit of his bone into dust!You have successfully trolled Pei Mianman for +999 Rage!Meanwhile, Zu An couldn\u2019t be bothered to check his Rage points anymore. He was completely focused on holding the woman down. He knew that it would be disastrous for him if she were to break free of his grip.For some reason, he felt like his strength had grown considerably greater than before. From their earlier clashes, it was apparent that the woman was much stronger than him. Given so, it should have been very difficult for him to hold her down in place. Yet, even though he was in a difficult position, he was still successfully locking her down with the rear naked choke.Pei Mianman herself had also noticed the anomaly too. No matter how she struggled and fought back, the other party simply wouldn\u2019t let her go. In fact, it felt like his grip was growing stronger with each blow she landed on him.As it turned out, Old Mi had neglected to inform Zu An that the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, other than the practitioner being able to raise his cultivation level by getting beaten up, had the mystical effect of increasing the stats of the practitioner proportionate to the severity of his injuries. The closer the practitioner was to death, the greater his fighting prowess would be.Of course, under normal circumstances, a human would grow weaker along with his injuries, resulting in a drastic reduction in his stats. On top of that, being on the verge of death was an extremely dangerous condition to be in. It would take just one more strike to be K.O-ed. For that reason, the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra\u2019s enhancement in strength wasn\u2019t as powerful as it sounded in theory.However, Zu An had the Heiress Ball of Delight that allowed him to remain in a near-death state without facing the risk of dying while negating the adverse effects brought about by his injuries. This combination, in turn, maximized the potential of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra\u2019s effects.Just like that, the two of them rolled all around the ground entangled with one another. Over time, Zu An eventually managed to gain the upper hand and turn the tables around on the woman. He pinned her firmly to the ground, rendering her utterly incapable of moving.Due to her neck being choked tightly, Pei Mianman found her breathing becoming more and more arduous. She tried her best to claw at his hand, but it was to no avail. It was as if she was fighting with a monster who knew not of death and pain.She could sense death coming for her. Unwilling to let things end like that, a vicious glint flashed across her eyes as a spark of black flame formed inconspicuously on the tip of her finger.She dared not to use her elemental ability out of fear that the fluctuations in the elements would alarm the experts of the Chu clan. Once her identity was revealed, all of the hard work she had put in during this period of time would have gone to waste.But in the face of imminent death, she couldn\u2019t care less anymore.Just as she was about to make her move, a man\u2019s voice sounded in her ears, \u201cPei Mianman, I think we can cooperate with one another.\u201dIn truth, Zu An could have summoned the Poisonous Prick and easily ended her life. However, for some reason, when he thought about her ravishing figure back at the ancestral hall, her soul-stealing peach blossom eyes, as well as the unfathomable smile lingering on her beautiful face, he found himself reluctant to make a move.It was no wonder why they said that the world was biased to the good-looking.Zu An viewed himself as a simple man true to his desires, and he didn\u2019t think that there was anything bad about that.Pei Mianman was shocked to hear those words. The other party actually saw through her identity! On top of that, she found the voice oddly familiar too. \u201cWho in the world are you?\u201dShe sensed the other party loosening his grip on her neck. After a moment of hesitation, she dispelled the black flame she had summoned too.\u201cYou nearly caused my death in the ancestral hall earlier this morning. Have you forgotten about me so quickly?\u201d Zu An harrumphed.Pei Mianman widened her eyes in realization. \u201cAh, you\u2019re Chu Chuyan\u2019s useless husband, that\u2026 Ah. What\u2019s your name again?\u201dZu An: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the end, this woman had never really taken him seriously before! Clearly, as the trash son-in-law of the Chu clan, she didn\u2019t think that his name was worthy enough to be remembered. She only knew him as the \u2018useless husband of my close friend\u2019.But again, that was only to be expected. The gap between the two of them was like the clouds in the sky and the dirt on the ground. It was understandable why she wouldn\u2019t be bothered to remember his name.\u201cMy name is Zu An. Get it deep inside your head!\u201d Zu An snapped angrily. Just because it was understandable didn\u2019t mean that he wasn\u2019t going to get angry over it! To think that he thought his dashing appearance and eloquent speech had left this beautiful woman with a lasting impression of him!\u201cYes yes, I remember it now,\u201d Pei Mianman replied with gritted teeth. After the intense physical brawl they had, it was hard for her not to remember his name. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the question I should be asking you?\u201d Zu An harrumphed in response.Pei Mianman\u2019s complexion darkened. \u201cYou said that we can cooperate with one another. I would like to hear what thoughts you have in mind.\u201d She flicked her finger lightly, and a spark of flame began dancing on her fingertip.\u201cYou are here to find something, right?\u201d Zu An asked.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Pei Mianman knew that he must have seen her earlier actions, so it would be meaningless to deny it now.\u201cJudging from your look, I\u2019d say that you haven\u2019t found what you\u2019re looking for yet. I can help you,\u201d Zu An said.Had Zu An said this in the past, she would have only laughed her head off, thinking very little of his offer. However, he actually managed to curb her in the physical brawl earlier. Given so, it would be foolish to continue viewing him lightly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dZu An replied, \u201cSince you\u2019re Chu Chuyan\u2019s close friend, you should know of my awkward position in the Chu clan. The two of us are only a couple in name. So, I want you to help me become the Chu clan\u2019s real son-in-law. In return, I\u2019ll help you find what you need.\u201dPei Mianman was taken aback for a moment before she burst into laughter. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would be eyeing her. But again, Chu Chuyan is indeed a gorgeous beauty. Even a woman like me is moved by her charms. Very well, it\u2019s a deal then!\u201d\u201cYou agreed to it so easily?\u201d Zu An was a little surprised by how candid her acceptance was, such that he began doubting her sincerity.\u201cAre you worried that I\u2019d renege on this agreement once you release me?\u201d Pei Mianman scoffed coldly. She raised her hand up before him. \u201cIf not for the fact that your offer has moved me, you would have been reduced to ashes by now.\u201dIt was only then that Zu An noticed the black flames lingering on her fingertip, and he jolted in shock. This woman was actually a fifth rank expert! It was no wonder why he almost lost his life to her!Pei Mianman exclaimed coldly, \u201cIt must have been very exhilarating for you to take advantage of your wife\u2019s close friend, right? Hurry up and let go!\u201dSeeing how her finger was about to prod him, Zu An hurriedly released her before backing to the corner.Pei Mianman quickly tidied up her messy clothes. She noticed that she was cloaked in layers of dusted fingerprints. Just thinking about the physical contact they had with one another turned her face chilly, and she wondered if she should just kill this man here.Noticing the menacing look on her face, Zu An quickly changed the topic, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201dPei Mianman hesitated for a moment before replying, \u2018An accounting book.\u201d\u201cWhat accounting book? Zu An was a little surprised. He didn\u2019t think that she would go through so much effort just for a mere accounting book.However, instead of answering his question, she chuckled softly and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you more once you gain some standing in the Chu clan.\u201d Her first thought was to not honor the alliance between them. However, thinking about how she had infiltrated the Chu clan twice thus far but hadn\u2019t found any clues to the accounting book yet, she felt that having this man as an insider wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.But of course, the prerequisite was that this man had to be qualified to participate in her plans first.Pei Mianman suddenly recalled something, and she looked at him with eyes narrowed with doubt. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me what you\u2019re doing here in the middle of the night.\u201dZu An laughed awkwardly. \u201cWould you believe me if I tell you that I\u2019m here for a stroll?\u201dPei Mianman rolled her eyes. It was then that she suddenly noticed a silk cloth peeking out from Zu An\u2019s chest. \u201cHm? What\u2019s this?\u201dZu An tried to stop her, but she was too fast that the item he was hiding was snatched away in an instant.Pei Mianman looked at the female undergarment in her hand and began trembling uncontrollably in laughter. \u201cYou snuck here in the middle of the night just to steal your wife\u2019s undergarment? I have never felt more disdain for anyone in my entire life.\u201dZu An felt his face heating up. He quickly rushed forward to snatch the undergarment back into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business!\u201dPei Mianman looked at him with an increasingly bizarre gaze. \u201cAs expected of the man who climbed into his sister-in-law\u2019s bed on his wedding night. I thought that you wouldn\u2019t be this brazen, but it turns out that there\u2019s no limit to your shamelessness.\u201dBased on what he was hearing right now, it would appear that Pei Mianman wasn\u2019t the one who tossed him onto Chu Huanzhao\u2019s bed. If so, who else could be the culprit?Zu An went along with Pei Mianman\u2019s remark. \u201cWell, compared to sisters-in-law, I find the close friends of my wife much more appealing.\u201dPei Mianman maintained her usual graceful smile, but a dangerously sharp glint flashed across her eyes. \u201cThere are plenty of men who have flirted with me over the years, but none of them has ended well. If you aren\u2019t afraid, you can give it a try too.\u201dZu An shook his head. \u201cForget it then. I already had a test of it earlier anyway.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Pei Mianman\u2019s face darkened.You have successfully trolled Pei Mianman for +256 Rage!\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m saying that we should quickly leave this area after the commotion we made. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be bad if we alarm the others from the Chu clan.\u201d Zu An glanced at Pei Mianman in disappointment. Despite her open and flirtatious appearance, she wasn\u2019t the type who could take a joke.\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Pei Mianman nodded in agreement. \u201cLet\u2019s end it here today. However, if I were to hear any rumors floating around in the future, you should know that I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to sever your tongue.\u201dZu An immediately covered his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the only ones who know about what transpired here are you and me.\u201dPei Mianman harrumphed coldly. \u201cYou better forget everything that happened today.\u201dFollowing that, she leaped out of the window. However, before taking her leave, she suddenly turned around. Under the moonlight, her figure looked more entrancing than ever. \u201cSpeaking of which, what kind of skill did you use earlier? Why did your strength suddenly surge?\u201dZu An was equally confused by that too. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. Perhaps it\u2019s a manifestation of my potential in the midst of a crisis.\u201d\u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to speak, so be it. Miser.\u201d Pei Mianman harrumphed before her beautiful silhouette vanished in the midst of the night.Zu An smiled bitterly to himself. He really had no idea how it happened, though it wasn\u2019t a good time for him to be brooding over this. Fearing that someone would head over after hearing the commotion, he quickly ran back to his room.Once he was in the safe confines of his room, he took out a bottle and swallowed the pill inside.He had learned from his previous lesson, and he had no intention of allowing history to repeat itself. The effects of the Heiress Ball of Delights were limited by time, and once the effects were over, the sudden onslaught of pain and frailty was so unbearable that it could really take his life.The bottle of pills he was consuming right now wasn\u2019t the Faith in Brother Spring he drew from the keyboard. Rather, it was the recovery medicine he obtained from Ji Dengtu prior to him heading off to the Wolf Valley.\u201cCould it be a scam from that fellow though?\u201d Zu An was a little worried, but considering that he was, after all, a divine physician, he shouldn\u2019t be so underhanded as to tamper with his medicine. Besides, as the father of someone as pure and kind as Ji Xiaoxi, surely he couldn\u2019t be that evil of a person?Zu An was worried that he might have raised a flag for disaster, but after swallowing the medicine, he could feel a warm surge suffusing his body, nourishing his deficiencies and wounds.Seeing this, Zu An was finally able to put his heart at ease. He had to admit that Ji Dengtu\u2019s medicine was indeed formidable. While it wasn\u2019t as incredible as Faith in Brother Spring, which could instantaneously heal a person back to his peak condition, its effectiveness appeared to be on par with it, just that the rate of recovery was a little slower.As expected of the medicine from a divine physician!It was then that the effects of the Heiress Ball of Delights began to wear off. Due to the slow recovery of the pill, Zu An began to feel aching pain all over his body.\u201cThis really is an incredible item.\u201d Paying no heed to the pain, Zu An stared at the \u2018Heiress Ball of Delights\u2019 in his hand. If not for this item, he would have lost his life earlier on.He didn\u2019t think that it was that impressive when he used it to deal with the Wailing Whip previously. After all, he had only experienced its pain immunity effect back then. This was the first time he was testing out its ridiculous death immunity effect, and it was really as overpowered as it sounded.It was no exaggeration to say that he would have already died ten times over earlier had it not been for the Heiress Ball of Delights. Just thinking about how he wasted it once on a mere bet made him feel great self-reproach. What a huge waste that was! He only had one use of it left, and who knew how long it would take before he drew an item like this again?It was also then that Zu An suddenly remembered the requirement for the activation of this item. The other party must be a woman richer than him in order for the item to take effect. With this in mind, he couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved that Yu Yanluo wasn\u2019t around today. If he had received that 10,000 gold taels from her, there would probably be very few women in the world who were richer than him. He wouldn\u2019t be able to count on it anymore.It looks like I shouldn\u2019t receive my compensation for the time being.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but feel conflicted within. Was he actually doomed to living the life of a poor?You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +3 +3 +3\u2026Zu An was stunned. Did he offend Madame Chu again somehow? She seemed to get angry far too often. Could this be the effect of hormonal imbalance caused by premature menopause?Meanwhile, in a room inside the duke\u2019s estate, Chu Zhongtian poured a cup of tea for his wife before asking, \u201cI heard that you punished Zu An to copy the family rules for a hundred times. Isn\u2019t that a bit too much?\u201dQIn Wanru harrumphed coldly. \u201cThat fellow will never become anything great if we don\u2019t push him hard! Do you know what he did today? He actually played truant! No, that\u2019s not right. I received news from the academy that he didn\u2019t even step through the gates of the academy! Isn\u2019t this ridiculous?\u201dChu Zhongtian nodded in agreement. \u201cThat fellow has indeed gone overboard. However, you need to take his circumstances into consideration too. He is a person with low self-esteem, and having to marry into our Chu clan must have placed great pressure on his shoulders. I heard that there are many people in the estate who looks down on him. If you punish him so harshly, wouldn\u2019t you just breed ill-will in him? If so, we could really face great disturbances in the family in the future.\u201dQin Wanru glared at her husband grudgingly. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! Otherwise, Chuyan wouldn\u2019t have to choose such an inept man as her husband. I can\u2019t do much for her as her mother, but the least I can do is to help her keep her husband in line. Even if Zu An has no talent for cultivation, it isn\u2019t a bad idea for him to study hard and learn management skills so that he can take on some responsibilities in the future. At the very least, people won\u2019t make our Chuyan out to be a laughingstock.\u201d\u201cWanru, does this mean that you have accepted him as Chuyan\u2019s husband?\u201d Chu Zhongtian couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cPui!\u201d Qin Wanru spat out coldly. \u201cIf you had just given me your approval, I\u2019d have driven that fellow out of our clan in a heartbeat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once she has chosen a person, no matter how incapable he is, she won\u2019t change her mind anymore. Do you want her to remarry?\u201dQin Wanru also felt incredibly helpless about this matter. \u201cChuyan might have never mentioned why she chose that useless trash, but as parents, how could we possibly not know what she\u2019s thinking of? She\u2019s afraid that if we bring in someone who\u2019s too strong-willed and capable, he might seek to covet the businesses of our Chu clan. If so, that would put her in a spot between us and her husband. She\u2019s doing it for us. As her mother, it\u2019s also my duty to think on her behalf. At the very least, I should groom Zu An to be a decent human being.\u201dChu Zhongtian nodded in realization. \u201cAh, so that\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re so strict on him.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Qin Wanru rolled her eyes. \u201cWhy else would I order him to copy our family rules? Do you think that just anyone is worthy of copying our Chu clan\u2019s family rules? I am doing this to let him know that I already think of him as a member of our Chu clan, and I\u2019m encouraging him to turn over a new leaf and work harder in the future.\u201d\u201cBut I heard that you ordered Cheng Shouping to do it together with him. Do you view him to be a member of the Chu clan too?\u201d Chu Zhongtian asked.\u201cPui! I just can\u2019t stand that skunk!\u201d Just thinking about how Cheng Shouping brought all of those wretches before her and urged to choose those that would serve as her husband\u2019s concubines with a fawning smile, she felt great wrath boiling inside her. \u201cBesides, a hundred copies is too much. If I don\u2019t get someone to help Zu An, he won\u2019t be able to finish it even if he doesn\u2019t rest for the night.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think that my wife would be so considerate!\u201d Chu Zhongtian burst into laughter. After he calmed down a little, he hesitated for a brief moment before adding on, \u201cHowever, Zu An doesn\u2019t seem to be a bright child. Given his wits, I doubt that he\u2019ll be able to appreciate the deeper intentions behind your actions.\u201dQin Wanru: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe had also realized this possibility too\u2026 No, it was definitely the case. Without an out-of-the-world level of dumbness, how could that fellow have become a renowned useless trash in the city?\u201cShould I play the good man here? I\u2019ll head over there and tip him off,\u201d Chu Zhongtian asked.Qin Wanru thought about it for a moment before nodding. \u201cBring some snacks over too so that it doesn\u2019t appear too abrupt.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Chu Zhongtian smiled. The entire world said that he had married a shrew. They laughed at him, saying that he was just a slave to his wife. However, he knew very well that his wife was a person with a sharp mouth but a soft heart. She was much better than those who put on a tender front but schemed in the shadows.He ordered his servant to prepare several boxes of desserts before making his way over to the Reflection Room. From outside, he saw a silhouette through the windows diligently copying down the family rules. He nodded in approval as he muttered to himself, \u201cAt least he\u2019s hardworking.\u201d\u201cYou must be exhausted by now. Take a short break. Your mother-in-law told me to bring some\u2026\u201d Chu Zhongtian pushed the door open and entered the room, only to have the smile on his face freeze halfway through his words. He realized that there was only one person in the room\u2014Cheng Shouping. Zu An was nowhere to be found.Cheng Shouping immediately rushed over and hugged Chu Zhongtian\u2019s thighs in agitation. With tears streaming down his face, he cried out, \u201cOld master, I knew that you wouldn\u2019t have forgotten about me! I have not wasted my years serving you diligently. To think that you would deliver food to me personally in the middle of the night. I\u2019m really touched!\u201dChu Zhongtian held back his urge to kick Cheng Shouping away as he spoke with forced composure, \u201cWhere\u2019s your young master?\u201dAs if he was reminded of a tragic event, Cheng Shouping burst out wailing as he said, \u201cYoung master came by earlier, but when he saw how many words there were in the family rules, he ordered me to copy it by myself here. Old master, my hands are already on the verge of falling off!\u201dSince Zu An wasn\u2019t here anyway, Cheng Shouping didn\u2019t hesitate to sell him off.\u201cThat scoundrel! How dare he!\u201d Even the usually kind and patient Chu Zhongtian was infuriated by Zu An\u2019s audacity, especially when he remembered how much thought his wife had put into this. How could that brat snub his wife\u2019s goodwill? The more he thought about it, the more he couldn\u2019t stand it.So, he immediately stomped off to settle the score with Zu An. However, barely after taking a few steps, he turned around and looked at Cheng Shouping, who was following him for some reason, with a frown. \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll bring you to young master\u2019s side!\u201d Cheng Shouping was almost impressed by his own wits. To think that he managed to find such a perfect excuse on the spot. Not only would he be able to avoid the punishment, but he could also earn some brownie points with the old master too. Even he was impressed by his own intelligence!Chu Zhongtian harrumphed coldly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, I\u2019ll go on my own. You can continue copying the family rules.\u201d This was the bastard who spread the news that he was grabbed by the ear by his wife, turning him into the laughingstock of the whole city. That was why he couldn\u2019t help but feel a surge of rage every time he saw Cheng Shouping.Cheng Shouping widened his eyes in disbelief. \u201c???\u201dOld master, do you not dote on me anymore? Old master, what did I do so wrong? Old master\u2026It was only after seeing that the snack box on the table that Chu Zhongtian had left behind that Cheng Shouping heaved a sigh of relief. Looks like the old master still cares about me.Meanwhile, Zu An was still suffering from his injuries in his room when he received a notification coming from the system.You have successfully trolled Chu Zhongtian for +283 Rage!Ah? It\u2019s my father-in-law this time around? What in the world happened for even a kind man like him to end up losing his temper too?While Zu An was perplexed, an incensed figure barged into his room. \u201cYou brat! You\u2019re indeed here!\u201d\u201cFather-in-law.\u201d Zu An struggled to rise from his bed, only to fail in the end. \u201cPardon me. I\u2019m injured at the moment, so I can\u2019t get up to greet you properly\u2026\u201dThose words, \u2018father-in-law\u2019, made Chu Zhongtian\u2019s eyelids twitch uncontrollably. For some reason, it felt incredibly uncomfortable for him to hear those words from Zu An. However, before he could think deeper into it, he suddenly noticed the details in Zu An\u2019s words and exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cYou\u2019re injured!\u201d\u201cYes, father-in-law.\u201d Zu An looked at Chu Zhongtian indignantly.Chu Zhongtian hurriedly rushed forward to inspect his condition. \u201cYou\u2019re severely injured! How did this happen?\u201dYou\u2019re lucky that Ji Dengtu\u2019s medicine has already healed half of my injuries, or else my earlier state would have surely scared you to death! Despite harboring such thoughts in mind, Zu An replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either. I was walking in the estate earlier when a black-clothed man suddenly leaped out and started beating me up. If not for the commotion alerting the guards around, I would have already lost my life.\u201dZu An\u2019s words were only partially true. It just so happened that there was someone in the estate who was out for his life, so it would be good to have Chu Zhongtian investigate the matter. As long as he could root out those who were out for his life, it would be a happy ending.His initial thought was to pin the blame on Plum Blossom Thirteen so as to have the Chu clan eliminate the Plum Blossom Sect. It would have been a good idea, if not for Cheng Shouping telling him that the Chu clan was extremely opposed to any of its clan members gambling.A distant relative of the Chu clan had once lost money, and the lender knocked on the gates of the Chu clan to demand payment. In a moment of rage, Chu Zhongtian crushed the legs of that distant relative in order to send a stern warning out to the rest of the clan members.Recalling the fact that Plum Blossom Thirteen still had his debt note, Zu An had no choice but to put away that idea.\u201cThere\u2019s actually such a matter?\u201d A tight frown formed on Chu Zhongtian\u2019s forehead as possibilities quickly flashed across his mind. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll tighten the security around the estate so that such a thing never happens again.\u201d\u201cThank you, father-in-law!\u201d Zu An said in gratitude.Chu Zhongtian nodded in response. He ordered his attendant to summon the estate\u2019s physician over before assuring Zu An once more, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your injuries aren\u2019t fatal. You\u2019ll be able to recover soon. I\u2019ll head off first to investigate this matter. For the time being, don\u2019t think too much and rest well.\u201d\u201cBut I haven\u2019t finished copying the family rules yet. I need to get back to the Reflection Room to work\u2026\u201d Zu An struggled to rise to his feet, putting on an act of a diligent student.The guards standing by Chu Zhongtian\u2019s side scoffed silently in disdain. Who do you think you are putting on an act for? Do you think that we don\u2019t know what kind of person you are?However, Chu Zhongtian didn\u2019t doubt Zu An\u2019s intentions. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can leave it all to Cheng Shouping.\u201d After saying those words, he quickly left the room. In truth, he already harbored some suspicions before that someone was aiming for Zu An\u2019s life, and this incident further affirmed his doubts. He would have to discuss this matter thoroughly with his wife to come up with a countermeasure.Zu An could only offer his almost earnest sympathy to Cheng Shouping. Friend, I\u2019ll be counting on you.Shortly after Chu Zhongtian left, someone brought a physician over, who quickly prepared a prescription for him before proceeding on to bandage his body.In truth, Zu An didn\u2019t need all of this hassle. Ji Dengtu\u2019s medicine was extremely effective, just that it would take some time for him to recover back to full health. However, it would be difficult for him to explain this matter, so he could only leave the physician to do what he was doing.It was some time later before everyone finally left his room, giving Zu An some alone time to inspect his own physical condition.He was too severely injured earlier to check on it earlier, but now that he was finally taking a look, he realized that all nine formations on his skin had been fully filled. A short moment later, a new set of nine formations appeared in his muscles all over his body.What\u2019s going on? Wasn\u2019t only 6 of the formations filled earlier on?Zu An could hardly believe his eyes. He rubbed his eyes forcefully before checking it once more, and he was indeed not seeing things.Could it be due to the battle I had with Pei Mianman?Thinking back, I did suffer quite a bit of damage from her. Her strikes had shattered countless of his ribcages back then. If not for the Heiress Ball of Delights, my injuries would have been enough to kill me ten times over.Even though he knew that the effects of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra allowed him to raise his cultivation faster the more injuries he sustained, he never thought that it would have been so fast.One must know that based on his previous calculations, filling the seventh formation would take 13 Ki Fruits, 21 for the eighth formation, and 34 for the ninth formation. That added up to a total of 68 Ki Fruits!Converted into Rage points, even if he obtained a Ki Fruit every ten rolls, he would still require 68,000 Rage points in total.Comparing these two methods with one another, it was indeed far more efficient for him to raise his cultivation by getting beaten up than to rely on his Rage points.Maybe I should try to get myself beaten up in the future?It was not as if he was a masochist, but the rewards were really tempting.However, after a short moment of excitement, he soon tossed the idea aside. The reason why he was able to make such a huge gain today was due to the effects of the Heiress Ball of Delights. If not for it, he would have already died many times over.The Heiress Ball of Delights only had one use left, and he couldn\u2019t afford to squander it away. Without this trump card, not only would it be extremely painful, but there was also a risk that he might just accidentally drop dead if he were to get careless for even a moment. He didn\u2019t think that he would be so lucky as to survive the beatings each and every time.All in all, it was best for him to rely primarily on Ki Fruits instead. It was indeed slower, but at least it was safer and steadier.Zu An took a closer look, and he realized that some additional lines had formed among the nine formations on his skin, connecting them with one another. Together, they formed an imprint of a bizarre, massive bird.This massive bird looked as if it was about to flap its wings and soar into the sky. It had a snowy body and a crimson tail. There were several yellow spots all over its body that looked like small eyes.What was more eye-catching, though, was its head. It bore some resemblance to a mixture of a tiger and a demon, yet being neither of the two. It had a ferocious and terrifying appearance that induced goosebumps.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Zu An was a little shocked. He soon realized that there was something similar to a seal at the bottom right corner of the bizarre, massive bird imprint. There was a word on the seal: Grandgale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIs this the mythical beast in ancient Chinese legends, Grandgale?As someone whose battlefield was in the internet forums, it was imperative for Zu An to be well-versed in the Classic of Mountain and Seas and such mythical legends too. Recalling the description of the mythical beast, Grandgale, depicted in the books, it did somewhat resemble the bizarre, massive bird imprint.A thought suddenly came to Zu An\u2019s mind.According to the legends, similar to how the dragon had nine sons, the phoenix also had nine hatchlings too. The first was the Peacock, the second was the Garuda, the third was Fire Phoenix, the fourth was Golden Phoenix, the fifth was Blue Luan, the sixth was Lightning Phoenix, the seventh was Hundredwarble, the eighth was Blue Mallard, and the ninth was Grandgale!You\u2019re asking me why I remember all of this clearly? There\u2019s a long tearful story to it! Back then, when I was taking a written examination to get into NetEase\u2019s gaming department, there were all sorts of bizarre questions. Compared to the nine sons of the dragon, which has so many convoluted characters, the nine hatchlings of the phoenix are far easier to remember!That being said, there actually many different interpretations of the nine hatchlings of the phoenix. He only remembered one of the versions.Zu An suddenly remembered that the cultivation technique he was practicing was none other than the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra. It didn\u2019t seem like a coincidence to him for Grandgale\u2019s imprint to appear after he reached the peak of the second rank.It was likely that a new phoenix hatchling imprint would emerge every time he reached the peak of a rank. However, what were these phoenix hatchling imprints for? It couldn\u2019t be just for scaring others, could it?Zu An had secretly experimented with it, and he found out that outsiders couldn\u2019t see the formations on his body, so naturally, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see the imprint of the phoenix hatchling either. That meant that he couldn\u2019t even use it for scaring others.It was then an idea suddenly came to his mind. He began channeling his ki toward Grandgale\u2019s imprint, and once it was completely suffused with ki, Grandgale\u2019s ferocious eyes suddenly lit up. Following that, the avatar of Grandgale surfaced right before his eyes.Zu An was overjoyed to see that it was indeed working!But what can this avatar do though? Is it like a pet of some sort?After pondering for a moment, he ordered Grandgale to ram itself into the wall so as to test out its might. So, the latter flapped its massive wings, and a huge gale stirred up within the room. The tables and chairs were knocked all over the place, creating a huge mess.Zu An opened his eyes wide as he waited in anticipation for Grandgale to makes its move. However, before he could make sense of what was happening, a powerful force suddenly pushed his body straight forward. In the blink of an eye, his entire body was already forcefully rammed right into the wall.Bam!There it was, a human painting!Zu An slowly slid down from the wall, leaving behind a distinct human silhouette on the snowy walls. Two trails of blood flowed down from the top\u2014it was from his shattered nose.Holy shit!Zu An was both infuriated and excited. It turned out that Grandgale\u2019s ability was instantaneous movement! If he used it well, it would definitely prove to be an invaluable tool in helping him launch assaults against his opponents or flee from powerful enemies.I wonder what the maximum distance is for this skill. Without even wiping away the blood from his nose, Zu An began channeling his ki into the Grandgale\u2019s imprint, attempting to summon it once more.But at the next instant, he suddenly felt his head spinning around. It turned out that he had already depleted all of his ki.It appeared that the skill consumed his ki greatly, such that he could only afford to activate it once a day. Perhaps, when his cultivation level rose and his ki capacity increased, he would be able to use it more often.With a deep sigh, Zu An slowly climbed back into his bed and lay down. He realized that he had accumulated quite some golden substance in the first formation in his muscles due to ramming into the wall.Earlier in the day, he heard Ji Xiaoxi mentioning that reaching the third rank allowed a cultivator to release their qi externally and form armor or barriers to fend against attacks. While he was still at the first step, there was no doubt that he was a full-fledged third rank cultivator now.Excited to test out his newly-gained ability, he tried his best to squeeze out whatever ki he had left in his body. Eventually, he managed to form a barrier that was not even the size of a palm in front of him, but it dissipated right away due to the lack of ki to sustain it.Nevertheless, Zu An was still overjoyed. Theoretically speaking, he should wield the strength comparable to that of 88 adult men now, which would make him pretty much a weaker version of superman in his previous life. Even if he couldn\u2019t beat the top few in the Marvel Universe like Hulk and Ironman, he should at least be able to beat the pushovers, Black Widow and Hawkeye, with ease.That, together with Poisonous Prick and Grandgale, would be his key to surviving in the Chu Estate. No matter who was aiming for his life, he was at least able to put up a fight now.After the short moment of happiness came the onset of pain. With nothing else to distract him anymore, he began hissing in pain from the bruises he had sustained all over his body. \u201cArgh, the earlier ram sure is painful!\u201dHe was already on the verge of healing from his wounds, but the earlier ram caused him to sustain new injuries. Not daring to mess around anymore, he lay quietly on the bed and waited patiently for Ji Dengtu\u2019s recovery medicine to work its wonders. Unknowingly, he fell asleep.The following day, Zu An woke up feeling a little feeble even after a night\u2019s rest. He had recovered from almost half of his initial injuries, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little dissatisfied with the effects. It looked like he was overestimating Ji Dengtu by putting his recovery medicine on the same level as Faith in Brother Spring.If others were to learn of his thoughts, they would surely grab a chopper and chase him around town. One must know that the Hundredflower Impermanence Pill was a divine medicine that innumerable cultivators would get down on their knees for, but he actually viewed it as an inferior recovery medicine. Unforgivable!It was then that Zu An suddenly recalled something\u2014he had forgotten to draw the lottery. Too many things had happened yesterday night that it slipped his mind. So, he took out the keyboard and checked his Rage points. Initially, he only had 69 points left, but after earning a fair bit from the Chu Zhongtian, Qin Wanru, and Pei Mianman, the amount rose up to 3273.He couldn\u2019t help but frown in discontentment. It seemed like he had gone easy yesterday night, or else there was no way he would have only obtained this much Rage points from Pei Mianman. But again, faced with that kind of top-notch beauty, there was no man who would be able to bring themselves to really be harsh on her.All of a sudden, he started to miss Plum Blossom Twelve and the lot from the Blackwind Stockade. He began reminiscing those good memories that he made with them.Heaven, please bestow me with an antagonist whom I can antagonize!Whoosh!The door was suddenly pushed open, and a suave young man with his hair combed neatly in place barged right in. He walked up to the bedside and gazed down on him loftily, \u201cHow far have your injuries recovered? Are you able to go to the academy today?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +299 Rage!\u201cI\u2019m still alright, I guess,\u201d Zu An replied subconsciously. \u201cNo, wait a moment. Who are you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Without bothering to answer him, the young man turned around and headed out of the room. On his way out, he caught sight of the human-shaped imprint on the wall in his peripheral vision, and he froze in place for a moment. However, it took only a moment for him to regain his composure, and he left the room with his chest puffed out and his head up high.Zu An was still a little dazed. It was just a moment ago that I made a wish, and they really sent me an antagonist to antagonize? Surely my prayers can\u2019t be that effective? But speaking of which, who is that fellow though? Why is he contributing so many Rage points even though it\u2019s the first time we\u2019re meeting one another?\u201cYoung master~\u201d It was then that a grudging voice sounded by the doorway. Cheng Shouping appeared by the doorway wearing two heavy eyebags.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Did a vixen suck out your yang essence?\u201d Zu An jolted in shock.Cheng Shouping tottered over weakly. \u201cYoung master, how can you say such a thing? I had to spend the entire night up, not sleeping a wink at all in order to copy the family rules a hundred times all on my own!\u201dZu An smiled sheepishly as he got up and poured him a cup of water. \u201cLittle Pingping, you should be glad that you were in the Reflection Room copying the family rules yesterday night. If you were together with me, you would have turned into a corpse by now.\u201d\u201cThanks, young master.\u201d Cheng Shouping first accepted Zu An\u2019s cup of water humbly before his mind managed to process the words that had just been spoken. \u201cWait a moment. What do you mean by \u2018I would have turned into a corpse by now\u2019?\u201dZu An pointed to the human-shaped imprint on the wall and said, \u201cDo you see that? An assassin dropped by yesterday night to assassinate me. It\u2019s only thanks to the blessings of heaven and my superior skills that I managed to escape the ordeal. If you were around too, you would have been forced to put your life on the line to save me. There\u2019s no saying that the enemy\u2019s dagger might have just plunged right into your brittle body and tore it apart.\u201dCheng Shouping gulped fearfully as he muttered, \u201cThank god I was in the Reflection Room.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zu An\u2019s eyebrows shot up.Cheng Shouping immediately replied with a fawning smile, \u201cI said that it was a pity that I wasn\u2019t around. A person as loyal as me would have surely put my life on the line to protect you. That assassin would have to step over my dead body before he can lay his hands on you!\u201dSeeing how Cheng Shouping was speaking so impassionedly, such that his saliva was flying all around the place, Zu An quickly shoved his face aside. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of you. Aren\u2019t you getting too into the script? Let me ask you something instead. Who\u2019s that proud-looking fellow who just walked out earlier?\u201d\u201cHim? He\u2019s the precious son of Butler Hong, Hong Xingying,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied. \u201cThat fellow is a conceited punk, but there\u2019s no denying that he\u2019s a prodigious cultivator. Despite having never gone through any formal education, he managed to self-study on his own and reach the third rank. Butler Hong has always been proud of him, and the old master and old mistress are full of compliments for him too. They are expecting him to become one of the leaders of the younger generation in the Chu Estate, and they have been grooming him as such too.\u201dAh, so he\u2019s the son of Butler Hong. It\u2019s no wonder why his hair is combed so impeccably, just like his father.\u201cTsk, I was still wondering how formidable he is. After cultivating for over a decade, he has only managed to reach the third rank?\u201d Zu An scoffed. A trash like me has managed to reach the third rank in just three days, but even I don\u2019t go around boasting about it!Meanwhile, Cheng Shouping shook his head wryly. It\u2019s no wonder why they say that the young master has his heads in the clouds. Despite being utterly incapable, he still runs his mouth as if he\u2019s a bigshot. If you can reach the third rank in your lifetime, I bet even the old master and old mistress would laugh in their sleep!\u201cWhy are you staring at me like that?\u201d Zu An glared at Cheng Shouping.Cheng Shouping immediately put a smile back onto his face. \u201cI was thinking that maybe I should tell the old mistress to let you rest for the day, given how severely injured you are.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. This bit of injuries won\u2019t hinder me. My father-in-law and mother-in-law are asking me to attend the academy for my own good, so how can I let them down?\u201d Zu An thumped his chest as he spoke resolutely. Needless to say, he wasn\u2019t interested in attending the academy, but it was far more boring to remain in the estate.Due to the assassination yesterday night, Chu Zhongtian had stationed two guards at the entrance of his room, such that he couldn\u2019t sneak out even if he wanted to. Given so, he would rather go to the academy instead. Perhaps, he might just find a chance to slip away and do his own stuff.Hearing Zu An\u2019s motivated speech, Cheng Shouping\u2019s mouth opened so wide that one could stuff a fist down his throat. He immediately rushed forward and placed his hand on Zu An\u2019s forehead. \u201cYoung master, what\u2019s wrong with you? Are you having a fever?\u201d\u201cScram!\u201d Zu An kicked him aside.\u201cHahaha! Zu An, you\u2019re really becoming more and more mature. It looks like the effort I have spent on you isn\u2019t in vain!\u201d A peal of laughter sounded outside, and Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru walked in with satisfied smiles on their faces.\u201cFather-in-law, mother-in-law, what are you doing here?\u201d Zu An quickly put on a flattered look on his face. Ah, it sure is hard having to put on an act every day. At this rate, I might be eligible for the Oscars if I transmigrate back to my previous world.\u201cI heard from Xingying that you have recovered from your injuries and are intending to head to the academy. I was a little worried, so I came over to take a look.\u201d Qin Wanru\u2019s usual stern face had a tinge of gentleness to it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI thought things through yesterday, and I felt that you were sending me to the academy for my own good too.\u201d It was then that Zu An noticed Hong Xingying standing behind the two of them. The latter had a nonchalant look on his face, and he wasn\u2019t even looking him in the eye at all. Why does this fellow keep putting on such a cold look before me? It\u2019s almost as if I owe him hundreds of silver taels!\u201cYou have wisened up quite a lot,\u201d Chu Zhongtian remarked in a good mood as he stroked his beard. \u201cChuyan will be delighted to hear this too.\u201dThe word \u2018Chuyan\u2019 brought a slightly zealous look to Hong Xingying eyes for a moment, but he quickly concealed it.Qin Wanru told Zu An, \u201cSince you have decided to go to the academy, you should have Xingying accompany you. He\u2019ll also be attending the academy from today onward too. It\u2019ll be good if the two of you can look after one another. Xingying is a smart and mature child, so I\u2019m sure you can learn a lot from him.\u201dHong Xingying quickly lowered his head and said, \u201cMadame, you\u2019re flattering me. I\u2019ll do my best to take care of him.\u201dZu An clicked his tongue quietly. It is \u2018looking after one another\u2019 if you put it in a good way, but if you put it crudely, you\u2019re basically using him to keep an eye on me. They must be quite worried after I played truant yesterday, so they sent someone here to prevent such things from happening again.At the same time, Zu An also realized why Hong Xingying was so angry earlier on. It wasn\u2019t easy for the latter to get an opportunity to attend the academy, but due to him getting injured, the latter nearly couldn\u2019t go anymore. It was only natural for him to get angry.While the academies here preached education without discrimination, it wasn\u2019t that easy to get into an academy. At the very least, they would have to prove their talent. In a sense, Zu An got an easy pass into the academy through the connections.Others like Hong Xingying and the other servants of the Chu clan, as long as their master refused to give their approval, it would be nigh impossible for them to get into the academy.Shouldn\u2019t Hong Xingying be thankful to me then? If not for me, how could he get a chance to attend the academy?While Zu An had earned quite a bit of Rage points, he was still a bit displeased about this. He felt like he had lost more than he had earned on this.Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru continued lecturing him a bit longer before taking their leave. Hong Xingying also flung his head around and left the room too.Following that, Zu An began to wash up and prepare himself. Someone delivered breakfast to him at some point in time, so he had Cheng Shouping sit down and eat together with him.Unexpectedly, his thoughtless action caused the latter to tear up.Young master, even though you\u2019re a little dumb, boastful, and incapable\u2026 you treat me really well! You don\u2019t think of me as a subordinate. Yes, I\u2019ve decided. I\u2019ll help you to gain a footing in the Chu clan no matter what!If Zu An were to be aware of his thoughts, he would probably send a kick right in his face.\u201cCough cough!\u201d A hunched back passed by the window then.Zu An, who was in the midst of his meal, heard a voice in his ears, \u201cDon\u2019t you play truant today. Remember to look for Wei Hongde.\u201dBy the time Zu An raised his head to take a closer look, Old Mi\u2019s figure was already nowhere to be seen.\u201cDid you hear a voice earlier?\u201d Zu An nudged Cheng Shouping and asked.\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything at all. Burp~\u201d Cheng Shouping was too engrossed in his food that his line of sight had never left the table.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of choking to death?\u201d Zu An rolled his eyes in disdain. However, thinking about the earlier words he had just heard made a shiver run down his spine. For some reason, he was a little afraid of this mysterious old man. Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru felt docile in comparison to him.It seemed like he would do well to take a good look around the academy today.After finishing his meal, Cheng Shouping helped Zu An pack some daily necessities. By the time they walked out of the door, Hong Xingying was already waiting outside with a sword in his arms. Upon seeing the duo, he asked impatiently, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +99 Rage!Is there a problem with this lad?Zu An couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. \u201cAre you the young master or am I the young master? What\u2019s wrong with waiting for a while?\u201d\u201cSo what if you\u2019re the young master? There\u2019s no one in the Chu Estate who doesn\u2019t know of your background. You think that you can scare me?\u201d Hong Xingying sneered coldly.Zu An assessed him from head-to-toe. \u201cDo I owe you money?\u201dHong Xingying was stunned by the abrupt question. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cThen why do you carry such great enmity toward me?\u201d Zu An asked.Hong Xingying\u2019s body stiffened. He didn\u2019t expect Zu An to actually confront him directly. He took a glance at Cheng Shouping, and in the end, he chose to approach the matter carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t carry enmity for you. I just think that it\u2019s a huge pity for the First Miss. The First Miss is such a talented and wonderful person. A man like you will never be a match for her!\u201dCheng Shouping protested weakly upon hearing those words, \u201cThis\u2026 He\u2019s the young master after all. It isn\u2019t appropriate for you to say such words.\u201dZu An was amused by Cheng Shouping\u2019s response. I didn\u2019t think this lad would stick his head out for me before someone else.Hong Xingying glanced at Cheng Shouping coldly. \u201cIs there anything wrong with I have just said? Why don\u2019t you point out his strengths to me then?\u201dCheng Shouping was stifled for a long time before he finally came up with a response, \u201cWhile the young master doesn\u2019t have any talents, at least his appearance is passable!\u201dThe infuriated Zu An immediately shoved Cheng Shouping aside. He really thought that it was a miracle that this fellow could survive in the Chu clan to this day with how foul his mouth was! \u201cAh, I get it now. In other words, you\u2019re Chuyan\u2019s admirer!\u201dHong Xingying\u2019s fair face immediately reddened upon hearing those words. \u201cWho says so! I\u2019m not her admirer! Stop talking nonsense!\u201dSeeing the triple denial combo coming from Hong Xingying, Zu An couldn\u2019t resist prodding on. \u201cA capable servant and a beautiful mistress; what a beautiful yet tragic love story! Still, don\u2019t you think that you\u2019re shameless to actually covet another man\u2019s wife?\u201d\u201cYou!!!\u201d Hong Xingying glared at Zu An before turning his head away with a harrumph. He didn\u2019t want to waste his breath arguing with the latter anymore!You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +100 Rage!Unfortunately for Hong Xingying, Zu An had no plans on letting him off so easily. He walked up to Hong Xingying and placed his arm around his shoulders. \u201cFine fine, let me put it in another way then. It\u2019s the woman you love who became my wife. That makes you sound less like an asshole for coveting my wife, right? Do you feel better now?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +333 Rage!Hong Xingying gnashed his teeth in anger as he gripped the handle of his sword tightly. However, he managed to hold himself back from drawing his sword in the end. Taking a deep breath, he said, \u201cAll you\u2019re capable of is running your mouth! Hah, just you wait! The academy treats everyone equally. By then, I shall have you know the gap that stands between you and me!\u201dZu An chuckled softly. \u201cI admire your confidence. You put on one face before my father-in-law and mother-in-law, only to act in a different manner behind their backs. Aren\u2019t you afraid that I would report this matter to them?\u201dHong Xingying was unfazed by the threat. \u201cGo ahead and tell them then. Let\u2019s see whether they\u2019ll believe a trash like you or a capable servant like me.\u201dZu An pulled Cheng Shouping over and said, \u201cI have an eye-witness here.Cheng Shouping immediately shook his head frantically. \u201cI didn\u2019t see or hear anything at all.\u201dZu An felt like something was going to snap in his head. \u201cWhy are you acting so cowardly?\u201dSeeing this farce, Hong Xingying sneered coldly. \u201cForce him all you want to, but it\u2019s futile. If there\u2019s one person that the old master and the old mistress trust the least in this estate, it\u2019s him.\u201dAfter saying his piece, Hong Xingying walked ahead of them, pulling some distance between him and Zu An. It was almost as if he felt disgusted just by standing next to trash like them.Zu An and Cheng Shouping were left staring at one another speechlessly at the back. Sighing deeply, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but remark, \u201cHow in the world did you end up in such a miserable position? You should consider just smashing your head into that pillar over there and ending your life.\u201dCheng Shouping retorted indignantly. \u201cYou have fallen so low that even a servant dares to criticize you, and you still dare to pick flaws with me.\u201dZu An harrumphed coldly before turning his gaze to the young man, who was walking away from them. A smile slowly formed on his lips. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to stumble before a perfect prey like you. I should take my time milking you, or else you might just collapse before I have my fill of Rage points.The group of three soon arrived at the entrance of Brightmoon Academy. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but glance in the direction of the path branching to the side, and the image of a carefree woman swirling a gourd of wine flashed across his mind. He wondered if he would be able to meet her once more in the future.There were fewer people queuing up at the entrance of the academy as compared to yesterday. Zu An was bored while waiting for his turn to enter, so he began looking around. Very soon, he noticed a pair of guy and girl tugging one another, seemingly chatting about something.The man was quite good-looking, but he smelled of powder and perfume. His skin was fairer than most women, and from time to time, his eyes would twinkle seductively. Zu An wondered if this was the stereotypical cross-dressing plotline that he often saw in historical dramas.I\u2019m not as foolish as Liang Shanbo. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll let something as good as this slip past me!So, Zu An walked over and wrapped his arm around that \u2018man\u2019s\u2019 shoulders. \u201cHey bro, have we met each other before?\u201dYou\u2019re the one who wants to cross-dress as a guy, so you can\u2019t complain even if I take advantage of you a little. Hahaha~\u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d That \u2018man\u2019 was a little confused. He was clearly trying to recall if he had ever met Zu An before.Zu An was a little taken aback. He didn\u2019t expect this \u2018man\u2019 to respond so nonchalantly. His gaze slowly moved downward, and he soon spotted the Adam\u2019s apple on his throat. In an instant, he felt something churning in his stomach. Shit, it\u2019s just a guy who looks like a girl!As if he had been shocked, he immediately retracted his arm and said, \u201cMy bad, I got the wrong person.\u201dThe woman standing opposite to the man glared at Zu An as if he was an idiot, displeased that he had suddenly barged into their conversation. \u201cSigh. Where did we stop?\u201d\u201cAh yes, I remember it now. Big brother Xiu, just what did I do wrong for you that irked you so much? Tell me, and I\u2019ll change! Why must we break up with one another?\u201d The woman had a beautiful appearance, and she looked incredibly pitiful with tears glistening in her eyes.Zu An assessed the feminine man closely. Is this sort of man considered charming in this world? Even if I were to be compared with him\u2026 Sigh, let\u2019s not talk about such a depressing topic.The man reached out to grab the woman\u2019s hand, and he spoke with a voice brimming with emotions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019m just scared that\u2026 I won\u2019t love you anymore in the future. So, I want to break up while we\u2019re still in love with one another. I shall bear all of the pain and heartache alone.\u201dZu An froze up upon hearing those words. This must be one of the trashiest break-up excuses I have ever heard! Holy shit, is this fellow the ancestor of the Scumbag Sect?Those words made the woman burst into tears. \u201cBig brother Xiu, I didn\u2019t know that your love for me runs so deep! It\u2019s all my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have kept forcing you. They always say that distance makes the heart grow fonder. Perhaps, you\u2019ll love me once more if we part for one another temporarily.\u201dZu An\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. Are the women in this world so gullible? I see\u2026 Looks like this is really a haven for me!\u201cI\u2019m glad that you understand me so well!\u201d the man replied with an agitated tone. It was then that the scene took a 180-degrees turn. \u201cNow that we have broken up with one another, can you introduce your close friend to me? I\u2019m referring to the young miss from the Liu clan that you have been\u2026\u201dPah!There was a limit to how dumb a human could be. The woman slapped the man\u2019s face before running away tearfully.On the other hand, the man opened up his fan as he lightly stroked the cheek which he had just been slapped on. Wistfulness surfaced on his face as he remarked deeply, \u201cThe tender hand of a beauty; how it entrances me so.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, he closed his fan and chuckled softly. \u201cI can offer you some pointers if you want to. I am Xie Xiu. May I know what your name is?\u201d\u201cI am Zu An.\u201d Zu An thought that the man\u2019s name was really reflective of his appearance\u2014he sure was a suave man.\u201cOh? Your name sounds familiar. I seem to have heard it somewhere before,\u201d Xie Xiu placed his fan beneath his chin as he spoke contemplatively.Zu An was just about to respond when Cheng Shouping waved his hand at him and called out, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s going to be your turn soon. Come over!\u201dZu An clasped his fist at Xie Xiu and said, \u201cBrother Xie, if a chance arises, I hope to learn the art of how to become a scu\u2026 Pui pui pui! I mean, the art of courtship from you in the future!\u201d\u201cYou seem to be a fellow peer. Of course, I welcome you to do so,\u201d Xie Xiu clasped his fist and replied.Zu An quickly returned back to the queue. In front of him, Hong Xingying sneered coldly and said, \u201cBirds of the same feather flock together. People like you can only make friends like that.\u201dZu An shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cWhat a pity that it\u2019s a person like me who ended up marrying the goddess of your dreams.\u201dHong Xingying immediately lost his temper. \u201cYou dare to insult the First Miss?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +321 Rage!Zu An chuckled in response. \u201cWe\u2019re a married couple. How could this be considered an insult?\u201d\u201cYou!!!\u201d Hong Xingying was so angry that he was about to draw his sword on the spot.You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +344 Rage!It was then that a staff of the academy knocked on the door and shouted, \u201cWhat are you causing a ruckus for? Those who dare to cause trouble will be immediately stripped of their qualifications as a student!\u201dIn the face of such a threat, Hong Xingying could only put aside his anger and turn his head to the front. He thought that it would be a huge loss if he were to ruin his own future over a wastrel like Zu An. Just wait till I accrue some accomplishments in the academy. I shall free myself from the position of a servant, and I won\u2019t have to hold back anymore!Meanwhile, Zu An felt that it was a pity that they were stopping here. He shook his head in disappointment before turning his attention to Cheng Shouping. \u201cWhat\u2019s the background of that man named Xie Xiu?\u201dCheng Shouping replied, \u201cHe\u2019s the Second Young Master of the City Lord Estate.\u201d Then, he leaned a little closer and continued with a hushed voice, \u201cHe\u2019s a renowned wastrel in the Brightmoon City. He\u2019s well-versed in zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting, practically dabbling in everything. Be it eating, drinking, whoring, or gambling, there\u2019s nothing that he wouldn\u2019t do. However, his cultivation appears to be his weak point. Due to that, his father is at a loss as to what he should do with him.\u201dJust like you, young master, Cheng Shouping silently added in his heart. But soon, he shook his head in rebuttal. How can our young master compete with him? This Second Young Master Xie is at least proficient in so many skills!\u201cA wastrel? Interesting!\u201d Zu An noticed that Xie Xiu had just approached another woman, and the latter, noticing his gaze, nodded slightly in acknowledgment.\u201cNext, Wei Suo!\u201dZu An was just about to wave to Xie Xiu from afar when he heard the voice of the staff and widened his eyes in surprise. He never thought that he would hear such a refreshing name in this world.He turned his gaze over, only to see a young man of smaller stature stepping forward. He had an appearance that looked reminiscent of a sneaky rat, especially with the two buckteeth he had. His appearance gave him the impression of a cunning man who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do all sorts of underhanded things.Wow, his parents must be prophets to actually give him such a fitting name!Zu An noticed the academy\u2019s staff taking out a crystal ball. The staff pricked Wei Suo\u2019s finger and squeezed out a droplet of his blood onto the crystal ball. The crystal ball emanated a dim glow that would have been hardly visible if one wasn\u2019t paying close attention to it.\u201cLower Ding.\u201d(Equivalent to D-)Wei Suo was initially looking at the crystal ball with eyes filled with anticipation, only for his excitement to deflate like a leaking balloon upon hearing the result.Zu An was confused by the set of procedures. He turned to Cheng Shouping and asked, \u201cWhat are they doing over there?\u201dCheng Shouping quickly explained, \u201cThey are testing the students\u2019 aptitude for cultivation. All students who seek to enter the academy must go through this process. The classes they will be assigned to, as well as the cultivation resources they will be allocated with, will be determined by the results of this test.\u201dZu An was truly amazed. \u201cLittle Pingping, how is it that you have an answer to every question I ask?\u201dCheng Shouping stuck his chest out proudly and spoke gleefully, \u201cOf course! As a qualified study companion, it\u2019s only right for me to find out such details beforehand!\u201dZu An patted Cheng Shouping\u2019s head, but deep inside, he was starting to worry a little. He didn\u2019t think that he would have to go through an aptitude test in order to enter the academy. Given how many Marrow Cleansing Pills he had eaten, his talent should be maxed out by now. Would the result of his test blow the minds of everyone here?For an incompetent wastrel to suddenly become a top-notch cultivation prodigy, such a sudden transformation was bound to incur great suspicion. Would he be kidnapped to the equivalent of a science lab in this world and be dissected for research?Zu An\u2019s first thought was whether he could possibly swap his blood for Cheng Shouping, but the chances of pulling that off were slim, considering that there were so many eyes here.Forget it! If I can\u2019t go the low profile and survive route, it isn\u2019t that bad for me to walk down the domineering route just like the great Chen Beixuan!(Reference to Rebirth of the Urban Immortal Cultivator.)The staff in front called out yet another name, \u201cMa Zhu!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d A slightly plump young man ran forward.The staff pricked his finger and squeezed a droplet of blood on the crystal ball. A moment later, the crystal ball emanated a soothing white light. If the result of Wei Suo\u2019s test was like the spark of a firefly, the result of Ma Zhu would be a bright light bulb.\u201cTo think that it\u2019s upper Yi!\u201d(Equivalent to B+)The surrounding crowd exclaimed in astonishment. Even the academy\u2019s staff began whispering amongst themselves. One must know that there weren\u2019t many cultivators in the country whose aptitude had reached Yi class. At least within the boundary of a province, an upper Yi class cultivator could easily be considered as a genius!It was clear that Ma Zhu understood the significance behind having an upper Yi class talent too. After bowing to the academy\u2019s staff, he strutted down like a proud peacock, enjoying the looks of envy that others directed toward him.Hong Xingying sneered coldly at Ma Zhu\u2019s pretentious attitude. A mere upper Yi class talent, and he acts as if he owns the world. How embarrassing!He had been waiting for this day for a long time. He knew that his talent was top-notch amongst his peers. Putting aside everyone else, he didn\u2019t think that he would pale in comparison even against the First Miss.The only reason why the First Miss was more outstanding than him was due to the abundance of cultivation resources she had at her disposal. A mere son of a butler like him couldn\u2019t hope to compete with her on that. Over time, the disparity between the two of them only grew larger and larger.Over the past few years, he had been doing his best for the Chu clan. He perfectly carried out all of the missions that the old master and old mistress assigned to him, no matter how tiring or difficult they were. Just looking at the ravishing profile of the First Miss from afar was enough for him to feel that his efforts were all worth it.He felt inferior and unworthy of the First Miss due to the disparity in their backgrounds, so he chose to devote himself to silently protecting her. He hoped that she could find a capable man from an outstanding background that was worthy of her, and he thought that he would be satisfied with that.To his delight, the Chu clan had chosen to draft in a son-in-law for the First Miss. It went without saying that those of distinguished standing wouldn\u2019t lower themselves to become a drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan, so those who participated in the selections were lesser nobles and ordinary civilians. As such, he thought that his chance had come.He might be no match for those young masters from distinguished clans, but against this bunch of small fries, he felt that his aptitude in cultivation was more than enough for him to catch the First Miss\u2019 eyes.In fact, there were even rumors flying around that Madame Chu had internally decided on him as her son-in-law. Everyone around him congratulated him as if it was already decided. While he maintained a nonchalant face, in truth, flowers were already blooming in his heart as if his spring had arrived. It was no wonder why the First Miss would direct a faint smile at him from time to time; it turned out that she was interested in him too.Just thinking about how the beautiful and lofty First Miss would soon become his wife, and that he would be able to embrace her fragrant and soft body to sleep every night made him giggle in his sleep.But the results were an utter shock. The First Miss actually chose a renowned wastrel as her husband instead. When he heard the news, he fell from cloud nine down to the pits of despair. He became the laughingstock of those around him.After a period of despondence, rage began welling up in his chest. Why? If it had been an outstanding man, I would have willingly conceded defeat. But this Zu An is useless trash! How can he be worthy of the First Miss?!Is it because he looks handsome?Impossible! The First Miss isn\u2019t such a shallow woman!After spending a long time brooding over this issue, he finally came to a conclusion\u2014it was due to his humble background. He was just a servant in the Chu Estate, so it had never crossed the mind of the First Miss to think of him as a man.Thus, he begged his father to use his connections to get him into Brightmoon Academy. If he did well there, there was a chance that he could become an official and build up his own clan. By then, he would be able to stand on equal terms with the First Miss and have her notice him as a man.So what if the First Miss is already married? Her husband is trash! I can definitely win her over!The only regret about this was that the goddess in his heart was no longer a maiden anymore. However, as long as he could obtain her, all of this wasn\u2019t a problem at all. Besides, isn\u2019t there still Second Miss Chu? She might have a bad temper, but she already possesses moving beauty despite her young age. Just give it a few years, and she\u2019s bound to become a gorgeous woman on par with the First Miss!I have plenty of time anyway! I can wait for her to grow up!\u201cThis day shall go down in the history of Brightmoon Academy. No, the entire country shall remember this very day! I, Hong Xingying, shall rise from dust to become a majestic dragon! Everyone here is no more than my stepping stone to highlight my greatness! Everyone here shall witness history being made! I have waited for this moment for a very long time!\u201dHong Xingying\u2019s heart harbored great ambitions.\u201cNext, Hong Xingying!\u201dUpon hearing the academy\u2019s staff calling for him, Hong Xingying turned around to look at Zu An. \u201cWatch and realize the gap that sits between you and me. There\u2019s not a single part of you that\u2019s worthy of the First Miss. Only I can bring the First Miss happiness!\u201d\u201cTeacher, this man over here has a fetish for other people\u2019s wives! He keeps thinking of taking my wife for his own. Wouldn\u2019t the safety of the other female students and teachers be compromised if you were to take such a person into the academy?\u201d Zu An raised his hand and complained to the academy\u2019s staff.You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +156 Rage!Hong Xingying had never thought that Zu An would be so shameless as to lodge a complaint to the teacher! No matter where one was, those who made small reports on others were always the most reprehensible scum of the world! Does he have no sense of shame at all?Just as Hong Xingying was about to lash out at Zu An, the academy\u2019s staff raised his head and looked at him coldly. \u201cThat student over there, while our academy prioritizes the aptitude and cultivation of our students, we also pay great heed to the students\u2019 character too. I hope that you can tread wisely in the future.\u201dHong Xingying immediately bowed down and said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll heed your guidance.\u201d He knew that the other party\u2019s impression had already fallen to the lowest, but it mattered not. He would use his strength to reverse the other party\u2019s impression of him!Seeing respectfully Hong Xingying responded to his words, the academy\u2019s staff nodded his head slightly before gesturing him forward. \u201cCome over here and have your aptitude tested.\u201dHong Xingying took in a deep breath as he made his way over. Just like the students before, he squeezed a droplet of blood onto the crystal ball. In the next moment, the crystal ball suddenly emanated a blinding radiance. If the previous Ma Zhu\u2019s light was reminiscent of that of a light bulb, Hong Xingying\u2019s would be equivalent to that of the moon.[1] Xiu (\u79c0) has the meaning of being outstanding and good-looking[2] Wei Suo (sounds similar to \u7325\u7463 in Chinese) is a word that\u2019s used to refer to crude and vulgar man, especially those who are licentious or contemptible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How many students of Jia class aptitude does our academy have in total since its founding?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t just for our academy. Even on the level of the entire country, every single cultivator with Jia class aptitude is an invaluable asset!\u201d\u2026The crowd in the surroundings exclaimed in astonishment. Even the teacher who had conducted the test changed his previous cold attitude toward him. With a bright smile on his face, he began asking Hong Xingying for his personal details.This was simply what reality was like. As long as you\u2019re sufficiently strong, a minor flaw means nothing at all.Not to mention, there was no evidence to what Zu An said earlier either. The truth could have been something very different.Hong Xingying walked down the stairs with a gleeful smile on his face, enjoying the feeling of being in the limelight. It was a feeling reminiscent of eating a chilled watermelon on the hottest day of summer. At the same time, he also felt a little regretful. If only he knew it would be like this, he would have never wasted his time serving humbly in the Chu Estate.No matter how well I do, the First Miss thinks of me as nothing more than a servant. If only I entered the academy a little earlier, perhaps, I might have already been of equal standing as the First Miss by now.Such thoughts only made him feel greater rage toward the fellow who had picked up a convenience due to his mistake. So, he walked up to Zu An and spoke coldly, \u201cDo you finally understand the difference between the two of us?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +66 Rage!Zu An was a little perplexed. Shouldn\u2019t Hong Xingying be feeling fulfilled and gleeful right now? Why is he still contributing Rage points then? Could it be that he\u2019s suffering from hormonal imbalance or something?\u201cNext, Zu An!\u201dUpon hearing the teacher\u2019s call, Zu An stepped forward. The teacher pushed the crystal ball to him, and with a cold expression, he said, \u201cA man should rely on his own strength to defeat his opponent. Making such small reports is truly unbecoming.\u201d\u201cWho is the strongest person in your academy?\u201d Zu An asked calmly.The teacher was taken aback by the question. He answered subconsciously, \u201cIt\u2019s the principal, of course.\u201dZu An continued asking, \u201cIf the principal were to slap you for no reason one day, how will you respond to it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d The teacher was at a loss for words. \u201cThe principal would never do something like that. Even if it happens, I believe that the principal has a deeper reason behind it.\u201dZu An smiled wryly in response. \u201cIf I were you, I would report it to his superior. I don\u2019t know how you can criticize others when you don\u2019t even have the courage to make little reports?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Ni Dian for +233 Rage!\u201cCalm down, calm down.\u201d The teacher beside tried his best not to laugh as he pulled his fuming colleague aside. Then, he turned to Zu An and said, \u201cCough cough. Let\u2019s get straight to the test, alright?\u201dLooking at the crystal ball from close-up, Zu An noticed a few nearly indiscernible lines on its surface. Most likely, it was a formation of some kind. He pricked his finger and squeezed a droplet of blood onto the crystal ball.\u201cWhat aptitude could that fellow possibly have?\u201d Hong Xingying sneered coldly as he craned his neck over to take a look.There was a brilliant outburst of light, as if the crystal ball had turned into the sun itself! If anyone hadn\u2019t been blinded yet, he would have been shocked to see that the intensity of the light was still growing at a visible pace.\u201cThe hell! I\u2019m turning blind!\u201dSuch cries sounded all around as the surrounding crowd covered their eyes in horror.Then, with a pop, the crystal ball blew up. It was only then that the blinding light finally faded, leaving behind just glass fragments and a stream of smoke rising from the table.\u201cW-what happened?\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026 upper Jia?\u201d(Equivalent to A+)\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Even a cultivator at upper Jia class couldn\u2019t possibly blow the crystal ball!\u201d\u201cThen, is it the legendary transcendent class talent?\u201d\u201cTranscendent class talent is just a rumor. No one has seen it for the past few centuries!\u201d\u2026A beautiful figure halted her footsteps along the street in the distance. Her lips curled up into a beautiful smile. \u201cThe son-in-law of the Chu clan sure is an interesting man.\u201dWhile the teachers of the academy were discussing the matter intently with one another, Zu An walked over to Hong Xingying\u2019s side and said calmly, \u201cDo you finally understand the difference between the two of us?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +999 Rage!Hong Xingying felt his hands and feet turning icy-cold. His eyes reflected confusion, rage, and embarrassment all at once. He couldn\u2019t understand how such a situation could have happened. It should have been his turn to shine and make a name for himself, but he ended up becoming a mere sidekick to the man he looked down upon all this while. Why is the world so unfair to me?!Meanwhile, Zu An clasped his fist toward those around him and said, \u201cThanks for going easy on me.\u201d He spoke as if they were intentionally damping down the results so as to highlight his greatness.You have successfully trolled Wei Suo for +66 Rage!You have successfully trolled Ma Zhu for +66 Rage!You have successfully trolled\u2026He looked at the stream of Rage points he had just earned, and he suddenly felt that it was not a bad idea for him to attend the academy. After all, he had such adorable classmates whom he could milk Rage points from whenever he needed to.While Zu An was feeling gleeful about this situation, a weak voice suddenly sounded from behind, \u201cYoung master, weren\u2019t you only at lower Ding the last time the old master conducted an aptitude test for you?\u201d(Equivalent to D-)Zu An turned around to take a look, only to see Cheng Shouping staring at him with a pair of confused eyes.How can anyone be so bad at reading the situation\u2026 Once again, Zu An felt that it was truly a miracle how Cheng Shouping was able to live to this day.Upon hearing Cheng Shouping\u2019s words, Hong Xingying felt as if he had found a ray of hope. He burst into laughter. \u201cI remember now, I remember now! He has been through the aptitude test before, and he\u2019s only at lower Ding class\u2026\u201dThen, he began revealing Zu An\u2019s identity, as well as the reputation he had in Brightmoon City.\u201cHe\u2019s the young master of the Chu clan?\u201d\u201cWhat young master? He\u2019s just a drafted son-in-law!\u201d\u201cHow in the world did a person like him catch the eye of the First Miss of the Chu clan?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, he might have some exceptional strengths?\u201d\u2026The bunch of men revealed a crude \u2018you-know-it\u2019 smile.Meanwhile, the group of girls was also discussing amongst themselves.\u201cThat man is quite the looker. He isn\u2019t as bad as the rumors put him out to be.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say! How else could he have caught Chu Chuyan\u2019s eye otherwise?\u201d\u201cHeh. No matter how capable Chu Chuyan is, she still ended up marrying such a useless husband.\u201d\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201dThe teachers who were managing the aptitude test had also heard of the rumors surrounding the drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan. The teacher known as Ni Dian scoffed in disdain. \u201cI knew it! The crystal ball must have been spoilt. Since the Brightmoon Duke has tested it himself, there can\u2019t be any mistake. Zu An, lower Ding, Yellow class!\u201dThe academy was divided into three grades, and each grade was further divided into four different classes, namely Yellow, Black, Earth, and Sky. Those of Hong Xingying\u2019s talent were bound to be allocated to the Sky class, and the same went for the student who was tested to be of upper Yi class talent earlier. As for Suo Wei, who was of Ding class talent, he was likely to be allocated to the Yellow class, just like Zu An.Another teacher was about to say something in protest when his ears suddenly pricked up. He gazed across the crowd to look at the beautiful figure standing in the faraway forest before choosing to hold his tongue. As a result, this matter was decided just like this.Zu An was just feeling frustrated that his \u2018maintain a low profile and survive\u2019 plan had gone to the drain after revealing his talent when he saw everyone coming to such a conclusion on their own. Naturally, he welcomed such a misunderstanding, so he didn\u2019t bother arguing at all.\u201cA crow is, in the end, just a crow. No matter how desperately it flaps its wings in an attempt to scale higher, it\u2019ll never morph into a phoenix.\u201d Hong Xingying walked up to Zu An and harrumphed coldly before taking his leave. It was almost as if his honor would be besmirched just by speaking an additional word to Zu An.On the other hand, Zu An was still feeling glad that one of his worries were resolved, so he chose to let Hong Xingying have the last say this time around. He turned to Cheng Shouping and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be entering the academy now. You can return on your own.\u201d\u201cYoung master, did I say something wrong earlier?\u201d Cheng Shouping asked a little unconfidently.Zu An patted his shoulder lightly and smiled. \u201cNot at all. You did well.\u201dA brilliant smile broke out on Cheng Shouping\u2019s face. \u201cYoung master, you\u2019re the best to me!\u201dZu An immediately pushed him away. \u201cHey, speak properly. I forbid you from speaking in such an effeminate manner in the future!\u201dIt was then that a staff member walked over and led them into the academy. Along the way, the staff member reminded, \u201cThere are activated formations around the perimeter of the academy. Their main purpose is to guard against intruders, but still, it\u2019d best for you not to wander around too much. Otherwise, it could be dangerous if you accidentally trigger one of them.\u201dThose words alarmed Zu An. It was fortunate that he didn\u2019t accidentally wander into one of these formations yesterday, or else he could have accidentally triggered them. That being said, he was a little curious as to how formations in this world looked like. Could it be similar to the formations that Huang Yaoshi set up on the Peach Blossom Island?(Reference to Legend of the Condor Heroes and Return of the Condor Heroes.)\u201cHow dangerous are those formations?\u201d Zu An asked curiously.\u201cYou\u2019ll know in the future,\u201d the staff member replied with a smile that could almost be described as dark. It seemed like he had seen through Zu An\u2019s thoughts.Following that, they passed by an empty field that looked a little like the schoolyard in his previous life. However, what was more conspicuous was the group of youths squatting in the middle of the field.\u201cSquat properly! Let\u2019s see if you dare arrive late again in the future!\u201d A middle-aged man holding a ruler glared at the bunch of youths on the ground.The middle-aged man had a bald patch in the middle, but he forcefully combed his hair sideward in an attempt to cover it up. It didn\u2019t work, though, as he didn\u2019t have much hair by the sides too. The bald patch was still very much visible through the few strands of hair barely covering it.Perhaps it was due to him sensing Zu An\u2019s intent gaze, the middle-aged man turned around and glared at him. \u201cWhat are you looking at?!\u201dOh my, this fiery temper!Zu An wasn\u2019t the type to take such provocation lying. He was just about to argue back when the young man named Wei Suo tugged on his sleeves and said, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t offend him!\u201dSurprised by the remark, Zu An turned to look at Wei Suo and asked, \u201cWhy? Is he a formidable figure?\u201dWei Suo lowered his voice and said, \u201cHe\u2019s the discipline master in our academy, Lu De, nicknamed Baldhead. He\u2019s known for being extremely strict with the students. Do you see the ruler he\u2019s using to beat the students?\u201d\u201cI see it.\u201d Zu An noticed one of the students wailing in pain after being struck by the middle-aged man\u2019s ruler.\u201cThe word \u2018Virtue\u2019 is inscribed on the ruler. Every time he teaches the students a lesson, he claims that he\u2019s using \u2018Virtue\u2019 to win over the students. It\u2019s said that getting hit by that ruler is even more excruciating than being struck by the Second Miss of the Chu clan\u2019s Wailing Whip. He\u2019s not like the teachers we met earlier on; he has great authority in this academy. It\u2019s best for you not to provoke him,\u201d Wei Suo warned.\u201cLook at what era it is now! Is physical punishment still in trend?\u201d Zu An retorted. \u201cIs no one going to stop him?\u201d\u201cShhh, don\u2019t speak so loud!\u201d Wei Suo anxiously rushed forward to cover Zu An\u2019s mouth. \u201cIn the academy, he\u2019s the one who boasts the greatest authority after the principal. Not to mention, he\u2019s a sixth rank cultivator. Who would possibly dare to butt into his affairs? Besides, there are plenty of students in this academy who are proud and like to cause trouble, so it\u2019s necessary for someone like him to curb them. Due to that, his behavior has been implicitly approved by the superiors.\u201dZu An nodded in realization. Out of curiosity, he asked, \u201cI thought that you\u2019re a new student in the academy as well? Why are you so familiar with all of this stuff? For you to even know about my sister-in-law\u2019s Wailing Whip\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, I did my homework before coming here!\u201d Wei Suo replied gleefully. He thought that he saw respect in Zu An\u2019s eyes, and that spurred his desire to boast. So, he nudged Zu An\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cHave you heard of the Ten Great Beauties of our academy\u2019s Sweetheart Ranking?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTen Great Beauties?\u201cWhat kind of overused clich\u00e9 is this?\u201d Zu An retorted. \u201cThis is the kind of plotline used only in old novels from more than a decade ago!\u201d\u201cWhat novels?\u201d Wei Suo was confused by the nonsense Zu An was rambling. Nevertheless, he still continued on. \u201cWho cares whether it\u2019s clich\u00e9 or not? It\u2019s because people like it that it becomes a classic!\u201dZu An burst into laughter. \u201cMakes sense. Go on, who are in the Ten Great Beauties?\u201dWei Suo nodded in approval to Zu An\u2019s response. A good listener should know when to fawn and when to respond, or else the talker would only look like a fool rambling on his own. \u201cThe number one beauty is, of course, the First Miss of the Brightmoon Duke\u2019s clan, Chu Chuyan. She\u2019s like a snow fairy descended from heaven to the mortal world. She boasts great beauty and powerful cultivation, making her the dream lover of 99% of the men in the academy!\u201dWei Suo heaved a long sigh of regret and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity that she married a few days ago, and it\u2019s rumored that her husband is a renowned wastrel in the city. There were many students in the academy who were infuriated upon hearing that news, and they wanted to confront him and challenge him to a duel. I reckon that that fellow is dead meat.\u201dZu An clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles were creaking. He grabbed Wei Suo\u2019s shoulder with a bright smile on his face and said, \u201cWhat did you say? Can you repeat it again for me?\u201d\u201cYowch!\u201d The excruciating pain on his shoulder made Wei Suo realize that he had misspoken. He recalled what he had just heard at the entrance and quickly put on an apologetic smile. \u201cMy bad, I nearly forgot that you were that wastr\u2026 Pui pui! Brother, you\u2019re a dashing man with great charms. You have at least 70 to 80% of my charisma. It\u2019s no wonder why the First Miss of the Chu clan chose you in the end!\u201dZu An looked at Wei Suo\u2019s jarring bucktooth. This fellow is so thick-skinned that I can see some of my flair in him. At the same time, he asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you say that only 99% of the men in this academy like her?\u201d\u201cThe First Miss of the Chu clan is simply too cold-natured. She has a natural disposition that seems to distance others from her,\u201d Wei Suo replied.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zu An thought of the romance novel that she was secretly reading, and the edges of his lips curled up a little. \u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand her well.\u201d\u201cOf course we don\u2019t understand her as well as you do!\u201d Wei Suo grumbled in envy. You have even interacted with her at negative distance before, so how can you possibly not know her?\u201cOther than the First Miss of the Chu clan, who else is on the list?\u201d Oblivious to Wei Suo\u2019s words, Zu An continued asking. He thought it would be good for him to gather as much intelligence on the academy as possible.Wei Suo pondered for a moment before speaking, \u201cIn the second place is Pei Mianman, who just transferred over from another academy recently. Her figure\u2026 Hehehe! Let me just put it in this way, the first thing that comes to the mind of any man who sets his eyes on her is the bed. She\u2019s the romantic fantasies of all men in the academy!\u201dZu An thought of the physical brawl he had with her yesterday night, and he subconsciously nodded in agreement. \u201cMm, it\u2019s indeed a lethal weapon.\u201dWei Suo glanced at Zu An in disdain. You never seen her before, so what are you talking as if you know a thing or two here?Zu An noticed subtle differences in the description between the two women. \u201cIf she is liked by all of the men in the academy, why is she ranked in the second place instead of the first?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s because you aren\u2019t thinking in the long-term!\u201d Wei Suo began educating him with the tone of a senior. \u201cShe\u2019s a dream lover but not a suitable wife. Someone like the First Miss of the Chu clan is far better for a long-term relationship, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s ranked in the first place.\u201dZu An couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by just how much thought went into sorting out the rankings. \u201cYour wisdom knows no bounds! Who\u2019s in the third place then?\u201dWei Suo replied, \u201cIn the third place of the Sweetheart Ranking is our academy\u2019s foreign language teacher\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Foreign language teacher?\u201d Zu An was appalled. \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing as a foreign language in this world?\u201dJust what kind of bad luck is this? Zu An still remembered the days where he was tortured from having to learn a second language in his previous life, and it seemed like history was going to repeat itself once more in this world. Based on what he knew, there was an author called Mars-something that scored really well in his examinations. However, due to him failing his English examination, he ended up getting into second-rate university.\u201cOf course there are foreign languages in our world!\u201d Wei Suo stared at Zu An as if he was an idiot. \u201cDue to the previous great war, the other tribes have been driven to the barren lands. Nevertheless, there are still many foreigners in our society, and they have their own culture, language, and practices. Naturally, we should try to learn about them, or else we would be disadvantaged when dealing with them!\u201dZu An was a little surprised. As he had just arrived in this world, he knew very little about the war between mankind and the foreign tribes. Nevertheless, he could sense the pride and confidence that the humans of this world gave off.It\u2019s good that I got transmigrated into an era of prosperity and peace. This way, I can spend my life in bliss as a scion, Zu An thought in relief.\u201cWhere was I?\u201d Wei Suo took some time before he finally got back on track. \u201cAh yes, in the third place is the foreign language teacher, Liu Shangyu. On top of her captivating appearance, she has a graceful and gentle personality. If it was up to me, I would have surely placed her in the first place! It\u2019s just that those bunch of brats in the academy prefer those of the same age.\u201dSo, this fellow prefers older women despite being a brat himself? Hm, wait a moment! Did he just mention that the foreign language teacher is called Liu Shangyu?Isn\u2019t that the person Ji Dengtu mentioned? Hmmm, it looks like I should find an opportunity to get close to her\u2026\u201cDo you know what is the cultivation level of this foreign language teacher?\u201d Zu An felt that he should gather intelligence properly now, or else he might just die a tragic death when caught red-handed stealing her dudou.\u201cCultivation?\u201d Wei Suo frowned. \u201cMiss Shang isn\u2019t known for her cultivation in the academy, so there isn\u2019t any news on that. I reckon that she should be in the fourth rank at most.\u201d\u201cFourth rank?\u201d Zu An\u2019s eyes lit up. It looks like the gap between us isn\u2019t too big. Does that mean that I can give it a try?Meanwhile, Wei Suo had already continued on. \u201cIn the fourth place is our principal, Jiang Luofu. She\u2019s definitely a queen bee, giving off an air of power. Not only is she beautiful, but she\u2019s also the strongest cultivator in our academy.\u201d\u201cThe principal is a woman?\u201d Zu An was surprised.\u201cWho says that the principal has to be a man?\u201d Wei Suo looked at Zu An as if he was a countryside bumpkin who was blinded by stereotypes. \u201cPrincipal Jiang could have been in the first place, but she ended up sliding to the fourth rank due to her busy schedule. I must say that the brats of this generation really cannot make it.\u201d\u201cCough cough. To dare to gossip about the principal behind her back, are you tired of living?\u201d A staff member, who had been listening to the gossip intently in front all this while, turned around and warned Wei Suo.Wei Suo immediately put on an apologetic smile and said, \u201cAlright alright, I shan\u2019t talk about the principal anymore.\u201dIt was only then that the staff member turned back around.Wei Suo turned to Zu An and continued speaking, \u201cIn the fifth place of the Sweetheart Ranking is the young miss of the neighboring Sunspring Duke, Wu Qing. Just like the others, she\u2019s known for her good looks, but there are rumors abound that she has a horrible temper.\u201cIn the sixth place is the young miss of the city lord, Xie Daoyun. She\u2019s the older sister of Xie Xiu, whom you met at the entrance of the academy earlier. Unlike her younger brother, she\u2019s an incredibly talented woman. On top of that, she has a gentle personality too. In my view, the only reason why Wu Qing is ranked ahead of her is due to her father\u2019s halo.\u201d\u201cIn the seventh place is Ji Xiaoxi, the daughter of Divine Physician Ji Dengtu. She has a miniature appearance that makes her look really adorable. In terms of hardcore fans, she doesn\u2019t lose out to Chu Chuyan or Pei Mianman at all. She\u2019s the love of all lolicons. It\u2019s just a pity that she isn\u2019t my type of dish.\u201dZu An nodded in response. He didn\u2019t think that the young woman he met in the valley would actually be studying in Brightmoon Academy too. This sure was a huge coincidence. I should probably hang out with her more often. After all, my life as a man is banking on her father!\u201cIn the eighth place is the young miss of Brightmoon City\u2019s Zheng clan, Zheng Dan. It\u2019s rumored to be the second wealthiest clan in Brightmoon City, losing out to only the Chu clan. Anyone who marries her in the future will be able to save 30 years of struggling in the corporate world. Of course, that\u2019s nothing compared to you, who married the First Miss of the Chu clan.\u201dZu An sighed deeply. Others thought that he was living a carefree and abundant life in the Chu clan, but only he knew of the difficulties and danger he faced on every step of the way. There was no one in the Chu Estate who really treated him as the son-in-law of the Chu clan.But of course, as a man, he still had his own pride to uphold. So, he put on a look as if he had been flattered by Wei Suo\u2019s remark.\u201cHowever, there are rumors that the Zheng clan is intending to get into a political marriage with the newly-appointed governor of the Linchuan Commandery. I wonder if the rumors are real.\u201d Wei Suo couldn\u2019t help but feel a little indignant speaking up to this point. \u201cIt really is frustrating. There are so many wolves out there but only so few meat. Yet, another one just got taken.\u201dZu An patted Wei Suo\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cRelax, there are still many single women out there. I believe that with your capabilities, you\u2019ll surely be able to find a good wife in the future!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Wei Suo tilted his head upward gleefully. However, when he recalled that the one he was the most interested in was Principal Jiang, he felt his motivation deflating like a leaking balloon, such that his tone also grew a little lifeless. \u201cIn the ninth place of the Sweetheart Ranking is the Second Miss of the Chu clan, Chu Huanzhao. It\u2019s clear that she has the making of a great beauty, just that she hasn\u2019t fully bloomed yet. On top of that, she acts like a rascal, which is why she\u2019s placed near the bottom of the ranking.\u201cAs for the tenth place, I can\u2019t remember her name at the moment. She has a special disposition that makes others subconsciously forget about her\u2026\u201cIn any case, those who are able to get into the top ten of the Sweetheart Ranking are outstanding beauties. In my view, they\u2019re roughly equal in terms of appearance; what really affects their ranking are their personalities and other external factors at play.\u201dHearing Wei Suo\u2019s logical analysis, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but feel newfound respect for him. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to look at things from such a perspective. As expected of a veteran!\u201dWei Suo quickly waved his hands humbly. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind. My knowledge is limited to just theories. I\u2019m nowhere on par with you, who have already gotten some action with the number one beauty on the Sweetheart Ranking\u2026 Ah, why do I suddenly feel like crying?\u201d\u201cEnough enough, the two of you should stop spouting nonsense here. Wei Suo, you should head to your class.\u201d The staff member gestured to the classroom not too far away. The academy was simply too big that it took them a long time before they finally arrived at their destination.Following that, the staff member beckoned to Zu An and said, \u201cCome with me. The principal wishes to meet you.\u201dWei Suo immediately protested indignantly. \u201cWe\u2019re all freshmen! Why is the principal meeting him and not me?\u201dThe staff member rolled his eyes at Wei Suo. \u201cYou got in here through clearing the entrance examinations whereas he got in here through connections. How can the two of you possibly be the same?\u201dZu An felt a little awkward standing by the side. Hey hey hey, should you really be saying these words before me? I\u2019m a man with pride, you know!Hearing the staff\u2019s explanation, Wei Suo had no choice but to resign himself to his fate. He began trudging lifelessly toward his classroom, but a few steps later, he suddenly turned around and said, \u201cMake sure to take a good look at the principal. I want you to tell me what color her stockings are today when you get back!\u201dZu An: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe staff member\u2019s face darkened, and it looked as if he was going to wallop Wei Suo into place. Seeing this, Wei Suo immediately dashed into the classroom to seek refuge.Only then did the staff member turn to Zu An and warned him vexatiously, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to that fellow\u2019s nonsense. If you were to get on the bad side of the principal, not even the Brightmoon Duke will be able to protect you.\u201dZu An replied with an \u201cOrh\u201d as he began to feel a little curious about the principal.The staff led him to a tall building by the side that looked different from the teaching building. The stairs in this tall building were covered with a red carpet covered with exquisite embroidery. It must have been expensive.\u201cHow extravagant!\u201d Zu An couldn\u2019t help but marvel how those in power were always different from the others. Regardless of which world one was in, the grandest building in a school was always the administrative building.The staff turned to Zu An and reminded him, \u201cThe staff office is here too. While most teachers rarely drop by here, it\u2019s in your best interest not to mess around.\u201dZu An replied with yet another \u201cOrh\u201d as he took a look around the staff office, hoping to find Liu Shangyu\u2019s table. But then, it suddenly struck him that there was no way Liu Shangyu would leave her dudou lying on her office table.The two of them walked up the stairs, heading all the way to the top floor. After passing by a long corridor, they were finally standing before the room at the very end. The staff knocked on the door and said, \u201cLord Principal, I have brought Zu An over.\u201d\u201cTell him to come in,\u201d a voice sounded behind the door. Those words were spoken with a formal tone, but the uniquely melodious and rich voice was more than enough to spark all sorts of thoughts in a man\u2019s mind.[1] Dudou: Top undergarment, a bit similar to a corset but not really.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Return to your classroom on your own after you are done meeting the principal.\u201d It was apparent from the principal\u2019s words that she didn\u2019t intend for the staff to enter the room as well. Knowing his own place, the staff took his leave after urging Zu An to head in.Zu An pushed the slightly heavy door, and he immediately spotted a bulky-looking office desk right before his eyes. He couldn\u2019t discern what kind of wood it was made of, but it was apparent in a single glance that it was definitely not cheap.Beside the office desk was a huge bookshelf that was filled with all sorts of books. Zu An browsed through the books, only to find himself astonished. With his enhanced eyesight, he should have been able to easily read the titles on the book covers. However, no matter how he stared, he could only see some blurred, indistinct characters.\u201cYou are Zu An?\u201d a cold voice sounded by the side.Zu An turning his gaze over and saw the principal sitting on the sofa by the side.The first thing that came into his line of sight was her alluring, long legs. Her slightly dark-colored stockings reflected a gleam that made one\u2019s throat dry up from the heat. Her plump thighs, paired with her A-line skirt, created an absolute hidden domain that spurred a man\u2019s thirst for adventure and knowledge. Her tight-fitting shirt highlighted her well-filled breasts, and her beautiful and impeccable face was accentuated by her slender, swan-like neck and her hair, which was shaped into a graceful bun. She emanated an air of nobility and elegance.This was the woman ranked fourth in the Sweetheart Ranking, as well as the principal of Brightmoon Academy, Jiang Luofu.\u201cEnjoying your view?\u201d Jiang Luofu crisscrossed her fingers together as she spoke Zu An with an authoritative voice.\u201cIndeed,\u201d Zu An replied subconsciously with a nod.\u201cBut I find your gaze highly disrespectful.\u201d As soon as Jiang Luofu said those words, it felt like the temperature in the room had plummeted several degrees.You have successfully trolled Jiang Luofu for +99 Rage!Zu An felt a great pressure weighing down on him that rendered him immobilized. He hurriedly spoke up, \u201cSoh cah toa?\u201dJiang Luofu: \u201c???\u201dUnwilling to give up, Zu An continued asking, \u201cI solemnly swear that I\u2019m up to no good?\u201dJiang Luofu stared at Zu An as if she was looking at a man whose brain had stopped developing since infancy. Is this fellow an idiot?Finally feeling the pressure lessening, Zu An rushed forward and asked in excitement, \u201cSis, are you really a transmigrator too? I\u2019ll be your lil\u2019 bro so cover me!!\u201dBut before he could leap onto the sofa, Jiang Luofu had raised her leg up to stop Zu An\u2019s advancement.\u201cWhat transmigrator?\u201d A knit formed between Jiang Luofu\u2019s eyebrows. She couldn\u2019t make sense of the situation. Even though she had heard rumors that the drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan was a wastrel, she had never heard that he was a fool!Zu An was surprised. \u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t a transmigrator? Then what\u2019s with this office wear cosplay then?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you talking about?\u201d Jiang Luofu was utterly bewildered by all of the nonsense Zu An was spewing out. \u201cI acquired this set of clothes in a hidden realm by coincidence. I thought that it looked interesting, so I ordered some tailors to replicate it. Why, have you seen it before?\u201d\u201cUrk. I happened to see them in my dream once before.\u201d Naturally, Zu An dared not give away his background. At the same time, he wondered just what a \u2018hidden realm\u2019 was, but it was a pity that the other party didn\u2019t appear to be interested in explaining it.Following the war against the foreign tribes, as the races began to co-exist in harmony, the culture and sense of aesthetics of different races began to overlap with one another. At some point in time, clothes carrying modernistic elements got in trend. As a result, while Jiang Luofu\u2019s dress-up was indeed a little avant-garde in this world, it wasn\u2019t completely unacceptable.\u201cIn your dream?\u201d Jiang Luofu frowned in contemplation. It was not entirely impossible since all sorts of odd stuff that was beyond human comprehension often occurred in this world.It was then that Zu An suddenly noticed something. His gaze subconsciously moved downward. Given their current positions\u2014Jiang Luofu had one foot raised up in order to hold back Zu An\u2019s body\u2014he realized that he could vaguely catch a glimpse at something which he wasn\u2019t supposed to see.Bam!Zu An felt a great force striking his chest before he was sent flying with a kick.Jiang Luofu\u2019s cold voice sounded. \u201cThe Brightmoon Duke asked a favor of me to take care of you. However, given your wretched nature, I doubt that you can survive for even two days in the academy.\u201dZu An climbed to his feet as he spat out a mouthful of blood. To his surprise, however, he wasn\u2019t as injured as he thought he was. Clearly, Jiang Luofu had gone easy on him. \u201cAren\u2019t you exaggerating things a little?\u201dJiang Luofu looked at Zu An with surprise flickering across her eyes momentarily. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be as weak as the rumors put you out to be.\u201dZu An\u2019s pupils dilated in astonishment upon hearing those words, but the other party quickly continued on, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry. Be it whether you are seeking a leisurely life, or that you\u2019re a wolf cloaked in sheepskin, it matters not to me. I\u2019m not that close with the Brightmoon Duke as to tell him everything I know of.\u201dZu An wiped off the traces of blood by the corner of his lips. \u201cThank you, principal.\u201dJiang Luofu continued speaking calmly, \u201cWhile your strength is greater than I thought, it isn\u2019t outstanding within the academy. There are many students here who aren\u2019t subordinated to the Chu clan, so I advise you not to go around causing any trouble.\u201dZu An puffed his chest out as he asked, \u201cDo I look like the kind to cause trouble?\u201dJiang Luofu blatantly disregarded his question and continued saying her piece \u201cFights are disallowed in the academy compounds, but if both parties agree to it, the right to duel will be permitted. If such a situation occurs, you should know that the academy won\u2019t be in a position to side with anyone. So, you ought to think it through before accepting any duels.\u201d\u201cThank you for your advice, principal.\u201d Zu An was a little surprised. He could tell that Jiang Luofu was really looking after him here. Is it due to my relationship with the Chu clan? That doesn\u2019t seem like it. She did mention that she isn\u2019t close to Chu Zhongtian. If so\u2026 could it be that she has been charmed by my handsome appearance?Jiang Luofu picked up a document that she just received and began flipping through it. A moment later, a deep furrow formed on her forehead. \u201cYour aptitude is at lower Ding class? Impossible! Hm? You broke the crystal ball during your aptitude test?\u201dZu An immediately realized that the situation was going awry. However, he couldn\u2019t deny it since there were plenty of eyes who saw what happened back then. To attempt to hide something that happened in the academy from its own principal was nothing short of foolishness, so he could only admit to it. \u201cThe crystal ball must have been spoilt.\u201d\u201cCome over here.\u201d Jiang Luofu beckoned with her finger.Zu An walked up to her as he wondered if this woman was going to send him flying with another kick.\u201cGive your hand to me,\u201d Jiang Luofu ordered with unquestionable authority.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Despite Zu An\u2019s question, he still offered his hand to her. What happened next left his eyes widening in disbelief. Jiang Luofu straightened up her body before pulling his finger into her mouth!What\u2019s going on? Could it be that the number one expert of the academy, the famed beautiful principal has succumbed to his dashing appearance and is lusting for his body. Is she going to use her authority and power to take advantage of him?What a joke! I, Zu An, as a man, will never bow to such tyranny, even if it was from a beautiful woman\u2026Well, that being said, should I just give in this once? I mean, just look at her! Maybe I should just ask her to be gentler with me later on\u2026\u201cAh!\u201dA sudden surge of pain made Zu An yelp loudly.\u201cA man like you can\u2019t even take this bit of pain?\u201d Jiang Luofu pushed him aside with eyes filled with disdain.Zu An noticed that there was a small bite mark on his finger, and blood was continuously seeping out of it. Meanwhile, Jiang Luofu licked her lips. The crimson blood staining her cherry lips gave her an irresistible touch of seductiveness.\u201cAre you a dog?\u201d Zu An couldn\u2019t care that much anymore. The contrast between what happened and what he expected to happen was so great that his disappointment manifested as rage.Surprisingly, Jiang Luofu didn\u2019t lose her temper at that insult. Instead, she looked at him with a complicated look in her eyes, \u201cYour aptitude has indeed reached the legendary transcendent class.\u201dZu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He finally understood why the other party wanted to taste his blood.Jiang Luofu closed her eyes, seemingly hesitating among different choices. A long time later, she breathed out deeply and asked, \u201cWho else knows about this?\u201dZu An subconsciously took a step back. \u201cDon\u2019t mess around. I\u2019ll have you know that quite a few people know about this. My wife, my father-in-law, and my mother-in-law are all aware of this. There are many people who have my back\u2026\u201dSeeing Zu An\u2019s guarded appearance, Jiang Luofu burst into laughter, melting down chilling air she had maintained all this while ever since Zu An entered the office. \u201cLittle brat, are you worried that I\u2019ll take your life? Given how you willingly bore the reputation of a wastrel for so many years, you must be aiming for something huge. Someone that determined wouldn\u2019t tell such a massive secret to anyone, not even your own wife.\u201dSeeing how confident Jiang Luofu was, Zu An knew that his scam wouldn\u2019t work. So, he bucked up his courage and replied, \u201cFine, you\u2019re right. I have never told anyone about this, but there are plenty of people who know that I have come to your office today. If anything happens to me, those of the Chu clan will hunt you down!\u201d\u201cEnough, enough!\u201d Jiang Luofu\u2019s head was starting to hurt from all the shouting Zu An was doing. She rubbed her temples with her thumbs. \u201cWho said that I\u2019m going to kill you?\u201d\u201cThen why are you asking about all this?\u201d Zu An had even secretly summoned the Heiress Ball of Delight, thinking that he would pit his life against her if she dared to make a move. As long as he used the Heiress Ball of Delight together with Poisonous Prick well, he might just be able to turn the tables on her.\u201cI just want to warn you that you\u2019re still too weak at the moment. If others were to learn of your transcendent class talent, it\u2019ll indubitably bring a calamity upon you,\u201d Jiang Luofu said.Zu An was stunned. \u201cIs it that serious?\u201dJiang Luofu rolled her eyes. \u201cAll this while, the transcendent class aptitude has been nothing more than a legend. No one has ever seen it before. What do you think?\u201dFearing that Zu An wouldn\u2019t understand the severity of this matter, she decided to explain it in an even more explicit manner, \u201cA cultivator possessing a transcendent class talent is an existence that all powers vie for. If they are unable to bring you over to their side, their next move will be to destroy you. No matter what, they can\u2019t afford to allow a rival power to groom a cultivator that holds as much potential as you do. Furthermore, it\u2019s said that the blood of a human who possesses transcendent class talent can be used to\u2026\u201dJiang Luofu\u2019s face flushed a little speaking up to this point. \u201cIn any case, until you\u2019re strong enough to protect yourself, it\u2019s best for you to keep this matter under wraps.\u201dZu An gulped down his saliva as he finally understood the implications of his maxed-out talent. \u201cIn other words, I\u2019m like Tripitaka now?\u201d(Tang Sanzang, the monk in the Journey to the West, the person whom all demons want to eat to obtain immortality.)\u201cTripitaka? What\u2019s that?\u201d Jiang Luofu was perplexed.Zu An quickly changed the subject. \u201cBut earlier on, at the school gates, there are at least a dozen people who have witnessed my aptitude test. What if they were to spread the word?\u201dJiang Luofu shook her head and replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. Transcendent class talent is, after all, no more than a legend at this present age. Ordinary cultivators wouldn\u2019t even think in that direction. Besides, you have done well keeping up the appearance of a wastrel over the years, making it unlikely for anyone to doubt you. I\u2019ll erase the relevant records for you, but you\u2019ll have to make sure to keep a low profile too. Give it some time, and everyone will forget about it soon enough.\u201dZu An nodded his head earnestly. \u201cThank you, principal.\u201dA short moment later, he asked hesitantly, \u201cPrincipal, why are you treating me so well?\u201dJiang Luofu replied impassively, \u201cAs the principal of Brightmoon Academy, it\u2019s my responsibility to protect each and every single one of my students.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Zu An narrowed his eyes in suspicion.\u201cWhat else do you expect?\u201d Jiang Luofu glanced at him coldly. \u201cYou can\u2019t be thinking that I\u2019m fond of you due to your looks, can you?\u201d\u201cI think that reason is much more convincing,\u201d Zu An replied with a nod.Jiang Luofu stared at him for a long while before remarking in wonderment, \u201cIt\u2019s truly a miracle that you can live to this day.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Luofu tossed a sack over and said, \u201cYou can get lost and return to your classroom now.\u201dZu An caught the sack and opened it up. He saw a few medicinal herbs and a red gemstone that was roughly the size of his finger. Intrigued, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201dJiang Luofu replied, \u201cCultivation resources that you\u2019ll need. The medicinal herbs are used for a medicinal bath, and the energy in the ki stone is to be absorbed and assimilated into your body.\u201dFearing that Zu An would misunderstand her intention again, she quickly added, \u201cAll students receive a set of this. This is the amount that students in the Yellow class are entitled to.\u201d\u201cSo this is a ki stone?\u201d Zu An took out the red gemstone to take a closer look at it. It looked identical to the ruby he knew of in his previous life.\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen it before? How did you cultivate up to your current rank then?\u201d Jiang Luofu asked in bewilderment.Zu AN was unwilling to reveal the details surrounding his keyboard, so he quickly changed the topic and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you mention that my aptitude is at transcendent class? If so, I should be at least qualified to get into the Sky class, right? Even if you don\u2019t intend to assign me there, I should at least be entitled to the cultivation resources that a student in the Sky class receives!\u201dJiang Luofu harrumphed coldly in response. \u201cDo you think that I can adjust the amount of cultivation resources you receive arbitrarily? The resources that every student in the academy receives is decided by the royal court\u2019s Ministry of Rites. We need to account for every bit of cultivation resources we distribute to the student and submit the records for checking. If you don\u2019t mind anyone finding out about your aptitude, by all means, take more.\u201d\u201cForget it then,\u201d Zu An replied sheepishly. He had the keyboard anyway, so there was no need for him to take on additional risk just for a few ki stones.\u201cGet lost.\u201d Jiang Luofu was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold herself back from pummeling him if he were to continue loitering before her.After leaving the Principal Office, Zu An thought about Jiang Luofu\u2019s long and sexy legs\u2026 Pui pui pui, I\u2019m thinking about the words that she had just said! It looks like trouble keeps coming one after another. This Tripitaka constitution of mine will surely bring great trouble in the future. I might just get vixens pouncing on me while I\u2019m walking down the street.He headed over to the classroom where he parted with Wei Suo, only to find that the seats were almost completely filled. At the same time, the students in the classroom noticed some movements outside, so they quickly turned their eyes to the doorway out of curiosity.I thought that I was an ordinary freshman, but it turns out that I\u2019m a transfer student who joined in the middle of the semester?The teacher standing on the podium was an average-looking middle-aged man. He was the kind of person whom one would find it hard to recognize amidst a crowd.Clearly, he had received the news that Zu An would be joining his class too. He stopped his lesson and gestured for Zu An to enter the classroom. \u201cEveryone, this is a new student who will be joining us from today onward. Please give him a warm welcome!\u201d\u201cWel~come~\u201dSome applause could be heard from the classmates as they spoke with an elongated yet lifeless tone.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but remember his days in middle school. The scene before him was simply too familiar to him.\u201cNew classmate, come over here and do a self-introduction,\u201d the middle-aged teacher said.So, Zu An walked up to the podium and said, \u201cZu An. Male. Heterosexual.\u201d After saying his piece, he walked off.The middle-aged teacher: \u201c\u2026\u201dIs that all?Some of the female students below began whispering amongst themselves.\u201cWow, he has an attitude. I like it!\u201d\u201cHow suave!\u201d\u201cHe looks like a philanderer though.\u201d\u201cHeh, how can someone as good-looking as him possibly not be a philanderer? Bad guys are more attractive.\u201d\u2026On the other hand, the male students had a very different response. They looked at Zu An with eyes filled with hostility.\u201cThat fellow is really arrogant. I really want to beat him up.\u201d\u201cHow is he good-looking? He\u2019s no match for me at all!\u201d\u201cWhy is it a guy again? Our resources are going to be thinned again.\u201d\u2026Zu An looked at the several hundred Rage points he had earned in an instant, and he suddenly felt that all of his new classmates looked incredibly cute.\u201cHere, here!\u201dFrom afar, Wei Suo was waving his hand toward him. Zu An was a little hesitant\u2014he wanted to find a beautiful woman to sit with\u2014but the quick look he took from the podium earlier showed no particularly gorgeous lady here. Thus, he eventually chose to settle down beside Wei Suo.Tok tok tok!The middle-aged teacher knocked on the podium. \u201cLet\u2019s continue the lesson. Where was I?\u201dHe quickly flipped his book before continuing on, \u201cAh, here it is. Alright, I\u2019ll be continuing the lesson\u2026\u201cCurb the sinners with punishments, and compliment the brave. Reward handsomely those who work for the people, but with tact and wisdom. Enforce the business laws, and evict those who seek to profit illegally. Build the commerce but focus on agriculture, for a decline in agriculture shall spread unease and tear the country from within. Should there be spare food, allow the people to donate them for higher standing. The people will be motivated and not be indolent in their work.\u201cJust like how a pipe with holes will never be full, an official who receives payment not on the basis of his hard work will never work. Rewarding the meritorious with official positions; this is what it means to tap into the wisdom of the people. With the people standing brave and motivated, the country will be invincible. If a country rewards by merit, the country will govern itself, and doubts will be quelled. This is what it means by using politics to reduce politics and to use words to destroy empty words. This is why a system of merit and nobility is necessary.\u201cAs long as a country stands strong, it shall be inviolable. Soldiers dispatched will return victorious, and territories annexed can be safeguarded\u2026\u201d(This is a quote from Han Feizi\u2019s work on governance, Jin Ling, also translated as \u2018Making Orders Trim\u2019 by some citations.)Those long texts made Zu An\u2019s eyes glaze over. He understood every individual word that the teacher spoke, but when strung together, they made no sense to him at all.\u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d Zu An turned to look at Wei Suo with a confused look on his face.\u201cI don\u2019t understand either.\u201d Wei Suo shook his head.\u201cWhat is this lesson?\u201d No matter what, Zu An used to be a university student. It didn\u2019t make sense for him to suddenly become illiterate here.\u201cThis seems to be a lesson on the principles of criminal law,\u201d Wei Suo explained. \u201cThat teacher over there is Zhang San, nicknamed \u2018Sinner Beyond Laws\u2019. He\u2019s one of the advisors serving under the vice magistrate, and he\u2019s well-versed in legal loopholes of the country. He occasionally visits as a guest lecturer to impart knowledge about the legal process to the students. You also know that given our aptitude, it\u2019s impossible for us to progress anywhere in our cultivation. Thus, most of our lessons involve such practical knowledge so that we can do something useful in the future.\u201dZu An had more or less understood the various official positions and their corresponding cultivation level in this world. The lord of Brightmoon City was at the seventh rank, and serving directly under him were the vice magistrate and the chief administrator. Those two can be considered as his right-hand men, and the two of them were at the fifth rank.Under the vice magistrate was the Six Departments, namely the Military Affairs Department, Law Department, Civil Department, Personnel Department, Tax Department, Agriculture Department, and they were responsible for managing matters relating to their own fields. The leader of each department was at the third rank.Of course, the fact that Brightmoon City was a major city played a huge role in explaining why the cultivation levels of its officials were on the higher side. As for middle-sized cities, their city lords would only be at the fifth rank, and their vice magistrate and chief administrator were only at the third rank. As for small-sized cities, their city lords could only be at the fourth rank.The middle-aged teacher lecturing on the podium, \u2018Sinner Beyond Laws\u2019 Zhang San, was in the Law Department under the vice magistrate of Brightmoon City. Whenever he had free time on hand, he would drop by Brightmoon Academy to hold lectures and educate the students.This was a practice that wasn\u2019t foreign to Zu An. There were plenty of part-time lecturers in the university in his previous world too.\u201cHow is it? Isn\u2019t Principal Jiang wonderful?\u201d Wei Suo shot a knowing look at Zu An as he asked. It was almost as if he was showing off his own girlfriend.Zu An recalled that warm yet smooth sensation on his finger earlier, and he subconsciously replied, \u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the color of her stocking today?\u201d Wei Suo asked excitedly, almost like a true fanboy.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but back away a bit to put some distance between them. \u201cBlack stocking, I think.\u201d\u201cAs expected of my goddess! Oooh~\u201d Wei Suo let out an incredibly embarrassing moan, as if just the knowledge of the color of her stocking was enough to fill him up with pleasure.Zu An shook his head in disdain. This fellow sure was a pervert!A sharp whizzing sound suddenly echoed across the room, and Wei Suo cried in pain. A huge bump formed on his forehead.Zu An noticed that a chalk had fallen onto the floor right beside Wei Suo. Who could have thought that all teachers, regardless of which world they had come from, were skilled in this secret art?!But again, it would have just been a slight knock in his previous life, but the teachers in this world were powerful cultivators. If they were to get serious, even a flying chalk could take a person\u2019s life.On the podium, Zhang San looked at Wei Suo with a livid face. \u201cThat student over there, come up here and answer this question.\u201dWei Suo was bewildered. \u201cWhat question?\u201dZu An quietly gave him a thumbs up. This fellow sure is brave to ask such a question.Zhang San furiously bellowed, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, scram to the back of the classroom and obediently listen to my lecture!\u201dWei Suo immediately ran to the back of the classroom without any hesitation.Meanwhile, Zu An also sat upright while cursing in his heart. Damn it, I hate it when teachers ask questions. It always leaves my heart thumping in fright. Just what did I do so wrong to have to go through such torture even after transmigrating over into another world?It wasn\u2019t easy for Zu An to survive till the lesson was finally over. He lay on his table with a desolate look on his face. He wondered when would such days finally come to an end.All of a sudden, a shadow was cast over Zu An, as if the sky had turned dark. He opened his eyes and saw a fatty standing right next to his seat, looking down on him loftily.\u201cYes?\u201d Zu An asked disinterestedly. If the other party was a beautiful woman, he could have still considered entertaining her a little. But since it was just a darned pig, he couldn\u2019t even be bothered at all.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you in the forest.\u201d That fatty left behind such words before leaving the classroom first. A few other students who looked like his henchmen quickly followed him.\u201cWho\u2019s that fellow? Is he ill in the head?\u201d Zu An remarked speechlessly.It was also then that Wei Suo returned from the back. Upon hearing Zu An\u2019s words, he quickly said, \u201cShh, don\u2019t talk so loudly! That fellow is this class\u2019 boss, Man Yu. He\u2019s quite a vicious character.\u201d\u201cYou got beaten up by him before?\u201d Looking at the fearful look on Wei Suo\u2019s face, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a little.Wei Suo could only laugh awkwardly in response. \u201cI advise you to just head there to take a look. If you go, the most he\u2019ll do is to take away your ki stones. Otherwise, you\u2019re just going to get a beating from him.\u201dZu An\u2019s interest was piqued. \u201cThat fellow steals ki stones?\u201dWei Suo nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. They took away the ki stones that I just received. You don\u2019t need to pay too much heed to it; people of our aptitude aren\u2019t going to progress far in our cultivation anyway. Ki stones are useless to us; there\u2019s no point offending that fellow over this.\u201d\u201cBut I heard that ki stones are quite valuable,\u201d Zu An remarked.\u201cAh, that\u2019s true. I heard that they are worth at least 10 gold taels each on the black market, and that\u2019s if anyone is willing to sell it at all,\u201d Wei Suo replied.Zu An\u2019s eyes lit up in excitement. If you\u2019re talking about money, I\u2019m all in. 10 gold taels, that\u2019s 180,000 RMB! It hadn\u2019t been long since he arrived in this world, so he was still more used to the currency in his previous world. It sounded much more relevant to him.It just so happened that he was lacking money right now. If he could just obtain a few more ki stones, wouldn\u2019t the problem be settled?With such thoughts in mind, Zu An found himself unable to curb the excitement in his heart anymore. He immediately leaped up from his seat and rushed out.It didn\u2019t take long for him to arrive in the forest the fatty had pointed out to him. He noticed that the area was a little remote, and there weren\u2019t many people around. Clearly, the other party had scouted this area beforehand.\u201cLooks like you still know your place.\u201d Upon seeing Zu An, the fatty, Man Yu, walked over and stretched his fleshy hand forward. \u201cHand me all of the cultivation resources you received today, and I\u2019ll protect you from now onward.\u201d---Civil Department manages marriage, civil cases, and all kinds of civil-related affairs. Personnel Department manages KPI and manpower allocation.The city lord is equivalent to the magistrate of the county. There is no direct translation to \u2018vice magistrate\u2019 and \u2018chief administrator\u2019, but basically, as the name suggests, the vice-magistrate handles security-related issues and the apprehension of criminals, whereas the chief administrator supports the magistrate in terms of administrative affairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the contrary, he also stretched out his hand and demanded, \u201cHand over all of your ki stones, and I\u2019ll treat it as if nothing happened at all.\u201d\u201cBrat, you\u2019re asking for it!\u201d Man Yu lost his temper. He raised his mortar-sized fist and smashed it down toward Zu An\u2019s face with speed, accuracy, and sharpness. This was the move that he had used to curb countless students who refused to obey him. One strike was all it took to erase every shred of confidence of his victim.You have successfully trolled Man Yu for +177 Rage!Zu An was a little dissatisfied. Despite the fatty\u2019s furious appearance, the Rage points he was providing was lacking in comparison. He calmly stretched out his fist and stopped the fatty\u2019s punch with ease.Man Yu was utterly horrified. He tried his best to retract his fist, but it simply wouldn\u2019t move at all.Seeing this, Zu An sighed deeply. \u201cI advised you kindly, but you just wouldn\u2019t listen. Must things really come to this point? Are you finally willing to hand over your ki stones now?\u201dHis cultivation had already reached the third rank. In terms of strength, he was as powerful as 88 adult men combined. Even at the very most, this fatty was only at a lower second rank, or else he wouldn\u2019t have been sent to the Yellow class. Given so, there was no way this fatty could have been a match for him.Man Yu was unwilling to give up just like that. He raised his other hand and tried smashing his fist down once more, but it was stopped with extreme ease yet again.Zu An felt that he had to do something to make this fatty submit to him, so he decided to tighten his grip around the latter\u2019s fist.\u201cOuch ouch ouch! Let go, let go!\u201d Man Yu was in such great pain that tears were about to be squeezed out from his eyes. He never thought that he would actually be overpowered by this skinny monkey.You have successfully trolled Man Yu for +66 Rage!\u201cCut the crap and hand your ki stones over!\u201d Zu An said menacingly as he further increased the force of his grip.\u201cI\u2019ll hand it over, I\u2019ll hand it over\u2026\u201d Man Yu could almost hear the sound of his bones creaking. He immediately glanced at the pouch hanging by his waist and said, \u201cIt\u2019s there!\u201dZu An was worried that there was some sort of mechanism hidden in the pouch, so he warily released Man Yu\u2019s hand and said, \u201cTake it out and hand it over to me.\u201dMan Yu quickly pulled out his pouch and poured out the ki stones inside. As he placed them one by one into Zu An\u2019s hand, the fat hanging on his cheeks began to tremble.You have successfully trolled Man Yu for +9 +9 +9 +9\u2026\u201cHuh? Only 7 ki stones?\u201d Zu An was incredibly disappointed. He thought that he could make a huge killing out of this, but who could have thought that this bully was so incompetent?\u201cI only managed to gather this much. As you know, the amount of cultivation resources allocated to those in our class is very little! This is all I managed to collect from those I can handle!\u201d Man Yu explained anxiously.\u201cWhat about the ones you have collected before?\u201d Zu An demanded.You have successfully trolled Man Yu for +666 Rage!Are you trying to suck me dry?!A look of indignance appeared on Man Yu\u2019s face as he exclaimed, \u201cI really don\u2019t have anything else. Most of what we collect needs to be submitted upward! Why don\u2019t I just give you 2 ki stones and be friends with one another? I promise that I won\u2019t report this matter upward. Otherwise, once Boss Ye learns about it, you\u2019ll be in deep trouble!\u201d\u201cOho, you even managed to form a supply chain out of this trade?\u201d Zu An was amused. \u201cWho\u2019s the Boss Ye you\u2019re referring to?\u201d\u201cYe Chenliang from Third Grade Earth class, cultivation of upper third rank. A mere First Grade Yellow class student like you won\u2019t be a match for him at all!\u201d Man Yu sneered coldly.A frown formed on Zu An\u2019s forehead. That fellow is stronger than me. This is really a bit troublesome.Noticing Zu An\u2019s reaction, Man Yu laughed heartily. \u201cAre you finally getting scared now? If you\u2019re scared, you better hand everything over to me now!\u201dThis was how human relationships worked. As soon as Man Yu noticed Zu An\u2019s hesitation, he forgot all about his earlier promise of giving him 2 ki stones and instead demanded everything.\u201cYou sure talk a hell load of nonsense!\u201d The impatient Zu An sent a slap right toward Man Yu\u2019s face, causing his consciousness to flicker for an instant. He stowed the ki stones he had just received away and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be taking all of these. Tell your Boss Ye to come and look for me.\u201d\u201cYou skwunk! You\u2019ll wegwet it!\u201d\u201cHeh, air is leaking out of your broken tooth. I suggest you stop speaking.\u201d\u2026You have successfully trolled Man Yu for +666 Rage!When Zu An returned to the classroom, he noticed Wei Suo looking around nervously. As soon as the latter saw him, he rushed over and asked, \u201cHow is it? Are you fine?\u201dZu An burst into laughter. \u201cIf you\u2019re really that concerned, why didn\u2019t you follow me into the forest to back me up?\u201dWei Suo shrugged and said, \u201cGiven how weak I am, I\u2019ll only pull you down if I go together with you. If I get caught and used as a hostage, you\u2019ll have to waste your energy trying to rescue me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re a beautiful woman. Why would I bother rescuing you?\u201d Zu An rolled his eyes. That being said, he still tossed a ki stone over to him.\u201cT-this\u2026\u201d Wei Suo stared at the ki stone in his hand in bewilderment. \u201cWhere did you get it from?\u201d\u201cThat darned fatty saw that I was handsome and gave it to me,\u201d Zu An replied casually.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Wei Suo exclaimed. \u201cThat fatty has someone behind him. You need to be careful of him!\u201dZu An didn\u2019t think much of it. \u201cBacking? Is his backing bigger than the Brightmoon Duke?\u201d Even though he wasn\u2019t highly-regarded in the Chu clan, it was not as if outsiders knew about that. It would be a waste if he didn\u2019t use this card well.\u201cIndeed,\u201d Wei Suo nodded in agreement. \u201cMarrying the First Miss of the Chu clan has really catapulted you up to the moon.\u201dAfter returning to his seat, Zu An secretly asked him, \u201cHow do we use ki stones?\u201dWei Suo was intrigued to hear that question. He didn\u2019t think that Zu An wouldn\u2019t know something that was so common sense. Nevertheless, he still explained it patiently anyway, \u201cPlace the ki stone on your palm and drive your cultivation technique accordingly. Absorb the ki from the stone to nourish your body.\u201dZu An racked his mind, but he realized that there was the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra didn\u2019t contain any techniques that allowed him to absorb ki. Unwilling to give up, he placed a ki stone on his palm and willed his body to absorb the ki, but it was all futile.It was then that he recalled that the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra was an alternative route to cultivation. Instead of the conventional absorbing ki to temper one\u2019s body, it relied on getting beaten up to grow stronger.This made Zu An feel a little frustrated. Had it been before, he would have surely switched out this masochistic cultivation technique for another one as soon as an opportunity arose. However, in his life-and-death fight with Pei Mianman yesterday night, he felt the true prowess of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra.For one, he found himself growing stronger and stronger as the battle proceeded, such that he was actually able to rival her in terms of strength. On top of that, he realized that for every cultivation rank he mastered, he would gain a phoenix hatchling imprint. No matter how foolish he was, it was apparent to him that this technique possessed extraordinary prowess. It would be a waste to give up on it.If so, that would mean that ki stones were completely useless to him. Zu An took some time to ponder over this issue before nudging the fellow seated beside him. \u201cHey, lad. You want to buy my ki stones?\u201dWei Suo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cHow many do you have?\u201d\u201cI have 7 of them,\u201d Zu An replied. If he could sell them for 10 gold taels each, factoring in the silver taels that he had saved up thus far, he would be able to repay his 1000 silver taels debt.Of course, he was reluctant to fork out his own money to repay the debt of that dead idiot, but according to the mysterious woman in the gazebo, it appeared that really bad things would happen if he were to break a contract. He believed that it was always better to be safe than sorry.Thinking of the mysterious woman in the gazebo, he began wondering if he would get an opportunity to see her again. Should I find some time to drop by the gazebo again?\u201cHow much are you going to sell them for?\u201d Wei Suo asked.Zu An wrapped his arm around Wei Suo\u2019s shoulders as he said, \u201cYou mentioned earlier that hardly anyone would sell ki stones, making it an invaluable resource. Since we\u2019re brothers, I shan\u2019t take advantage of you. 11 gold taels each. I\u2019ll give you a special discount and round it down. 75 gold taels!\u201dWei Suo blinked his eyes. \u201cI know that I\u2019m not very smart, but you shouldn\u2019t try to fool me either. Shouldn\u2019t it be 70 gold taels after rounding down?\u201dZu An harrumphed in displeasure. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I would have just asked for 10 gold taels each! 75 gold taels is the lowest I can go, and that\u2019s after factoring in our friendship as well!\u201d Zu An passed the bag of the ki stones over. \u201cHere, take the ki stones and give me my money.\u201dWei Suo replied bitterly, \u201cI don\u2019t have that much money.\u201dZu An frowned upon hearing those words. \u201cHow much do you have then?\u201dWei Suo flipped through his pockets before looking at Zu An with large, innocent eyes. \u201cI have 54 silver taels.\u201dZu An nearly erupted there and then. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford it, why in the bloody world did you ask for the price?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I ask for the sake of it?\u201d Wei Suo replied with a shrug.Zu An\u2019s face darkened. He didn\u2019t even want to speak anymore. He pressed Wei Suo down under the desk and began beating him up.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t you say that we\u2019re brothers?!\u201d\u201cIt was a lie.\u201d\u2026The next lesson was a military strategy lesson lectured by a teacher from the Military Department.\u201cTo win without a fight, leaving the soldiers completely unharmed, that\u2019s the goal of a true general. Compliments! Compliments! Through supporting one another through tough times, a sense of camaraderie and a relationship of mutual interest can be formed. Common enemies will be fought down together, and common interests shall be pursued in cooperation. This is the way to winning without losing a single soldier; an offense without a battering ram; a defense without a moat\u2026\u201cWhen a hawk strikes, it pulls in its wings and lies low first. When a ferocious beast assaults, it lowers its posture and prowl warily first. When a true sage moves, it should display the gullibility of a fool\u2026\u201dOnce again, Zu An found himself utterly lost. He felt like a fly was buzzing around his ears, leaving him feeling so annoyed that he felt like he was on the verge of exploding. He couldn\u2019t accept that he had to go to school again after transmigrating and go through this sort of torturous lesson.He felt that he was wasting his life away. It was already bad enough that he wasted his previous life, so was he going to squander this life away on useless nonsense like this?For a moment there, the thought of standing up and walking out crossed his mind. However, the teacher standing before him possessed a cultivation of upper third rank, not to mention that he was an official of the royal court too. In view of that, it was best for him to keep a low profile.Yup. It\u2019s not too late for me to run away after his lesson too.Despite Zu An\u2019s prayers, this lesson didn\u2019t pass by in a flash. If anything, it felt grueling long. By the time the class was over, he felt like he was on the verge of going crazy.\u201cThis won\u2019t do! I must leave here!\u201d With a darkened face, Zu An began making his way out.\u201cAre you heading to the canteen to have your meal? Let\u2019s go together. I\u2019ll treat you!\u201d Wei Suo quickly caught up with him and spoke with a fawning smile. It was apparent that the earlier beating was extremely effective in winning him over.It was then that Zu An recalled that it was already in the afternoon. If he left right now, he would still have to eat lunch and waste his precious money on buying a meal even! In view of that, he decided to eat here first before leaving.\u201cSpeaking of which, given how well-connected you are in this school, do you happen to know a person named Wei Hongde?\u201d Zu An suddenly remembered Old Mi\u2019s instruction. If he were to leave school without making any progress on his mission, that fellow wouldn\u2019t let him off the hook easily.\u201cOf course, he\u2019s my older brother! You know him?\u201d Wei Suo asked curiously.\u201cYour older brother?\u201d Zu An narrowed his eyes doubtfully. Wow, this sure is a coincidence. \u201cBut your names don\u2019t sound alike to one another.\u201d\u201cWho says that brothers need to have similar names?\u201d Wei Suo grumbled. \u201cMy older brother\u2019s name sounds so old-fashioned, unlike mine. Wei Suo, Wei Suo; don\u2019t you think my name sounds awe-inspiring?Zu An stifled his laughter. \u201cYes yes yes, your name sounds much cooler. Is your older brother in school right now?\u201d\u201cHe is. His talent is much better than mine, so he\u2019s currently in Grade Three Earth class.\u201d Envy surfaced in Wei Suo\u2019s eyes as he spoke about this matter.\u201cWhat does your family do?\u201d Zu An asked curiously. He couldn\u2019t figure out why Old Mi wanted him to get close to Wei Hongde.\u201cMy father used to work for the Chamberlain of Palace Revenue, but a few years ago, he chose to move over to Brightmoon City for his retirement. Of course, we can\u2019t compete with your Chu clan,\u201d Wei Suo replied.Chamberlain of Palace Revenue?Based on what he knew, the Chamberlain of Palace Revenue was one of the Nine Ministers, governing the emperor\u2019s treasure vault. Most of those working for him were the trusted eunuchs and servants of the emperor. What does Old Mi intend to do by having me get close to the Wei Hongde?It was then that a disharmonious sound echoed in the air. \u201cBoss Ye, that\u2019s the fellow who stole our ki stones!\u201dSeeing this sight, Wei Suo immediately dashed to the side like a frightened rabbit, as if he wasn\u2019t acquainted with Zu An at all.[1] This is Six Secret Strategic Teachings, Military Secret that is attributed to Jiang Ziya.[2] Wei Hongde sounds like an upright name where Wei Suo has the connotations of despicable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This fellow really knows no loyalty.He turned his gaze over to where the voice came from, only to see a darned fatty recounting the earlier incident in the forest to a young man\u2014not forgetting to exaggerate the details, of course. The young man stood in Zu An\u2019s path and gazed at him lividly. \u201cSo you\u2019re the bastard named Zu An?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m your father,\u201d Zu An replied.You have successfully trolled Yu Liangchen for +555 Rage!It was apparent that this livid-faced young man was no other than the \u2018backing\u2019 that the darned fatty mentioned back in the forest, Ye Liangchen.\u201cVery well. You have managed to provoke me too,\u201d Ye Liangchen said as he clenched his fists tightly, producing a series of creaking sounds. It had been long since anyone dared to speak to him in such a tone, especially from a student from the lowest Yellow class.Zu An shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re a \u2018man of words\u2019. If you\u2019re all that capable, why don\u2019t you bite me then?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yu Liangchen for +666 Rage!A cold glint flashed across Ye Liangchen\u2019s eyes as he readied himself to make a move. It was then that a teasing voice sounded by the side, \u201cAs a fellow classmate, allow me to remind you out of goodwill that the punishment for fighting on school compounds is expulsion.\u201dZu An turned his head around to take a look, only to see a couple chuckling not too far away. The man was no other than Xie Xiu, whom he had met at the academy\u2019s entrance earlier in the morning.Ye Liangchen snorted coldly. Even though Xie Xiu was an incompetent wastrel, he was still the son of the city lord. He dared not to offend the Xie clan just yet. So, he could only suppress his rage and turn to look at Zu An coldly. \u201cVery well. I want a duel with you!\u201dZu An rolled his eyes. \u201cDo I look like a servant who fights you as and when you like? How embarrassing it would be for me to accept your duel! Rejected!\u201dYe Liangchen exploded in rage. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have the guts to accept my duel? And you call yourself a man?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yu Liangchen for +777 Rage!It was then that Xie Xiu spoke up from the side, \u201cA duel needs consent from both sides. You aren\u2019t allowed to pressure the other party into accepting the duel.\u201dZu An knew that Xie Xiu was reminding him of the academy rules, though he already knew all of this due to the principal\u2019s advice earlier on. Naturally, he wouldn\u2019t fall for such a low-level taunt.A hint of viciousness flashed across Ye Chenliang\u2019s eyes. He glared at Xie Xiu coldly and said, \u201cSecond Young Master Xie, I believe that this matter is none of your business.\u201dXie Xiu chuckled casually in response. \u201cIt is none of my business. But as a senior, isn\u2019t it normal for me to offer some advice to a junior who has just joined the academy?\u201dYe Chenliang was seething, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about Xie Xiu, so he could only turn his attention back to Zu An once more. \u201cEveryone says that the First Miss of the Chu clan was blind to have married a wastrel. I was still doubtful whether Miss Chu would really be such a poor judge of character, but it seems like there\u2019s some authenticity to the rumors after all. It turns out that you\u2019re a mere wastrel who speaks louder than your actions!\u201dBy then, a huge crowd had already gathered around the area. Initially, everyone thought that Ye Chenliang was bullying yet another lower grade student once more. In view of that and Zu An\u2019s fairly good looks, almost everyone was subconsciously rooting for Zu An.However, as soon as it was revealed that Zu An was that useless drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan, the nature everyone\u2019s gaze immediately changed. The eyes of the men reddened in enmity and envy whereas the eyes of the women turned cold with disdain. Clearly, all of them looked down on this fellow who possessed no capability at all. What was the use of looks if there was nothing else inside?Zu An found a huge stream of Rage points flowing into his system. It seems like my wife is quite popular after all. Just by learning my identity, all of these male students have already contributed several thousand Rage points to me.\u201cI was still wondering why you\u2019re kicking up such a huge fuss, but it turns out that you\u2019re yet another one of Chuyan\u2019s admirer. No wonder you carry such great enmity toward me!\u201d Zu An looked at Ye Chenliang with a smug smile on his face. He couldn\u2019t help but think of the Ten Great Beauties of the Sweetheart Ranking that Wei Suo mentioned earlier. If I were to flirt with all of them, wouldn\u2019t all of the men in the academy contribute an endless stream of Rage points to me?\u201cShut your mouth! A trash like you isn\u2019t worthy of even mentioning Miss Chu\u2019s name!\u201d Ye Chenliang hollered furiously. In truth, he knew where he stood in the academy too. Despite his seemingly respected position here, he knew that it was only because those from major clans weren\u2019t paying any heed to him. Compared to those true geniuses from the Sky class, he was still sorely lacking.As such, despite his affection for Chu Chuyan, he never tried to make a move on her as he thought that he didn\u2019t stand a chance at all. Yet, who could have thought that his goddess would actually fall into the hands of such a worthless man? There was no way he could stand itSo, when he heard from Man Yu that the culprit who stole all of the ki stones was this bastard, he thought that it was a good opportunity to put that man down before the entire academy. Through this, Miss Chu would realize that this wastrel worthy of her, and that she would be better off choosing him!Zu An sighed deeply. \u201cI\u2019m not worthy of speaking my wife\u2019s name? Are you saying that a stranger like you is worthy of it then?\u201dYe Chenliang took a deep breath. He observed the agitated expressions of the crowd around him, and he slowly composed himself. \u201cI shan\u2019t argue with you. Miss Chu is the goddess in our hearts whereas you\u2019re a coward who doesn\u2019t even have the courage to fight against me. Know your own place and get lost!\u201dThose in the surroundings began shouting too.\u201cGet lost from the Chu clan if you aren\u2019t going to compete!\u201d\u201cHow can a nincompoop like you possibly is worthy of the First Miss of the Chu clan!\u201d\u201cYou are no man!\u201d\u201cYou are no man!\u201d\u201cYou are no man!\u201d\u2026The crowd started off shouting all sorts of insults, but at some point in time, everyone somehow began chanting the same words.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but feel great joy at this. These students sure are adorable. Despite not knowing one another, they are providing me with so many Rage points. That\u2019s another several thousand into my account!\u201cRubbish! He\u2019s more of a man than the rest of you are!\u201dIt was then that a red figure rushed over and stood in front of him.Zu An was surprised. It was actually Chu Huanzhao! He didn\u2019t think that she would stand up for him. It looked like the beating he suffered the other day hadn\u2019t been in vain.The others also recognized Chu Huanzhao too. She was a celebrity in this academy, after all. Other than the fact that she was Chu Chyan\u2019s younger sister, she was ranked ninth in the Sweetheart Ranking, and she took the Wailing Whip along with her no matter where she went. It would be difficult for one to not recognize her.Seeing Chu Huanzhao stepping out to defend Zu An, Ye Liangchen frowned. \u201cHow do you whether he\u2019s a man or not?\u201dChu Huanzhao tilted his chin upward as she replied matter-of-factly, \u201cOf course I know! I tried it myself!\u201dThose words stirred a huge uproar amongst the crowd. Wei Suo widened his eyes as he shot Zu An a thumbs up. Big bro, I shall follow you from now on. You must impart to me the tricks you use to pick up girls!Even Xie Xiu, who was watching the show from the sidelines, choked on his melon seed and ended up coughing violently, causing his handsome face to turn red.At this very moment, the eyes of every single man present turned red.\u201cYou beast!\u201d\u201cYou actually laid your hands on such a young girl!\u201d\u201cThey are sisters! Sisters!!!\u201d\u201cNow that I think of it, I heard rumors that the son-in-law of the Chu clan climbed onto the bed of his sister-in-law on his wedding night.\u201d\u201cOh? But the Second Miss of the Chu clan doesn\u2019t seem to be angry about it?\u201d\u201cGoddamnit, she must have been won over by his bed techniques!\u201d\u201cI also want such luck with women too!\u201d\u2026Zu An nearly cackled out loud. The rate at which Rage points were coming in was increasing exponentially!In contrast to the infuriated and envious men, the surrounding women widened their eyes, and unknowingly, their attitude toward Zu An began to change.\u201cA man who can win over the First Miss and Second Miss of the Chu clan surely has his own strengths too, right?\u201d\u201cIt could be due to his good looks.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think that his actions are that of a standard scumbag?\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s so handsome~\u201d\u2026The discussions all around made Chu Huanzhao realize that her words had been misunderstood. She hurriedly tried to clarify matters, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant! He took 7 strikes from my Wailing Whip without even letting out a cry, that\u2019s why I said he\u2019s more of a man than any one of you!\u201dAfter saying those words, she turned to Zu An with a reddened face and glared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +33 Rage!The smile on Zu An\u2019s face grew even brighter.On the other hand, Ye Chenliang sneered coldly upon hearing those words. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Even if you wish to cover for him, you should come up with an acceptable excuse. Who doesn\u2019t know that your Wailing Whip has the effect of amplifying pain tenfold? There\u2019s no way he could have been able to tolerate that!\u201d\u201cYou think that I\u2019m lying to you all?\u201d Chu Huanzhao glared at Ye Chenliang.Ye Chenliang harrumphed coldly. \u201cYou know best yourself whether you\u2019re lying or not. Try asking the crowd then. See whether anyone believes that it\u2019s possible for him to take 7 strikes from the Wailing Whips letting out a cry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dAll of the onlookers around replied in unison, that this included even Wei Suo too. It was apparent that many of them had suffered the agony of being struck by the Wailing Whip before. Even those who hadn\u2019t been struck before knew of the Wailing Whip\u2019s effect. None of them believed that it was possible for anyone to take 7 whips without letting out a cry.Chu Huanzhao lost her patience. \u201cI\u2019m the Second Miss of the Chu clan! When have I ever lied before?\u201dZu An rolled his eyes. This lass does have a fiery temper, but her brain isn\u2019t as good as her older sister. What\u2019s the point of you trying so hard to vouch for your own words?\u201cWho knows whether you\u2019re fabricating lies in order to protect him? There\u2019s no way we can believe your words, unless\u2026\u201d Yu Chenliang turned to look at Zu An with a smug smile. \u201cUnless you prove it to us right now. Whip him before our eyes and let us witness it personally!\u201d\u201cFine!\u201d Chu Huanzhao exclaimed as she reached for his whip and began walking toward Zu An.Zu An jolted in shock. It was a common saying that those who had large breasts tended to have a small brain. Given that this lass was as flat as an airplane runway, how could she still be such a blockhead?He had finally realized just how powerful the Heiress Ball of Delight was after his fight with Pei Mianman yesterday night. In a certain sense, it could be said to be an additional life to him.He already dearly regretted wasting it once on a bet with Chu Huanzhao, and he would have to be insane to do it once more!\u201cCalm down!\u201d Zu An quickly held her hand down.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you that I ended up being embarrassed here. Let me strike you with my whip once so as to show all of them that I\u2019m not lying!\u201d Chu Huanzhao bellowed in agitation.Zu An quickly told her, \u201cDon\u2019t you find it embarrassing that you\u2019re doing exactly what he\u2019s asking you to? It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s treating you like a servant!\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re right too.\u201d Chu Huanzhao nodded in agreement. \u201cWhat should I do then?\u201dZu An replied, \u201cWhy bother with them? It\u2019s not as if he can force me to duel with him. Haven\u2019t you heard of the saying \u2018Never let a retard pull you down to his level\u2019?\u201d\u201cWho are you calling a retard?\u201d Ye Chenliang\u2019s face turned incredibly dark.\u201cWhoever\u2019s replying to me, of course!\u201d Zu An shrugged as he shot Ye Chenliang a look of sympathy.You have successfully trolled Ye Chenliang for +99 Rage!\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder why everyone says that the sister-in-law is the true sweetheart. I\u2019ll have to make sure to marry a wife who has a younger sister in the future too. I just wonder if her family will be as generous as the Chu clan\u2019s as to offer both of their daughters to me!\u201d Ye Chenliang began his counterattack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was obvious that the crowd agreed with what Ye Chenliang said as they began cheering in agreement.\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?!\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face turned red. Unable to take such humiliation, she flicked her Wailing Whip toward Ye Chenliang.However, Ye Chenliang was already prepared. He nimbly dodged the whip as he asked, \u201cChu Huanzhao, are you challenging me to a duel?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019m challenging you to a duel so that I can rip that foul mouth of yours apart!\u201d Chu Huanzhao flicked her whip once more to strike Ye Chenliang.\u201cThe one I want to challenge is that Zu wastrel! Why are you butting into this as well? Could it be that the two of you are really in a relationship?\u201d Ye Chenliang shouted out loud as he dodged Chu Huanzhao\u2019s attack. He didn\u2019t want to fight with Chu Huanzhao. Even if he were to put aside the background of the Chu clan, just the pain of being struck by the Wailing Whip was something that he never wanted to experience ever again in his entire life.Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face turned completely red as she maneuvered her whip dexterously to strike Ye Chenliang.\u201cZu wastrel, are you really a man? Are you only capable of mooching off women? If you have guts, fight with me!\u201d Ye Chenliang frantically tried to dodge the Wailing Whip as he continued to challenge Zu An to a duel.Zu An shrugged in response. \u201cIt\u2019s with my own ability that I\u2019m able to pimp myself out. Why should I make a move myself when I have others to do it for me? If you\u2019re really as formidable as you think, go and find a woman to stand up for you then? Hah! But looking at your face, I doubt that anyone will want you even if you pay them!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Ye Chenliang for +233 Rage!Chu Huanzhao turned around and glared at Zu An sharply. \u201cYou shut up!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +99 Rage!The crowd also turned completely silently. Xie Xiu had a flabbergasted look on his face for a long while before he finally remarked deeply, \u201cThat man has truly reached the zenith of shamelessness!\u201d The crowd around him nodded their heads vehemently, agreeing strongly with what he had just said.You have successfully trolled the onlookers for +66 +66 +66 +66\u2026Zu An felt as if his heart was fluttering into the sky when he saw the Rage points gushing in. I\u2019m striking it rich! If I knew this would happen, I would have come to the academy yesterday too!It was then that a figure suddenly dashed out and stood between Chu Huanzhao and Ye Chenliang. \u201cMiss Chu, since Ye Chenliang didn\u2019t agree to your duel, it isn\u2019t appropriate for you to corner him so.\u201dThe figure was wearing a white shirt that fluttered along with the wind. He grabbed the Wailing Whip with one hand while keeping the other behind his back, giving off a look of ease. His image was as dashing as one could imagine it to be.A commotion broke out amidst the female students too.\u201cWaaa, it\u2019s Young Master Yuan!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Yuan is truly gallant.\u201d\u201cTo think that he could catch Wailing Whip so easily\u2026 He must have reached the fourth rank, right?\u201d\u201cWhat fourth rank? He\u2019s already reached the peak of the fourth rank! It probably wouldn\u2019t be long before he makes a breakthrough to the fifth rank!\u201d\u201cWaaa, so handsome! He\u2019s so much better than some shameless scum who only knows how to hide behind a woman\u2019s back!\u201d\u2026Those words brought made Zu An\u2019s face turn dark. Those women sure are fickle-minded. It\u2019s just a moment ago that they were still speaking up for me, but they\u2019re singing another tune now.\u201cThat\u2019s an infringement of the academy rules. If this matter blows up, not even the Brightmoon Duke would be able to stop the academy from expelling you.\u201d\u201cYuan Wendong, don\u2019t stick your head where it doesn\u2019t belong!\u201d Chu Huanzhao tried to pull her whip out, but it wouldn\u2019t budge no matter how much force she exerted.That white-clothed man known as Yuan Wendong revealed an impeccable smile as he advised, \u201cSecond Miss Chu, are you intending to get yourself expelled here?\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Chu Huanzhao glared at Yuan Wendong furiously.\u201cI dare not. I am friends with your older sister, so naturally, I wish not to see anything happening to Second Miss Chu,\u201d Yuan Wendong said as he finally released his grip.Chu Huanzhao pulled the Wailing Whip back to her side, but a look of hesitation flickered across his face.Seeing that someone was standing up for him, Ye Chenliang puffed up his chest and walked over up to Zu An. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you a lesson today. In the end, this is a world where you can only count on yourself. Someone who relies on external help is bound to fall one day\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, a gentle voice sounded from the midst of the crowd, \u201cT-that\u2019s not it! He\u2026 He\u2019s actually really formidable!\u201dThe crowd immediately turned their eyes over, wanting to see who was intervening this time around. What they saw was a young woman with a face the size of a palm stepping forward her cheeks blushing furiously. She appeared to be incredibly uncomfortable being in the center of attention.\u201cOh? Who\u2019s this woman? She\u2019s so pretty~\u201d\u201cHeh, look at how uncultured you are. That\u2019s called cute!\u201d\u201cYou must be new here, right? How could you not even recognize the seventh rank in the Sweetheart Ranking, Ji Xiaoxi? She\u2019s the daughter of Divine Physician Ji, and her talent in pill concoction is second to none amongst her peers!\u201d\u201cWhy is she speaking up for Zu An? Could it be that she also\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense! How could a fairy like her possibly have any relations with that human scum?\u201d\u2026The crowd discussed fervently amongst themselves. Even Ye Chenliang was a little taken aback by this development. He quickly put on a kind smile and asked gently, \u201cJunior Ji, what are you doing here?\u201dHe had no choice but to tread carefully here. One must know that Ji Xiaoxi had caused a huge stir from the first day she arrived at this academy. Due to her adorable looks, there were some perverts who began harboring deviant thoughts toward her. Yet, as soon as they came into contact with her clothes, they found themselves poisoned right away. Many of them ended up suffering for an entire half a month.In the end, all of them were expelled from the academy. Some say that it was due to the vast connections Divine Physician Ji had built up in his earlier years. There were many powerful figures who owed him a favor, so they didn\u2019t hesitate to lend a helping hand upon hearing that his daughter had been bullied. However, there were also some who said that Ji Xiaoxi had powerful backing within the academy too.Regardless of which one it was, it was clear that Ji Xiaoxi wasn\u2019t someone whom Ye Chenliang could afford to offend.\u201cI was just passing by when I saw a lot of people gathering here\u2026\u201d Standing before the gazes of so many people, Ji Xiaoxi felt a little intimidated. Nevertheless, she bucked up her courage and said, \u201cI saw that you were all misunderstanding big brother Zu, and big brother Zu wasn\u2019t willing to explain either. That\u2019s why\u2026 I stepped out.\u201dShe really was doing this for Zu An?A disturbance broke out amongst the crowd. No one thought that the drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan, despite being known for his inadequacy, would not only be able to lay his hands on both of the Chu clan\u2019s sisters, but actually be in a relationship with the famous little fairy, Ji Xiaoxi, too!What in the world is going on here?Is it because I\u2019m not handsome enough, or am I just not enough of a scumbag? Or is it my cultivation that women have gripes with, or that my background isn\u2019t good enough?Such thoughts surfaced in the minds of all men before being followed with a massive outburst of rage toward Zu An. Other than their appearances, there was nothing about them that was inferior to that shameless man!You have successfully trolled the onlookers for +99 +99 +99 +99\u2026Looking at the sudden surge of Rage points, Zu An felt incredibly glad that he didn\u2019t sneak out earlier. This decision to have his lunch in the academy was arguably the best decision he had ever made.Meanwhile, Ye Chengliang gulped down his saliva as he stared at the situation before him, utterly confused. What is going on here? I was just trying to teach a wastrel his place, so why are so many women standing forward to protect him?Something must be really wrong with this world!\u201cJunior Ji, what\u2019s your relationship with him?\u201d Ye Chenliang was unable to accept such a reality.\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Ji Xiaoxi looked at Zu An, and her face reddened a little. \u201cHe\u2019s my good friend.\u201dThe reason why her face reddened was due to her recalling how they first met in the river, both of them completely nude. While she did know that he was deficient below, she still couldn\u2019t help but feel a little peculiar inside about having her body seen by a man.In the eyes of the onlookers, however, her response appeared to be one of shyness and embarrassment. This made their hearts turned cold. How can this be? Even our beloved little fairy has been caught by that man\u2019s demonic clutches!Oblivious to the misunderstanding that was going around, she began explaining the matter, There was once I headed to the Hidden Dragon Mountain that I saw him killing dozens of Assrip Wolves with my own eyes. Even their leader ended up losing its life too.\u201dAll of the men nearly burst into tears. It\u2019s all over. Our little fairy actually went into the Hidden Dragon Mountain together with him. A man and a woman, all alone in the middle of the wilderness. The mountains must have awakened their primal instincts and compelled them to\u2026 Goddamnit!\u201cThat man actually monopolized three of the beauties in the top ten of the Sweetheart Ranking! Don\u2019t stop him, I\u2019m going to duel with him!\u201d\u201cNo one is stopping you, go ahead and fight him! If he really managed to kill dozens of Assrip Wolves, you\u2019re just going to be cannon fodder to him.\u201d\u201cHmph! I\u2019m only waiting for Ye Chenliang to be done with him. I\u2019ll have you know that I don\u2019t have the habit of ganging up on others!\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201d\u2026Ye Chenliang found droplets of cold sweat forming on his forehead. He took a look at the lackadaisical Zu An before turning to face Ji Xiaoxi with a look of disbelief on his face. \u201cHe killed dozens of Assrip Wolves? Are you serious about it?\u201dJi Xiaoxi replied with a nod, \u201cActually, I wasn\u2019t able to make sense of how he was able to do it either. However, if you don\u2019t believe it, you can go and ask my father. He can testify for this matter.\u201dDespaired groans sounded from the onlookers. Holy shit! They have even gotten to the point of meeting the parents!Not too far away, Xie Xiu\u2019s attention was on something else instead: Even though Ji Xiaoxi specializes in pill concoction, which resulted in her cultivation being weaker compared to her peers, she\u2019s still a third rank cultivator. Yet, even she was unable to tell how Zu An managed to kill those Assrip Wolves. Wouldn\u2019t that mean that his speed has already gotten to an unimaginable level?And it wasn\u2019t Xie Xiu who had such thoughts in mind.Many other people, including Ye Chenliang, had also grasped hold of the hidden message in Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s words. It was hard to imagine that Ji Xiaoxi was lying about this matter, especially since she even brought Divine Physician Ji into the picture here. Ji Xiaoxi was known to be an extremely good-natured person, such that hardly anyone had seen her lie before. There was no way she would put her father\u2019s reputation at stake for something like this!They would have never imagined that Ji Xiaoxi wasn\u2019t lying over here; it was just that her unintentional word choices had misled them.\u201cI told you! My brother-in-law is a formidable man, but none of you refused to believe me! Hmph!\u201d Chu Huanzhao said gleefully upon seeing how she had managed to turn the tables on those naysayers. Despite so, she still turned over to assess Zu An after saying her piece, curious to know when this fellow had managed to hook up with other women outside.This won\u2019t do. My big sister isn\u2019t around these days, so I need to help her keep him in line. I can\u2019t let those whor\u2026 Chu Huanzhao looked at the innocent-looking Ji Xiaoxi, and she was unable to finish the word that went against her conscience.Everyone\u2019s expression slowly changed as they internalized all of the information they had received thus far. Earlier, they thought that Chu Huanzhao\u2019s claim that Zu An had taken 7 strikes from the Wailing Whip without crying out was an exaggeration, but with even Ji Xiaoxi testifying for him now, they started to wonder with Zu An was really some sort of incredible expert.It was also at this moment that Zu An walked up to Ye Chenliang and shook his head sympathetically, saying, \u201cAllow me to teach you a lesson too. The only reason why you think mooching is unreliable is due to you not being handsome enough. That\u2019s why you lack the imagination to fathom just how charming a man like me is. You can\u2019t even deal with either of the two women standing by my side right now, and you still dream of dueling me?\u201dChu Huanzhao: \u201c\u2026\u201dJi Xiaoxi: \u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone was dumbfounded. They were opening their eyes to a new height of shamelessness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayxzYou have successfully trolled Ye Chenliang for +999 Rage!Ye Chenliang had never felt so insulted before. He had confronted Zu An confidently in order to drag him down from his high horses, but who could have thought that it would all backfire on him?By this point, he had already dropped the idea of dueling Zu An. A person who could kill dozens of Assrip Wolves was definitely not someone he could deal with.\u201cYou\u2019re just a mere lower Ding class cultivator. Why are you feigning an expert here?\u201d It was then that a voice suddenly sounded out.Zu An narrowed his eyes. He could already see Hong Xingying amidst the crowd. Did I dig up his grave in his previous life? Why in the world is he biting onto me tenaciously like a mad dog?Those who had been present at the entrance earlier on also nodded in agreement. \u201cIndeed. His aptitude is only a mere lower Ding class!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s currently in the Yellow class right now, so how strong could he possibly be?\u201dYe Chenliang was feeling deeply conflicted by all of the information he was receiving. He didn\u2019t think that these people were lying, given that there were so many people testifying for it. But at the same time, it was unlikely for Ji Xiaoxi and Chu Huanzhao to be lying too. Just what in the world was happening here?He could have considered trying to further poke at the matter to uncover the truth, but to be honest, he was starting to get a little intimidated. He had utterly embarrassed himself earlier on, so if he were to make a wrong move here, he could very well lose his place in the academy.Meanwhile, Yuan Wendong noticed the look on Ye Chenliang\u2019s face, and he inwardly berated the latter for being utterly useless. It seems like I\u2019ll have to do it myself.So, Yuan Wendong stepped forward and clasped his fist toward Zu An. \u201cI was initially unwilling to get involved in this matter, but you were simply too overbearing. You have trampled over on the blood, sweat, and tears of the cultivators who have worked diligently to reach their current level. What we have right now didn\u2019t come just by coincidence. On the other hand, you chose to walk down a twisted path. If I allow you to get away with this, I cannot imagine just how many juniors will be misled by your example and lose their way to degeneracy. So, I, Yuan Wendong, representing all of the hardworking cultivators of the academy, will challenge you to a duel.\u201dAfter hearing Hong Xingying mention that Zu An was only a lower Ding class cultivator, he was already feeling quite confident about this matter. Besides, even if Zu An was just acting weak, he still didn\u2019t think that he would lose.One must know that his cultivation wasn\u2019t at the peak of the fourth rank, unlike what most people believed him to be. Just two days ago, he managed to make a breakthrough to the fifth rank. Currently, in the entire school, there were only so few people who had reached the fifth rank. Other than those few fearsome monsters, he was confident that he wouldn\u2019t lose to anyone.Besides, Zu An had just built up the stage for him, making him the perfect stepping stone for him to elevate his reputation one step further. The Yuan clan and the Chu clan were currently fighting one another over the arms trade anyway, so Zu An would be the perfect cannon fodder to sully the reputation of the Chu clan.Yuan Wendong\u2019s monologue about diligence and whatnot won him the goodwill of the crowd. There was a lingering sentiment of envy and resentment toward Zu An\u2019s reliance on women, so most people were just overjoyed to see that someone was willing to step forward to deal with him. Just this drama would be enough to satisfy their hunger for the day.\u201cYou speak as if you\u2019re the only one working hard. Do you know how hard I have worked too?\u201d Zu An exclaimed indignantly.Yuan Wendong was surprised. \u201cWhat have you worked hard on?\u201d\u201cI worked hard on my mooching skills! Do you think that it\u2019s that easy to be a mooch?\u201d Zu An argued vehemently.The men all around finally couldn\u2019t take it any longer.\u201cShit! This is too much. I really want to beat him up!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cShall we just do it together?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have Yuan Wendong have a go first.\u201d\u2026A beautiful figure, who happened to be passing by the area, heard Zu An\u2019s words and burst into laughter. He sure is shameless. I really wonder how in the world he managed to catch Chuyan\u2019s eyes.She was uninterested in such a minor scuffle, so she walked away without any hesitation.It was then that Yuan Wendong sneered coldly, \u201cMooching? How meaningless. Do you really expect to count on women for the rest of your life? Take a look at your current circumstances. Who are you going to count on to get you through this quandary? Chu Huanzhao? Or Ji Xiaoxi? Even the two of them combined won\u2019t be a match for me. In the end, men should rely on themselves. That\u2019s what true strength is!\u201dZu An sighed deeply. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would suffer from a lack of imagination too. Why do you think that I can\u2019t rely on a woman to get me through this crisis? Pei Mianman! Come here and help me deal with this hateful fellow!\u201dPei Mianman?That name made everyone freeze on the spot. That was the name of a beauty whose reputation in the academy was on par with Chu Chuyan! On top of that, while Chu Chuyan had a cold demeanor that distanced herself from others, Pei Mianman had an alluring figure and a gentle smile that posed a fatal charm toward men. There were no men who didn\u2019t fancy her.Was it even possible for such a goddess to be involved with this shameless fellow?Impossible. That was the first thought in everyone\u2019s mind.As expected, there was no response even after Zu An\u2019s shout. The crowd began jeering at him.Yuan Wendong also burst into laughter. \u201cDo you know who Pei Mianman is? How could someone like her possibly be interested in you? You\u2019re a toad lusting for the flesh of a swan!\u201dHe had once been entranced by that woman too, and he did everything he could to court her. However, he soon discovered that that woman was utterly cold on the inside despite her gentle exterior. She viewed all men to be nothing at all, which made her an even more difficult target to court than Chu Chuyan.How could such a woman possibly be involved with the shameless man standing before him?\u201cI saw you just now. If you leave right now, I\u2019m going to divulge everything that happened between us right here!\u201d Zu An shouted out loud.The figure who was attempting to sneak away a moment ago immediately froze up. Zu An\u2019s threat triggered her, and she shouted, \u201cShut up!\u201dFollowing that, everyone saw a young woman dressed in a red top and a black skirt walking over hurriedly. Her skin that was smooth like jade, her shapely oval eyes, her enchanting peach blossom eyes that seemed to speak, and her proud figure; all of these made men feel numb all over and women shy away in embarrassment of their own form.The usually gentle Pei Mianman had a darkened face on at this very moment. She glared at Zu An furiously as she spoke, \u201cIf you dare speak a word about that, I\u2019ll kill you right away!\u201dEveryone was still harboring some suspicions about the matter, but Pei Mianman\u2019s words seemed to verify their doubts. The hearts of countless men shattered in unison.To think that it\u2019s real! Our dream lover has actually gotten into that kind of relationship with this shameless man!Meanwhile, Zu An was feeling a little perplexed. He realized that the Rage points he was obtaining was only half of what he reaped earlier. What\u2019s going on? Is Pei Mianman\u2019s chest not big enough, or her face not beautiful enough?I thought that her being the secret guest of this show would push the income of Rage points to greater heights, but it\u2019s starting to show signs of slowing down instead\u2026The perplexed Zu An looked at the crowd, only to see that the angered faces of the men around had been replaced with envy\u2026 as well as respect.Even Suo Wei, who had run as far away as he could a moment ago, had returned and was grabbing onto his sleeves with sparkling eyes. \u201cBig bro, you\u2019ll be my only big bro for the rest of my\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, the crowd swarming in had already stomped down on him. \u201cMaster, take me in as your disciple!\u201d\u201cMaster, choose me. I wish to inherit your art of mooching, and I believe that I have the qualifications too!\u201d\u201cHah, I\u2019m the one who looks more like him! If anyone is going to inherit master\u2019s mooching legend, it\u2019s me!\u201d\u201cHeh, you\u2019re already thinking of overthrowing your master despite having yet to be accepted? Master, you mustn\u2019t take in that sort of backstabbing bastard as your disciple!\u201d\u2026Zu An could only lament at how outstanding he was. Even if what the keyboard accepted wasn\u2019t Rage points but Respect points, he would still have been able to rise to the top of the world.Meanwhile, Pei Mianman\u2019s eyelids were twitching uncontrollably. She gritted her teeth so tightly together that one could hear gnashing sounds coming from her closed lips. \u201cYou must be feeling very gleeful now, hm?\u201dZu An waved his hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not reminisce about the past now. Help me get rid of those two fellows\u2026 Ah no, throw that damned traitor over there into the mix too.\u201d He pointed to Hong Xingying, who was hiding amidst the crowd.In truth, Zu An was also feeling trepidation at the moment. He wasn\u2019t sure whether this woman would be willing to help him or not. If she were to turn against him instead, he would have no choice but to try summoning his final trump card, the beautiful principal.Pei Mianman was still glaring at Zu An furiously a moment ago, but for some reason, a tender smile suddenly surfaced on her lips, and she replied, \u201cAlright.\u201dThen, she pointed to Yuan Wendong, Ye Chenliang, and Hong Xingying, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s duel. The three of you can come at me together.\u201dThe faces of the trio immediately warped in horror. Yuan Wendong hurriedly spoke up, \u201cMiss Pei, we are\u2026\u201dPei Mianman interjected with a cold smile, \u201cI thought you mentioned something along the lines of what a man should rely on his own strength. Yet, the three of you are now afraid to accept a challenge from me? If you\u2019re afraid, kneel down and kowtow to Zu An, and I\u2019ll treat as if nothing happened today.\u201dHong Xingying immediately erupted in anger. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll accept your duel then! Who\u2019s afraid of\u2026\u201d Before he could even finish his sentence, a black silhouette flitted forth and sunk a fist right into his abdomen. Hong Xingying immediately collapsed to the ground, his body curled up like a prawn as he gasped desperately for breath.Pei Mianman blew on her own fist casually. \u201cA cultivation who hasn\u2019t even reached the fourth rank. I sure wonder where you got your confidence from. The two over there, it\u2019s your turn.\u201dYuan Wendong\u2019s face turned pale as he internally berated Hong Xingying for being a braindead fool. He knew the whole academy was looking at them right now, and it would be a huge humiliation if he were to coward out of this fight. \u201cPei Mianman, you better not go too far. You should know that I\u2019ve reached the fifth rank too!\u201dAs he said those words, golden light began to shine from his hands as numerous swords flew out from the sheaths of the surrounding onlookers to revolve around him. It was quite an imposing sight.\u201cThat fellow has reached the fifth rank? I thought that he was still at the peak of the fourth rank!\u201d\u201cHe sure hid it well! I wonder who he is trying to scheme against by concealing his strength. It\u2019s lucky that he was forced to reveal it today.\u201d\u201cHeh, looks like we\u2019ll have a good show to watch. Who do you think will win?\u201d\u201cDo you even need to ask? It\u2019s our goddess, of course!\u201d\u201cThat might not necessarily be the case. Ye Chenliang is not weakling either. In a 2 against 1 fight, I reckon that even Miss Pei will be put in a tight spot.\u201d\u2026Hearing the discussions from the crowd, Ye Chenliang began driving his ki to form a transparent layer around his body that resembled a tortoiseshell.Zu An was astounded to see this sight, Ye Chenliang was manifesting his ki as an armor around his body, which revealed his strength as a cultivator who had reached the peak of the third rank. Meanwhile, judging from how Yuan Wendong was attracting metal to him, similar to a certain helmeted fellow in his previous life. It appeared that his elemental attribute was metal.Zu An felt that he didn\u2019t stand a chance against either of the two of them, though if he used the Grandgale\u2019s instantaneous movement together with Poisonous Prick, he could still stand a chance.Yuan Wendong knew that the one to make the first move controlled the flow of the battle, so he immediately sent the dozens of swords revolving around him toward Pei Mianman with a grand wave of his hand. At the same time, Ye Chenliang also charged forward like a bull right behind those swords to ram down the beautiful silhouette standing before him.Even someone as fearless as Zu An couldn\u2019t help but worry in Pei Mianman\u2019s place. The latter, however, appeared to be completely unfazed. A burst of black flames rose from her feet and soared up around her like a divine dragon. All of the swords that came into contact with the balck flames vanished one after another at an astounding speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the black flame was able to even melt metal, what chance would a body made out of flesh and blood stand against it?He had never expected Yuan Wendong\u2019s swords to be so useless. At least a rock would still cause a splash when dropped into a pool of water, but all of these swords disappeared without achieving anything at all.By the time Ye Chenliang finally came to, it was already too late for him to stop anymore. He could only watch in despair as his body headed straight for destruction.It was then that the middle-aged man with a bald spot on his head suddenly appeared between the two of them. This middle-aged man placed his hand on Ye Chenliang\u2019s head and stopped his charge.\u201cA mere third rank actually attempted to ram down a fifth rank. What have you been learning in the academy all of these years?\u201d the middle-aged man bellowed furiously. Following that, he turned to Pei Mianman and glared at her. \u201cYou too. Do you need to be so vicious against your fellow schoolmate?\u201dPei Mianman reined in her black flame as she remarked, \u201cAll I did was to stand here. What can I do if he so fervently wishes to charge in and court his own death?\u201d After saying those words, she turned her head away from this widely-feared discipline master and walked away.The crowd, who had just witnessed her strength, quickly opened up a path for her to pass through.Meanwhile, Zu An was a little taken aback by Pei Mianman\u2019s strength too.It\u2019s fortunate that Pei Mianman didn\u2019t use her elemental powers yesterday, or else I would have ended up being vaporized like those swords! No matter how the Heiress Ball of Delights is, there\u2019s no way it can protect my life even after I\u2019ve been burned into ashes.The discipline master, Lu De, watched Pei Mianman departing without saying a word. However, by the time he turned to look at Ye Chenliang, he already had a different face on, \u201cAre you the one causing a fuss here?\u201dYe Chenliang\u2019s soul almost escaped from his body in this instant. He hurriedly pointed to Zu An and exclaimed, \u201cTeacher, it wasn\u2019t me! He was the one causing trouble!\u201dLu De turned to Zu An and asked coldly, \u201cYou were the one causing trouble here?\u201dZu An shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cI stood here without making a move from the start to the end. They are the ones who insistently tried to provoke me one after another, wanting me to duel them. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask the other students around.\u201dThe crowd quickly verified Zu An\u2019s words. They might have looked down on Zu An for relying on women previously, but after seeing how he was able to mooch off women to such an unbelievable level, getting involved with four out of the Ten Great Beauties of the Sweetheart Ranking\u2014not to mention that the two of them were even the top two, Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman\u2014the only feelings that they had left for him were respect and admiration. If they could just learn a thing or two from this master, they would be set for life.Zu An would have never imagined that even decades later, the legend of the \u2018Moochlord\u2019 would continue to be passed down through each generation of students. There were even a group of people who revered him so greatly that they couldn\u2019t bear to call him by his name, opting to use \u2018The Man\u2019 instead as a show of respect.Seeing how the students were vouching for Zu An, Lu De\u2019s face turned chilly. He began striking Ye Chenliang with the ruler in his hand without any mercy. \u201cI\u2019ve long heard that you have been forming factions in the academy to bully the weak! Very well, let me show you what it means to reform a person through virtue today!\u201dThe ruler in the hands of the discipline master was far more formidable than Chu Huanzhao\u2019s \u2018Wailing Whip\u2019. Ye Chenliang was left shrieking in agony under the strikes. He felt incredibly wronged here. Yuan Wendong was the one who started the fight here, so why are you only hitting me?However, Ye Chenliang knew better than to voice those thoughts aloud. Yuan Wendong might look like a gentleman on the surface, but it was just a cover to conceal his viciousness. Now that the other party had reached the fifth rank, he definitely couldn\u2019t afford to offend him.After dealing with Ye Chenliang, Lu De turned his gaze toward Hong Xingying, who was lying on the ground. \u201cThe same goes for you too. It\u2019s only your first day at the academy, but you\u2019ve already gotten yourself into trouble. Do you think that I dare not to teach you a lesson just because you\u2019re from the Chu clan? I shall make sure to beat the academy rules into your bones today!\u201dHong Xingying nearly burst into tears.I was the one who suffered the most tragic plight earlier on, so why do I need to continue suffering now?It had only been a day since he arrived in the academy, so he wasn\u2019t clear about the politics going on here. Due to that, he ended up pointing his finger at Yuan Wendong and said, \u201cTeacher, why aren\u2019t you punishing him then?\u201dA cold glint flashed across Yuan Wendong\u2019s eyes.On the other hand, Lu De harrumphed coldly and responded, \u201cHe\u2019s reached fifth rank, but what about you? I can tell you frankly that the students who are able to reach the fifth rank are all top-notch talents of our country, and they\u2019ll be regarded as treasures no matter where they go. If any of you are able to reach the fifth rank in the future, as long as you don\u2019t go too far, the academy will basically turn a blind eye to whatever misdeed you do.\u201dZu An felt his heart skip a beat. It looked like strength was important no matter which world one was in. The students that had gathered around didn\u2019t appear to be surprised by Lu De\u2019s declaration, revealing that they had already known about these \u2018implicit rules\u2019 beforehand.After Lu De was done saying his piece, he dragged the two wailing fellows away with him, leaving the crowd praying for their safety.Wei Suo, who was hugging Zu An\u2019s thigh, gulped fearfully as he said, \u201cBoss, there was a moment there that I feared for your life when you talked back to him. Those who fell prey to Baldhead usually don\u2019t end very well.\u201dZu An chuckled in response. \u201cSince Lu De seeks to reform the students through virtue, it\u2019s only right for him to listen to the voice of reason.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re probably the only one who dares to reason with him.\u201d Xie Xiu laughed heartily as he walked over to Zu An. \u201cI thought that I am a man who has conquered many beautiful flowers, but it looks like I\u2019m still lacking compared to Brother Zu. I never thought that you would be able to win the hearts of four of the beauties in the Ten Great Beauties. I\u2019m humbled by your accomplishments. I hope that we can sit down together to trade our insights in the future.\u201d\u201cBrother Xie, you\u2019re flattering me. Don\u2019t you have one by your side too?\u201d Zu An answered.\u201cBy my side? Why am I not aware of it?\u201d Xie Xiu was taken aback. While there was no lack of beautiful women by his side, he didn\u2019t think that any of them had reached the level of the Ten Great Beauties.\u201cIsn\u2019t your sister one of the Ten Great Beauties? Brother Xie, it would be great if you could introduce her to us,\u201d Zu An replied.Xie Xiu nearly choked on his saliva. \u201cT-that\u2026 I still have matters to attend to, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d Completely ignoring Zu An\u2019s attempts to keep him, he left the area frantically without even turning his head around once.Zu An was dumbfounded. \u201cWhy does it look as if he has seen a ghost?\u201dOn the other hand, Wei Suo\u2019s reverence for Zu An only grew even deeper. \u201cBoss, you have my highest respect. Despite already having the four of them, you aren\u2019t content yet and still want to flirt with young master Xie\u2019s older sister. Truly unthinkable. There\u2019s none in our generation who can hope to compare to you!\u201d\u201cYou sure have a smooth tongue. You would have surely thrived in the corporate world.\u201d Zu An was a little disgusted by how Wei Suo was fawning on him, so he shoved him aside. He turned his attention to Ji Xiaoxi and said, \u201cMiss Ji, you have my earnest gratitude for the matter earlier on.\u201dBefore Ji Xiaoxi could respond, Chu Huanzhao had already butted in first, \u201cWhat do you mean by this? I was the one to help you first!\u201dJi Xiaoxi\u2019s face reddened. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, I\u2019m just doing what is right. I need to leave now.\u201dIt would appear that she was still uncomfortable from being in the center of attention here, so she began to jog away. However, barely after taking a few steps, she suddenly turend around and said, \u201cI nearly forgot. Do drop by my home when you have some time on hand. My father would like to talk with you.\u201d\u201cOooh~\u201dThe crowd looked at the two of them with a weird stare, which surprised Ji Xiaoxi. It was only then that she belatedly realized the innuendo hidden amidst her words, but she had no idea how she should start explaining the matter. In the end, she gave up and ran away with a furious blush on her cheeks.\u201cWhat the hell is that? How dare she seduce you in my presence?!\u201d Chu Huanzhao huffed angrily. The way her small chest was puffing in and out looked incredibly adorable.Zu An rolled her eyes at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you\u2019re my wife, so why are you interfering so much in my business?\u201dIt went without saying that he understood the true meaning behind Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s words. Most likely, it was regarding the trauma he was suffering from. It looked like he would have to make haste and quickly acquire some dudous. Perhaps, he might just be able to fool that old pervert, Ji Dengtu.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m just keeping an eye on you on my older sister\u2019s behalf!\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s cheeks puffed out indignantly. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since my older sister left, and you\u2019re already messing around with other women!\u201dZu An replied nonchalantly, \u201cYou can go ahead and ask your older sister if she needs you to keep an eye on me.\u201dThat wife of mine looks at me the same way a person would look at a stranger on the street. No, I might even be less than a stranger to her. Why should I keep my chastity for her then\u2026 Pui pui pui, what the hell am I talking about?\u201cHmph! Stop flirting around here.\u201d Yuan Wendong walked over with an awful look on his face. \u201cZu An, I don\u2019t believe that you can live your life hiding behind women. It won\u2019t be long before the Clans Tournament. By then, let\u2019s see if you can get a woman to substitute you on the ring!\u201dZu An was confused. He turned to Chu Huanzhao and asked, \u201cWhat Clans Tournament?\u201dChu Huanzhao was pouting unhappily, but she still answered his question, \u201cJust like our Chu clan, the Yuan clan is involved in the arm trade too, so there\u2019s rife competition going on between two of our clans. In order to avoid escalating the conflict, the two clans have decided to hold a tournament once between the juniors of both clans every three years. The winner will get to decide the market share for each sector that each clan gets for the next three years.\u201d\u201cDo I need to participate as well?\u201d Zu An asked.Chu Huanzhao nodded in response. \u201cEveryone in the clan needs to participate. The previous time around, it was my older sister and cousins from the second branch and third branch. Since you\u2019re the son-in-law of our Chu clan, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll have to step forward and represent us too.\u201dZu An felt a little stifled to hear this abrupt news.What the hell is this? I can\u2019t even enjoy the privileges of being the son-in-law of a prestigious clan, but I still need to fulfill my responsibilities?\u201cThen\u2026 is the Yuan clan a ducal clan too?\u201dChu Huanzhao shook her head in response. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. Their clan has a noble lineage too, but they are without a fief. In terms of position, they are far beneath my father.\u201dZu An couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t it embarrassing for a ducal clan to have to compete with minor powers to decide the market share through a duel?\u201dBefore Chu Huanzhao could answer the question, Yuan Wendong had already responded to the question with an awful look on his face, \u201cThe Brightmoon Duke has a high standing, but our Zhou Dynasty is a place ruled by laws. Besides, the Chu clan isn\u2019t the only one with a ducal lineage either.\u201dZu An nodded in realization. \u201cAh, I get what you\u2019re saying. In other words, you have someone backing you up. It\u2019s no wonder why you\u2019re barking so loudly, it turns out that you already have a master!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for +321 Rage!Looking at the academy staff walking around not too far away, Yuan Wendong took in a deep breath before saying, \u201cYou have nothing but your sharp mouth, so I shan\u2019t waste my time bickering with you. Just wait till the day of the tournament\u2026\u201dYuan Wendong leaned toward Zu An and whispered softly, \u201cI\u2019ll break your limbs and turn you into a cripple!\u201dZu An sighed deeply. \u201cI think you should first worry about how you are going to compensate for their swords.\u201dDue to Lu De\u2019s sudden appearance earlier, most of the crowd had already scattered. Nevertheless, there were still a dozen people standing there. They were staring at Yuan Wendong with hesitant looks on their faces, not moving a step at all.Earlier, Yuan Wendong had used their swords to attack Pei Mianman, only to have Pei Mianman burn their swords down to cinders with her black flame. They felt that Yuan Wendong should take responsibility for it and compensate them, but they were a little afraid to ask for it.However, with Zu An bringing up the issue once more, these people finally bucked up their courage and began shouting out loud.\u201cCompensate us our swords!\u201d\u201cI spent a lot of money to purchase that sword of mine!\u201d\u201cMy sword is the work of Master XX, and it\u2019s known to be able to slice through metal like mud\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My clan dabbles in arms, so why would I shirk compensation for those lousy swords of yours?\u201dIt took him a great deal of effort before he managed to placate the riled crowd. By the time he was free to turn his attention to Zu An once more, the latter had already disappeared from the scene.You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for +123 Rage!Zu An had been dragged by Chu Huanzhao over to the canteen. He took a look at the design of the canteen, and he was amused to see that it was pretty similar to the canteen in the universities of his previous life too. The only difference was that there was no need for them to get the food by themselves. Instead, there were people to receive their orders.\u201cI\u2019ll treat you, so feel free to order anything you want!\u201d Chu Huanzhao tossed the menu toward him as she declared generously like a rich woman.Wei Suo, who was chased to another table by her, raised his thumbs up toward Zu An. He felt that this new big brother of his was really the role model of all moochers in the world.Yup, mooching is indeed the way to make it in the world. I should learn from big brother and find a sugar momma to live off. Oof, but Principal Jiang is way too off my league. I should find someone easier first\u2026Meanwhile, Zu An didn\u2019t even bother to look at the menu as he turned to the waiter by the side and said, \u201cGive me one of everything then.\u201dHe was quite curious about the food in this world, and there was lots of stuff on the menu that he was pretty curious about. To be honest, he didn\u2019t recognize most of those dishes, so it would be good if he could give everything a try.You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +99 Rage!\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d Chu Huanzhao quickly told the waiter before shooting Zu An a sharp glare. \u201cAre you a pig? Are you sure you can finish all of it?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d Zu An shrugged leisurely. \u201cHowever, I can just have a mouthful of each of them. As you know, I came from a poor family and haven\u2019t eaten many things before. Since someone is treating me today, it goes without saying that I\u2019ll have to try everything I can.\u201dChu Huanzhao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll only allow you to order 10\u2026 No, just 8 dishes!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Zu An asked.To be honest, he was rather impressed. He thought that the 4 dishes would already be enough for the two of them to have their fill, especially considering the fact that this young lass is rather small in size. Yet, who could have thought that she would ask for 8 dishes.It looks like nobles really lived their lives extravagantly. I must learn from their example\u2026 Ahem, I mean admonish them thoroughly!Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face reddened. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have that much money.\u201dZu An shook his head in disdain. \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have told me to order whatever I like. Why boast when you don\u2019t have the capability to back up your words?\u201dIn the end, Chu Huanzhao was unable to hold her temper back anymore. She slammed her palm on the table and shot to her feet, roaring, \u201cDamn you Zu An, are you going to eat or not?!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +666 Rage!\u201cI\u2019m eating. Why would I not eat?\u201d Zu An glanced at the dumbfounded waiter by the side as he spoke. \u201cBring me 8 of the most expensive dishes you have here then.\u201d\u201cNo problem~\u201d The waiter shot a glance at Chu Huanzhao to seek her approval, but seeing the latter didn\u2019t oppose it, he quickly ran off to process their order.Meanwhile, a group of guys seated not too far away gossiped\u2026\u201cDo you see that? Mooching is not as glorious as we see. In the end, he needs to tread carefully around those he\u2019s mooching off. If things go badly, he would just become a cannon fodder for them to blow off steam!\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look like it though. It looks like it\u2019s his sugar momma who is treading carefully around him.\u201d\u201cTsk! Who cares about who is the one treading carefully around who? If I could get such a beautiful sugar momma too, I wouldn\u2019t mind even if I need to be at her beck and call!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cThe lot of you are too unambitious\u2026 though I\u2019d be willing too.\u201d\u201cTsk~\u201dBack to Zu An\u2019s side, Chu Huanzhao stared at Zu An with glowering eyes as she interrogated, \u201cZu An, you better come clean. How did you get yourself tangled up with those women?\u201dZu An knocked the table and complained, \u201cHey hey hey, watch how you address me! Call me brother-in-law!\u201dChu Huanzhao nearly choked again after hearing those words. Her chubby cheeks puffed up once more as she grumbled in displeasure, \u201cAre you going to continue harping on that? I did lose to you in a bet, but I\u2019ve already called you brother-in-law for so long now. I even stepped forward for you today. No matter how we look at it, I\u2019ve already repaid the favor!\u201dZu An clicked his tongue. \u201cWhen you said that you would cover me, I thought that you were doing well in the academy. Yet, it turns out that you can\u2019t even deal with a mere scrub. In the end, I still have to make a move myself!\u201dChu Huanzhao was rendered speechless. \u201cYou call that making a move yourself? You simply got a bunch of women to stand up for you!\u201d\u201cDoes that make any difference?\u201d Zu An shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cI relied on my own ability to get their help.\u201dAll those twists and turns in logic really confused Chu Huanzhao. In the end, she waved her hands impatiently and said, \u201cEnough! Hurry up and confess! How did you hook up with them?\u201dZu An frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean by hook up? You\u2019re a maiden! Can you not use such awful sounding words?\u201dChu Huanzhao\u2019s face scrunched in disdain. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you had such a delicate side. Disgusting.\u201dZu An: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to teach you something over here. A girl shouldn\u2019t mald at everything like a fuse always on the verge of blowing up. If you can just mellow down a little and use some cutesy phrases, you wouldn\u2019t be ranked in the ninth place in the Ten Great Beauties.\u201d\u201cHah, do I need you to teach me that? I can do it if I want to,\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed coldly.Zu An\u2019s interest was piqued. \u201cOh? Why don\u2019t you give it a try then?\u201d\u201cStop messing around!\u201c Chu Huanzhao rolled her eyes before pouring herself a cup of tea. She casually raised her leg and placed it on the bench beside her. Her leg was beautiful, but her posture not so much. Nevertheless, with her neat, shoulder-length hair, she gave off a unique feral charm.Seeing how naturally she got into this sitting posture, Zu An scrapped all ideas of getting her to be more demure.\u201cAfter prattling about so much, you still haven\u2019t told me how you met them!\u201d Chu Huanzhao continued questioning relentlessly.Zu An knew that she would continue annoying him if he didn\u2019t answer this question, so he decided to just answer her casually, \u201cI met Ji Xiaoxi earlier when I was looking around the city. As for Pei Mianman, isn\u2019t she your older sister\u2019s close friend? It\u2019s only natural for her to step in when the husband of her close friend is being taken advantage of, no?\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201d Chu Huanzhao narrowed her eyes in skepticism.\u201cWhat else do you think?\u201dBy then, the waiter had already begun serving the dishes. The fragrance coming from the dishes whetted Zu An\u2019s appetite, such that he immediately began digging in.Chu Huanzhao, on the other hand, was still a little caught up with the matter. \u201cThat\u2019s not right. No matter how I look at it, your relationship isn\u2019t that simple. Besides, I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. Everyone is saying the same too!\u201dZu An wolfed down the food as he answered her query, \u201cThose people also see you as a part of my harem. What do you think?\u201d\u201cHah! Just thinking about that maddens me!\u201d Chu Huanzhao gritted her teeth furiously. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201dZu An burst into laughter. \u201cAren\u2019t I your brother-in-law? It\u2019s only natural to keep good stuff within the family.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyebrows shot up.Zu An immediately waved his hand sheepishly. \u201cI mean that we\u2019re one family, so we should help one another when in need.\u201d\u201cAre you sure there\u2019s nothing more between you and those women?\u201d Chu Huanzhao continued probing on doubtfully.\u201cOf course not.\u201d Zu An wouldn\u2019t admit it even if he had a relationship with them, though he really didn\u2019t have anything more going on with them.It was only then that Chu Huanzhao heaved a deep sigh of relief. By the time her attention returned to the table, half of the dishes served had already been swept clean. She immediately reached for her chopsticks in agitation as she exclaimed, \u201cAre you a pig? Leave some for me!\u201dZu An was a little surprised. \u201cAs the young miss of a ducal clan, surely you have already had your fill of such dishes?\u201dChu Huanzhao stuffed her cheeks full as she answered, \u201cMy mother is very strict on me. She barely gives me any pocket money, and these dishes are expensive. I can\u2019t bear to spend my money on them on normal occasions.\u201d\u201cAww, how pitiful. Come, you should have more.\u201d Zu An picked up a piece of meat and placed it into her bowl out of sympathy.\u201cThanks, brother-in-law.\u201d Right after Chu Huanzhao said those words, she suddenly frowned. Wiat, I\u2019m the one spending money here. Why am I thanking you for that?\u201cStop putting food in my bowl. You\u2019re getting your saliva on my food!\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s reducing your appetite at all though?\u201d\u2026After the two of them had their fill, Zu An suddenly asked, \u201cHuanzhao, what do you think of me?\u201dChu Huanzhao was surprised for a moment before answering subconsciously, \u201cEven though you\u2019re a little hateful, a little perverted, and a little weak, you\u2019re still barely passable as a human.\u201dZu An rolled his eyes. Are you praising me or criticizing me here? \u201cThen, who do you think in the manor doesn\u2019t want me to become your brother-in-law?\u201dChu Huanzhao had a straightforward personality, so it would be good if he could get any intelligence from her so as to figure out who in the world was out for his life.Chu Huanzhao burst into laughter, amused by the question. \u201cThere are way too many people to name!\u201dZu An held back his urge to pummel her and said, \u201cI\u2019m referring to those who hate me to the point that they are out for my life.\u201dChu Huanzhao fell into deep thoughts. Just as Zu An thought that she had thought of a certain someone, she suddenly said, \u201cThere are still a lot of people\u2026\u201dZu An was dumbfounded. It was unlikely this silly lass was lying, which only showed how hateful the original owner of the body was. To think that there would be so many people in the Chu clan who were out for his life!\u201cWhat about your older sister then?\u201d Zu An looked into Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes unblinkingly, seemingly trying to peer through her eyes to see into her thoughts.Even though he didn\u2019t think that Chu Chuyan was out for his life, there was still no denying that Snow was her personal maidservant. Without her permission, it was unlikely that Snow would dare to act so audaciously.\u201cMy older sister?\u201d Chu Huanzhao was confused. \u201cWhy would she want to take your life?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that there are a lot of people in the manor who are out for my life? Isn\u2019t your older sister one of them too?\u201d Zu An asked.Chu Huanzhao shook her head and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re the groom personally chosen by my older sister. You should know that my parents have selected a long list of outstanding young men for my older sister to choose from, but she didn\u2019t even spare them a single glance. In the end, she chose a wastr\u2026 Cough cough, I mean a man like you. There were many people who tried to stop her, saying that she was ruining her own future. Yet, she said that she would marry no one other than you. Even to this day, I\u2019ve no idea what in the world does she see in you.\u201dShe assessed Zu An from head to toe with a look of contempt on her face as she said those words.\u201cHey hey hey, you\u2019re hurting my feelings over here!\u201dZu An fell into deep thoughts. He had heard about this from Cheng Shouping previously, and Chu Huanzhao only further reaffirmed the matter. From the current looks of it, it would appear that the only one in the manor who was impossible to be the culprit was Chu Chuyan.All of a sudden, his eyes fell upon the lass, who wolfing down her food before him, and he swallowed his words back in. No, that\u2019s not right. The one who is the most unlikely to kill me in the manor is this lass, followed by Chu Chuyan.\u201cWhat is your older sister dealing with nowadays?\u201d Zu An asked.\u201cNo idea,\u201d Chu Huanzhao replied as she continued relishing in the delicacies before her.Zu An frowned in annoyance. \u201cYou\u2019re her younger sister, why wouldn\u2019t you know?\u201dChu Huanzhao unhesitatingly rebutted those words, \u201cAnd you\u2019re her husband, so why don\u2019t you know a thing at all?! I\u2019m not engaged with whatever that\u2019s happening back at home.\u201d\u201cEat eat eat, all you know is to eat. Despite being a glutton, it doesn\u2019t look like your chest is growing at all.\u201d Zu An looked at her flat chest as he wondered: They are born from the same mother, so why is there such a huge difference between the two of them?\u201cHold it right there. What do you mean?\u201d Chu Huanzhao had only just finished eating when she noticed his gaze, and she immediately flew into a state of fury.You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +666 Rage!Zu An was amused. He didn\u2019t expect her to be so sensitive about her own chests. That being said, he didn\u2019t want to anger her at this moment, so he said, \u201cI\u2019m saying that you should pay some heed to your own appearance. You should at least wipe your mouth after eating.\u201dAs he spoke, he reached out to pick off a grain of rice sticking to the corner of her lips.His action caused Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face to turn furiously red. \u201cHey, haven\u2019t you heard that it\u2019s inappropriate for a man and a woman to have intimate contact? You can\u2019t possibly be carrying that sort of licentious thoughts toward me, are you?\u201dZu An clicked his tongue in annoyance. \u201cIt\u2019s only at a time like this that you think of yourself as a woman, huh?\u201dChu Huanzhao was stunned for a moment before nodding in confusion, \u201cThat\u2019s true too.\u201d From her tone, it seemed like she had given up on thinking anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s going to be afternoon classes soon, so I\u2019ll be heading back first,\u201d said Chu Huanzhao.There was hardly anyone left in the canteen at this point. She casually wiped her mouth before rising to her feet.\u201cWhat class are you in?\u201d Zu An asked out of curiosity.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Oddly enough, Chu Huanzhao suddenly began fidgeting uncomfortably. Her voice also became a little weaker. \u201cI\u2019m from the Black class.\u201cLaugh if you want to. My older sister was a prodigy in the Sky class, reputed to be the strongest amongst the students, whereas I\u2019m nowhere near in comparison to her. I have been mocked many times in the past, so I can\u2019t be bothered with it anymore.\u201dYet, who could have thought that Zu An would pat her shoulders and said, \u201cYou must have had a hard time, huh? You don\u2019t need to worry anymore, I\u2019m here to lower the bars. I\u2019m from the Yellow class, remember?\u201dHe could remember how everyone seemed to carry ill will toward him when he first arrived in this world. This lass was the only one who stood forward for him when everyone in the ancestral hall was trying to get him punished. Seeing how downcast she was upon mentioning this matter, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to make a jab at her.Chu Huanzhao was taken aback by his remark. She stared at him deeply for a moment before muttering softly, \u201cThank you.\u201dZu An continued consoling, \u201cEveryone has their own strengths. Perhaps your strength just doesn\u2019t lie in cultivation.\u201dA slight misty layer cloaked Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes as she looked at him, touched by his words. \u201cWhat do you think my strength is then?\u201dZu An was rendered speechless by that question.I was just comforting you. I didn\u2019t expect you to take it for real!Nevertheless, faced with Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes of anticipation, there was no way he could bring himself to say that she had no strengths at all, right?However, the two of them had only known each other for a short period of time, and no matter how Zu An thought about it, he was unable to figure out her strengths. It took him a long while before he finally squeezed out an answer, \u201cYour legs\u2026 are long?\u201dAs ridiculous as it might sound, it was actually his honest thought. Even right now, he could still remember that pair of slim and well-proportionate legs shaking around while she was seated on a table that night. Those were a good pair of legs that could easily walk into the heart of any man.It was no wonder why people said that those who tended to be lacking in the chest area were compensated by their legs.On the other hand, Chu Huanzhao hadn\u2019t expected to receive such an answer, and she spat, \u201cPui, you pervert!\u201dThen, she quickly ran away with a reddened face.Zu An stared at her departing back with a stifled look on his face.What\u2019s the point of just scolding me like this? Where is your Rage points? Why didn\u2019t I receive anything at all? This is unfair!Meanwhile, Wei Suo walked over fawningly and said, \u201cBoss, I find myself more and more in awe with you. I reckon that you are the only one in the academy who can make the tomboyish Second Miss Chu reveal such an embarrassed expression.\u201d\u201cOf course. Who do you think you are talking to?\u201d Zu An replied gleefully. \u201cAh right, what classes do we have in the afternoon?\u201dHe was still thinking of escaping from the academy once he was done with lunch, but he unexpectedly received a huge wave of Rage points. That changed his mind about the academy, and he suddenly felt that things were not that bad here after all.\u201cI think it\u2019s an etiquette and music class,\u201d replied Wei Suo.\u201cEtiquette and music?\u201d Zu An\u2019s eyes lit up.From elementary school all the way till university, he noticed that there was a common pattern\u2014the Music Department always had the most beautiful female teacher. Be it their refined disposition or their graceful profile, it was hard to pick a flaw in them. Now that he was in a world filled with ki, the music teachers should be even more beautiful, right?Zu An had never looked forward to a class that much before. He quickly returned back to the classroom, only to see that fatty Man Yu chatting loudly with his sidekicks. However, their group quickly fell silent upon noticing Zu An\u2019s presence.They had no choice but to lie low for the time being. They were no match for Zu An, and their backing wasn\u2019t as strong as the latter\u2019s too. Thinking about it now, Ye Chenliang was probably still getting ravaged by Lu De at the field at this very moment.That Baldhead was really a pervert. Anyone who got caught by him would suffer an experience they would never forget.On the other hand, Zu An couldn\u2019t be bothered to give a damn about them. He looked at the doorway of the classroom as he waited excitedly for the beautiful teacher who would soon walk in.However, when the one who walked in turned out to be a trembling old man, he suddenly saw all of his dreams shatter right before his eyes.Where are the promised refined disposition and graceful profile? At the very least, I should get a female teacher, right? Why in the world did I get an old man?!\u201cCough cough. Open your textbooks, we shall be starting a new chapter today\u2014Rules of Propriety.\u201cValues and morals are meaningless if not based on propriety. Reforming the society and improving the culture will be for naught if propriety is absent. Distinguishing between right and wrong will be impossible if propriety is not put in place.\u201cA liege and his subject, a father and his son; how could these ties be established if propriety is not upheld? A teacher and a student; how can a conducive relationship for the inheritance of knowledge be constructed if there\u2019s a lack of propriety to dictate the relationship? A military commander and his soldiers; how should authority be maintained if propriety is neglected? Rites to worship the deities and the deceased; how could sincerity be conveyed if rituals were to lack propriety?\u201cThus, men should learn respect, humility, and concession to uphold propriety. Parrots are capable of speech, yet mere birds they are. Apes are capable of speech, yet mere beasts they are. If humans lack propriety, even if they are capable of speech, what is there to differentiate them from mere beasts? It\u2019s the lack of propriety that fathers and sons share a woman.\u201cThus we have sages who determine propriety and educate the people. It\u2019s the existence of propriety that humans know to set themselves apart from beasts\u2026\u201d\u2026Save me!Zu An was utterly despaired. Not only was there not the promised beautiful music teacher, but he even had to go through the torture of listening to the teacher\u2019s chanting. This was even worse than being in prison!He took a look out of the window as he wondered if he could escape from this classroom if he were to use Grandgale\u2019s ability. However, considering how Wei Suo had mentioned that the teachers in the academy were all experts, he felt that the likelihood was very low.Putting everything aside, that vile Baldhead Lu de was still in the field at the moment. If he were to escape right now, he could just fall right into that evil man\u2019s grasp.Besides, it was simply not worth revealing his trump card in public over such a minor reason.So, Zu An could only dispel those thoughts.That being said, there was no way he was going to earnestly listen to the lessons. It was not as if these preachings would help him in life anyway even if he could understand them.So, he decided to secretly do his own personal work in class, similar to how he secretly played mobile games under his desk in his previous life. He summoned the keyboard out before turning warily toward Wei Suo to ask, \u201cDo you see anything here?\u201dWei Suo was bewildered by Zu An\u2019s abrupt question, and he replied subconsciously, \u201cI see your hairsome face.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s handsome, not hairsome,\u201dBlack streaks filled Zu An\u2019s face. I know that he has buck teeth, but he really needs to work on his pronunciation.But in any case, after confirming that no one could see his keyboard, he heaved a sigh of relief.Let me see how many Rage points I have. Hm?Zu An rubbed his eyes in disbelief. To his astonishment, he actually had 57,454 Rage points in total! That was more than the grand total he had earned thus far!He quickly recalled what he had done for the day, and it would seem that he had earned quite a bit earlier in the morning at the academy gates, as well as bits and pieces over the day too. Of course, the bulk of it came from the main show earlier in the afternoon with Ye Chenliang, Yuan Wendong and the others. The crowd was simply too kind that they kept offering him their Rage enthusiastically.This newly-gathered data compelled Zu An to rethink his strategy. No matter how he tried to squeeze an individual dry, the amount of Rage points he could earn from an individual was still severely limited. It would be much wiser for him to spread his net out and earn it from a crowd instead. That would be far more efficient.Yeap, it looks like I should focus more on AOE skills in the future. The more butthurt people there are, the better it would be for me.After deciding on his new plan, Zu An moved on to look at the keyboard\u2019s lottery. However, he soon realized that he wasn\u2019t in a good position to do his usual hand washing ritual.Forget it, I\u2019ll just compromise a little.Zu An wanted to forsake the hassle and simply press the enter button and get the lottery done and over with, but his trembling hands simply wouldn\u2019t heed his orders.No, I can\u2019t skip any step at all. Even if I don\u2019t wash my face, the least I should do is to wash my hands so as to cleanse my luck!So, he spat in his hand and rubbed it all over before finally hitting the enter button at ease.The light marker swiftly flashed across the keyboard before finally stopping at the number \u20184\u2019. Ki Fruit!Zu An was delighted.It looks like washing my hands is really important. I actually got it in a single shot!Meanwhile, his deskmate, Wei Suo, watched as he spat saliva onto his own hands and froze on the spot. Wei Suo quickly shifted his chair discreetly away from him, wanting to keep a distance away.I know that my boss is a master pimper, but I didn\u2019t think that he would have such horrid hygiene practices. I wonder if my Chu Chuyan and the others know that he does such stuff.Zu An had completely no idea how bizarre his actions were in the eyes of others. He was too focused on the lottery at the very moment.Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!\u201cShit, yet another wave of \u2018Thanks for playing\u2019!\u201d\u2026Oh, another Ki Fruit.\u2026Thanks for playing\u2026 Ki Fruit\u2026 Thanks for playing\u2026 Ki Fruit\u2026Zu An continued drawing for over a hundred times, and the light marker finally landed on a key that was different from before\u2014 number \u20181\u2019. It was Faith in Brother Spring!Zu An heaved a sigh of relief. In truth, he had really wanted to draw this. The last time he got injured, he used Divine Physician Ji\u2019s medicine, but the rate of recovery was less than satisfactory. Were he to be in a dire situation, there was no way his enemy would wait for him to heal up before continuing their assault!With Faith in Brother Spring around, he would at least have another trump card in hand. The ability to instantly restore himself back to full health was almost the same as having an additional life.Zu An continued drawing the lottery, hoping to get something different. After all, the products from the keyboard tended to be high in quality. However, it would appear that fate wasn\u2019t on his side. All he got afterward was just \u2018Thanks for playing\u2019 and Ki Fruits.Damn it, I don\u2019t believe that my luck would really be that bad!So, Zu An spat another mouthful of saliva on his own hands and rubbed them thoroughly between his fingers and into his fingernails before resuming the drawing once more. It was fortunate that he had 50,000 Rage points this time around, so he could draw a total of 574 times.Meanwhile, Wei Suo gulped a mouthful of saliva as he wondered if his boss was out of his mind.No, I shouldn\u2019t harbor such thoughts. Boss is the man known as the master pimper! How can I dare evaluate him using common logic? Could this be his secret to how he managed to court so many beautiful women? I must learn from his example!So, Wei Suo also spat in his hand and began rubbing his saliva all around. He couldn\u2019t resist the urge to raise his hands up and smell them, and the sheer stench was so powerful that it nearly knocked him out.Moving back to Zu An, a wide smile of excitement had broken out of his face once more. The light marker had landed on a different number this time around\u2014number \u20189\u2019!Fortune Pill!Artifact Effect: Maximizes your luck to the greatest degree for two hours. Any event or trial that is luck dependent will end in an outcome favorable to you.Zu An\u2019s eyes lit up. This was exactly the thing he needed right now! With this, wouldn\u2019t he be able to draw something useful on the keyboard every single time?Perhaps it was because the keyboard had guessed his thoughts, but a small disclaimer suddenly appeared at the bottom, \u201cNote: The Fortune Pill doesn\u2019t work on the keyboard\u2019s lottery system.\u201dShit!Zu An nearly smashed the keyboard on the spot. It was true that the keyboard had brought him many conveniences, but the sheer frustration he went through using it was also the real deal too.If he couldn\u2019t use the Fortune Pill for the lottery, what use did he have for it? He was in the real world right now! It was not as if he was playing a game where luck could improve the equipment drop rate when he killed mobs.Rather than luck, I would rather get something to improve my looks.Hmm\u2026 but my looks don\u2019t need any more improvement though.---Propriety, in Chinese, is a much more expansive word, encompassing the ideas of manners, etiquette, and values.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An finished spending all of his Rage points on the lottery, but he didn\u2019t get anything new. It was all either \u2018Thanks for playing\u2019 or Ki Fruits.In the end, his total loot consisted of 55 Ki Fruits, a bottle of Faith in Brother Spring, and a Fortune Pill. With more test cases to analyze here, he could reliably figure out that the probability of a Ki Fruit appearing was roughly 1-in-10. It would appear that his luck was simply not that good previously.Following that, he secretly swallowed all of the Ki Fruits one after another and watched as the golden stuff in the first formation inside his muscles slowly fill up. By the time he ate the 55th Ki Fruit, his first formation was already full, and there was a bit of golden stuff in his second formation too.\u201cIt looks like it really obeys the Fibonacci sequence,\u201d Zu An muttered to himself.Based on the Fibonacci sequence, the previous number was 34, which meant that the current number should be 55. The result matched his hypothesis.As for the additional bit of golden stuff in his second formation, that was actually the additional ki he had accrued from accidentally bumping into the wall while testing out Grandgale.According to the rules of the Fibonacci sequence, he would need at least 89,000 Rage points in order to clear the 2nd formation. This was really a huge pain to deal with.Why is it that other cultivators have it easy while I have to struggle to raise my cultivation through every step?However, thinking about it from another perspective, the other cultivators had to spend a lot of cultivation resources and study day in day out before they finally reached their current level. He didn\u2019t seem to have much grounds to complain about.Over the course of the day, he had gotten a rough grasp of the hierarchy inside the Brightmoon Academy. Those who had reached the fifth rank were true prodigies even on the national level. There were only a few of them who fitted into this category, and so far, the only ones he knew about were his wife, Pei Mianman, and that Yuan Wendong he met earlier on.Next on the hierarchy were those who had reached the fourth rank. They were also fairly respected in the academy, and there weren\u2019t many of them around either. Most of them had decent talent and considerable background.The students in the Earth class and Black class were mostly at the third rank, though there was a portion who hadn\u2019t reached there yet.As for the Yellow class, who boasted the greatest number of students of the entire academy, being at the second rank was more than enough for one to become the class bully.Going by this standard, Zu An could be considered to be average as compared to the other students in the academy. This realization soothed his heart by a fair bit.He ended spending the whole boring afternoon class entertaining himself through drawing the lottery. As soon as the class was over, a huge army of students immediately dashed out of the classroom for the academy\u2019s entrance, eager to get out of this place as soon as possible.As evidence had shown, he wasn\u2019t the only one who thought that the class was torturous.Even Wei Suo was no exception either. With a \u201cBoss, see you tomorrow~\u201d, he dashed off and vanished from view within moments.This familiar scene reminded Zu An of his previous life, how a stampede of students would occur as soon as the school bell rang. To be honest, he was starting to miss it a little.Zu An slowly packed up his stuff as he relished in the changes in his body after his most recent breakthrough. Right now, he should wield the strength equivalent to 143 adult men. Such strength should be sufficient to OHKO an elephant in his previous life.If he was already this strong at the third rank, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder just how terrifying those at the eighth rank, ninth rank, or even Masters would be.This world is really too frightening. If a weak man were to date a strong female cultivator, he might just end up getting accidentally crushed while they are getting hot and steamy with one another. If this were to happen, he would probably suffer from low self-esteem even after he has been reborn into another life.\u201cBrother-in-law, brother-in-law~\u201dZu An raised his head and saw Chu Huanzhao waving toward him excitedly outside the classroom. Her vivacious gestures made her feel more like a tomboyish girl as compared to her usual overly masculine feels.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zu An eyed her warily.\u201cWhat do you by what\u2019s wrong? We\u2019re heading home! What else can we possibly do?\u201d Chu Huanzhao immediately snapped back. \u201cWhat\u2019s with your attitude? I specially came all the way down here to find you as soon as the class ended!\u201d\u201cAh, so we\u2019re going home.\u201d Zu An exhaled deeply in relief. He honestly thought that this lass had come up with another darned idea to torture him.\u201cI made a wasted trip here yesterday because you didn\u2019t come to class,\u201d Chu Huanzhao grumbled in dissatisfaction. \u201cLucky I got my hands on you today. I have already signed a guarantee to my mother that I\u2019ll keep an eye on you.\u201dZu An was intrigued to hear those words. \u201cDidn\u2019t your mother send Hong Xingying here to keep an eye on me? Where is he? I still have a score to settle with him.\u201dChu Huanzhao scrunched her nose a little as she replied, \u201cThat fellow appears to have decided to take residence in the academy. He\u2019s probably frightened of getting punished once he returns to the Chu Estate, so he\u2019s seeking refuge here.\u201d\u201cThe academy provides lodging too?\u201d Zu An was surprised. This was yet another similarity between the Brightmoon Academy and the schools in his previous life.\u201cOf course,\u201d Chu Huanzhao replied. \u201cThe Brightmoon Academy is the best academy in the nearby municipalities, so there are many students who travel all the way to Brightmoon City to enroll here. Those who live in Brightmoon City can afford to return home every day, but those who came from abroad didn\u2019t have that kind of luxury, and thus the academy prepared lodging specifically for them. You see that building over there? Those are the dormitories.\u201dChu Huanzhao pointed to the west, and Zu An turned his eyes in the direction of her finger. In the faraway forest, he could vaguely make out a few buildings.\u201cI see,\u201d Zu An replied contemplatively. He wondered if he should specially make a trip over to the school dormitories one of these days. Perhaps, he might just make a huge killing of Rage points there.It was then that Zu An suddenly received an influx of Rage points. It was a small amount from each person, but the total amount was still substantial due to the quantity coming in.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dZu An raised his head to take a look around, only to see that many of those in the vicinity were eyeing him in hostility. It was then that he realized that the sight of him walking alongside Chu Huanzhao down a pathway sheltered by trees looked oddly picturesque.Huh, what\u2019s with this childhood lovers kind of atmosphere here?Zu An was surprised, but he quickly shook his head. He tossed some of the inappropriate thoughts he was harboring out of his head and decided to focus on earning Rage points.\u201cSister-in-law, hold my arm,\u201d Zu An said as he offered his left hand to Chu Huanzhao.Chu Huanzhao was confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re a family. Doesn\u2019t linking hands with one another perfectly display the harmony of our family?\u201d Zu An replied seriously.\u201cDo you take me for an idiot? You\u2019re trying to take advantage of me!\u201d Chu Huanzhao yelled angrily as she drew the Wailing Whip and flicked it toward him.\u201cHoly shit! If you don\u2019t want to hold my arm, so be it. There\u2019s no need to resort to violence!\u201d Zu An quickly dodged her whip as he shouted in a fluster.However, Chu Huanzhao continued to chase him, clearly not intending to let this matter drop that easily. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you, pervert!\u201dThe surrounding crowd suddenly felt a surge of exhilaration, as if gladdened to see that justice still existed in this world.Hah, this is what gigolos like you deserve! It ain\u2019t that easy to win the favor of those rich women!The chase between the two of them continued all the way to the entrance of the academy before finally settling down. It was not because Chu Huanzhao had found her conscience once more, but that Baldhead Lu De happened to be standing right there. His very presence somehow added a tinge of tension into the surrounding air, leaving everyone daring not to speak loudly.Even Chu Huanzhao was no exception to the rule.She stuck her tongue out at Zu An before tucking away her whip. She grabbed Zu An\u2019s sleeves and pulled him out of the academy together with her. \u201cHmph! Let\u2019s see if you dare to run your mouth again in the future. I\u2019ll settle the score with you once we get home!\u201dLu De scanned the crowd with sharp hawklike eyes, as if trying to scan out troublemakers and put a halt to their mischief before it even happened. However, when his eyes fell upon the duo holding onto one another, he suddenly jerked a little.What\u2019s going on with the Chu clan? Are they really planning on having the two sisters share a husband?While such matters weren\u2019t that uncommon in this world, it usually only happened if the guy was overwhelmingly outstanding. However, Zu An was a renowned wastrel in Brightmoon City, so how could he be worthy of something like this?Even the less eligible Second Miss of the Chu clan was far out of Zu An\u2019s league, let alone the two sisters combined.Oblivious to the fact that he had already caught Lu De\u2019s eyes, Zu An walked out of the academy and found Cheng Shouping waving his hand excitedly toward him. \u201cYoung master, young master~\u201d\u201cYou have been waiting here for me all day long?\u201d Zu An suddenly felt a little touched. Cheng Shouping had barely slept a wink yesterday in order to copy the family rules for him, but he still chose to loyally wait at the academy\u2019s entrance for him today.\u201cNo no, I went back to catch some sleep first before coming back here. I\u2019m flattered by your concern, young master,\u201d Cheng Shouping replied with a bright smile. \u201cHm? Young miss, you\u2019re here too?\u201dChu Huanzhao replied with a perfunctory \u201cMm\u201d. Her servant, who had been waiting outside for her, quickly led a stallion over for her. While Zu An could hardly discern between horses, he could still somewhat tell that it was a good steed from its appearance.The Chu clan really doesn\u2019t horse around.\u201cHm? Where\u2019s your steed?\u201d Chu Huanzhao took a look around as she asked in confusion.That question left Zu An slightly awkward, so Cheng Shouping ended up becoming the one to answer the question instead, \u201cThe young master and I walked here this morning.\u201dChu Huanzhao\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the servants in the estate assign a steed to you?\u201dShouldn\u2019t you know the reason yourself?, Cheng Shouping retorted in his mind. At the same time, however, he was also a little surprised to see that the young master was on fairly good terms with the Second Miss.Chu Huanzhao pondered for a moment, then she passed the steed back to her servant and told Zu An, \u201cI\u2019ll walk with you. It just so happens that I want to move my limbs a little.\u201d\u201cActually, I don\u2019t mind sharing a steed with you,\u201d replied Zu An.Cheng Shouping\u2019s face immediately paled upon hearing these words. The Second Miss was known for her bad temper, so Zu An was likely going to suffer the agony of the Wailing Whip for daring to say those words.\u201cScram!\u201d Unexpectedly, Chu Huanzhao berated him but showed no hints of making a move at all.Cheng Shouping blinked his eyes. Am I dreaming? Why does it feel like something is amiss here?It was at this moment that a mocking voice sounded, \u201cHoh, you\u2019re finally out.\u201dZu An turned his gaze over and saw a man with a scar on his face leaning against a tree looking at them. Who else could it be other than Plum Blossom Thirteen?\u201cHas no one told you that your mouth crooks a little when you smile?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +178 Rage!Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s smile froze in place before he spat coldly, \u201cHah, a sharp tongue is all you have! I\u2019m here to remind you that another day has passed, and it\u2019s almost time for you to return your debt. If you can\u2019t fork out the money by then, I\u2019ll be chopping both of your hands off.\u201d\u201cYou owe him money?\u201d Chu Huanzhao stared at Zu An with eyes widened in shock.Zu An nodded in response as he berated that dead fellow who got him into this huge mess.Chu Huanzhao retrieved her money purse as she asked, \u201cHow much does he owe you? I\u2019ll repay his debt.\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen was astonished. Is this wastrel doing so well that even this pretty lass is taking the initiative to repay his debt?With such thoughts in mind, he replied, \u201cHe owes me 1000 silver taels.\u201dChu Huanzhao gasped. She placed her purse back into her robe, slowly took a step back, and said, \u201cTreat it as if I hadn\u2019t said a thing at all.\u201dZu An eyed Chu Huanzhao in disdain. This lass keeps trying to show off, but in the end, she doesn\u2019t have the money to back her bragging. It was the same back at the canteen too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To be honest, he was really worried for a moment there that Chu Huanzhao would repay his debt. His goal here was not money but Zu An\u2019s life, after all!\u201cWe visited a gambling den a while ago to try our luck, and he ended up losing more than what he has.\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen felt that it was best to expose Zu An\u2019s true colors to this beautiful lass so that she wouldn\u2019t really repay his debt in a moment of hot-bloodedness. But speaking of which, this lass does look quite familiar to me.\u201cZu An, you son of a bitch! You actually gambled? Don\u2019t you know that that\u2019s a huge taboo in our Chu clan? Just last year, one of my cousins visited a casino and ended up getting his leg broken!\u201d Chu Huanzhao lashed out furiously.You have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +333 Rage!Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s heart skipped a jolt as realization finally struck him. This beautiful lass before him was no other than the Second Miss of the Chu clan! This is weird\u2026 I thought that the wastrel Zu An isn\u2019t welcomed in the Chu clan, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.Zu An also felt a huge headache setting in too. It was incredibly irritating to have Plum Blossom Thirteen haunting him day in day out. \u201cStop following me around like a vengeful spirit. I\u2019ll pay you back what I owe you, alright?\u201dAs he spoke, he reached into a pouch in his robe and said, \u201cI have 7 ki stones. This stuff can\u2019t be bought out there in the market, so they should be at least worth 800 silver taels. I have another 100 silver taels here too\u2026\u201dCheng Shouping\u2019s eyes nearly bulged out of his eyes. He was certain that the young master was still a poor bloke earlier in the morning, but just by spending a few hours in the academy, he suddenly emerged with plenty of money on hand.Meanwhile, Zu An was in an awkward position. Putting together everything of value that he had, he was still tens of silver taels away from fully repaying his 1000 silver taels debt. It was fortunate that Chu Huanzhao suddenly took out a ki stone and tossed it over at this moment.\u201cI have one more here. Keep the change as a tip, and you can get lost now!\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen doubtfully opened up the pouch Zu An had passed to him and verified that its contents were indeed real ki stones. He frowned in confusion and asked, \u201cHow did you get so many of them?\u201d\u201cIs that any of your business? Hurry up and give my debt note back.\u201d Zu An demanded with his outstretched hand.\u201cThat won\u2019t do. What if you stole these ki stones in the academy? We don\u2019t accept stolen goods,\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen exclaimed in a fluster. His true purpose was to take this fellow\u2019s name, and things were currently going awry right now. How was he to know that Zu An would actually have the means to repay the debt?\u201cI\u2019m good looking, so people gave it to me on their own accord. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can enter the academy yourself and ask around,\u201d Zu An harrumphed in disdain. \u201cYou keep on finding excuses to avoid returning my debt note to me; just what kind of intention are you harboring? Huanzhao, let\u2019s head back and tell our father about it. The Plum Blossom Sect is really trying to climb over our heads.\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen was utterly distressed right now. Typical drafted sons-in-law were usually embarrassed to admit their own identity since it was considered shameful to marry into the bride\u2019s family. Yet, Zu An had no qualms with identifying himself as a fellow member of the Chu clan, and the way he addressed Chu Zhongtian as father was so ironically natural.Shameless!That being said, he was indeed worried about the Brightmoon Duke getting involved in this matter as well. It was one thing if Zu An still owed them money, but he had already repaid his debt here. If he continuing clinging onto this matter, even a fool would be able to tell that they harbored malicious intentions in mind.\u201cEnough, enough! I\u2019ll return you your debt note, happy?\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen took out his debt note and passed it over. He had brought it over in case Zu An accused him of causing trouble in the vicinity of the academy, so he was intending to silence the spectators with the debt note. Yet, who could have thought that he would end up shooting himself in the foot?Zu An took the debt note and took a close look at it. It was indeed the one which he signed. \u201cSpeaking of which, didn\u2019t you mention that you have made copies? Take them out as well.\u201d\u201cI said that to pressure you. How can something like a debt note be copied that easily? Besides, a copied debt note carries no legal power at all,\u201d replied Plum Blossom Thirteen grudgingly.Zu An passed the debt note over to Chu Huanzhao to have the latter take a look at it. After ensuring that Plum Blossom Thirteen wasn\u2019t lying, he quickly tore the debt note into pieces before rubbing it between his both hands, reducing it into dust.One must know that he currently wielded the strength of 143 grown men. Crushing a piece of paper into dust posed no difficulty at all.However, he still wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. He couldn\u2019t help but think about the suave black flame Pei Mianman summoned previously. All she had to do was to snap her finger, and the problem automatically resolved itself. On the other hand, he still needed to squeeze the paper with all his might like a fool.\u201cSince the debt note has been erased, I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen was just about to take his leave and inform the sect master that he was unable to deal with Zu An through the debt note when a twist in the situation occurred.\u201cWait, don\u2019t go!\u201d Zu An suddenly exclaimed. Before Plum Blossom Thirteen could make sense of the situation, he continued shouting out loud, \u201cHelp me! Save me! The Plum Blossom Sect is trying to rob me here!\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen looked at Zu An as if he was an idiot, wondering what the latter was up to.However, he didn\u2019t need to ponder for long because the answer soon made itself apparent.A slight breeze brushed across them as a middle-aged man with a bald spot in the middle suddenly appeared before them. This middle-aged man gazed down at the three of them with a dark look on his face.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201dNeedless to say, the one who had just arrived was no other than discipline master Lu De. He was in the midst of patrolling around the area when he heard the commotion occurring over here, so he quickly rushed over.Zu An had intentionally shouted out loud because he knew that Lu De was in the vicinity, and he was gladdened that the latter really rushed here right away. Without any hesitation, he began sharing his sob story, \u201cTeacher, this man stole the ki stones we received from the academy!\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen nearly spurted blood on the spot. He hurriedly waved his hand and exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re lying! I didn\u2019t take your stuff!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +666 Rage!\u201cTeacher, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can check his pouch. The ki stones he stole from us were distributed by the academy, so there\u2019s an index number inscribed on every single one of them.\u201dIn order to prevent corruption within academies, the royal court had a strict quota as to how much cultivation resource each student was entitled to. This was enforced by inscribing an index number on each of the ki stones so that they could trace it down if anything were to occur.In order to avoid trouble, whenever the black market dealt with such ki stones, both parties would sign an agreement to ensure that it was a fair trade. Otherwise, they would at least make sure to erase the index numbers on the ki stones. However, Plum Blossom Thirteen wasn\u2019t familiar with the ki stone market, and he was also too preoccupied with discussing the failure of the debt note plan with his sect master that he ended up getting careless.\u201cBastard, you scammed me!\u201dWith things coming to this point, there was no way Plum Blossom Thirteen wouldn\u2019t get what was going on. This explained why that fellow was so forthright with handing his money over to him. As it turned out, he had just plans in mind!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +777 Rage!Zu An was tempted to rebut with a \u2018You aren\u2019t as dull-witted as I thought\u2019 to earn another wave of Rage points, but in view that Lu De was still standing right beside him, he put on the looked of a wronged victim and cried, \u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m lying? How awful! I\u2019m lucky that there\u2019s an eye-witness here who saw everything that happened earlier! He can testify for me!\u201dHe grabbed Cheng Shouping\u2019s arm and pulled him forward, \u201cAm I right?\u201dFeeling the immense force on his arm, Cheng Shouping immediately reacted. \u201cIndeed, this fellow stole our young master\u2019s ki stone! Uwaa, young master, why do you lead such a tough life? You get bullied no matter where you go!\u201dCheng Shouping\u2019s convincing act surprised Zu An. He was still worried that Cheng Shouping would let him down at this critical moment, but this fellow was really a born actor!I shall add a chicken drumstick for him for dinner!\u201cOf course he\u2019s going to speak up for you; he\u2019s your servant!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen cried out anxiously. This master-servant pair is really the very embodiment of shamelessness!A tight frown formed on Lu De\u2019s forehead. Instead of questioning Cheng Shouping, he turned o Chu Huanzhao and asked, \u201cChu Second Miss, is that really the case?\u201dLu De could still address Chu Huanzhao directly by her name in the academy, but now that they were outside, he had to show some respect to the Brightmoon Duke.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Not only did this Plum Blossom-something steal his ki stone, but he also stole mine as well! Teacher, if you don\u2019t believe my words, you can check his pouch. One of the ki stones in there should have my index number\u2026\u201d Chu Huanzhao further fanned the flames with her sharp words. Her beautiful appearance was much more efficient at evoking pity than Zu An, allowing her to easily rile up a man\u2019s desire to protect.A couple of students who had just gotten off classes heard what Chu Huanzhao said, and they suddenly felt a strong urge to dash forward and tear the vile criminal, Plum Blossom Thirteen, into shreds.Zu An\u2019s lower jaws nearly fell right onto the ground. Out of fear that things would go awry, he prepared a long, passionate monologue to convince Lu De, but his partners turned out to be much more reliable than he thought.As Chu Huanzhao pitifully complained to Lu De about how he got bullied, for a moment there, Zu An thought that he saw a pair of devil\u2019s horns on top of her head. He told himself that no matter who he offended in the future, he must make sure to never offend this lass.Meanwhile, Plum Blossom Thirteen found himself feeling so stifled that he felt that he was going to suffer from a hemorrhage soon.Despite this Chu Second Miss\u2019 innocent appearance, she\u2019s able to lie so smoothly without batting an eyelid! Aren\u2019t ladies of noble clans supposed to be upright and dignified?!My godfather was right! Nobles are all downright scums who engage in deception and debauchery!Sensing Lu De\u2019s gaze turning to him, Plum Blossom Thirteen felt a shudder run down his spine, and he hurriedly explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201dBut before he could explain everything, Lu De had already cut him short. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for words here. The truth will be out once we check your pouch.\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen still had words to say, but a ruler that felt as heavy as a mountain suddenly pressed down on his shoulder, squeezing the air out of his lungs. Even breathing was difficult to him, let alone explaining himself.Such a situation alarmed him.One must know that he was the strongest one of the Thirteen Guardians of the Plum Blossom Sect. He was the Plum Blossom Sect\u2019s sharpest knife when it came to fights in the underworld, and rarely had he ever failed his mission. Yet, this bald man was actually able to render him completely powerless with just a ruler.It was no wonder why the sect master had warned him strictly not to mess with those in the academy.But I didn\u2019t do anything at all!Plum Blossom Thirteen had done a lot of bad things in his lifetime, and he was prepared to face any enemies who tried to get back at him. Yet, this was the one time that he was left feeling so frustrated. It was all that scoundrel\u2019s fault!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +888 Rage!Zu An noticed that Plum Blossom Thirteen was glaring at him furiously, so he responded with an embarrassed smile, which only brought about another offering of Rage points.Meanwhile, Lu De examined the 8 ki stones in the pouch carefully before casting them aside angrily. He eyed Plum Blossom Thirteen coldly and harrumphed. \u201cThese ki stones are from our academy, and the index numbers indicate that they have only been issued earlier today. What do you have to say for yourself?\u201dThe ruler pressing his shoulder down finally loosened a little, giving Plum Blossom Thirteen a chance to catch his breath and explain himself. \u201cI was wronged! The two of them gave the ki stones to me on their own accord! Zu An owed me 1000 silver taels from gambling, and they were using the ki stones to offset the debt!\u201dZu An immediately refuted his argument with a cold sneer, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should at least try harder when searching for an excuse? Who in the entire Brightmoon City doesn\u2019t know that the Chu clan punishes their clan members harshly for gambling? Just last year, there was a fellow who got his legs crushed by the Brightmoon Duke for fooling around in the casino. As a drafted son-in-law, no matter how brazen I might be, there\u2019s no way I would dare to dabble in gambling, let alone incur a debt of 1000 silver taels!\u201d\u201cIndeed! Who doesn\u2019t know that our Chu clan is extremely strict on gambling?\u201d Chu Huanzhao placed her hands on her waist as she agreed sassily. \u201cYou should at least do your homework first before coming up with a lie!\u201d\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen nearly suffered a stroke right there and then. This pair of adulterous couple!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +999 Rage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His gut feeling was telling him that something was amiss here.\u201cTaking a thousand steps back, even if I did owe you money from gambling, where\u2019s the debt note then? Why don\u2019t you bring out the debt note and show everyone?\u201d said Zu An.Plum Blossom Thirteen shouted back in agitation, \u201cI\u2019ve already given you the debt note!\u201dZu An raised his hands up high and said innocently, \u201cTeacher, so as to prove my innocence, I ask you to search my body to see if I have the debt note he speaks of!\u201d\u201cYou tore the debt note up earlier!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen finally understood why Zu An did what he did earlier on. From the very start, the latter was already scheming to do him in!Zu An sighed helplessly before answering, \u201cEven if I tore the debt note, there should still be traces of it around, right?\u201d\u201cYou crushed it so thoroughly that they scattered with the wind earlier!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen exclaimed insistently.Zu An shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re really forcing your point over here. Who in the Brightmoon City doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m a renowned wastrel? If I do have the ability to crush a piece of paper to that extent, would I have been assigned to the Yellow class in the first place?\u201d\u201cBut he really\u2026\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen felt a chill running down his spine. He anxiously turned to Lu De to explain the matter, only to be cut off.\u201cEnough!\u201d Lu De roared furiously. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the misdeeds your Plum Blossom Sect does out there, but I won\u2019t stand for you bullying our students! Today, I\u2019ll break two of your legs. Go back and tell Mei Chaofeng that if his subordinate dares to mess with the academy once more, I won\u2019t be showing any mercy anymore.\u201dLu De flicked his sleeves, and the ruler shot straight for Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s knee joints. There were two resounding \u2018thwacks\u2019, and the latter suddenly fell over with a yelp of agony.Judging by how Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s legs were struck out of place, Zu An could tell that it was a complete fracture, and he gasped in astonishment. He had heard from Wei Suo just how excruciating Lu De\u2019s ruler was, but compared to what Plum Blossom Thirteen went through, it was apparent that Lu De had really been going easy on them.But what was even more shocking was how Lu De used his ruler earlier. He wasn\u2019t even holding his ruler earlier on\u2014the ruler struck down on Plum Blossom Thirteen legs on its own accord before flying back into Lu De\u2019s hand.\u201cThat thing is actually an artifact!\u201d Zu An reminded himself to never allow himself to fall into Lu De\u2019s hands, or else he could very well suffer the same fate!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +567 Rage!The groaning Plum Blossom Thirteen shot a venomous glare at Zu An.This was simply how humans were like. Plum Blossom Thirteen dared not to blame Lu De, who was far stronger than him, so he could only vent his emotions on the weaker Zu An instead.He told himself that he would surely snap off that scoundrel\u2019s four limbs\u2014no, five limbs!\u2014once he recovered from his injuries. Then, he would slice off his meat slice by slice and toss it into Wolf Valley!Lu De passed the ki stones back to Zu An and said deeply, \u201cTake care of it well. You\u2019re too weak at the moment, so it\u2019s even more important for you to learn how to conceal your own wealth.\u201dZu An hurriedly nodded his head and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re right, teacher. However, that fellow also stole my taels as well. I need you to help me get it back as well\u2026 Ahahahaha\u2026\u201dThis fellow sure is trouble, Lu De thought to himself. However, in view that Zu An was indeed a student of the academy, he directed his hand toward Plum Blossom Thirteen, and with a beckoning gesture, the latter\u2019s money pouch immediately flew out and landed in his hand.\u201cHow much money did he take from you?\u201d asked Lu De.Zu An took the entire money pouch and said, \u201cThis is all mine. Thank you, teacher. Thank you, teacher.\u201dLu De\u2019s frown further tightened. It was not that he wasn\u2019t suspicious of Zu An, but he was aware that Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s hands weren\u2019t clean, so his money probably came through dirty means. Due to that, he decided not to think too much into it and allowed Zu An to do as he pleased.On the other hand, Plum Blossom Thirteen immediately cried in indignation, \u201cThose taels are mine!\u201dYou only gave me 100 silver taels earlier on! The remaining 800 silver taels are money which I have painstakingly saved up over the last few years!Plum Blossom Thirteen didn\u2019t expect Zu An to actually be this shameless as to actually steal his money as well! He never trusted anyone except for himself, so he always chose to bring his money around with him no matter where he went. Yet, who could have thought that his many years of savings would be stolen from him just like that?You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +1000 Rage!\u201cYou\u2019re saying that this is your money?\u201d Hearing those words, Zu An dangled the money pouch before the incapacitated Plum Blossom Thirteen leisurely. \u201cTry calling for them then. Let\u2019s see if they\u2019ll respond to your call?\u201dAnd that was the final blow.Unable to take it anymore, Plum Blossom Thirteen felt a rush of blood assaulting his heart, and fresh blood spurted out from his mouth.What the hell! Who in the world is the antagonist here?You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +1000 Rage!Lu De shot a glance at Plum Blossom Thirteen and Zu An, but he decided not to interfere in the end. He waved his hand toward the crowd and said, \u201cAlright, show\u2019s over. Stop loitering around and go home!\u201dZu An waved Plum Blossom Thirteen goodbye before leaving with Chu Huanzhao and the others.\u201cJust you wait, Zu scoundrel! Our Plum Blossom Sect definitely won\u2019t be letting you off that easily!\u201d The echoes of Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s vile curses could be heard even from a distance away.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +1000 Rage!Zu An shook his head. This wasn\u2019t the first time the Plum Blossom Sect tried to deal with him, and it would be naive of him to think that he would be able to survive their assassination attempts every single time. He would have to find a way to deal with them soon.After walking a distance away, Cheng Shouping finally couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and ran up to him with a fawning smile, \u201cYoung master! My respect for you flourishes like the relentless tides of a river\u2026\u201d\u201cFlourishes your head!\u201d Zu An shoved Cheng Shouping\u2019s head aside. Then, he reached into Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s money pouch, took out a silver ingot, and threw it to Cheng Shouping. \u201cHere, your reward. You did well earlier.\u201d\u201cThanks, young master~\u201d Cheng Shouping fondled the silver ingot delightfully.\u201cWhere\u2019s mine?\u201d Chu Huanzhao stretched her fair hands, which were as smooth as jade, and demanded.Zu An also tossed a silver ingot to her, only to have Chu Huanzhao raise her eyebrows at him. \u201cSo little? Are you trying to wave off a beggar over here?\u201dThe smile on Cheng Shouping\u2019s face immediately froze. He felt that he had just been offended.Zu An also felt a headache setting in. \u201cHow much do you want then?\u201d\u201cAt least half of it!\u201d Chu Huanzhao exclaimed excitedly. She had never felt such a strong feeling of accomplishment before. She did get her way in the Chu Estate, but it never felt satisfying because no one dared to stand in her way anyway due to her standing.\u201cHalf of it? This is daylight robbery!\u201d Zu An exclaimed in horror.\u201cHmph! If I hadn\u2019t backed you up there, do you think that Baldhead would have believed you so easily?\u201d Chu Huanzhao stuck her small chests out proudly. \u201cI put the reputation of our Chu clan on the line in order to help you! Don\u2019t you think that this is at least worth half of the loot?\u201d\u201cThe highest I can go is a third,\u201d Zu An replied sharply as he shoved a few banknotes over.It was only then that Chu Huanzhao finally let the matter slip. She counted the few notes she had in her hands again and again with an excited gleam in her eyes.\u201cSay, do you really need to act like this? No matter what, you\u2019re still the Second Miss of the Chu clan! Do you need to get so excited over just a few hundred silver taels?\u201d Zu An eyed her in disdain.\u201cThat\u2019s different. This is money that I didn\u2019t receive from my parents; money that I earned with my own hands. Isn\u2019t that a cause for celebration?\u201d Chu Huanzhao replied with a sweet smile.Does this lass have some kind of misunderstanding as to what \u2018earning money\u2019 means? If her parents were to learn that I have led her astray, wouldn\u2019t they skin me alive?!Just thinking about the tigress Qin Wanru was more than enough to make Zu An shudder in fear. He quickly grabbed Chu Huanzhao\u2019s arm and told her gravely, \u201cMake sure not to speak a word of this matter to your parents.\u201d\u201cWhy? This is the first time I\u2019m earning money; they would be happy about it!\u201d Chu Huanzhao blinked her eyes in confusion.\u201cErrr\u2026\u201d Zu An pondered for a moment before explaining the matter to her from another perspective. \u201cGiven your understanding of them, do you think that they\u2019ll allow you to continue earning money through such a method?\u201d\u201cHmmm. Well, I guess what you said makes sense too. Fine, I won\u2019t tell them then.\u201d Chu Huanzhao carefully slotted the banknotes into her robe before patting Zu An\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMake sure to call me the next time you have a good deal like this!\u201dZu An was amused. Isn\u2019t this lass a born tyrant?Once they arrived at the Chu Estate, the two of them parted ways. After all, their residences were not located in the same direction.Zu An returned to his little house and pulled Cheng Shouping over to one side. \u201cLittle Pingping, do you know how much it costs to buy a small residence in the city?\u201dTo be honest, he wasn\u2019t really enjoying the disdain he was receiving in the Chu Estate, not to mention that there was someone in the Chu clan who was out for his life. It would be much more comfortable and safer to get his own house instead.It was one thing if he had no way around it, but since he had hundreds of silver taels and 7 ki stones that he could trade for money, he could be considered as a thousandaire now.Back in his previous world, there were no men who didn\u2019t dream of traveling back to the ancient era and being surrounded by gorgeous wives and beautiful maids, living an easy and decadent life\u2026 And now that he was in this world, he finally had a chance to fulfill his dreams!\u2018Gorgeous wives\u2019 was probably impossible for the current him, but at the very least, he could aim for \u2018beautiful maids\u2019, right?Cheng Shouping\u2019s face immediately drooped in sorrow as he asked, \u201cYoung master, are you going to abandon me?\u201d\u201cCut that out! Stop portraying me out to be a heartless man trying to dump you!\u201d Zu An snapped angrily. \u201cI just want to get a small residence so that I\u2019ll have somewhere to go to when things aren\u2019t going well. If you wish to continue following me then, you\u2019re more than welcome to. Also, do you know how much do beautiful maids cost?\u201dThe mention of \u2018beautiful maids\u2019 immediately sparked a gleam in Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes. He immediately began analyzing the costs for Zu An, \u201cWell, a small residence costs around several hundred silver taels, though some of the more rundown ones can probably be acquired at a hundred silver taels. As for beautiful maids though, they can get pretty pricey. Over at the market, their prices range from tens to over a thousand silver taels.\u201dZu An felt relieved that the housing prices here weren\u2019t as ridiculous as his previous world. Otherwise, 1000 silver taels was around 180,000 RMB, which was only enough for him to buy a toilet in the city.\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge price difference amongst different maids?\u201d Zu An was surprised. \u201cHow is it that some of them cost over a thousand silver taels?\u201d\u201cI heard that those are skilled in the four arts, be it zither, chess, calligraphy, or painting. On top of that, they are also as beautiful as fairies from heaven\u2026\u201dBefore Cheng Shouping could finish his description, Zu An waved his hand and said, \u201cEnough enough, I\u2019m not planning to open a brothel here. Why would I need my maids to be so multi talented? We\u2019ll just look for some of the more decent looking ones with a gentle disposition. As for skills, those aren\u2019t important at all.\u201dCheng Shouping nodded quietly in agreement, but he shared very different thoughts on the inside. Just say so if you can\u2019t afford it. There\u2019s no need to insist that you don\u2019t need them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am the man who keeps secrets like a cork on a bottle, Cheng Shouping!\u201dSomehow, that assurance only stoked Zu An\u2019s unease. He felt like he had just planted a terrible flag here.\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to look into the matter. I\u2019m feeling a bit tired right now, so I\u2019ll rest for a while first. Ah right, get me a bucket of water to wash my face first,\u201d Zu An dismissed Cheng Shouping with a wave of his hand.He was hoping to wash his hands and face first before using the Rage points he had just earned from Plum Blossom Thirteen to draw the lottery. He suddenly felt like his future looked very bright.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d an old, hoarse voice suddenly sounded.Zu An leaped in shock. He quickly turned around and saw Old Mi standing behind him. With his heart still throbbing from the jump scare, he retorted, \u201cWhy do you always walk around without making any sound? You\u2019ll really scare me to death one of these days!\u201dOld Mi ignored Zu An\u2019s remark and asked his own question, \u201cYou didn\u2019t play truant today, right?\u201d\u201cYou already warned me beforehand, so how would I dare?\u201d Looking at the deep eyes that were hidden by layers of skin folds, Zu An suddenly had a feeling that he would have suffered the same fate as Plum Blossom Thirteen had he dared to play truant today.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Old Mi laughed eerily. \u201cDid you meet Wei Hongde?\u201dOld Mi\u2019s smile made goosebumps rise all over Zu An\u2019s body.\u201cNot yet.\u201d A frown immediately started forming on Old Mi\u2019s forehead, which prompted Zu An to quickly supplement on. \u201cHowever, I managed to become friends with his younger brother.\u201d\u201cHe has a younger brother?\u201d Old Mi was confused.\u201cYes, his name is Wei Suo\u2026\u201d Zu An briefly explained the situation.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that he would have another son. Heh, it looks like he\u2019s living quite a good life, hm?\u201d Old Mi muttered under his breath.Zu An was stunned for a moment before asking, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Old Mi shook his head. He tossed a pouch of silver taels to Zu An and said, \u201cTake this money. Treat those two brothers to a meal and hang out with them more. I need you to get on closer terms with them.\u201d\u201cMay I know what\u2019s the reason for that? Can you let me in on it too so that I can prepare myself beforehand?\u201d Zu An tried probing a little.Another chillingly eerie smile surfaced on Old Mi\u2019s face as he replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll know in due time.\u201d Then, he began to stagger away.Zu An was a little dumbfounded. You can\u2019t be trying to get me to steal some kind of secret treasure in the royal treasury, are you?He quickly counted the money in the pouch he had just received from Old Mi and found that there were a hundred silver taels in total. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder how an old farmer inside the Chu Estate managed to save up so much money.With a deep sigh, Zu An decided not to think too much into it for now. He turned his attention to the keyboard and checked on his Rage points. He originally only had 54 Rage points left after spending it up in the afternoon, but it had risen back up to 8305.It was just a short encounter, but Plum Blossom Thirteen had single handedly provided him with more than 8000 Rage points!Nevertheless, Zu An was still a little dissatisfied. Once again, the result had proven that it was much more efficient to farm using AOE skills than single target skills. He could only hope that there would get more enemies like Plum Blossom Thirteen.He earnestly washed his face with systematic movements that looked as if they could have come out of a ritual before turning his attention to the lottery. However, before he could start, a servant suddenly rushed in and reported, \u201cYoung master, the Master and the Madame are calling you over right now!\u201dZu An widened his eyes in shock. It can\u2019t be that they already know about me leading Chu Huanzhao astray, can it?With a feeling of unease in his heart, he followed the servant around the estate. The servant led him from corridor to corridor, navigating an incredibly complicated pathway. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but suspect that the servant was leading him into some sort of trap.It was only when the two of them finally arrived before a hall with plenty of maids standing at the doorway that he finally heaved a sigh of relief. With so many people around, I doubt that they would try to pull anything.It was then that Zu An noticed that there was one particular lass with a slender waist and a delicate ponytail dressed in a green robe. He was a little alarmed by her appearance, but he maintained a brilliant smile on his face as he walked over and said, \u201cOh? It has only been a few days since we last met, but Snow, your waist got even slimmer. Are you not eating well outside? Aw. Come, I\u2019ll help you massage it a little.\u201dAs he spoke, his hands darted forth to hug that lass.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +256 Rage!Zu An was a little surprised. He didn\u2019t know that Snow wasn\u2019t her real name. It was quite rare for maids to have a proper surname and name these days, let alone such an eloquent one. It seems like this lass has quite a mysterious background to her.Even though he managed to infuriate Snow back then, he hadn\u2019t awakened the Rage system back then. Thus, this was the first time he was seeing her true name.The young lass easily dodged his hands before glaring at him frostily. \u201cIt has been a few days, but you\u2019re still as detestable as ever.\u201dZu An\u2019s face immediately turned grim. \u201cYou\u2019re going a little overboard here. No matter what, we did spend a night with one another. Are you going to shirk off responsibilities now that you got your clothes back on?\u201d\u201cYou!!!\u201d Snow\u2019s face flushed red right away.It was a huge trauma for her that her pure maidenly body was sighted by this dirty man.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +999 Rage!\u201cAre you angry? Hit me then. Hit me then~\u201d Zu An taunted like a little hoodlum. Back then, when she kicked him into the pond, he wasn\u2019t a cultivator yet, so he wasn\u2019t able to discern her level of strength. It was high time for him to check her out.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +1000 Rage!Snow was feeling faint with rage. She never thought that there would be such a shameless fellow in the world. Her fury burst right through the roof as she seriously considered heck care everything and pummel the man before her.\u201cStop messing around and come in!\u201d Chu Chuyan\u2019s unique cold, melodious voice sounded from the hall.Snow took a deep breath as she forced herself to calm down before speaking coldly, \u201cThe Master and Madame are waiting for you inside. You should hurry up and enter.\u201dZu An shook his head regrettably before tidying his clothes and entering the hall with widened strides.Chu Zhongtian, Qin Wanru, Chu Chuyan and Chu Huanzhao were seated around a round table, annd there were all sorts of exquisite dishes placed on the table. Chu Huanzhao shot him a glance, silently gesturing for him to take heed.This lass is still quite loyal after all. Looks like I didn\u2019t dote on her for nothing, Zu An thought.\u201cZu An, the audacity of you to seduce a maid of the estate in our presence. What do you take Chuyan for? What do you take our Chu clan for?\u201d Qin Wanru bellowed with a darkened face.You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +447 Rage!How could she possibly not be furious? In the first place, she was already dissatisfied with having her precious daughter marry such a wastrel, and yet, the latter still went around seducing the maidservants of the estate. This was preposterous!\u201cI didn\u2019t seduce her!\u201d Zu An cried out like a wronged victim.\u201cYou still want to argue your way through this? Do you think that our ears are there for decoration?\u201d Qin Wanru harrumphed.You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +522 Rage!Beside her, Chu Zhongtian coughed softly and explained, \u201cZu An, you might not be aware because you aren\u2019t a cultivator, but this bit of distance isn\u2019t much for us. We can hear everything happening outside loud and clear.\u201dZu An felt that Chu Zhongtian was really quite a good person. \u201cFather-in-law, I really am not lying. That\u2019s because Snow is already my woman.\u201dThose words caused a ripple of shock to wash through everyone present. Even Chu Chuyan, who was watching the drama leisurely as if she had nothing to do with it, ended up choking on her tea. She hurriedly took out her handkerchief to wipe off the tea that had spurted out of her mouth.Chu Zhongtian also stared at Zu An in disbelief, though his shock was mixed with a tinge of respect too.Qin Wanru\u2019s mouth fell agape, and it looked like her mind had short-circuited a little there.Chu Huanzhao was in the midst of sneaking some food into her mouth when she heard those words, and she secretly snuck him a thumbs up. She earnestly thought that her brother-in-law was really quite a formidable figure. It was no wonder why Plum Blossom Thirteen got done in so badly.\u201cZu An, how can you spout such nonsense?!\u201d The infuriated Snow immediately darted right in and berated Zu An.Similar to how Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru could hear what was going on outside, it was only to be expected that Snow, who had pricked up her ears to listen to the happenings inside, would be able to hear what was going on inside too.The moment she heard Zu An claim that she was his woman, she nearly lost her mind.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +999 Rage!Bam!Qin Wanru slammed her palm on the table and berated, \u201cWhere have your manners gone? Get out!\u201dSnow looked at Qin Wanru indignantly, and she attempted to protest weakly, \u201cMadame, I\u2026\u201dChu Chuyan also interjected in as well, \u201cSnow, you should leave the room for now.\u201dLeft with no choice, Snow could only back out of the room. She didn\u2019t forget to direct a vicious glare at Zu An before walking out.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +400 Rage!Watching all of these, Zu An chuckled on the inside as he praised himself for his sharp wits. All it took was a single sentence from him to earn this huge sum of Rage points.As soon as Snow left the room, Qin Wanru\u2019s gaze turned so severe that it looked like she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to strangle someone. \u201cZu An, you better tell us what\u2019s going on here. Do you know that we reserve the rights to sentence a drafted son-in-law like you to death for seducing a maid in the estate?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +587 Rage!Zu An lamented in his mind that drafted sons-in-law really had no human rights at all. Sighing softly to himself, he began explaining himself unhurriedly, \u201cI didn\u2019t seduce Snow; Chuyan gave her to me. She personally ordered Snow to accompany me in bed.\u201dQin Wanru frowned upon hearing those words. She turned to her daughter and asked, \u201cChuyan, is that true?\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with my daughter? Did she really send a woman to her own husband? I thought that I should have already set a good example for her to follow. All these years, have I ever allowed any woman to approach your father?, Qin Wanru wondered.Chu Chuyan\u2019s face flushed red. She shot a maddened glare at Zu An before answering, \u201cMother, I did say such words. However, it was intended to be no other than a joke. You need not listen to his nonsense.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d Qin Wanru asked doubtfully.\u201cOf course!\u201dChu Chuyan shot a glance at Zu An and said, \u201cHurry up and take your seat. You should watch what you say in the future, or else you wouldn\u2019t even know who you have offended.\u201dZu An immediately protested against those words, \u201cThat won\u2019t do! I\u2019m relying on my mouth for a living!\u201dHow was he supposed to earn Rage points if he didn\u2019t run his mouth?Those words evoked laughter from Chu Huanzhao. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you make a living out of your face?\u201dZu An answered her question with hardly any embarrassment at all, \u201cI\u2019m going down both routes. It\u2019s always better to expand your field of specialties so as to remain competitive on the market.\u201d\u201cEnough! Stop talking all of that nonsense and eat!\u201dFor some reason, Qin Wanru felt a little irritated by the friendly chatter between Zu An and her second daughter.Zu An got onto his seat before directing a discreet look at Chu Chuyan. To be honest, this woman did treat him fairly well. Despite the earlier circumstances, she still didn\u2019t reveal his impotence. That would have effectively dispel any doubts that Qin Wanru harbored between him and Snow.\u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d Without turning to look at Zu An, she picked up a piece of vegetable as she asked nonchalantly.\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019ve read books where they describe a woman to be \u2018so beautiful that one couldn\u2019t resist feasting on her looks\u2019. To be frank, I was quite skeptical at the start, but I\u2019m starting to see it for myself,\u201d replied Zu An with a smile.His wife\u2019s side profile was truly perfect in every sense. Her smooth and delicate skin looked so inviting; it was such a pity that he couldn\u2019t give her a kiss.Chu Chuyan was a little surprised to hear those words. \u201cLooks like you have gotten much more optimistic than before?\u201dZu An knew that she was referring to his impotence. He kicked up a huge uproar the last time she saw it. \u201cI was still brooding over it earlier on, but all of my frustrations seem to vanish in the face of your beauty.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA furious blush consumed Chu Chuyan\u2019s cheeks. There were plenty of people who praised her beauty over the years, but most of them did it in an indirect manner. This was the first time someone had so directly and passionately complimented her, such that she was starting to feel a little self-conscious.Meanwhile, Qin Wanru\u2019s frown only deepened upon hearing those words. This fellow sure has a slippery tongue. The more I look at him, the more hateful he becomes.Chu Zhongtian reminded with a light cough, \u201cIt\u2019s impolite to speak on the dining table.\u201dZu An decided to rein himself in for now, so the group of five ended up eating their meal silently. It didn\u2019t take them long for them to finish up, and the servants quickly entered with saltwater for them to gargle their mouth with while quickly taking away the plates and utensils.To be frank, Zu An was a little perplexed at this situation. Food was usually sent to his room, and yet, he was called over to the main table today to eat together with the rest of the family. Was this a sign that he was starting to get accepted by them?While he was deep in thought, Chu Zhongtian suddenly spoke up, \u201cChuyan, how is your trip to Luling?\u201dZu An was a little taken aback. They were going to talk business in his presence? Did they really no longer view him as an outsider?\u201cI investigated the matter, and it would appear that the goods were intercepted by the Blackwind Stockade. I swept the area with my men, but it was as if they had vanished from the face of the world. I couldn\u2019t find any traces of them at all,\u201d replied Chu Chuyan.\u201cBlackwind Stockade?\u201dZu An fell into deep thought.Two days ago, when he met Yu Yanluo at a mountain valley outside the city, he met a group of people who identified themselves as bandits from the Blackwind Stockade. Just thinking of the matter really infuriated them. Yu Yanluo simply left him with an empty cheque before performing a vanishing act. Truly, the more beautiful a woman is, the more scheming she is.Chu Zhongtian sighed deeply and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the unique trait of the Blackwind Stockade. They are always able to sense danger and flee beforehand. As soon as we dispatch an army over, they would hike deep into the Hidden Dragon Mountain to seek refuge. We can\u2019t possibly dispatch an army to protect our good every single time. This is really a tough problem to solve.\u201dHe paused for a brief moment before continuing on, \u201cI heard that the Blackwind Stockade assaulted the Yu clan\u2019s convoy a while ago, and quite a few people died. I wonder if it\u2019ll be possible for us to work together with the Yu clan to deal with this poisonous tumor.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re just interested in Yu Yanluo, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Qin Wanru harrumphed coldly. \u201cThe Yu clan already has enough problems to deal with, so how could she possibly have the spare attention to help us deal with the Blackwind Stockade?\u201dChu Zhongtian\u2019s face immediately reddened. He pulled his wife\u2019s sleeves and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking. Besides, the kids are still around\u2026\u201dQin Wanru turned her head away coldly, completely ignoring her husband.A knowing smile emerged on Zu An\u2019s lips. It seemed like his father-in-law had courted Yu Yanluo in his younger years. Well, he could relate with that too. She was indeed unbelievably beautiful.Chu Chuyan broke the awkward atmosphere by clearing her throat, and she continued the report, \u201cOur arms business is facing a problem at the moment. The pollution of the spirit creek meant that our clan has already lost our greatest advantage when it comes to weaponcraft, but it would appear that the Yuan clan has found a fairly formidable runemaster to enchant their items. The weapons they create don\u2019t pale in comparison to us, and they\u2019re cheaper too. They have already eaten into quite a bit of our market share, and at this rate, our foundations might be shaken.\u201dZu An processed the information he had just heard. He remembered the slight blue glow he saw from a formation inscribed on Yu Yanluo\u2019s carriage\u2014that was probably the work of a runemaster. Runemasters were capable of adding functions on items, so naturally, weapons that were inscribed with runes tended to be more powerful than ordinary ones.If only that darned academy stopped preaching propriety and start teaching more practical knowledge, I wouldn\u2019t have been so bored out of my mind.In truth, Zu An had misunderstood the Brightmoon Academy. It was for a good reason that it was deemed to be the best academy within the nearby municipalities, and the teachers working there were the cream of the crop. It was only because he was in the Yellow class that he was learning about propriety and such stuff.Those in the Yellow class had barely any cultivation talent anyway, so it was meaningless for them to learn too much about cultivator-related subjects. As such, there was only a lesson or two every week that imparted to them general knowledge relating to cultivation.On the other hand, the other classes, especially the Sky class, were focused mainly on cultivation and had less of those propriety sort of lessons.\u201cHow in the world did the Yuan clan manage to hire a runemaster?\u201d Qin Wanru frowned. \u201cDid they have such connections?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t, but the neighboring Wu clan does. The patriarch of the Wu clan is a duke as well, and they have been interested in snatching up our Chu clan\u2019s market share for quite some time now. I\u2019ve looked into the matter, and the Wu clan is secretly backing the Yuan clan on this matter. Otherwise, the Yuan clan wouldn\u2019t have dared to challenge us openly,\u201d replied Chu Chuyan.\u201cIndeed! That Yuan fellow was really arrogant today at school. He said that he would teach my brother-in-law a lesson during the Clans Tournament!\u201d Chu Huanzhao had no place in the conversation thus far, but now that a familiar name had finally popped up, she immediately leaped at the opportunity to brush up her presence.\u201cThe Yuan clan is really too much! Even a servant or a dog of our Chu clan shouldn\u2019t face such oppression from them!\u201d Qin Wanru slammed her palm on the table as she flew into a state of rage. \u201cLet\u2019s go! We\u2019ll head over to the Yuan Estate to reason with them!\u201dZu An looked at Qin Wanru with grudging eyes, not hiding the fact that he was offended by her words at all.\u201cMy wife, you should calm down a little first. Sang Hong has already been appointed as the governor, and without a doubt, he\u2019s looking for a reason to crack down on us now.\u201d Chu Zhongtian quickly stood up and pulled his wife back. \u201cWe need to calm down and take things slow, or else we might just worsen our plight.\u201dZu An\u2019s eyebrows shot up. Despite the Chu clan\u2019s glamorous exterior, it would appear that it was surrounded by threats.Chu Zhongtian stroked his wife\u2019s back to calm her down while turning to Zu An to ask, \u201cZu An, Yuan Wendong must have made things difficult for you. Are you alright?\u201dBefore Zu An could respond, Chu Huanzhao had already butted right in. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Yuan Wendong. Even Hong Xingying wanted to deal with my brother-in-law too! He\u2019s supposed to be a subordinate of our Chu clan, but that damned two-faced scoundrel chose to side with outsiders instead!\u201dZu An felt touched by how Chu Huanzhao was speaking up for him. At the very least, she doted on him more than his own wife did.\u201cHong Xingying?\u201d Chu Zhongtian frowned.Beside him, Qin Wanru spoke up, \u201cI know that child. He has a huge ego, and he was really fond of your older sister previously. Naturally, he doesn\u2019t carry any goodwill toward Zu An. As you know, young people tend to be unable to rein in their emotions.\u201dChu Huanzhao wasn\u2019t willing to let things rest just like that. \u201cBut he\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Qin Wanru stopped her from speaking with a wave of her hand. \u201cThat child is a diligent one, and his father has been loyal to us for decades now. Don\u2019t bother talking about such minor matters in the future, or else it\u2019ll only chill their hearts.\u201dChu Huanzhao\u2019s cheeks puffed up in indignation. You\u2019re afraid of chilling the hearts of Hong Xingying and his father, but what about my brother-in-law then?Zu An, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t particularly fazed. He could understand how a useless drafted son-in-law like him had a lower significance than Butler Hong and his son. He had previously heard from Cheng Shouping that Qin Wanru was interested in having Chu Chuyan marry Hong Xingying, and it would appear that those weren\u2019t just rumors.He subconsciously shot a glance at Chu Chuyan, only to see that there was no peculiar emotion on her face. From the looks of it, it didn\u2019t seem like she was interested in Hong Xingying either.It was then that Chu Chuyan spoke up once more, \u201cActually, compared to everything else, I\u2019m more concerned about the Clans Tournament that\u2019s going to be held half a month from now.\u201dQin Wanru frowned. \u201cHaven\u2019t we won every single time thus far? As long as you\u2019re around, who in the Yuan clan could possibly be a match for you?\u201dChu Zhongtian shook his head and chirped in, \u201cThe Yuan clan isn\u2019t weak either. They share the same title as the Chu clan as one of the Four Merchant Powerhouses. It\u2019s only because they lack a noble position that they dare not to offend us thus far, so most of the tournaments we had thus far were mainly just for show. However, now that they have the Wu clan to back them, we can expect them to go all out. In fact, I suspect that the Wu clan might secretly dispatch their own cultivators down too.\u201dIt was then that he paused for a while before turning to look at Zu An with a conflicted look on his face. \u201cFurthermore, with Zu An participating as well, we\u2019ve already lost the first round.\u201dZu An was utterly dumbstruck. I was just watching the drama by the sidelines, so how in the world did I get implicated in this as well?\u201cAh, I\u2019m not a cultivator in the first place. Do I need to fight in the Clans Tournament too?\u201d\u201cAccording to the rules of the Clans Tournament, every single offspring of the clan must participate. In view that you\u2019re the son-in-law of our Chu clan, there\u2019s no way that the Wu clan and Yuan clan will allow you to sit out. We can also expect the governor to step in and denounce such a move from our part too. In fact, the main reason why we called you here today is to give up a heads up so that you can prepare yourself for it,\u201d said Chu Zhongtian.Those words left Chu Huanzhao feeling anxious. \u201cJust earlier today, Yuan Wendong proudly declared that he was going to cripple my brother-in-law! If we send our brother-in-law in as well, wouldn\u2019t that be the same as sending him to his death?\u201d\u201cThat works just fine,\u201d Chu Chuyan answered.Zu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Even if you aren\u2019t pleased with me, surely you shouldn\u2019t resort to such means to kill your own husband, right?Chu Huanzhao was utterly horrified too. She stared at Chu Chuyan in disbelief as she murmured, \u201cSister, you\u2026\u201dSeeing their expressions, Chu Zhongtian hurriedly cut right in. \u201cLet your older sister finish first. She wouldn\u2019t say such words for no reason.\u201dIt was only then that Chu Chuyan slowly continued what she was driving at. \u201cThe most outstanding offspring of the Yuan clan is no other than Yuan Wendong. I heard that he recently made a breakthrough to the fifth rank. I don\u2019t fear him, but we don\u2019t have anyone else in the clan who is a match for him, and the Yuan clan wouldn\u2019t be so foolish as to send him against me. In other words, Yuan Wendong is bound to win a single round since no one else will be able to deal with him.\u201cIf so, rather than to waste our experts on him, it would be much better to send Zu An against him. This way, there\u2019s still a chance for others to win their battles.\u201dZu An came to a realization. To have the weakest face the strongest so as to conserve their forces; it was basically the \u2018Tian Ji Racing Horse\u2019 strategy\u2026. Pui, what am I saying? I\u2019m not the weakest one here!Chu Huanzhao was still very uneasy about this plan. \u201cIsn\u2019t it still very dangerous for my brother-in-law?\u201dThose words brought a slight frown to Qin Wanru\u2019s forehead. Isn\u2019t my second daughter a little too concerned about that wastrel today?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll arrange for their match to be at the very last. If we manage to achieve an overwhelming advantage by then, the final match would be rendered meaningless. If so, we can simply call it off.\u201dChu Huanzhao blinked her eyes for a moment before asking, \u201cWhat if the victor hasn\u2019t been decided by then?\u201dChu Chuyan was also stunned for a moment before hurriedly shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it can\u2019t possibly be that coincidental.\u201dStop planting flags here!, Zu An retorted in his mind.He sighed softly before speaking up as well, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the victor hasn\u2019t been decided by then. As you know, the stars of the show usually make their appearances at the very end. I\u2019ll make sure to pull off a glorious comeback for the Chu clan if it comes down to that.\u201dIt took him only a couple of days to transform from an utterly inept human being to a third rank cultivator. Considering that he still had half a month on hand, he should be able to raise his cultivation by a fair bit. Even if he couldn\u2019t reach the fifth rank, considering all of the cheats he had on hand, he should still stand a fair winning chance with a good strategy.However, Zu An\u2019s assurance only brought a furrow to Qin Wanru\u2019s forehead. \u201cZu An, since Yan\u2019er has already chosen you, I shan\u2019t pursue your past anymore. However, can you at least kick off your habit of bragging? A man can be weak, but he must be of good virtue. Yuan Wendong has already reached the fifth rank, which means that he can already control the elements. Yet, you still want to fight against him and win? Haa!\u201dAfter saying those words, Qin Wanru got up to her feet, flung her sleeves, and left the hall.You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +763 Rage!Zu An shrugged leisurely, not bothering to explain anything at all.It would appear that Qin Wanru was deeply prejudiced against him. They always say that mothers-in-law tend to grow on their sons-in-law, but why did it seem like his relationship with Qin Wanru was getting worse and worse?---The Tian Ji Racing Horse Strategy is a story about a general named Tian Ji, who was invited to a horse-racing event to compete with the emperor. It was a race between each of their three horses, and the one to win two out of three of the races is the ultimate winner.Basically what Tian Ji did was toPit his best horse against the emperor\u2019s second best horse,Pit his second horse best against the emperor\u2019s worst horse,Pit his worst horse against the emperor\u2019s best horse.To put it in power level termsTian Ji\u2019s best horse (LV 100) VS Emperor\u2019s second best horse (LV 50) => Tian Ji winsTian Ji\u2019s second best horse (LV 50) VS Emperor\u2019s worst horse (LV 1) => Tian Ji winsTian Ji\u2019s worst horse (LV 1) VS Emperor\u2019s best horse (LV100) => Emperor winsSo that\u2019s the logic here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have good intentions in mind, but\u2026 Haa, you shouldn\u2019t think too much about this matter. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll settle the Clans Tournament.\u201dAfter saying his piece, he also turned around and left as well. Judging by his hurried footsteps, he seemed to be chasing after his wife.My father-in-law is really the typical example of a henpecked husband, but he\u2019s indeed a good person at heart. He does treat me well even though I\u2019m a wastrel. I just wonder if he\u2019s actually a sly, old fox who puts on a kind face\u2026Chu Huanzhao skipped over to Zu An\u2019s side to talk to him, only for Chu Zhongtian\u2019s voice to sound from outside the hall at the next moment. \u201cZhao\u2019er, your mother is looking for you!\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s excited face immediately collapsed. She helplessly waved Zu An goodbye before dragging her feet out reluctantly.\u201cYou\u2019re on good terms with Huanzhao?\u201d Chu Chuyan asked with a hint of surprise in her voice.Zu An replied with a gleeful smile, \u201cI\u2019m quite a likable person after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Chuyan.She stared at him for a moment before turning around to leave the hall. \u201cRight, I should give you a reminder. A man shouldn\u2019t make promises that he isn\u2019t able to fulfill.\u201dZu An felt a little wistful as to how there was not a single person here who was willing to trust him. He sure led quite the tragic life.All of a sudden, he recalled one matter and hurriedly rushed out of the hall, chasing after Chu Chuyan. \u201cHoney, honey~\u201dChu Chuyan immediately turned around and exclaimed, \u201cShut up! I told you not to call me that!\u201d\u201cYou only told me not to call me your wife.\u201d Zu An noticed that Chu Chuyan\u2019s eyebrows had shot up, and it looked like she was on the verge of exploding at any moment, so he quickly changed his words. \u201cThen, should I call you Yan\u2019er instead?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Chuyan.It sounds weird hearing him call me the same way my father and mother call me. But if I don\u2019t allow him to call me that, he might just keep calling me honey or darling!\u201cIf you still have any sense of shame, you should stop buzzing around the young miss\u2019 side like a fly!\u201d Snow leaped forward and cut right in between the two of them. As she spoke, she lowered her gaze toward his crotch disdainfully.\u201cWhat business is it of yours when I call out to my own wife?\u201d Zu An rolled her eyes. \u201cYou have also displayed yourself bare before me, but you still continue prancing around me all day long. Just which of us is the one who doesn\u2019t have a sense of shame here?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Snow\u2019s face immediately turned as red as an apple. That incident was the greatest blemish in her life, but this fellow still dared to raise it! Her rage hit the roof right away, and she was just a second away from drawing her sword to decapitate that darned man standing before her.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +999 Rage!\u201cEnough, the two of you should stop messing around.\u201d Chu Chuyan was worried that Zu An might really be sliced apart if she didn\u2019t intervene. \u201cSo, what did you call me for?\u201dZu An shot a glance at Snow and swiftly estimated the length of her sword before taking a few steps back to keep out of her attack radius. Then, he turned to Chu Chuyan and said, \u201cThere\u2019s someone who\u2019s out for your hubby\u2019s life. Are you going to get involved?\u201dSnow\u2019s heart skipped a beat, such that even her rage also subsided significantly as well. She stared at Zu An with a wavering expression as many thoughts flashed across her mind.On the other hand, Chu Chuyan couldn\u2019t help notice that Zu An had stopped calling her \u2018honey\u2019 but ended up addressing himself as her hubby. \u201cWho\u2019s out for your life?\u201dZu An first shot a glance at Snow and took her worried expression into sight before unveiling the mystery, \u201cThe Plum Blossom Sect.\u201d\u201cThe Plum Blossom Sect?\u201d Chu Chuyan was surprised. \u201cHow did you get involved with them?\u201dZu An shrugged helplessly as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. Typically speaking, someone who\u2019s as handsome and dashing as me shouldn\u2019t have any enemies, but those from the Plum Blossom Sect keep making attempts on my life. The last time I was struck by lightning was also the doing of Plum Blossom Twelve.\u201d\u201cAre you certain about it?\u201d Chu Chuyan\u2019s usual composed expression had collapsed to reveal hints of astonishment.Zu An nodded. \u201cWould I lie to my own wife?\u201dThat remark immediately brought about a retort from Snow, \u201cGo to the streets and ask around; the lies you have spouted are enough to craft out a story. Lying to your own wife\u2026\u201d A glare from Chu Chuyan prompted Snow to quickly correct herself. \u201c\u2026 Lying to the young miss doesn\u2019t pose any challenge to you at all!\u201dZu An stared at Snow deeply. \u201cSay, why do you keep trying to get in my way every single time? Are you trying to use this sort of lowly method to attract my attention?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Snow nearly choked on her breath and fainted on the spot. \u201cYoung miss, don\u2019t stop me. I must slaughter this darned scoundrel today!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +725 Rage!Zu An immediately ran to seek cover behind Chu Chuyan while Snow relentlessly pursued him with her sword in hand. Just like that, the two of them ran circles around Chu Chuyan, with neither being able to catch up or shake away the other.\u201cYan\u2019er, aren\u2019t you going to stop her? She\u2019s trying to kill your hubby!\u201d Zu An cried out in desperation while dodging Snow\u2019s attacks.Chu Chuyan shot a cold look at Zu An. \u201cIf you dare touch my body with those hands of yours once more, I\u2019ll be the one to slaughter you instead.\u201dZu An sheepishly released his grips. While he was dodging Snow\u2019s attacks, he didn\u2019t hesitate to come into physical contact with Chu Chuyan. It was just that he didn\u2019t expect Chu Chuyan to see through his intentions so quickly.But speaking of which, his wife\u2019s body felt surprisingly cold, almost like an ice sculpture.\u201cYou said that Plum Blossom Twelve was the one who caused you to get struck by lightning, but do you have any evidence?\u201d Chu Chuyan asked.\u201cHe confessed to it himself.\u201d Seeing that Chu Chuyan really had no intention of stopping Snow, he began to worry if she was really trying to get rid of him using Snow\u2019s hands this time around.\u201cWhere\u2019s he?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s dead. He got eaten by wolves.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have any evidence on hand. How can you expect the young miss to believe your words?\u201dChu Chuyan finally stopped Snow from pursuing Zu An any further before saying, \u201cSnow is right. Even though the Plum Blossom Sect has done many vile deeds over the years, they have quite a few connections around, making them hard to deal with. Without concrete evidence, we can\u2019t do anything much to them.\u201d\u201cYoung miss, I think that fellow is just spouting bullshit! Why would the Plum Blossom Sect risk offending our Chu clan to deal with him?\u201d Snow panted for air as her chest expanded and contracted rhythmically. She was surprised to see that Zu An\u2019s stamina was much better than she had imagined.Chu Chuyan nodded slightly in response, expressing her agreement with Snow\u2019s view. If they were to confront the Plum Blossom Sect right now, the latter would only claim that there was no evidence to incriminate them, and that would be the end of things.Hearing those words, Zu An regretted having killed Plum Blossom Twelve so quickly back then, He should have gotten the latter to write a will or something, though to be fair, he couldn\u2019t have possibly thought that far ahead then, and the circumstances didn\u2019t allow for it either.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t have any evidence on Plum Blossom Twelve, just earlier in the day at the academy\u2019s entrance, Plum Blossom Thirteen threatened to sever my limbs and cut my meat slice by slice till I\u2019m finally dead, There are many people who heard that, so I couldn\u2019t possibly have falsified that, right?\u201dA moocher should solve problems through his mooching ways.Zu An looked down on those who could have easily resolved some problems through their connections but had to act all high and mighty and insist on solving them with their own strength. In the first place, weren\u2019t connections part of a person\u2019s strength too?\u201cWhy would Plum Blossom Thirteen suddenly head to the academy to threaten you? In my view, they must be holding some kind of leverage over you!\u201d Snow grabbed Chu Chuyan\u2019s arm as she sneered at Zu An.Zu An looked at Snow with an unreadable smile as he remarked, \u201cI realized that you have been speaking up for the Plum Blossom Sect for quite a while now. It can\u2019t be that you have some ties with them, do you?\u201dSnow jerked in shock. She subconsciously shot a glance at Chu Chuyan as she hurriedly explained the matter, \u201cHow could I possibly be related to the Plum Blossom Sect? I just can\u2019t stand people like you spreading lies and falsehoods around!\u201d\u201cThere are many people who witnessed the incident today. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can call the Second Miss over to verify the matter. She witnessed the matter with her own eyes. Is the Chu clan really going to take this insult lying?\u201d Zu An exclaimed indignantly.Chu Chuyan was really impressed by how Zu An was willing to readily include himself as a family member of the Chu clan, speaking in its name without showing the slightest awkwardness at all.She pondered for a moment before answering, \u201cThe Plum Blossom Sect isn\u2019t as simple as it appears to be. So far, we still haven\u2019t managed to get a grasp as to which power is behind it yet. Besides, even though my father is a duke, he has no official roles in the royal court. It would be overstretching his boundaries if he attempts to take things into his own hands. So, there\u2019s very little we can do against a threat.\u201dZu An clicked his tongue in annoyance. \u201cYou can\u2019t deal with a mere underworld organization despite being a ducal clan. Even I feel ashamed for you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Chuyan.Snow put her hands on her hip and berated, \u201cAren\u2019t you getting ahead of yourself? Do you even know anything about court politics at all? Don\u2019t you know that those who are in a high position are often treading on thin ice? Stop spouting all of this nonsense if you don\u2019t know anything at all!\u201dZu An shot a glance at her and said, \u201cYes yes, you know everything. But what a pity it is that you\u2019re just a maid.\u201dA vein popped out from Snow\u2019s temple. She turned to Chu Chuyan and asked with pleading eyes, \u201cYoung miss, I really want to beat him up!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +367 Rage!Chu Chuyan chuckled softly. \u201cI understand how you feel, but you have to show some respect to him. He\u2019s the son-in-law of the Chu clan after all. The way you two keep bickering with one another looks almost like an old couple.\u201dSnow jolted in horror, and she cried out indignantly, \u201cWho\u2019s an old couple with him! Young miss, you shouldn\u2019t crack such jokes!\u201dCompletely disregarding Snow, Zu An turned to Chu Chuyan and said, \u201cForget it, I knew that the Chu clan can\u2019t be relied on. I have my own way of dealing with this matter, but I need you to back me up.\u201dThe Plum Blossom Sect had already sent Plum Blossom Twelve and Plum Blossom Thirteen after his life; Zu An wasn\u2019t the type of person to swallow down the grudge and forgive them. Besides, it was not as if they would let him off just because he was willing to forgive them. Since things had already come down to this, he might as well take the initiative to destroy the Plum Blossom Sect first.\u201cBack you up?\u201d Chu Chuyan frowned.\u201cI\u2019m asking you to support me,\u201d Zu An explained. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a trip to the Plum Blossom Sect later on. I don\u2019t need you to do anything; you just have to ensure my safety.\u201dSnow harrumphed coldly. \u201cAren\u2019t you just using our young miss\u2019 name to do as you please?\u201dZu An paid no heed to Snow\u2019s mockery. \u201cI don\u2019t mind doing it myself either. I\u2019m just worried that I\u2019d screw with the Plum Blossom Sect too hard that they end up resorting to desperate measures.\u201d\u201cYou screw the Plum Blossom Sect too hard? What a joke!\u201d Snow laughed at Zu An derisively, not bothering to hide the fact that she thought nothing of the latter at all.Chu Chuyan, however, nodded her head in agreement. \u201cVery well, I shall accompany you. However, I\u2019ll first make things clear that I\u2019m following you in my capacity as an individual. You won\u2019t have the backing of the Chu clan for this matter.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201dThe boulder in Zu An\u2019s heart was finally released. With Chu Chuyan around, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry for his own life anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d Snow asked with a deep frown.Zu An\u2019s confident look had sparked her curiosity.\u201cIt won\u2019t be fun if I tell you beforehand.\u201d Zu An wagged her finger at her before turning toward Chu Chuyan with an inviting gesture. \u201cYan\u2019er, this way.\u201dA slight knit formed between Chu Chuyan\u2019s brows. She was clearly uncomfortable with the way he was addressing her. However, considering how the shameless Zu An might come up with even worse ways to address her, she decided to let it slip in the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt that it wasn\u2019t a bad idea for the two of them to stroll under the moonlight and nurture their feelings for one another. It wouldn\u2019t be as romantic on a carriage, especially since they would arrive at their destination in a jiffy.Chu Chuyan also didn\u2019t insist on the carriage either, so the two of them ended up walking out onto the streets together.It didn\u2019t take long for them to draw the attention of the passers-by, though it was mostly due to Chu Chuyan. She had an appearance and disposition that would put her in the spotlight no matter where she went.Snow looked not bad either. She had an adorable face, which was further accentuated by her little ponytail. Some of the surrounding eyes were directed toward her too.As for Zu An, he was more or less just a sidekick meant to highlight the two beauties. Of course, the man himself vehemently disagreed with that opinion. He felt that his suave and dashing appearance had a fair chance at catching the eyes of the women around.\u201cLook, look! That\u2019s the First Miss of the Chu clan!\u201d\u201cOh my, she\u2019s really as beautiful as a fairy!\u201d\u201cThat maid standing next to her doesn\u2019t look bad either. She looks much more beautiful than most young misses of prominent clans!\u201d\u201cOf course! How can someone subpar be worthy of serving Miss Chu?\u201d\u201cOh? How would you justify that toad standing by her side then?\u201d\u201cAh, that fellow must be the renowned useless drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan. Just look at his oily face, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s nothing good.\u201d\u201cMiss Chu is pretty, but I must say that she doesn\u2019t have an eye for people.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that the son-in-law chosen by the Chu clan is no match for you?\u201d\u201cHaaa? Even I would beat that fellow with ease!\u201d\u2026The discussions coming from the crowd sounded extremely jarring to Zu An\u2019s ears.You\u2019re the toad, your whole family are toads!In order to further disgust those people who were talking bad about him, he intentionally stuck closer to Chu Chuyan, making it appear as if they were very intimate with one another.And just as he had expected, it immediately brought him a huge wave of Rage points.Gahahahahaha! Envy me more! I hope all of you die of envy!Zu An\u2019s heart bloomed with happiness. Wealth and a beautiful wife were meant to be flaunted. He would be letting down all of his haters if he didn\u2019t use such good resources he had on hand to earn some additional Rage points!\u201cDid you bring me out on a walk just to satisfy your shallow pride?\u201d Chu Chuyan saw through Zu An\u2019s intent right away, and she felt deep regret for choosing to go along with the latter. How was she to know that he would have such plans in mind?\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m just trying to nurture our feelings,\u201d Zu An replied with a smile.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Chuyan.Snow harrumphed coldly from the back. \u201cWhat kind of feelings could possibly be nurtured between you and our young miss? Stop putting yourself on a pedestal!\u201dZu An was already used to Snow\u2019s poisonous tongue, so he disregarded her remarks and rebuked her mercilessly, \u201cYour masters are speaking over here. Servants should know when to excuse themselves.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +300 Rage!\u201cYou!!!\u201d Snow pointed a finger at Zu An furiously. You are really forcing me to use my ultimate technique, huh? \u201cI guess heaven gave you a big mouth to compensate for what you\u2019re lacking there.\u201dAs she spoke, she shot a pitiful glance at his crotch.But surprisingly, Zu An didn\u2019t lose his anger at all. Instead, he choked her back with a \u201cRegardless of whether I\u2019m lacking or not, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m the first man who saw and touched your body.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +999 Rage!Snow really couldn\u2019t understand how this man could be so thick-skinned. Even while he was talking about her body, he showed no signs of embarrassment at all.Chu Chuyan finally reached the limits of her patience and berated the two of them, \u201cEnough! Don\u2019t the two of you find it embarrassing talking about such matters on the street?\u201dThe two of them turned their faces to the sides with a cold harrumph in unison.Seeing how the uncanny resemblance in their movements, Chu Chuyan suddenly had a ridiculous thought that these two were the real couple, and that she was no more than a third wheel here.She quickly evicted the thought from her mind and said, \u201cSpeaking of which, I heard that you killed dozens of Assrip Wolves?\u201dZu An was surprised to hear that. \u201cWhere did you hear that from?\u201d\u201cHuanzhao told me about it. She was so gleeful that it almost looked like she was boasting about something incredible.\u201dRecalling the excited look on her younger sister\u2019s face, Chu Chuyan\u2019s lips curled up into a briliant smile. It was almost like the first crack of spring revealing itself before an eternal winter. All of the men that were watching her at that very moment fell into a daze.\u201cOf course. Your hubby is no longer the same person as he used to be. I\u2019ll let you know that I\u2019m quite a formidable figure now!\u201d Zu An replied with a proud expression that was practically screaming \u2018Praise me more! Praise me more!\u2019.Snow burst into laughter. This fellow just can\u2019t stop his bragging, huh?Chu Chuyan, on the other hand, didn\u2019t pay any heed to Zu An\u2019s words. She knew that Zu An had a tendency to boast, so she attributed the matter to Ji Xiaoxi coming up with a white lie to save him from the quandary he was in. Most likely, those Assrip Wolves were already knocked out by Ji Xiaoxi\u2019s poison before the two of them moved on to kill them.\u201cBut speaking of which, how did you get acquainted with Pei Mianman?\u201d Chu Chuyan suddenly recalled a matter and asked.This was the greatest doubt she had in mind at the moment. Given Pei Mianman\u2019s personality, it was impossible for her to offer her help to this fellow.\u201cNaturally, it\u2019s because she was charmed by my looks. She fell in love with me at first sight and lusted over my body!\u201d Zu An couldn\u2019t possibly mention the encounter they had with one another that night, so he simply came up with something on the spot.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Passerby A for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Passerby B for +99 Rage!You have successfully trolled Passerby C for +99 Rage!\u2026Those shameless remarks provoked murmured cursings from Snow and the passers-by.Chu Chuyan was also rendered speechless by Zu An\u2019s shamelessness. She was more inclined to believe that Pei Mianman had helped him in view of their friendship. However, there was still one more matter that didn\u2019t make sense under that explanation.\u201cI heard that you mentioned some night between the two of you back at the academy. What happened?\u201dZu An hesitated a little. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you won\u2019t believe me.\u201dChu Chuyan replied calmly, \u201cHow would you know that if you don\u2019t give it a try?\u201dHearing that, Zu An sighed deeply and said, \u201cThat night, the two of us were hugging tightly with one another, rolling all over the ground. She doesn\u2019t want others to know about that.\u201dChu Chuyan\u2019s face immediately turned cold. \u201cI really don\u2019t like how you spout lies one after another so easily. Does it hurt you to speak the truth for once? It\u2019s one thing for you to run your mouth before me, but if Pei Mianman were to hear those words, you can be sure that she\u2019ll kill you in a heartbeat.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +99 Rage!After saying those words, Chu Chuyan proceeded ahead with a frosty face. Seeing that her young miss had lost her temper, Snow quickly rushed forward to grab Chu Chuyan\u2019s arm before turning her around to direct a gleeful smile at Zu An.Zu An could only sigh deeply to himself. Told you that you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Just what is wrong with this world? Everyone takes my lies at face value, only to doubt all of the truths I reveal!But speaking of which, it sure was difficult to earn his wife\u2019s Rage points. Despite even hinting at an extramarital affair, she was still so stingy as to only give him 99 Rage points. It was almost as if she was really born a glacier mountain.It was then that Zu An realized that the two women were far ahead of him, so he quickly rushed forward to catch up with them.It took a while before Chu Chuyan\u2019s expression finally alleviated a little. She hesitated for a bit before asking, \u201cAre you not having a good time at the Chu Estate?\u201dZu An was surprised by those words. \u201cWhy would you ask that question?\u201d\u201cI heard that you\u2019re planning to buy a residence outside,\u201d Chu Chuyan answered.Zu An suddenly felt something snap in his head.That darned bastard Cheng Shouping! He promised me to keep it a secret, but he still ended up rambling all about it to the entire world! I was still feeling guilty for forgetting to bring him out together with me, especially since I did promise to help him get together with Snow.But now? Eat shit, you twat!\u201cNah, I\u2019m just a little interested in the property market,\u201d Zu An replied sheepishly. He needed her help for what that was going to happen right after, so it wouldn\u2019t do for him to anger her now.Chu Chuyan replied with a nod before falling silent once more. Just like that, the group of three trudged down the streets with nary a word.With nothing much to do, Zu An looked around him and noticed that many of the passers-by couldn\u2019t resist directing a second and third glance at Chu Chuyan, some of their gazes lingering on even after she had passed them. It appeared that his wife\u2019s outstanding disposition and beautiful appearance were almost universally attractive.A while later, the three of them arrived at the entrance of a resplendent-looking store. Zu An turned to Chu Chuyan and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dA huge crowd was constantly entering and leaving the store, a testimony to its good business.Chu Chuyan glanced at the plaque above with the words \u2018Silverhook Casino\u2019 written elegantly, and her face darkened a little. \u201cYou brought me to a gambling den?\u201dZu An nodded. \u201cIndeed.\u201dHe had previously heard that the Plum Blossom Sect was the largest underworld organization in Brightmoon City. Their sources of income included protection fees from the nearby stores and high-interest loans, but their most lucrative business was still no other than their casino.Money was the foundation of all organizations, and most conflicts stemmed from monetary disagreements too. Since the Chu clan was unable to utilize its authority to resolve the problem, he could only wage an economic war against the Plum Blossom Sect and ruined their source of income. If so, the Plum Blossom Sect would be pretty much crippled.However, such a course of action risked severe backlash from the Plum Blossom Sect. If he accidentally riled them up too much, they might just screw it all and make an outright attempt on his life. Thus, he had to bring Chu Chuyan along with him.Given Chu Chuyan\u2019s rank five cultivation and her identity as the First Miss of the Chu clan, the Plum Blossom Sect wouldn\u2019t dare to act too recklessly.It was true that the Chu clan\u2019s hands were tied on many matters, but if someone were to dare hurt their family members, one could be assured that the ducal clan would make its military might known. By then, even if this matter got to the royal court, the Chu clan had nothing to fear.But even though Zu An had it all planned out, it would be for naught if Chu Chuyan refused to cooperate with him. The latter\u2019s face darkened as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that our Chu clan strictly forbids its clan members from engaging in gambling?\u201d\u201cDoes it? Why?\u201d Zu An feigned ignorance.In truth, he was also quite curious as to why the Chu clan had such a rule. There were also noble clans that were very firm on their discipline, but they never went to the extent of outright forbidding gambling.Chu Chuyan answered the question calmly, \u201cOur Chu clan had a patriarch who was obsessed with gambling and nearly gambled the clan\u2019s fortunes away. It took many generations of wise leadership and diligence before the Chu clan finally built itself back up. Nevertheless, our business and fief are still less than half of what they used to be. If not for that, the only dominant power in Brightmoon City would have just been our Chu clan.\u201dZu An nodded in realization. The four major noble clans in Brightmoon City consisted of the Chu clan, Zheng clan, Yuan clan, and Wang clan. The Zheng clan dealt in salt, silk, and potteries; the Yuan clan specialized in arms trade; the Wang clan had taverns and was mostly involved in food industries.While none of them had as high of a noble position as the Chu clan, none of them paled in comparison in terms of fortune.As for the Yu clan, its base of operation wasn\u2019t in Brightmoon City, so it wasn\u2019t taken into account here.After hearing Chu Chuyan\u2019s words, Zu An finally understood that many of the industries that were now taken by the other clans used to be monopolized by the Chu clan. It turned out that the Chu clan had quite an illustrous history after all.\u201cSo, the Chu clan inscribed it into their family rules that no offspring of the Chu clan is allowed to gamble. While you aren\u2019t strictly considered an offspring of the Chu clan, you\u2019re still my husband in name. Needless to say, you need to abide by this rule as well.\u201dA husband in name is still a husband; do you need to emphasize on \u2018in name\u2019 that much?, Zu An retorted.That being said, he had predicted this situation beforehand, and he had a script in place just for this. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here to gamble. I was forced to a corner and had no choice to retaliate in order to protect myself. I believe that the Chu clan doesn\u2019t have a family rule that forbids us from fighting back even when an enemy has climbed over our heads, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since you aren\u2019t able to make a move to help me, I can only help myself then.\u201d\u201cWhat do you intend to do?\u201d Chu Chuyan asked.\u201cIt goes without saying that I\u2019ll earn all of their money!\u201d Zu An said earnestly.Snow sneered at Zu An\u2019s words. \u201cIn the end, isn\u2019t that still gambling?\u201dToward that, Zu An replied, \u201cIt\u2019s only called gambling if there\u2019s risk involved. If we win all of the bets, it\u2019s called \u2018withdrawing money\u2019. The purpose behind why the old patriarchs of the Chu clan forbade its clan members from gambling is so as to ensure that the later generations wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake as before. If they were to know that one of their descendants has married a Gambling God who can win every single bet he made like me, they would surely put a thumbs up in approval!\u201dChu Chuyan harrumphed coldly in response and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no gambler in this world who makes a bet thinking that he would lose his money. Just look at how many people have lost their fortunes from gambling!\u201dZu An took out a money pouch from his robe and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be using the Chu clan\u2019s money. I got this from Plum Blossom Thirteen earlier in the day, so even if I lose, it would just be returning my possessions back to its owner. What do you think about it?\u201dChu Chuyan didn\u2019t respond, seemingly pondering over it. Zu An stared at her for a moment before giving one last push, \u201cSince you have chosen to marry me, you should believe me in a little.\u201dThose words seemed to have struck a chord in Chu Chuyan\u2019s heart. For some reason, she felt that there was something different about Zu An from before. Hm? Why would I have such a ridiculous feeling?It was then that Snow tiptoed to reach up to Chu Chuyan\u2019s ears and whispered, \u201cYoung miss, I think that fellow is determined to enter the casino and gamble. Even if you refuse him now, I reckon that he\u2019ll still come by alone later on. Why don\u2019t you let him finish up his money under your watch so that he\u2019ll drop whatever thoughts he has about buying a house and raising a couple of beautiful maids outside?\u201dChu Chuyan nodded slightly. She found herself agreeing deeply with what Snow said. If Zu An were to really use his money to buy a house outside along with a few pretty maids, what would become of the Chu clan\u2019s reputation and dignity?It was no wonder why they said that men mustn\u2019t be spoilt with money.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll allow it this once. However, I expect you to leave with me once you spend all of your money, or else I won\u2019t hesitate to resort to force,\u201d Chu Chuyan said calmly.Zu An\u2019s face blushed in embarrassment as he looked at Chu Chuyan calmly. \u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to resort to force. You can do whatever you want to do with me; I won\u2019t resist at all.\u201dChu Chuyan harrumphed in response. This fellow always fools around like this.Just as they were about to enter the casino, Snow suddenly clutched her stomach and cried out loud. Chu Chuyan turned over and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe reddened Snow walked over to her side and whispered softly to her. To which, Chu Chuyan nodded in response and said, \u201cGo ahead. Come back and look for us once you\u2019re done.\u201d\u201cAlright. Thank you, young miss.\u201dWatching as Snow jogged away into the distance, Zu An turned to Chu Chuyan and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201dChu Chuyan glared at him impatiently and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a matter among women. Don\u2019t even try to pry into it.\u201d\u201cAlright alright, I won\u2019t pry into it,\u201d Zu An replied with a leisurely smile . He could pretty much guess it even if Chu Chuyan didn\u2019t explain it out loud.Shortly after entering the casino, the two of them turned into the center of attention of everyone\u2019s gaze. Given Chu Chuyan\u2019s outstanding appearance, it simply couldn\u2019t be helped. Her flawless face, graceful silhouette, and her impeccable disposition were all at odds with the crude bustle in the casino.Those who frequented the casinos tended to be boors, and Chu Chuyan\u2019s beautiful appearance stoked their lust. Some of them even began making catcalls.However, there were also plenty of people who recognized her and swiftly stopped their companions from doing anything foolish.\u201cAre you tired of living? That\u2019s the First Miss of the Chu clan over there!\u201d\u201cWoah, it\u2019s no wonder why she\u2019s so pretty! Who\u2019s that gleeful fellow standing beside her then?\u201d\u201cHe must be Chu First Miss\u2019s husband, that wastrel son-in-law.\u201d\u201cHe does look pretty average to me. How did he win Chu First Miss\u2019 fancy?\u201d\u201cI wonder that too. He looks ordinary, just that his face looks a little more handsome and delicate. That kind of man can\u2019t be relied on! If I have to say, masculine men like me are the best!\u201d\u201cGoddamnit! That lucky son of a bitch!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026There were plenty of people who didn\u2019t have a good impression of Zu An, though Zu An was more than overjoyed to accept their offerings of Rage points. He felt that it would be a good idea to frequently go on walks with his wife; he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about having no lack of Rage points if that was the case.If Chu Chuyan were to know of his current thoughts, no matter how kind and patient she was, she would have definitely pummeled him until his cheeks were swollen like a pig\u2019s face.\u201cChu First Miss, what brings you here today?\u201dThe manager of the casino was Plum Blossom Seven. As soon as he received news of Chu First Miss\u2019 arrival, he quickly rushed out with a professional business smile to welcome her. At the same time, he also felt a little uneasy about her presence too.Is she here to deal with the Plum Blossom Sect? I\u2019ve already sent my men to inform the sect master about it, but god knows whether he\u2019ll make it in time or not.At the very least, he had the self-awareness that he didn\u2019t have the means to deal with a rank five cultivator. On top of that, she was the First Miss of the Chu clan as well, which meant that he couldn\u2019t even insult her too. To put it in other words, this was a problem far beyond his means to deal with!Chu Chuyan was clearly unused to this kind of rowdy and crude atmosphere. She lightly fanned off the smoke lingering in front of her with her hand before replying, \u201cYou need not pay any heed to me. I\u2019m accompanying him today.\u201dIt was only then that Plum Blossom Seven noticed Zu An. But again, who would bother looking at a perfectly ordinary man when there was such a gorgeous woman standing before them?\u201cOh, so it\u2019s young master Zu! May I know what business you have with us today?\u201dEven though Plum Blossom Seven had a smile plastered on his face, he was silently cursing Zu An in his mind. This fellow was known to be a wastrel who was inept in both academics and martial arts. It was only due to his shallow appearance that he managed to become a winner in life.This was the kind of man whom he wouldn\u2019t even bother looking at in the past, but right now, he actually had to force a smile and speak politely to him. Damn it, I want to mooch off an woman too!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +200 Rage!Having received Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s offering, Zu An\u2019s lips curled up, and he asked, \u201cAre you cursing me in your mind right now?\u201dPlum Blossom Seven\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly denied it, \u201cNo no, of course not. You\u2019re the young master of the Chu clan, so how would I dare do something that disrespectful to you.\u201dThe implicit meaning behind those words was that \u2018If not for the fact that you\u2019re the young master of the Chu clan, no one will give a damn about you!\u2019.\u201cYoung master Zu, may I know what brings you here today?\u201d Plum Blossom Seven noticed that Zu An was looking around the casino, so he tried to probe him a little.\u201cWhat other reason would I be here for other than to gamble? Do you think that I would come here to eat?\u201d Zu An replied impatiently.Plum Blossom Seven clicked his tongue quietly. You\u2019re only putting on a smug act because you\u2019re faring well now. Would you have dared to talk to me in such a manner in the past, huh?You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +300 Rage!Wait a moment, he\u2019s here to gamble?Realization suddenly struck Plum Blossom Seven, and he turned to look at Chu Chuyan in disbelief. Am I hearing things? A member of the Chu clan is here to gamble, and he even brought Chu First Miss with him?Chu Chuyan remarked nonchalantly, \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m only here to accompany him. You need not look at me.\u201dPlum Blossom Seven quickly turned to Zu An and asked, \u201cYou said that you\u2019re here to gamble?\u201d\u201cAre you that deaf that I need to repeat myself again?\u201d Zu An looked at Plum Blossom Seven in disdain. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t welcome me here?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +99 Rage!However, Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s rage was quickly replaced with frenzied joy. \u201cOf course not! We welcome you with open arms! Come, invite young master Zu to the VIP room!\u201dHe knew that the sect master had tasked Plum Blossom Thirteen to deal with Zu An, but the latter ended up losing his debt note and even got his legs fractured. However, as the culprit was no other than Lu De from Brightmoon Academy, they couldn\u2019t exact vengeance for him.Similarly, Zu An was also the young master of the Chu clan and a student of Brightmoon Academy as well. The Plum Blossom Sect couldn\u2019t afford to touch him without any justification, which left them at a loss as to what to do. Yet, at a moment like this, this fellow actually walked right through their doorsteps!You\u2019re here to gamble?Hah! You must not know what kind of place the casino is like! Even if your family is loaded with money, we\u2019re still able to make you lose everything within a single night!There was no one who didn\u2019t know that the Chu clan forbade its clan members from gambling, and Brightmoon Academy also had rules against that too. While Plum Blossom Seven had no idea what Chu First Miss was doing here, their casino had plenty of tricks up to ensure that Zu An incur an overwhelming debt.By then, they just had to announce it all over town, and it would be all over for Zu An. Without the protection of the Chu clan and the academy, the Plum Blossom Sect would be able to do as they pleased to him!Nay, Brother Thirteen would probably want Zu An all to himself.If only he knew that it was nothing major, he wouldn\u2019t have sent his men to inform the sect master of the matter. It would have been much better to wait for Zu An to be in tens of thousands to silver taels in debt before reporting his accomplishment to the sect leader.Zu An raised his hand and stopped Plum Blossom Seven, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I enjoy the bustle here.\u201d His plan needed plenty of people around as witnesses. The cold and empty VIP room simply wouldn\u2019t do.Meanwhile, at the main headquarters of the Plum Blossom Sect, the crowd was standing respectfully before a green-robed woman.\u201cMiss Qiao, what brings you here today?\u201dIf Zu An was here today, he would surely be able to tell that the green-robed woman was no other than Snow.Snow looked at the woman, who was frantically hiding by one corner while holding her clothes up to cover her body, and remarked coldly, \u201cThere should be a limit to just how lustful you are. You keep her around your side despite having killed her husband; aren\u2019t you afraid of vengeance?\u201dThat woman was the wife of Tan Wei, who was killed by Plum Blossom Twelve back then.Mei Chaofeng burst into hearty laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much, Miss Qiao. I have already conquered both her body and her heart!\u201dThat woman covering her breasts with her clothes lowered her head, seemingly feeling shy at Mei Chaofeng\u2019s words.Snow\u2019s forehead furrowed in disgust, seemingly finding such a topic unpleasant. \u201cI\u2019m here to remind you that Zu An is at Silverhook Casino right now.\u201dMei Chaofeng was stunned. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing at the casino?\u201d\u201cYour brain must have dulled from lust.\u201d Snow looked at him in disdain. \u201cHe\u2019s at the casino to gamble, of course.\u201dHer insult incurred Mei Chaofeng\u2019s wrath. If not for the fact that the young master favors you and gave you the Anyang Token, I would have surely played with you till you can\u2019t close your legs anymore!Of course, he made sure not to reveal his inner thoughts at all. \u201cThat Zu An is nothing more than a fool. He lost a thousand silver taels with us the last time around, and he still hasn\u2019t learned from his lesson yet?\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t get careless. Based on what I\u2019ve heard, it seems like he\u2019s pretty confident this time around. He said that he\u2019s here not to gamble but to withdraw money,\u201d Snow said with a shake of her head.\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Mei Chaofeng burst into hearty laughter, the echoes tremoring the tiles on the roof. \u201cJust what kind of place does he take our Silverhook Casino to be? No matter how rich he is, I have the confidence to make him lose all of his money!\u201dSnow, however, wasn\u2019t very happy with how lightly he was taking this matter.\u201cIt\u2019s still best for you to be careful. He seems to be different from before. I can\u2019t really put my finger on it, but since he dared to boast before Chu Chuyan, I reckon that he has some plan in mind.\u201dMei Chaofeng shook his head.\u201cMiss Qiao, you\u2019re only saying all of this because you\u2019re unfamiliar with how the casino works. Those who have lost big in the casino tend to suffer from what we call Gambler\u2019s fallacy\u2014\u2019Since I\u2019ve already lost so much money, it should be about time to turn things around.\u2019 However, all of them end up losing everything they have, including their wife!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIn any case, you ought to be careful.\u201d Snow felt a lot more assured upon hearing those words. \u201cDo you want to head to the casino to take a look at yourself?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Mei Chaofeng took a huge gulp of wine before continuing on, \u201cPlum Blossom Seven might be weak, but he\u2019s able to rise to such a high position because of his gambling skills. For the past decade, no one has managed to best him yet. Recently, he doesn\u2019t even have to make a move himself anymore. The bunch of underlings he has trained up are able to hold the fort on their own. Nothing can go wrong with him at the Silverhook Casino. You should just patiently wait here for the good news!\u201d\u2026Meanwhile, at the casino, Plum Blossom Seven was standing before Zu An with his back slightly lowered. \u201cYoung master Zu, may I know what you wish to play?\u201dTo be honest, Plum Blossom Seven was disgusted with how subservient he was being, but he knew that his sacrifice would soon pay off. Once this fellow loses all of his money, he would return the humiliation he suffered a hundredfold over.\u201cWhich game is the most dependent on luck?\u201d Zu An took a look around as he asked. The reason why he dared come to this casino to \u2018withdraw money\u2019 was, of course, not because he was some kind of Gambling God. Rather, he had a trusty tool known as the Fortune Pill in his grasp.Some of the goods given out by the keyboard were questionable, but if used appropriately, they could be incredibly formidable. Zu An knew this because he had experienced this for himself.Take the Fortune Pill for example, he was initially planning to use it on the lottery, only to be met with a disclaimer that it didn\u2019t work on it. He was quite disappointed for a long while as he had no idea where else he could put it to good work.It was only till the appearance of Plum Blossom Thirteen that an idea popped into his mind. It was true that skills had great influence over the outcome of a gamble, but the most important factor of all was still no other than luck. Before absolute luck, even the greatest of skills couldn\u2019t do anything.Of course, this was built on the assumption that no one was cheating. Otherwise, even the luckiest person in the world would be scammed of all of his money.And for that reason, he had to bring Chu Chuyan along with him. It was not just out of consideration of his own safety, but to also ensure that the dealers in the casino didn\u2019t cheat.While Chu Chuyan hardly knew anything about gambling, with her rank five cultivation, it was unlikely that the dealers could pull off any tricks beneath her discerning eyes.\u201cThe game that\u2019s most dependent on luck is no other than the Dices Trove!\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen replied with a chuckle.However, the thoughts he had in mind were speaking a very different story. While dices appear to be dependent on luck at first glance, our dealers are skilled enough to roll any numbers we want to. Let\u2019s see how you lose all of your money here!\u201cWhat\u2019s Dices Trove?\u201d Zu An asked.\u201cIt\u2019s just guessing whether the number is \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019,\u201d Plum Blossom Seven replied speechlessly.\u201cThen just say that it\u2019s \u2018Big and Small\u2019. Why do you need to find such a redundant name for it?\u201d Zu An shot a scornful look over.However, Plum Blossom Seven didn\u2019t get angry this time around.Heh, it looks like you don\u2019t even know dices at all. It\u2019s no wonder why you lost 1000 silver taels the last time around. This time, I\u2019ll make sure you lose at least 10,000 silver taels; no, tens of thousands of silver taels! With that, I shall officially retire from business!\u201cHahaha, Zu An! You sure know how to court your own doom!\u201d It was then that an arrogant laughter sounded at the doorstep.Zu An turned around, only to see Plum Blossom Thirteen being pushed in on a wheelchair. The latter\u2019s eyes were red, reflecting his frenzy.Plum Blossom Seven was alarmed by Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s sudden arrival. This fellow! Can\u2019t he hold it in a little? We should first rope Zu An in before doing anything. What do we do if he cowards out and runs away?Zu An, on the other hand, appeared to be delighted to see Plum Blossom Thirteen. \u201cYou should rest at home if you\u2019re injured. If you keep moving around the place, you might just end up breaking your arms too.\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen clenched his jaws so tightly that one couldn\u2019t help but worry for his gums. \u201cYou scoundrel! Now that the teachers of the academy aren\u2019t around to protect you anymore, let\u2019s see how you\u2019ll fare! Men, smash that brat\u2019s arms and legs!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +798 Rage!\u201cYes!\u201dGiven Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s high standing in the Plum Blossom Sect, it was only natural that he would have plenty of subordinates serving under him.As soon as those men began charging at Zu An, he immediately hid behind Chu Chuyan and exclaimed fearfully, \u201cHoney, you see you see! Those fellows dare to act so arrogantly even in your presence! This should be enough to show that I\u2019m not lying to you, right?\u201dChu Chuyan was displeased with how Zu An was calling her \u2018honey\u2019, but with so many people around, it didn\u2019t feel appropriate to correct him. So, she could only vent her rage on Plum Blossom Thirteen. \u201cWhat did you say earlier?\u201dA chilling aura engulfed the surroundings, causing the bustling casino to suddenly fall eerily silent. Many of the gamblers found themselves shuddering inexplicably.Plum Blossom Thirteen was also astonished too. He had rushed here as soon as he heard that Zu An was in the casino, but he didn\u2019t think that Chu Chuyan was here too. Otherwise, he would have never dared to mess around here no matter how brazen he was!That was a rank five expert right there! With the exception of the the sect master, even the whole Plum Blossom Sect combined wouldn\u2019t be a match for her!Plum Blossom Seven immediately stepped forward to mediate in this tense moment. \u201cMiss Chu, it\u2019s a misunderstand! Brother Thirteen was hurt earlier today, so it can\u2019t be helped that he\u2019s a little on the edge today. He got the wrong person here.\u201d\u201cGot the wrong person here?\u201d Chu Chuyan sneered coldly. She turned to Zu An and asked, \u201cHow do you want to deal with him?\u201dZu An was a little surprised by that question. Chu Chuyan was usually very cold to him at home, so he didn\u2019t expect her to show him such respect outside.Overjoyed with the current situation, he pointed at Plum Blossom Thirteen and said, \u201cSince that fellow wanted to break my limbs, let\u2019s return the favor and break his limbs then.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dA white silhouette flitted across the air, and before anyone could react, Plum Blossom Thirteen was already crying out in pain. He fell from the wheelchair and groaned loudly in pain on the floor. From his distorted limbs, one could tell that his arms and legs had been fractured once more. Blood flowed out from his bandaged knee joints.Chu Chuyan returned back to Zu An\u2019s side after carrying out the deed and stood coolly in place. Meanwhile, the others in the casino gasped in horror.Despite her beautiful and graceful appearance, she\u2019s actually such a vicious individual?Those who had catcalled earlier gulped down their saliva as they subconsciously retreated several steps to blend into the crowd.Meanwhile, Zu An shot a thumbs up at Chu Chuyan. As expected of my wife. Straightforward and vicious\u2014ah no, I mean straightforward and pretty.Chu Chuyan turned to Zu An and said nonchalantly, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much into it, I\u2019m not doing this for you. I\u2019m doing this to uphold the Chu clan\u2019s honor.\u201dShe was still harboring some doubts regarding Zu An\u2019s words earlier, but Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s earlier arrogant attitude had affirmed his doubts. Even if Zu An had exaggerated the situation, what he had said was likely to be not too far off from the truth.The Plum Blossom Sect was indeed planning to deal with him!While the Chu clan steered clear of politics so as to not incur the suspicions of the royal court, it wasn\u2019t so weak as to not retaliate when someone had already climbed over its head. The fact that Plum Blossom Thirteen dared to utter such threats toward a member of the Chu clan in her presence was clearly stepping on her bottomline.If I didn\u2019t make a move there, everyone might just think that our Chu clan is a pushover!\u201cIt\u2019s all the same! We\u2019re all from the Chu clan after all!\u201d Zu An remarked gleefully.Chu Chuyan rolled her eyes in response. This fellow\u2019s skin is really as thick as the city walls!Zu An sharply discerned that this was a good chance to reap Rage points, so he ran up to Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s side and gazed down on him from above, saying, \u201cWhat did I say earlier? Since your legs are injured, you should have just obediently recuperated back at home. If you come out and run about, your arms might just get injured. Yet, you took my kind advice for granted and did as you pleased. Haaa, you must be regretting your foolishness right now!\u201dPlum Blossom Thirteen roared at Zu An furiously, \u201cZu An, stop hiding behind others and fight me 1-on-1!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +999 Rage!\u201cHah! Unlike the powerless hoodlum you are, I have connections and backing to rely on. Do you know how precious my body is now? A lowlife like you isn\u2019t worthy of me dirtying my hands over! Besides, why don\u2019t you look at what kind of era we\u2019re in right now? Who still plays 1-on-1 these days?\u201dHoly shit! This level of shamelessness is insane!The surrounding crowd was utterly baffled. You\u2019re also a lowlife just as few days ago, but now, you\u2019re really taking yourself to be a noble, huh?You have successfully trolled Passerby A for +66 Rage!You have successfully trolled Passerby B for +66 Rage!You have successfully trolled Passerby C for +66 Rage!\u2026Putting aside the passers-by, even Chu Chuyan also felt an urge to stifle Zu An\u2019s horrible mouth.Plum Blossom Thirteen finally reached the limit of his patience and bellowed, \u201cPrecious your head! You are just a mooch!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +1000 Rage!\u201cSo what if I am? If you\u2019re that capable, why don\u2019t you find a rich, beautiful, and powerful wife like mine then?\u201d Zu An said as he leisurely wrapped his arms around Chu Chuyan\u2019s shoulders.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +666 Rage!At this point, Plum Blossom Thirteen couldn\u2019t even tell whether he was angry at Zu An\u2019s shamelessness or that he was unable to find a wife like Chu Chuyan.And in fact, Zu An\u2019s gleeful boasting had riled up the surrounding crowd too, who contributed a huge serving of Rage points to him on a platter.Zu An felt that it was a truly wise choice for him to have not gone to the VIP room. Without a crowd to watch the show, how could he earn so much Rage points?Chu Chuyan lightly tilted her body, shaking off Zu An\u2019s arms. With a darkened face, she whispered harshly at him, \u201cShut up! You\u2019re really embarrassing me over here!\u201dThis utter lack of shame had far surpassed her comprehension.So, Zu An walked up to Plum Blossom Thirteen\u2019s side and said, \u201cLook, you angered my wife. Fine, I\u2019ll have a 1-on-1 with you then!\u201d\u201c???\u201d Plum Blossom Thirteen.What? You\u2019re the one who angered her in the first place! Why are you pinning the blame on me?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +666 Rage!Wait a moment, did you say a 1-on-1?Before he could react, the sole of a foot smashed right into his face, causing his nose to bleed profusely.Zu An sighed deeply as he remarked lamentably, \u201cYou cried desperately for me to fight you 1-on-1, and yet, you turned out to be so weak that you can\u2019t even survive a single blow from me? Why must you put yourself through such misery?\u201dSon of a bitch! You only accept my challenge after breaking all my limbs, huh?!Plum Blossom Thirteen had already imagined countless times that if there was no one backing Zu An, he would surely pummel the latter up till shit come spilling out of his guts. Yet, when the opportunity finally arrived, he ended up getting beaten up instead.The sheer frustration and anger from being humiliated by a wastrel ended up knocking him out.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Thirteen for +1024 Rage!Zu An was a little surprised. This was the first time that his Rage points exceeded 1000. Could this be the true upper limit of a person\u2019s rage, or was it just that it was too difficult to exceed this limit?He was still planning to smash a few more kicks onto Plum Blossom Thirteen, but Plum Blossom Seven and the others had already recovered from their daze and rushed forward to stop him.\u201cHe has already passed out. Please let him go.\u201dSomehow, Plum Blossom Seven felt a little awkward saying those words. It had always been their Plum Blossom Sect bullying others, and these were the words usually spoken by those weaklings trying to play the hero. He had never thought that he would be put in such a position one day.This truly is\u2026For the first time in his life, Plum Blossom Seven suddenly found himself doubting whether he was really a bad guy!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +666 Rage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But he insisted that I fought him in a 1-on-1, so there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Who could have known that this fellow was all talk and actually this weak?\u201dThe surrounding gamblers looked at Zu An with a conflicted look on their faces.You\u2019re so good with your mouth that there\u2019s probably no one who is a match for you when it comes to arguing.They really couldn\u2019t understand how this wastrel managed to win First Miss Chu\u2019s fancy. No matter how they looked at it, they didn\u2019t pale in comparison to Zu An in any way. They honestly felt that she should have chosen them instead.However, it was finally dawning on them that there was something that Zu An was superior to them at\u2014the thickness of their skin.Seeing the fuming crowd around, Zu An wondered if he should say a few more words to further agitate them and squeeze some more Rage points from them. However, looking at it from another perspective, he felt that sustainable growth was the true way to go. There was no point squeezing these people dry right away.Thus, he said, \u201cI have a feeling that my luck will be good today. Come, let\u2019s begin.\u201d\u201cOf course! Young master Zu, this way please!\u201d Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s heart blossomed in happiness.I thought that Brother Thirteen\u2019s interference has messed things up, but who could have thought that this fellow would insist on barging right through hell\u2019s gates? Well, since he\u2019s already going this far, I\u2019d be letting him down if I don\u2019t at least squeeze a hundred thousand silver taels out of him!The only thing he needed to be worried about here was Chu First Miss interference. He would have to find an opportunity to lure the latter away, or else she would surely stop him from racking up a debt.The crowd watched intently as Plum Blossom Seven led Zu An to a gambling table. After the earlier spectacle, the other gamblers were curious to see what would happen next, so they gathered around the area to watch the show.Zu An looked at the gambling table before him in interest. He had only seen gambling dens in dramas and movies in his previous life; this was the first time he was seeing it with his own eyes.Different from how he envisioned it to be, there were also many other choices that the players could choose to bet on. Betting \u2018big\u2019 and \u2018small\u2019 were just one of the ways to play the game.Even though Zu An had never played this before, the state of the table was pretty self-explanatory. It didn\u2019t take him long to figure out what was going on.There were three dices in total. If the result ranged between 4 to 10, it would be deemed as \u2018small\u2019. If the result ranged between 11 to 17, it would be deemed as big. The payout was basically 1:1.It was also possible to bet that all three numbers on the dices were the same, and the payout rate was 1:24.For higher-risk players, it was possible to delve even deeper and bet on the specific number when the numbers of all three dices were the same, such as all of the dices being 1 or 2. The payout for that was a hulking 1:150!Alternatively, one could also bet on the sum of the numbers on the three dices. If one chose 4 or 17, the payout would be 1:50. If one chose 5 or 16, the payout would be 1:18. Basically, the easier it was for a number to appear, the lower the payout would be.\u201cYoung master Zu, would you like to bet on big or small?\u201d Plum Blossom Seven asked with a bright smile. In his mind, however, he was concocting the perfect scenario to ensure that Zu An walked out of the casino in heavy debt.Zu An shot a glance at Plum Blossom Seven and asked, \u201cAre you planning on allowing me to win a few rounds first so that I don\u2019t get scared off?\u201dHow did he know?Plum Blossom Seven was stunned. However, the astonishment on his eyes vanished so swiftly that one would have only thought that it was an illusion, and he laughed smoothly, \u201cYoung master Zu, you\u2019re making fun of me. How can we possibly decide the results here? The only thing that influences the outcome on this gambling table is luck.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I should warn you beforehand that my honey is a fifth rank cultivator. If you get caught trying to pull any tricks before her, you shouldn\u2019t complain if your hands get sliced off.\u201d Still feeling a little uneasy about it, Zu An dragged Chu Chuyan over to his side as he threatened Plum Blossom Seven.Chu Chuyan shot a sharp glare at Zu An, dissatisfied with how intimately he was addressing her. However, she couldn\u2019t possibly reveal that they were in a \u2018fake marriage\u2019 before so many people either.On the other hand, Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s smile froze in place. \u201cYoung master Zu, please be assured. With the reputation of our Silverhook Casino, there\u2019s no way we would resort to underhanded tricks. Do you see the inscriptions on our dice shakers? These are artifacts inscribed by a runemaster in the capital. It can isolate a cultivator\u2019s ki, preventing them from reading the results within.\u201dThe other gamblers clicked their tongue in annoyance, knowing full well that there were no casinos that didn\u2019t resort to underhanded tricks. It was true that the inscriptions on the dice shakers prevented cultivators from reading or interfering with the results, but these runes didn\u2019t impede physical interferences. It was likely that there were mechanisms under the table to change the numbers at the last moment.However, it just so happened that it was the common wish of the crowd to see the smug Zu An losing it all, so all of them chose to watch the show without warning him.Plum Blossom Seven, however, knew better than to underestimate the keen sight of a fifth rank cultivator. He knew that it would conceal any tricks he played, which left him feeling a little stifled inside. This was definitely an impediment in his plan, but it wasn\u2019t all over yet.At the very least, he felt that he could make Zu An lose all of his fortune even without resorting to trickery.\u201cYoung master Zu, how much are you planning to bet?\u201d asked Plum Blossom SevenZu An secretly took out the Fortune Pill and swallowed it before saying, \u201cI dislike dragging things out, so it goes without saying that I\u2019m going all in!\u201d\u201cAll in?\u201d Plum Blossom Seven was stunned for a moment.\u201cYou operate a casino but you don\u2019t know what all in means?\u201d Zu An rolled his eyes in disdain. \u201cGoing all in means to throw everything in!\u201dLike hell I wouldn\u2019t know what all in means!, Plum Blossom Seven thought to himself as his smile faltered for a moment. He suppressed his overflowing rage and said, \u201cYoung master Zu sure is a candid man.\u201dAs he said those words, he gestured at the dealer with his eyes. Considering that Zu An was going all in for the first round, they must not screw around with the first round or else that fellow would probably be scared off right away.The dealer received Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s signal. He raised the dice shakers and shook them for a while before finally slamming them down on the table. \u201cPlace your bets!\u201dZu An took out a wad of banknotes and shook it before Plum Blossom Seven. \u201cNow that I think about it, these banknotes are all a gift from Plum Blossom Thirteen. I wonder how much you\u2019re going to give me this time around.\u201dPlum Blossom Seven\u2019s face twitched upon hearing those words. He had already heard about what happened to Plum Blossom Thirteen. You tricked Brother Thirteen and made use of the academy\u2019s teacher to get your way. How can you be so shameless as to claim that it was a gift now?!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +155 Rage!However, this is a good opportunity for me too. Plum Blossom Thirteen is nothing more than a oaf; he thinks that the world revolves around him just because his cultivation is higher. Over the past few years, the sect master has also pinned high expectations on him due to that. However, I shall let the sect master know today that brain is more important than brawn!With such thoughts in mind, the smile on Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s face brightened further as he said, \u201cYoung master Zu, are you going to bet on \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019?\u201dZu An scanned the table leisurely. He could somewhat understand what Plum Blossom Seven was thinking of. It was unlikely that he would screw around with the first round so as to avoid scaring him off. So, regardless of whether he betted \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019, he had a fair chance of winning.But then, how could Zu An possibly be interested in a mere 1:1 payout?He unhesitatingly placed the 1000 silver taels worth of banknotes on 17 points, saying, \u201cWe should go big or go home. That\u2019s how I like to roll!\u201dSeeing how Zu An placed 1000 silver taels down all at once without even batting an eyelid, a slight furrow formed on Chu Chuyan\u2019s forehead. Even if she was no gambler, she knew very well that betting on a single number had a far higher risk than just betting on \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019, especially on 17. One must know the payout for that was 1:50!Why did such a high payout mean? It meant that if you threw a silver tael in, you would lose a silver tael!Chu Chuyan wanted to advise Zu An against it, but on second thoughts, she realized that it wasn\u2019t that bad either. At the very least, he should give up after this, and she would be able to bring him out of here. She didn\u2019t like the smell of this place.\u201cOpen it! Open it!\u201dThe spectating gamblers around began cheering loudly for the dealer to reveal the number. They shared the same thought as Chu Chuyan, and they wanted to see how the showoff would react after losing 1000 silver taels in an instant.It would be best if the Chu First Miss saw her husband\u2019s true colors and realized that he was a wastrel who couldn\u2019t be changed. Perhaps, in her moment of disappointment, they might just stand a chance.For a woman as beautiful as her, they wouldn\u2019t mind that she had been married before.Even Plum Blossom Seven also burst into laughter as well. \u201cYoung master Zu, you\u2019re still too young. You should go slow and steady to make big money. Why don\u2019t you allow our casino to borrow you some money so that you can earn more? Don\u2019t worry, in view of the Chu clan, we won\u2019t charge you any interest!\u201dThat was how they managed to lure Zu An into losing a hulking thousand silver taels the last time. Back then, he was still proceeding carefully, gambling a tael away by a tael. Yet, in just a few days' time, he had gotten so full of himself that he could toss a thousand silver taels away without even batting an eyelid?Gosh, it\u2019s really like a chicken had transformed into a phoenix. Is mooching of women really that lucrative?Maybe I\u2019ve been going about it the wrong way thus far.While Plum Blossom Seven was saying those words, he suddenly sensed that something was amiss around him. The casino had turned deathly silent at some point. The surrounding gambler had turned to look at him with a complicated look in their eyes, seemingly carrying a tinge of\u2026 pity?A fearsome premonition struck Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s heart as he hurriedly turned over to take a look. In the dice shaker, the numbers reflected on the three dices were no other than \u20186\u2019, \u20186\u2019, and \u20185\u2019, which added up nicely to 17 points!An explosion occurred in Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s mind there and then. His mind suddenly blanked out as he struggled to come to terms with what had just happened.A payout of 1:50, their casino had just lost 50,000 silver taels!That was a freaking 50,000 silver taels there!Just thinking about this humongous sum was enough to leave Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s vision blacking out. That was equivalent to half a month of profits for their casino!He shot a ferocious glare at his disciple, wondering if the latter had been bought off by Zu An. However, he soon shook off the possibility. He had investigated the backgrounds of his disciples carefully before taking them in, and he was certain that they were all people who could be trusted.Could Zu An have just been lucky?Zu An waved his hands leisurely with a smile, saying, \u201cHahaha, you brothers sure are kind to me. It was just a moment ago that Plum Blossom Thirteen generously gifted me 800 silver taels, and now you\u2019re giving another 50,000 silver taels. Hahahaha! Time to pay up.\u201dPlum Blossom Seven nearly spurted blood. The hell I am giving you money!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +543 Rage!It was just a moment ago that he was still looking down on Plum Blossom Thirteen for falling prey to Zu An so easily, but who could have thought that a worse fate was awaiting him?No, wait a moment. His tone\u2026 Doesn\u2019t that mean that\u2026\u201cYoung master Zu, are you going to leave now?\u201d Plum Blossom Seven asked anxiously.\u201cWhat else do you think?\u201d Zu An replied with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve already won 50,000 silver taels here. Do I need to continue gambling here?\u201dHe was truly impressed with the effects of the Fortune Pill. To be honest, he wasn\u2019t confident about it at all, but things really worked out in his favor, just as the pill promised.Plum Blossom Seven immediately flew into a fluster. If he were to really allow Zu An to walk away with 50,000 silver taels just like that, the sect master would surely skin him alive!\u201cYoung master Zu, please wait a moment!\u201d Plum Blossom Seven quickly dashed forward to block Zu An\u2019s way, and his henchmen also stepped in to surround the latter with weapons in hand.This made Zu An\u2019s face darken. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m not allowed to leave with the money I\u2019ve earned? Is this how your casino operates?\u201dWhile saying those words, he slyly snuck behind Chu Chuyan and pushed her lightly forward. \u201cHoney, these people are playing punk with us!\u201dChu Chuyan was really not used to having such physical contact with another man, but it wasn\u2019t the right occasion to berate him. So, once again, she could only redirect her anger toward Plum Blossom Seven and the others. \u201cAre you intending to make a move on us?\u201dThe other gamblers also roared in protest as well.It was true that they couldn\u2019t stand how a toad like Zu An managed to latch itself onto a swan like Chu Chuyan, but as fellow gamblers, they couldn\u2019t stand seeing the casino shirking once it had lost. If it could happen to Zu An, it could also happen to them some other day too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, he quickly raised his hand and gestured for his henchmen to back down. Then, with a fawning smile, he said, \u201cMiss Chu, you\u2019re misunderstanding my intention. How could we possibly dare to make an enemy out of you? I apologize for not having disciplined my people well.\u201d\u201cWhy are you blocking our way then? Also, where is my 50,000 silver taels?\u201d Seeing that the danger was over for now, Zu An leaped out once more and demanded arrogantly.Zu An\u2019s smug attitude left Plum Blossom Seven feeling incredibly irritated, and he was starting to understand why Plum Blossom Thirteen would lose his rationality and barge into the casino. This scoundrel was really a despicable scum at his core, a man who possessed no true ability and relied only on the backing of his connections.\u201cThe reputation of our Silverhook Casino isn\u2019t just for show, so of course we\u2019ll pay up. Men, bring young master Zu\u2019s money over!\u201d Despite Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s irritation, he had no choice but to force on a smile with Chu Chuyan around. The more he thought about this matter, the more furious he got.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +344 Rage!In terms of weight, 50,000 silver taels was too heavy to carry around, so for such a large sum of money, the convention was to use banknotes.Plum Blossom Seven had his henchmen pass the banknotes over and said, \u201cYoung master Zu, please keep them well.\u201d50,000 silver taels was, by no means, a small sum of money, but the Silverhook Casino could still afford it. They couldn\u2019t allow their reputation to fall into tatters over this matter.After receiving the money, Zu An began counting every single note one by one, which made Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s face turned even more livid.\u201cYoung master Zu, are you doubting us of underpaying you?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? To be safe, I think I should count my money properly.\u201d As Zu An said those words, he conveniently passed half of it to Chu Chuyan, saying, \u201cHoney, help me count this.\u201dChu Chuyan tilted her body sideward to snub Zu An, not hiding her disgust at the dirty money earned from the casino at all.The other workers in the casino also felt a fiery rage fuming in their minds. Somehow, the act of Zu An counting his winnings before him felt almost as if he was gloating at them, which made them seriously contemplate whether they should heck it all and just smash a fist into his face.Needless to say, this meant yet another wave of Rage points into the system. While each of them contributed a small sum, it was good that there were quite a number of them. Just like that, he earned yet another thousand or so Rage points.\u201cYoung master Zu, are you done counting yet?\u201d Plum Blossom Seven asked with suppressed anger.\u201cOof. I was still counting perfectly well a moment ago, but you suddenly disrupted me, and now I forgot which number I was on.\u201d Zu An flung his hands around exaggeratedly before counting from the start again.\u201c\u2026\u201d Plum Blossom Seven.Where\u2019s my sword?!?!You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +800 Rage!Zu An counted everything once more before remarking with a pleasured sigh, \u201cThe feeling of counting money sure is great.\u201dPlum Blossom Seven, on the other hand, felt his heart bleeding just by looking at the stack of notes in Zu An\u2019s hands. That is our money! Damn it!However, his years of experience as the manager of the Silverhook Casino allowed him to conceal his emotions and maintain a professional smile before his customers. \u201cYoung master Zu, are you intending to leave now?\u201dZu An tilted his head sideward as he assessed Plum Blossom Seven with a sardonic smile. \u201cAre you really intending to stop us? Honey\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, no no no, of course not!\u201d Seeing how Zu An wasn\u2019t hesitant to bring his backing forward in every situation, Plum Blossom Seven secretly cursed him under his breath as he waved his hand hurriedly. \u201cYoung master Zu, please don\u2019t misunderstand me. I just think that since lady luck is on your side today, it would be a waste for you not to play a few more rounds and take back more winnings.\u201dThat suggestion from Plum Blossom Seven brought a frown to Chu Chuyan\u2019s face. It was obviously a ploy from the casino to keep Zu An here so as to have him spit out his winnings.It was a ploy so obvious that she felt that it was unnecessary to warn Zu An about it. Any human being with the slightest semblance of common sense would have seen through it and rejected Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s offer.However, things didn\u2019t go according to how she envisioned it.\u201cI also think that my luck is extraordinarily good today! Since you\u2019re inviting me so sincerely to earn your money, I think that I would be letting you down if I leave just like that. Very well, I\u2019ll play a few more rounds!\u201d\u201cYoung master Zu, this way please!\u201d Plum Blossom Seven was overjoyed. He was really afraid that Zu An would leave just like that.Since you have chosen to stay, I shall make you pay back all of the money you have won out of sheer luck and put you in debt! Otherwise, I shan\u2019t be known as Plum Blossom Seven!Watching as Zu An strutted back to the gambling table without any hesitation, she clenched her fists tightly. This fellow knew that it was a trap, yet he still foolishly leaped right in. It was no wonder why those in the city look down on him so much!You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +233 Rage!Her face had completely darkened by this point. Her opinion of him was just starting to improve after what had just happened earlier, but it turned out that he was still the same wastrel as before.Look like I was expecting too much out of him.Surprisingly, the emergence of this thought alleviated her rage and composed her. She calmly followed Zu An over to the gambling table with hardly any fluctuation in her emotion.For this round, Plum Blossom Seven didn\u2019t feel safe allowing his disciple to deal with the earlier precedence, so he decided to go on the field himself.\u201cOh ho, you\u2019re going to hold the fort personally? Are you that afraid of losing?\u201d Zu An teased.A vein popped out from Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s temples, but he quickly replied with a fawning smile, \u201cOf course not. This fellow seems a bit too nervous at the moment\u2014look at how his hands are trembling! I\u2019m afraid that his inexperience will give you a bad experience. However, you need not worry. With lady luck shining on you today, I have faith that you\u2019ll do well.\u201dNeedless to say, these words didn\u2019t reflect his true thoughts.Luck? Hah! Those who depend on luck in the casino already have their wives sold to brothels!\u201cWell well, aren\u2019t you a smooth talker! I\u2019ll take your well wishes. Let\u2019s start then,\u201d Zu An replied with a smile.\u201cHow much do you intend to bet this time around, young master Zu?\u201d Plum Blossom Seven asked probingly.Zu An waved his hand and replied grandly, \u201cDo you even need to ask? I\u2019m going all in! A true man should be decisive and charge right in!\u201dThose words made Chu Chuyan shake her head, but she didn\u2019t speak up to stop him. The other gamblers were also shaking their heads too. They had seen plenty of such people in the casino over the years\u2014they get ahead of themselves as soon as they earn a bit of money, and they eventually end up losing it all back to the casino.Most gamblers carried a mentality where they couldn\u2019t stand to see others faring well when they were faring badly themselves. They decided to just watch the show quietly by the side and wait for Zu An to lose all of his money.It went without saying that Plum Blossom Seven was more than delighted about the current circumstances. \u201cYoung master Zu sure is direct!\u201dHe was still worried that Zu An would play careful after his huge killing. It would be troublesome if the latter were to back out before he could lose all 50,000 silver taels. However, since the other party was betting everything on this single round, he would at least still be able to face the sect master even if he couldn\u2019t get the other party in debt.But all of a sudden, Zu An said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be planning to cheat, right?\u201dPlum Blossom Seven nearly choked on the sudden accusation. He quickly waved his hands and assured, \u201cLook at how many veterans there are in here; I would never dare to cheat before them! Besides, Chu First Miss is watching by the side too. There\u2019s no way I would be able to fool her if I attempt something.\u201dThe payment ratio was set in favor of the casino. It was extremely difficult to beat the odds, such that one was almost guaranteed to lose in the long-run. Even if one won a few matches now and then, the chances were that one would leave the casino with a loss.Zu An nodded his head. \u201cVery well, hurry up and shake the dices.\u201dPlum Blossom Seven sneered coldly as he began shaking his hands with great dexterity, such that he was actually leaving after shadows in the wake of his movements. It brought about awed exclamations from the crowd.While Plum Blossom Seven wasn\u2019t particularly strong compared to the other godsons of the sect master, he still managed to get to his current positions on the grounds of his superior gambling skills itself.As long as he willed so, he could get any number he wanted.He decided to shake out a triple, which allowed him to win all bets, regardless of whether one betted \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019 or a specific number. The only chance to win was if Zu An betted on triple, which was extremely difficult to win given the odds.While shaking halfway through, Plum Blossom Seven suddenly hesitated. What if that fellow somehow wins the bet staking all in?One must know that betting on triple had a payout ratio of 1:150, which meant that he would owe Zu An 7,500,000 silver taels. Even if they sold the entire Plum Blossom Sect, they wouldn\u2019t be able to raise that much money!However, looking at it from another perspective, it should be impossible for Zu An to win. There were six different kinds of triples, so even if Zu An wanted to bet on triple, his chances of winning were still limited to only a sixth.What am I so afraid of?Plum Blossom Seven reassured himself as he finally slammed the dice shaker on the table. He looked at Zu An and smiled, \u201cYoung master Zu, please place your bets.\u201dHis gaze was almost saying \u2018Come and deliver your money right over\u2019.However, Zu An was in no rush to proceed on. He first turned to look at Chu Chuyan, to which, the latter replied, \u201cRest assured, he didn\u2019t cheat here.\u201dConsidering the disparity in their cultivation\u2014Chu Chuyan was at rank five whereas this fellow was only at rank two or so\u2014there was no way Plum Blossom Seven would be able to hide any tricks from her.However, Zu An shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not asking you that. I\u2019m asking you if you have any copper coins on hand.\u201d\u201cCopper coins? What do you need that for?\u201d Chu Chuyan was confused.She was in-charge of the Chu clan\u2019s businesses, so she would usually bring some spare money around with her in case of emergencies. At Zu An\u2019s question, she took out a single copper coin from her coin pouch.\u201cLend it to me for a moment.\u201d Zu An took the copper coin from her hand before leaning over to whisper in her ears, \u201cHelp me blow on it.\u201dChu Chuyan\u2019s face immediately turned cold. \u201cStop messing around.\u201dZu An insisted with a chuckle. \u201cJust help me this once. As long as you give it a wisp of your divine air, I promise you that I\u2019ll be able to win this bet.\u201d\u201cBlow it! Blow it! Blow it!\u201dThe gamblers in the room loved commotions, so they began chanting in unison.With all eyes on her, Chu Chuyan found herself put in a spot. So, she could only blow softly onto the copper coin. A slight tinge of redness colored her fair cheeks. She told herself that she would surely settle this score with Zu An later on.Feeling a slight wind tickling his fingers, Zu An smiled in satisfaction. \u201cAlright, with my wife\u2019s divine air on my side, I\u2019m certain that I\u2019ll be able to win this bet. I shall bet on wherever this copper coin falls on!\u201dRight after saying those words, he flicked the copper coin up into the sky. Everyone watched with bated breaths as the copper coin fell on the gambling table and rolled around. Even Chu Chuyan was unable to tear her gaze away.Her original intention was to just watch the show by the side, but Zu An\u2019s earlier act of asking her to blow on the coin ended up drawing her into the show, turning her into a participant too.Her heart, which had remained calm since many years ago, actually began to hasten for once. She found herself incredibly curious as to what the result of the bet would be like.The copper coin continued to roll and roll until it finally struck the edge of the gambling table, which knocked it back a little before finally falling flat on the box indicating \u20181-1-1\u2019.With a hearty peal of laughter, Zu An placed all of his 50,000 silver taels worth of banknotes onto the box, saying, \u201cSince destiny has decreed so, I shall stake all of my money here!\u201d\u201cOpen it! Open it! Open it!\u201dAll of the gamblers around found themselves desiring to know the results of the match. Needless to say, they were all praying for Zu An\u2019s loss. This man actually dared to flirt with his wife in the middle of the match. How abominable!On the other hand, Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s face distorted in horror. How could this be possible?His mind went completely blank at this very instant. He couldn\u2019t hear any of the commotions around; all he saw was mouths opening and closing in front of him, seemingly shouting something at him.\u201cHm?\u201dSeeing how the dealer wasn\u2019t opening the dice shaker, the gamblers realized that something was amiss. This brat can\u2019t be that lucky as to have really guessed it, can he?\u201cPlum Blossom Seven, why aren\u2019t you opening the dice shaker?\u201d\u201cHurry up and open it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He swallowed a mouthful of saliva as he cursed himself for being so foolish as to actually roll a triple. If he had gotten any number instead, he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly.He could already imagine how tragic of a plight he would be in.That\u2019s 7,500,000 silver taels! We wouldn\u2019t be able to raise that much money even if we sell all of the Plum Blossom Sect\u2019s businesses!The sect master will really dice me and feed me to the dogs!Just thinking about the pitiful plight awaiting him, Plum Blossom Seven toughened his resolution and discreetly slipped his hand beneath the table. There was a mechanism there which, once pushed, could change the result of the dices.Given the current circumstances, he could only take a gamble and pray that Chu Chuyan wouldn\u2019t notice it.It was only unfortunate that he couldn\u2019t comprehend just how powerful a rank five cultivator was. It wasn\u2019t a gamble at all but guaranteed failure. As soon as his hands started moving, he suddenly found himself shrouded by a white aura, and at the next moment, his entire hand froze up. He couldn\u2019t move it anymore.\u201cWhat are you trying to do over there? Cheat?\u201dOne must know that Chu Chuyan had been keeping a tight eye here, especially since she had \u2018participated\u2019 in this gamble too. She couldn\u2019t possibly allow anyone to tamper with the results.Zu An sighed deeply and said, \u201cI warned you not to cheat, but you wouldn\u2019t listen to me. You over there, open it!\u201dHe casually pointed to one of Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s disciples and ordered him.\u201cOpen it! Open it! Open it!\u201dThe eyes of the gamblers around had turned red in agitation. Will we be seeing a miracle today?Plum Blossom Seven, on the other hand, was utterly panicked. He was just about to say something when he suddenly felt a pressure crushing down on him, preventing him from speaking a single word.The disciple pointed out by Zu An was hesitant. He looked around fearfully, but there was no one here for him to rely on. In the end, he stretched his trembling hand forward to remove the cap from the dice shaker to reveal three brilliant red dots pointing upward.There was a moment of silence before an utter uproar broke out.Even Chu Chuyan\u2019s breathing hastened too!At a payout ratio of 1:150, that made a hulking sum of 7,500,000 silver taels! What did that mean?The Chu clan was known for its humongous wealth that could rival the country\u2014its salt and arms businesses were bringing it huge amounts of money every single day\u2014but even so, its annual profits didn\u2019t come close to this amount.They wouldn\u2019t earn that much if they were to save up three years of profits!Zu An looked at Plum Blossom Seven gleefully as he said, \u201cThanks a lot. If not for you stopping me earlier, I could have just walked away with only 50,000 silver taels. I never thought that I would actually end up winning 7,500,000 silver taels here. I must say, your mouth really brings me good luck! Alright, here\u2019s 10 silver taels as a tip for you. You can use it to buy yourself a cup of tea or something to quench your thirst.\u201dThose words reminded Plum Blossom Seven of how he desperately tried to keep Zu An here. Just the recollection of it made him feel like an utter fool. It turned out that he was the one who had brought about his own downfall!The slight gleam coming from the 10 silver taels seemed to be mocking him for his naivety. Unable to take it anymore, he spurted a mouthful of blood and collapsed to the ground.You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for +1024 Rage!However, his collapse only spurred Zu An\u2019s displeasure. \u201cHey hey hey, don\u2019t think that you can escape from this just by fainting. You, come here and settle the debt!\u201dJust like how Chen Daozai was able to earn 27,000,000 HKD with just 20 HKD, I, Zu An, have earned 7,500,000 silver taels with just 1000 silver taels today! Converted into the currency of my previous world, that would be 13,500,000,000 RMB!This is what being the God of Gambling means!\u2026Meanwhile, over at the headquarters of the Plum Blossom Sect, Mei Chaofeng was laughing leisurely as he said, \u201cSay, Miss Qiao, you really need not worry so much. From the moment that trash decided to enter the Silverhook Casino, he\u2019s already in my grasp! It\u2019s impossible for anything to go wrong! Once he rakes up a debt of tens of thousands of silver taels, you can be assured that there would no longer be a place for him in the Chu clan anymore.\u201d\u201cIndeed. The Chu clan is extremely strict on its clan members, not to mention that Madame Chu has never had a high opinion of her useless son-in-law. Let alone tens of thousands, even if he just made a loss of several thousands, I reckon that Madame Chu would do everything she could to evict him from the household!\u201d Snow nodded in agreement.\u201cThe only problem we\u2019re facing right now is that Chu First Miss. She wouldn\u2019t stand still as he rakes up a huge debt. Miss Qiao, may I ask you to head over there and find a way to distract her? We need to lure her off first before our brothers in the casino can work on Zu An,\u201d said Mei Chaofeng.Snow shook her head in response. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky. Chu First Miss already carries some suspicions toward me. If I lure her off at this juncture, I\u2019ll surely give my identity away. We can\u2019t mess everything up just to deal with Zu An.\u201dMei Chaofeng nodded a little before bursting into laughter. \u201cIndeed. Only with Miss Qiao keeping an eye on Chu First Miss and ensuring that she doesn\u2019t get sullied by any men will the young master be able to rest easy.\u201dSnow\u2019s face immediately turned cold. \u201cDon\u2019t gossip about the young master behind his back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just joking, I\u2019m just joking!\u201d Mei Chaofeng replied with a laugh. On the inside, however, he was getting a little irritated by how rudely Snow was talking to him. A mere lass like you dares to act big just because you have the young master\u2019s favor. Hmph! It\u2019s only a matter of time before I get the young master to betroth you to me. By then, I\u2019ll have you know the results of daring to offend me!Snow stood up and looked at the direction of the gambling den. She recalled all of the bickers she had with Zu An over the last few days, and a hint of worry flickered across her eyes. \u201cWhy do I have an ominous feeling about this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re worrying too much! That wastrel can\u2019t possibly pull off anything!\u201d Mei Chaofeng replied casually, thinking to himself that women sure liked to worry about useless stuff. \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, it should be around time for us to receive news of our success.\u201dRight after he said those words, footsteps suddenly sounded outside. A sect member rushed over while shouting anxiously, \u201cSect master, b-bad\u2026!\u201dMei Chaofeng\u2019s face immediately darkened. \u201cWho are you calling bad? Slap your own face!\u201dThe sect member was stunned, but out of fear of Mei Chaofeng, he immediately kneeled down and slapped himself viciously without any protest.Meanwhile, Mei Chaofeng leisurely picked up his teacup and blew on it lightly. \u201cRemember, don\u2019t act in such an uncultured manner in the future.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d The sect member felt wronged, but he dared not to refute the sect master\u2019s words.Mei Chaofeng finally nodded his head in satisfaction. \u201cSpeak, what happened.\u201dThe sect member finally began reporting the issue on hand, \u201cIt was a loss of 50,000 silver taels.\u201d\u201c50,000?\u201d Mei Chaofeng burst into laughter. It wasn\u2019t as much as he imagined it out to be, but Plum Blossom Seven still did great this time around. One had to consider the fact that he had done it right under the eyelids of Chu First Miss. \u201c50,000 silver taels should be enough to get Zu An kicked out of the Chu clan.\u201dA hint of a smile also emerged on Snow\u2019s lips. She also agreed that 50,000 silver taels would be enough. As long as she fanned the matter a little, she was certain that Madame Chu would surely come to the limit of her tolerance with that fellow and kick him off.On the other hand, the sect member realized that his words had been misinterpreted, so he anxiously clarified, \u201cSect master, I meant that we lost 50,000 silver taels!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Mei Chaofeng\u2019s smile suddenly froze in place. His eyes slowly turned back to the sect member, reflecting killing intent in them. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dThe sect member had no choice but to suppress his fear and repeat the matter once more, \u201cIt was the Silverhook Casino who has lost 50,000 silver taels to the young master of the Chu clan.\u201dBam!The teacup in Mei Chaofeng\u2019s hands immediately shattered into pieces as he flew into a state of rage. \u201cWhat the hell is Plum Blossom Seven doing? How could he lose that much money to that wastrel? Even if I were to put a pig on the gambling table, it wouldn\u2019t be so inept as to lose 50,000 silver taels!\u201d\u201cActually, it was all lost in a single round,\u201d reported the sect member.\u201cIn a single round?\u201d Surprised to hear that, Mei Chaofeng quickly enquired what was going on. The sect member quickly filled him in on the details.After hearing the full story, Mei Chaofeng fell into silence, but his complexion clearly alleviated significantly. With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the sect member before leisurely returning back to his chair to sip on yet another cup of tea.Snow couldn\u2019t stand how Mei Chaofeng remained unmoved despite having heard about the accrued loss, so she stood forth and asked, \u201cWhy are you still sitting down here, sipping on your tea? Aren\u2019t you going to head there to take a look? You\u2019ve already lost 50,000 silver taels!\u201d\u201cNo rush,\u201d Mei Chaofeng replied calmly. \u201cMiss Qiao, don\u2019t let your anxiety get ahead of yourself.\u201d\u201cHow can I not be anxious? You won\u2019t be able to take responsibility for ruining the young master\u2019s plans!\u201d Snow pointed out coldly.Mei Chaofeng clenched his fists furiously upon hearing how Snow was using the young master\u2019s name to threaten him, but he quickly composed himself and explained, \u201cIf Plum Blossom Seven has lost 50,000 silver taels after a series of bets, without a doubt, there\u2019s indeed a problem here. However, just as you have heard, they had only gambled for a single round. It\u2019s obvious that Zu An was simply lucky.\u201cLuck could save him once, but it won\u2019t save him every time. Rest assured, Plum Blossom Seven will earn the money back very soon and place Zu An in debt.\u201d\u201cWhat if Zu An refuses to continue gambling?\u201d asked Snow with a frown.To that question, Mei Chaofeng burst into laughter. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that many people like him over the years. They lose themselves as soon as something good comes their way. He doesn\u2019t have the wisdom to stop while he\u2019s ahead. Besides, Plum Blossom Seven is there. Even if Zu An doesn\u2019t want to continue gambling anymore, he would have ways to keep him there in the casino. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have placed him in charge of the casino.\u201d\u201cYou seem to trust Plum Blossom Seven a lot?\u201d asked Snow.\u201cOf course! He\u2019s one of my most trusted aides.\u201d Mei Chaofeng revealed a hint of gleefulness. \u201cI have nurtured quite a few talents over the last few years. Just wait and see, good news should be coming in very soon.\u201dIt was then that flurried footsteps sounded by the doorway. Mei Chaofeng pointed over and remarked with a laugh, \u201cSee what I just said? Looks like they\u2019re here now.\u201dA slight smile slowly surfaced on Snow\u2019s face too. It looks like the Plum Blossom Sect is still quite reliable after all.Soon, a sect member scrambled into the room with a completely pale face. He rushed all the way toward Mei Chaofeng and exclaimed pantingly, \u201cR-report\u2026 Lost\u2026 Lost 7,500,000 silver taels!\u201dMei Chaofeng\u2019s face immediately darkened. \u201cWhat do I always tell you? Why do none of you ever learn? If you can\u2019t even keep your composure, you\u2019ll never be able to achieve great things!\u201dIt was then that Mei Chaofeng suddenly jolted a little, and he asked with a sharper tone, \u201cHm? What did you just say?\u201d\u201c7\u2026 7,500,000 silver taels\u2026\u201d reported the sect member once more.Ravenous joy broke out on Mei Chaofeng\u2019s face. \u201cHahaha, 7,500,000 silver taels! That brat is done for! Even if the Chu clan sells all of its properties, it won\u2019t be able to raise that much money!\u201dIt\u2019s no wonder why my sect member is so agitated!Mei Chaofeng had already forgiven his subordinate for his breach of etiquette. Even he could hardly keep his calm hearing such a shocking number.Snow was astonished too. \u201cThat fellow actually lost 7,500,000 silver taels?\u201dIt was beyond her imagination to fathom how a person could lose so much money within such a short period of time.However, her heart was put at ease as well. There might still be a small probability that the Chu clan would clean up after Zu An if it was just tens of thousands of silver taels, but a debt as huge as 7,500,000 silver taels was indubitably out of question.Putting aside just the Chu clan, even if one were to throw in the Yuan clan, Zheng clan, and Wang clan as well, they might still be unable to raise such a huge amount of money.Mei Chaofeng poured a cup of wine and passed it to Snow. \u201cMiss Qiao, your mission has been successfully accomplished.

Once I\u2019m back at the young master\u2019s side, I\u2019ll make sure to speak to him on your behalf.\u201dMei Chaofeng laughed heartily. \u201cYes, may we have a pleasant partnership!\u201dWatching as the duo before him was clinking their glasses together in celebration, the sect member finally understood that his words had been misunderstood. With an almost tearful voice, he clarified nervously, \u201cSect master, it\u2019s not Zu An who lost 7,500,000 silver taels. We are the ones who owe him 7,500,000 silver taels!\u201dMei Chaofeng was in the midst of celebrating his victory when he heard those words. Those hands that had never trembled while taking the lives of others jolted sharply, causing a wine cup to fall to the ground and shatter into pieces.Snow also found his mind blanking out too. Even with her wildest imaginations, she couldn\u2019t begin to fathom how things had come to this point.\u201cRepeat that again.\u201d Mei Chaofeng\u2019s complexion looked incredibly awful. Given his high cultivation, it was almost impossible for him to mishear anything. Never once had he asked his subordinate to report a single matter twice, but what he was hearing was simply too inconceivable that he had to verify it once more.\u201cZu An has won 7,500,000 silver taels in the Silverhook Casino. Master Seven has already fainted, and the brothers in the casino are in a complete fluster. Sect master, please hurry to the casino to hold the fort!\u201d the sect member cried out anxiously.Mei Chaofeng found himself petrified in place.7,500,000 silver taels. Just how much money was that?Putting aside the Plum Blossom Sect, even the nearby municipalities combined didn\u2019t earn that much money in their annual taxes!Over! It\u2019s all over!Mei Chaofeng found his legs trembling so hard that even remaining standing was difficult. With a slight sway, he stumbled back onto the chair behind him.Snow, on the other hand, was still a little calmer. She anxiously asked the sect member, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How could Zu An earn so much money?\u201dThe sect member was a little surprised to see that there was such a ravishing young woman in the sect master\u2019s room. Even though her face was concealed by a veil, her shapely figure and eyes were more than enough to hint at her beauty. However, this was no time for him to be appreciating the looks of another person.\u201cHe first staked all of his money on 17 points, which has a payout ratio of 1:50, earning him 50,000 silver taels. After that, he betted all of his money on triple 1, and with its payout ratio of 1:150, he won 7,500,000 silver taels right away.\u201dMei Chaofeng finally recovered from his daze. As if a ferocious lion, he leaped out of the chair, bolted forward, and grabbed the sect member by his collar. \u201cHow could that wastrel possibly get it right? The possibility of it happening is so small\u2026 Did he cheat?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d The sect member found his entire body turning numb in fear. He was afraid that the sect master would snap his neck in a fit of rage. \u201cNo one would possibly be able to cheat before us in the Silverhook Casino. That\u2019s why all of our brothers are spooked by this matter.\u201dIt was then that Snow spoke up, \u201cCould it be that First Miss Chu has sensed the revolutions in the dices and secretly whispered the answer to him?\u201dTo be honest, Snow didn\u2019t really believe that to be the case either. She couldn\u2019t imagine Chu Chuyan participating in a gamble, let alone helping that wastrel.Mei Chaofeng shook his head adamantly. \u201cImpossible. Our dice shakers have formations inscribed by a renowned runemaster in the capital. It\u2019s able to isolate ki, preventing anyone from peeking into the dice shakers. Even a Grandmaster wouldn\u2019t be able to read the results of the dice shakers, let alone a fifth rank cultivator! Otherwise, casinos in this world would have long gone bankrupt by now!\u201dSnow sighed deeply and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no point speculating here. We should hurry to the scene and take a look ourselves.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026\u201d Mei Chaofeng was still a little panicked a moment ago, but Snow\u2019s words allowed him to regain his composure a little. \u201cRelay my orders. All of our brothers are to follow me to the Silverhook Casino right now!\u201dHe had already made up his mind.Pay up? That\u2019s a sum of money that I\u2019ll never be able to fork out even if I work my entire life!That\u2019s 7,500,000 silver taels! I won\u2019t be able to raise that much money even if I sell everything in the Plum Blossom Sect!Mei Chaofeng had already made up his mind to shirk off this debt even if he had to fall out with the Chu clan.The Plum Blossom Sect\u2019s headquarters wasn\u2019t too far away from the Silverhook Casino. The anxious Mei Chaofeng flitted all the way there, so it didn\u2019t take him long to arrive at the casino.A huge crowd of people had already gathered outside by now. Upon hearing that someone had managed to earn 7,500,000 silver taels, the curious passers-by began gathering around the area to watch the commotion.It took quite a bit of effort for Mei Chaofeng to squeeze his way through. A pandemonium had already broke out in the casino by now, and the onlookers were chanting loudly, \u201cPay up, pay up, pay up~\u201dHoh, they have a good sense of rhythm.Zu An was currently sitting leisurely on a chair that someone had moved here for him, and his legs were resting arrogantly on the gambling table. The surrounding crowd had delivered a cup of tea to him, and some of them were massaging his back and legs. What was even more exaggerated was that there were maids around plucking grapes out one by one to feed him.Mei Chaofeng was rendered utterly speechless at that sight. He could tell that those servants and maids serving Zu An at the moment were reserved specially for guests in the VIP room, and yet, they were all waiting on that wastrel?Are you trying to start a mutiny here? At least poison the goddamned grapes he\u2019s eating!You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +400 Rage!Upon seeing the inflow of Rage points, Zu An waved his hands and said, \u201cShoo shoo, open up a way.\u201dHe pushed the people before him aside and found himself looking face-to-face with a livid Mei Chaofeng.\u201cYou must be Sect Master Mei. Since you\u2019re here, I\u2019d have to ask you to hurry up and pay me my earnings. It\u2019s 7,500,000 silver taels in total~\u201d Zu An stretched his hand forth and demanded.Chu Chuyan was still standing by one side with a look of disdain subconsciously walked a little closer to Zu An. Mei Chaofeng was known to be a vicious figure who had ruled over Brightmoon City\u2019s underworld in the recent years. Many innocent lives had been lost in his hands.Zu An\u2019s words made Mei Chaofeng\u2019s cheeks twitch. How in the world can I raise 7,500,000 silver taels for you?Seeing how Mei Chaofeng wasn\u2019t saying a word at all, Zu An sighed softly and continued, \u201cSect Master Mei, you can be considered a distinguished individual in Brightmoon City. Surely you aren't thinking of shirking off your debt, are you? You should know that there are a lot of eyewitnesses here.\u201d\u201cIndeed! Pay up, pay up~\u201dThe surrounding crowd cheered loudly. There were so many of them around right now, and First Miss Chu was here to back them up too. There was no need for them to fear the Plum Blossom Sect here!Their only regret was not betting together with Zu An, or else they would have made a huge killing too.If they could do it all over again\u2026 well, it was still unlikely that any of them would have the guts to bet on triple 1, which had an extremely low chance of rolling out.Mei Chaofeng first took in a deep breath to calm himself down before saying, \u201cThere are too many people here to talk things out. Why don\u2019t we proceed inward to discuss the matter thoroughly?\u201dYet, who could have thought that Zu An would turn down his request. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly fine to discuss things here. Everyone is so warm-hearted here, and they say pleasant words. I love it here. As the saying goes, a gentleman has nothing to hide from others. Sect Master Mei, feel free to speak here.\u201dYou must be joking with me! How am I supposed to earn Rage points from everyone else if I discuss things with you in private?On the other hand, Mei Chaofeng didn\u2019t expect Zu An to snub his request. This bastard!You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +631 Rage!\u201cVery well. Since young master Zu wishes to talk things out here, let\u2019s do it then.\u201d Mei Chaofeng\u2019s years of ruling the underworld weren\u2019t just for show. It didn\u2019t take him long for him to adjust his state of mind. \u201cSince young master Zu\u2019s luck is so good here, why don\u2019t you have another gamble?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure what was going on here. Regardless of whether Plum Blossom Seven and the others had betrayed him or that Zu An was really that lucky, it all would unravel now that he was going to make a move personally. He was confident that no one could pull any tricks before him.Just like how Zu An had won 7,500,000 silver taels from him, he was confident that he could win it back.Everyone thought that Plum Blossom Seven was the number one gambler in the Plum Blossom Sect, but they forgot the fact that it was Mei Chaofeng who had imparted the knowledge to him. On top of that, if one were to consider the difference in cultivation as well, there was no way Plum Blossom Seven would stand a chance against Mei Chaofeng in a gambling match.It was just that Mei Chaofeng had risen to a position where he didn\u2019t have to manage the casino personally anymore.What if Mei Chaofeng lost the bet?For one, Mei Chaofeng didn\u2019t think that he would lose. Also, it was not as if anything would change if he were to lose the bet. What was the difference between owing 7,500,000 silver taels and 10,000,000 silver taels? He couldn\u2019t pay up anyway.Desperate times call for desperate measures indeed.Upon hearing Mei Chaofeng\u2019s invitation, Chu Chuyan grew a little anxious. She could ensure that Plum Blossom Seven wasn\u2019t able to pull anything before her, but the same didn\u2019t apply for Mei Chaofeng. Just like her, Mei Chaofeng was a rank five cultivator, and he was clearly much more experienced than her. It was likely that she wouldn\u2019t be able to see through him if he were to resort to dirty tricks.So, she immediately walked over to Zu An to remind him not to accept the bet. After all, the latter was a really hot-headed person. He even fell for Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s provocation so easily; it would really be the end if he were to accept Mei Chaofeng\u2019s invitation in a spur of recklessness.Surprisingly, before she could say a word, Zu An had already waved his hand to turn down the invitation. \u201cWhy would I gamble with you? I have already won 7,500,000 silver taels! Besides, I reckon that you\u2019d have difficulties trying to fork out the 7,500,000 silver taels in the first place; you wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me even if I won anything else from you. Do you really take me for an idiot? Cut the crap and pay up! I\u2019m still waiting to return home to embrace my honey in bed!\u201dEven if Mei Chaofeng had the money, he wouldn\u2019t continue gambling anymore. Quite a while had passed since he ate the Fortune Pill, so it was almost time for its effects to run out.Zu An\u2019s words brought a relieved smile to Chu Chuyan. This fellow looks reckless, but he isn\u2019t a fool after all.However, she soon heard the latter half of Zu An\u2019s sentence and her smile immediately froze on the spot.You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +199 Rage!Meanwhile, the gamblers gathered around were starting to feel deeply envious too. It was just half a month ago that Zu An was still a wastrel that they looked down on. Yet, in the blink of an eye, he suddenly won 7,500,000 silver taels, a wealth that they dared not even imagine! Not to mention, he even married such a beautiful wife. This was the literal definition of \u2018winner in life\u2019!I know that you are gleeful about it, but do you need to keep flaunting it before us?Just the thought of Zu An having his way with the ravishing Chu First Miss sent their blood gushing into their heads. They were just here to watch the commotion, but all of a sudden, they felt that it wouldn\u2019t be too bad of an idea for Mei Chaofeng to strangle the neck of that darned scoundrel.You have successfully trolled Gambler A for +77 Rage!You have successfully trolled Gambler B for +77 Rage!You have successfully trolled Gambler C for +77 Rage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An joyfully reaped his share of Rage points as he once again affirmed his wisdom for not agreeing to have a private discussion with Mei Chaofeng.The triumphant look on Zu An\u2019s face made Mei Chaofeng grit his teeth in anger.Just a month ago, this trash wasn\u2019t even worthy of standing before me. Even my underling could have him lowering his back respectfully.Yet, in just a few days' time, he\u2019s actually standing before me as an equal, not to mention, he even dares to threaten me so openly?Shit! I should have also pimped myself out too while I was younger!You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +666 Rage!Mei Chaofeng took in another deep breath to compose himself before beckoning to his subordinates. \u201cMen, bring Plum Blossom Seven over!\u201dSoon, his subordinates brought an utterly horrified Plum Blossom Seven over. As soon as Plum Blossom Seven saw Mei Chaofeng, he immediately dropped to his knees and hugged Mei Chaofeng with tears and snot flowing down his face as he cried pitifully, \u201cGodfather, I have let you down! I didn\u2019t expect to bring such huge trouble to you!\u201dHowever, without bothering to spare a glance at Plum Blossom Seven, he kicked the latter off and remarked coldly to Zu An, \u201cThe earlier gamble was conducted under Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s own discretion. It doesn\u2019t represent our casino. If you want money, get it from him. In view that Plum Blossom Seven has flouted the rules of our sect and brought about negative publicity, I hereby declare that he\u2019s permanently expelled from the Plum Blossom Sect!\u201d\u201cGodfather! Sect master! You can\u2019t treat me like that! I have worked hard for you over the years\u2026\u201d Plum Blossom Seven immediately understood that he was going to be abandoned, and that left him in a fluster. He didn\u2019t even have the ability to fork out 10,000 silver taels, let alone 7,500,000 silver taels! Even if he were to sell himself off as a slave, he wouldn\u2019t be able to raise that much money!He still wanted to protest against the decision, but those around him had already smashed a fist right onto his chin, hitting his lower jaw out of place. As a result, he was unable to say anything anymore.Plum Blossom Seven\u2019s pitiful state immediately silenced the commotion in the casino. It was only then that everyone remembered that the Silverhook Casino was run by an underworld organization that had murdered many in cold blood.Zu An\u2019s eyes narrowed.It looks like this fellow is quite skilled in cleanups? But still, it\u2019s not that easy to make away with my money!\u201cSect Master Mei, aren\u2019t you thinking of everyone here as fools?\u201d Zu An said. \u201cPlum Blossom Seven is your godson as your aide, and this casino is a business of your Plum Blossom Sect too. Yet, you refused to acknowledge it when you lose money. If so, who would dare to visit your casino in the future?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right~\u201dThe surrounding crowd whispered in agreement amongst themselves. The most important thing to a casino was its credibility, and a casino that lacked credibility was bound to close down.If the Plum Blossom Sect wouldn\u2019t even honor its agreement to someone who had the backing of the Chu clan, it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what would happen to powerless individuals like them when they finally struck it rich.However, Mei Chaofeng sneered coldly, \u201cI can tell you outright that I\u2019ll be taking your money today! I\u2019ll be paying the other customers whatever they have earned, and of the entire Brightmoon City, you\u2019re the only one whom I won\u2019t even pay a single copper coin to. What can you do about it?\u201dHah, a wastrel like you wants to fight with me? No matter how hard a bird tries to fly to a higher branch, it\u2019ll never transform into a phoenix! I have been through all sorts of storms over the years, so what could a mere brat like you possibly do?Do you think that the world is all reasonable? Very well, I\u2019ll show you the treacherous side of the world then!\u201cSect Master Mei, you are being shameless over here!\u201d Chu Chuyan\u2019s face turned cold as she took a step forward, only to be suddenly held back by Zu An.Zu An looked at Mei Chaofeng with a smile and said, \u201cSect Master Mei, do you think that there\u2019s nothing I can do to you?\u201d\u201cWhat can you possibly do?\u201d Mei Chaofeng harrumphed coldly.A mere wastrel who had risen to his current position on a woman; what could he possibly be capable of?Zu An shrugged calmly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you aren\u2019t willing to pay me. From this day onward, I\u2019ll head to every single casino under your name and teach all of these people how to place their bets. I shall make sure that every single one of them wins every single round. What do you all think of that?\u201dThose words immediately riled up the gamblers and even the spectators outside too.\u201cSounds good!\u201d\u201cLove live young master Zu!\u201d\u201cYoung master Zu, you\u2019re handsome!\u201d\u201cYoung master Zu, you\u2019re like our new parents!\u201d\u201cYoung master Zu, has anyone told you that you\u2019re a fitting pair with Miss Chu?\u201d\u201cHoly shit, how could you spout such blatant lies?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you doing the same too?\u201d\u2026As the old sages had once said, for 50% of the profits, humans would choose to take risks; for 100% of the profits, humans would be willing to trample all over laws; for 300% of the profits, humans would be willing to commit any crime, including even murder.The profits that could be earned on the gambling table was massive\u2014Zu An had just exemplified it himself. That was an instantaneous profit of 15,000%!Who could possibly remain calm before this? A lot of these gamblers were people who were willing to die for money, so no matter how powerful the Plum Blossom Sect was, if it dared to shirk on all of their payment, they would unhesitatingly band together to overthrow the entire Plum Blossom Sect.Mei Chaofeng understood the threat lying in here, such that his face turned incredibly awful. \u201cYou\u2019re really able to win every round?\u201dZu An shrugged calmly. \u201cI\u2019ve already won 7,500,000 silver taels from you today. What do you think? Please call me the God of Gambling from this day onward!\u201dThe surrounding crowd began to shamelessly fawn on him upon hearing that he would lead them to great riches.\u201cGod of Gambling~\u201d\u201cGod of Gambling~\u201d\u201cGod of Gambling~\u201d\u2026Zu An closed his eyes as he enjoyed the crowd\u2019s cheerings. All that he lacked right now was a fitting BGM to further accentuate his disposition.On the other hand, Mei Chaofeng\u2019s cheeks began twitching uncontrollably. He had no idea how Zu An managed to do it, but based on the other party\u2019s tone, it would appear that he hadn\u2019t been winning by coincidence thus far.And in truth, it couldn\u2019t possibly have been a coincidence either. Or else, how could he possibly be so lucky?If this fellow were to lead the gamblers to wreak havoc in his other casinos, his business would be completely overthrown. However, paying up here wasn\u2019t an option either. One must know that this was 7,500,000 silver taels, not 75,000!All of a sudden, he found himself being placed in a quandary.It was then that a commotion broke out by the doorway.\u201cStand aside, stand aside!\u201dAn army of soldiers barged in, and the one leading them was a young man wearing golden armor. This young man had a slender frame and a decent face, and the shining armor he donned made him even more so eye-catching.\u201cWaaaa, how handsome!\u201d The girls in the vicinity whispered to themselves.Zu An harrumphed indignantly to those responses. Isn\u2019t it just the seduction of uniforms here? These women really haven\u2019t seen much of the world before.He secretly shot a glance at Chu Chuyan, and upon seeing that the latter was completely unfazed, he heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cWho are the ones causing trouble here?\u201d The young commander scanned the surroundings before finally laying his eyes upon Zu An.\u201cWhat are you looking at me for? Are you envious that I\u2019m better looking than you?\u201d Zu An responded impatiently. The fact that this man turned his gaze toward him from the moment he entered showed that he carried ill intention in mind. Since that was the case, there was no need to hold back against him at all.You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for +100 Rage!A Sang surname? What a rare surname, Zu An thought to himself.The young commander was just about to interrogate Zu An when the abrupt jab threw his plans completely off course, leaving him not knowing how to handle this.Fortunately for him, Mei Chaofeng quickly rushed over to rely on his new backing. \u201cCommander Sang, you came just on time. This fellow has conducted fraud in our casino. When I confronted him about it, he even threatened me that he would lead the other gamblers to mess around in my casino so as to spoil my business.\u201dThe crowd was completely dumbstruck. We know that you are from the underworld, but surely you don\u2019t need to be so blatantly corrupt, right? Do you take all of us to be dead?That being said, not a single person stood forward to speak up on Zu An. They knew just how unreasonable the world could be, so until it was made clear in whose favor the odds were leaning toward, it was best for them not to get involved.Zu An\u2019s promised money was enticing, but it would be all for naught if they were killed before he could even earn or spend it.The young commander named Sang Qian immediately stepped forward and bellowed, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s the crime of committing fraud? Ah right, how much did he scam you?\u201d\u201c7,500,000 silver taels,\u201d Mei Chaofeng replied with a bitter smile.\u201c7,500,000 silver taels?\u201d Sang Qian jolted in shock upon hearing that sum.Do you all play with such high stakes here? My father was once the Minister of Finance, but that\u2019s still an astronomical sum of money to the royal treasury!With such thoughts in mind, his face lit up in excitement. \u201cThe crime of committing fraud involving a huge sum of money warrants a sentence of at least 3 to 10 years in prison. In the case where the incident is particularly severe, it\u2019s possible to sentence to over 10 years as well. For daring to scam the Silverhook Casino for over 7,500,000 silver taels, you should resolve yourself to spending your entire life in prison!Zu An rolled his eyes, not bothering to respond to Sang Qian at all. Instead, he turned to Chu Chuyan and asked, \u201cHoney, who is this fellow? Why is he deciding on my crime right after hearing that Mei fellow\u2019s words? It looks like he has been accepting quite a bit of money form the Plum Blossom Sect, huh?\u201dThose words sparked a commotion in the crowd.Chu Chuyan\u2019s lips crept up a little as she explained, \u201cCommander Sang is the son of the ex-Minister of Finance. Lord Sang has become the new governor of our Linchuan Commandery, so you shouldn\u2019t take him lightly.\u201dSang Qian quickly bowed a little as he said, \u201cMiss Chu, you\u2019re too polite. I\u2019ll be needing the Chu clan\u2019s help for our work here in the future.\u201dThere was no man who could resist a beauty on the level of Chu Chuyan. Even though this father-son pair was obviously sent here to deal with the Chu clan, he still couldn\u2019t help but want to show his best side to her.But just as Sang Qiang was feeling good about his impeccable etiquette, a disharmonious voice sounded in the air, \u201cTsk~ I was still wondering how capable of a person you are, but it turns out that you\u2019re someone relying on connections just like me.\u201dAnd there stood Zu An, casually picking his ears.Sang Qian nearly choked on his own breath. He might have never met Zu An before, but there was no way he wouldn\u2019t have heard of the renowned drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan. This wastrel was a laughingstock in their circle, and yet, he was actually being associated with the other party now?He felt that this was an utter humiliation!You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for +300 Rage!Mei Chaofeng also widened his eyes in astonishment. One must know that Sang Qian had a very prestigious background. His father was an illustrious official from the royal court, holding power over huge swathes of land.On the other hand, Zu An was nothing more than a hoodlum who was just lucky to have gotten involved with the Chu clan.Is that even considered your backing at all? How shameless must you be to say such words? How shameless!You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +300 Rage!Zu An was a little confused. He was insulting Sang Qian here, yet the one who got angry turned out to be Mei Chaofeng instead. It looked like the two of them had some kind of illicit, underground relationship with one another.Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan looked at Sang Qian\u2019s raging eyes and chuckled quietly to herself. The world finally gets to see Zu An\u2019s shamelessness too. She cleared her throat and said, \u201cYoung master Sang, if I\u2019m not mistaken, you\u2019re just the commander of the River Patrol Team. You don\u2019t have any rights to interfere in such civil cases. It doesn\u2019t seem appropriate for you to pass a judgment on this matter here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaytBrightmoon City was well-developed commercially, especially when it came to the salt and metal industry, so it would often export and import goods. Most of the exportations and importations occurred through the river, so the River Patrol Team was formed. The goal of the River Patrol Team was to deal with the issue of smuggling, as well as to protect the shipping of strategic resources, such as necessities, especially since ferocious beasts would appear along the shoes of the river at some parts.Sang Qian calmly answered, \u201cWhile I\u2019m responsible for the River Patrol Team, it\u2019s also my job to ensure the security of the people. With so many people gathered here today, a small mistake can easily lead to a stampede. It\u2019s reasonable for me to drop by and enquire about it, right?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to trouble Commander Sang on this matter,\u201d a gentle voice sounded all of a sudden.From the doorway, escort by a group of guards, came a young man holding onto a paper fan. He had a face that was fair like white jade, and he emanated a scholarly vibe.\u201cIs this person a guy or a girl?\u201d\u201cShhh, are you tired of living? He\u2019s the young master of the City Lord Estate!\u201d\u2026Zu An was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect to see Xie Xiu here. Previously, he was still having difficulties trying to understand why the royal families and nobles liked to rear male concubines, but if they were as beautiful as Xie Xiu, it would still be understandable\u2026Pui, what the hell am I thinking about?Sang Qian\u2019s eyes turned grim as soon as he caught sight of Xie Xiu. \u201cSo it\u2019s young master Xie! If I recall correctly, young master Xie should be studying in Brightmoon Academy at the moment and has no official position yet. Isn\u2019t it inappropriate for you to issue an order to the guards despite the lack of authority?\u201dXie Xiu snapped his paper fan shut before smiling calmly at Sang Qian. \u201cIt goes without saying that I\u2019m not the one who brought these guards here. I was still drinking at the Heavenly Immortal Tavern a moment ago when I saw Uncle Pang leading a group of men over. It\u2019s out of a moment of curiosity that I tagged along as well. Isn\u2019t that so, Uncle Pang?\u201dA pot bellied man rushed into the casino while trying to steady his official hat from falling. It could be seen just how much of a hurry he was rushing here.\u201cThis man is the vice magistrate of the city, Pang Chun. He\u2019s a fifth rank cultivator, as well as the third-in-charge in Brightmoon City. He\u2019s on good terms with our Chu clan, so you better not run your mouth and insult him by accident. \u201cFearing that Zu An would talk nonsense, Chu Chuyan hurriedly warned him beforehand.Zu An quickly nodded his head, though there was a bizarre look on his face. A man named Pang Chun? Just what in the world is his parents thinking?However, Chu Chuyan\u2019s words had also revealed some important news to Zu An too. It would appear that the Chu clan was on close terms with the city lord, but just a few days ago, Chu Zhongtian mentioned that the governor Sang Hong was coming to the Linchuan Commandery to deal with them. It should be safe to assume that Sang Hong\u2019s movements represented the will of the royal court.My gosh, it can\u2019t be that the Chu clan is harboring rebellious thoughts? Are they colluding with local officials to undermine the royal court?Zu An thought that he had managed to cling onto a thick thigh, but it turned out to be a boat that was already on the verge of capsizing. It was no wonder why they couldn\u2019t even deal with a mere underworld organization!Should I find an opportunity to leap off this boat?If Chu Chuyan were to know of the thoughts running through his mind, she would surely push him down to the ground and pummel him up good.Pang Chun clasped his fist and greeted Sang Qian with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Commander Sang.\u201dSang Qian also didn\u2019t dare to act disrespectfully against the vice magistrate, the third-in-charge of Brightmoon City. So, he quickly answered, \u201cYes, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you too, Lord Vice Magistrate.\u201dThe two of them quickly traded pleasantries before turning to look at Xie Xiu. Their actions seemed to amuse Xie Xiu as he said, \u201cWhat are the two of you looking at me for? I\u2019ve no official position on me, so you should deal with the situation here according to the rules!\u201dSang Qian was full of retorts against that. Like we don\u2019t know that you were the one who called Pang Chun here! He\u2019s deeply loyal to your father, so who else would he listen to other than you?Pang Chun, on the other hand, looked at Sang Qian with a smile and said, \u201cCommander Sang, would you mind if I take over this case?\u201dSang Qian forced on a smile and replied, \u201cThis is the jurisdiction of the Lord Vice Magistrate. I dare not to overstep my boundaries.\u201dThe vice magistrate was responsible for maintaining security within the city, which made him similar to the sheriff or police chief. Needless to say, the authority he wielded was great.Pang Chun finally reined in his smile to look at the other parties gathered here. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201dChu Chuyan stepped forward and explained the chain of events to Pang Chun.When Pang Chun heard the words \u20187,500,000 silver taels\u2019, he almost leaped in shock, just like many others before him did. However, he quickly recovered and followed the flow of where Chu Chuyan was heading to. \u201cSect Master Mei, it looks like you\u2019re in the wrong here. Since you opened a casino, it\u2019s only right for you to accept a loss. Otherwise, if all casinos were to operate in the same way as you, it would be utter chaos in the world!\u201dMei Chaofeng was infuriated to see that Pang Chun was siding with Chu Chuyan, but he still answered with composure, \u201cLord Vice Magistrate, you are unaware of the full story. This man took only two rounds to win 7,500,000 silver taels. That\u2019s utterly unfathomable. There\u2019s no doubt that he must have employed some sort of trickery here, so how can we simply accept it like this?\u201dZu An was amused by the accusation. \u201cSay, don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s embarrassing that a casino owner like you is worried about his customers cheating? Does this show that your skills are lacking, or that you\u2019re just downright shameless?\u201d\u201cYou!!!\u201d Mei Chaofeng pointed his finger at Zu An furiously. If the two of us were alone here, I would have smashed that lowly bug with a single finger of mine!Shit!You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +499 Rage!Pang Chun also agreed with Zu An as well, \u201cSect Master Mei, since you claim that Zu An has cheated, do you have any evidence to back up your statement?\u201dThis was the first time that Zu An was enjoying the privileges of having a superior backing him up. Every single word uttered was sided with him\u2014though he was indeed on the side of reason this time around.Mei Chaofeng hesitated a little before answering, \u201cI don\u2019t have any evidence. I was not present earlier. Furthermore, Zu An came here together with Miss Chu. Miss Chu is a fifth rank cultivator, so I reckon that our men in the casino wouldn\u2019t be able to tell even if she tried to pull anything.\u201dChu Chuyan\u2019s face immediately turned chilly at that slander. \u201cAre you insinuating that I am cheating here?\u201dSince both sides had already fallen out with one another, Mei Chaofeng had no qualms offending the Chu clan anymore. \u201cWell, that\u2019s hard to say. He\u2019s your husband after all. Who knows whether the two of you are working with one another to scam me?\u201d\u201cOur Chu clan will not accept such slander. I shall challenge you to a duel!\u201d Chu Chuyan uttered with a wintry tone.Mei Chaofeng was not backing down either. \u201cI have only addressed you respectfully thus far out of consideration of the Chu clan. Don\u2019t take my consideration as a weakness!\u201dZu An watched the escalation in conflict excitedly, anticipating to watch an incredible duel. He was curious to see how rank five cultivators clashed with one another so that he would know how to better protect himself when dealing with one in the future.As for whether Chu Chuyan would be hurt in the duel\u2026 to be honest, he wasn\u2019t worried about that at all. For one, Xie Xiu and the vice magistrate were here. Furthermore, Brightmoon City was still the fief of the Chu clan, so how could Chu Zhongtian allow his own daughter to get bullied here?On top of that, she was also backed by Brightmoon Academy too.No matter how one looked at it, Mei Chaofeng was definitely disadvantaged here.However, Xie Xiu stepped forward at this moment to defuse the situation, \u201cPlease calm down and allow me to speak a word of justice. As everyone in Brightmoon City knows, the Chu clan has always strictly forbidden its own people from gambling\u2026\u201dThose words sent eyes gathering upon Zu An, which left Xie Xiu at a loss for words at a moment. However, he quickly found an excuse and continued on, \u201cWell, Zu An has only just married into the Chu clan not too long ago, so he might be unfamiliar with their rules. However, I trust that everyone in Brightmoon City knows what kind of person Chu First Miss is like.\u201d\u201cIndeed, how could Chu First Miss possibly cheat here?\u201d\u201cSect Master Mei, it\u2019s one thing for you to refuse to pay up, but how can you slander Miss Chu too?\u201d\u201cIndeed! Miss Chu would never resort to such despicable tricks!\u201d\u2026The surrounding crowd spoke up in agreement with Xie Xiu.Zu An was surprised by the resounding popularity of his wife. I didn\u2019t think that there would be so many people who like her. It almost feels like I\u2019m in a dangerous position here.Xie Xiu raised his hand to calm the crowd down before continuing on, \u201cAlso, as everyone knows, I\u2019m someone with hardly any strengths, spending my days idly\u2026 I dare not say for other matters, but I\u2019m at least rather proficient when it comes to matters concerning gambling. Based on what I know, all of the tools used in casinos are specially inscribed by runemasters in order to prevent cultivators from tampering with the results through their ki. It\u2019s an empty claim to say that Miss Chu is cheating just because her cultivation is higher than the others.\u201dAt the same time, Sang Qian was also a little annoyed at how Mei Chaofeng chose to drag Chu Chuyan into this matter of all other things he could have said. Seeing that the situation was against them right now, he had no choice but to speak up, \u201cIndeed. I can vouch with my life that Chu First Miss wouldn\u2019t cheat either. She\u2026\u201dBut before Sang Qian could finish his words, Zu An suddenly interjected with a contemplative mutter, \u201cHoney, if you admit that you were cheating right now, will we be able to get that guy over there to commit suicide?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Sang Qian.\u201c\u2026\u201d Xie Xiu.\u201c\u2026\u201d Pang Chun.\u201c\u2026\u201d Mei Chaofeng.It is just a figure of speech, are you really taking it for real?!?! What the hell? Just what kind of son-in-law did the Chu clan draft into their household?You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for +213 Rage!Chu Chuyan\u2019s face had also darkened upon hearing those words. \u201cBe quiet. Don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dSang Qian feigned as if he hadn\u2019t heard those words and tried to continue on. Wait, where was I at earlier? Damn it, that fellow!\u201cMiss Chu would never cheat, but as for young master Zu, I trust that there are plenty of people in the city who know about his personality, as well as his\u2026 capability. It\u2019s impossible for him to win 7,500,000 silver taels here within two rounds. If so, that only leaves a single possibility\u2014he has bribed Plum Blossom Seven ahead of time to scam the casino of its money!\u201dSang Qian was merely short of openly claiming that Zu An was a trash.On the other hand, Mei Chaofeng\u2019s eyes lit up in excitement. His earlier accusation was filled with many loopholes, but Sang Qian\u2019s argument had utterly denied the legitimacy of the means Zu An used to obtain the 7,500,000 silver taels. Not only so, they would also be able to turn the tables around and pursue Zu An for this matter.As expected of someone who had come from the capital! What ingenious means!\u201cWuuuuu~\u201d Plum Blossom Seven, on the other hand, was scared out of his wits. He hadn\u2019t expected to get implicated in this shitshow too. Unfortunately, his lower jaw had already been snapped out of place, so he couldn\u2019t say anything despite feeling utterly anxious.Pah~ Pah~ Pah~Applause sounded in the casino. The surrounding crowd turned their eyes over, only to see that it was Zu An. \u201cCommander Sang, could you possibly be one of the bosses behind this Silverhook Casino?\u201dSang Qian\u2019s face immediately darkened. \u201cWhat rubbish are you talking about? Slandering an official of the royal court is a heavy crime!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Sang Qian for +200 Rage!\u201cSince you aren\u2019t one of the bosses of the Silverhook Casino, why do you keep speaking up for them ever since you stepped in here?\u201d Zu An asked.Sang Qian harrumphed coldly. \u201cI\u2019m just making a logical deduction based on the facts here.\u201d\u201cLike you said, it\u2019s only a deduction. Then, on the basis that you kept speaking up for Mei Chaofeng, I\u2019m also just making a logical deduction that you are in collusion with the Plum Blossom Sect. May I know if my deductions can be used as evidence?\u201d\u201cYou!!\u201d Sang Qian turned his face away. \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered to argue with someone like you.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Sang Qian for +100 Rage!Sang Qian was slowly calming down. Given the disparity in their standings, it would be beneath him to argue with Zu An in public.Zu An, on the other hand, turned to the plump Pang Chun and said, \u201cLord Vice Magistrate, in your many years of experience dealing with such cases, I trust that you should have a clear idea as to what\u2019s going on here, right?\u201dSang Qian also spoke up as well, \u201cLord Pang, please don\u2019t allow the threats of another man to affect your judgment.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Pang Chun was put in a spot. Sweat droplets were falling from his forehead.Of course, he was very clear what was going on here, but the Plum Blossom Sect had been \u2018offering tributes\u2019 to the various administrative departments in the city over the last few years, and it had an elusive background too. Since Sang Qian was already openly backing the Plum Blossom Sect, could it mean that its backing was no other than Sang Hong?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, with the son of the city lord and First Miss Chu eyeing him here, no matter what he chose, he would surely offend one side. This was truly a headache to deal with.It was then that the sound of galloping horses sounded outside. A glint immediately flashed across Sang Qian and Mei Chaofeng\u2019s eyes.Of the entire Brightmoon City, there was no one else who had an army of cavalry other than the Chu clan.Soon, a tall silhouette that looked almost like a metal tower marched into the casino with a group of soldiers. All of these soldiers were donned in golden armor and red cloaks. There was a sharpness in their eyes that kept others away. As soon as they entered the casino, they immediately stood in two rows, surrounding everyone.Their sharp and organized footsteps cast a grim and heavy atmosphere in the casino.\u201cThis is the Chu clan\u2019s Red Cloak Army. They do look much more formidable than those from the River Patrol Team.\u201d\u201cShhh, quiet down! You don\u2019t want your life anymore?\u201d\u2026The whisperings from the crowd made Sang Qian\u2019s cheeks twitch a little. He stepped forward and bellowed, \u201cYue Shan, what are you doing right now? How dare the Chu clan mobilize its private army without any legitimate justification? Are you planning a rebellion here?\u201dEven though it hadn\u2019t been long since Sang Qian was appointed, he was still able to recognize the leader of the Chu clan\u2019s Red Cloak Army.\u201cWe only heard that our First Miss has been bullied, so we came here to protect her. Surely our Chu clan is justified in ensuring the safety of its own clan members?\u201d Yue Shan replied coldly.After saying those words, he walked up to Chu Chuyan and bowed respectfully to her. \u201cPaying respects to the First Miss.\u201dThis turn of events had further hyped up Zu An. How cool would it be if he calls me young master under such a situation?So, he waited in anticipation for Yue Shan to greet him too, only to see the latter looking at him hesitantly before turning his head away without saying anything. Indeed, Yue Shan was disregarding his presence.Meanwhile, Chu Chuyue smiled in response as she reached out to help Yue Shan up.After the exchange of formalities, Yue Shan quickly got straight to the point. \u201cFirst Miss, the Master has said that no matter how weakened our Chu clan is, we won\u2019t allow a mere underworld organization to climb over our heads. As long as you give the word, we\u2019ll obliterate the Plum Blossom Sect today!\u201dThose words immediately provoked a huge reaction from the crowd.Even Mei Chaofeng shuddered in shock at those words. The Plum Blossom Sect had been able to fare well in recent years not because they were powerful, but that the powers in Brightmoon City had implicitly recognized their existence and turned a blind eye to their activities.However, if they were to fall out with one another, the head of an underworld organization like him, even if he had backing from some higher-ups, couldn\u2019t possibly be a match for a ducal clan!Putting aside the fact that the Brightmoon Duke was an eighth rank cultivator, just the Chu clan\u2019s Red Cloak Army was more than enough to obliterate the entire Plum Blossom Sect!He had no choice but to turn to Sang Qian for help.Sang Qian was also taken aback by how decisive the Chu clan was regarding this matter, such that he was unable to decide on a stance right away.Seeing how these two fellows were reacting, Zu An felt exhilarated inside. He had indeed made the right choice choosing to cling onto the thighs of the Chu clan. It sure felt good to oppress others with his connections!He even forgot about his earlier thoughts to leap out of this \u2018sinking ship\u2019.In the end, it was Pang Chun who coughed slightly and remarked probingly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem appropriate for the Chu clan to get involved with the administrative affairs here.\u201dThose words jolted Sang Qian out of his daze, and he hurriedly added, \u201cIndeed! Is the Chu clan intending on plotting a rebellion here?\u201dChu Chuyan stepped forward and sneered coldly, \u201cIs clearing off an underworld organization considered a rebellion? I must ask you to watch your words, or else I have no choice but to think that you\u2019re intentionally defaming the Chu clan.\u201dWith the First Miss of the Chu clan making her words known, the soldiers of the Chu clan placed their hands on the handles of their swords, ready to draw their blades and clear the field right away as soon as the command was issued.Sang Qian gulped fearfully. \u201cWhether the Plum Blossom Sect is an underworld organization or not, and how it should be punished should be a matter for the city lord to decide on. It\u2019s against the rules for the Chu clan to overstep its jurisdiction.\u201d\u201cVery well, let\u2019s follow the rules then.\u201d Chu Chuyan\u2019s eyes turned utterly cold. \u201cSomeone has plotted to electrocute my h\u2026 husband in the suburbs of the city, and there was an attempt to assassinate him outside the city right afterward. And not too long ago, someone tried to make use of his debt to sever his limbs\u2026 All of these matters are related to the Plum Blossom Sect. May I ask Lord Pang to arrest Mei Chaofeng and his 13 godsons, as well as all of the higher-ups of the Plum Blossom Sect. They must be thoroughly interrogated for their involvement in this matter.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d Pang Chun was put in a spot. He quickly turned his eyes toward Xie Xiu for assistance.Xie Xiu was also unsure of how he should maneuver the situation either. He had heard rumors that Zu An wasn\u2019t too welcomed in the Chu clan, but the current situation appeared to disprove the rumors. In fact, Chu Chuyan appeared to be ready to go all out for Zu An.This realization left him feeling deeply envious. While he was still somewhat on friendly terms with Zu An, he was still a man after all. There was no man who could remain unfazed upon seeing a woman as beautiful as Chu Chuyan standing up for another man.However, Xie Xiu quickly adjusted his state of mind. In the first place, his target wasn\u2019t a perfect woman like First Miss Chu. After all, no matter how perfect a woman was, the happiness she could bring to one could never be a match for a harem of women.At the very least, that was his life\u2019s philosophy. He would never get involved with those extraordinary women as they would only hinder him from philandering around. He liked how things currently were\u2014flirting around with those lesser-known beautiful women and doing as he liked without having to think too much into matters; this was what life should be like!Meanwhile, Pang Chun was still waiting for Xie Xiu to give a directive to him, only to see bizarre expressions appearing on the latter\u2019s face. This left him at a loss as to what to do.It was then that Chu Chuyan spoke up once more, \u201cIf Lord Pang is worried about offending others, why don\u2019t I have my men personally capture them and deliver them to the magistrate court?\u201d\u201cMiss Chu, please calm down.\u201d Pang Chun took out a handkerchief to wipe off his sweat. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for us to talk things over first.\u201dMeanwhile, Sang Hong\u2019s eyes also turned grim as well. The crime of attempted assassination on a member of a ducal clan was a huge matter. Seeing the killing intent emanated by First Miss Chu and the members of the Red Cloak Army surrounding them, he dared not to speak up for the Plum Blossom Sect recklessly anymore. He feared that it would bring his father trouble.Mei Chaofeng\u2019s heart was also pounding frenziedly. Am I going to meet my end here?With such thoughts in mind, a vicious glint flashed across his eyes as he made up his mind. At the very least, I\u2019ll bring some of them down with me!It was then that a voice sounded in his ears. \u201cWrite down a debt note of 7,500,000 silver taels and put an end to the matter here.\u201dMei Chaofeng could tell that it was Snow secretly transmitting her voice to him. It was then that he realized that the reason why the Chu clan was going hard on him was due to the debt of 7,500,000 silver taels. However, was it really safe for him to write such a debt note?Sensing Mei Chaofeng\u2019s hesitation, Snow hurriedly said once more, \u201cAre you a fool? Even if you write a debt note, you can still think of ways to delay the payment or even avert it all together later on! If the Chu clan were to really eradicate your Plum Blossom Sect today, the young master\u2019s years of effort would go down the drain!\u201dA tight frown formed on Mei Chaofeng\u2019s forehead as he replied, \u201cHowever, the Chu clan doesn\u2019t have the authority to pass judgment on us. If they dare to make a move here, the governor would surely clamp down hard on them afterward.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. The city lord of Brightmoon City is someone from King Qi\u2019s faction. Besides, once you're locked in prison by then, there would surely be plenty of people who will step forward to testify against you. You should know deep well how many evil deeds the Plum Blossom Sect has committed over the years. Once they really start looking into it, you\u2019ll be over!\u201d Seeing how Mei Chaofeng still didn\u2019t understand the gravity of the situation, Snow emphasized in a mixture of anxiety and fury.Mei Chaofeng was conflicted, but he had no choice but to make a decision here. So, he turned to Chu Chuyan and apologized. \u201cOur Plum Blossom Sect has acted inappropriately here today and offended Miss Chu. Allow me to apologize to you here. I hope that you\u2019ll be magnanimous as to forgive us for our mistakes today.\u201dHaving to say such subservient words before such a huge crowd left him with a burning heat on his cheeks. He could imagine how he would become the laughingstock of the crowd after tonight. The reputation that he had built up painstakingly over many years would be going to ruin just like that.However, he had no other choice here. He dared not to gamble on the Chu clan\u2019s determination to pull him down. If the Chu clan were to really order its army to apprehend everyone of the Plum Blossom Sect, it would indubitably be the end of the sect.If he was just an individual, he might have still considered screwing everything so as to uphold his dignity. However, the Plum Blossom Sect didn\u2019t just belong to him.There was someone behind him, and that someone had devoted great effort and resources into supporting him over the years. If the Plum Blossom Sect were to be destroyed within the span of a single night, even if he managed to get out of here with his life, there was no doubt that his backing would ensure that he was met with a cruel death.So, he could only put down his pride and apologize to the lady who was much younger than him. At this very moment, every single stare coming from the crowd felt like a huge shame to him.However, Mei Chaofeng apology didn\u2019t appear to have fazed Chu Chuyan at all. He knew very well that it was impossible to settle the matter here with just a couple of words, so he shouted, \u201cMen, bring me paper and brush!\u201dSoon, his subordinates brought paper and brush over. He quickly wrote out a debt note and handed it over to Chu Chuyan. \u201cMiss Chu, here is a debt note of 7,500,000 silver taels. We\u2019re willing to admit our loss and pay what is owed to you. However, we can\u2019t afford to fork out such a huge sum of money in a moment\u2019s time\u2014there\u2019s probably no power in the world who has the ability to pull that off. So, I need to ask Miss Chu to give us some leeway. We\u2019ll make sure to pay an interest every year. As for the main sum, we\u2019ll find a way to raise the money. May I know what\u2019s your thought about it?\u201dMei Chaofeng had played a little trick here. It was stated on the debt note that the money was owed to Zu An and not the Chu clan. He wouldn\u2019t be in a good position to shirk off a debt against the Chu clan, but if it was just Zu An, there was still space to maneuver around.Chu Chuyan noticed this detail too, but in consideration that the money was won by Zu An, she didn\u2019t think that it was appropriate for her to claim his earning as a property of the Chu clan. So, she turned to Zu An and asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dZu An was pleased to see that Chu Chuyan was seeking his opinion. He took a look at the note before remarking pretentiously, \u201cAiyo. If only Sect Master Mei did this earlier, this matter could be resolved easily. Yet, you just had to try your luck. Looks like you\u2019re the kind of person who needs a spanking before you\u2019ll learn!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +888 Rage!Mei Chaofeng nearly spurted blood on the spot. If not for the Chu clan, I would never allow a wastrel like you to talk shit to me!He nearly gave in to his rage to pummel Zu An into dust on the spot, but looking at Chu Chuyan and the Red Cloak Army that Yue Shan had brought here, he could only swallow his grievances down.Zu An took a look at the debt note and said, \u201cHm? You\u2019re only going to pay the interests? Well, I shall have magnanimity and go easy on you. I shall charge only 10% per annum. I trust that it\u2019s acceptable to you?\u201d\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Mei Chaofeng replied with gritted teeth.To be fair, a rate of 10% per annum was not expensive at all. Compared to the high-interest loan charged by the Plum Blossom Sect, an interest rate of 10% was almost like free money.Yet, why did it feel particularly jarring hearing these words coming out of Zu An\u2019s mouth? Not to mention, that merciful look he had on his face that made it seem as if he was showing pity to a beggar\u2026You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +345 Rage!Upon hearing those words, Zu An waved his hands and said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve agreed to it, let\u2019s tally the interests right, shall we? 10% of 7,500,000 silver taels is 750,000 silver taels. Are you going to pay with silver ingots or banknotes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Mei Chaofeng.\u201c\u2026\u201d Sang Qian.\u201c\u2026\u201d Xie Xiu.\u201c\u2026\u201d Pang Chun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Fianc\u00e9eEven the Chu clan\u2019s Red Cloak Army couldn\u2019t help but stare at one another. Their young master was indeed a little shameless.\u201cWhere in the world do you see anyone collecting interests right after making a loan? At the very least, you should wait till a year has passed!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +200 Rage!\u201cAh? There isn\u2019t such a practice?\u201d Zu An looked around in confusion, acting as if he had no idea what the rules regarding this were.Chu Chuyan had an urge to find a hole and hide. Why in the world did she choose such a shameless fellow as her husband?\u201cThe usual practice is indeed to collect interests in a year\u2019s time. However, based on what I know, Sect Master Mei does have the practice of \u201890% for 130%\u2019, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for us to collect 750,000 silver taels in advance.\u201dThe so-called \u201890% for 130%\u2019 referred to a common example of a loan shark lending an individual 10 silver taels at an interest rate of 10% per month, but, in fact, only effectively loaned out 9 silver taels but demanded 13 silver taels back by the end of three months. It was due to such shady practices that many people ended up going bankrupt by loan sharks.Compared to how the Plum Blossom Sect charged 10% interest rate every month, they were being merciful by only charging 10% per annum. If not for the fact that 7,500,000 silver taels was indeed a huge sum, she wouldn\u2019t have accepted such terms.Of course, she could tell that the Plum Blossom Sect had the intention to shirk payment too. After all, 7,500,000 silver taels was indeed a huge sum. Thus, it was best to collect as much as they could before they tried to pull anything.Mei Chaofeng gritted his teeth. He had already realized that he wouldn\u2019t be getting out of this without at least forking out a sum. Thus, he waved his hand and ordered, \u201cMen, bring 100,000 silver taels worth of banknotes here!\u201dAfter that, he turned to Chu Chuyan and said, \u201cMiss Chu, please pardon me. We don\u2019t have the ability to raise that much money in a moment\u2019s time, so we\u2019ll first pay you 100,000 silver taels as a show of sincerity. We\u2019ll repay the rest at the end of the year. What do you think of it?\u201dMei Chaofeng didn\u2019t even bother to consult Zu An on this matter because he was worried that the latter would go on spouting some bullshit once more. In any case, he could tell that the real decision-maker here was Chu Chuyan.Chu Chuyan hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement. Based on her estimations, 100,000 silver taels was likely to be the maximum sum that the Plum Blossom Sect could raise in a moment\u2019s time. It wouldn\u2019t be good if they force the Plum Blossom Sect too tightly.One of Mei Chaofeng\u2019s aides quickly brought the banknotes over. Mei Chaofeng's first intention was to hand it over to Chu Chuyan, but after some thought, he decided to pass it to Zu An instead. \u201cYoung master Zu, would you like to count it?\u201dIt would be hard for him to get those banknotes back if it were to land into Chu Chuyan\u2019s hands. However, if it was in Zu An\u2019s hand\u2026 Hehehe, I have my means to make him spit it out!\u201cYes, of course!\u201d Zu An took the banknotes and began counting them one by one. With each banknote worth 100 silver taels, a sum of 100,000 silver taels meant that there were 1000 banknotes in total.Mei Chaofeng nearly choked on his saliva. I was just saying it as a figure of speech! Who in the world counts the sum of money right before others?You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +111 Rage!Watching as Zu An counted the banknotes one by one like a scrooge, Sang Qian frowned in incomprehension as he wondered why a woman as beautiful as Chu Chuyan would end up marrying such an unseemly man. It was really like a fresh flower being stuck in a pile of cow dung. I would have been much better than him!There were many in the crowd who shared the same thoughts, and this included the soldiers of the Red Cloak Army too. All of them contributed a good sum of Rage points over to Zu An.\u201cHm? Why is there a banknote missing?\u201d It was then that Zu An suddenly exclaimed in astonishment, which drew everyone\u2019s attention over.\u201cHow is that possible? There are so many eyes looking here, so how could there be money missing?\u201d Mei Chaofeng exclaimed with a darkened face.Sensing the intent gaze of the crowd, Zu An shrugged casually and said, \u201cI\u2019m just saying it to check if you are lying to me or not.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Mei Chaofeng.So you\u2019re just making fun of me?You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +211 Rage!By the side, Sang Qian finally came to the limit of his patience. \u201cEnough! Since this matter has been resolved, all of you should disperse now!\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to stay here and watch a wastrel prance around as if he owned the world. What made him feel even more frustrated was that he couldn\u2019t do anything about that wastrel!Pang Chun also laughed heartily and said, \u201cIndeed. Since the matter has been resolved, you all should go back to do what you were doing. Let\u2019s leave, everyone.\u201dAll this while, he felt that his heart was pounding in his throat, ready to leap out of his mouth at any moment. If the Chu clan were to get into a conflict with the River Patrol Team here, or if the Plum Blossom Sect were to get desperate and attempt to break out of the casino, it could very well escalate into a major incident. In the end, he would be the one who had to take responsibility to the matter.With two of the highest-ranking individuals present ordering so, the gamblers and spectators quickly rushed out. They had no wish of lingering around and risk getting implicated in this matter.Xie Xiu waved his hand and Zu An, saying, \u201cBrother Zu, you have really refreshed my opinion of you today. I shall treat you to wine another day. I would honestly love to trade insights with you.\u201dZu An laughed in response to those words. \u201cThere are also many things that I would love to learn from Brother Xie too, such as your ability to tread freely amongst flowers without a single petal falling upon you.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it another day~\u201d Xie Xiu noticed the awful look on Chu Chuyan\u2019s face and smiled sheepishly. You sure are an incredible man. To think that you would dare to say such words before your own wife.Afraid of getting implicated in Chu Chuyan\u2019s wrath, he quickly bade farewell and escaped the area.Zu An still wasn\u2019t too satisfied with his loot this time around. He felt that the crowd was leaving before he could even earn his fill of Rage points, and that left him feeling like something was missing. So, he turned to Mei Chaofeng and asked, \u201cSect Master Mei, are you still going to keep your casino open? Can I come here to gamble once more?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Mei Chaofeng.If you dare come here once more, I shall rip off your skin!You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +267 Rage!Chu Chuyan couldn\u2019t stand to watch this anymore. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNo matter how nonchalant she was, she couldn\u2019t stand all of the shocking words that Zu An was constantly spouting out of his mouth.Meanwhile, Yue Shan walked straight toward Zu An and personally escorted him out of the casino. As someone who had served the Chu clan for many years, he was used to the nobles\u2019 etiquette, so Zu An\u2019s shameless actions were hard for him to endure.Mei Chaofeng watched coldly as Zu An and the others left, and he clenched his fists tightly in anger.\u201cSect master, are we really going to pay that fellow 7,500,000 silver taels?\u201d One of the dumber subordinates approached Mei Chaofeng and asked worriedly.\u201cPay your head!\u201d Mei Chaofeng unhesitatingly slapped that subordinate to the ground.With an awful look on his face, he headed into a room specially prepared for him in the casino to rest when he found that someone was already waiting for him inside.\u201cMiss Qiao, you got to write down the debt note. How do you intend to resolve this matter?\u201d Mei Chaofeng closed the room as he asked. His tone was no longer as amiable as before anymore.\u201cYou should have a good idea just what kind of situation you were in earlier. Would you have gotten out of the situation if you didn\u2019t write a debt note?\u201d Needless to say, the person waiting in the room was no other than Snow. Looking at Mei Chaofeng\u2019s twitching cheeks, she consoled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the debt note is in the hands of the wastrel Zu An. You should be able to get it back with ease.\u201dMei Chaofeng frowned. \u201cI\u2019m just worried that he would hand the debt note over to the Chu clan.\u201dSnow shook her head and replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about that. Chu Chuyan is a proud person, so she wouldn\u2019t take Zu An\u2019s money. As for Chu Zhongtian, he\u2019s an upright person, and the Chu clan strictly forbids gambling. He wouldn\u2019t forsake his principles to take money earned through gambling. In fact, the Chu clan will not approve of Zu An\u2019s actions here; on the contrary, it\u2019s likely that he would be severely punished. After all, his actions have flouted what the Chu clan stands for.\u201d\u201cWill they chase Zu An out of the Chu clan over this?\u201d Mei Chaofeng asked.Snow sighed deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t know. 7,500,000 silver taels is a huge sum of money, but if we could get Zu An chased out of the Chu clan over it, it\u2019s still not too bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Mei Chaofeng.It\u2019s not your money, so of course you don\u2019t feel anything about it! Do you even understand what 7,500,000 silver taels mean? With this much money, I would be able to hire assassins to get rid of the patriarch of the Chu clan! Yet, I actually spent this much money just to deal with a wastrel?Fortunately, what Snow said right after placated him a little. \u201cRest assured, I\u2019ll make a move personally tonight. Not only will I steal the debt note, but I\u2019ll also get rid of that brat too so as to resolve any future problems.\u201dMei Chaofeng was overjoyed. \u201cThank you, Miss Qiao.\u201dTo be frank, with his strength, he could kill Zu An as easily as killing an ant. However, Zu An was usually either in the Chu Estate or Brightmoon Academy, leaving him with no chance to make a move. However, if an insider like Snow were to do the job instead, the chances of success were much higher.Meanwhile, in the Zheng Estate located not too far away from the Silverhook Casino, a woman was staring at a man seated before her attentively. Her eyes were clear like refreshing spring water, and her skin was fair like snow. Gorgeous would be an apt word to describe her.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, young master Zu? You look rather discomposed today.\u201d The woman poured a cup of tea for the man before her. Her movements were incredibly graceful, such that it was easy to mistake it for a dance.The man seated before her was no other than Sang Qian, who had just left the Silverhook Casino.\u201cMiss Zheng\u2019s tea brewing skill is indeed a feast for the eyes.\u201d The elegant and tender disposition coming from the woman before him calmed Sang Qian\u2019s heart.The woman smiled gently and said, \u201cOnce our engagement is fulfilled, I\u2019d be more than happy to brew tea for you every day.\u201dThis woman was no other than the young miss of the Zheng Clan, Zheng Dan. The Zheng clan had an engagement with the Sang clan, making her Sang Qian\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.Even though this was not the first time they were meeting, a hint of wonderment still flashed across the depths of Sang Qian\u2019s eyes. When Sang Qian first heard that his father had engaged her to the daughter of a businessman in Brightmoon City, he was still rather unsatisfied. He even fought with his father on several occasions over the matter.However, as soon as he met Zheng Dan, all of his opposition vanished into thin air. The reason for that? The daughter of that businessman was simply too beautiful. He felt that it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing to marry such a woman.\u201cThank you, Miss Zheng.\u201d Sang Qian reached out to grab the teacup, secretly making use of this opportunity to touch Zheng Dan\u2019s hand too. However, the latter naturally averted her hands.\u201cYoung master Zheng, I\u2019d be yours once we marry one another. By then, I\u2019ll go along with whatever you wish to do with me. But now\u2026\u201d The meaning behind Zheng Dan\u2019s words was very clear. She didn\u2019t want to get intimate with him prior to their marriage.A hint of rage flickered across Sang Qian\u2019s eyes, but he swiftly concealed it. The more Zheng Dan acted in such a manner, the more enticed he was. It felt almost like someone was tickling his heart, stoking his desire for her. He even wondered that men were born as despicable creatures, desiring things that were only out of their reach.\u201cSomething happened earlier at the Silverhook Casino\u2026\u201d In order to conceal his awkwardness, Sang Qian quickly went through what happened earlier.A tinge of astonishment colored Zheng Dan\u2019s face as she remarked, \u201cHm? The Silverhook Casino actually allowed Zu An to walk away with an earning of 7,500,000 silver taels? I\u2019ve long heard that the young master of the Chu clan is a wastrel, but it looks like the rumors can\u2019t be trusted.\u201dHer tone, which seemed to be complimenting another man, left Sang Qian feeling a little uncomfortable on the inside. \u201cHmph, he was just lucky. He just managed to get two bets right blindly.\u201dZheng Dan chuckled softly as her crimson lips curled up into a beautiful smile. She could see through Sang Qian\u2019s thoughts, so she intentionally avoided saying anything to trigger him.Sang Qian continued speaking, \u201cSpeaking of which, I do have something I need your help on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Any problem you\u2019re facing is naturally my problem too. Feel free to speak.\u201dSang Qian quietly clicked his tongue. You speak such beautiful words, but you wouldn\u2019t even allow me to hold your hands.\u201cDoesn\u2019t Zu An have a debt note of seven and a half million silver taels at the Silverhook Casino at the moment? He\u2019s under the protection of the Chu clan, and he spends the rest of his time at Brightmoon Academy. As you know, I\u2019m not in a good position to interfere in the affairs at the academy, so may I ask you to get close to him and \u2018borrow\u2019 the debt note from him?\u201d\u201cHow should I get close to him?\u201d Zheng Dan frowned as an ominous premonition pounded in her heart.\u201cAll men in the world are vulnerable to the ensnarement of a beauty, let alone trash like him. With your looks, you\u2019ll surely be able to easily enchant him and make him do your bidding.\u201d Sang Qian made a confident gesture as a cold sneer sat on the corner of his lips.Zheng Dan\u2019s face immediately chilled. She stood up and coldly uttered, \u201cJust what kind of person do you take me for?\u201d\u201cI know that I\u2019m putting you in a spot here, but you\u2019re the only one I can trust here. That\u2019s why I came to seek your help,\u201d Sang Qian quickly clarified.However, that did little to placate Zheng Dan\u2019s rage. She scoffed in a fit of anger, \u201cSo, the idea you came up with is to have your fianc\u00e9e seduce another man?\u201dSang Qian frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t phrase it so awfully. I just want you to find an opportunity to get close to him. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking you to get in bed with him. I reckon a lowlife like him barely has any experience with women. With your looks, all you have to do is whisper some sweet nothings to make him do your bidding.\u201d\u201cHis wife is the number one beauty of Brightmoon City, Chu Chuyan! With someone like that by his side, can he really be considered as someone who has no experience with women?\u201d replied Zheng Dan.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of you as inferior to Chu Chuyan in any way. In terms of appearance, each of you have your own charms. The only reason people see her as the number one beauty is out of deference to her position as the daughter of the Brightmoon Duke. Haven\u2019t you thought of stealing her man so as to vent the frustrations you\u2019ve pent up all these years?\u201d Sang Qian sharply noticed the slight fluctuation in Zheng Dan\u2019s tone, so he decided to push a little harder.He was aware that, despite his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s gentle exterior, she had always viewed Chu Chuyan as her rival. She would easily lose her composure whenever it came to affairs involving Chu Chuyan.As expected, Zheng Dan\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. She was moved by Sang Qian\u2019s proposal. \u201cSince you don\u2019t mind, I can give approaching Zu An a try. However, if he manages to take advantage of me, the one that\u2019ll lose out is you.\u201dSang Qian burst out laughing. \u201cOthers might not know better, but I know that beneath your gentle exterior is a proud soul. Trash of Zu An\u2019s caliber can never catch your eye, so how could you possibly allow him to take advantage of you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that. Since you want me to lay a honey trap for him, it\u2019s likely that I\u2019ll have to offer him some benefits in order to hook him on. We should prepare for the worst. What\u2019s the limit of your tolerance regarding that?\u201d\u201cThe limit of my tolerance\u2026 at most, a hug. No, that won\u2019t do as well. Just holding hands, that's the most I can accept!\u201d Just the thought of Zu An taking advantage of his fianc\u00e9e made Sang Qian feel deeply uncomfortable all over. \u201cOnce the matter is done, I\u2019ll make sure to cut off his hands.\u201dZheng Dan chuckled softly at Sang Qian\u2019s display of jealousy. What\u2019s the big deal about holding hands? I just have to wash them afterward. It\u2019s his mere ego that makes him overly obsessed with such trivialities.\u201cSpeaking of which, why did you all settle for the debt note? You can\u2019t possibly be thinking that the Plum Blossom Sect has the resources to pay all those silver taels, right?\u201d asked Zheng Dan.\u201cThe Plum Blossom Sect doesn\u2019t have the ability to raise that much money, but it\u2019s a different story if we consider the master they\u2019re serving,\u201d Sang Qian said with a scheming laugh.While they were in a partnership at the moment, ultimately, their goals still differed from one another. If they ever fell out with one another in the future, this debt note would prove an invaluable weapon.Zheng Dan nodded in response. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to ask about the details of such lowly schemes. The higher a person\u2019s standing was, the more they scorned such despicable and dirty tricks. \u201cTell me more about this Zu An. I\u2019ve only heard some rumors about him thus far. Since you met him today, the information you have should be more accurate.\u201dThinking about what he had encountered in the casino, Sang Qian began speaking hatefully, \u201cHe\u2019s a minor character whose arrogance got ahead of his ability just because he managed to climb onto the high branches of the Chu clan. He\u2019s an incredibly shameless and despicable person\u2026.\u201d\u2026Achoo!Zu An rubbed his nose and wondered who was talking behind his back.Beside him, Chu Chuyan shot him a glance and asked, \u201cYou must be very happy right now.\u201dZu An replied with a chuckle, \u201cThere\u2019s no one who wouldn\u2019t feel happy after winning seven and a half million silver taels.\u201d\u201cWith how the incident has blown up, I reckon that my parents are already aware of it by now. Let\u2019s see how you deal with it then,\u201d Chu Chuyan harrumphed in response.Zu An was taken aback. \u201cIt\u2019s still an issue even if I won?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue about money here. My parents care a lot about the reputation of the Chu clan, and it\u2019s a known fact that our Chu clan strictly forbids its clan members from gambling. You went a bit too far this time around, nearly stirring up a conflict between our private army and the local guards. There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll turn a blind eye to that,\u201d replied Chu Chuyan.Zu An was displeased. \u201cBut that\u2019s seven and a half million silver taels we\u2019re talking about here! Does the annual profit of the Chu clan even come close to that number? Why am I going to get punished after earning so much money?\u201d\u201cIs the seven and a half million silver taels in your hands right now?\u201d Chu Chuyan silenced him with a sharp jab. \u201cWe all know there\u2019s no way the Plum Blossom Sect will repay its debt. We\u2019re putting ourselves at risk for a blank promise for repayment over here. It\u2019s only natural that my parents would get angry.\u201d\u201cBut can\u2019t we still collect interest from them every year?\u201d asked Zu An weakly.\u201cThat\u2019s just mere words. There\u2019s bound to be complications later on,\u201d Chu Chuyan sighed.She knew the Plum Blossom Sect would renege on its promise, but there was nothing she could do. She couldn\u2019t possibly really order the Red Cloak Army to massacre the Plum Blossom Sect, after all\u2014that would be falling right into the enemy\u2019s trap. If that happened, the royal court would have the legitimacy to deal with the Chu clan.\u201cYoung miss, young miss~\u201dSnow suddenly ran over, gasping for breath.\u201cWhere did you go? What took you so long?\u201d asked Chu Chuyan with a frown.Snow quickly explained, \u201cI also don\u2019t know what\u2019s up today, but my stomach feels unwell.\u2026\u201dZu An waved his hand before his nose in disdain. \u201cIn other words, you went to take a shit, right? You must\u2019ve filled up the entire lavatory if you shitted for so long.\u201dSnow was struck dumb.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +444 Rage!She had just rushed over after meeting Mei Chaofeng, and she was just making an excuse for Chu Chuyan to drop the matter. Normal people would just turn a blind eye to it, not bothering to ask any further. Yet, who could have thought that Zu An would actually dig deeper into it, and even scorn her? It was almost as if there was a stench coming from her!\u201cYoung miss, look at him!\u201d Snow stomped her feet angrily as she tugged Chu Chuyan\u2019s sleeves in protest.I\u2019m going to kill this vile fellow later tonight, so we can\u2019t get into a conflict right now. Otherwise, people will surely suspect me.Chu Chuyan glared at Zu An. \u201cCan you not be so disgusting?\u201dIt was worthy of note that even though she had berated Zu An, she still subconsciously shook off Snow\u2019s hand. It was obvious that Zu An\u2019s earlier remark had affected her perception of Snow, too.This minor gesture was a critical blow to Snow.This scoundrel\u2026You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +300 Rage!Zu An shrugged casually and said, \u201cIf anyone\u2019s disgusting here, it should be that human-shaped shitmaker over there, not me.\u201d\u201cShitmaker?!\u201d Snow felt blood rushing to her head and nearly fainted on the spot. For a moment there, she had an urge to say screw everything and obliterate that bastard before her right away. She had never hated someone so much before. If she could, she would dice up his body from head to toe.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +888 Rage!Even Yue Shan, who was silently walking ahead of them, shuddered a little upon hearing that insult. Our young master might be trash in other aspects, but his ability to provoke rage is really top-notch. There\u2019s probably no one in the whole of Brightmoon City who can hold a candle to him. For my mental stability, I should really try not to cross him in the future.\u201cEnough! Stop messing around, both of you. Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed causing a public spectacle here?\u201d Chu Chuyan could almost see smoke rising from Snow\u2019s head, so she quickly separated the two.Snow harrumphed impatiently and turned her head away. If I don\u2019t make this fellow beg for a quick death tonight, I\u2019ll renounce my own name!There was an old man standing by the entrance of the Chu clan. His clothes were prim and proper, such that it was impossible to find a single wrinkle anywhere. His hair was white, but it was combed neatly in place. His appearance reflected his austere personality.Zu An recognized the old man. He was the butler of the Chu Estate, Hong Zhong.Hong Zhong greeted Chu Chuyan with a bow, and she quickly greeted him accordingly too. The old man had loyally served the Chu clan for decades now, winning him the respect of everyone in the estate.After exchanging greetings, Hong Zhong began speaking. \u201cMaster has ordered me to bring the young master to the study once he returns.\u201dThen he turned around and led the way forward. Chu Chuyan shot a \u2018See!\u2019 glance at Zu An and followed Hong Zhong to the study.On the other hand, Zu An was a little surprised to see that Hong Zhong\u2019s attitude and tone were no different from before. The old man should have already heard about the conflict he had with Hong Xingying earlier in the day, so why did he seem completely unfazed?Seemingly having guessed Zu An\u2019s thoughts, Hong Zhong suddenly spoke up, \u201cYoung miss, young master, I already heard about Xingying\u2019s matter. That child has always been proud and reckless, and it was in a moment of folly that he crossed the young master. Allow me to apologize to the young master on his behalf. I hope you won\u2019t take this matter to heart. I\u2019ll teach him a lesson once he comes back.\u201d\u201cUncle Zhong, you\u2019re taking this matter too seriously. Zu An has his faults, too,\u201d Chu Chuyan quickly replied.Needless to say, Zu An was displeased by that response. What does this have to do with me? It\u2019s that proud fellow who keeps trying to mess around with me.He was just about to say something when Chu Chuyan shot him a piercing glare, leaving him no choice but to swallow his words. From the looks of it, Hong Zhong had a high standing in the Chu Estate.Fine. I\u2019ll let this go, since you\u2019re my wife.Hong Zhong shook his head and added, \u201cI know that child well. He harbors some overboard thoughts, so it\u2019s inevitable that he feels a little frustrated at the moment. Without a doubt, he was the one who started this conflict. Even though Master and Madame haven\u2019t said anything about this matter, I\u2019ve been feeling deeply guilty about it.\u201dHis words seemed to be spoken in earnest. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but wonder how someone as upright and honest as Hong Zhong could possibly raise such a narrow-minded son. Out of consideration of Hong Zhong\u2019s sincerity, he decided he wouldn\u2019t exact vengeance on Hong Xingying, as long as he didn\u2019t mess with him anymore.Chu Chuyan responded accordingly, and with just a few words, she was able to quickly alleviate Hong Zhong\u2019s awkwardness. Afterward, she smoothly transitioned the conversation over to the Chu clan\u2019s businesses, and it didn\u2019t take long for the atmosphere to lighten.Zu An was still wondering how someone as cold as Chu Chuyan could properly manage the Chu clan\u2019s businesses, but he was starting to see the light now.Soon, the group arrived at the study, where Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru were waiting for them.\u201cZu An, the gall! The audacity! How dare you visit the casino so publicly? Not to mention, you even brought Chuyan with you!\u201d Qin Wanru slammed the table and glared at him angrily.You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +77 Rage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Zhongtian was in the midst of sipping his tea when the sudden table slam scared him, causing his tea to nearly spill. In order to conceal his awkwardness, he cleared his throat and went along with his wife. \u201cIndeed! Zu An, do you know what you\u2019ve done wrong?\u201dZu An inwardly scoffed at Chu Zhongtian for being a henpecked husband, but on the outside, he sincerely replied, \u201cI know that I\u2019ve done wrong.\u201dBoth Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru were taken aback by Zu An\u2019s response. They thought that the latter would try to rebut them, as he had done many times before, and they even thought up of lines to counter his rebuttals. Zu An\u2019s unexpected act of yielding deflated their air, leaving them suddenly at a loss about where to proceed with the conversation.Chu Chuyan and Yue Shan also exchanged glances, surprised by how obedient Zu An was being at the moment. Was this really the fellow who had dominated everyone else in the casino with his sharp mouth earlier?Qin Wanru pondered for a moment before deciding to go ahead with the script she prepared earlier. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that our Chu clan has rules forbidding our members from gambling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m unaware of it. I\u2019ve only realized it after hearing your words,\u201d Zu An lied without even batting an eyelid. He thumped his chest and guaranteed confidently, \u201cMother-in-law, please quell your rage. Don\u2019t let your anger harm your body. I promise to never walk into that sort of vile and depraved place in the future.\u201dJust how dumb must Mei Chaofeng be to allow him to enter the casino and continue winning their money? This promise was basically a no-brainer!Qin Wanru\u2019s air deflated once more. Zu An\u2019s oddly earnest attitude robbed her of her chance to use her prepared lines. So, she could only turn to glare at Chu Chuyan to berate her, \u201cYou should have warned him then! How could you go along with him?\u201dChu Chuyan hesitated for a moment, but in the end, she decided not to expose Zu An\u2019s lie. \u201cIt was my negligence.\u201dShe was worried that Zu An would be too severely punished, so she decided to carry some of the blame for him.Meanwhile, Snow was tempted to speak up, but she held her tongue in the end. I\u2019m going to take this fellow\u2019s life later at night anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether the Chu clan punishes him or not anymore.Needless to say, Qin Wanru could see through Chu Chuyan\u2019s attempt to cover for Zu An. Just what kind of sorcery has Zu An cast on my daughter to make her speak on his behalf so soon?She suddenly felt like her precious daughter had been stolen from her, which made her direct a sharp glare at Zu An.You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +33 Rage!This notification left Zu An taken aback. Even Chu Chuyan has already spoken up on my behalf, but you\u2019re still angry at me? Aren\u2019t you being too unreasonable here?That being said, he was more than happy to receive more Rage points. It was his key to growing stronger, after all.Chu Zhongtian coughed lightly before interjecting with a deep voice, \u201cThis matter has blown up by far too much this time around. We nearly got into a fight with the local guards. In the end, the main culprit who started this is still you\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Zu An took out a debt note and presented it. \u201cAllow me to offer this 7,500,000 silver taels to the two of you. Chuyan is my wife, which makes me her man. Naturally, anything I own belongs to the Chu clan too.\u201dBlack streaks appeared on Chu Chuyan\u2019s words. It was not that what Zu An said was wrong, but it sounded oddly jarring.Qin Wanru harrumphed in response. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare to accept your money. Our Chu clan prides itself on its incorruptibility. We have and will never touch dirty money earned through drugs, prostitution, and gambling. If we do take your money, outsiders will start gossiping about how our Chu clan has fallen to the extent where we need our son-in-law to gamble in order to help with our finances.\u201d\u201cIndeed. We can\u2019t ruin the good reputation the Chu clan has built up over several centuries over this. Keep your money well, and don\u2019t ever raise this matter again,\u201d added Chu Zhongtian.By the side, Snow heaved a sigh of relief. Even though she had guessed that this would be the case, she was still worried that the debt note would really fall into the Chu clan. If so, it would be terribly difficult for them to clean up the situation. It was gladdening to see that things were still going according to plan.Zu An kept the debt note back into his robe. In the end, you\u2019re just turning it down because it\u2019ll be hard to cash out this debt note. If there\u2019s really 7,500,000 silver taels laid out right before your eyes, I reckon that you wouldn\u2019t be able to remain so \u2018incorruptible\u2019.How much could the Chu clan possibly earn in a year? Before absolute profits, what does family rules count as?\u201cWhat a pity\u2026\u201dZu An was feeling troubled by this situation too. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to put this debt note to good use in his hand since he didn\u2019t have the ability to demand the Plum Blossom Sect to repay its debt. At most, he could only try to claim the annual interest.However, Mei Chaofeng was obviously not an honest person. One would really have to be naive to expect him to honestly fork out the interest. It was definite that he would try all sorts of things to shirk off the payment.\u201cYou have to be punished for whatever that happened today, or else we\u2019ll be sending out the wrong signal to the other clan members. The precedence you created might leave them with the wrong impression that it\u2019s no big deal to visit the casino!\u201d Qin Wanru slammed her fist on the table as she spoke. \u201cHead to the Reflection Room and copy our family rules 10,000 times!\u201d\u201c10,000 times?\u201d Zu An widened his eyes in disbelief. \u201cHow am I supposed to finish copying that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be grounded in the estate until you finish copying the family rules, lest you go around stirring trouble again,\u201d said Qin Wanru with a gleeful glint in her eyes.Hmph, don\u2019t think that I\u2019m unaware that you got Cheng Shouping to copy on your behalf the previous time. Now that you have to copy it 10,000 times, you won\u2019t be able to finish it even if you recruit his help. With this, you\u2019ll have no choice but to obediently remain in the estate for the next few nights.\u201cYou\u2019re dismissed. Head to the Reflection Room right away and start copying.\u201dUnder Qin Wanru\u2019s orders, Zu An had no choice but to depart with a bitter look on his face. After he was gone, Chu Chuyan couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMother, isn\u2019t 10,000 times too many? How long would it take for him to finish copying all of that?\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you sympathizing with him now?\u201d Qin Wanru harrumphed.\u201cWhen did I?\u201d Chu Chuyan\u2019s face reddened a little. Why in the world would I sympathize with that shameless fellow.It was then that Chu Zhongtian spoke up with a soft chuckle, \u201cChuyan, you need not worry. Your mother might have a sharp mouth, but she\u2019s a softie inside. It might look like she\u2019s punishing Zu An, but in truth, she\u2019s protecting him. Just think about it, would the Plum Blossom Sect let him off after suffering such a huge loss in his hands? If Zu An continues loitering around the city, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they make a move on him. By then, if we don\u2019t have any evidence on hand, we won\u2019t be able to exact vengeance for him.\u201cHowever, if he obediently remains in the estate, no matter how many connections the Plum Blossom Sect pulls, it wouldn\u2019t be able to bypass our guards to harm him.\u201dChu Chuyan widened her eyes in realization. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you have put so much thought into it. I should have thought deeper into the matter.\u201dA gentle smile finally emerged on Qin Wanru\u2019s stern face as she said, \u201cChuyan, you\u2019re far more talented than any one of us here. All you lack is just experience and time. In time to come, you\u2019ll eventually surpass the two of us.\u201dChu Chuyan replied with a smile, but her eyes reflected a slight hint of sorrow. By that time, my youth would have already been gone, and I\u2019d still be all alone.Zu An wasn\u2019t even on her list of consideration yet.\u2026Ah choo!Zu An rubbed his nose as he wondered which young lass is thinking about him.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re finally back!\u201d a young voice sounded as Cheng Shouping rushed over with two buns on his head.He heard that the young master had gone out with Snow this time around, and he wondered if he would bump into Snow if he rushed out. To his disappointment, the only person beside Zu An was the butler, Hong Zhong.A sinister smile curled on Zu An\u2019s lips as he grabbed Cheng Shouping by his collar and said, \u201cYou came at a good time. Let\u2019s head off to copy the family rules together.\u201d\u201cAgain?\u201d Cheng Shouping\u2019s face immediately crumbled. \u201cHow many times do we need to copy this time around?\u201dZu An waved his hands casually with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not much. Just 10,000 times.\u201d\u201c10,000 times?\u201d Cheng Shouping leaped up in horror. Is our young master bad at Math? Or does he have some kind of misunderstanding about what 10,000 means?Just like that, the horrified Cheng Shouping was dragged all the way to the Reflection Room with Zu An and Hong Zhong. Once they arrived at their destination, Hong Zhong said, \u201cYoung master, please do not leave the Reflection Room until you\u2019re done copying the family rules.\u201dAfter saying those words, he left the area, leaving Zu An and Cheng Shouping to stare at one another.\u201cYoung master, please spare me. I can\u2019t possibly copy the family rules 10,000 times!\u201d Cheng Shouping was determined not to help Zu An this time around no matter what the latter said. He was still traumatized by how he was tricked to copy the family rules all alone for the entire night.\u201cC\u2019mon. Who else is going to help me if not you?\u201d Zu An wrapped his arms around Cheng Shouping\u2019s shoulders as he nudged the latter with a smile.\u201cHmph, I refuse!\u201d Cheng Shouping shook his head adamantly.Seeing this, Zu An sighed deeply before taking out a banknote. \u201cHaaa, I was still thinking of rewarding you 100 silver taels if you were to help me with this task. However, since you aren\u2019t willing to do so, I\u2019ve no choice but to look for someone else then.\u201dWhile the debt note of 7,500,000 silver taels hadn\u2019t been cashed out yet, he did manage to take away 150,000 silver taels from the casino earlier. From this perspective, his trip to the Silverhook Casino was fruitful.Cheng Shouping\u2019s eyes lit up. His hand reached out to swipe the banknote before a fawning smile emerged on his face. \u201cAs the study companion of the young master, how can I possibly allow someone else to wait upon you? It\u2019s only normal for me to do it.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll leave it to you then. I\u2019ll be heading off to sleep now.\u201d Zu An yawned a little. It turned out that his short walk outside was quite draining on him.However, a tight knot formed on Cheng Shouping\u2019s forehead as he said, \u201cBut young master, I can\u2019t copy 10,000 times alone!\u201dZu An rolled his eyes and replied, \u201cWhy do you think I gave you 100 silver taels? Don\u2019t you know how to take the money to the other study companions in the estate to get their help?\u201dChegn Shouping\u2019s eyes lit up in realization. A moment later, however, he frowned. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t the money I have for myself be reduced then?\u201dZu An shrugged casually. \u201cI already gave you the money. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to copy it on your own or get others to help you; you just have to finish copying the family rules 10,000 times.\u201dAfter saying those words, he strutted away gleefully, leaving the conflicted Cheng Shouping behind.On the way back to his residence, Zu An began calculating the amount of Rage points he had earned. Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands\u2026Holy! I managed to get 60,224 Rage points!A bright smile broke out on Zu An\u2019s face. Thinking about all he had been through today, he felt that it was much better to play the antagonist than the protagonist.Returning back to the residence, he was just about to wash his face and prepare drawing the lottery when a voice suddenly sounded behind him.\u201cHow did you manage to do it?\u201dZu An leaped in shock. He hurriedly turned around to take a look, only to see the feeble Old Mi suddenly appearing right behind him.What the hell! This fellow looks as if he would crumble in the face of the wind, but he walks around without making a sound at all. Even after I raised my cultivation by so much, I\u2019m still unable to sense his presence at all!\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Zu An quickly replied, not daring to pull his weight before Old Mi. He was able to act fearlessly before others to earn Rage points, but for some reason, he couldn\u2019t help but feel subconsciously intimidated by Old Mi. He dared not to provoke the latter at all.Why is that so?Zu An pondered over the question for a long while, but he was unable to come up with an answer.\u201cThe entire estate has been talking about how you managed to win 7,500,000 silver taels from the casino. How did you manage to do it?\u201d Old Mi eyed Zu An with small beady eyes filled with curiosity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZu An blinked his eyes. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because of my good luck?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. He did win the bets due to his good luck, just that he didn\u2019t specify the deeper reason behind his good luck.\u201cGood luck?\u201d Old Mi frowned. Clearly, such an answer didn\u2019t satisfy him.\u201cWhat else could it possibly be? I can\u2019t possibly cheat under the eyelids of those veteran dealers of the Silverhook Casino, right?\u201d replied Zu An.Old Mi thought that those words made sense. He did know the limits of Zu An\u2019s capability, so he decided to let the matter go and leave the room. However, before walking out of the door, he said, \u201cFor the next few days, don\u2019t head out if you don\u2019t need to. You have a debt note of 7,500,000 silver taels on the Pum Blossom Sect. They won\u2019t let you off that easily.\u201dZu An felt a surge of warmth in his heart as he wondered if he had misunderstood this old man. Looks like he still cares for me. He doesn\u2019t covet my wealth despite knowing that I\u2019ve struck it rich.Little did Zu An know that there was no need for Old Mi to covet his wealth. After all, the money would all be his once he possessed Zu An\u2019s body in the future.Once Old Mi left the room, Zu An quickly closed the door shut and double-checked that there was no one else in the room before washing his hands and face. With that, he was ready to start drawing the lottery.He took out the keyboard and prepared himself to press down on the \u2018Enter\u2019 key, but he suddenly noticed that there were some changes with the keyboard. Taking a closer look, he noticed that there was a notification.You have successfully accumulated a total of 100,000 Rage points. The \u2018Alphabet\u2019 will be unlocked for the lottery drawing.Zu An was stunned for a moment before frenzied joy broke out in his heart. Didn\u2019t this mean that he could draw items from the alphabet now? One must know that the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delight and Poison Prick might look like troll items at first glance, but they were actually incredibly useful. It was likely that any random tools he obtained from the keyboard would be pretty decent.With anticipation welling up in his heart, he started the lottery.Unsurprisingly, the result was \u2018Thanks for playing!\u2019, but that did little to dampen Zu An\u2019s excitement. He had seen with his own eyes the light marker moving across the alphabets on the keyboard, which proved that it was possible to draw something on them.So, he continued the lottery without any hesitation.Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!\u2026Congratulations, you have won a \u2018Ki Fruit\u2019!\u2026Thanks for playing!Thanks for playing!\u2026Soon, Zu An was able to come to a conclusion. The chances of drawing a Ki Fruit were around 1-in-10 whereas the probabilities of drawing a Poison Bottle, Fortune Pill, and Faith in Brother Spring were uncertain.Some time later, Zu An\u2019s excitement started to fade. He hadn\u2019t received anything else other than \u2018Thanks for playing!\u2019 and Ki Fruits thus far.I have enough Rage points to draw the lottery 602 times. I can\u2019t be so unlucky as to be unable to draw anything new at all, right?As soon as this thought arose in Zu An\u2019s mind, he quickly slammed his palm on the nearby wooden table and shook the thought with his head. What in the world am I doing here? Touchwood! I can\u2019t be raising flags like that!Fortunately, on his 500th or something draw, the light marker finally stopped on the alphabet \u2018D\u2019.What could it be?With a heart filled with anticipation, Zu An quickly looked at the item he had received, only to see a pair of thin transparent lenses that looked oddly like contact lenses.Congratulations, you have won a \u2018Knock-You-Up Eyes\u2019!\u201c???\u201d Zu An.The last few experiences had given Zu An a glimpse into the ridiculous naming sense of the keyboard, so he wasn\u2019t too surprised by the announcement. Instead, he quickly headed on to read its description.Knock-You-Up Eyes: Together with an expert who goes by the surname of Song\u2019s \u2018Thousand Li Chastity Robbing\u2019, this item is renowned as one of the \u2018Ultimate Insemination Duo\u2019.Artifact Effect: When you are wearing this item, you may select whether to activate the item\u2019s effect when you are staring at a target. As long as you exchange glances with the target, the latter will immediately experience the labor pains of delivering a 10-month-old child. This effect doesn\u2019t discriminate against gender or race, and it will last for an hour before the pain subsides. Uses: 3Black streaks flashed across Zu An\u2019s eyes. To be honest, he would prefer to obtain the \u2018Thosuand Li Chastity Robbing\u2019 skill instead. He had no idea who the expert was, but he was definitely worthy of respect.Still, this \u2018Knock-You-Up Eyes\u2019 looks pretty useless. It only makes the target feels pain; it doesn\u2019t deal any actual damage at all. What\u2019s the use if the individual is going to recover once the duration is over?It honestly feels more like voodoo magic to prank a friend\u2026But again, Zu An soon came to realize that this skill could work wonders during critical moments. He remembered reading a scientific study in his previous world that divided the level of pain experienced by a human into 10 levels, and the pain experienced during childbirth was used as the highest level. The scientists developed a machine that simulated the pain of childbirth, and many of the men who attempted it\u2014whether out of love for their wife or being forced into it as vengeance\u2014ended up crumbling to the floor, crying out loud.He could use this item to incapacitate his enemy during a critical moment in a battle and turn the tides around.It was just a pity that this item had a limit of 3 uses, which meant that he couldn\u2019t abuse it.Another thing he was wondering was if this item could work on multiple people at once. If he were to use this item in a situation where he was glaring at multiple people, would he be able to incapacitate them all at once?All sorts of imageries surfaced in his mind, and he broke out into deranged laughter.Anyway, Zu An turned his attention back to the lottery, but the light marker never fell on the alphabets anymore. All in all, he managed to draw 58 Ki Fruits.He swallowed the Ki Fruit one after another and relished in the feeling of ki gushing through his body. The second formation of the third formation swiftly began filling up with golden matter, but there wasn\u2019t enough ki to make it full. It eventually stopped at around two-thirds.Based on the Law of Fibonacci Sequence, the second formation needed 89 Ki Fruits. He had already filled it up a little previously, and adding in the 58 Ki Fruits he had just eaten, he would need around 20 more or so in order to make a breakthrough.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but feel a little frustrated. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to earn 60,000 Rage points, but it couldn\u2019t even fill up a single formation. On top of that, things would only get harder later on. It would take an astronomical sum of Rage points to fill up every single formation. He couldn\u2019t imagine just how long it would take for him to reach the higher cultivation ranks.He stretched his body a little to test out his newfound strength. Currently, he wielded the strength comparable to 200 grown men. He felt that he was becoming superhuman, but then, he recalled how the cars in his previous world boasted hundreds of horsepower. With the bit of strength he had, he wouldn\u2019t even match up to the force of a car traveling at maximum speed.But looking at it from another perspective, now that he had started comparing his physical ability with cars, he couldn\u2019t be considered as an ordinary mortal anymore. Once again, he found himself wondering just how terrifying the power of high-rank cultivators in this world was.To be honest, Zu An was lacking common sense on that aspect. Higher rank cultivators gained the power to tap into the raw ki around them, so it was no longer accurate to gauge them by \u2018humanpower\u2019 anymore.Having finished drawing his lottery, the bored Zu An decided to drop by the Reflection Room to see how Cheng Shouping was faring. He was a little curious to see how many people the latter had hired.But when he finally arrived at the entrance of the Reflection Room, he saw Cheng Shouping gritting his teeth as the brush in his hand flew swiftly around. He was all alone inside the room.\u201c\u2026\u201d Zu An.This fellow is really nuts for money! He can\u2019t even bear to take a bit of money out to hire someone else to help him. But since that\u2019s what he wants, so be it.So, Zu An turned around and returned back to his residence. He headed straight for his room, and just as he was about to enter it, he suddenly noticed a broken strand of hair on the wooden door latch and froze on the spot.Ever since he found out that someone on the Chu Estate was out for his life, he had been keeping his guard up. Every time he left his room, he would set up a small mechanism to check if someone had tried to sneak in\u2014and the mechanism had clearly been triggered.Right now, the question was whether the person who had snuck into his room was still inside.So, Zu An slipped the Poison Prick into his sleeves before carefully pushing the door open and heading in. It just so happened that he had just made a breakthrough and wanted to test out his strength.As soon as he walked in, a gust of wind assaulted him from behind. A black silhouette suddenly charged at him. The prepared Zu An quickly rolled away before directing the Poison Prick toward the black silhouette.The black silhouette didn\u2019t expect her assassination attempt to fail, and Zu An turned out to be faster than she thought. As a result, she failed to dodge in time and ended up getting stabbed.However, Zu An was hardly pleased with the situation at all. He sensed that the tip of the dagger had failed to pierce into the black silhouette\u2019s body.\u201cHm?\u201dThe black silhouette had already backed off several meters to crouch on top of a table. Her exclamation revealed her astonishment. Zu An\u2019s swift reflexes were at odds with the wastrel impression she had of him, and the dagger he brandished was actually sharp enough to pierce through her Ki Armor, slicing right through the fabric of her clothes. Had it not been for her swift movement, she would have already suffered some damage by now.Zu An was also assessing the black silhouette intently too. The latter was dressed in black cloth, and her hair had been carefully wrapped together to avoid giving away any hints of her identity. Nevertheless, from her crisp and pleasing voice, he could tell that he was a woman, likely a beautiful one at that.Her eyes were hidden beneath a veil, but Zu An was still able to discern something familiar from them. A spark flashed across his mind, and he remarked instinctively, \u201cSnow!\u201dThe black silhouette jolted at that name. She slowly took off her mask, revealing a frosty face. \u201cYou\u2019re actually a cultivator?\u201dZu An had reacted faster than any mortal possibly could earlier.In response, Zu An chuckled softly and replied, \u201cAren\u2019t you the same too?\u201d\u201cI always thought that you were a wastrel, but it turns out that you\u2019ve been putting on an act thus far. What are you scheming over here?\u201d Snow growled deeply.Zu An sighed deeply and replied, \u201cA powerful cultivator like you is actually serving as a mere maid in the Chu clan. I should be the one asking you what you\u2019re scheming.\u201d\u201cForget it, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re going to die tonight anyway!\u201d Snow harrumphed coldly.Zu An immediately refuted indignantly, \u201cAren\u2019t you a vicious one? We might have our differences, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we had once shared a bond of skinship with one another. As the saying goes, a day as a couple, a hundred days of gratitude\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Snow had already interjected in, \u201cShut up!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +444 Rage!That matter was a thorn in her heart. Every night, whenever she dreamt about how her pure body had been defiled by those vile hands, she would jolt awake in the middle of her sleep.Due to all of the verbal quips they had over the last few days, she subconsciously responded to Zu An\u2019s provocation reflexively, \u201cYou aren\u2019t even a man at all. Where do you find the courage to say such words?\u201dAs she said those words, she shot a disdainful glance between his legs, making sure to express her full scorn for him.She thought that her actions would either drive Zu An to a state of fury or make him wither in embarrassment, but unexpectedly, the latter was completely unfazed by the insult. \u201cEven though we didn\u2019t do it in the end, I reckon it can at least count as half a day of couplehood. That would equate to at least fifty days of gratitude. How can you be so heartless as to assassinate someone you owe fifty days of gratitude to?\u201dWhat the hell! Is that saying even supposed to work proportionately?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySnow felt like she was being driven crazy. She must have sinned deeply in her previous life for her to actually encounter such a fellow. \u201cNot only will I kill you today, but I\u2019ll also sever your tongue and feed it to the dogs!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +500 Rage!Zu An was still thinking of squeezing more Rage points out of her, but Snow had already darted forward to launch her second wave of attacks.\u201cFast!\u201dRealizing that he was unable to dodge in time, Zu An channeled every last bit of strength in his body to protect himself. Two fists clashed with one another. As if he had been rammed by an oncoming lorry, Zu An was immediately jolted flying before slamming into the wall. He felt like his hands were going to break apart from the sheer rebound.He quickly tried to rise back to his feet, only to vomit out a puddle of blood on the floor.How could such thin arms and legs wield so much strength?Snow was also equally surprised too. She looked at the red imprint on her own palm and thought back about the strength exerted by him earlier on, and she couldn\u2019t help but remark in astonishment, \u201cHm? You\u2019ve actually reached the third rank!\u201dMeanwhile, Zu An felt like his innards were being wrecked, but he still put on a calm smile and said, \u201cDid you just realize that on top of my good looks, I\u2019m also an incredible cultivation prodigy, and you can\u2019t help but fall deeply in love with me?\u201d\u201cFall deeply in love, your head!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +211 Rage!With a darkened complexion, Snow rushed forward and kicked right into Zu An\u2019s abdomen, sending the latter tumbling a few rounds before finally coming to a halt.\u201cZu wastrel, you have really managed to provoke my ire today. I won\u2019t let you get off the hook easily today. I\u2019ll make sure that you suffer so much that you would wish that you\u2019re dead!\u201dThis lass sure knows how to bear a grudge. Zu An silently took out the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights and prepared to activate it, only to freeze in place right after. He belatedly realized a problem here.Right now, he had a debt note worth a hulking 7,500,000 silver taels on him. There were probably only a handful of people who were richer than him in Brightmoon City right now. Even if the 7,500,000 silver taels wasn\u2019t something he could cash out in the short-run, he still had 150,000 silver taels on hand right now.There was a condition to the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights\u2014the enemy must be a woman richer than him in order for its effects to be invoked.Surely a maid like Snow can\u2019t possibly be richer than me, right?The only reason why Zu An was able to keep calm all this while was due to this trump card he had on hand. One must know that he even managed to stand his ground against a fifth rank cultivator using the combination of the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights and the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra. No matter how powerful Snow was, surely she couldn\u2019t be more formidable than renowned prodigy Pei Mianman, right?He would have never imagined that his newly-found wealth would actually become his own downfall. In the blink of an eye, he found himself in a precarious situation.Unwilling to give up just like that, Zu An asked out loud, \u201cHey, can I ask you a question? How much money do you have?\u201dSnow was stunned. She had thought of many possibilities, but she didn\u2019t think that Zu An would ask him such an abstract question. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business. You just have to know that I\u2019ll be very rich once I kill you.\u201dThat response provoked a deep sigh from Zu An. From the looks of it, he couldn\u2019t rely on the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights anymore. This item was his strongest trump card, and he couldn\u2019t bear to waste it on an uncertain use.\u201cWhy do you want to kill me?\u201d Zu An\u2019s mind quickly whirred to action as he tried to think of a countermeasure. He was hoping to extract some information from Snow\u2019s mouth while the latter was overwhelmed with glee.\u201cA despicable and shameless scum like you deserves not to live on the face of this world!\u201d Snow spat out angrily.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +99 Rage!Zu An was stunned. He didn\u2019t think that Snow\u2019s grudge toward him would actually run this deep. Is it really possible to hate someone as handsome as me so deeply?\u201cAre you trying to stall for time? Don\u2019t even dream about it!\u201d Snow harrumphed coldly as she charged forth once more. She felt that she should first rip off Zu An\u2019s limbs so as to be safe.Unexpectedly, Zu An actually managed to avoid her attack by flipping over. After that, the two of them continued trading a few blows, and Zu An would be left spurting blood each and every time, but oddly enough, the latter seemed to be getting stronger and faster despite the increasing severity of his injuries. In fact, Zu An was almost getting close to her level now.Zu An knew that this was the effect of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra. He would be able to exert an extraordinary amount of force when he was severely injured, but without the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights to maintain his health bar, he really didn\u2019t know when he would exceed his limit and drop dead. Thus, he was prepared to summon and use Faith in Brother Spring as soon as he felt that he was at his limit.\u201cDid you learn some sort of secret art?\u201d asked Snow.There were techniques that granted a cultivator a huge leap in strength within a short period of time, but they tended to come with overwhelming negative side effects.\u201cIf you call me \u2018big brother\u2019, I\u2019ll consider letting you in on the secret,\u201d said Zu An with a chuckle.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +111 Rage!\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dA silver needle suddenly appeared in Snow\u2019s hand, and all of a sudden, Zu An found a barrage of needles flying in his direction.\u201cThe hell! A hidden weapon?\u201dZu An desperately tried to dodge the attacks, but he still ended up getting pierced by quite a number of them. Fresh blood wouldn\u2019t stop trickling down from his wounds, and he even lost grip of the dagger in his hand. With a loud \u2018dang!\u2019, it fell to the ground.\u201cYou have strength, but you know not of combat skills. You\u2019re nothing more than a fat pig waiting to be slaughtered!\u201d Snow sneered coldly.Zu An fell into silence. Was the barrage of needles a combat skill? I haven\u2019t learned anything of that sort yet, but if I could grasp some of them, I might be able to exert far greater prowess with the same physical limitations.\u201cA trash will forever remain a trash. I\u2019ve no idea how you managed to cultivate, but it all comes to an end here.\u201d A cold sneer sat on Snow\u2019s lips. \u201cAny last words?\u201dZu An spat a mouthful of bloodied saliva before chuckling. \u201cYou stabbed me with your needles today. I\u2019ll make sure to return the favor and stab you back hard one day.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can use needles\u2026\u201d The smile on Snow\u2019s face suddenly vanished halfway through her words as the innuendo finally sunk in, and her face turned wintry cold. \u201cI really don\u2019t know whether I should be impressed with you or not. Even on your dying breath, you still want to take advantage of me.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +404 Rage!Zu An wiped off the bloodied trail on his lips before looking at her with a bizarre gaze. \u201cHow do you know I\u2019ll die?\u201d\u201cDo you have any other trump cards then? Take them out and impress me then!\u201d scoffed Snow.\u201cI\u2019m just afraid that you won\u2019t be able to bear it.\u201d Zu An had hardly any strength left in his body. He had to lean against the wall just to maintain his posture. \u201cHave you ever been pregnant before?\u201dSnow widened her eyes in bewilderment for a moment before her rage flurried furiously. \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +303 Rage!How could a man ask a maiden like her whether she had been pregnant before? Snow made up her mind to tear off Zu An\u2019s tendons so as to vent her anger.On the other hand, a sinister smile emerged on Zu An\u2019s lips as he said, \u201cI can make you pregnant.\u201dSnow was already numb to Zu An\u2019s taunts by this point. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get angry anymore, especially not at someone who was going to die very soon.She walked right up to him and gazed down at him from above. \u201cHand the debt note over, and maybe I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dHalfway through her words, she suddenly froze up. Then, she subconsciously touched her tummy. What\u2019s going on? Why does my stomach suddenly feel so bloated?She quickly looked down at her stomach, but it was still completely flat. Then, her body suddenly arched backward as an aching pain seeped into her back.\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201dSnow began to panic. She had never experienced these sensations before, and it had already transcended the realms of her understanding.Zu An responded with light laughter. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that I can make you pregnant? Did you take my words as a joke?\u201dIt was indeed impossible for him to turn the tables around with his own strength, so he could only resort to the Knock-You-Up Eyes. However, to his astonishment, the skill didn\u2019t produce intense labor pains right away. Instead, it started off with the sensations of pregnancy first. This subtle difference could spell a huge difference in a battle, so he would have to take note of it in the future.Needless to say, there was no way Snow would believe that she was really pregnant. In a moment of rage, she wanted to end Zu An\u2019s life there and then, but an excruciating pain suddenly burst forth in her abdomen.\u201cAH~\u201dShe tried her best to stifle her voice, but the pain had already transcended the level of being bearable. She was forced to immediately squat down, and she even felt an urge to roll on the spot.Seeing how Snow was clutching her abdomen in pain, her face pale and sweaty, Zu An immediately took advantage of this opening to leap on her. He had suffered quite a bit in the earlier part of the fight, so he dared not to give her a chance to make a comeback and hurriedly brawled her down, hoping to curb her in close-quarter.Shocked, Snow hurriedly raised her hand to push him away, but yet another wave of excruciating pain broke out in her abdomen, causing her movements to jerk to a halt. As a result, she ended up getting rammed to the ground.Snow was shocked to see herself pinned under Zu An\u2019s body. She quickly tried to retaliate by attacking his head, but the intense pain breaking loose in her abdomen left her unable to exert her strength properly.As soon as she raised her hand, Zu An had already pinned her wrist back down onto the ground. She tried to struggle, but for some reason, Zu An\u2019s strength didn\u2019t lose out to her at all, not to mention that she wasn\u2019t in the condition to exert the full extent of her prowess at all. On top of that, her awkward position made it hard for her to maneuver around.Due to all of these factors, her struggling did nothing but give Zu An more chances to take advantage of her body.Zu An had to admit that despite Snow\u2019s ferocious temper, she did have a good figure. It wasn\u2019t as exaggerated as Pei Mianman\u2019s, but her slim and soft body was refreshingly youthful.He actually couldn\u2019t bear to kill her in a moment\u2019s time.\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d asked Snow with a reddened face. She had already realized that her struggling did nothing but pleasure Zu An, so she stopped moving altogether.\u201cAs I\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m giving you a taste of what pregnancy feels like. Why don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d Looking at how the sheer pain had managed to incapacitate Snow, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but wonder how a man would react in response to it.\u201cShameless!\u201d Snow felt both humiliated and angered. Unaware of the existence of the Knock-You-Up Eyes, she thought that Zu An was just mocking her. After all, she only knew of one way to get pregnant in this world.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +798 Rage!\u201cSo, it\u2019s alright for you to kill me, but I\u2019m shameless for trying to retaliate?\u201d Zu An sneered coldly. \u201cSpeak, who\u2019s the one who sent you here?\u201dSnow turned her face sideward. She was silently gathering her ki to turn the tables around with a single blow, but whatever ki she tried to gather would dissipate whenever a new wave of labor pain set in.What\u2019s going on? This pain keeps coming back, and it\u2019s even growing stronger!As a young maiden, Snow couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined that this was a unique sensation experienced by mothers in childbirth.\u201cYou refuse to speak? I guess I\u2019ll take off your clothes and put you on exhibition before everyone in Brightmoon City then!\u201d said Zu An.\u201cYou dare!\u201d Snow was alarmed.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +444 Rage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBased on what she knew of Zu An, it was completely possible for this despicable and shameless scum to really do something like that. Just the thought of the sheer humiliation she would be put through left her in a fluster.She opened her mouth to say something, but a new wave of labor pains set in and reduced all of her words into pained moans.\u201cYou think I dare not do so?\u201d Zu An harrumphed coldly. He ripped off her outer garment and threatened imposingly, \u201cLet\u2019s try it out then!\u201dHe had tried searching her room before, but all he found was melon seeds and tidbits. After having spent some time in the Chu Estate, he was certain that it wasn\u2019t Chu Zhongtian, Qin Wanru, or Chu Chuyan who were out for his life. That suggested that there was someone else behind Snow.Being eyed by an enemy he knew not of was simply too dangerous\u2014he didn\u2019t even know who he should put up his guard against! So, he was determined to figure out who the mastermind was today, or else he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep in peace anymore.Ripping off Snow\u2019s garment revealed her fair and slender arms. Even Zu An had to admit that her name was quite apt for her appearance. Her skin was really as fair as snow,\u201cI\u2019ll definitely kill\u2026 Aiyooo~\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +998 Rage!\u201cAre you still not going to speak? I should duly inform you that there isn\u2019t that much to take off from you anymore\u2026 Wait a minute, are you doing this on purpose to seduce me?\u201dSeduce, your head!You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +1024 Rage!Snow was really on the verge of going insane. As if the inhuman pain coming from her abdomen wasn\u2019t enough, she still had to be tortured by his words too. Just wait till I recover! I\u2019ll surely rip your mouth off!\u201cIf you still refuse to talk, I\u2019m going to rip open your clothes.\u201d Zu An grabbed her collars, but he didn\u2019t make a move for real. His intent here was just to force her to reveal the mastermind who tried to kill him.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who forced my hand!\u201d It was then that a green glimmer shone from Snow\u2019s eyes, and her words also became chillingly cold.Zu An\u2019s goosebumps immediately rose up. Without any hesitation, he summoned Grandgale and to move tens of meters away.At the same time, Snow\u2019s hair suddenly began growing along with the wind, as if its seal had finally been removed. Like vines, they darted forth in Zu An\u2019s direction.\u201cThe hell! What in the world is this?\u201d Zu An was horrified. It was as if the woman before him had suddenly turned into Medusa, exerting a terrifying pressure on him.Even the walls were ripped apart before the force of her hair, filling the room with holes. Had he not summoned Grandgale to teleport away earlier, he might have just been utterly decimated there and then.Snow also didn\u2019t expect that Zu An would back away so quickly, so she swiftly rushed out to chase after him.\u201cZu wastrel, I\u2019ll tear you into shreds\u2026 Aiyo~\u201d Snow collapsed by the door side as she clutched her stomach in pain.You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +500 Rage!Zu An gulped down a mouthful of saliva. Isn\u2019t this woman too scary? She\u2019s actually able to withstand the pain of childbirth to attack me! If she comes after me once more, I\u2019d really be in danger!It was then that a commotion sounded not too far away. Someone on the estate had finally heard the commotion and rushed over.Dilemma flickered across Snow\u2019s face, but in the end, she decided to stagger her way out of the estate. Right before she was able to leap onto the wall, she turned around and glared at Zu An hatefully. \u201cI\u2019ll be back!\u201dThen, she leaped upward and disappeared under the cover of the night.Not too long after she left, a silhouette suddenly flew over, descending with her fluttery white skirt like a fairy\u2014Chu Chuyan.She swiftly noticed the bloodied Zu An and recoiled in horror. \u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dZu An finally heaved a sigh of relief. He flashed her what he thought to be his suave smile before fainting in her embrace.He was already severely injured, but he was still forced to deplete all of his ki in order to summon Grandgale so as to avoid Snow\u2019s ultimate attack. He had been hanging on by sheer tenacity thus far, but Chu Chuyan\u2019s presence took away the tension in his body, resulting in him passing out on the spot.Chu Chuyan\u2019s first reaction toward Zu An falling into her embrace was to push him away, but looking at the injuries he was covered in, she ended up hesitating, which bought enough time for Zu An to fall into her arms.She thought about how the man had tried similar tricks to take advantage of her in the past, and a frown formed between her brows. If you\u2019re tricking me this time too\u2026However, those thoughts were swiftly vanquished once she checked his condition with her ki. To her shock, Zu An\u2019s life was really hanging on a thread.\u2026When Zu An finally regained his consciousness, he found that he was lying atop a bed, and there were many people gathered in the room. Other than Chu Chuyan, there was also Chu Zhongtian, Qin Wanru, and those from the second branch and third branch. Most of them were examining the marks on the wall caused by Snow\u2019s lashing hair as they clicked their tongues in amazement.It\u2019s fortunate that I kept Poison Prick back into the keyboard\u2019s space, or else it would be troublesome if one of them finds it and picks it up.Zu An realized that he was bandaged from head to toe, and he couldn\u2019t help but notice how he was constantly getting severely injured. This was definitely not the first time he was being bandaged like this.All of a sudden, he felt a warm handkerchief gently dabbing his face, wiping off his sweat. Taking a closer look, he realized that Chu Huanzhao was sitting by the bedside, taking care of him with a serious but worried look on her face.Zu An felt touched but conflicted at the same time. He noticed how Chu Chuyan was standing not too far away with a nonchalant look on her face, as if she had nothing to do with all of this. Her attitude made it seem as if he was someone else\u2019s husband. In the end, the one who cared the most for him was still his sister-in-law.Chu Huanzhao noticed that Zu An had opened his eyes and exclaimed in delight, \u201cFather, mother, big sister, he\u2019s awake!\u201dChu Zhongtian quickly rushed over and asked, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201dZu An took a look around before murmuring, \u201cIt hurts~\u201dChu Zhongtian nodded understandingly before adding, \u201cChuyan protected your pulse earlier with her ki, buying enough time for our physician to treat and bandage you. You were really in grave danger for a moment there.\u201dZu An was a little surprised to hear that. He took another look at Chu Chuyan, but her face still remained as impassive as ever. It was impossible to tell that she was the one who had saved her life. But still, it looks like I\u2019ve misunderstood her.Qin Wanru walked over and asked, \u201cWhat happened? How did you land yourself in such a state?\u201d\u201cSnow tried to kill me earlier,\u201d replied Zu An.It was a pity that he didn\u2019t manage to force Snow to reveal who her master was, but based on his interactions with Chu Chuyan and her parents, he felt that it was very unlikely to be them. Thus, he wasn\u2019t afraid to reveal the truth out loud.He made sure to pay careful heed to the reactions of the crowd around, hoping to see if he could discern anything. Unfortunately, there was no one who looked exceptionally suspicious to him.\u201cSnow?\u201d Zu An\u2019s words shocked everyone, and they subconsciously turned their gazes to Chu Chuyan.Even Chu Huanzhao also panicked at that revelation. \u201cBrother-in-law, how could my big sister possibly make an attempt at your life?\u201dZu An rolled his eyes in response. \u201cI\u2019m quite certain I said Snow instead of your big sister.\u201dChu Huanzhao was full of retorts toward that remark. But Snow is my big sister\u2019s personal maidservant. Isn\u2019t it normal for everyone to doubt her if you say it in such a manner?Faced with everyone\u2019s gazes, Chu Chuyan frowned a little too. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Snow around since a while ago.\u201d\u201cMen, get Snow over!\u201d ordered Chu Zhongtian authoritatively.He wasn\u2019t going to indict Snow just because of what Zu An said. After all, Snow was his daughter\u2019s personal maidservant, so there was still a need to investigate this matter properly.However, the servants soon returned and reported, \u201cSnow is not in the estate at the moment. We aren\u2019t able to find her anywhere.\u201dChu Zhongtian\u2019s face darkened. From the looks of it, it would seem that Snow had escaped from the estate knowing that she had been exposed.\u201cWhat happened earlier on? Fill us in on the details.\u201d Qin Wanru sat down by the bedside, allowing her silk dress to flow gently along the curves of her waist and bum. Her figure provoked glances from the second branch\u2019s Chu Tiesheng.Zu An briefly explained what he had experienced earlier, though he wisely chose to conceal his abilities.The frown on Qin Wanru\u2019s forehead tightened upon hearing the story. Chu Tiesheng couldn\u2019t help but remark, \u201cSounds like a load of nonsense. If Snow really intends to kill you, how could a trash\u2026 I mean, how could you have possibly been able to fend against her?\u201dZu An shot him a glance as he wondered if Chu Tiesheng was actually the mastermind behind Snow. However, if that was really the case, it would be rather foolish of him to speak up for Snow at a time like this.Chu Huanzhao stood forward and spoke on Zu An\u2019s behalf, \u201cMy brother-in-law is more formidable than you have imagined. He suffered several strikes from my Wailing Whip without even letting out a cry, and he even rendered a group of third rank and fifth rank cultivators helpless before him in the academy earlier today.\u201dThere was no one present who believed in her words. It was simply too ridiculous. It was one thing for Zu An to be able to stand his ground against third rank cultivators, but she actually spoke of fifth rank cultivators here too!The third branch\u2019s Chu Yuepo burst out laughing. \u201cLil\u2019 Zhao, you\u2019re simply too kind! How could he possibly have the strength to deal with a fifth rank cultivator? Would anyone even believe that?\u201dChu Tiesheng also nodded in agreement. \u201cIndeed. I realized that you have been speaking up for Zu An all this while. I think that you should maintain an appropriate distance from him, or else it might spur rumors. This is especially important given how the two of you shared a bed during the nuptial night\u2026\u201dQin Wanru immediately glared at Chu Tiesheng and bellowed, \u201cWatch your mouth! Are those words something that should be coming out from the mouth of an elder? She\u2019s still young, and she\u2019s only speaking up for Zu An as a fellow family member. You better not try to twist her words with that dirty mind of yours!\u201dThe embarrassed Chu Tiesheng turned his head away with a harrumph. \u201cI was just worried about the Chu clan\u2019s reputation.\u201dAs much as Qin Wanru disliked Chu Tiesheng\u2019s words, she had to admit that there was some sense in what he had said. Her second daughter had indeed been too close to Zu An in recent days.She couldn\u2019t possibly have fallen in love with him, right?As soon as this thought surfaced in Qin Wanru\u2019s mind, she quickly refuted it. How could that be possible? Zu An doesn\u2019t have a single quality that could win a woman\u2019s heart, so how could Huanzhao possibly fall for him?Qin Wanru knew that her second daughter was a rowdy one, so Zu An\u2019s antics probably just looked interesting to her. After all, Chu Huanzhao didn\u2019t have anyone to play with in the Chu Estate over the years.While Qin Wanru felt that it was impossible for the two of them to become a thing, she felt that she should find some time to talk to her second daughter about this and have them keep some distance away from one another.\u201cBased on what Zu An\u2019s earlier description, Snow should be a fifth rank wood element cultivator.\u201d Chu Zhongtian examined the marks on the walls before remarking deeply.Wood element?Zu An recalled how Snow\u2019s hair had wreaked havoc around the room, and for a moment there, he thought that she could be Medusa\u2019s incarnation.\u201cFifth rank?\u201d A huge commotion broke out in the room.None of them could have imagined that obediently little lass who was often caught snacking on melon seeds would actually be a fifth rank cultivator.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing that everyone\u2019s eyes were on him, Zu An unhurriedly responded, \u201cHer stomach suddenly started hurting halfway through, or else I would really have been dead.\u201d\u201cHurting?\u201dThe crowd was stunned. They didn\u2019t expect to hear such a childish excuse. A fifth rank cultivator actually suddenly had a stomachache in the midst of a battle and failed to kill a mortal\u2014no, someone who was even weaker than an ordinary mortal. That was simply inconceivable.While everyone was doubting Zu An, Chu Chuyan suddenly spoke up, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying.\u201d\u201c???\u201dThose words brought confused gazes upon Chu Chuyan.Qin Wanru frowned a little, wondering if her daughter was speaking up for Zu An out of consideration of their marriage.\u201cActually, I\u2019ve long realized that there\u2019s something wrong with Snow. She has hidden it well, but after the time we have spent together, it\u2019s inevitable that she would let things slip from time to time. The reason why I didn\u2019t say it out loud is because I wanted to investigate the person behind her. However, I don\u2019t understand why she would make a move on you.\u201dChu Chuyan turned to look at Zu An questioningly.She commanded a composed disposition, and her words were slow and unhurried. Yet, for some reason, her leisurely attitude didn\u2019t provoke one\u2019s ire. Instead, it simply felt like it ought to be the case.\u201cI don\u2019t understand it either,\u201d replied Zu An innocently. Had I known that you weren\u2019t the one behind her, I would have exposed her right from the start. I wouldn\u2019t have to feel so jittery for so long around her.The crowd was surprised to hear Chu Chuyan\u2019s words. They were surprised by how well Snow had concealed her identity, and at the same time, they couldn\u2019t help but wonder who the mastermind behind her was. No one else doubted what Zu An had said anymore.Chu Zhongtian interjected with a cough before turning to Zu An, saying, \u201cYou should recuperate from your injuries first. I\u2019ll send a few personal guards to protect you from now onward. We can\u2019t allow the same thing to happen again.\u201d\u201cPersonal guards? How personal are they going to be?\u201dFor some reason, Zu An\u2019s mind suddenly drifted to the beautiful bodyguards he had seen on dramas in his previous life.Chu Zhongtian calmly gestured to the buff men standing on attention by the doorway, shattering whatever unrealistic thought that was in Zu An\u2019s mind. He spoke some words of consolation to the latter before indicating for the others to leave the room so as to let Zu An get some rest.Chu Huanzhao was still reluctant to leave initially. She was bugging Zu An over the money he had won in the casino, feeling a little aggrieved that he didn\u2019t bring her along for something that fun.Qin Wanru had already walked out of the room, but when she noticed the conspicuous absence of her second daughter, she immediately turned around, only to see Chu Huanzhao acting chummy with Zu An. Once again, a frown formed on her forehead and she bellowed, \u201cHuanzhao, let\u2019s go!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for +3 +3 +3\u2026Zu An was amused by how hot-tempered his mother-in-law was. Are you afraid that I would steal your second daughter too? What are you so worried about? Is it because I\u2019m too good looking?It was only at the urging of her mother that Chu Huanzhao finally left reluctantly. Afterward, Chu Chuyan also walked out of the room with a brooding look on her face.Once everyone was gone, Zu An took a look at the Rage points he had earned\u20146,929. Needless to say, most of them were from Snow.He didn\u2019t rush into drawing the lottery this time around. Based on his previous experiences, he still had too few Rage points at the moment to draw anything good. He might as well save up more. Perhaps, his luck might be better that way.Also, he was also a deep believer in the gambler\u2019s philosophy. Given that he had just drawn an item, there was no way he could draw another one right away.As his thoughts came up to this point, he couldn\u2019t help but feel deeply regretful that he ended up using the Knock-You-Up Eyes here. It\u2019s all Snow\u2019s fault! I really need to give a good walloping in the future!At the same time, he began contemplating over an extremely important question\u2014his wealth. He was far too rich at the moment for his own safety!What did 7,500,000 silver taels represent? Even in the whole wide world, there was probably less than a handful who was even richer than him.To be honest, the only reason why it worked out was because the Silverhook Casino thought that they had him on the hook and intentionally removed the betting limit. Had it been any other customer, the casino would have never allowed such a huge bet on the higher payout choices.Ultimately, this all could be traced back to Zu An\u2019s wastrel image affecting other\u2019s impression of him. The casino thought that it could take advantage of him, but they ended up doing themselves in.Anyway, back to the topic, the earlier fight with Snow had reminded him of a major consequence as a result of his victory at the casino\u2014he was no longer able to use the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights anymore!One of the requirements of the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights was that the other party had to be a woman richer than him, but now that he had a debt note worth 7,500,000 silver taels on him, there was no way he could hit the requirement anymore.The loss of this trump card could prove fatal to him. As important as money was, he treasured his life far more than that.If he had been able to cash out the 7,500,000 silver taels, he could recruit a group of top-notch experts to protect him. Yet, of all things, he had to receive a debt note instead. This made things much harder for him.He really had to think of a way to make himself poorer!That being said, while it was indeed unlikely for him to be able to fully cash out the debt note, it was not as if it was completely useless at all. It would be a waste to simply dump away such huge leverage he had over the Plum Blossom Sect. It would be best if he could get something out of it somehow.So, Zu An fell into deep thoughts. He wondered if he should emulate what he once saw in the movies and think of ways to squander his money. He actually had many ideas regarding that, but he soon shot them down one after another. He realized that it would be hard to realize most of the ideas he had in this world.While he was feeling deeply stressed, a shadow suddenly loomed over him. A hunched figure had suddenly appeared by the side of his bed, giving him the shock of his life. He hurriedly raised his head, only to see that it was Old Mi.\u201cElder, you keep appearing out of nowhere. One of these days, I\u2019ll really get a heart attack.\u201dAs Zu An said those words, he discreetly glanced at the doorway. Chu Zhongtian should have assigned some guards to protect him, but why did they still allow Old Mi to slip in?\u201cDon\u2019t bother looking. Those children can\u2019t possibly sense my presence,\u201d said Old Mi with a hint of smugness on his face.Zu An\u2019s face immediately turned bitter. \u201cIt looks like the Chu Estate is really lacking in talents. I heard them talking about how their guards were carefully selected but groomed, but it seems like it was all talk.\u201dOld Mi harrumphed in response to Zu An\u2019s grumble. \u201cWhat do you know? Just because they aren\u2019t able to stop me doesn\u2019t mean that they are helpless against other intruders. Those guards are actually quite decent. They would be enough to ensure your safety in Brightmoon City. Even if Snow returns, she won\u2019t be able to harm you under their protection. At the very least, they\u2019ll be enough to buy time for the arrival of reinforcements.\u201dZu An finally heaved a sigh of relief. It was only then that he finally felt the benefits of having a powerful backing. This is how it\u2019s supposed to be. As a young master of a ducal clan, it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to deal with my own enemies personally. I should have an army of guards to wallop anyone who stands in my way!\u201cI didn\u2019t think that something would happen as soon as I\u2019m gone. You need to be more careful in the future. Don\u2019t go around causing trouble anymore,\u201d instructed Old Mi.Zu An felt a surge of warmth in his heart. He didn\u2019t think that Old Mi would be so concerned about his safety. \u201cThank you for your concern, elder. I\u2019ll be more careful in the future.\u201dOld Mi replied with a nod before walking over to the bedside to feel Zu An\u2019s pulse. \u201cYour injuries are a little severe, but it\u2019s fortunate that there isn\u2019t any lasting problem after the prompt treatment you received. Also, it seems like your cultivation has risen quite a bit due to this encounter too.\u201dZu An hadn\u2019t been able to check on his own condition earlier. He quickly inspected his own condition and noticed that the second formation had been completely filled, and the third formation was around one-third full. This meant that he had reached the third step of the third rank.He had to eat 58 Ki Fruits just to fill the second formation by two-thirds, and the third formation was bound to require more\u2014to be exact, 144 of them. That equated to 150,000 Rage points or so.So far, the most he had earned in a single setting was around 60,000 to 70,000 Rage points, and that was when he had the support of a crowd around him. Such opportunities were actually rare, and he didn\u2019t have the confidence that he would be able to pull it out often.On the other hand, the injuries he suffered from fighting with Snow earlier, through the effects of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, raised his cultivation by the equivalent of 80 Ki Fruits. That was far more than any Rage points he had earned in a single event.However, the entire situation was like walking on a tightrope between two tall mountains\u2014it was simply too dangerous! All it took was a moment of carelessness for him to fall to his death!One must know that this was real life; he couldn\u2019t just set a save point and restart if things went awry. It was simply too dangerous to rely on the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra to raise his cultivation. At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t rely on it unless he was really desperate.Anyway, Old Mi continued to relay some instructions to Zu An before leaving the room. Oddly enough, even though he was looking at the hunched old man all this while, he realized that he wasn\u2019t sure how the latter even walked out of the room. Once again, he affirmed his view that Old Mi was truly an unfathomable expert.Once Zu An was left alone in the room, he began to devote his attention toward how he should squander off the fortune he had just earned.\u2026Meanwhile, in a courtyard several li away, a teacup was smashed to the ground with a loud \u2018clink\u2019.A beautiful figure was rolling around restlessly on her bed, grabbing her blanket tightly. Her hair was completely soaked in sweat, and her maidenly face was scrunched in pain. \u201cZu An, I swear that I\u2019m going to take your life if that\u2019s the last thing I\u2019ll do!\u201dOf course, this person was no other than Snow.She knew that she had already alarmed the members of the Chu clan, and her abdomen was simply hurting too much, so she dared not to return. Instead, she escaped into a residence she had prepared beforehand.She was confident in pulling off today\u2019s assassination, but who could have thought that she would end up getting done in by that scum? Just what kind of sorcery did that bastard cast on me to make me suffer such unbearable pain?She even suspected that it was some kind of hidden injuries she had incurred unknowingly. She found it hard to believe that Zu An had the ability to pull off something like this.Regardless of what the truth was, it was a fact that she had failed, and it would be safe to assume that her identity as a spy in the Chu clan had been revealed too. She had put an unimaginable amount of effort in order to infiltrate the Chu clan, but she ended up failing her mission just because of a mere ant. This turn of events made her feel so indignant that it was driving her insane.Some time later, the unbearable pain suddenly vanished without a trace. It wasn\u2019t a gradual recovery but an instantaneous disappearance.A second ago, Snow was still rolling around the bed, and in the next, the pain had already flown away.She initially thought that she must be hallucinating, but when the pain didn\u2019t return after some time, her heart was finally put at ease.So, what in the world was that?Snow rose from her bed and wiped off the cold sweat trickling down her face. She felt incredibly fatigued, and her clothes were completely soaked too.She quickly grabbed a new pair of clothes and changed into it. She felt that she should get her condition checked at a physician in the off case that she had been inflicted with some sort of weird disease.However, for the time being, she had something more important to attend to. Once she was done changing into a fresh set of clothing, she hurriedly left the residence.\u2026Over at the headquarters of the Plum Blossom Sect, Mei Chaofeng widened his eyes in astonishment after listening to Snow\u2019s story. \u201cWhat? The assassination failed even though you had made a move personally?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She felt embarrassed to have actually failed to deal with someone of Zu An\u2019s caliber. \u201cI\u2019m also not sure what happened, but I suddenly felt unbearable pain in my abdomen. That fellow is simply too lucky to have encountered me in such a state.\u201dAs she said those words, she couldn\u2019t help but remember that this wasn\u2019t the first time that she was done in by Zu An.\u201cYeah, that fellow does have oddly good luck,\u201d replied Mei Chaofeng. Could someone who had won 7,500,000 silver taels from his casino in two rounds possibly have bad luck?Women really can\u2019t be trusted. Snow acts as if she owns the world, but she ended up messing everything up as soon as she gets down to business. If only I had known that she was this untrustworthy, I would have never written down the 7,500,000 silver taels debt note back then!It was out of trust in Snow that she would be able to easily take the debt note back from Zu An\u2019s hands that Mei Chaofeng relented and wrote the debt note back then. Yet, who could have thought that Snow would actually fail in her mission, leaving a huge pile of mess for him?\u201cLooks like I have to make a move personally then!\u201dA glint flashed across Mei Chaofeng\u2019s eyes.The 7,500,000 silver taels debt was like a curse that constantly plagued his mind no matter what he was doing. He couldn\u2019t help but worry about complications that could arise as a result of it. Things would still be manageable if the debt note remained in Zu An\u2019s hands, but what if Zu An were to pass it on to someone else?Snow hurriedly advised, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t act recklessly. After the recent incidents, the Chu clan would surely tighten its security and assign some personal guards to protect Zu An. Even if you make a move, the chances of success would be slim at best.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do then?\u201d Mei Chaofeng was exasperated. In the end, it was still this woman\u2019s fault for alarming the Chu clan. \u201cWe can\u2019t touch him in the Chu Estate, and it\u2019s even more impossible in the academy. In fact, I suspect that Plum Blossom Twelve\u2019s death might be the doing of the academy.\u201dHe suddenly recalled the report from Plum Blossom Thirteen that he saw Zu An chatting amicably with Shang Liuyu in the gazebo, and he couldn\u2019t help but think deeper into it, especially considering everything that had happened recently. He simply couldn\u2019t understand how a trash like Zu An managed to obtain the help of so many distinguished individuals.A smile crept onto Snow\u2019s pale face as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll arrange something soon. It won\u2019t take us long to drive him out of the academy.\u201dMei Chaofeng knew that Snow was a special envoy the young master had dispatched to Brightmoon City, so she had a lot of resources she could tap into if required. Thus, he didn\u2019t harbor any doubts about the credibility of her words.\u201cAs long as you can get that scum expelled from the academy, I\u2019ll personally make a move to ensure his death.\u201d After all that had happened, Mei Chaofeng dared not to delegate the matter to his subordinates anymore. He felt that there was a need for him to personally handle this problem so as to ensure that there was no more mishap.Snow also heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing that. \u201cWith Sect Master Mei making a move personally, that fellow\u2019s days are numbered!\u201dShe was confident of dealing with Zu An by herself too, but that excruciating abdominal pain she had suffered earlier on had left her traumatized. It was an experience she never wanted to go through ever again. Thus, she couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved to hear that Mei Chaofeng would be making a move personally.\u2026The following morning, Zu An woke up to the sight of a beaming Cheng Shouping standing right next to his bed. He recoiled in shock before asking warily, \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d\u201cYoung master, the Master has told me to inform you that you don\u2019t have to head to the academy today. You may stay at home to recuperate from your injuries,\u201d replied Cheng Shouping with a delighted smile.Zu An nodded in response before asking, \u201cIs that why you have that silly look on your face?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just feeling happy on young master\u2019s behalf. It looks like the Master and Madame regard you very highly. They even sent professional guards to your side in order to ensure your safety. This is a special treatment that even the young miss doesn\u2019t enjoy!\u201dAs Zu An became more valued in the Chu clan, Cheng Shouping, as Zu An\u2019s study companion, would become more valued as well. It looks like a brilliant future awaits me. I\u2019ll become the person everyone respects among the servants, and the maids will be desperate to fawn upon me. Even Snow\u2026Thinking about Snow, Cheng Shouping\u2019s smile suddenly froze in place. \u201cYoung master, was it really Snow who injured you last night? It\u2019s hard to imagine that such an adorable girl would actually be so ferocious.\u201dZu An glared at Cheng Shouping impatiently and berated, \u201cDo you think that I\u2019d lie to you about that? My father-in-law and my wife have already investigated the matter, and they concluded that Snow has infiltrated the Chu clan with ulterior motives. She\u2019s serving another master. Hm? It can\u2019t be that you have some sort of special relationship with her, right?\u201dCheng Shouping\u2019s expression immediately stiffened. He hurriedly waved his hands and said, \u201cNo no no, please don\u2019t misunderstand. I am completely unrelated to Snow. I knew that she wasn\u2019t a good person right from the start. Despite being the First Miss\u2019 maidservant, she dresses herself up and throws tantrums about as if she\u2019s the mistress of the estate. It looks like I was right after all; she\u2019s indeed a spy. If I were to see her on the street in the future, I\u2019ll surely bring her before you so that you can punish her accordingly!\u201dZu An was shocked by how Cheng Shouping was able to change his tune faster than even the most experienced of opera singers. If you really met Snow, all she needs to do is to whip her hair back and forth, and you\u2019ll be a goner. Tsk, you\u2019re really all say.\u201cCough cough~\u201dA series of light coughing suddenly sounded. Zu An raised his head, and when he saw Chu Chuyan standing by the doorway, a smile broke out on his face. \u201cMy wife does dote on me the most. She\u2019s the first one of the entire estate to specially come over and pay me a visit.\u201dCheng Shouping stared at Zu An grudgingly as he thought, Am I not a human to you? Of course, he dared not to put himself on the same pedestal as the First Miss, so he quickly stepped aside and invited Chu Chuyan in, \u201cFirst Miss, please.\u201dChu Chuyan was staring at the two of them by the doorway with a complicated look on her face. She heard the conversation between the two of them loud and clear. Birds of the same feather do flock together.Instead of walking into the room, she spoke by the doorway, \u201cDivine Physician Ji will be coming over to treat you later on. He\u2019s an eccentric person, so I came over to warn you to rein yourself in before him. Make sure that you don\u2019t offend him with your words.\u201dFrom the time they had spent together, she concluded that Zu An was a troublemaker through and through. It was as if his vile mouth existed for the sake of infuriating everyone around him. It would have still been fine if it was anyone else, but Divine Physician Ji was no ordinary man. She was worried that Zu An would land himself in a bad position before the Divine Physician Ji, so she came over to drop him a piece of advice.\u201cDivine Physician Ji? That\u2019s great!\u201dZu An was stunned for a moment before exploding in joy. He was still wondering if he should slip out today to look for Divine Physician Ji so as to enquire about how the preparations for the treatment of \u2018little Zu An\u2019 was coming along. However, the personal guards assigned to him were truly, in every sense of the word, personal. He couldn\u2019t shake them off at all! At the same time, he couldn\u2019t find any legitimate excuse for him to leave to Chu Estate too.But to his surprise, while he was feeling deeply frustrated over this matter, the Chu clan actually invited Divine Physician Ji over for him.Chu Chuyan was stunned for a moment before realization struck her. \u201cAh, I nearly forgot that you\u2019re acquainted with Ji Xiaoxi. There should be no problem then.\u201dShe had already heard about the matters that had transpired in the academy.\u201cHoney, Ji Xiaoxi and I are only friends. There\u2019s nothing going on between us.\u201d\u201cHm? Why are you clarifying that to me?\u201d Chu Chuyan was baffled.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be shy about that.\u201d Zu An chuckled. \u201cAn amazing man like me is bound to attract the attention of women no matter where I go, but honey, there\u2019s no need to get jealous. I swear that you\u2019re the only one I like. I\u2019d never do anything to let you down!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Chuyan.\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Shouping.\u201cSpeaking of which, honey, were you the one who specially invited Divine Physician Ji over for me? Ahh, my wife is really the best!\u201d Zu An walked over and made use of the moment to hold her hands.In the end, Chu Chuyan left the room with a livid face. I should have never dropped by this fellow\u2019s room!Menawhile, Cheng Shouping stared at Zu An with a complicated look in his eye. A long while later, he muttered, \u201cYoung master, I finally understand how you were able to marry the First Miss.\u201d\u201cIs that even a question at all? It\u2019s naturally due to my suave looks!\u201d Zu An harrumphed smugly.Cheng Shouping shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s because you\u2019re thick-skinned.\u201dZu An narrowed his eyes sharply. \u201cOh? Are you done copying the family rules?\u201dCheng Shouping immediately cowered out. He put on a fawning smile and replied, \u201cAh\u2026 Hahaha, not yet. I\u2019m still on my break.\u201d\u201cBreak, my ass! Hurry up and finish copying them!\u201d Zu An bellowed. \u201cI already gave you the money. You were the one who chose to scrooge out and not hire any helping hands!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll head over right now\u2026\u201d replied Cheng Shouping hurriedly. The young master is not just thick-skinned, he\u2019s narrow-minded too. I must pay heed to never offend him.Shortly after the grumbling Cheng Shouping left the room, the butler, Hong Zhong, brought Ji Dengtu into Zu An\u2019s room.\u201cDivine Physician Ji, this way please!\u201dHong Zhong was an austere person, and this was further highlighted by how he dressed. His hair was combed neatly in place such that not a single loose strand could be found, and his clothes were devoid of wrinkles. All of these gave him quite an imposing presence.But at his very moment, he was conducting himself humbly and respectfully.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but remember how Chu Chuyan had specially dropped by to warn him earlier. From the looks of it, it would appear that this licentious physicians was really quite a big deal.\u201cYoung master, this is Divine Physician Ji. He boasts incredible medical skills, so please do not offend him.\u201d Hong Zhong began introducing to the two men to one another. \u201cDivine Physician Ji, this is young master Zu An of our Chu clan. He was severely injured by a fifth rank cultivator last night. We\u2019ve already treated him on the manor last night, but we\u2019d like for you to take another look just to be safe.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Divine Physician Ji replied perfunctorily as he stroked his beard. His attitude was a little arrogant. However, when he finally caught sight of Zu An on the bed, his eyes immediately widened in astonishment.Hong Zhong was a little surprised by his reaction, so he quickly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Divine Physician Ji? Is there a problem here?\u201dDivine Physician Ji coughed lightly to conceal his surprise before saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to diagnose him now, and I need some privacy.\u201d\u201cYes, please go ahead. We\u2019ll be right outside, so feel free to give us a call if you have any need of us.\u201d Hong Zhong knew that Divine Physician Ji had quite a lot of rules when it came to treating a patient, so he didn\u2019t say anything about it. With a wave of his hand, he gestured for the other servants in the room to head out.Once they were all gone, Divine Physician Ji walked over to the bedside and sat down. He smacked his hand down on Zu An\u2019s thigh and said, \u201cNot bad! I didn\u2019t think that you would be able to escape from a fifth rank cultivator. You sure are a bag of surprises, aren\u2019t you?\u201dHis smack tugged at Zu An\u2019s wounds, causing the latter to gasp in pain.Zu An had a strong feeling that Divine Physician Ji was doing it on purpose. Didn\u2019t I just earn a few silver taels from your daughter back then? Do you really need to go this far?\u201cIt was just luck. She fled in a fluster when she noticed that the experts in the estate were rushing over. I only survived by a hair\u2019s breaddth,\u201d said Zu An in a mixture of truth and falsehood. There was no way he would reveal his trump cards to others.Divine Physician Ji nodded understandingly, \u201cDumb Chu is an eighth rank cultivator after all. It\u2019s normal for the assassin to fear him.\u201dHearing how Divine Physician Ji addressed Chu Zhongtian as \u2018Dumb Chu\u2019, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the two of them had some conflict with one another. Considering that perverted request Divine Physician Ji had made, could it be that\u2026 he had pursued Qin Wanru in his earlier years, only to have Chu Zhongtian beat him to it?That isn\u2019t right though. If that was the case, why would the Chu clan invite him over to treat him?Forget it, I have nothing to do with whatever grudges they have. What\u2019s important right now is for me to ask about that matter.\u201cDivine Physician Ji, have you found a cure yet?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on the street and check out who I am? How could I possibly be unable to cure you?\u201d Divine Physician Ji harrumphed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I already brought it here!\u201dZu An looked out of the door, and he could see Butler Hong and the other guards standing not too far away. He was a little hesitant to talk about in the presence of so many outsiders.Divine Physician Ji said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t be able to hear what we\u2019re saying.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What rank is this fellow at? From the way he speaks, he seems to be quite an incredible fellow. He must be pretty strong.However, the matter concerning \u2018little Zu An\u2019 was more important at the moment. So, he struggled up from his bed and rummaged through his cupboard. At the bottom of a pile of clothes, he took out a silk dudou. It was the one which he had \u2018borrowed\u2019 from Snow\u2019s room that other day.After how Snow tried to take his life, he had no qualm giving away her personal possessions to the perverted physician.On the other hand, seeing that Zu An still had the strength to get off the bed, Divine Physician Ji remarked in wonderment, \u201cYou have quite a unique constitution over there. Despite being so severely injured, you\u2019re still able to move on your own. It looks like you have managed to fool the entire Chu clan.\u201dZu An rolled his eyes. Of course. This concerns the latter half of my life\u2019s worth of bliss. Even if I can\u2019t walk, I would have still crawled my way over.\u201cHere, I got the thing you wanted. You should be able to treat me now, right?\u201dDivine Physician Ji subconsciously accepted the dudou, but after taking a closer look, he suddenly frowned. \u201cWhose is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Qin Wanru\u2019s.\u201d Zu An knew that Divine Physician Ji was no fool. If he were to say that the dudou belonged to what Shang Liuyu or Qiu Honglei, the latter would surely doubt him. After all, there was no way he could have gotten his hands on their personal possessions. The only one that he really stood a chance with was Qin Wanru.I\u2019m sorry, mother-in-law, but for the sake of the happiness of your daughter\u2019s marriage, I\u2019ll have to wrong you this once.Divine Physician Ji narrowed his eyes doubtfully. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t buy the dudou off the street to fool me?\u201dZu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but he didn\u2019t allow his nervousness to show on his face. He hardened his determination and carried on with the lie. \u201cLook at the material. Do you think that it\u2019s possible to buy such well-made good outside easily?\u201dDivine Physician Ji took a careful examination of the dudou before nodding in agreement. \u201cI guess so. The material is all top-quality, and it\u2019s indeed something that came from the Chu clan.\u201dZu An was bewildered. This fellow can actually tell whether a piece of underwear came from the Chu clan or not? You pervert! Just how many dudous have you stolen from the Chu clan over the years for you to be able to differentiate among them?\u201cI\u2019ve already done what you asked for. It\u2019s time for you to fulfill your end of the promise.\u201d Zu An looked at Divine Physician Ji expectantly as he spoke.The matter that he was the most concerned about at the moment was no other than this.Divine Physician Ji slipped the dudou into his own embrace before he said, \u201cI\u2019ve already found a way to remove the seal, but I\u2019m still lacking the main medicinal herb.\u201dZu An\u2019s face immediately darkened. \u201cAre you toying with me? I\u2019ve already brought the item you needed, but you\u2019re telling me that you aren\u2019t ready yet?\u201d\u201cDo you think that it\u2019s that easy to release the Great Yinyang Pulse Severing Palm? Even with my skills, I still had to look up over a hundred ancient manuals before I managed to find a reliable way to resolve your issue. The formula to forge the Spirit Root Unsealing Pill requires 81 rare medicinal herbs, and I\u2019ve already found 80 of them for you. However, there just happens to be one that I\u2019m having difficulties sourcing for,\u201d replied Divine Physician Ji.In truth, he did exaggerate matters by quite a bit. Most of the medicinal herbs were common ones that could be easily bought off the apothecary. The key to the treatment was actually the formula itself, which fused the essences of these common herbs in an ingenious manner to create something incredible.He didn\u2019t think that Zu An would be able to complete his mission so quickly, and it was due to him being caught off guard that he said those words. Of course, the matter about him lacking the main ingredient was the truth.Spirit Root Unsealing Pill?Zu An\u2019s eyelids twitched at the name. Wow, its name sure is straightforward, huh? \u201cWhat\u2019s the main ingredient you\u2019re lacking? No matter how much it costs, I\u2019ll buy it for you!\u201dHe had 150,000 silver taels with him at the moment, as well as a debt note that was worth 7,500,000 silver taels. With such wealth, he could definitely be considered a tycoon.Yet, Divine Physician Ji shook his head and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to buy the herb even if you have the money.\u201d\u201cWhat is it called? I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s anything in the world that money cannot achieve!\u201d exclaimed Zu An anxiously.\u201cThe medicinal herb is called the Evanescent Lotus. It\u2019s said to only flower once every thousand years, and its flower petals are rumored to possess the ability to raise a person\u2019s cultivation by a step. Do you think that something as precious as that can be valued with money?\u201d Divine Physician Ji shot \u2018noveau riche\u2019 Zu An a disdainful look.\u201cSomething like that exists in the world?\u201d Zu An was stunned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. There should be a difference in the amount of ki needed for a high-rank cultivator to make a breakthrough as compared to a low-rank cultivator, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what that makes it so mystical,\u201d replied Divine Physician Ji. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like some sort of law is at work here. The effect of the flower petals doesn\u2019t conform to the rules we know of. Regardless of whether one is a high-level cultivator or a low-level cultivator, a flower petal can indeed raise one\u2019s cultivation by a step.\u201d\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t cultivators keep the flower petal until they\u2019re strong before consuming it? No one would be so foolish as to waste such a precious treasure when they\u2019re still weaker,\u201d asked Zu An.\u201cWhat you said isn\u2019t wrong, but the world isn\u2019t always that convenient. Many cultivators die prematurely before reaching their peak, and the items they have often end up benefiting others instead,\u201d said Divine Physician Ji. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous world we live in, and there are many stumbling blocks in the path of cultivation. What\u2019s most important is still the present.\u201dZu An was surprised to hear those words. Is the world really that dangerous?\u201cOn top of that, the Evanescent Lotus only flowers for several hours. Once the perfect timing is missed, the lotus will wither, losing its miraculous effects. So, anyone who obtained it would always consume it right away. They wouldn\u2019t save it for the future,\u201d added Divine Physician Ji.\u201cCan\u2019t you have just said that right from the start?\u201d Zu An scoffed disdainfully. \u201cThen where can we find the Evanescent Lotus? Aren\u2019t there merchant associations out there who would get you whatever you needed as long as you\u2019re willing to pay them accordingly?\u201dIn the cultivation novels he had read in his previous life, there would always be some mysterious merchant association that would get you what you needed as long as you had the money. These mysterious merchant associations would often be incredibly powerful, not fearing the oppression of any of the other powers.\u201cThere are indeed such merchant associations,\u201d replied Divine Physician Ji. However, he soon shook his head before continuing on, \u201cThe problem is that the Evanescent Lotus is simply too rare. It only flowers once in a thousand years. Even I\u2019ve only read about it in the old records; I haven\u2019t seen it in person before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely that merchant associations would have them either.\u201dZu An immediately frowned upon hearing those words. \u201cWait a moment. You\u2019ve never seen it before? Then how do you know that the treatment will work? Is this a scam? Are you trying to get me to find the Evanescent Lotus for you so that you can use it to raise your cultivation?\u201dDivine Physician Ji immediately flew into a fit of rage. \u201cGo to the streets and ask around then! I, Ji Dengtu, am the very hallmark of professionalism here. Do I look like the kind of person who would do something like that?\u201dZu An couldn\u2019t help but recall how he caught Divine Physician Ji flipping through an erotic magazine, and he subconsciously nodded in response. \u201cYou do.\u201dThose words choked Divine Physician Ji up with anger. In the end, he turned his head away and harrumphed snappishly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have bothered treating you if not for Xiaoxi begging me to help you! I\u2019ll be frank with you, the Spirit Root Unsealing Pill is something I came up with after browsing through many old records. I might have never seen the Evanescent Lotus in person, but there are others who have. It\u2019s through using the notes they had left behind and the sharp intuition I have regarding medicine that I was able to come up with the formula.\u201d\u201cIn other words, the pill hasn\u2019t been proven to work yet?\u201d asked Zu An sharply.Divine Physician Ji was really angry this time around. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust in my medicinal skills? If that\u2019s the case, you should find someone else whom you trust instead!\u201dThen, he turned around and stomped off.Seeing this, Zu An quickly lurched forward to grab his hand before apologizing sheepishly, \u201cIt was just a passing remark. Divine Physician Ji, how could I possibly not trust you? Here, this is a small gift I\u2019ve prepared for you. Please quell your anger.\u201dAs he said those words, he secretively slipped a small booklet over.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Divine Physician Ji shot a disdainful glance at the booklet, seemingly not too interested in it.Zu An shot him a secretive smile as he nudged him lightly. \u201cJust take a look.\u201dEver since he saw Divine Physician Ji getting bought over by an erotic magazine, he immediately prepared one of his own in case he ever needed it in the future. He felt that there was no harm in getting close to Divine Physician Ji, especially since he was relying on the latter to treat \u2018little Zu An\u2019.Divine Physician Ji uninterestedly flipped the booklet open, only to see the following words written on the first page: Everyone has their own misfortunes\u2026He initially thought nothing about it, but as he read on, his breathing soon began to hasten. He swiftly kept the booklet into his robes. It\u2019s too wasteful to read good material like this early in the day. I should slowly appreciate it later at night.\u201cYou\u2019re quite a talented one, lad!\u201d Divine Physician Ji patted Zu An shoulders with an approving nod.Zu An heaved a sigh of relief before chuckling gleefully in his mind. You\u2019re already impressed with just this much? Hah! You\u2019ll be surprised if you know of the huge collection I have stored in my mind right now. It looks like people in this world are really lacking in entertainment choices.\u201cWhere did you manage to get such good stuff?\u201d asked Divine Physician Ji secretively.\u201cI heard it from a traveling monk.\u201d Zu An dared not claim that he was the one who wrote it. He wouldn\u2019t dare to raise his head on the streets anymore if it were to be known that he had written such stuff down.\u201cThat monk sure is\u2026\u201d Divine Physician Ji nodded in awe. Looks like monks haven\u2019t been spending their days meditating in vain after all. I sure have underestimated them. \u201cFor a moment there, I thought that you were the one who wrote this story. I would have really been impressed if you were able to write such an exciting story despite being unable to use your thing.\u201dZu An\u2019s face darkened. If not for the fact that I still need you to treat my affliction, I\u2019d have made sure to squeeze every single Rage point out of your body!\u201cIf the Evanescent Lotus is really as rare as you put it out to be, wouldn\u2019t that mean that it\u2019s a hopeless case for me?\u201d Zu An felt like his heart was falling into the abyss of despair.\u201cYou need not get so down. Since you\u2019ve offered me something good, I\u2019ll give you a clue.\u201d Ji Dengtu stroked his goatee leisurely, putting on the airs of an expert.\u201cYes, I\u2019d be deeply grateful if you could offer me some guidance.\u201d Zu An\u2019s attitude was so subservient that even he wasn\u2019t able to stand himself.\u201cI recently heard rumors that a stalk of Evanescent Lotus has been found in the Ursae Dungeon. Whether you\u2019ll be able to lay your hands on it or not, that would depend on your own capability,\u201d replied Ji Dengtu.\u201cUrsae Dungeon?\u201d Zu An was dumbfounded. He had no idea what that was.Ji Dengtu frowned. \u201cAren\u2019t you from Brightmoon Academy? Why don\u2019t you know about it?\u201d\u201cAm I supposed to know everything just because I\u2019m from Brightmoon Academy? I only enrolled there two days ago!\u201d exclaimed Zu An.Seeing that there was some sense in what Zu An said, Ji Dengtu finally began explaining, \u201cAs you can imagine, there are many formidable cultivators over there in the world. Over time, they have conquered new land and expanded human territories. However, the world is huge, and there are still many secrets that we have yet to uncover.\u201cEvery prefecture has some dungeons in its territory. No one knows where these dungeons come from, but their existence can be traced back to the oldest human records. It\u2019s almost they have been there since the inception of the world.\u201d There was an expectant look in Ji Dengtu\u2019s eyes as he spoke.\u201cRumors have it that these dungeons are small worlds created by ancient deities. Some of these small worlds look just like our world, but there are also those which are filled with danger but contain many fortuitous encounters.\u201dZu An nodded in response. Basically, it\u2019s just the same as the dungeons in games, right?\u201cHowever, as time passed, most of these dungeons fell under the control of the royal court, who then use them to nurture new batches of cultivators loyal to the royal court. In other words, only the students of official cultivator academies have the right to enter these dungeons,\u201d said Ji Dengtu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThe hell! The royal court is actually that domineering?\u201d remarked Zu An.He didn\u2019t have any notions of the royal court\u2019s power thus far, but Divine Physician Ji\u2019s words gave him some gauge of just how powerful the Great Zhou Dynasty was.Just from the sound of it, dungeons were likely to be places filled with fortuitous encounters and treasures. Cultivators who went in probably had a good chance of significantly raising their prowess. Yet, the royal court actually monopolized these invaluable resources.This tyranny would probably be met with great objections from sects and unaffiliated cultivators, and there would likely be many fights over it. Nevertheless, the royal court still managed to hold control of it, and everyone else was forced to acknowledge it.Either you submit to the royal court and join the academy, or else don\u2019t even dream of coveting the treasures in the dungeons.\u201cWhy do you think most of the experts in the world decided to take on roles in the royal court?\u201d Ji Dengtu chuckled in response.\u201cWait a moment, that isn\u2019t right.\u201d Zu An suddenly noticed a gap in logic. \u201cBased on what you\u2019ve said, the dungeons have already existed for a long time now. If cultivators have been visiting dungeons since the inception of time, surely all of the resources should have been emptied out by now?\u201dJi Dengtu shook his head and explained, \u201cYou\u2019re underestimating the scale of the dungeons. These dungeons are independent worlds with rules of their own, and many of them are of a size comparable to our world.\u201cThey have their own complete ecosystems, so many of the items in dungeons would regrow over time. It\u2019s similar to how an apple tree doesn\u2019t stop bearing fruit just because you pluck off an apple from it.\u201d\u201cBut if cultivators abuse the resources, they would still eventually run out,\u201d said Zu An.If the dungeons were under his control, he would have made sure to scrape out all of their resources to benefit himself. He didn\u2019t believe that there was no other cultivator before him who harbored such thoughts.\u201cAs I have told you, these dungeons are complete worlds of their own. There are even dungeons with different maps appearing randomly at times, such that only a very small part of them had been explored to date. It\u2019s simply not possible to empty out their resources.\u201d Ji Dengtu rolled his eyes. \u201cBesides, dungeons don\u2019t just remain constantly open. Most of them only open once in several years, and the duration they remain open can range from several days to several months.\u201dZu An nodded in realization. \u201cSo, you want me to enter the Ursus Dungeon to find the Evancescent Lotus? Based on what you\u2019ve said, the Evanescent Lotus should be an incredibly valuable resource coveted by many experts. How could someone like me possibly snatch it under the eyelids of those experts?\u201dJi Dengtu waved your hands. \u201cYou really are ignorant. In dungeons, it\u2019s not the strongest person who stumbles upon fortuitous encounters; it\u2019s the one who is blessed with luck. As long as you\u2019re lucky enough, the item will naturally appear right before you.\u201cThere are strong people who are born with bad luck, resulting in them missing by many fortuitous encounters. That being said, most experts do have good luck, or else they wouldn\u2019t have been able to attain the strong power they boast.\u201dA bitter look surfaced on Zu An\u2019s face. Had he known that this would be the case, he would have never wasted his Fortune Pill on the casino. He was really feeling deeply regretful.Noticing the look on Zu An\u2019s face, Ji Dengtu thought that he was worried about this matter, so he consoled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can tell that you\u2019re a person with great luck. After all, despite being an utter good-for-nothing, you were still chosen by Chu First Chu as her husband. As long as you can earn the rights to enter the dungeon, you might just be able to get something good out of it.\u201dOne thing that Ji Dengtu had neglected to mention was that something as valuable as the Evanescent Lotus was bound to be extremely rare. The chances of finding it were equivalent to trying to find a single needle in the vast ocean. In fact, he didn\u2019t think that it was possible for Zu An to obtain it at all. The only reason why he was saying all of this was so as to not tarnish his reputation.I have already given you the treatment method. There\u2019s nothing I can do if you can\u2019t find the last ingredient required, so don\u2019t point your fingers at me.Ji Dengtu thought about the booklet he had just received, and he suddenly felt a bit conscience-stricken. So, he took out a blue pill from his robe and passed it to Zu An. \u201cThis is the Spirit Root Unsealing Pill that I forged using the other 80 medicinal herbs. All that\u2019s lacking is just the Evanescent Lotus. It\u2019d be hard for you to bring the Evanescent Lotus to me before it withers, so you should bring this blue pill around with you instead. All you have to do is to swallow the blue pill and the Evanescent Lotus simultaneously, and you\u2019ll be able to release your seal.\u201dZu An carefully received the blue pill before looking at Ji Dengtu warily. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about medicine, but are you sure you aren\u2019t toying with me? Aren\u2019t you supposed to forge the ingredients together in a cauldron together for it to work properly? Will it really work if I just eat the two of them simultaneously?\u201d\u201cAre you casting doubt over my professionalism as a physician?\u201d Ji Dengtu glared at Zu An imposingly. \u201cWho do you think I am? Don\u2019t put me on the same level as those inept physicians out there! Medicinal herbs like the Evanescent Lotus shouldn\u2019t be refined. Trying to do so would only cause it to lose its medicinal properties for nothing!\u201dZu An was still a little skeptical about this all. \u201cIs it possible that the Evanescent Lotus is all it takes to release my seal, and your so-called Sealing Pill is just for show?\u201dJi Dengtu was deeply offended by Zu An\u2019s words. His hand swiped forward to snatch the blue pill back. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, give it back to me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just joking~\u201d Zu An quickly stowed the blue pill away in his robe before smiling back at Ji Dengtu.Ji Dengtu harrumphed impatiently. \u201cIf not for the booklet you have offered me earlier on, I wouldn\u2019t have even given you the pill! Speaking of which, do you have more of such stories? Why don\u2019t you give them to me as a sign of respect for your elders?\u201dYou old pervert, Zu An thought. Of course, he didn\u2019t allow his true thoughts to show on his face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish this story first, and I\u2019ll think of more later on?\u201dNaturally, he shouldn\u2019t give out everything in one shot. There could be occasions where he would require Ji Dengtu\u2019s help in the future, so it would be better to drop the bait slowly.Upon learning that Zu An had more of such stories in his arsenal, Ji Dengtu\u2019s face immediately blossomed into a smile. \u201cWonderful! Even though you might be inept in certain aspects, your weaknesses are made up by your talent in this field. I see a brilliant future ahead of you, lad!\u201dZu An\u2019s face darkened. Are you sure you aren\u2019t insulting me here?\u201cAh, I nearly forgot.\u201d Ji Dengtu suddenly recalled something. \u201cRather than worrying about whether you\u2019re able to find the Evanescent Lotus inside the Ursus Dungeon, I believe that what you should be worrying about is whether you can even enter the dungeon at all.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zu An was taken aback. \u201cBut I\u2019m a student of Brightmoon Academy though. There are still restrictions despite that?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Ji Dengtu stared at Zu An as if he was an idiot. \u201cEven though dungeons tend to be fraught with dangers, it\u2019s filled with fortuitous encounters, so it\u2019s a place where almost all cultivators look forward to. There are simply far too many people coveting a limited resource here, so naturally, some restrictions have to be put in place.\u201cA prefectural dungeon is usually controlled by the academy nearest to it, but as you say, a prefecture has many academies. These academies would usually send their students over prior to the opening of the dungeon, and out of fairness, they would hold a selection tournament to decide on the slots.\u201dZu An immediately raged upon hearing those words. \u201cAren\u2019t you making a fool of me here? A selection tournament? How can I possibly have the ability to win something like that?\u201dHe had managed to secretly raise his cultivation to the third rank thus far, but he was well aware that there was plenty of fifth rank and fourth rank cultivators in Brightmoon Academy. Furthermore, the students from the other academies in the prefecture would be participating in the selection tournament as well. Unless he were to reveal all of his trump cards, he stood no chance at all.However, it wasn\u2019t his way of life to reveal all of the trump cards he had. Doing so would only expose his means to his enemies.On top of that, Ji Dengtu wasn\u2019t aware that Zu An was able to cultivate. In other words, the other party had told him about the Evanescent Lotus knowing that it was hopeless for him.\u201cCalm down, calm down!\u201d said Ji Dengtu sheepishly. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not too possible for you, you do have a capable wife. Chu First Miss can be said to be one of the most outstanding cultivators amongst the younger generation. There\u2019s no doubt that she would be able to get into the dungeon. So, you can just get her to find the Evanescent Lotus for you.\u201dBlack streaks crossed Zu An\u2019s face. \u201cAs you said, the Evanescent Lotus is an incredible treasure which even a single petal could raise one\u2019s cultivation by a step. Even if she manages to find it, she would just eat it for herself.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you her husband? If her husband is ailing, it\u2019s her duty to help you. Does she really intend to live her life as an old maid?\u201dZu An glared at Ji Dengtu sharply. If he was strong enough, he might have just slit the latter\u2019s throat there and then. This bastard was really stabbing at all of his sore spots.\u201cBut again, it probably isn\u2019t a wise decision to count on your wife. Couples tend to split up in the face of adversary after all.\u201d Ji Dengtu suddenly changed his tune. \u201cHowever, you do have other means. Take for example, big-breasted Pei from Brightmoon Academy\u2026 Ah, I mean Pei Mianman, isn\u2019t she interested in you too? If you can\u2019t count on your wife, you should turn to your lover instead then. She\u2019ll surely be willing to help you.\u201dJi Xiaoxi had told Ji Dengtu about the events that had transpired in the academy, and to be honest, he was quite impressed with Zu An. \u201cI must say, you are quite a wild guy. Despite being inept down there, you were still able to win the affection of so many beauties. If you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you share your secret with me?\u201dZu An\u2019s veins began popping out of his temple. You just have to keep mocking me, huh? Just you wait! I\u2019ll remember this! Once I recover from my affliction, I\u2019ll make sure to dig up all of your old wounds and slather salt over them!Of course, he dared not to say these words right in front of him.Ji Dengtu realized that Zu An wasn\u2019t responding well to his teasing, so he gradually grew bored of it. \u201cOh right, I nearly forgot. The Chu clan invited me here to treat your injuries.\u201dAs he spoke, he began to inspect Zu An\u2019s body while clicking his tongue in wonderment. \u201cThere\u2019s really something weird about your body. Ordinary humans would have already died by now if they were to suffer such severe injuries, but you\u2019re still alive and kicking. On top of that, the speed of your natural recovery seems to be much faster than average too.\u201dZu An was a little surprised to hear that. This should be the effects of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, I guess. This is a skill that relies on getting hurt to grow stronger, so it\u2019s bound to have some effects relating to recovery too. Otherwise, practitioners of this skill would never live to the day they become strong.Ji Dengtu prescribed some medicine before leaving with an excited look on his face. He was in a rush to enjoy the little booklet he had just obtained.After Ji Dengtu\u2019s departure, Zu An fell into deep thoughts. How can I earn the right to enter the dungeon and find the Evanescent Lotus?A while later, his lips gradually curled into a smile\u2026\u2026The following morning, Zu An struggled up from his bed, insisting on heading to the academy. Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru were very pleased to see his proactive attitude toward learning, and for once, they felt that there was hope for him. However, they were still quite worried about Zu An\u2019s injuries, so they called the estate\u2019s physician over to take a look at him.Astonishingly, they found that Zu An had already mostly recovered from his injuries.\u201cHm. It looks like Ji Dengtu\u2019s reputation wasn\u2019t just hearsay.\u201d There was no way Chu Zhongtian could have imagined that this was the result of Zu An\u2019s cultivation technique, so he attributed the credit to Ji Dengtu.Qin Wanru chuckled softly and said, \u201cBut you weren\u2019t willing to let him enter the estate back then.\u201d\u201cThat fellow keeps eyeing you with a licentious gaze. How can I possibly allow him to enter the estate?\u201d Chu Zhongtian harrumphed coldly.\u201cAiyo~ Are you getting jealous over here?\u201d Qin Wanru gently nudged Chu Zhongtian as her cheeks burned up slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But again, given how Ji Dengtu was so desperate enough to resort to stealing women\u2019s dudou, he was probably a typical shut-in who was all bark and no bite.Anyway, since Zu An was fine, there was no reason for Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru to stop him from going to the academy anymore. That said, they still arranged for a couple of bodyguards to protect him.Needless to say, Zu An wasn\u2019t be like those nitwits in the movies, who desperately tried to escape from their bodyguards, only to fall into danger. Right now, he only wished that the Chu clan could assign even more guards to him. There was no saying that Snow or Mei Chaofeng might just pop out from a random alley and try to take his life.Different from the wary Zu An, Chu Huanzhao seemed to be in a cheerful mood. She was a happy-go-lucky person who rarely allowed anything to bother her for too long.\u201cBrother-in-law, brother-in-law! Hurry up and tell me how you managed to earn so much money from the Silverhook Casino the other day! I was dragged away by my mother before you were able to tell me anything!\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes were gleaming with curiosity.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the Chu clan strictly forbid gambling? Aren\u2019t you afraid of your mother punishing you for asking about such stuff?\u201d asked Zu An.\u201cI\u2019m just asking about it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to gamble. Besides, my mother doesn\u2019t care that much about me anyway!\u201d Chu Huanzhao grabbed Zu An\u2019s arm and began shaking it. \u201cBrother-in-law, just tell me, alright? Please~\u201dFeeling the soft sensation on his arm, Zu An\u2019s heart jolted. Why does this lass have no concept of distance between opposite genders? This won\u2019t do. I really need to educate her properly so that she doesn\u2019t get taken advantage of by some stinky brat in the future!To be frank, he was quite proud of what he had achieved in the casino last night, and it would be a waste to keep such a great story to himself. So, he heaved a helpless sigh, as if he was giving in to Chu Huanzhao\u2019s pleas, before finally recounting the exciting chain of events that had him crowned as the God of Gambling.Based on Ji Dengtu\u2019s reaction to the booklet he had prepared, he figured that even though the people of this world were strong, they had very little entertainment content here. It wasn\u2019t like his previous life, where dramas and movies were readily available for consumption.Zu An\u2019s riveting story gripped Chu Huanzhao\u2019s attention tightly from the start to the end. Even the guards of the Chu clan couldn\u2019t help but turn their gazes over, impressed with his storytelling ability.Even if he does get evicted from the Chu clan in the future, he\u2019ll still be able to make a living for himself by telling stories on the bridge.At the end of the exciting story, Chu Huanzhao exhaled deeply before remarking regretfully, \u201cIt\u2019s such a pity that I wasn\u2019t able to see it with my own eyes. Brother-in-law, if such exciting things happen again in the future, you must make sure to bring me with you, alright?\u201dZu An nodded in agreement. \u201cAlright, alright~\u201dEven though Chu Huanzhao was rather fierce to him at the start, she did treat him quite well afterward.\u201cLet\u2019s hook pinkies to seal the promise then!\u201d Still worried that Zu An would leave her behind, she stretched her finger forth.Her graceful fingers affirmed Zu An\u2019s belief that she was truly a beauty in the making. It was just a pity that she harbored the soul of a man. What a waste of a good face and body.\u201cAlright.\u201d Left with no choice, Zu An stretched his hand forth and hooked pinkies with her.\u201cThis seal of promise will last for a hundred years.\u201d Delighted, Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes curled into beautiful crescents.The guards of the Chu clan were astonished. Just what charm does this useless drafted son-in-law has? Not only did Chu First Miss choose him as her husband, but even the Chu Second Miss seems to be on close terms with him too!Should I find an opportunity to consult him on this? While it\u2019s impossible for us to aim for the young misses, there are still many beautiful maids in the estate.Only Cheng Shouping was standing limpidly behind. Snow, my beautiful Snow. Why must you be a spy? My sorrow is like the raging tides of the river. I fear that I\u2019ll spend a life devoid of love.It was then that a commotion sounded by the side.\u201cStep aside, step aside! The horse is running wild!\u201dThe crowd turned around, only to see a carriage barging its way through the streets forcefully. The coach was trying his best to stop the horse, but the horse had already run amok and couldn\u2019t be controlled.\u201cYoung master, be careful!\u201dThe guards of the Chu clan quickly stepped forward to protect Zu An and Chu Huanzhao in their middle. Cheng Shouping also quickly rushed over to hide behind the two of them.Just as the carriage was just about to collide with them, a guard suddenly flitted forth and grabbed the harness of the horse by the side. Then, the muscles on his arm began bulging as he forcefully pulled the two alarmed horses to a halt.Applause sounded from the surrounding crowd, who were impressed by the guard\u2019s valiance.\u201cAiya~\u201dAll of a sudden, a feminine cry sounded as a person tumbled out from the carriage. The abrupt halt of the carriage had caused the person sitting inside to lurch outward from inertia.Everything happened so fast that before the guards of the Chu clan could react, the person had already rammed right into Zu An.In a moment of daze, Zu An subconsciously reached out to catch the person. The sheer impact made him stagger a few steps backward. It was fortunate that Chu Huanzhao had reached out to support him then, thus sparing him from a fall to the ground.\u201cY-young master, thank you for your help.\u201d A slightly frightened voice sounded from his arms. The voice had a beautiful quality that was both crisp and gentle, almost like the melodious clink of pearls.Zu An lowered his head and saw a beautiful woman in his embrace. There was a tinge of redness on her fair cheeks, and her eyes were gleaming brightly. Her dress was embroidered with flowing water and fleeting clouds, and every thread used in her clothes were made out of top-quality material. It could be discerned from a single glance that she was from a rich family.Despite so, she didn\u2019t feel bourgeois. She emanated an air of traditional grace that evoked goodwill from others.By Zu An\u2019s side, Cheng Shouping finally caught a proper look at her appearance, and as if a bolt of lightning had struck him, he shuddered in utter shock. \u201cThis is bad, this is bad. How could there be such a beautiful woman in the world? I can\u2019t hold on anymore. I think I\u2019m already in love with her!\u201d\u201cZheng Dan, what the hell are you up to?\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed.Zheng Dan?The name was familiar to Zu An. Back then, when Wei Suo spoke about the Sweetheart Ranking of Brightmoon City to him, Zheng Dan was ranked in eighth place. Given that they attended the same academy, it was no wonder that Chu Huanzhao recognized her.To be honest, Zheng Dan was gorgeous. Looking at her from close-up, Zu An could see her fluttering eyebrows, enchanting eyes, and inviting red lips.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but wonder who was the man behind the Sweetheart Ranking. So far, every single one of the women he had seen on the Sweetheart Ranking were indeed ravishing beauties, worthy of their fame.\u201cHey, how long more are you going to continue holding onto her?\u201d Seeing how the two of them were still staring at one another lovingly, Chu Huanzhao immediately lost her patience.At her remark, Zu An finally snapped out of his daze and put the woman down. \u201cYoung miss, are you fine?\u201dShe really has a soft body. It\u2019s almost as if she has no bones at all.\u201cT-thanks for saving me.\u201d The woman quickly tidied up her slightly messy hair before responding to Zu An with a smile.Cheng Shouping suddenly felt incredibly regretful. He should have rushed forward earlier. Not only would he be able to express his loyalty toward the young master and Chu Second Miss, but at the same time, he would also get a babe in his embrace too.\u201cYou would have fallen to the ground if not for me supporting the two of you. Why aren\u2019t you thanking me?\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed snappishly.Zheng Dan bowed slightly to Chu Huanzhao and remarked with a smile, \u201cMy gratitude to Chu Second Miss too.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t hear any sincerity in your voice at all.\u201d Chu Huanzhao crossed her arms before turning her face sideward, not acknowledging Zheng Dan at all.Zheng Dan didn\u2019t lose her temper despite Chu Huanzhao\u2019s rudeness. Instead, she turned back to Zu An and said, \u201cOur horses got a scare earlier. It was fortunate that you caught onto me, or else the consequences would have been dire if I had fallen on the ground.\u201d\u201cAny man in my place would have surely offered his help. It would be a loss to all men in the world if such a beautiful face were to be scarred,\u201d replied Zu An with a smile.Zheng Dan chuckled softly to his compliment. \u201cYoung master, you\u2019re flattering me.\u201dChu Huanzhao couldn\u2019t stand watching this farce anymore. \u201cHey hey hey! Why are the two of you flirting right before me? Don\u2019t you think that this is too much?\u201dZheng Dan turned her head over to Chu Huanzhao in surprise as she asked, \u201cChu Second Miss, is he your lover? My apologies.\u201dChu Huanzhao\u2019s face immediately reddened. \u201cPui! He\u2019s my brother-in-law. Stop feigning ignorance! I don\u2019t believe that you don\u2019t know who he is!\u201dZheng Dan widened her eyes in astonishment and remarked, \u201cAh! So you\u2019re the husband chosen by Chu First Miss! I\u2019ve heard many things about you, and it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d\u201cRumors can\u2019t hold a candle to the person in flesh, right?\u201d Zu An couldn\u2019t resist asking.Zheng Dan shook her head and smiled softly. \u201cYoung master, you have a heroic heart. Indeed, the rumors don\u2019t do you justice.\u201dZu An\u2019s heart bloomed in happiness. He was aware that Zheng Dan was just being polite, but that didn\u2019t dampen the joy from being praised by such a beautiful woman.Ever since he arrived in this world, all he had been hearing was \u2018wastrel\u2019 and \u2018trash\u2019. It was rare that someone had such a high opinion of him, and it was even rarer than the person was such a great beauty.It looks like I have pretty good luck with women after all.\u201cI still have some matters to attend to, so I won\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201d Zheng Dan bowed slightly with a smile before taking her leave, leaving behind a faint fragrance in her wake.Chu Huanzhao noticed that Zu An and Cheng Shouping were still staring dazedly at Zheng Dan\u2019s departing figure, and she suddenly felt incredibly angry. \u201cWhat are you staring at? She\u2019s already gone!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +100 Rage!\u7956\u5b89\u5fcd\u4e0d\u4f4f\u8bf4\u9053\uff1a\u201c\u5c0f\u59e8\u5b50\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f60\u5c31\u8be5\u8ddf\u4eba\u5bb6\u5b66\u5b66\uff0c\u660e\u660e\u957f\u76f8\u548c\u5979\u4e0d\u76f8\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5bb6\u4e3e\u624b\u6295\u8db3\u4e4b\u95f4\u5c3d\u662f\u5973\u4eba\u5473\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u6d41\u8fde\u5fd8\u8fd4\u3002\u201dZu An couldn\u2019t resist remarking, \u201cSister-in-law, it\u2019s not that I want to nag at you, but you should learn a thing or two from her. Every gesture of hers exudes gentleness and femininity, leaving a lingering impression in the hearts of others.\u201dCheng Shouping also nodded vehemently in agreement.Chu Huanzhao nearly exploded on the spot. \u201cWhat did you just say? You want me to learn that disgusting tender act she puts on? It\u2019s already nauseating enough for me just to see it!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Chu Huanzhao for +348 Rage!Zu An frowned. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t insult her just because she has good looks and acts in a demure manner.\u201d\u201cOnly licentious men like you will be fooled by her appearance. Do you know that she\u2019s already engaged? Despite having a fianc\u00e9, she still got all touchy with you in public instead of trying to keep her distance. That should be more than enough to show what kind of person she is!\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed.\u201cShe\u2019s engaged?\u201dZu An suddenly felt a sense of loss inside. This was simply how men were like. Even though he harbored no feelings for Zheng Dan, he still hoped for all beauties in the world to revolve around him.Cheng Shouping was also horrified. My budding love\u2026 Is it going to come to an end once more just like that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Huanzhao felt invigorated to see the disappointed reactions of the two men. \u201cHer fianc\u00e9 is no other than Sang Qian, the man you met last night. Sang Qian\u2019s father is obviously coming after our Chu clan this time around, and the Zheng clan has quite a few business-related conflicts with us here at Brightmoon City. There\u2019s no way Zheng Dan doesn\u2019t have any ulterior motive in mind by trying to approach you. Only perverts like you would fall for her beauty trap!\u201dSang Qian\u2019s fianc\u00e9?\u201d Recalling the arrogant young general he met last night, Zu An fell into deep thought.\u2026The ornate carriage of the Zheng clan was parked by a remote alley. The panic on the coach\u2019s face had long vanished, replaced with composure. \u201cYoung miss, did you manage to obtain the debt note?\u201dZheng Dan shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on him. Looks like we\u2019ll have to try a bit harder.\u201dEarlier, when Zu An caught her, she snuck her hands into his pockets and searched through them. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t find anything at all.The coach harrumphed coldly. \u201cThat wastrel must have used up his lifetime worth of fortune to get a chance to touch our young miss\u2019 body with his unworthy hands!\u201dA faint smile surfaced on Zheng Dan\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It was through my clothes, and his hands didn\u2019t dare to wander about either. I didn\u2019t suffer any grievances.\u201dThe coach was relieved to hear those words. \u201cYoung miss, I\u2019ve been by your side since you were still young. I can\u2019t bear to see anyone taking advantage of you. Speaking of which, that Sang fellow sure is ridiculous. How in the world could a man possibly think of having his fianc\u00e9e lay a honey trap for another man?\u201dZheng Dan didn\u2019t think much of the matter. \u201cUncle Yue, calm down. In the first place, my engagement with Sang Hong is a political marriage, a relationship built on mutual profit. It\u2019s inevitable that we would have to lose something in order to gain something.The coach named Uncle Yue sighed deeply. \u201cYoung miss, you\u2019ve suffered for the Zheng clan.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for myself too,\u201d Zheng Dan replied with a smile. \u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t really let Zu An take advantage of me. Besides, the earlier encounter with him made this matter even more interesting.\u201d\u2026Over on Zu An\u2019s side, Chu Huanzhao continued to assault his ears through her rants, and the torture only finally came to an end when they arrived at the academy. Chu Huanzhao headed straight toward her classroom, but Zu An went for the administrative building, toward the office of the beautiful principal.He knocked on the door, and he soon Jiang Luofu\u2019s charismatic voice echoing back in response, \u201cYou may enter.\u201dZu An pushed the heavy door open and walked in. There were many interesting objects inside the office, but it was still Jiang Luofu herself who stood out the most.Under the rays of the morning sun, her skin looked fair like snow. Her eyes were deep and enchanting, her nose was sharp and lofty, and her bright red lips looked ever so inviting. She brought the contrasting ideas of imposingness and seductiveness together in perfect harmony.Looking at her long, lustrous hair, one would feel an uncontrollable urge to reach out and pull out the hairpin holding it all in place. Her cascading long hair would probably flow smoother than silk.It was only out of fear that Zu An dared not to make a move at all.\u201cWhat a coincidence, I was just about to look for you.\u201d Jiang Luofu was a little surprised by Zu An\u2019s visit. She gently waved her hand, and a light breeze blew across his face. Before he knew it, the heavy door behind him had already closed shut.\u201cPrincipal, you have something for me?\u201d Zu An wasn\u2019t so narcissistic as to think that Jiang Luofu had fallen for his good looks.\u201cYou\u2019re acquainted with Shang Liuyu?\u201d Jiang Luofu directed an enquiring look at Zu An as she fiddled with a hairpin that looked identical to the one holding her hair in place.\u201cShang Liuyu?\u201d Zu An shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201dHis mind quickly whirred into action. He wondered if it was possible that Ji Dengtu\u2019s request of having him to steal Shang Liuyu\u2019s dudou had been exposed. It shouldn\u2019t be though. I haven\u2019t even met her before!\u201cYou don\u2019t know third place Shang Liuyu of the Sweetheart Ranking?\u201d Jiang Luofu\u2019s eyes narrowed in skepticism.\u201cI mean, I have heard of her name, but I\u2019ve never met her in person.\u201dOddly enough, Zu An suddenly remembered about Wei Suo\u2019s excited fanboying over Jiang Luofu at this moment, such that his eyes subconsciously focused on the latter\u2019s legs.Hmm, it does look as smooth as jade. Oh, is it skin-colored stockings today? Wow, it looks good on her.Jiang Luofu swifty noticed his rude stares, and her eyebrows arched up in displeasure.Zu An jolted in fright, and he quickly added, \u201cI think that those are nothing more than empty rumors. How can that Shang-something possibly be more beautiful than you? With those legs you have, there\u2019s no way she can hold a candle to you!\u201dZu An\u2019s extremely earnest tone provoked a chuckle from Jiang Luofu. \u201cI\u2019ve heard plenty of pleasantries from others in the past, but you\u2019re the first one that to dive into such elaborate detail.\u201dSeeing that Jiang Luofu didn\u2019t get mad at him, Zu An straightened his back and added on, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s a sincere thought from the bottom of my heart!\u201d\u201cLiu Shangyu will be upset to hear your words,\u201d Jiang Luofu replied with a teasing smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s ungrateful of you to talk badly of her behind her back?\u201d\u201cUngrateful?\u201d Zu An was confused. I don\u2019t even know this person, so how could I possibly be ungrateful to her?Jiang Luofu took out a book from her drawer and began flipping through it. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you previously that you shouldn\u2019t reveal the fact that you possess transcendent class aptitude? You mentioned the aptitude test you had at the school entrance, so I went over to deal with the relevant records. However, it turns out that someone has already dealt with them before me. I looked into it a little, and it turns out to be Liu Shangyu.\u201dShe paused for a short moment to assess Zu An intently for a moment before asking once more, \u201cAre you certain that you aren\u2019t acquainted?\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 Could it be that my charisma has reached a level where I managed to make a woman fall head over heels for me unknowingly?\u201d Zu An lightly caressed his face as he remarked with astonishment.\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Luofu.Wow. This guy\u2019s skin must be as thick as city walls.\u201cForget it if you don\u2019t know her then.\u201d Jiang Luofu harrumphed softly. \u201cYou were looking for me?\u201dZu An walked over and naturally pulled over a stool to sit right opposite her. \u201cYes, I want to become an honorary teacher of the academy.\u201dAmused by what she had just heard, Jiang Luofu crossed her legs subconsciously. \u201cAre you insane, or am I out of my mind? Did you just say that you wish to be a teacher at our academy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Zu An nodded his head in response.Now that he was closer to Jiang Luofu, he was able to take a good look at her immense charm. Her ample breasts were followed by a slim waist, creating quite a visual impact. He felt like his nose would start bleeding at this rate.Jiang Luofu scoffed coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t you know what\u2019s the requirement to become a teacher in our academy? If you wish to teach cultivation-related topics, you need to be of the sixth rank or above. The requirement is lowered when it comes to literary subjects, but the staff we employed are all officials from the royal court who are skilled in their respective fields, be it laws, rites, or social affairs. May I ask if you\u2019re a sixth rank cultivator or an official of the royal court?\u201d\u201cOf course I know that, but I\u2019m not planning to go about it the proper way. I\u2019m hoping to see if it\u2019s possible for me to become an honorary teacher or something by sponsoring the academy,\u201d replied Zu An sheepishly.Most institutions in his previous life had such a \u2018hidden function\u2019. A tycoon sponsoring a school would be able to get a building named after him, and it would be easier for his children to get into the school as well. If the donor had a high standing in society, he might even be conferred the title of an honorary professor.\u201cSponsor?\u201d Jiang Luofu blinked her eyes in surprise. She had never heard of something like this before, but it did sound like something that could be feasibly maneuvered. However, she soon shook her head and said, \u201cTsk, you\u2019re just a drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan. How much money could you possibly have?\u201d\u201cIs 7,500,000 silver taels enough for you?\u201d replied Zu An.He had already come to a realization that the debt note was utterly useless in his hands. He didn\u2019t have the ability to cash out the money, and it was likely that it would only bring him more trouble in the future. More importantly, he would lose his greatest trump card, the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights!That was equivalent to losing a life!Money was good stuff, but survival came first.After careful contemplation, he decided to donate the money out, but where and how to donate the money were questions worth ruminating over as well. It was best if he could get tangible benefits out of it.\u201c7,500,000 silver taels?\u201d Jiang Luofu widened her eyes in shock. Even by her standards, this was still a humongous amount of money. \u201cWhere did you manage to get so much money?\u201dKnowing that Jiang Luofu was doubtful about whether he had the money or not, Zu An quickly shared the encounter he had at the Silverhook Casino with her.\u201cHow did you manage to do it?\u201d exclaimed Jiang Luofu.She had never been too bothered with the affairs in Brightmoon City, which was why she was only hearing about this major incident now.\u201cI was lucky, I\u2019d say,\u201d replied Zu An shyly.It wasn\u2019t technically a lie since he had used the Fortune Pill to boost his luck.\u201cForget it if you aren\u2019t willing to speak the truth. Well well well, you\u2019re really piquing my interest here.\u201d Jiang Luofu leaned forward a little to reassess Zu An once more. \u201cEveryone says that the First Miss of the Chu clan has married a useless husband, but why does it seem like there\u2019s more than meets the eye to this matter? You sure are hiding many secrets, be it your transcendent class aptitude, your cultivation; even a trip over to the Silverhook Casino easily scored you 7,500,000 silver taels from Mei Chaofeng!\u201dOn the other hand, Zu An cowered a little at Jiang Luofu\u2019s sudden approach. He was seeing a snowy ridge before him that was so enticing that he was afraid that he would inadvertently do something that would offend the beautiful principal.\u201cAttraction usually starts from interest.\u201d After careful contemplation, Zu An felt that he should still remind her. \u201cYour skin is peeking through your clothes.\u201dJiang Luofu lowered her eyes to look at her own clothes before the edge of her lips inched upward. \u201cYou\u2019re not like any other men. I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s you.\u201dZu An was taken aback. \u201cReally?\u201dDamn it, I should have taken a few more looks then! Could I actually be a lady killer? Otherwise, how could I have won goodwill from Jiang Luofu and the legendary Shang Liuyu so easily?\u201cOf course. You aren\u2019t a real man in my eyes; more like a fellow sister, I\u2019d say.\u201d Jiang Luofu waved her hand, paying it no heed at all.Zu An initially thought that she was just taking him to be a little brother or something, but being viewed as a \u2018fellow sister\u2019 was not a remark that he could tolerate. \u201cPrincipal, what do you mean by that?\u201dJiang Luofu chuckled softly upon seeing Zu An\u2019s livid face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell anyone about it.\u201dThe sympathetic gaze directed at his crotch was more than enough for Zu An to understand what was going on. At that instant, he felt an urge to bang his head against the wall and end his pitiful life right there.What the hell is going on? Why are more and more people finding out about it?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If that was really the case, he wouldn\u2019t even dare to face anyone anymore.The still chuckling Jiang Luofu shook her head and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I learned about it from another source. You don\u2019t have to worry about anyone seeing through you.\u201dZu An first heaved a sigh of relief before burning rage consumed him.It must be that darned Ji Dengtu! He must have revealed my condition while flirting with someone else. What the hell! Aren\u2019t doctors supposed to have a code of ethics that they\u2019re supposed to follow?\u201cCough cough, it looks like we have strayed off-topic.\u201d In order to clear away the awkwardness in the air, Zu An quickly changed the topic and brought the focus back to his purpose here. \u201cI don\u2019t expect any wages or tangible benefits from my honorary teacher title. Naturally, I won\u2019t be teaching any classes either. All I need is just an identity that\u2019s officially recognized.\u201dJiang Luofu gave the matter some thought, but she eventually shook her head. \u201cIf it had been a powerful cultivator with a good reputation who donated the 7,500,000 silver taels, I could have tried going for it. However, you should also be aware of how others view you. If I really bestow you with the title of an honorary teacher, I\u2019ll probably get flooded with spits the next moment. Brightmoon Academy would also become the laughingstock of the country. I can\u2019t afford to take on this risk.\u201dShe paused for a moment before adding with a helpless smile. \u201cWho told you to behave so unruly over the years? You only ended up hindering yourself.\u201dNaturally, there was no way Jiang Luofu knew that the original Zu An was real trash, so she assumed that he had just been slacking off.In truth, Zu An wasn\u2019t too surprised by this outcome. It was within his expectations that Jiang Luofu would turn down his request, and he was only using this as padding for the real intention he had in mind. \u201cIf I can\u2019t become an honorary teacher, I want you to give me a slot to participate in a dungeon then.\u201dIt was a huge loss to spend 7,500,000 silver taels for a slot to enter a dungeon, but if he were to factor in the fact that he was unlikely to be able to cash out the debt note and that it rendered the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights useless, the price was still something that he could barely accept.If he had chosen to participate in the selections with his own capabilities, while he did stand a fair chance if he used all of the means he had, he wasn\u2019t fully confident that he could emerge victorious. It would be all over if he were to encounter some monstrously talented prodigy from other academies or something.This matter concerned the welfare and happiness of \u2018little Zu An\u2019; he needed guarantees. In a sense, it was like insuring for the worst. On top of that, if this sum of money could buy him the goodwill of Brightmoon Academy\u2019s managerial team, it was still a fairly worthy deal. It had only been a few days since he had transmigrated over to this world, but it was already apparent to him that academies had an incredibly high standing in this world.Jiang Luofu\u2019s face darkened. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that the dungeons only open once every few years? There\u2019s high demand and the slots are limited; each academy would only send out the few most outstanding students to enter the dungeon. So, prodigies have to go through intense competition in order to earn their qualification. How could I just give a slot away that easily?\u201dZu An shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that you, as the principal of the academy, wouldn\u2019t have at least that much authority. It\u2019s 7,500,000 silver taels we\u2019re talking about here. Naturally, I can\u2019t be giving it away for free, right?\u201dJiang Luofu stared at Zu An with eyes so sharp that they seemed to be able to penetrate through any lies he would spout. \u201cWhat do you intend to do in the dungeon?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s to search for treasures and see if I\u2019m lucky enough to stumble on fortuitous encounters!\u201d replied Zu An.He didn\u2019t intend to talk about the Evanescent Lotus so as to not bring himself unintended trouble.Jiang Luofu nodded. \u201cI can see where you\u2019re coming from. Dungeons do hold many opportunities that entice cultivators. However, the slots to the dungeons are monitored by many eyes, and the Ministry of Rites is keeping a close eye on this too. I can\u2019t just give it away at a whim.\u201dZu An immediately lost his patience, but before he could say anything, Jiang Luofu raised her hand to stop him and carried on, \u201cCalm down and allow me to finish my piece first. While I can\u2019t give the slot to you directly, I can still pull some strings from the dark and assign you relatively weaker opponents. This way, you\u2019ll be able to obtain the qualification rightfully, and the academy would be able to relieve itself from pressure too.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that I\u2019ll have to fight for the slot then?\u201d Zu An was a little hesitant about this. As much as possible, he didn\u2019t want to reveal his trump cards to others. He preferred to be the one pulling the strings from the dark instead.Jiang Luofu straightened up her posture and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019ve been slacking off all of these years, but this is a world where the strong is respected. As long as you\u2019re able to prove your worth, you\u2019ll be able to receive high standing and ample cultivation resources. So, if you continue to lag behind the others, you\u2019ll only be overtaken by everyone else. The gap between you and the others will continue to increase, and you\u2019ll find it hard to catch up to them.\u201cI\u2019ll be honest; I don\u2019t really understand the rationale behind your thought process. You might have some considerations in the past, but you should know that you\u2019re a student of our academy now. You don\u2019t have to fear or cower before any enemies anymore. You can feel free to reveal your talents under our protection, and only then will I be justified to allocate more cultivation resources to you.\u201dZu An was moved by Jiang Luofu\u2019s words, He could sense that the latter really had his welfare in heart. However, the reasons involved in this matter were a little complicated. For one, he couldn\u2019t possibly tell her that the old Zu An was real trash, right?In the end, he could only change the topic with a random rebuttal, \u201cIf my enemy is the emperor, will you be able to protect me too?\u201dJiang Luofu was still feeling incredibly passionate after her rousing speech earlier when she heard Zu An\u2019s question and choked up. Her fair face immediately flushed red. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do anything about it then. But again, who do you think the emperor is? How could you possibly have the capability to offend him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m joking! Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll take your words to heart and do whatever that is needed. Alright, I think I should be heading off to class now,\u201d replied Zu An.Jiang Luofu wagged her finger. \u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201dZu An subconsciously leaned his head forward, wondering if she was asking him for a goodbye kiss. Is my charm really that great? Well, I guess it doesn\u2019t hurt me to give a small peck on such a beautiful face.Perhaps it was out of instinct, but Jiang Luofu suddenly reclined backward, creating some distance between the two of them. \u201cWhere\u2019s the 7,500,000 silver taels you promised?\u201dZu An finally realized what she was referring to. With a sheepish smile, he took off his shoes, pulled out the debt note, and placed it on the table.\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Luofu.With a face dripping with disdain, she picked up a brush and pried open the debt note with its tip. When she saw its content, a frown appeared on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s a debt note?\u201d\u201cWith the academy\u2019s influence and your wits, I believe that it won\u2019t be hard for you to squeeze the money out of the Plum Blossom Sect.\u201d Zu An laughed sheepishly.\u201cI was still wondering why you would be so magnanimous as to donate so much money to the academy\u2026 Forget it. I thought that I was taking advantage of you earlier, but this assuages my conscience. I\u2019ll help you deal with the matter concerning the slots. You should hurry to class now,\u201d replied Jiang Luofu.\u201cAlright! See you, gorgeous principal!\u201d Zu An waved his hand before sprinting off faster than a hare.Jiang Luofu\u2019s cherry lips curved into a slight smile as she murmured under her breath, \u201cWhat an interesting lad he is.\u201dHowever, when she turned her gaze back to the debt note that was freshly dug out from the fellow\u2019s shoes, her smile immediately froze in place. Maybe it was just her imagination, but she felt like she could smell an awful stench from it. She disdainfully stowed the debt note away before tossing the brush into the rubbish bin.Meanwhile, Zu An leisurely strutted his way to the classroom with a light heart that was finally relieved of the boulder weighing down on it. Admittedly though, he still felt that it was a waste to give away 7,500,000 silver taels just like that.Forget it, I\u2019ll just leave it in the gorgeous principal\u2019s hands for a few days as dowry. I\u2019ll bring her back home together with my money in the future!If anyone in the academy were to know of his thoughts, their lower jaws would surely fall slack from shock. There were plenty of men who were fond of Principal Jiang, but he was the only one who dared to harbor such thoughts.By the time Zu An returned to the classroom, he noticed that the class had already started. The teacher was a scrawny middle-aged man with oily hair. He had a center parting that made him stand out even amidst a crowd.Zu An discreetly snuck to his seat, but all of a sudden, there was a loud slam on the podium. \u201cWho allowed you to enter the classroom?\u201dThis loud slam jolted many snoring students awake. All of them quickly turned their eyes to Zu An.Zu An thought that it was a bit ludicrous how this fellow was lashing out on him so abruptly. \u201cYou were focused on the lesson earlier, and I didn\u2019t want to interrupt you. So, I chose to come in quietly.\u201d\u201cThe least you can do is to report your arrival after being late, and yet, you dare to strut in openly like nobody\u2019s business. This is a blatant show of disrespect for your elders!\u201d the teacher snorted.Zu An felt a little exasperated. This teacher was blowing up a small matter for no good reason. I don\u2019t even know him, so why is he so hostile against me?Most students in the class were also pleased to see Zu An getting scolded. Many of them had fallen in despair as they lamented how a man like him could win the fancy of so many beautiful women whereas they were still single, so they were more than happy to see him suffer.However, Zu An simply replied unhurriedly, \u201cI was late because Principal Jiang summoned me over to have a word. Teacher, if you don\u2019t believe me, you\u2019re free to ask Principal Jiang about it.\u201dThe middle-aged man choked up on Zu An\u2019s words. Is this fellow trying to one-up me by bringing the principal into this?You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +44 Rage!Zu An gasped upon seeing the name in the system. It finally made sense why the middle-aged man looked like this.Yang Wei felt that there was a need to proceed carefully here.Is this fellow really related to Principal Jiang? I\u2019ve never seen her getting so involved with a student\u2019s affair before. I thought that he\u2019s just a normal student and it would be more than easy to deal with him, so I agreed to help that fellow without hesitation. However, it seems like the matter is more complicated than I thought.But it\u2019s too late to change my mind now.\u201cWhy did Principal Jiang summon you?\u201d Yang Wei asked on, hoping to probe deeper into their relationship.Zu An shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s just asking me how\u2019s school and if I\u2019m adapting well to school life.\u201dThe frown on Yang Wei\u2019s forehead deepened. \u201cYou should return for your seat first.\u201dAfterward, he began the lesson, but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder just what the relationship between Zu An and Principal Jiang was. The Principal Jiang he knew of was not someone who would be so concerned with a student.But all of a sudden, he recalled that Principal Jiang had been alone all of these years. Other than the child that was in another class, she didn\u2019t seem to have any relatives or friends. How could she possibly be related to Zu An?Most likely, it\u2019s just the Brightmoon Duke asking her to take care of Zu An, so she\u2019s just doing her part in his account. Hmph! I nearly got duped by him!You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +58 Rage!Zu An was taken aback. What is wrong with this fellow? Is he really intent on going against me?He wondered if he had offended this fellow anywhere, but nothing came to mind at all. Could it be that my good looks have seduced far too many women, and a woman whom he\u2019s interested in is one of them?\u201cBoss, you\u2019re formidable!\u201d exclaimed Wei Suo.\u201cThere are plenty of things I\u2019m formidable in. Which one are you referring to?\u201d asked Zu An.Wei Suo shot up a thumbs up. Such extraordinary shamelessness\u2026 As expected of my boss! \u201cNeedless to say, I\u2019m referring to how you won 7,500,000 silver taels from the Silverhook Casino yesterday. The matter has already spread all around the city, and everyone is curious to know how you managed to do it!\u201dZu An laughed humbly. \u201cNaturally, it\u2019s due to my one-of-a-kind disposition!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWei Suo was taken aback. How am I supposed to carry on the conversation like this? So, he could only direct the conversation to another topic he was interested in. \u201cSpeaking of which, what color is Principal Jiang\u2019s stocking today?\u201dZu An thought about Jiang Luofu\u2019s long and shapely legs, and he subconsciously answered, \u201cSkin color~\u201dWei Suo gulped down a mouthful of saliva. \u201cAs expected of my goddess. Ahh, I\u2019m so jealous of you. You were able to meet her twice despite having just arrived a few days ago. I haven\u2019t even gotten a chance to meet her once thus far!\u201dZu An burst into laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re so obsessed with her even though you have never met her before?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Distance makes the heart grows fonder. From the moment I caught a glimpse of her on the street, I was already captured by the charms. My heart and body belong to her,\u201d said the lovestruck Wei Suo.Zu An shook his head in disdain. Heart and body, my ass. Like she would be interested in your body.\u201cSpeaking of which, who is this teacher who keeps putting on airs?\u201d Zu An took this opportunity to scout intelligence.As expected of a true gossip master, Wei Suo was able to immediately provide Zu An with an answer, \u201cHis name is Yang Wei, Brightmoon City\u2019s Civil Affairs Administrator. He\u2019s in charge of collecting agricultural taxes in the city. At the same time, he\u2019s also our arithmetic teacher too.\u201d\u201cOhhh, arithmetic teacher,\u201d murmured Zu An contemplatively.\u201cZu An, get up and stand at the back of the classroom!\u201d Yang Wei suddenly bellowed from the podium all of a sudden.His voice was like a sudden thunderous rumble, jolting awake many students who had just barely fallen asleep once more. They nearly peed their pants from the scare.What the hell are you up to? Can\u2019t a student get proper sleep now?Everyone turned to look at Zu An, curious to know just what kind of tyrannical deed had he done to make the teacher so angry. By this point, there were actually a few people who were already quite impressed with him. Ever since this fellow enrolled in the academy a few days ago, he had been barging into trouble after trouble.It had only been several minutes since the class started, but the teacher had already shouted at him twice.Zu An frowned. He knew that Yang Wei was hostile toward him, but he didn\u2019t expect the latter to act up so quickly.\u201cAre you deaf? Didn\u2019t you hear me telling you to stand at the back of the classroom?\u201d Yang Wei walked down from the podium to glare at Zu An with a darkened face.Zu An sneered coldly. You aren\u2019t even offering me any Rage points at all; it\u2019s obvious that your anger is feigned. So, he replied leisurely, \u201cIf I may ask, why are you punishing me?\u201d\u201cInstead of paying attention in class, you start chatting with your neighboring classmate instead. Tell me, should I not punish you for that?\u201d Yang Wei spoke with an air of haughtiness.This was the privilege of being of higher standing. If a teacher was determined to punish a student, he could easily find an excuse to do it, and no one could fault him on it. Besides, Zu An hadn\u2019t been listening to the lesson, which spared Yang Wei the trouble of having to think of an excuse to deal with him.Zu An\u2019s eyebrows shot up. One must know that the Yellow class was filled with the worst students in the academy. There was hardly anyone paying attention to class. Based on what he saw earlier, a third of them were sleeping and a third of them were chatting. There were even a couple of them secretly playing cards at the back of the classroom.Instead of dealing with those, he chooses to come after me instead\u2026Zu An didn\u2019t even turn to look at Wei Suo earlier so as to avoid giving Yang Wei a reason to flare up, but as it turned out, it didn\u2019t make a difference at all. Since the latter was determined to deal with him, he shouldn\u2019t blame him for retaliating accordingly then.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been listening intently all this while, and I haven\u2019t talked to anyone. Do you have any evidence to prove that I haven\u2019t been paying attention?\u201d asked Zu An.Yang Wei fell speechless at the rebuttal.He thought that it would be easy for him to deal with a mere student\u2014he just had to find a reason to punish him before blowing up the matter to have him expelled from school. As long as he lost the protection of the academy, those lords would be able to deal with him much easier.Yet, who could have thought that Zu An would actually talk back to him?Due to the significance of the academies in this world, there was a great focus on respecting the teachers. It was completely unprecedented in the history of the academy for a student to talk back to a teacher.However, this turn of affairs might be to his advantage instead. He was still struggling to find a legitimate excuse to have Zu An expelled. After all, he was just an ordinary teacher. It was still possible for him to dish out punishments to students, but having them expelled went beyond the scope of his authority.However, if Zu An were to disregard etiquette and openly challenge him, he could make use of this to drive him out of the academy.\u201cI saw you chatting away with the person seated next to you. Are you telling me that my eyes are playing tricks on me?\u201d Yang Wei harrumphed.In response, Zu An pointed out sharply, \u201cIf you saw the two of us chatting with one another, shouldn\u2019t you call out the two of us together? Why did you only point me out then? It can\u2019t be that a respected teacher is picking on one of his students, can it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what that student\u2019s name is, that\u2019s why I only called you out,\u201d Yang Wei hurriedly explained.Zu An burst out laughing. \u201cOh? That sure is weird. I don\u2019t recall introducing myself when I walked in earlier. I\u2019ve only enrolled in this academy a few days ago, and this is my first lesson with you. Yet, you actually knew who I am\u2026 I can\u2019t help but think that you\u2019re intentionally picking on me right now.\u201dThe other students in the eyes also began narrowing their eyes. None of them were fools. There was indeed something weird going on here.While none of them was fond of Zu An, their feeling of detest toward the teachers was far greater. This was especially so for scrawny middle-aged men who combed their hair into an awful center parting like Yang Wei.If teachers were really intentionally picking on students, wouldn\u2019t that mean that they could possibly be next?With all eyes suddenly centered on him, Yang Wei found himself feeling rather uncomfortable. He quickly clarified, \u201cWho in Brightmoon City hasn\u2019t heard of you, Zu An? You got into a conflict with a fifth rank senior, and you gambled in the Silverhook Casino and won 7,500,000 silver taels. How could I possibly be oblivious to who you are?\u201dI nearly fell into his trap! Yang Wei had long heard that Zu An had a sharp mouth, but he didn\u2019t think that the latter would actually be this formidable. He reminded himself to keep his guard up so that he wouldn\u2019t be done in like Mei Chaofeng.Zu An nodded lightly as he continued speaking, \u201cWell, even if you do know me, I wasn\u2019t talking earlier. As a teacher, you shouldn\u2019t slander your own students.\u201d\u201cRubbish! I saw you chatting with your neighboring classmate with my own eyes! Do you think that I, as a teacher, would wrong you?\u201d It was just a moment ago that Yang Wei was happy that he didn\u2019t have to pin a false accusation on Zu An, but who could have thought that the latter would start lying outright?\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. As they say, a huge jungle has all kinds of weird birds.\u201d As Yang Wei was already openly hostile to him, Zu An didn\u2019t think that there was a need to hold himself back. \u201cSince you said that I was chatting with my neighboring classmate, why don\u2019t you present some evidence then? Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to sue you for defamation!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +666 Rage!Yang Wei nearly fainted from anger. He had always been the one to point fingers at others and accuse them of false charges. This was the one time that he caught a person in the midst of wrongdoing, but ironically, he found himself unable to punish him!How the hell am I supposed to find evidence for this? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a recorder around!\u201cYou have evidence, right?\u201d However, Yang Wei was unwilling to give up just like this. He turned to Wei Suo and asked sternly, \u201cSpeak, did you talk to him earlier?\u201dWei Suo blinked his eyes innocently. \u201cTeacher, I didn\u2019t.\u201dZu An secretly shot Wei Suo a thumbs up. He was still thinking of reminding the latter not to give him away, but it seemed like he was a person who knew how to read the room. Young lad, you have potential!\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yang Wei was so angry that he found himself at a loss of words. The academy\u2019s culture is really getting worse. Each batch of students is worse than the previous!Fortunately, Yang Wei had come prepared. He wouldn\u2019t trip over something as minor as this. Hah, all you have is your mouth. I shall show you the absolute difference between us!Yang Wei took a deep breath to calm himself down before proceeding on, \u201cYou claim that you have been earnestly listening to my lesson earlier. In other words, you should be familiar with what I\u2019ve just taught you, right?\u201dMany students felt that Yang Wei was being unreasonable here. In the first place, arithmetic was not a simple subject. Even if a student was earnestly listening to the lesson, it was unlikely that he would fully understand what was being taught right away. By this point, it was already clear as day that Yang Wei was picking on Zu An.Some of the students felt spurred to speak up on Zu An\u2019s behalf\u2014they were still in the hot-blooded phase of their life, after all. However, to their horror, Zu An actually went along Yang Wei without any hesitation, \u201cIndeed. The content you are going through is too easy for me. There\u2019s no way I could possibly not know it.\u201dThis world had the additional mystical element of cultivation, but when it came to other fields of study, it was far lacking behind that of the modern world.Who do you think I am? I\u2019m a university student who has been through the torture of the National College Entrance Examination! Your arithmetic questions are a child\u2019s play to me!On the other hand, Yang Wei was delighted to hear Zu An\u2019s response. You could have chosen to back down, but your arrogance got ahead of yourself!\u201cThis is my first time seeing such an arrogant student! Very well, I\u2019ll come up with 20 questions. As long as you can answer any of them correctly\u2026 No, I mean three of them correctly, I\u2019ll believe that you weren\u2019t lying. How does that sound?\u201dHe was confident that Zu An wouldn\u2019t be able to answer even one of them correctly, but when he thought about the incident at Silverhook Casino, he felt that there was a need for him to be a little more conservative. Perhaps, Zu An might be able to get one right by some stroke of luck, but there was no way he could answer all three correctly!Watching as everything unfolded, Wei Suo couldn\u2019t help but feel deeply worried.Yang Wei\u2019s arithmetic class was known to be hard. When it came to other subjects, the students could still try to get by through memorization, but the same trick didn\u2019t apply to arithmetic. There was once Yang Wei set the questions a little harder than usual, and everyone ended up flunking the test. Given that Yang Wei was intentionally picking on Zu An this time around, he was bound to set the hardest questions. It was unlikely that anyone in the class would be able to answer any of them at all.Wei Suo was going to warn Zu An about it, but the latter had already accepted the challenge. \u201cSure, sound fine to me. However, what if I manage to answer all of the questions correctly?\u201d\u201cAnswer all of the questions correctly?\u201d Yang Wei burst into laughter, as if he had heard the most hilarious joke in the world. \u201cIf you can get all of them correctly, I\u2019ll resign from the academy and let you take over my position!\u201dZu An\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal then!\u201d\u201cDeal!\u201d Yang Wei sneered coldly, wondering if Zu An was out of his mind.Did you think that the questions I set would be easy? As a Civil Affairs Administrator handling taxes, I have been dealing with arithmetic for decades now! With my experience, I reckon that there no one in the entire prefecture who can surpass me in this field!That fool must have only seen the papers I have set in the past. Let me tell you this\u2026 I have actually been dumbing down the questions for the sake of the students! I shall go all out this time around and show you how terrifying arithmetic can be!\u201cWhat if you can\u2019t answer three questions correctly then?\u201d Yang Wei looked at Zu An provocatively.\u201cSince you\u2019re willing to put your career in the academy on the line, it\u2019s only fair that I do the same too. If I\u2019m unable to answer three questions correctly, I\u2019ll leave the academy on my own accord,\u201d replied Zu An.Yang Wei was overjoyed to hear that. You sure jumped straight right into my trap! Since that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t blame me then!Sensing the tense atmosphere between the two of them, the students of the Yellow class began getting fired up. Regardless of which world one was in, the crowd always loved commotion. Besides, there were hardly any students in the Yellow class who were interested in studying in the first place. To them, gambling was much more fun and productive.So, they began gathering closer to take a closer look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, thinking that he should prioritize dealing with Zu An here, he decided to bear with it. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, we shall have the students here bear witness to the process lest someone refuses to acknowledge the bet later on.\u201dHowever, Zu An raised his hand and said, \u201cWait a moment.\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you afraid now?\u201d Yang Wei asked with a frown. He was worried that Zu An would back down at this moment.\u201cAfraid?\u201d Zu An burst into laughter. \u201cNay, I just want to find a witness for our bet.\u201dYang Wei gestured to the students around him and asked, \u201cAre these people not enough for you?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Zu An replied matter-of-factly. \u201cIf you win, these witnesses would be enough for you. However, if I win, I\u2019m afraid that we won\u2019t have enough say to make you fulfill the end of your promise. After all, we\u2019re in a weaker position here.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that I\u2019d lose to you?\u201d Yang Wei snorted angrily.He might not have excelled as a cultivator, but he was still proud of his expertise when it came to arithmetic. He wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to question his ability in that field.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for certain in this world. If you aren\u2019t willing to do it, let\u2019s just call off the bet.\u201d Zu An shrugged before turning around to leave.Yang Wei thought that Zu An was really going to back down at the last moment, and he immediately panicked. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to lead his prey up to this point, and he was already on the verge of ensnaring him. There was no way he could allow Zu An to leave at this juncture.So, he replied, \u201cVery well then. Let\u2019s get another teacher to bear witness to this. However, I don\u2019t know who would be free at this timing.\u201dYang Wei was intending to bring some of the colleagues he was on closer terms with, but at that very moment, a refreshingly gentle voice sounded by the doorway. \u201cI shall be the witness of this bet.\u201dThe euphonic voice immediately caught the crowd\u2019s attention, and everyone swiftly turned their heads over to look at the doorway. In an instant, the previously bustling classroom fell silent.A woman was leaning lazily by the doorway. Her skin was fair and her lips were crimson. Her dress flowed along her body like silk, vaguely shaping out her beautiful profile. Even though she only revealed a small portion of her fair hands and legs through her dress, her appearance was more than enough to steal the breaths away from the men present.She had a carefree disposition that added an indescribable grace to her actions. Even just by casually leaning by the doorway, she still looked as beautiful as a goddess descending from the sky.Had it not been for the green wine gourd she was carrying on her waist, it was easy to think of her as an ethereal fairy untouched by the mortal world.\u201cT\u2026 Teacher Shang!\u201dAfter a brief moment of silence in the classroom, loud cheering broke out all around. The students all rushed forward to look at the woman with excited looks on their faces.Even Yang Wei\u2019s breathing hastened as well.In truth, he wasn\u2019t willing to teach at the academy at the start. Just his work at the Civil Affairs Department was enough for him to keep his hands busy. Had it not been for the rules of the royal court dictating him to serve as a teacher, he would have never bothered coming to an academy to teach a bunch of immature brats.However, the first time he held a lesson at the academy, he caught sight of this woman\u2019s visage, and all of a sudden, he felt that this work wasn\u2019t so tough anymore. In fact, he would find reasons to stay at the academy, all in hopes that he would be able to catch an additional glimpse of her.Meanwhile, Zu An was also surprised by this development too. To his astonishment, he had actually met this woman before. They spent time playing with a flute in the gazebo back then\u2026 Ah pui pui pui, I mean we bonded through music!He asked the woman for her name afterward, but the latter refused to tell him, saying that they would meet each other again if fate permits.Back then, he thought that she was just turning him down. How easy could it be for two strangers to meet one another once more in this massive world? However, now that he was looking at it once more, he felt that it was likely that the other party already knew that he was a student from Brightmoon Academy, and that they would surely meet one another again.It was not as if Zu An was a dense protagonist in a novel. With everyone around him addressing her as \u2018Teacher Shang\u2019, as well as those men acting as if they were animals in their mating season, he could figure as much that the woman was likely to be Shang Liuu, rank three on the Sweetheart Ranking.That would explain why the gorgeous principal had asked him if he was acquainted with Shang Liuyu, saying that the latter had helped him change the records. All of it was coming together now.Yang Wei\u2019s face immediately lit up as he put on what he thought to be his nicest smile as he said, \u201cTeacher Shang, what brought you here today?\u201dShang Liuyu smiled back and said, \u201cI just happened to be passing by. I heard some commotion, so I came in to take a look.\u201dHer smile was so potent that Yang Wei felt as if he could melt in it. However, when he recalled the situation he was in, his face immediately heated up. He quickly explained, \u201cSorry that you have to bump into something like this. This student simply too obstinate, so I\u2019m hoping to teach him how to respect his elders.\u201dShang Liuyu shot a glance at Zu An, and her lips inched upward. \u201cI happened to overhear that the two of you are intending to make a bet against one another. Why don\u2019t I be the witness for your bet?\u201d\u201cSounds good~\u201d\u201cTeacher Shang, you\u2019re the best~\u201d\u201cTeacher Shang, you\u2019re my idol!\u201dLoud cheers broke out in the classroom. From this, it could be seen just how popular Shang Liuyu was.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yang Wei was a little hesitant to accept Shang Liuyu\u2019s offer. It should have been easy enough for a teacher like him to deal with an unruly student, but if another teacher were to get involved too, there could be unexpected complications.\u201cAm I unwelcomed here?\u201d Shang Liuyu looked at Yang Wei quietly with her beautiful eyes.This was the first time Yang Wei was interacting with her in such proximity. Her impeccable face was like a critical strike right into his chest, leaving his breathing hastened. \u201cT-that\u2019s not what I mean! You\u2019re more than welcome here!\u201dYang Wei quickly convinced himself that it was no big deal. I don\u2019t have any chance to interact with Shang Liuyu usually, so this is a good chance to display my talent before her. I might be lacking in terms of cultivation, but there\u2019s no one in Brightmoon City who can hold a candle to me when it comes to arithmetic!There was usually hardly any ability to flaunt his arithmetic skills. After all, he couldn\u2019t possibly just walk up to Shang Liuyu and start reciting all sorts of mathematic equations\u2014she would just think that he was insane! It was unlikely that he would ever get another opportunity to like this flaunt his skills before her.\u201cTeacher Shang, this way please.\u201d Yang Wei guided her toward the podium fawningly.Zu An clicked his tongue at his subservience, thinking that he was exemplifying the very definition of simping.Shang Liuyu casually took a seat before smiling at the students. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s quieten down so as to not interrupt their match.\u201dHer words seemed to contain some sort of sorcery. The classroom that had been as noisy as a wet market a moment ago suddenly fell utterly silent. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by her impressive charisma.Yang Wei rolled up his sleeves as he felt motivation pumping through his veins. He was determined to prove his worth to his goddess. So, he used the knowledge he had accrued over the past few decades to craft out twenty highly difficult questions. He was confident that these students wouldn\u2019t be able to solve them\u2014even he would stumble on them if he got distracted for a moment!He could already imagine what was going to happen afterward. Zu An would nibble on his brush in frustration as he found himself utterly stupefied before the questions. Afterward, he would shamelessly claim that these questions were unsolvable. Then, before the respectful eyes of the students, he would slowly decipher every single question and awe everyone present.Maybe Shang Liuyu will look at me with glittering eyes too. This might just be the start of my love life!Just thinking about it was more than enough to make his cheeks quiver from laughter.No no no, I have to calm down. A lot of eyes are on me right now. I need to pay heed to my image!So, Yang Wei coughed softly before passing the test paper to Zu An. \u201cIt is not too late to back out now. If you can\u2019t even do a single question, you\u2019ll have to leave the academy.\u201dHe was only saying those words before Shang Liuyu to create the impression that he had no intention of cornering his student; it was his student who insisted on it himself. Of course, he was only saying those words because he knew that Zu An wouldn\u2019t be able to retreat easily even if he wanted to given the current heated atmosphere.In response, Zu An chuckled softly and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the one leaving the academy if I get everything right.\u201dPutting aside Yang Wei, even the other students in the classroom felt that Zu An had a screw loose. Only Shang Liuyu was watching the scene with an enigmatic smile on her lips, as if she knew something that the others didn\u2019t.\u201cIgnorant and arrogant!\u201d Yang Wei flew into a state of wrath. \u201cYou shall pay the price of being so self-assuming!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +541 Rage!He didn\u2019t take being insulted by his student before his goddess too well.On the other hand, Zu An shrugged leisurely as he took the test paper over.\u201cIs that all you got?\u201d Zu An burst into laughter.To be honest, he wasn\u2019t certain that he would be able to answer all of the questions. After all, he wasn\u2019t too sure how developed mathematics in this world was. However, when he saw the questions on the paper, he realized that he had been overestimating Yang Wei\u2019s ability.\u201cI advise you to focus your efforts on answering the question instead of running your mouth here. If you can\u2019t finish the paper before class comes to an end\u2026 Heh\u2026\u201d Yang Wei didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but his implied meaning was clear enough.Shang Liuyu couldn\u2019t help but interject in, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much time before the class comes to an end. Isn\u2019t this too rushed? Why don\u2019t we do this instead? Since I\u2019m taking the next class, I\u2019ll allocate half of the lesson to you so that you can take things slowly.\u201dYang Wei was taken aback by the proposal. However, he didn\u2019t think that Shang Liuyu was really helping Zu An here. In the first place, Shang Liuyu wasn\u2019t related to Zu An in any way, so there was no reason for her to look out for him.My goddess is probably just pitying Zu An and want to give him a chance. She must also be worried that others would accuse me of bullying the juniors, so she\u2019s doing this with my reputation in mind. How touching.Yang Wei was so moved that tears were about to seep out of his mouth. He quickly nodded his head and agreed to it, \u201cYes, what Teacher Shang makes perfect sense. Zu An, I\u2019ll give you another half a class to answer the questions then.\u201dArithmetic is a subject where either you get it or you don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t understand anything at all, I can give you all the time there is in the world, and it\u2019s still to no avail.Meanwhile, Zu An couldn\u2019t be bothered to respond to Yang Wei anymore, so he started reading the first question.\u20183 people drink 3 buckets of water in 3 days. How many buckets of water do 9 people drink in 9 days?\u2019Wei Suo\u2019s eyes lit up right away upon seeing the first question. \u201cThis is such an easy question! Even I can answer that! If 3 people drink 3 buckets of water in 3 days, it should go without saying that 9 people would drink 9 buckets of water in 9 days!\u201dThose words were met with widespread agreement by the students all around. Only a small minority felt that there was something wrong with the answer Wei Suo proposed, but they couldn\u2019t put their finger on what was wrong.Hearing that, Yang Wei sneered coldly. Do you think that I would come up with such an easy question? That being said, he didn\u2019t bother putting a halt to the discussions all around. He would love more than anything for these people to mislead Zu An.Meanwhile, Zu An shook his head in disappointment.Even elementary schoolers would be able to solve such a question easily. 3 people drink 3 buckets of water in 3 days, which meant that 3 of them drank a bucket of water each day. Multiplying it proportionately, 9 people should drink 3 buckets of water each day, and 27 buckets of water in 9 days!When Zu An wrote down the answer, Yang Wei\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. How could this be possible?The first time he saw this question on an ancient record, he ended up falling for its trick and answered it wrongly. Afterward, he posed this question to many of his colleagues, and most of them would instinctively answer \u2018nine buckets of water\u2019. How did this fellow solve it so easily?But again, this question wasn\u2019t too difficult. Yang Wei thought that Zu An might have just gotten lucky.Hmph, this is the easiest question of the lot! The difficulty will only rise with each passing question. I don\u2019t believe that you can remain so lucky!It was just that given that Zu An had managed to answer a question, it would probably be difficult to chase him out of the academy as he had envisioned anymore. Eyy, if only I knew that this would happen, I shouldn\u2019t have set the bet so low.You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +9 +9 +9\u2026Seeing the inflow of Rage points, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but think that Yang Wei sure reflected his name well. Even his Rage points dribbled in instead of flowing in a steady stream.He moved to look at the second question.\u2018A farmer\u2019s wife is washing bowls by the river. Passers-by ask her why she has so many bowls to wash, and she answered that her house had just hosted a lot of guests. Every 2 people would share a bowl of rice, every three people would share a bowl of soup, and every four people would share a bowl of side dishes. All in all, there are 65 dishes. So, how many guests has she hosted in her house?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne of the students immediately exclaimed in horror, \u201cIsn\u2019t that family too stingy? Two people have to share a bowl of rice? How in the world do they eat like that?\u201dYang Wei\u2019s face darkened. \u201cWhy are you picking faults with the question? We\u2019re here to answer the question, not to gossip about whether the family is stingy or not.\u201dZu An chuckled softly under his breath. He couldn\u2019t understand why Yang Wei would think such a simple question was actually difficult. Or could it be that people in this world didn\u2019t understand the concept of algebra?Zu An did a rough calculation before writing down \u201860\u2019.Gulp~Yang Wei swallowed a mouthful of his saliva in shock. How could this be? Did the fellow see the answer key beforehand? No, that\u2019s impossible. I came up with these questions on the spot! Are these questions actually easy?He started to doubt his sanity till he finally saw the confused looks on the faces of the students all around. Nay, how can that be? That fellow must have guessed the question, and he happened to get \u201860\u2019 on his first try. Yup, it must definitely be the case.Zu An moved on to the third question.\u2018In Brightmoon City\u2019s market, a rooster is worth 5 qian, a chicken is worth 3 qian, and three chicks are worth 1 qian. The farmer used a total of 100 qian to buy 100 animals. So, how many roosters, chicken, and chicks did she buy in total?\u2019Hm? This question looks pretty interesting. There are three unknown variables but we can only formulate two equations here. However, since the number is pretty small, we can just do a guess and check.Of course, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to exhaustively guess all of the possibilities to figure out the answer. There\u2019s a trick to it. Taking the number of roosters, chickens, and chicks to be x, y, and z respectively, we can simplify the equation to y = (100 -7x)/4.Given that the number of roosters, chickens, and chicks have to whole numbers, the equation (100 - 7x) must be a number that is divisible by 4, which means that x has to be an even number.From there on, we can quickly deduce that there are 4 roosters, 18 chickens, and 78 chicks in total!When Yang Wei saw Zu An writing the answer out, he felt his mind blanking out for an instant. Three questions! He has already managed to answer three questions correctly!He couldn\u2019t pull his weight and insist that Zu An\u2019s answer was wrong because there was a huge crowd watching right now. These students might not be able to solve the questions properly, but it was still easy enough for them to verify the correctness of the answer by working backward. Not to mention, Shang Liuyu was watching him too!How in the world is the fellow doing this? Isn\u2019t he supposed to be trash? How is he able to answer all of these questions so easily? On top of that, the speed at which he\u2019s solving these problems is unbelievable!Given that Zu An had already answered three questions correctly, he had already lost the bet. He couldn\u2019t chase the other party out of the academy anymore. Instead, he had to pray that the other party wouldn\u2019t be able to solve all of the questions, or else he would be put in a spot.He had never thought that such a situation would occur, so he agreed to the bet without any hesitation. Zu An\u2019s high proficiency in arithmetic was unexpected, and it left him panicking inside.No, there\u2019s nothing to fear. The questions are getting progressively harder, especially for the last one. I found it in an ancient record. Putting aside the students, even he couldn\u2019t solve the question himself!No matter how incredible this fellow is, there must be a limit to his capability. There\u2019s no way he can solve such an ancient difficult question too!To his dismay, Zu An\u2019s brush moved swiftly as he solved the questions one after another, inducing shocked exclamations from the surrounding students. Initially, everyone thought that he had just lucked off and somehow managed to guess the right answer. However, the fact that he was able to solve question after question correctly with hardly any downtime proved that he was a true arithmetic prodigy.Many of them were hoping to see Zu An make a fool out of himself. After all, he had married Chu Chuyan, the most beautiful woman in their academy, and flirted with many of those in the Sweetheart Ranking. They couldn\u2019t accept how he had a harem when the rest of them were still single. If they could chase him out of the academy, they would definitely do so without a sliver of hesitation.But surprisingly, as the bet went on, the crowd wasn\u2019t disappointed to see Zu An answering the questions one after another. Instead, they were starting to tremble in excitement. After all, the one thing that was more interesting than seeing a fellow classmate being expelled was seeing their own teacher being expelled!A faint trace of a smile also crept onto Shang Liuyu\u2019s lips too. Her eyes were focused on Zu An as she thought that he looked quite suave when he was focused on a task on hand.She couldn\u2019t help but remember their first meeting in the gazebo, and this further spurred her curiosity about him. Just how many secrets is this fellow hiding?In contrast to Shang Liuyu\u2019s relaxed demeanor, Yang Wei was frequently dabbing his forehead with his handkerchief to wipe off his cold sweat. He could sense the eyes of the crowd silently lingering on him, and it left goosebumps rising all over his body. Calm down, calm down\u2026 Yes, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be able to solve the last question!Finally, Zu An reached the last question.\u2018Two farmer\u2019s wives brought a total of 100 chicken eggs to Brightmoon City\u2019s market to sell, and the two of them earned the same amount of money after selling out their goods. The first farmer\u2019s wife told the second farmer\u2019s wife, \u201cIf I had as many chicken eggs as you, I would be able to earn 15 silver qian.\u201d The second farmer\u2019s wife then replied, \u201cIf I had as many chicken eggs as you, I would only be able to earn 6 and two-third qian.\u201d How many chicken eggs do each of them have?\u201dThe students began discussing the question fervently amongst themselves.\u201cThis is weird. They\u2019re both selling chicken eggs, right? Why are their prices different then?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that perfectly normal? It\u2019s obvious that one of the farmer\u2019s wife is better-looking than the other. People will naturally buy from the farmer\u2019s wife that looks better even if it\u2019s more expensive, and the uglier looking one has no choice but to lower her price to bring in customers.\u201d\u201cWhat wise words!\u201d\u2026Zu An was stunned to see this question. He turned to Yang Wei and asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t be thinking that this question is actually hard, right?\u201dYang Wei was bubbling with frustration. Of course! Why else would I leave it for the last? However, at this point, he dared not to underestimate Zu An anymore. So, he chose to respond with a vague answer, \u201cThose who are able to solve it naturally see no difficulty in it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed not hard,\u201d replied Zu An.This was basically just a problem involving simultaneous equations with four variables. Its calculation was tedious, but it was, by no means, difficult.Yang Wei was pissed off by Zu An\u2019s answer. I was just being courteous with you, but you sure are climbing over my head, huh? Why don\u2019t you try solving it and show me the correct answer then!You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +222 Rage!Zu An shot a perplexed glance at Yang Wei. He quickly wrote down a series of working on another sheet of paper before finally jotting down the answer: The first farmer\u2019s wife has 40 eggs and the second farmer\u2019s wife has 60 eggs.Many of the students had been diligently checking Zu An\u2019s answer for him, and soon, one of them exclaimed excitedly, \u201cHe got it right! He managed to get all 20 questions right!\u201dThe crowd was astonished. Many eyes began to dart toward Yang Wei as the bet they had made earlier was still fresh in their mind. Given that Zu An had successfully answered 20 questions, it was time for him to resign from his job at Brightmoon Academy.On the other hand, Yang Wei seemed to hear a ringing in his ears. Everything that had just happened defied his common sense. He thought that he had just received a sweet and easy mission to trample upon an incompetent student, but who could have thought that he would end up having the tables turned on him?This isn\u2019t right! Isn\u2019t he supposed to be a renowned wastrel in the city? How can he possibly be so skilled at arithmetic?Zu An turned to look at the ravishing Shang Liuyu, and he asked with a smile, \u201cTeacher Shang, right? Since you\u2019re our witness here, I\u2019d like you to declare the winner of the bet.\u201d\u201cNeedless to say, you\u2019ve won.\u201d Shang Liuyu nodded in response as she directed a knowing smile at him.With everything decided, Zu An turned to Yang Wei and said, \u201cTeacher Yang, right? I recall someone mentioning that he would resign from the academy if I manage to answer all 20 questions correctly. May I know if your words still hold true?\u201dYang Wei\u2019s face swiftly flushed bright red. He pointed his finger at Zu An in agitation as he bellowed, \u201cYou cheated! That\u2019s right, you must have cheated!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even care about embarrassing himself before his goddess anymore. What was more important right now was for him to keep his job, or else he would become the first teacher in the entire Great Zhou Dynasty to be forced to resign under the pressure of his student. He would never be able to raise his head again if he were to be humiliated like this!\u201cTsk!\u201dDisgruntled snorts echoed in the classroom. The students were all rather dissatisfied to see that he was intending to renege on his promise.Shang Liuyu also frowned as well. \u201cTeacher Yang, all of us can bear witness to the procedure. How could he have possibly cheated?\u201dYang Wei felt as if Shang Liuyu was looking at him with eyes field with contempt, and it made him even more agitated. He hurriedly replied, \u201cI remember it now! These questions can actually be easily guessed as long as you\u2019re lucky. The numbers aren\u2019t that big anyway. He could have just tried each answer one by one. Look at his workings! Does any of you understand anything at all? He\u2019s obviously guessing his way through!\u201dSome of the students took a careful look at Zu An\u2019s working, and they found themselves agreeing with Yang Wei\u2019s words. They are really illegible\u2026 If he really guessed all of them isn\u2019t his luck way too good? But again, he did win 7,500,000 silver taels from the casino just yesterday, so he probably has no lack of luck.Zu An sighed deeply. \u201cI\u2019ve long heard that you\u2019re a shameless person, but you manage to exceed my wildest imagination. You sure have no qualms spouting nonsense before your own students. Why don\u2019t you just tell us whether my answers are right or not?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of getting the answers right? If your working isn\u2019t right, it\u2019s all just flukes and deserves to be given a zero!\u201d Yang Wei forcefully pushed his logic forth. \u201cThis is simply the common rule of arithmetic classes. The purpose of the rule is to deal with those who copy answers and people who luck out like you!\u201dShang Liuyu chuckled softly before remarking, \u201cTeacher Yang, I think that your words don\u2019t make much sense here. Even if he\u2019s lucky enough to guess an answer or two correctly, he can\u2019t possibly be that lucky to get all twenty questions correct. Could it be that he\u2019s using a method that\u2019s so novel that no one has seen it before?\u201dHer good looks and her refined disposition allowed her to convince others easily even if she didn\u2019t aggressively push her point of view.\u201cTeacher Shang is right!\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for there to be such a huge coincidence in the world.\u201d\u2026Yang Wei\u2019s eyebrows twitched in anger. Is this woman intentionally trying to go against me? With both his job and honor on the line, he couldn\u2019t care that much anymore.With a darkened face, he began putting down Shang Liuyu, \u201cTeacher Shang, you\u2019re a foreign language teacher, so I don\u2019t blame you for not knowing arithmetic. The methods he has jotted down are absolutely nonsensical such that even the arithmetic teachers of the Royal Academy in the capital wouldn\u2019t understand them. There are no such methods in the world, so the only possibility is that he managed to get everything correct by chance. Otherwise, why don\u2019t you get him to explain the steps behind how he got the answer then?\u201dHe had already decided that no matter whether Zu An\u2019s explanation made sense or not, he would simply shrug them off as nonsense. This had already escalated into a fight with his reputation on the line, so he couldn\u2019t care about his appearance anymore.Shang Liuyu was put in a spot. Yang Wei was a renowned arithmetic expert in Brightmoon City, making him quite an authoritative figure on the subject. She wasn\u2019t in a good position to comment on this matter.With no way to help, she turned her gaze toward Zu An. To be honest, she was quite curious to see how he intended to deal with this situation. He always had a knack for resolving problems through unusual means.Zu An calmly replied, \u201cWith your poor aptitude in arithmetic, even if I do try to explain the methods to you, I doubt that you\u2019ll understand it.\u201dYang Wei was so angry that he began laughing instead. \u201cHahaha! Do you hear what that arrogant man is saying? I\u2019ve never heard such an insolent student before. I\u2019ll report this to the academy and have it expel you under the grounds of disrespecting your teacher!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +521 Rage!----Tael and qian are units of weight measurement used in Ancient China, with 1 tael (~37.7g) roughly being equal to 10 qian (~3.7g). However, qian is more frequently used in reference to coins whereas tael is used in reference to the larger ingots.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLooking at the infuriated Yang Wei, Zu An laughed softly and said, \u201cActually, there\u2019s a very easy method to resolve this situation. I\u2019ll just set twenty questions too, and regardless of whether you cheat or guess your way through, as long as you can solve them all\u2026 Forget it, I\u2019ll give you a discount. If you could even solve half of them, I\u2019ll immediately pack up my stuff and get out of the academy. Otherwise, I expect you to hold to the end of your bet. How does that sound?\u201dNo matter what, Yang Wei was still an official of the royal court and a teacher officially hired by the academy. Neither Zu An himself nor the academy was in a good position to expel him over a mere bet. However, what if Yang Wei couldn\u2019t even answer a single question he had set? No matter how shameless he was, there was no way he would have the face to continue staying here.Yang Wei was taken aback by the sudden proposal. Just thinking about how Zu An managed to easily solve all twenty questions was enough to intimidate him. His confidence was deflating.Shang Liuyu made use of this opportunity to chirp in, \u201cTeacher Yang, surely you can\u2019t be intimidated by your student, right?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Yang Wei immediately straightened his posture. \u201cDo your worst then! I\u2019ll solve even 200 questions if that\u2019s what it needs to make you submit!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a bad bet. He might not be able to solve all twenty questions, but at the very least, he felt that he should at least be able to answer ten of them. He was a renowned arithmetic expert in Brightmoon City after all, having calculated years of taxes for the Civil Affairs Department now. There was no way a kid\u2019s questions could possibly stumble him. As long as he succeeded, he would be able to send Zu An packing from the academy!Zu An could somewhat guess what Yang Wei was thinking from his reaction, and he smiled to himself. I shall show you the horrors of mathematics then!There were many plausible questions he could come up with, but he decided not to use the less mainstream geometry questions. There was probably no one in the world who knew about pi, radius of a circle, and that sort of thing, and others would only think that he was intentionally making things difficult for Yang Wei.In order to crush Yang Wei thoroughly, what he had to do was to come up with questions that everyone understood but was unable to solve. Got it!Moving his brush swiftly, it didn\u2019t take long for Zu An to write down twenty questions. Then, with an honest smile, he passed the paper over and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re a renowned arithmetic expert, I trust that these questions wouldn\u2019t pose any problem to you.\u201dYang Wei was surprised by Zu An\u2019s sudden humility. He unnaturally harrumphed a little before saying, \u201cOf course. How difficult could questions coming from a junior like you be?\u201dSo, he took the paper and read the first question:\u2018Two numbers from 1 to 20. The result of the addition of the two numbers is given to Person 1, and the multiplication of the two numbers is given to Person 2. Person 1 said that he didn\u2019t know what the two numbers are, and Person 2 said that he didn\u2019t know either. However, it was then that Person 1 said that he knew the answer now, and Person 2 swiftly remarked that he knew the answer too.\u2018So, what are the two numbers?\u2019Based on the questions Yang Wei had come up with, the concept of multiplication did exist in this world, so it wasn\u2019t out of the syllabus.Yang Wei blinked his eyes several times after seeing the question. What the hell is this? I\u2019ve never seen such questions before! T-this\u2026 How the hell do I solve such a question?!The question looked simple enough to him at first glance, but when he tried to solve it, cold sweat began dripping from his face. He realized that despite the knowledge he had accrued throughout his entire life, he was actually unable to figure out a way to solve this question!Putting him aside, the surrounding students also began discussing the question. It was their first time seeing such a novel question before. However, even after racking their brains for a long while, they still had no idea how to embark on it.\u201cSilence!\u201dYang Wei thought that he could get some inspiration from the students around, but most of their utterances were nonsensical, hardly contributing anything at all. This made him incredibly frustrated.In response, the students stuck out their tongues at him. You\u2019re the one who can\u2019t solve the question. Why are you venting your frustrations on us?Yang Wei\u2019s face turned as black as charcoal upon hearing their mutterings. But all of a sudden, he realized that there were only twenty numbers in total. At most, I\u2019ll just try the numbers one by one. I reckon that\u2019s how that fellow solved my questions earlier!With such thoughts in mind, he quickly composed himself before proceeding on with his calculations.The students looked at his workings on the paper, and they couldn\u2019t help but feel deeply impressed. As expected of the teacher. He managed to find a way to work out the answer in just a few moments.Meanwhile, Zu An sat on a chair with his legs crossed as he sipped on a cup of tea which Wei Suo brought out from god knows where. His eyes were directed on Shang Liuyu, appreciating her marvelous figure. Despite having met quite a few beauties after coming to this world, he had to admit that her charm was the real deal.Shang Liuyu, on the other hand, was focused on the question. Even though she was a foreign language teacher, she still knew a thing or two about arithmetic. She was able to solve most of the questions that Yang Wei came up with earlier, but the question Zu An devised was simply too bizarre. No matter how she thought it through, she had no idea how to solve the question.So, she subconsciously shot a glance toward Zu An, only to notice that the latter was staring at him. Amused by how his attention was wandering despite being in the midst of an important bet, she thought, \u2018This lad sure is confident in himself. He really is different from the others.\u2019In contrast to Zu An\u2019s relaxed demeanor, Yang Wei\u2019s clothes were already completely drenched in sweat by now. Initially, he was still making some progress with the guess and check method, but he was getting more and more muddled up as he progressed. Somehow, every answer he arrived at didn\u2019t seem right to him.He gulped down his saliva as he shot a look at Zu An, only to see that the latter was staring back at him with an enigmatic smile on his lips. All of a sudden, it struck him. This fellow must have intentionally put the hardest question in front to trap me! I nearly fell for his ploy!Yang Wei decided to proceed on with the next question before returning to this later on.He flipped over to the second question, and this was what he saw.\u2018There are three doors in front of you, but only one of them contains a treasure. The other two are empty. After you selected a door, someone helped you open one of the two remaining doors and revealed that it was empty. Then, the person offered you the chance to switch to another door. With the goal of maximizing the probability of choosing the door with the treasure, would you switch to another door? Please state the reason behind your decision.Yang Wei was delighted.That fellow has indeed put the hardest question in front. This is much easier! Hmph! Isn\u2019t the probability the same regardless of whether I change doors or not? He even tried to mislead me by phrasing it as if there\u2019s a better decision here. Do you take me for a fool?He quickly wrote down \u2018I won\u2019t switch to another door\u2019. However, still worried that his answer might be too ambiguous, he jotted down \u2018Regardless of whether I switch doors or not, the probability of selecting the door with the treasure is the same\u2019.Satisfied with his answer, he moved on to the third question.\u2018Five pirates managed to obtain 100 ki stones in a raid. Bandit A was given the right to decide the distribution, but the proposal he comes up with must be agreed upon by more than half of the pirates in order for it to be executed. Otherwise, he would be thrown into the sea, and Bandit B will be given the right to determine the distribution with the same rules applied. Assuming that you\u2019re Bandit A, how should you distribute the ki stones in order to maximize your gain?\u2018Please assume that the pirates are rational arithmetic experts, and they\u2019re able to accurately calculate their gains and losses to decide on the best course of action that maximizes their gains.\u2019Yang Wei was stunned. Just what in the world is in that fellow\u2019s mind to come up with such weird questions?His first response was to equally distribute the 100 ki stones amongst all of the pirates, but he soon threw out the answer and tried to calculate other possibilities.The students also began discussing fervently with one another what the answer should be, but none of them had a clue what the optimal distribution for Bandit A was.Meanwhile, Liu Shangyu found the use of the term \u2018pirates\u2019 in the question rather endearing. This lad sure comes up with interesting questions.A while later, Yang Wei took out his already soaked handkerchief once more to wipe his sweat. He was already in a full-blown panic mood by now. He realized that he couldn\u2019t verify whether his answer was right or not.Should I move on to the next question?Yang Wei remembered how Zu An had chosen to put the hardest question in front, and he figured that the questions behind should be easier. So, he took in a deep breath and proceeded on to look at the fourth question.\u2018Five prisoners, numbered from 1 to 5, will be taking out green beans from a rucksack filled with 100 green beans in turn. The rules state that they\u2019ll have to take at least one green bean, and that the prisoners who take the most and the least green beans will be sentenced to death. The prisoners aren\u2019t allowed to communicate with one another, but they are able to count the number of beans left in the rucksack through touch. Which of the five prisoners has the highest chance of survival?\u2018Note:1) All of the prisoners are smart, rational people who will decide on the best course of action for them.2) Their primary aim is to survive, followed by killing as many people as possible.3) There\u2019s no need to fully distribute all 100 green beans amongst themselves.4) If there are more than one prisoner who took the most or the least green beans, they would both be sentenced to death.\u2019Yang Wei nearly burst out cursing on the spot. What is this dumb question? Why are there so many rules here? The question looked simple at first glance, but if one were to start thinking about the specifics, there were so many factors to consider that it could blow one\u2019s mind.He spent a while attempting to work out a solution before eventually giving up and moving on to the next question.\u2018There are 100 people on an island. 5 of them have red eyes and 95 of them have blue eyes. This island has three weird rules:\u20181) They aren\u2019t to look into the mirror or any water surfaces, such that it\u2019s impossible for them to see their own eye colors2) They can\u2019t tell others what their eye colors are3) Once a person realizes that he has red eyes, he would have to commit suicide that very night\u2018One day, an adventurer arrived on the island. Oblivious to the rules, while he was partying with everyone else on the island, he accidentally let it slip that \u201cSome of you have red eyes\u201d.\u2018Assuming that everyone on the island is smart and capable of logical deduction, what do you think will happen on the island afterward?\u2019Yang Wei\u2019s eyes lit up. This question was much easier than the ones before. He grabbed his brush right away and began jotting down his answer.\u2026\u2026\u2026Just like that, with bouts of smiles and bouts of stress, he went through the questions one by one. Eventually, he realized that he was only able to solve a few of them.By this point, a huge crowd had already formed outside the classroom. Classes had already ended, but to everyone\u2019s astonishment, none of the students from the most mischievous Yellow class had left yet. Out of curiosity, the students from the other classes decided to head over to take a look, and it didn\u2019t take long for the bet between Zu An and Yang Wei to spread around the entire academy, drawing in massive crowds.If it was only a simple duel between Zu An and Yang Wei, the proud prodigies of the Sky class probably wouldn\u2019t bother checking things out. However, things were different if Shang Liuyu was here.Shang Liuyu was the most popular teacher in Brightmoon Academy. Her classes were always packed to the brim, and her students were always incredibly focused. Their eyes were simply too busy appreciating her beauty to possibly be distracted by anything else.Some of the students were here to watch the drama, but the majority were here to look at Shang Liuyu. However, it didn't take them long to be drawn to Zu An\u2019s questions.What was interesting about Zu An\u2019s questions was that they were very easily understood. Most people felt that they were doable, such that they couldn\u2019t help but start discussing the solutions and answers with one another. Even the prodigies of the Sky class, who were usually interested only in cultivation, began making calculations too.\u201cBrother-in-law, you\u2019re the best!\u201dNeedless to say, Chu Huanzhao wasn\u2019t one to miss a commotion, and she seemed oddly proud about the situation. It was almost as if she was the one in the limelight right now. She didn\u2019t think too much into her feelings; she thought that it was a shared sense of glory arising from them being fellow members of the Chu clan.The adorable Ji Xiaoxi was also standing amidst the crowd, looking over the questions in interest. Even the slight frown on her face did little to mar her beauty. \u201cHow are these questions supposed to be solved? Should I go back and ask my father about them? Ah, but father isn\u2019t interested in this sort of stuff. He only likes those perverted magazines he has stowed in his room. He seems to have gotten a new book recently, and he\u2019s acting secretly about it. He doesn\u2019t even allow me to come close to it. Hmph\u2026\u201dPei Mianman, dressed in a black cloak that concealed her proud figure, was also watching the spectacle. Her lips inched up into an amused smile as she remarked, \u201cThis fellow sure is an interesting one. Chu Chuyan does have a sharp eye for people. Should I find an opportunity to nab him over to my side? It should be interesting to take her stuff away from her\u2026\u201dHiding at the very back of the crowd was an alarmed Zheng Dan. The reports she had browsed through depicted Zu An to be a good-for-nothing, leaving her with the impression that Zu An was simply lucky at the Silverhook casino to earn 7,500,000 silver taels. She didn\u2019t expect Zu An to actually be this skilled in arithmetic.It looks like it wasn\u2019t just luck at play at the Silverhook Casino. I reckon that Yang Wei will be done in by him, though I sure do wonder who was the one who sent Yang Wei after him.Still, I should probably proceed carefully from now on, lest my honey trap backfires on me.Some time later, Shang Liuyu finally reminded softly, \u201cTeacher Yang, it\u2019s already over time.\u201dYang Wei wiped off the sweat on his face as he said, \u201cGive me a while more, I\u2019m about to be done.\u201dAll along, he had been the one to see students struggling to solve his questions under the time limit. Who could have thought that he would be put in the same position one day?However, with so many people spectating the bet, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to be so shameless as to drag things out for too long. After writing a while longer, he finally put his brush down and said, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201dTo be honest, other than for two questions, he had no confidence in the answers he had provided at all. However, he felt that it shouldn\u2019t be a huge problem. At the very least, he should be able to get ten questions correct at the minimum.He was relieved that he didn\u2019t arrogantly declare that he would get all twenty questions right at the start, or else it would already be all over for him. As long as he could get ten questions correct, it still wouldn\u2019t look too bad on him. After all, everyone here had a taste of just how difficult the questions were.\u201cHow is it? I managed to at least get ten of them right, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Waiting calmly as Zu An checked his answers, Yang Wei slipped his drenched handkerchief back into his pocket as a gleeful smile emerged on his lips.Of the entire Brightmoon City, he was confident that no one would be able to fare better than him on the test\u2014well, maybe except for Zu An the pervert.\u201cAs expected of Teacher Yang, he managed to answer all of the questions!\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s really impressive. I don\u2019t even know how to answer a single question at all.\u201d\u201cTeacher Yang is not our arithmetic teacher for nothing. How can he hold his own without some skills?\u201d\u201cStill, I must say that the questions Zu An came up with are truly tough. His proficiency in arithmetic is definitely at least on par with Teacher Yang.\u201d\u201cI reckon it\u2019s just Teacher Yang going easy on him. There\u2019s no reason for him to take a student so seriously after all.\u201d\u2026Yang Wei felt his back straightening upon hearing the commentary of the students around. It looked like he had managed to build up quite some prestige for himself over the years. He turned to glance at Shang Liuyu as he patted his chest, relieved that he had at least managed to salvage his reputation before her.It was just that Shang Liuyu wasn\u2019t looking at him at all. Her eyes were staring intently at Zu An, curious as to what the results would be.Then, Zu An finally began speaking up, \u201cIs this the level you\u2019re at? It looks like I\u2019ve overestimated you. You didn\u2019t even manage to get a single question correct!\u201dAn uproar broke out in the classroom.\u201cWhat?\u201d Yang Wei thought that he was hearing things. There\u2019s no way I could have gotten everything wrong! He glared at Zu An in aggravation as he hollered furiously, \u201cLies! How dare you slander me!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +1024 Rage!It was just a second ago that he was feeling good about himself, but in the next moment, it was announced before practically everyone in the academy that he hadn\u2019t gotten a single question correct. This sudden nosedive in his emotions was simply too great for him to bear!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHow could I have possibly gotten all of the answers wrong? You must be saying that in order to win the bet! There\u2019s no other reason for that!\u201d Yang Wei glared at Zu An angrily. He was confident that he should have gotten at least ten questions correctly, so there was no way he could believe that he actually got everything wrong.\u201cIndeed! How could Teacher Yang possibly get everything wrong? He\u2019s our academy\u2019s arithmetic teacher!\u201d\u201cZu An is going too far here for lying to win the bet. It only shows how despicable he is as a person!\u201d\u2026Zu An didn\u2019t lose his temper despite all of the criticisms directed at him. Instead, he raised the paper Yang Wei had just completed up high and said, \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll enlighten you on your mistakes then. Look at the first question. The right answer is 2 and 2, and yet you wrote 10 and 15. You must have just made a random guess hoping that you\u2019d somehow get it right.\u201dYang Wei\u2019s face heated up in embarrassment. It was true that he had guessed two random numbers. He simply got more and more confused thinking about it that he eventually gave up. However, there was no way he was going to admit to it. \u201cYour question is simply illogical. Given these conditions, how can anyone possibly deduce the answer?\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Zu An shook his head disdainfully.\u201cSince you don\u2019t understand it, allow me to enlighten you then. A knows the addition of the numbers, but he doesn\u2019t know what each number is. If the addition of the number is 2 or 3, naturally, he would immediately know that the two numbers are (1, 1) and (1, 2) respectively. Similarly, if the addition of the number is 40 or 39, he would know that the numbers are (20, 20) and (20, 19) respectively. With this underlying notion, the boundary of the addition of both numbers is automatically narrowed down to 4 to 38.\u201cLet\u2019s take 4 as an example. If 4 is the addition of both numbers, the two numbers could possibly be (1, 3) or (2, 2), so A is unable to determine which is it.\u201cNow, let\u2019s move over to look at B. If the number B got is a prime number, namely 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, so on and so forth, he would be able to deduce right away that the number is 1 and the multiplied number itself. Those are the only two factors after all. Since he was unable to deduce what the number is right away, we can eliminate all prime numbers.\u201cMoving back to A, assuming that the addition of the numbers is 4, and the multiplication of the numbers isn\u2019t 3\u2014which B immediately know the answer right away since it\u2019s a prime number\u2014it only leaves the combination of (2, 2) that fulfills the criteria.\u201cAs for the other numbers above 4, there are many more possibilities aside from that, such that A is unable to deduce what the two numbers are, and B is unable to follow up with a corresponding deduction too.\u201dAt this point, Zu An shook his head and sighed deeply. \u201cSee, as long as you had the right direction in mind, you would have gotten the answer on your first try. Isn\u2019t it simple? That\u2019s why I chose to put this question at the very front. Yet, who could have thought that you can\u2019t even solve such a simple question? Haaa~\u201dThe surrounding students also began gossiping amongst themselves.\u201cHmmm, the logic is pretty simple now that he has explained it out.\u201d\u201cTsk, why weren\u2019t you able to solve it then?\u201d\u201cI just wasn\u2019t able to think of it on the spot! I mean, even Teacher Yang couldn\u2019t get it right either!\u201d\u2026Hearing those darned mutterings of the student, Yang Wei\u2019s face reddened. \u201cFine, let\u2019s take it that I answered this question wrongly out of carelessness. What about the next question then? Isn\u2019t the probability the same no matter which door is chosen? There\u2019s no way I could be wrong about that!\u201dThat was the question that he was the most confident about.The crowd also murmured in agreement with Yang Wei\u2019s verdict too. \u201cIndeed, the probability should be the same no matter which door is chosen. Whether he chooses to switch to another door or not shouldn\u2019t make a difference.\u201dYang Wei\u2019s words were in line with common sense.However, Zu An sighed deeply and remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the students to get this question wrong, but how could an arithmetic teacher like you make the same mistake too? This sure is\u2026 Hai\u2026\u201dHis irritating attitude of putting Yang Wei down made the latter feeling so angered that he was on the verge of exploding. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put away that mysterious act of yours and point out what\u2019s wrong with my logic?\u201dYou have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +472 Rage!Zu An finally began deciphering the question, \u201cNo matter which door you select, the chances of selecting the treasure is one-third. In other words, the total probability of the treasure being in the two remaining doors is two-third. So, if I remove a wrong answer between the two remaining doors, wouldn\u2019t the probability of the only remaining unchosen door be two-third now? Given so, you should definitely change the door since the chances of getting the treasure are higher!\u201d\u201cRubbish!\u201d said Yang Wei. \u201cThe probability of each door having the treasure behind it is independent. It should all be one-third. How could one of them suddenly become two-third?\u201dIn response to that, Zu An shook his head and answered, \u201cI reckon that someone of your IQ won\u2019t be able to answer such a complicated logic. Well, let me phrase it in a much easier way for you. Assuming that there are 10,000 doors before you, and only one of them has a treasure behind it. If you choose any of the 10,000 doors, your chances of getting the treasure is only 1-in-10,000, right? With such probability, it\u2019s almost impossible for you to get it right. It\u2019s almost certain that the treasure is in the remaining 9,999 doors.\u201cSo, if I open 9,998 of the remaining 9,999 doors and show them they are all empty, given the same question, will you be willing to switch to the other remaining door?\u201d\u201cOf course I would switch!\u201d replied Yang Wei subconsciously. However, right after he responded, his complexion suddenly darkened. Could I really be wrong about that?\u201cAs expected of an arithmetic teacher, you sure got it fast enough. It looks like you aren\u2019t beyond salvage yet.\u201d Zu An nodded in satisfaction.Yang Wei looked as if steam was rising from the tip of his head. This fellow looks like he\u2019s praising me on the surface, but why do his words sound so jarring?You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +333 Rage!Zu An proceeded on to decipher the next question. \u201cMoving on to the next question about the pirates, the optimal distribution of ki stones for Pirate A is (97, 0, 1, 2, 0) or (97, 0, 1, 0, 2). Look are your own answer. Is it right?\u201dYang Wei immediately refuted Zu An\u2019s answer in agitation. \u201cNonsense! Pirate A would practically be taking all of it for his own. How could the other pirates possibly agree to it?!\u201d\u201cI told you that these pirates are smart people who are able to rationally weigh their gains and losses and make the best decision. If we were to put you in their place, I reckon that you would be dead by now!\u201d replied Zu An with a shake of his head.Without bothering to keep the suspense, he quickly proceeded to the answer, \u201cLet\u2019s work on this question backward, starting from Pirate E. He\u2019s the safest one of them all since he\u2019s in no threat of being thrown into the sea. Thus, his strategy is the simplest. As long as everyone ahead of him dies, he\u2019d be able to monopolize all 100 ki stones.\u201cMoving on, regarding Pirate D, whether he survives or not depends on whether there are any survivors in front of him. If it ever comes down to a situation when only he and Pirate E is left, Pirate E is bound to oppose his distribution no matter what and feed him to the sharks so as to monopolize all of the ki stones. Thus, Pirate D is inclined to support Pirate C for his own survival.\u201cAs for Pirate C, based on the logic of Pirate D, he would surely propose (100, 0, 0) since he knew that Pirate D would surely support him unconditionally in order to avoid getting killed by Pirate E. With his and Pirate D\u2019s vote, he would be able to get the majority for his distribution proposal and monopolize all 100 ki stones safely.\u201cHowever, Pirate B, as a perfectly logical thinker, is aware of Pirate C\u2019s distribution plan, so what he would do is to propose a distribution of (98, 0, 1, 1). Pirate D and Pirate E would be inclined to support him since they would be able to receive 1 ki stone, which is more beneficial to them as compared to Pirate C\u2019s distribution plan. With that, he would be able to get the majority and monopolize 98 ki stones to himself.\u201cUnfortunately, Pirate A is also no pushover. After analyzing everyone\u2019s strategy, he is aware of the scheme Pirate B is cooking up. So, he chooses to give up on Pirate B, who is likely to vote against him regardless of what he offers, and proposes a distribution of (97, 0, 1, 2, 0) or (97, 0, 1, 0, 2). With this proposal, Pirate C and Pirate D or Pirate E would be able to receive more than what they would earn in Pirate B\u2019s distribution. Since that\u2019s the case, they would support Pirate A, thus allowing Pirate A to secure three votes and claim a majority. With this, he easily secures 97 ki stones for himself.\u201dEveryone gasped in astonishment. \u201cAren\u2019t those pirates way too smart?\u201d\u201cHow frightening it would be if the pirates in real life are that smart too!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a hypothetical situation. If anyone is that smart, he doesn\u2019t even have to resort to piracy anymore!\u201d\u201cI guess so\u2026\u201d\u2026Yang Wei\u2019s eyes had already blanked out. He stood dazed on the spot, unable to hear anything at all.Zu An was quite displeased with his reaction. Hey hey hey, can you not succumb so easily? You haven\u2019t provided me with enough Rage points yet!To his dismay, even as he slammed Yang Wei\u2019s answers down and explained the remaining questions, the latter only provided him with a few hundred Rage points. From the looks of it, he had already suffered a mental breakdown.\u201cMy gosh, he really didn\u2019t get a single question right! Isn\u2019t Teacher Yang a little too incompetent?\u201d\u201cHe always sticks up nose up high as if he\u2019s a big deal. Yet, it turns out that he\u2019s all talk!\u201d\u201cTsk, why does our academy have someone like him as a teacher? Won\u2019t he mislead the students at this rate?\u201d\u2026The criticisms of the surrounding students were like knives stabbing into Yang Wei\u2019s heart. He finally caved in and roared frenziedly before rushing out of the classroom with his hands covering his ears. No matter how anyone shouted at him, he didn\u2019t stop at all. He only wanted to get out of this darned place as soon as possible.It was too humiliating! He thought that he could easily trample all over Zu An, but who could have thought that he would end up being the one trampled on instead? After this incident, there was no way he would dare to show his face in Brightmoon Academy anymore.For a teacher to be unable to answer any of the questions posed by his students, he would definitely become a laughingstock not just in Brightmoon City but the surrounding municipalities too!\u201cBoss, you\u2019re incredible!\u201d Wei Suo rushed forward to massage Zu An\u2019s shoulders.The other students also stepped forward to offer him tea and snacks. With such arithmetic prowess, even if he was completely inept as a cultivator, he would still have a bright future ahead of him. Naturally, it would be good if they could fawn on him right now.Chu Huanzhao was also going to rush forward to talk to her brother-in-law, but a huge crowd had already formed around Zu An before she knew it, squeezing her out. Frustrated, she stomped away with a cold harrumph, \u201cBootlickers!\u201dJi Xiaoxi\u2019s face was also reddened in excitement at the impressive feat she had just witnessed, but at the same time, she was worried for Zu An too. Won\u2019t he be in trouble for offending a teacher of the academy like this?Pei Mianman\u2019s lips curled upward with a hint of seduction, leaving the men around her swooning for her. \u201cI was still regretting my decision for making a deal with that fellow, but it looks like I might just be able to get something out of him.\u201dNot too far away, Zheng Dan caught sight of the reactions of those women, and it shocked her. She thought that Zu An\u2019s relationships with them were just hearsay\u2014how could Zu An possibly charm all of these outstanding women?It was then that a loud bellow sounded. \u201cWhat are all of you doing here instead of attending classes? Are you trying to rebel against the academy?\u201dThe voice sent shudders down people\u2019s spine. This was an instinctive effect arising from the traumas created by their past experiences with the owner of the voice.A middle-aged man sporting a bald spot on his head and holding onto a ruler approached the crowd. Who else could it be other than discipline master Lu De?The crowd automatically parted to open up a path for him to walk through. At the very center of the commotion, he saw Zu An seated grandly on a chair, served by his fellow students. This sight made him frown a little.However, when he saw that Shang Liuyu was in the vicinity as well, his frown immediately smoothened out. \u201cAh, Teacher Shang is here too! What in the world happened here earlier? I saw Yang Wei rushing off with his head lowered. I called for him, but he wouldn\u2019t respond.\u201d\u201cHe probably feels embarrassed,\u201d replied Shang Liuyu with a faint smile. She quickly explained the events that had transpired earlier. Her smooth voice seemed to tingle one\u2019s heart, making it pleasurable just to listen to her speak.\u201cIt\u2019s you again?\u201d Lu De was still looking at Shang Liuyu with a gentle look on his a moment ago, but as soon as he turned his eyes toward Zu An, his expression turned severe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe immense pressure that was pouring out of Lu De\u2019s eyes immediately sent Wei Suo and the others retreating into the background as none of them dared to remain by Zu An\u2019s side anymore.Those disloyal bastards, Zu An thought. He calmly returned the gaze to Lu De and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Yang Wei who picked on me first. He was the one who proposed this bet in the first place. Why am I the troublemaker for going along with him here?\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten our academy rules? The most important value we embrace is to respect the teachers. No matter how capable you are, if you don\u2019t even have the basic respect for your elders, you\u2019ll only eventually become a menace to the world once you\u2019re out of the academy!\u201d Lu De berated sternly.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t concur with your words. A student respecting his teacher should be based on the precondition that his teacher is a good role model. However, Yang Wei intentionally picked on his students due to his personal reasons. Is such a person worthy of being respected as a teacher?\u201d replied Zu An with a frown.\u201cBut he\u2019s still your teacher! Even if there\u2019s an issue with him, you should leave it to the academy to investigate the matter. How can a student like you attempt to deal with him on your own accord?\u201d Seeing how Zu An still dared to talk back, Lu De became even angrier.\u201cWhat do you mean by dealing with him on my own accord? Our bet was open and fair. Everyone present can testify on my behalf,\u201d said Zu An as he gestured to the students around. \u201cWe invited Teacher Shang here to be our witness so as to ensure that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the proceedings.\u201dShang Liuyu nodded in agreement. \u201cIndeed. Teacher Yang has also agreed to it as well.\u201d\u201cTeacher Shang, don\u2019t be fooled by this fellow!\u201d Lu De shot a smile at Shang Liuyu before turning back to Zu An with a stern face. \u201cYou really are a gambler through and through, huh? One of our ten core academy rules is the disallowing of gambling, but you actually openly walked into the Silverhook Casino to gamble your money, causing a huge uproar. Do you know what kind of negative influence you have brought to our academy? I haven\u2019t even settled the score with you on that, but you\u2019re even betting against a teacher in the academy now? Hmph, we don\u2019t need a person like you in our academy. You should return to your Chu Estate!\u201dThose words stirred a huge commotion from the surrounding crowd. No one could have imagined that Lu De would dish out such a severe punishment, expelling Zu An on the spot.Given Lu De\u2019s strength and standing in the academy, no one would dare to doubt his authority to do so.Hong Xingying, who was hiding behind the crowd, sneered coldly. You sure acted arrogantly, huh? Look, retribution has finally caught up with you! It must be humiliating for you to be expelled from the academy. Do you know how much the Chu clan values its reputation? You can be darned sure that the Master and Madame won\u2019t spare you easily!Just two days ago, Hong Zhong had warned him to keep himself in check. In order not to put his father in a spot, Hong Xingying wisely decided to stop messing with Zu An and focused his efforts on cultivating instead.He was in the midst of cultivating earlier today when he suddenly heard a commotion. So, he followed the crowd over to take a look, but he ended up seeing Zu An in the limelight instead. This left him with an awful feeling as if he had eaten shit.Not wanting to watch anymore, he turned around to leave, only to witness his dramatic turnaround right after. He was more than exhilarated to see this twist of event, and he decided that he would add two dishes for his lunch later on to celebrate.Another one who shared Hong Xingying\u2019s feelings was Yuan Wendong. He had always been a proud and lofty figure in the academy over the years, respected by many. He was hoping to broadcast his breakthrough to the fifth rank with a huge bang, but it ended up getting foiled due to Zu An.He wouldn\u2019t have felt so stifled if he had lost to an expert, but of all people, it had to be the trash he had been looking down upon all this while, Zu Wastrel An! The feeling of humiliation was amplified severalfold, such that he would rather be killed instead!When he saw Zu An sitting haughtily on the chair with crossed legs when he arrived at the scene, he immediately felt an urge to step forward to teach the latter a lesson. However, he swiftly noticed that Pei Mianman was amongst the crowd as well. The experience from his previous defeat to her immediately deflated his motivation. He could totally imagine Zu An shamelessly summoning his harem of women as soon as he tried to make a move, so he could only hold himself back.Just as he was feeling stifled about it all, Lu De\u2019s arrival brought about an unexpected development, chasing away the heavy feeling in his chest.Meanwhile, Zu An also noticed the bits of Rage points from Hong Xingying and Yuan Wendong. Those two fellows are really persistent like cockroaches. However, this wasn\u2019t the time to be bothered about them. He was just about to answer Lu De\u2019s words when Chu Huanzhao suddenly stepped forward to join the fray.\u201cDiscipline Master Lu, you\u2019re really going too far here. How can you expel my brother-in-law just like that? It\u2019s not like he gambled in the academy. Besides, can the bet he made with the arithmetic teacher even be considered a gamble? In the first place, the one who proposed the bet is that Yang Wei, so why aren\u2019t you punishing him then?\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed with a reddened face.Zu An shot her a thumbs up. It looks like it\u2019s always the sister-in-law who really cares for the brother-in-law. At least I didn\u2019t suffer the vicious lashing of the Wailing Whip for nothing back then.Lu De calmly responded to the agitated Chu Huanzhao, \u201cFor privately proposing a bet to a student despite being a teacher of the academy, he\u2019s henceforth expelled from Brightmoon Academy. What else do you have to say?\u201dThe abrupt dropping of the expulsion notice generated a huge uproar in the classroom once more. While one of the conditions of the bet was for Yang Wei to back out of the academy on his own accord, that was, after all, just a verbal promise. If Yang Wei\u2019s skin was thick enough, he could still choose to shamelessly hang around.However, things were different now that the academy had officially expelled him. Yang Wei wouldn\u2019t be able to return anymore, and it was likely that no other academies in the prefecture would dare to hire him too.Chu Huanzhao still wanted to say a word or two in protest, but Lu De shot her a glance and said, \u201cSpeaking of which, Chu Second Miss has colluded with this fellow to deceive me at the entrance of the academy not too long ago. I haven\u2019t settled that score with you yet.\u201dUnder Lu De\u2019s sharp eyes, Chu Huanzhao cowered out of intimidation. She was still young at the moment, so it was inevitable that she would find it hard to stand against someone of Lu De\u2019s caliber.Zu An also finally came to a realization. It\u2019s no wonder why I feel like this fellow is picking on me. So it\u2019s due to that matter back then! Still, isn\u2019t he a bit too stingy here?Shang Liuyu also interjected with a slightly cold expression on her face too, \u201cGoing by Disciple Master Lu\u2019s words, shouldn\u2019t I, as the witness of their bet, be punished as well?\u201d\u201cTeacher Shang, that\u2019s not my intention. It\u2019s out of your kindness that you\u2019re trying to uphold fairness here, so naturally, it isn\u2019t appropriate to punish you for it.\u201d Lu De put on his most handsome smile as he answered Shang Liuyu\u2019s question. It was just that his receding hairline made him look less-than-charming.\u201cTsk!\u201d The crowd immediately clicked their tongue.But of course, none of them dared to really voice their criticisms toward Lu De\u2019s actions. Well, except for one.\u201cAiyo, Discipline Master Lu. You sure are exemplifying the very meaning of \u2018double standards\u2019 here.\u201dZu An blinked his eyes in surprise. The voice was smooth and sweet, so logically speaking, it ought to belong to a gorgeous woman. But for some reason, he felt that something was a little off about it.With his sharp eyes, he noticed Lu De\u2019s cheeks twitching a little in response to those words. Not only so, but many of the male students also gulped down their saliva fearfully. Some of their bodies even began trembling uncontrollably.In comparison, the female students were acting more normally.The scent of perfume drifted over along with the wind, filling the classroom with a pleasant aroma. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the scent had come from a renowned brand.Following that, a slim figure came into Zu An\u2019s vision. White robe, long hair, shapely eyebrows, peach blossom eyes, and delicate facial features\u2014if this person wasn\u2019t a man, he would surely have countless pursuers after him.In terms of appearance, Zu An felt that the only one who could possibly match him was Xie Xiu. However, even though Xie Xiu had a delicate, feminine appearance, his disposition and gestures were masculine, making it impossible to misunderstand his gender.However, the man standing before him at the moment had a feminine disposition that made it really hard to distinguish if he was a guy or a girl. Be it the way he naturally crossed his arms before his chest or the way he shook his bum as he walked, one couldn\u2019t help but sense a feminine vibe coming from him.\u201cWho\u2019s that person?\u201dZu An was, after all, someone who had been through the information era. He had seen all kinds of ungodly existences on the internet, and in comparison to them, this man felt perfectly normal. At the very least, he had quite a beautiful appearance, so it wasn\u2019t too offputting.Instead, what he was more curious about was the man\u2019s identity.Unfortunately, Wei Suo had already run off to hide by one corner, so he couldn\u2019t provide Zu An with timely intelligence. Instead, it was Shang Liuyu who secretly whispered the answer to him, \u201cHe\u2019s Bai Susu, a teacher in charge of imparting cultivation in the academy. The Yellow class has very few cultivation classes, and you\u2019ve only arrived just a few days ago. It\u2019s only normal for you to not know of him.\u201d\u201cBai Susu\u2026\u201d Zu An couldn\u2019t help but find the name rather odd on a man.\u201cAiyo~\u201d Lu De imitated the same feminine tone Bai Susu used earlier when he spoke before spitting in disdain. \u201cAs a guy, can you not be so disgusting? You\u2019re really raising my goosebumps here!\u201d\u201cYou treated little sister Shang so kindly earlier, yet you act so crudely with me?\u201d Bai Susu harrumphed \u2018coyly\u2019. \u201cHow do I pale in comparison to little sister Shang? Is it my looks?\u201d\u201cUweh~\u201dThe surrounding crowd finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and hurriedly dispersed.Even Shang Liuyu\u2019s carefree smile looked a little stiff at the moment. Clearly, she was a little conflicted at being used as a comparison.Lu De\u2019s face darkened. \u201cBai Susu, don\u2019t butt into things you have no business in. Scram!\u201d\u201cHaiyoh! Look at what you\u2019re saying!\u201d Bai Susu raised his hand daintily. If he had a handkerchief in hand, it would have really resembled how female artisans in brothels tended to beckon for customers. \u201cThey\u2019re my students too, so how is this possibly be none of my business?\u201dZu An widened his eyes in realization. It was now made clear to him that Bai Susu was at loggerheads with Lu De. It looked like he would do well to hug tightly onto the latter\u2019s slender thighs in the future.However, just thinking about how Bai Susu tended to conduct himself, he couldn\u2019t help but gulp down his saliva once more. Can it be that this fellow likes guys? What am I to do if he lusts for my dashing face?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSo what if he\u2019s your student? All students in this academy are subjected to the academy rules!\u201d Lu De\u2019s eyelids wouldn\u2019t stop twitching after seeing Bai Susu\u2019s dainty gestures. He felt a strong urge to dig a hole and bury Bai Susu in it. \u201cZu An has flouted the academy rules by partaking in a gamble and publicly talking back to a teacher in the academy compound. Regardless of which it is, it\u2019s more than enough to have him fired from the academy.\u201dTo be frank, Zu An wasn\u2019t too worried about this matter. One must know that he had a backing in the academy now. However, since Bai Susu had stepped out to help him, he was more than willing to take a back seat to watch the show.Bai Susu shook his head and replied, \u201cBig brother Lu, it looks like you have some misunderstanding here. Zu An did gamble in the Silverhook Casino, but it\u2019s outside the academy. As far as I know, the academy rules only apply within the academy itself. As for talking back to a teacher, I\u2019ve already heard about the ins and outs of the matter. It\u2019s Yang Wei who proposed the bet, and Zu An was pressured into accepting it.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to punish him over this, wouldn\u2019t others think that our academy is blatantly siding with a teacher to pick on a student despite him having lost a bet? That would truly be a huge scandal. Word would spread beyond Brightmoon City to the entire country. By then, the world will think of us, teachers of Brightmoon Academy, as cowards who can\u2019t take a loss.\u201dThe intimate \u2018big brother Lu\u2019 address from Bai Susu made Lu De shudder in disgust.To be fair, Bai Susu\u2019s point did make some sense, but just the knowledge that it was his old nemesis raising this point was more than enough reason for Lu De to disregard his opinion. It was similar to how Bai Susu had no particular ties with Zu An and was basically intervening in this matter just to annoy Lu De.This made Lu De even more reluctant to give in. \u201cHmph, I am the discipline master of the academy. I have the final say as to how students should be dealt with. Teacher Bai, your interference is not needed here!\u201dBai Susu placed his arms on his hips in displeasure as he berated Lu De, \u201cHey, are you just going to blatantly ignore all reason here? This is an abuse of power! I\u2019ll report you for that!\u201dLu De burst into laughter. \u201cGo ahead then. Even if you report this matter up to the capital, this matter is still under my jurisdiction. If you have any disagreements with my judgment, why don\u2019t we settle it with a fight then?\u201d\u201cHmph, let\u2019s do it then! I\u2019m not afraid of you!\u201d Bai Susu harrumphed.He took out a plum blossom flower from his robe as a powerful aura burst out from him. All of the students in the surroundings were forced to retreat hurriedly under his exertion of force.Seeing how the other students were struggling to cope with Bai Susu\u2019s sudden show of force, Zu An was intrigued as to why nothing was happening to him. However, he soon noticed that Shang Liuyu was standing casually in front of him, and he fell into deep thoughts.Meanwhile, seeing that Bai Susu had taken out his plum blossom flower, Lu De\u2019s expression turned grave. He raised his ruler upward, ready to strike his enemy down.In contrast to the flustered students of the Black class and Yellow class, those from the Sky class and Earth class looked at the brewing battle with an excited look in their eyes. These two people were true sixth rank experts, and they were likely the strongest cultivators in the academy aside from the principal.A battle between sixth rank experts was definitely not common; many people lived their life without having an opportunity to see this grand spectacle. Naturally, they weren\u2019t going to miss this precious opportunity to see them in action.Yuan Wendong stared unblinkingly at the two teachers as he waited for the battle to commence. He was hoping to see if he could get some inspiration from their battle so as to aid in his breakthrough in the future. Even though there was only a rank of difference between them, there were many people in the world who were stuck on the fifth rank in their entire life, unable to take the final step forward.Only Pei Mianman yawned in boredom as she shot a glance in Zu An\u2019s direction. She noticed that he was staring at Shang Liuyu\u2019s beautiful side profile, and her lips curled into a smile. What a pervert he is.A tense atmosphere lingered in the surroundings. Bai Susu\u2019s face turned grim, and Lu De looked as if he was glaring at a mortal enemy. The two of them assessed each other with great focus, searching for openings to strike at.\u201cYou have been staring at each other for a long time now. Are you two going to fight or what?\u201dIn this moment where everyone\u2019s nerves were strung up, a lazy voice suddenly broke the atmosphere. The crowd turned their eyes over, only to see Zu An stretching his back lazily.You have successfully trolled Bai Susu for +666 Rage!You have successfully trolled Lu De for +666 Rage!Everyone was also shocked by Zu An\u2019s remark. He actually dares to offend Lu De and Bai Susu at once. What a brave man he is!Zu An also felt helpless about it too. What can I do? A man has to earn his keep. My calling as a keyboard warrior requires me to put my head out.Bai Susu and Lu De exchanged glances, and there was a rare moment of telepathic connection between the two enemies: Let\u2019s call it even for now and get rid of this shameless fellow first, alright?But before they could make a move, a cold, authoritative voice suddenly boomed, \u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201dBai Susu and Lu De widened their eyes in shock, and they hurriedly kept away their weapons. They respectfully bowed toward the person walking toward them, greeting, \u201cPaying respects to the principal.\u201d\u201cPaying respects to the principal!\u201d\u201cPaying respects to the principal!\u201d\u2026The other teachers and students did the same too.Zu An was rather surprised at this sight. He never thought that the gorgeous principal would actually command such a high level of authority in this world.A beautiful figure slowly walked over. Her skin was as fair as snow; her long, slender neck felt noble and lofty; her hair was pinned gracefully in place. Her ravishing look was more than enough to awe anyone. It was just that she had sharp, piercing eyes that gave her an air of imposing authority.Her slender legs, wrapped tightly in skin-colored stocking, vaguely peaked through her fluttering skirt, fully showcasing her physical charms.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but wonder if all of these people were intentionally bowing down in order to sneak peeks at her legs. At the very least, he could be certain that one of them was.Wei Suo was currently staring intently at Jiang Luofu\u2019s eyes with an impassioned look in his eyes. He looked incredibly excited, and he kept gulping.That idiot!Zu An clicked his tongue in disdain. He subconsciously shot a look at Shang Liuyu and noticed that she was wearing a longer skirt today that only revealed bits of her heels. He couldn\u2019t help but remember the time they spent in the gazebo, where she sat casually and revealed her smooth thighs. If he had to compare between the two, Shang Liuyu\u2019s legs definitely didn\u2019t pale in comparison to Jiang Luofu\u2019s.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Shang Liuyu asked curiously.Zu An replied with a smile, \u201cActually, you should consider wearing a slightly shorter skirt. It\u2019d be a pity to conceal the beautiful legs you have.\u201dShang Liuyu was first taken aback before a tinge of redness covered her face. \u201cIf not for our previous meeting in the gazebo, you wouldn\u2019t get away with making such remarks. A student should act like a student; don\u2019t go around casually teasing your teachers.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean that it\u2019ll be fine as long as I do it seriously?\u201d asked Zu An.A bizarre look surfaced on Shang Liuyu\u2019s face. \u201cYour personality sure is\u2026 It\u2019s no wonder why so many people want to deal with you even though it has only been days since you enrolled in the academy.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re just jealous of how handsome and lovable I am. Have you noticed that there hasn\u2019t been any woman in the academy who has tried to deal with me yet?\u201d Zu An pointed out with a shrug.Those words surprised Shang Liuyu. That\u2019s true. Those who have been trying to deal with him are all men. On the other hand, it\u2019s always a woman who stands up for him during his times of crisis. Even Bai Susu, who can somewhat be considered a woman, is also siding with him too.Their secret whispers swiftly caught Jiang Luofu\u2019s attention. She couldn\u2019t help but harrumph under his breath. This fellow told me that he doesn\u2019t know Shang Liuyu, huh? Look at just how chummy the two of them are!She was familiar with Shang Liuyu\u2019s character. The latter had a carefree and gentle personality that made it seem easy to get along with her, but in truth, she always made sure to maintain some distance with others. Beneath her warm exterior lay a cold and reticent heart. She had never chatted so intimately with someone else before.After a brief look, Jiang Luofu cleared her throat and glared at Lu De and Bai Susu. \u201cWhat are the two of you doing? Despite being teachers, the two of you are actually intending to fight on the academy compound before the eyes of so many students?\u201dBai Susu chuckled under his hand and said, \u201cBig sister Jiang, you\u2019re misunderstanding us. This fellow kept picking on one of our students for no reason. If you don\u2019t believe my words, you can feel free to ask anyone here.\u201dLu De nearly exploded upon hearing Bai Susu pinning the blame on him. However, he dared not to act up in the presence of Jiang Luofu. He quickly formulated his argument and explained, \u201cPrincipal, Zu An has no respect for his elders, and he goes around gambling with others. He\u2019s tarnishing the conducive learning environment of our academy by propagating bad habits. Under such grounds, I decided to have him expelled from the academy. Yet, this fellow simply had to stand in my way!\u201dSeeing how the two of them were throwing the blame on one another, Jiang Luofu heaved a helpless sigh before waving her hand. \u201cEnough! The two of you can cut it out. I\u2019ve already understood the situation. Since it was Teacher Yang who proposed the bet, he should face the consequences for it lest our academy becomes a laughingstock to the rest of the world.\u201d\u2026Yang Wei had dashed out due the overwhelming humiliation he had suffered, but once he calmed down, he realized that there was no need for him to worry about this. Be it his title as an official formally appointed by the royal court, his widespread reputation in Brightmoon City, or the connections he possessed, the power he wielded in society definitely far exceeded that of Zu An. It wasn\u2019t worth it for him to run out and lose his job.So, he bucked up his courage and marched back to the classroom. He had resolved himself to stick around as a teacher even if he couldn\u2019t raise his head in the academy anymore. It might be humiliating, but he would bear with it.But as soon as he arrived in the classroom, he found himself met with Jiang Luofu\u2019s verdict, leaving his heart sinking into the depths of despair.Thinking about just how much courage he had to pull together in order to return, he told himself that he couldn\u2019t just accept things ending like that. So, he stepped forward and said, \u201cMy position as a teacher is formally appointed by the royal court, as evidenced by the records in the Ministry of Rites. Even if you\u2019re the principal, you don\u2019t have the power to expel me like this!\u201dLoud boos echoed all around. No one thought that Yang Wei would actually be so shameless as to return after everything that had happened..\u201cDespite being an arithmetic teacher, you got outdone by a student in your field of expertise. Our academy does not need an inept teacher. I\u2019ll personally write a report to the Ministry of Rites to have your position as a teacher formally revoked,\u201d said Jiang Luofu coldly.There was no way someone of her wits wouldn\u2019t be able to figure that Yang Wei was intentionally picking on Zu An. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to guess who the mastermind was, so she decided to simply kick him off and end things there.Had Zu An been an ordinary student, she would still have to weigh the pros and cons before coming to a decision. But he wasn\u2019t. As the lofty principal of Brightmoon Academy, she could shrug of his identity as the drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan, but the same couldn\u2019t be said about his transcendent class aptitude and all of the mysterious events occurring around him.She couldn\u2019t allow someone with limitless potential to be stifled in her academy. Compared to what he could become in the future, a mere third rank official was nothing at all.Yang Wei was utterly appalled to hear those words. There was no way he could bring himself to continue lingering around after that remark. He ran away in a fluster, not wanting to stay here for even a second more. Just thinking about that gleeful smile that would be on Zu An\u2019s hateful face made him want to rip his mouth off.You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +999 Rage!Zu An was speechless to see the notification on the system. Wait a moment, it was the principal who stripped you of your position, so why are you blaming me for that? Wow, you really are a loser who picks on the weak.Yang Wei\u2019s mind was consumed with rage. It\u2019s all that bitch\u2019s fault for sending me here. It should have been an easy affair, yet I ended up suffering such a grievous humiliation. That bitch better have an explanation for me, or else I swear that I\u2019ll make her suffer for this!Lu De frowned at the unsightly sight of the fleeing Yang Wei. Shaking his head, he turned to Jiang Luofu and said, \u201cPrincipal, I do agree that Yang Wei had it coming. However, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Zu An talked back to his teacher and gambled on academy grounds. Shouldn\u2019t he be punished for his deeds?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDiscipline Master Lu, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s more of a contract rather than a gamble. I believe that you\u2019re overexaggerating this matter. Contracts have binding power, and since Zu An won, it\u2019s only expected for Yang Wei to fulfill the end of his promise,\u201d replied Jiang Luofu.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Lu De still wanted to argue about the matter.Jiang Luofu looked at Lu De calmly and asked, \u201cAre you doubting my words?\u201dLu De\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly lowered his head and said, \u201cI dare not to!\u201dZu An was excited to watch this scene. The domineering aura of the gorgeous principal is amazing! Even the fierce Lu De looks no more than a hatchling in her face. Tsk tsk tsk, looks like I really have to hug onto her big thighs tightly.The surrounding crowd also nodded in agreement too. They felt that it was Yang Wei who started the conflict in the first place, and he had it coming. Lu De\u2019s intervention was simply unnecessary.That being said, no one dared to step forward to speak up for Zu An out of fear of offending Lu De. It was not as if they were friends with Zu An anyway, so there was no reason for them to put themselves out for him. Nevertheless, to them, the principal\u2019s verdict was still a satisfactory conclusion to the incident.Of course, there were also some who didn\u2019t like how the matter ended, such as Yuan Wendong, Hong Xingying, and Ye Chenliang. They thought that the principal had come at a bad time. For some reason, every time Zu An got into trouble, there would always be someone to clean his backside for him. What\u2019s with his goddamned luck?!You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for +444 Rage!You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +444 Rage!You have successfully trolled Ye Chenliang for +444 Rage!\u2026Zu An welcomed the inflow of Rage points, but he still thought that it was too little. Looks like I should try to enrage a few more short-tempered prodigies during my time here.It was then that Jiang Luofu suddenly spoke up. \u201cSince Yang Wei has been fired, our academy doesn\u2019t have an arithmetic teacher at the moment. It just so happens that there\u2019s a clause in the contract between Yang Wei and Zu An for the latter to take over his position, so until a new arithmetic teacher is appointed, all arithmetic classes in the academy will be handled by him.\u201dQueer silence descended upon the crowd. All eyes turned toward Zu An.\u201c???\u201d Lu De.\u201c???\u201d Bai Susu.\u201c???\u201d Shang Liuyu.\u201c???\u201d All students.Even Pei Mianman, who was still laughing at the situation, had her smile frozen in place. What\u2019s going on? Doesn\u2019t that mean that I\u2019ll have to call that fellow \u2018teacher\u2019 from now on?\u201dBeing suddenly placed in the center of attention was hard to bear even for the thick-skinned Zu An. He subconsciously turned to look at Jiang Luofu, only to see the latter winking back at him. It was then that he suddenly remembered his request of being an honorary teacher for 7,500,000 silver taels earlier this morning. Back then, she had rejected it without any hesitation, so why would she change her mind all of a sudden?But that wasn\u2019t important right now. What was more important was to exploit this situation to earn a huge wave of Rage points!So, he started off with a light cough before turning to Lu De, Bai Susu, and Shang Liuyu, saying, \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll be colleagues from this day onward. Please take good care of me.\u201dYou have successfully trolled Lu De for +999 Rage!You have successfully trolled Bai Susu for +999 Rage!How in the world is this fellow worthy of being put in the same position as the rest of us?!On the other hand, Zu An felt a bit regretful that Shang Liuyu didn\u2019t offer any Rage points to him. It seems like she has a pretty good impression of me.Anyway, after earning a wave from the teachers, he turned to the students all around and sighed deeply. \u201cI would love to keep a low profile too, but it\u2019s a pity that my talents and skills don\u2019t permit me to do so. Forget it, there\u2019s no choice then. From today onward, I\u2019ll have to ask all of you to call me Teacher Zu.\u201dA huge uproar broke out there and then.Why is this fellow acting so smug? I want to beat him up!You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for +999 Rage!You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +999 Rage!You have successfully trolled Ye Chenliang for +999 Rage!What the hell is going on? Have I gone mad, or is this world bonkers? How could this trash become a teacher of the academy?You have successfully trolled Student Spectator A for +222 Rage!You have successfully trolled Student Spectator B for +222 Rage!\u2026The massive inflow of Rage points charged up Zu An\u2019s happy-o-meter, perfectly exemplifying the concept of schadenfreude. Ahh, my classmates sure are cute. You all really don\u2019t need to be so kind!That being said, their murderous gazes were still pretty terrifying, so Zu An quickly hid behind Shang Liuyu and asked, \u201cBig sister Shang, you\u2019ll protect me if these students were to pick on me, right?\u201dShang Liuyu took in a deep breath before answering, \u201cI honestly want to give you a beating too.\u201dIt was also at this point that Lu De finally snapped out of his shock and exclaimed in horror, \u201cPrincipal, how can we appoint a student as a teacher?!\u201d\u201cIs there anything wrong with it?\u201d replied Jiang Luofu calmly. \u201cIn the history of our Great Zhou Dynasty, there are plenty of outstanding students who decided to stay on in their academy to teach their juniors.\u201d\u201cBut those are outstanding students, talented individuals who possess capabilities far surpassing others. How could Zu An be put on the same pedestal as them?\u201d remarked Lu De.Lu De would have used even more extreme words to express his frustrations if not for the fact that the person standing before him was Jiang Luofu.Bai Susu also belatedly returned back to reality, and he swiftly chirped in with a coy smile, \u201cDiscipline Master Lu, your words don\u2019t make much sense here. He\u2019s being appointed as an arithmetic teacher, not a cultivation teacher. Whether he\u2019s strong or not has nothing to do with this. Zu An has already proved his outstanding talent in arithmetic in his earlier competition with Yang Wei. With the ability he has displayed thus far, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with appointing him as our arithmetic teacher.\u201dTo be fair, Bai Susu did think that it was making light of teachers to appoint Zu An just like that, but seeing Lu De\u2019s vehement opposition to Zu An\u2019s appointment swiftly changed his mind. Over the years, he had clashed with Lu De innumerable times, and neither of them could stand the other. Thus, whatever Lu De opposed, he would support, and vice-versa.Lu De\u2019s face turned grim. \u201cBai Susu, now isn\u2019t the time for us to be arguing with one another! Are you really willing to see a student like him becoming a teacher of our academy? That would make our academy the laughingstock of the world!\u201d\u201cHow would it make our academy a laughingstock?\u201d Bai Susu said with a dainty wave of his hand. \u201cAnyone who dares to mock us should just step forward and challenge Zu An to an arithmetic competition. We\u2019ll silence them all with our true capability!\u201dLu De was choked up by Bai Susu\u2019s argument. Even he had to admit that Zu An was a prodigy in arithmetic. After all, Yang Wei was publicly known to be the most talented arithmetician in the surrounding municipalities, but he still ended up suffering such a tragic defeat. It was hard to imagine that there would be anyone who would be a match for Zu An.It was then that Jiang Luofu spoke up, \u201cYou need not worry about that. He\u2019s just filling in the spot for the time being. He isn\u2019t an officially employed teacher with his records detailed in the Ministry of Rites. Once the Ministry of Rites appoints a new teacher here, I\u2019ll relieve him of his position. Also, aside from arithmetic lessons, Zu An, you\u2019ll continue to attend lessons like any other student. You don\u2019t have any objections about that, right?\u201dThis fellow sure is a troublemaker. Just a moment after I appoint him a position, he immediately begins parading it around like a proud cat with its tail stuck in the air. It literally took only moments for him to offend the entire academy. I\u2019m finally starting to see why he has been slacking off all of these years. Given his troublemaking aptitude, if he doesn\u2019t feign weak, it\u2019s only a matter of time before his enemies send real experts to assassinate him.Zu An quickly replied sheepishly, \u201cYes, I have no objections.\u201dDo I look like I have no objections? You\u2019re just using me as an unpaid part-time worker here!That being said, there was no way Zu An would dare to voice his objections out loud. While there was no doubt that Zu An had been going around offending people, he hadn\u2019t been doing it indiscriminately. He could sensitively discern who were the ones he could offend and who he couldn\u2019t. One person that he absolutely shouldn\u2019t offend at this point was Jiang Luofu, his greatest backing. He was still hoping to clutch onto her thighs tightly for the time being, so it wouldn\u2019t be good to annoy her too much.On the other hand, upon hearing that it was just a temporary appointment as a relief teacher, Lu De heaved a sigh of relief. This was an outcome that he could still tolerate. It was good that he didn\u2019t have to publicly refute the principal, or else he might just lose all of his hair out of stress.Seeing that there was no more opposition, Jiang Luofu nodded her head and said, \u201cThis matter is settled then. All of you should start returning to your classroom. Break time is already over, so none of you should be congregating here.\u201dUnder the direct order of the principal, the students swiftly dispersed.In comparison to Yuan Wendong and the others, who looked as if they had eaten shit, Chu Huanzhao was in a merry mood. Her excited expression showed that there were many words she wanted to say to Zu An, but under the stern watch of the teachers, she had no choice but to return to her classroom for the time being. Nevertheless, she still kept sneaking glances at Zu An while walking away.Pei Mianman also walked away silently amidst the crowd with her lips inconspicuously curved up. This lad actually managed to become a teacher of the academy. This is getting more and more interesting.Shang Liuyu summoned the students of the Yellow class back into the classroom and started on her foreign language class. As usual, the students were excited to attend her class. Waaa, Teacher Shang\u2019s class is so beautiful\u2026 interesting! I mean, interesting!Zu An also headed back into the classroom with his fellow classmates. It was not that he was lusting over Shang Liuyu\u2019s beauty, but he was honestly curious about how the languages of the other races in this world would be like. At the very least, this was much more interesting than the nonsensical law and etiquette classes he had thus far.Unexpectedly, Jiang Luofu stopped him and asked, \u201cHow is it? You didn\u2019t spend your 7,500,000 silver taels in vain, right?\u201d\u201cYes, indeed. It was worth every tael of it,\u201d replied Zu An with a fawning tone.Putting aside the humongous inflow of Rage points he had received earlier, it excited him just to imagine how all students of the academy would have to respectfully address him as \u2018Teacher Zu\u2019 in the future. Yup, I should try that on my honey next time and have her call me \u2018Teacher Zu\u2019 too.\u201cWhen you turned me down earlier, I thought that I didn\u2019t stand a chance anymore. Who could have thought that you would have follow-up arrangements.\u201dZu An was really tempted to dive forward and hug her thighs to express just how excited he was. However, he knew that it was more likely that he would just be scorned as a pervert if he were to do that, so he swiftly vanquished the thought.\u201cIt was indeed hopeless at the start. No matter how much money you give me, there\u2019s no way I could possibly have you appointed as a teacher. However, I couldn\u2019t have imagined that Yang Wei would challenge you to a bet and even make a claim to have you replace him if he loses. Since you have already proven your worth before the entire academy, that gave me an opportunity to push things along.\u201cEven though you aren\u2019t an official teacher yet in the system, you can be assured that you\u2019ll still be accorded the privileges of one. Later on, someone will lead you over to the staff\u2019s exclusive dormitory. If you need a place to rest, you can head there whenever you want to. Also, you\u2019ll also be paid monthly stipends too. Since you\u2019re a temporary teacher, you\u2019ll only be paid 80% of the usual wages. There\u2019s no problem with that, right?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Zu An was overjoyed.There\u2019s actually an exclusive staff dormitory! It looks like there\u2019s no need for me to get Cheng Shouping to buy a house outside anymore. Living in the academy is so much better\u2014there are youthful female students and gentle beautiful teachers here!\u201cSpeaking of which, now that you managed to get me appointed as a teacher, what about the dungeon slot we discussed earlier?\u201d Zu An suddenly remembered something vital.Jiang Luofu blinked her eyes contemplatively for a moment before a playful smile crept onto her lips. \u201cSince you\u2019re able to down even a teacher, I trust that a simple qualification examination shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you, right?\u201dWithout waiting for a response, she waved her hands and walked away, leaving behind a dumbfounded Zu An in her wake. What do you mean by it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for me? Wait, does that mean that she\u2019ll make arrangements for me, or does she intend for me to win the selections with my own strength?\u201cYou\u2019re close with Principal Jiang?\u201dIt was then that a pleasant voice sounded in Zu An\u2019s ears. Turning around, he realized that Shang Liuyu was standing right behind him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both of them ended up asking him the same question about one another. \u201cYou can say so. With my dashing appearance, it\u2019s inevitable that women would fall for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shang Liuyu.She sighed for a brief moment before offering him a piece of advice, \u201cYou best not say those words before our principal. She doesn\u2019t like people with slick tongues.\u201dZu An was surprised to hear that. But the gorgeous principal seems to like me quite a bit though. Is this because I\u2019m too charming? I\u2019ve long heard that the power of love allows one to overlook their partner\u2019s flaw.\u201cBig sister Shang, I\u2019m flattered by your concern,\u201d replied Zu An with a chuckle.Shang Liuyu harrumphed. \u201cI\u2019m only helping you since you played me a decent melody. However, I\u2019ve already repaid the favor, so don\u2019t expect me to help you anymore.\u201dShe thought that Zu An would be disappointed, but to her surprise, the latter\u2019s eyes lit up and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s simpler than I thought. I have plenty of melodies in here. I\u2019ll play you another one if an opportunity arises in the future.\u201dA rare tinge of excitement flushed Shang Liuyu\u2019s usual composed face. \u201cReally? You have more melodies of the same level as the one you played previously?\u201d\u201cOf course! Let\u2019s find a convenient night to bond over music, shall we? Where\u2019s your dormitory room? I also have a room in the staff\u2019s dormitory now. We might even be neighbors with one another!\u201d Zu An couldn\u2019t help but think about how his senior transmigrators had plagiarized all kinds of poems from their previous world to show off their \u2018literary talent\u2019.Since this world doesn\u2019t allow me to plagiarize poems, surely I should at least be able to plagiarize some melodies right? Pui, what am I even saying? It\u2019s called propagating the wondrous culture of the modern world. A noble act like this shouldn\u2019t even be called plagiarism!An enigmatic smile surfaced on Shang Liuyu\u2019s lips as she asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it perfectly fine to meet in the day? Why must we meet at night?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because we have lessons in the day. Right now, I\u2019m taking on the roles of a student and a teacher simultaneously, so I\u2019ll be busier than ever. I reckon that I\u2019ll only be free at night,\u201d replied Zu An earnestly. \u201cOther than exchanging melodies with one another, you can also help me with my studies. It has been a while since I came to the academy, but I realized that I haven\u2019t even attended any of your classes.\u201d\u201cHelp you with your studies?\u201d Shang Liuyu repeated with a bizarre look on her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it another time.\u201dOther students had started streaming out of the classroom. She didn\u2019t want to be seen too close to him in public, so she quickly bade her farewell and headed off.Looking at her beautiful departing silhouette, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but think that she was a little bipolar. She would be friendly at one moment, only to be distant in the next.The foreign language class ended quickly due to the earlier bet eating into the class. Next up was the cultivation class.Zu An was excited about this. He had been through all sorts of useless lessons the past few days, but he believed that none of them would be as practical as this. While he did have a convenient system that allowed him to level up through an alternative method, his lack of conventional cultivation knowledge made it hard for him to assess the threat of his opponents. Due to that, he had a strong desire to learn more about this subject.The cultivation teacher was Bai Susu. As soon as he walked in with his bum shaking seductively, the noisy classroom immediately settled down.This was not the class of some third-rank teacher. It was a true sixth rank expert standing right before them right now. Unless they were tired of living, it would wise not to act up before him.On top of that, Bai Susu\u2019s eerily seductive aura was a huge deterrence to the students; no one wanted to risk piquing his attention. If they were to be somehow called to the office for a private chat, they might just end up losing their first time.Bai Susu walked up to the podium and scanned the faces before him before his eyes finally stopped on Zu An. A smile emerged on his face as he said, \u201cI have been to this class many times now, but this is the first time I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. There\u2019s actually a colleague of mine seated here as well.\u201dThe surrounding students immediately directed looks of envy toward Zu An whereas the person-in-question simply responded with a shy smile. He was delighted to see yet another wave of Rage points coming in.Bai Susu cleared his throat and said, \u201cBefore I begin the class, let me make an important announcement first. The Ursae Dungeon is about to be opened, and while most of you are unlikely to stand a chance, you may still register for the selections if you\u2019re interested.\u201dThose words caused a stir in the classroom. The students began whispering amongst one another excitedly.Zu An was a little surprised to see that everyone actually knew about the Ursae Dungeon. It looks like I really need to brush up on my common knowledge. Yup, that\u2019s the perfect excuse to get Shang Liuyu to tutor me after school\u2026\u201cHm? The dungeon is opening up much earlier this year.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s half a year earlier than the usual time, right?\u201d\u2026Those who were more well-informed were surprised by the news.Bai Susu quickly explained, \u201cDungeons are existences that are shrouded in mystery to us. The conclusions we have made about them at the moment might not necessarily hold true, such as the opening times. However, there\u2019s indeed something peculiar about the premature opening of the dungeon this time around, so it\u2019s likely that it would be more dangerous than usual. Unless you have the capability, it\u2019ll be best for you not to covet what\u2019s inside the dungeon. Know that the academy will not be taking responsibility for your death.\u201d\u201cTeacher Bai, you\u2019re thinking too much. We have at least that much self-awareness.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Those who usually qualify to enter dungeons are always those from the Earth class or the Sky class. How could anyone from our Yellow class possibly qualify?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just here to watch the commotion.\u201d\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s good that you understand. Alright, let\u2019s start today\u2019s lesson. Even though most of you are likely to take on academic-related roles in the future, our Great Zhou Dynasty is, after all, founded on military might. There is some fundamental knowledge that you should still know about so that you won\u2019t disgrace yourself and our academy with your ignorance,\u201d said Bai Susu.\u201cI\u2019ve already imparted to you the basic cultivation technique. As for how far you can reach, that depends on your talent and fate. For today, I\u2019ll be teaching you some combat skills. While your cultivation technique allows you to strike harder and move faster than mortals, it\u2019s meaningless if you don\u2019t put your strength and speed to good use.\u201dThose words made Zu An\u2019s eyes light up. He could already sense the difference between the two of them when he fought with Snow back then. In his severely injured state, his strength and speed had already risen to a level comparable to Snow under the effects of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra.However, as soon as Snow used her combat skills, he was forced to a corner, unable to retaliate at all. It was similar to the differences between an ox and a tiger. In terms of absolute strength, an ox was likely to be stronger than a tiger, but it was always the latter hunting the former simply because the ox couldn\u2019t exert its strength effectively. Right now, Zu An was facing the same problem too.Thus, he immediately gathered his attention upon hearing that Bai Susu was going to impart to them combat skills.Bai Susu pushed the hems of his robe backward and pulled out a meter long sword. The students before him widened their eyes in astonishment. They were certain that Bai Susu didn\u2019t have a sword on him when he entered, so where did he conjure it from?There were some students who looked down to see if there was any way to feasibly hide such a big sword, but it simply didn\u2019t seem possibleHm, wait a moment. He can\u2019t possibly be hiding it there, can he?A flicker of excitement flashed across Bai Susu\u2019s fair face as he said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be imparting to you the Thirteen Forms of Elementary Swordplay.\u201dZu An nearly spurted blood upon hearing those words. He had read plenty of novels in his previous life, and all of them had awe-inspiring names for their techniques. He thought that given how lofty Brightmoon Academy was, it should have some secret arts on the level of Dugu Nine Swords or Six Pulse Divine Sword.Yet, it turned out to be such a humble name. \u2018Elementary Swordplay\u2019, this name reeked of weakness!There were many students who shared the same thoughts as him, and they began booing.Bai Susu seemed to have expected such a reaction. He waited for the students to calm down before he started explaining, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on the Thirteen Forms of Elementary Swordplay. You should know that these Thirteen Forms are the foundation of all swordsmanship. All of those mystical and amazing swordplays you see are basically an extension of the Thirteen Forms.\u201cThe Thirteen Forms have been continuously refined over the centuries to maximize their prowess. Its aim is to bring down your enemy using the fastest speed in the shortest distance. Most powerful experts in the world eventually come to a point where they return back to the bare basics, and their movements are more or less similar to the Thirteen Forms.\u201dThe students were placated by those words, and they began earnestly listening to Bai Susu once more.Bai Susu nodded his head in satisfaction. He raised his sword up high and began lecturing, \u201cThe Thirteen Forms are namely \u2018Stab, Chop, Tap, Swing, Pick, Flick, Intercept, Sweep, Slit, Shed, Cloud, Revolve, and Rise\u2019. All of them are simple and direct to the point, nothing fancy about them at all. However, even though they look simple enough, it\u2019s not easy to master them. I\u2019ll demonstrate the Thirteen Forms once for you before slowly imparting them one by one in the subsequent lessons.\u201dFollowing that, Bai Susu\u2019s disposition suddenly changed. His air of femininity faded as the sword in his hand morphed into a cold burst of light, causing the students in the classroom to shudder.Watching the swordplay on the podium, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but recall a poem.Once there was a fair lady by the name of Gongsun, a great commotion she would stir when she danced with her swords.Mountains are shamed by the crowds she draws, even heaven and earth would sway with her grace.Her blade glimmers as bright as the nine suns Hou Yi downed, her moves swift like the dragon chariots of the heavenly gods.With thunderous fury she commences her dance, but with the tranquility of the reflected moon in the sea it concludes.\u2026Haaa, what a pity that he\u2019s a guy. What a waste of his beautiful appearance, or else it would be a truly marvelous sight.The Thirteen Forms soon fully demonstrated. Seeing the awed looks of the students around, Bai Susu asked with a smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t it formidable?\u201d\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cThe Elementary Swordplay actually wields such great prowess!\u201d\u201cI think it looks suave too. Girls will surely fall for me if I can master this!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Teacher Bai has a beautiful appearance. Just look at your own face\u2026 Tsk tsk tsk.\u201d\u2026Bai Susu took out a little mirror to check if his hair was disheveled before continuing on with the lecture, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve shared with you the strengths of this swordplay, so naturally, I should also talk about its weaknesses lest you lot attempt to do something rash with it.\u201cMy swordplay might have looked formidable, but in truth, it\u2019s because my cultivation is higher than you. Strength and speed are necessary to bring out the prowess of this swordplay to its maximum potential. If your cultivation is not high level, executing this swordplay will reveal all sorts of openings. The crux of this swordplay lay in its powerful offensive prowess, resulting in its lacking defense in comparison.\u201cHowever, you need no worry. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll clash with powerful cultivators in the future. You should find this swordplay sufficient to deal with common thieves and bandits.\u201d\u201cTsk~\u201dUpon hearing the weaknesses of the swordplay, the excited crowd found their motivation dampening significantly. I should have known. Any combat skills that are imparted to our Yellow class are bound to be nothing special.However, Zu An was moved by Bai Susu\u2019s description of the swordplay. He found that its weakness didn\u2019t apply to him since he had no lack of strength and speed. In fact, if he could synergize Grandgale\u2019s instantaneous movement together with this swordplay, wouldn\u2019t he be able to exert an incredible amount of forceHe thought about the Bixie Swordplay in the Smiling, Proud Wanderer, a wuxia drama series he had watched in his previous life. It was straightforward and focused mainly on offense. In the eyes of true experts, it was filled with openings. However, if it were to be used in unison with a powerful movement technique, the swordsmanship would become nigh impossible to curb.As long as you\u2019re fast enough, openings are not openings anymore. You\u2019d be able to release your prowess to the greatest degree.The more Zu An thought about it, the more excited he was. However, he soon realized something. He lowered his head to look at \u2018little Zu An\u2019, and tears began brimming in his eyes.Is it destiny?1. Bixie Swordplay is infamous in the Wuxia community as a skill that requires one to castrate himself in order to learn, which is similar to Zu An\u2019s plightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, this concerned his survival. If he could pick up a powerful combat skill, he would have yet another means to deal with his enemies.He earnestly listened to Bai Susu decipher every single form. Even Wei Suo\u2019s several calls to engage him in a conversation couldn\u2019t break his concentration, which left Wei Suo feeling rather frustrated. Bro, you\u2019re in the wrong class. We, of the Yellow class, don\u2019t focus on cultivation.After class, Zu An went through everything he had learned earlier when a staff suddenly called him out, \u201cZu\u2026 Teacher Zu, your dormitory is ready. Would you like to head over to take a look?\u201dIt was inevitable that the staff would feel awkward addressing Zu An as a teacher. It was just moments ago that he was still a student, but who could have thought that he would climb up the ladder so quickly?\u201cIt\u2019s you? What a coincidence!\u201d remarked Zu An. It turned out to be the staff who led him to the Principal\u2019s Office when he first arrived at the academy.\u201cIt sure is,\u201d replied the staff with a polite smile. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll familiarize you with the area.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Zu An nodded. It was the afternoon break anyway, and there was plenty of time for him to take a look at his dormitory before the afternoon classes.\u201cHow do I address you?\u201d Zu An asked. It was their second time meeting, so it would be good if they could at least acquaint themselves with one another.\u201cI am Zhu Gan. I\u2019m in charge of the logistics affairs of the academy,\u201d replied the staff.\u201cZhu Gan? You have quite an imposing name. To live a carefree life and screw with anyone who stands in your way,\u201d remarked Zu An.The staff\u2019s face darkened. Clearly, this was not the first time someone had misunderstood his name. He quickly clarified, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that Gan (\u5e72). It\u2019s the Gan (\u6de6) with three droplets and \u2018Gold (\u91d1)\u2019 character.\u201dThe atmosphere suddenly turned awkward. Zu An tried to laugh it off as he remarked, \u201cThat sounds equally great too. Haha, hahaha~\u201dZhu Gan looked less than impressed though. Bro, I can\u2019t feel any sincerity from your compliment.It didn\u2019t take long for the two of them to reach a rather tranquil \u2018villa area\u2019\u2014at least that was how it looked to Zu An. It was near a serene forest, but the colorful grass along the road was trimmed neatly. Every now and then, they would see an independent villa vaguely visible amidst the trees. It really looked like those high-class residential areas he had seen on the TV in his previous life.\u201cTeacher Zu, this is your residence. This token over here is the key, and your information is already imprinted on it. The formation around the residence will automatically identify you,\u201d said Zhu Gan as he passed a translucent jade token over.Zu An examined the token, and he couldn\u2019t help but marvel that it really looked like something that had come out of a fantasy movie. It looked much more classy than the hotel keys he had seen in his previous life. \u201cCan I use this to open the doors of the other residences?\u201dZhu Gan was rendered speechless by that question. Are you an idiot? Even a person thinking with his bum will be able to tell you that it\u2019s impossible.However, recalling how Zu An had an overwhelming tendency to get into trouble, he still decided to remind him just in case. \u201cOf course not. If the formation senses that someone is trying to trespass on the residence, it\u2019ll automatically attack the trespasser. You shouldn\u2019t mess around with the residences of other teachers.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Zu An was a little disappointed. \u201cThen, where\u2019s Teacher Shang Liuyu\u2019s residence? Is it neighboring mine?\u201d\u201cDream on!\u201d Zhu Gan finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. One must know that Shang Liuyu was the dream lover of many male teachers in the academy, including him. \u201cTeacher Shang\u2019s residence is located in another area. You won\u2019t find it here.\u201dZu An was really impressed by just how needlessly rich academies in this world were. To think that every teacher would be allocated with an independent residence! The dormitories in my previous world are so much better. Everyone lives harmoniously in the same cluster of buildings. Who knows? Maybe a babe might just live next door!Zhu Gan continued relaying some information before taking his leave. He was afraid that he would cave in to his desire and give this fellow a good pummeling. He simply couldn\u2019t stand how smug Zu An was acting.Meanwhile, Zu An began to explore his own residence. It was similar to a courtyard house, not too big but sufficient. There wasn\u2019t any particularly elegant furniture inside, but most necessities were provided. Overall, it was pretty amazing for free lodging.It looks like teachers in this world are treated really well. I guess I can spare myself from having to waste my money on buying a residence in the city. Hmph, if the Chu clan angers me again, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll run here to seek refuge!I wonder if the academy allows me to buy and bring some beautiful maids in\u2026All of a sudden, he heard a gentle voice coming from the entrance. \u201cTeacher Zu, are you inside?\u201dZu An was surprised. Was my willpower so great that the world felt compelled to send a beautiful maid my way? Or does the academy actually assign a beautiful maid to every teacher? This voice sounds a little familiar though\u2026He rushed to the doorway, only to see a traditional beauty standing by the doorway. She looked at him with a pair of tender almond-shaped eyes.\u201cYou are\u2026 Zheng Dan?\u201d Zu An blinked his eyes.Is my luck with romance that strong? To actually be called \u2018teacher\u2019 by a beautiful woman like her\u2026 Ahhh, it really feels good!I should have gotten others from the academy over to take a good look. See how this young lady is willingly calling me teacher with that sweet voice of hers. Watch and learn, alright?The beautiful woman smiled sweetly as she replied, \u201cTeacher Zu sure has an amazing memory. I didn\u2019t think that you would still remember me.\u201dZu An couldn\u2019t help retort mentally. I just saw you this morning though. I\u2019d have to be senile to actually forget you this quickly.\u201cMay I know what business does Miss Zheng has with me?\u201d Zu An remembered the warning that Chu Huanzhao gave him earlier in the morning, so he didn\u2019t let the other party\u2019s beauty get the better of him.\u201cI was in too much of a rush earlier this morning, so I wasn\u2019t able to properly thank you for saving my life.\u201d Zheng Dan raised her hands and shook the lunch box in her hands. \u201cIt happens to be lunchtime, and I had a feeling that you haven\u2019t had your meal yet. So, I personally cooked a few dishes and brought them here. I hope that you can enjoy them.\u201d\u201cYou cooked personally?\u201d Zu An frowned with a weird look on his face. \u201cMiss Zheng, you didn\u2019t attend the classes this morning?\u201dAre you insulting my intelligence over here? I saw you at the entrance just this morning. How could you possibly have the chance to return home to cook?The meticulous Zheng Dan was able to swiftly guess what he was thinking. She calmly explained, \u201cMy family has prepared a residence for me in the academy too. I prepared the food over there.\u201d\u201cHm? Students can also own a residence in the academy too?\u201dZheng Dan chuckled under her hand as she replied, \u201cMost people won\u2019t be able to, but our Zheng clan has quite a bit of influence in Brightmoon City. So, we\u2019re able to get a bit of leeway on this.\u201dZu An came to a realization. Most likely, aside from Zheng Dan, most of those notable young masters and young misses all had their own residences in the academy too.Pui! I thought that the academy is a sacred place for learning, but it turns out that its purity has been marred by greed too!\u201cTeacher Zu, may we continue the conversation in your residence? If anyone passing by were to see this, it might lead to some negative rumors.\u201d Zheng Dan looked at Zu An with eyes so pitiful that it could melt the hearts of all men.Zu An was just a mortal man, so he wasn\u2019t an exception to the norm either. He stood aside to let her in while remarking teasingly, \u201cAre you worried that your reputation will be sullied if this matter were to get to General Sang?\u201dZheng Dan remarked with a sigh, \u201cIt seems like Teacher Zu knows about my engagement. Haa, there\u2019s nothing I can do. In large clans like ours, we don\u2019t have the freedom to decide on our partners.\u201dZu An was impressed with Zheng Dan\u2019s ability with words. She was able to express her helplessness in being forced into the marriage without making a negative remark about Sang Hong. It looked as if she was making a point, but in truth, she actually hadn\u2019t said anything much at all.Even if others were to hear about it, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal at all.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about such stuff. I\u2019m here today to thank you for your help.\u201d Zheng Dan looked at Zu An with gleaming, large eyes. She looked even more ravishing close-up.Even with all of the beauties around him, Zu An had to admit that the woman before him was incredibly good-looking. It was no wonder why she was in the Sweetheart Ranking.It was then that Zheng Dan suddenly took out plates packed inside a wooden bo and began laying them on the table. She was neither too fast nor too small, and her movements were incredibly elegant. Zu An couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of those valiant Jiangnan women dressed in qipao he had seen on the television in his previous life.Soon, the table was filled with plates of side dishes, and every single one of them looked appetizing. It was going to be a delightful feast.Zheng Dan was particularly proud of this. Her skill set wasn\u2019t just limited to brewing tea; in fact, her specialty lay in cooking. She was confident in her own culinary skill, though she hardly had any time to cook. It was only her interest that compelled her to continue squeezing out time to invest in this hobby. Not even Sang Qian had the opportunity to enjoy her cooking yet.She waited quietly for Zu An to praise her cooking so that she could respond with words of humility. She had already scripted out the scenario in her head. Having played a persona of the perfect young miss of an illustrious clan for so many years, it was almost second nature to her by now.\u201cOh, your lunchbox actually retains heat!\u201d Zu An exclaimed as he picked up the wooden box and examined it closely.Zheng Dan nearly choked on her saliva. She couldn\u2019t understand just what Zu An was up to talking about such meaningless things. Nevertheless, she still responded with a light smile, \u201cThe wooden box is inscribed with a formation that retains warmth. It isn\u2019t anything special.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Zu An nodded.He realized that he really mustn\u2019t underestimate this world. While it was lagging behind in terms of technological development, they were still able to achieve many things through formations, be it the anti-jerking runes on Chu Chuyan\u2019s carriage or the ki isolation runes on the dice shakers. He remembered the Chu clan mentioning something about inscribing runes on weapons too. It looked like he should brush up on his knowledge regarding this in the future.Meanwhile, Zheng Dan suddenly realized what was going on too.Just a month ago, this fellow was still a hoodlum idling his life away. It\u2019s only after becoming the drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan that he\u2019s able to come into contact with all of these, so it\u2019s inevitable that he\u2019s still quite ignorant about the items common to affluent clans. Well, a canary can\u2019t evolve into a phoenix just because it has flown to a higher branch.Despite being filled with scorn toward Zu An, her smile still remained impeccable. \u201cTeacher Zu, please have a seat. The food won\u2019t taste as nice once they cool down. Here, I\u2019ll pour you a cup of wine.\u201d\u201cA cup of wine?\u201d Glancing at Zheng Dan\u2019s fair wrists peeking out from her sleeves as she poured out a cup of wine, Zu An remarked deeply, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that alcohol tends to erode one\u2019s rationality?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cErosion of rationality\u2026\u201d Zheng Dan was rendered speechless.Why doesn\u2019t this fellow go with the flow? Other men would surely try their best to showcase their gentlemanly side, but this guy is acting as if he was afraid that others wouldn\u2019t know about his perversion!That being said, Zheng Dan still reacted fairly quickly. She put on a natural smile and replied, \u201cTeacher Zu is a gentleman; you aren\u2019t like any other men. You\u2019ve saved my life, so there\u2019s no way I would think of you in such a light.\u201dShe felt queasy just to say those words. No matter which angle one looked at Zu An from, it was simply impossible to associate the word \u2018gentleman\u2019 with him.\u201cOh? I never knew I had such a noble side to me.\u201d Zu An touched his face delightedly, pleased with Zheng Dan\u2019s words.\u201cAllow me to propose a toast to Teacher Zu for saving my life.\u201d Zheng Dan raised her wine cup as she looked at him with a gentle smile.On the other hand, Zu An hesitated at this point. Based on what Chu Huanzhao said, the Sang clan wasn\u2019t on good terms with the Chu clan. Considering that the Zheng clan were going to be in-laws with the Sang clan, it should be safe to assume that they were on the same front.If so, Zheng Dan\u2019s purpose for approaching him was worth questioning. As narcissistic as Zu An was, he wasn\u2019t utterly blind.\u201cYou didn\u2019t poison this wine, did you?\u201d He had been assassinated multiple times ever since coming to this world, making him wary about everything. He decided to simply ask it outright since it was in line with his character anyway.Zheng Dan replied with a smile, \u201cTeacher Zu, you\u2019re jesting with me. You\u2019re a teacher of the academy, as well as my benefactor. How could I possibly dare to poison your wine? If you\u2019re still worried, I can take a sip first.\u201dAs she said those words, she lifted his cup and took a light sip before returning it back to him.Looking at the slight lip imprint on the cup, Zu An narrowed his eyes.She really is dropping a lot of hints here. This is obviously a beauty trap. But what is she aiming for? Does she want intelligence on the Chu clan from me? Or does she simply want to snatch me away from Chu Chuyan so that she can satisfy her sense of superiority?After contemplating this question for a long time, his final conclusion was that he was simply too good-looking and that the other party simply lusted over his body. Yeap, that must be the case.So, Zu An lifted his wine cup with a smile and said, \u201cMiss Zheng, you\u2019re jesting. How could I possibly suspect you of drugging the wine? Here, let\u2019s have a drink.\u201dZheng Dan rolled her eyes. You just said it out loud earlier. You sure are refreshingly shameless, huh?In order to be safe, Zu An chose to eat the dishes which Zheng Dan had taken a bite of, but as soon as he got a taste, his eyes widened in wonderment. \u201cMiss Zheng, your culinary skills are really top-notch! I\u2019ve never eaten anything as delicious as this before!\u201dHe had never eaten food as good as this before in his entire two lives. His previous world was indeed filled with delicacies, but as a keyboard warrior, how could he possibly have the time and money to grab anything good?\u201cTeacher Zu, you\u2019re too humble. How could my culinary skills be a match for Chu First Miss?\u201d replied Zheng Dan.Zu An was aware that Zheng Dan was intentionally trying to stir conflict between the two of them, but he still went along with her anyway. \u201cMy wife? Hah, does she even know how to cook?\u201dAfter making the remark, he grabbed the wine cup and downed the alcohol.The edges of Zheng Dan\u2019s mouth curved up with a hint of glee. She knew that her plan was working. Hmph, it\u2019s all because she\u2019s the First Miss of a ducal estate that she\u2019s able to one-up me for everything. Otherwise, how could she possibly be a match for me?\u201cWith Miss Zheng\u2019s culinary skills, anyone who marries you will truly be blessed for life,\u201d remarked Zu An.Zheng Dan replied with a smile, \u201cIf Teacher Zu is fond of my cooking, I\u2019m more than happy to cook for you every day.\u201dZu An was a little taken aback by that remark. Aren\u2019t you getting a little too straightforward here? It looks like you\u2019re quite an expert at playing romance, huh? Such words could easily stir the hearts of any man.\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly do it for a lifetime. General Sang is going to get jealous,\u201d replied Zu An.Zheng Dan nodded. \u201cIt\u2019d indeed be inconvenient for me to continue cooking for you after my marriage. However, you can always drop by our estate whenever you\u2019re having a craving. With your knowledge, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019d be able to become good friends with Sang Qian.Zu An was impressed. This woman has been dropping hints, trying to seduce me, but so far, she has been making sure to toe within the line so as to not get overboard. By mentioning her engagement with the Sang clan right now, she makes herself look like a gentle and virtuous wife. This further stirs a man\u2019s desire to conquer.Zheng Dan understood that the key to romance wasn\u2019t just charging ahead blindly; it was about keeping an appropriate distance and slowly hooking the other party in. So, she chose to change the topic. \u201cTeacher Zu, I have some doubts about one of the questions you came up with during your competition with Teacher Yang. May I ask you to explain it to me once more?\u201d\u201cYou want me to explain it to you?\u201d Zu An had a bizarre look on his face. A female student having one-to-one remedial lessons at her teacher\u2019s house\u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve seen this plotline in adult films before.\u201cI know that it\u2019s a little brash of me to make a request of you all of a sudden, but I\u2019m quite interested in arithmetic as well. Whenever there\u2019s a question that I\u2019m unable to make sense of, it\u2019d continue to linger in my mind for days. So, I can only trouble you on this.\u201d Blinking her large eyes, Zheng Dan looked as innocent as she could get.Interested in arithmetic? Wow, I\u2019ve never heard anything more bullshit than that. I\u2019d really feel bad exposing you if you're going to such an extent.Despite his mental retorts, Zu An still kept an amiable expression on his face as he said, \u201cWhich question are you having difficulties with?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the one about the red eyes and blue eyes. Why would all of five prisoners with red eyes commit suicide on the fifth day?\u201d asked Zheng Dan.Zu began to explain the question, \u201cThis question can be solved using inductive reasoning. Assuming that there\u2019s only one red-eyed prisoner, he would see that everyone else around him has blue eyes, and through that, he would be able to confirm that the person with red eyes is him. As a result, he would commit suicide on the first night. That\u2019s straightforward enough.\u201cMoving on, assuming that there are 2 red-eyed prisoners\u2026\u201cOn the very first day, the red-eyed prisoners will see 1 red-eyed prisoner and 98 blue-eyed prisoners whereas the blue-eyed prisoners will see 2 red-eyed prisoners and 97 blue-eyed prisoners. At this point, no one can confirm whether they have red eyes or not, so no one commits suicide on the first night.\u201cHowever, this, in turn, tells everyone that there\u2019s more than 1 red-eyed prisoner amongst them. So, on the second day, the red-eyed prisoners, who see 1 red-eyed prisoner and 98 blue-eyed prisoners from their perspective, would know that they have red eyes too and commit suicide. On the other hand, the blue-eyed prisoners who see 2 red-eyed prisoners and 97 blue-eyed prisoners are still unable to confirm whether they have red eyes or not, so they don\u2019t make a move. As a result, the 2 red-eyed prisoners commit suicide on the second day.\u201cThe same logic applies when there are 3 red-eyed prisoners too.\u201cOn the first day, the red-eyed prisoners see 2 red-eyed prisoners and 97 blue-eyed prisoners whereas the blue-eyed prisoners see 3 red-eyed prisoners and 96 blue-eyed prisoners. No one is able to confirm if they have red eyes, so no one dies the first night.\u201cOn the second day, everyone knows that there is more than 1 red-eyed prisoner. The red-eyed prisoners see 2 red-eyed prisoners and are unable to confirm if they have red eyes, and the same goes for the blue-eyed prisoners too. So, no one dies on the second night.\u201cOn the third day, everyone knows that there are more than 2 red-eyed prisoners. The red-eyed prisoners, who only see 2 red-eyed prisoners, realize that they themselves have red eyes too whereas the blue-eyed prisoners, who see 3 red-eyed prisoners, are still unable to confirm if they have red eyes. As a result, the 3 red-eyed prisoners commit suicide on the third day.\u201cSo, building on this reasoning we have developed, if there are 5 red-eyed prisoners, all five of them would realize that they have red eyes on the fifth day and commit suicided together.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201d Zheng Dan clapped her hands in realization. \u201cI thought that the question was really tough, but now that you\u2019ve explained it, it all makes sense now. You\u2019re truly amazing!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re flattering me~\u201d Zu An waved his hands humbly. Your compliment is quite fake, but I\u2019ll take it.Through creating a common topic between the two of them, the conversation flowed smoothly from thereon. The slight awkwardness in the air gradually dissipated as the two of them became more comfortable with one another. In the midst of their conversation, Zheng Dan stood up to refill Zu An\u2019s wine cup, but she accidentally knocked the chopsticks onto the floor.\u201cAh!\u201d exclaimed Zheng Dan.She quickly bent down to pick the chopsticks up.Zu An was about to reach out to pick it up for her, only for his eyes to widen in the next moment. Due to her bending down, the fabric around her collar ended up hanging a little loosely, vaguely revealing a pair of enticing snowy ridges.At the same time, her robe also slipped downward slightly, exposing her fair shoulders partially.\u201cThis woman must be doing it on purpose!\u201d Zu An gulped down his saliva.You want to use your beauty to deal with me? Hah! You must not know that I\u2019m very vulnerable to people like you!Zheng Dan\u2019s face also couldn\u2019t help but redden a little. Such nifty tricks came naturally to her, but nevertheless, this was still the first time she was using it on a man. It was inevitable that she would feel embarrassed about it.After this brief event, the two of them continued chatting for a while before Zheng Dan finally stood up and took her leave.Zu An stood up as well and said, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher Zu.\u201d Zheng Dan nodded in response. She flicked her wrist lightly, and her skirt immediately slipped right underneath Zu An\u2019s feet. Then, she lurched forward.Tzla~The crisp sound of fabric tearing echoed loudly in the air as Zheng Dan crashed right to the ground. Half of her skirt was torn off, revealing her smooth legs. Flustered by the occurrence, she desperately tried to cover herself, but how could a pair of hands be able to cover a pair of legs?Her timid reaction made her even more alluring. Any man standing in her presence would surely feel duty-bound to protect her.However, Zu An simply blinked his eyes quietly at the beautiful pair of legs before him.Does this woman think that I didn\u2019t see her flicking her own skirt under my feet? I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s up to, but she really is going all out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d Zu An belatedly panicked and rushed forward to help her up. He decided to go along with her act to see what she was up to. Since you want to put on a play, it would be rude of me not to play along with you, right?Zheng Dan bit her lips in distress before harrumphing with a coy tone. \u201cTeacher Zu, you sure are mean. You tore my skirt.\u201dHer coy tone was fatal. Despite knowing that she was putting on an act, Zu An still felt his heart thumping furiously. He finally understood that the most formidable person in Journey to the West wasn\u2019t Sun Wukong but Tripitaka. He was able to stay true to himself even under the seduction of so many temptresses along the way; he was a formidable man.\u201cI apologize for my misstep. Come, allow me to help you up.\u201d Zu An reached out to support her.\u201cOuch!\u201d Zheng Dan yelped in pain. Tears brimmed in her reddened eyes. \u201cI-I think I sprained my ankle.\u201dZu An was impressed. What a waste it is that she isn\u2019t an actress. Otherwise, she would have surely won an Oscars. It\u2019s one thing to do a tripping scene, but she even sprained her leg as well?\u201cTeacher Zu, can you help me take a look?\u201d Zheng Dan stared at Zu An with eyes glistening with tears. It was hard not to feel pity for her.So, Zu An squatted down beside her and gently grabbed her legs. It felt velvety on touch. \u201cIs it here?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s a bit higher.\u201d Zheng Dan bit her lips tightly. Her cheeks were tinted with a light blush, giving her a seductive vibe yet still retaining the innocence and shyness a young girl should have.\u201cIs it here?\u201d Zu An slowly moved his hands up her ankles. Her legs were really small, allowing him to wrap his hands around them nicely. Its warm and soft texture was enough to send any men bonkers.\u201cNo, not there\u2026 A little higher, a little higher.\u201d Zheng Dan\u2019s face reddened. All of a sudden, she found herself regretting her decision. She wondered if she was allowing him to take such a big advantage of her. Forget it. I\u2019ll teach this fellow a lesson once I obtain the debt note!Zu An was amused. Since you want to want to honey trap me, it\u2019d be too rude of me to turn you down, right? With such thoughts in mind, his hands slowly crept up her smooth skin.Zu An\u2019s rough and hot palm left Zheng Dan\u2019s heart beating frenziedly. It was a sensation that she had never experienced before, and it made her realize that she was playing with fire here. So, she quickly grabbed his hand to stop him from moving any higher. Then, she moved on to hug him, saying, \u201cBig brother Zu, I suddenly feel really cold.\u201dZu An gulped down his saliva as he replied, \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling hot.\u201dA gleeful smile crept onto Zheng Dan\u2019s lips. Even with a wife as beautiful as Chu Chuyan, he\u2019s still unable to resist my charms.\u201cBig brother Zu, can you hug me tight? I\u2019m feeling really cold,\u201d said Zheng Dan pitifully as her hands quickly fumbled around his robe.She took careful note of her action to make it seem as if her hands were teasing him, making it hard to tell that she was actually searching for something.\u201cHm? Why is it not here?\u201dShe had done a quick search of his body earlier this body, but she couldn\u2019t find the debt note. So, she intentionally planned this scheme to get more intimate with him this time around, yet she still couldn\u2019t find anything at all.Where in the world is this fellow hiding the debt note?Zheng Dan suddenly shot a look between Zu An\u2019s legs. Could he be hiding it in his pants?Zu An, on the other hand, felt his mouth turning dry. This woman\u2019s ability to seduce sure is incredible. Even a slight touch from her is enough to stoke one\u2019s desire.However, as she slowly moved her hand downward, Zu An immediately snapped out of it. He was reminded of a pitiful reality\u2014\u2019little Zu An\u2019 was still sealed off!Despite such a beauty leaping into his embrace, he had no choice but to watch on.\u201cWho in the world planted such a seal on me? Goddamnit!\u201d Zu An was on the verge of tears. He dared not let her continue touching him, or else if she were to notice that he wasn\u2019t \u2018reacting\u2019 at all, his dysfunction would be exposed right away!He dared not imagine what would happen if everyone in the city looked at him with eyes filled with scorn.As a man, he couldn\u2019t allow that to happen!So, he quickly pushed the woman in her embrace away and hurriedly backed off. \u201cThat\u2026 Miss Zheng, you should rest here for a while. I\u2019ll get a physician over to check on you!\u201dWatching as Zu An fled in a fluster, Zheng Dan was stunned for a moment before she suddenly burst out laughing. At the same time, a conflicted look surfaced in her eyes. Everyone said that Zu An was a perverted good-for-nothing, but who could have thought that he would actually be so gentlemanly? On top of that, he also won 7,500,000 silver taels from the casino and defeated a teacher in a duel.Just which one is the real you?The more Zheng Dan thought about it, the more curious she was. However, she hadn\u2019t forgotten her goal here yet. She got up and checked that Zu An was really gone before she closed the door and began searching the room.However, no matter how she looked, the debt note was nowhere to be found. A frown formed on her forehead as she murmured, \u201cJust where did that fellow hide the debt note?\u201dSince the debt note wasn\u2019t in the residence, she decided to leave for the time being. She couldn\u2019t possibly wait for Zu An to return with the physician\u2014if so, her lies about being ill would be exposed. On top of that, if rumors were to spread that she had visited another man\u2019s room alone, it would sully her reputation.She didn\u2019t mind seducing Zu An privately, but she didn\u2019t want anyone else to know about the matter.On the other hand, Zu An ran all the way into the forest and hid up. Naturally, he knew that Zheng Dan was faking illness, so he wouldn\u2019t be so foolish as to get a physician over. He waited until she was gone before heaving a sigh of relief.It looks like I need to find the Evanescent Lotus as soon as possible. I can\u2019t allow something like this to happen a third time!Just thinking about that incident between him and Snow made him look up into the sky wistfully and quietly tear up.Anyway, he returned back to his residence and double-checked that nothing was missing before he locked his door and trudged his way back to the classroom languidly.His mood remained low for the rest of the day, and soon, it was the end of school.\u201cBrother-in-law, brother-in-law~\u201dWhile Zu An was trudging out of the classroom, he suddenly heard an energetic voice calling for him. When he turned around to take a look, he saw Chu Huanzhao waving at him happily.\u201cMy sister-in-law is still the best of all.\u201dZu An felt warmth in his heart. However, he swiftly remembered the seal on his body, and he grew depressed once more.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why do you look so downcast?\u201d Chu Huanzhao was still skipping her way over to talk to Zu An when she noticed his anomaly.\u201cNothing much. I just want some quiet time to myself. Life has been too hard recently.\u201d Zu An sighed deeply. The gloomy atmosphere he exuded was almost tangible.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You defeated Yang Wei and was appointed by Principal Jiang as the new arithmetic teacher. Shouldn\u2019t you be happy about it?\u201d asked Chu Huanzhao uncomprehendingly.\u201cI\u2019m just a relief teacher. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve been officially hired,\u201d remarked Zu An disconsolately.\u201cA relief teacher is still a teacher. If my father were to learn about it, he\u2019d surely see you in a new light!\u201d Just imagining the sight made Chu Huanzhao tingle in excitement. \u201cAlso, if my older sister learns that you became her teacher, I reckon that she would surely reveal an interesting expression. In the future, when you hold lessons in the Sky class, you should make sure to pick her to answer your questions. She always acts as if she\u2019s the best; I\u2019d really want to see her getting embarrassed at least once.\u201dThe scenarios painted by Chu Huanzhao lit up Zu An\u2019s gloomy mind, especially the thought of having Chu Chuyan call him \u2018Teacher Zu\u2019 in public. It would surely be an interesting sight.\u201cSpeaking of which, where did you go earlier in the afternoon? I came over to ask you out for lunch, but I couldn\u2019t find you anywhere.\u201d Chu Huanzhao sounded a little sullen. \u201cConfess it. Were you hooking up with some girl?\u201d\u201cHow can that possibly be? One of the academy staff brought me to take a look at the teacher\u2019s dormitory.\u201d Zu An was shocked by how sharp Chu Huanzhao\u2019s sixth sense was.\u201cTeacher\u2019s dormitory?\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOooooh! Give me the key!\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Zu An had intended to show off his dormitory in the first place, so he didn\u2019t hesitate to pass the key over.\u201cWaaaa, it really is the key to the academy\u2019s residences!\u201d Chu Huanzhao examined the key in her hands fondly. A moment later, she explained, \u201cTo be frank with you, I have always wanted a residence in the academy. However, my father and mother are very strict with me, and they say that it\u2019s a waste of money. Hmph! Even Zheng Dan has a residence, so why do I, a daughter of a ducal clan, not have one?\u201dZu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat upon hearing Zheng Dan\u2019s name. He quickly tried to divert the topic away, \u201cIf you want, you can drop by whenever you want to.\u201d\u201cSounds great!\u201d Chu Huanzhao slipped the key into her pocket. \u201cThat\u2019ll be my new afternoon nap spot then. Ahhhh, it sure is great to have your own residence. You can lie down however you want to. Sleeping on the classroom desk is quite uncomfortable, tsk tsk tsk.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re intending to have afternoon naps over at my place?\u201d Zu An nearly spurted blood. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s convenient.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s inconvenient about that?\u201d Chu Huanzhao eyed Zu An in suspicion. \u201cYou can\u2019t be hiding a vixen there, are you?\u201d\u201cNo no, of course not!\u201d Zu An\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He quickly clarified, \u201cI mean, we are of the opposite gender after all. I think there\u2019s a need to keep some distance between us\u2026\u201dChu Huanzhao\u2019s face immediately turned red. \u201cBrother-in-law, what are you thinking in your head! It\u2019s not like I\u2019m planning to share a room with you in the residence!\u201dZu An belatedly realized that he had forgotten to check out the layout of the residence due to Zheng Dan\u2019s sudden arrival. Now that he thought about it, there were indeed several bedrooms. Putting aside two people, it could even house an entire family there!To alleviate the sudden awkwardness, he quickly spoke on, \u201cCome by if you want to, but at least return me my key. How am I supposed to enter my residence without it?\u201d\u201cNo can do!\u201d replied Chu Huanzhao firmly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird for me to have to look for you in order to have my afternoon nap? If I have a key with me, I can head over whenever I want to. You can just apply for a spare key with the academy\u2019s logistics later on.\u201d\u201cAh? It\u2019s possible to duplicate the key?\u201d Zu An was surprised to hear that. Due to the influences from the novels he had read in his previous life, he had imagined the key to be one-of-a-kind\u201cOf course it can be duplicated!\u201d exclaimed Chu Huanzhao. \u201cYou keep turning me down for some reason. You can\u2019t really be intending to hide a vixen in your residence, are you?\u201dShe leaned toward him and began sniffing his body. Then, her face immediately warped in shock. \u201cWoah woah woah, I smell the scent of another woman on you! Wait a minute, why does this fragrance sound so familiar? Isn\u2019t it the one Zheng Dan uses?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is she a dog? How in the world is she able to sniff people out through their smell?Unable to believe it, he lifted his sleeves and tried smelling himself, but all he could smell was a faint fragrance. Don't all women pretty much use the same fragrances? I can\u2019t tell the difference at all.Chu Huanzhao unhesitatingly reached out to grab his ear. \u201cSpeak! What did you do with Zheng Dan? Did you do something that let me\u2026 I mean, my older sister down!\u201d\u201cLet go, let go!\u201d It was so painful that it nearly squeezed tears out of Zu An\u2019s eyes. He thought that his sister-in-law was slowly becoming gentler and amicable, but it turned out that she was still a tyrannosaurus rex at heart. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything at all! This smell is probably from this morning when she fell from the carriage into my arms.\u201dTheir interactions caught the attention of the students passing by, and they began gossiping amongst themselves.\u201cI thought that Zu An would at least fare a bit better now that he\u2019s a teacher, but it looks like his standing is still the lowest in the family.\u201d\u201cYeah, look at how he whimpers before Chu Second Miss, not daring to fight back at all.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s the life of a drafted-son-in-law. Mooching is tough, y\u2019know.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look too bad. It must be quite pleasurable to get held by such a beautiful sister-in-law.\u201d\u201cShoo, get away from me! What if your fetish is contagious?\u201d\u2026Whisperings could be heard from the students all around. Feeling his reputation falling into tatters, Zu An felt like bursting into tears.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Chu Huanzhao hesitantly released his ear, but she leaned inward to take another sniff of him. The doubt in her eyes refused to disperse. \u201cIs there a fragrance in the world that lasts that long?\u201dZu An replied sheepishly, \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019d know.\u201dChu Huanzhao brooded for a while before finally backing off with a cold harrumph. \u201cHmph, I guess the stench of vixens tends to linger!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Zu An frowned at her choice of vocabulary. \u201cReally, where did you learn such crude words? You\u2019re ruining your reputation like that.\u201d\u201cWhy? Does your heart hurt when I insult Zheng Dan?\u201d Chu Huanzhao morphed from the kind sister-in-law into the little demon who used her whip to lash him. \u201cMy older sister rarely has time to come to the academy, so it goes without saying that I have to keep an eye on you in her place lest you do something that let her down!\u201d\u201cI really didn\u2019t do anything at all! Can you stop slandering me?\u201d Zu An really wanted to burst into tears. Even if I wanted to do something, my current plight doesn\u2019t allow me. Ahhhh, I really must get my hands on the Evanescent Lotus by hook or by crook, no matter what price I have to pay!\u201cThat better be the case!\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed coldly before her complexion finally alleviated. \u201cBrother-in-law, I\u2019m really not making a big fuss out of this. You should also know that my older sister is the dream lover of many men, so it\u2019s inevitable that she would stir the envy of other women. Zheng Dan is one of them. Don\u2019t get fooled by her appearance; she\u2019s approaching you because she wants to prove her superiority by stealing my older sister\u2019s man.\u201dZu An wasn\u2019t too happy to hear those words. \u201cHey! Isn\u2019t it possible that she\u2019s simply approaching me because of my charm?\u201dChu Huanzhao eyed Zu An from head to toe before finally shaking her head. With a perfectly earnest look on her face, she replied, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely impossible.\u201dThat was a critical hit on Zu An\u2019s pride. I really want to beat this fellow up. Can\u2019t she at least lie to make me feel better?\u201cEyyy. Brother-in-law, you need not get so angry. At least you\u2019ve my older sister. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d Chu Huanzhao noticed the awful look on Zu An\u2019s face and quickly placated him with a smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how many people in the academy are envious of you. They would willingly trade twenty years of their lifespan as long as they could marry my older sister in their lifetime!\u201dZu An rolled his eyes. \u201cOthers might not know better, but you should be aware of just what kind of relationship your older sister and I have.\u201dChu Huanzhao smiled sheepishly. She had indeed heard about their peculiar relationship. \u201cYou have to give my older sister some time. You should also know that she\u2019s a proud person. It\u2019s inevitable that she\u2019s unable to get used to you all of a sudden.\u201dZu An\u2019s face further darkened. \u201cIs that how you console a person? Am I really that bad as you say?\u201dChu Huanzhao replied with a nod, \u201cIn the past, even I wouldn\u2019t have bothered sparing a second glance at you. However, after getting to know you, I realized that you are different from the rumors. You do have a lot of strengths. I believe that my older sister will slowly come to like you once she knows what kind of person you are.\u201d\u201cHopefully.\u201d In truth, Zu An wasn\u2019t too bothered about that. What he was the most concerned about at the moment was the Evanescent Lotus. Otherwise, even if Chu Chuyan really fell for him, it would still be for naught.Zu An\u2019s downcast tone and crestfallen silhouette made Chu Huanzhao\u2019s heart feel heavy. My brother-in-law sure is pitiful. My older sister doesn\u2019t like him; my parents scorn him; even the servants don\u2019t show him respect either. He must be having a tough time in the Chu Estate. I must treat him better so that he can feel the warmth of a family.With such thoughts in mind, she ran up to him and called out sweetly, \u201cBrother-in-law~\u201dTaken aback by the abrupt sugar in her voice, Zu An jolted a little before asking, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNothing much. I just wanted to call you.\u201d Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes curled into beautiful crescent smiles.Zu An felt that Chu Huanzhao was acting weirdly, but he was still too absorbed into his own affairs that he didn\u2019t pay it much heed.By the time they walked out of the academy, Cheng Shouping and the servants of the Chu clan were already waiting for them at the entrance. When Cheng Shouping saw Chu Huanzhao fluttering around Zu An like a butterfly, he was astonished.The young master is truly amazing. Not only did he manage to marry the First Miss, but he managed to win over the unruly Second Miss too. I really need to get the young master to teach me a thing or two. If I could just pick up a sliver of what he knows, it\u2019d be more than enough for me to get a beautiful wife!It was a silent trip home. Shortly after they returned to the estate, Chu Zhongtian called the two of them over for dinner. Surprisingly, Chu Chuyan was present as well.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but feel a little perplexed. Chu Chuyan, as a student of Brightmoon Academy, should be expected to attend classes, but weirdly enough, the two of them had never encountered one another in the academy. Judging from Chu Huanzhao\u2019s words, it would appear that she hadn't really been to the academy these few days.He wondered what she was so busy with. It felt like she was constantly heading to all sorts of places. Cheng Shouping once mentioned that many of the Chu clan\u2019s businesses were currently managed by her, which was why she was constantly busy.When Chu Huanzhao saw Chu Chuyan around the dining table, she immediately rushed up to them joyfully. \u201cFather, mother, big sister, you won\u2019t believe what happened in the academy today. Zu An was\u2026\u201dQin Wanru cut her words short, \u201cWe can talk about that later. For now, there\u2019s something more important we need to discuss.\u201dChu Huanzhao turned to Zu An and shrugged helplessly. Her cheeky gestures were really adorable.Zu An felt a surge of warmth in his heart. His sister-in-law did treat him well, though the same couldn\u2019t be said about his mother-in-law. Qin Wanru had quite a domineering personality, and she had never bothered to hide her contempt for him. It was fortunate that her two daughters weren\u2019t like her.I really wonder what\u2019s wrong with Ji Dengtu to actually lust over such a woman. Does he have some sort of weird fetish?If Qin Wanru knew that Zu An thought of her in such a light, she would surely erupt like a volcano.\u201cChuyan, due to the premature opening of the Ursae Dungeon, the tournament against the Yuan clan will be brought forward to two days later. How are your preparations coming along?\u201d asked Qin Wanru.\u201cThe tournament?\u201d Zu An\u2019s heart jolted.This was a matter they had mentioned some time back. The Chu clan and the Yuan clan both dealt in the arms trade, resulting in intense competition between the two of them. However, as nobles, it was beneath them to resort to underhanded methods like common merchants; it wouldn\u2019t look good on any of them. So, they decided to determine the market share by having their juniors fight one another in a tournament.It was intended to be a friendly duel so as to avoid acrimony between the two clans. At the same time, the rivalry would also spur the juniors of the two clans to work harder on their cultivation.Zu An didn\u2019t expect the Clans Tournament to be coming up so quickly.\u201cThere should be no problem,\u201d replied Chu Chuyan. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking over the training of the juniors of our Chu clan, and they have been working diligently. Judging from our past experiences, they should be able to hold their own.\u201dChu Zhongtian frowned. \u201cWe can\u2019t use our previous experiences as a gauge. The Yuan clan has the backing of the Wu clan now, so the cultivators they dispatch are bound to be far stronger than previous years.\u201dHearing those words, Chu Huanzhao couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cSince the Yuan clan is seeking external help, why don\u2019t we do the same too? Aren\u2019t we disadvantaged like that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Chu Zhongtian harrumphed in response. \u201cIf I were to ask for external help like them, wouldn\u2019t that mean that our Chu clan is really afraid of their Wu clan? Besides, I\u2019ve lived my life proudly. I won\u2019t lower myself to resort to such trickeries!\u201dZu An scoffed at those words. Isn\u2019t this the perfect example of someone who would suffer just to uphold his pride? It\u2019s really hard to relate the word, \u2018proud\u2019, to this henpecked husband over here.Chu Chuyan replied, \u201cEven if they engaged the help of the Wu clan, there\u2019s no way they would stand a chance against me.\u201dZu An was a little shaken by those words. He never thought that his wife would actually utter such imposing words. On top of that, no one questioned her words at all, be it Chu Zhongtian, Qin Wanru, or Chu Huanzhao. It was almost as if it was natural for it to be the case.She was a renowned prodigy of Brightmoon City, rumored to be at fifth rank.Zu An had fought with two fifth rank cultivators thus far, and he nearly lost his life on both accounts. That being said, there were likely to be significant differences between fifth rank cultivators. Pei Mianman easily defeated Yuan Wendong in a battle back then even though they were both fifth rank cultivators. That bizarre black flame she summoned was a truly frightening entity.He couldn\u2019t help wondering whether Chu Chuyan or Pei Mianman was more formidable.Now that he thought of Pei Mianman, his thought subconsciously drifted to the night when the two of them brawled with one another in Chu Chuyan\u2019s bedroom. That woman\u2019s figure is truly incredible\u2026\u201cYou might be able to win a match, but there\u2019s a total of ten matches, and one of them is a sure loss. Honestly, I don\u2019t have much confidence in the Clans Tournament this time around.\u201d Qin Wanru shot a glance at Zu An as she shook her head.It was a rule that the juniors in the main family had to participate in one of the ten matches. Other than that, the rules weren\u2019t too strict for others. Regardless of whether one was from the branch family or a servant of the clan, as long as they were strong enough, they could be sent on the field.The Chu clan\u2019s greatest disadvantage was no other than Zu An. The rules dictated that he had to participate in the tournament, and that was a sure loss.Tsk, you sure look down on me. As displeased as Zu An was, he maintained a composed expression and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll surely win my round.\u201dUnfortunately, there wasn\u2019t anyone who took his words to mind. Even Chu Huanzhao, who usually supported him, didn\u2019t think that he could win.\u201cDon\u2019t think about such unrealistic stuff. Let\u2019s go with our previous plan to pit you against Yuan Wendong. Even if you lose the match, you\u2019d still be contributing significantly to the Chu clan. In order to ensure that Yuan Wendong would choose you, I\u2019ll accompany you to the academy tomorrow. Try to find a way to rile him up,\u201d said Chu Chuyan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He never thought that he would hear his wife making such a suggestion.Chu Chuyan thought that Zu An might be feeling intimidated here, so she added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll accompany you tomorrow. No matter how you rile him up, I\u2019ll ensure your safety.\u201dWoah, what\u2019s with this sudden declaration that almost sounds like a confession? Why does it feel like our positions have been swapped over here\u2026 Well, I guess it\u2019s fine. Mooching off others is pretty cool after all.Zu An nodded affirmatively. \u201cRest assured, honey. Since you\u2019ve already said so, I\u2019ll make sure to blow him up with rage!\u201dZu An\u2019s way of referring to Chu Chuyan as \u2018honey\u2019 brought frowns to Chu Chuyan and Qin Wanru\u2019s faces, but in the end, neither of them said anything about it.\u201cBig sister, you\u2019ll be heading to the academy tomorrow?\u201d asked Chu Huanzhao.\u201cI am. What\u2019s with your expression?\u201d asked Chu Chuyan with a smile. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that you\u2019ve stirred trouble in the academy, and you\u2019re worried that the teachers will complain to me?\u201d\u201cOf course not! It\u2019s just that you haven\u2019t been to the academy for quite some time now. I\u2019m just delighted,\u201d Chu Huanzhao replied indignantly as she secretly winked at Zu An. \u201cSpeaking of which, I remember that the Sky class has an arithmetic class tomorrow?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d replied Chu Chuyan. \u201cActually, most of the cultivation classes in the academy doesn\u2019t serve much of a purpose to me anymore. Instead, it\u2019s the arithmetic classes and such that are more useful. After all, the Chu clan has many finance-related matters that need dealing with.\u201dChu Huanzhao tried her best to suppress her smile as she replied with a strained face, \u201cIt just so happens that the academy brought in a new arithmetic teacher. He might be more to your liking.\u201d\u201cThe arithmetic teacher has been changed? What happened to Yang Wei?\u201d Chu Chuyan was surprised to hear that news. She had been too busy dealing with the affairs in the Chu clan that she hadn\u2019t paid any attention to the recent happenings in the academy.\u201cIt seems like Yang Wei has been fired for oppressing his students,\u201d replied Chu Huanzhao vaguely.\u201cI can\u2019t deny that Yang Wei\u2019s character has a problem,\u201d Chu Chuyan pondered about it for a moment before remarking. \u201cHowever, his skills in arithmetic is the real deal. I\u2019m not sure if the new teacher will be able to fill his gap.\u201d\u201cOh, he definitely will!\u201d Chu Huanzhao shot a glance at Zu An as she replied. \u201cYang Wei had a competition with the new teacher earlier today, but he ended up suffering a complete loss.\u201d\u201cHuanzhao, why do you keep looking at your brother-in-law while talking?\u201d Qin Wanru asked in displeasure. She felt like her second daughter was getting excessively close with Zu An. But again, Huanzhao has always been a candid child. Am I thinking too much into it?Chu Huanzhao stuck out her tongue in response. She was still planning to brag about Zu An before her parents, but upon hearing that her older sister was going to have an arithmetic class in the academy the following day, she changed her mind.If she enters the classroom and sees that the teacher is Zu An, I wonder how she\u2019d react.Just thinking about the matter was enough to pump her up with excitement.\u201cComplete loss? Are you certain? It\u2019s hard to imagine that someone of Yang Wei\u2019s caliber would be thoroughly defeated.\u201d Chu Chuyan was astonished. \u201cHow did they compete with one another?\u201dThe excited Chu Huanzhao immediately began painting a scenario for her audience. \u201cIt started with Yang Wei setting twenty questions for the new teacher, but unexpectedly, the new teacher actually got all of them correct swiftly. Afterward, the new teacher set twenty questions for Yang Wei, but in the end, Yang Wei didn\u2019t manage to get even a single question correctly.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t get a single question correctly?\u201d Chu Chuyan widened her eyes. \u201cHow could that be possible? What kind of questions did the new teacher set?\u201dChu Huanzhao shot a glance at Zu An, only to see the mirth in his eyes. He must be quite delighted right now. Heh, look at how hard I\u2019m working to brag for him. I\u2019ll be expecting something good from him for this.\u201cThe questions set by the new teacher is a little peculiar\u2026\u201d Following that, she began to roughly explain the twenty questions. As for those that she wasn\u2019t too sure about, she naturally turned over to ask Zu An.No one on the scene harbored any doubts at all. It was an open competition after all, and Zu An was a student of the academy. It was nothing much for him to know the details of the competition.After hearing the twenty questions, Chu Chuyan gasped in amazement. \u201cThat new teacher seems truly formidable. I\u2019m starting to get a bit curious about him.\u201d\u201cYou should be.\u201d A gleeful glean from having succeeded in her prank shone in Chu Huanzhao\u2019s eyes. It had been a long time since she was this happy.\u201cHmph, it\u2019s nothing more than small tricks.\u201d Qin Wanru harrumphed. \u201cUltimately, one\u2019s cultivation is still the most important of all in this world. Don\u2019t hold up the advancement of your cultivation over such trivialities.\u201d\u201cChuyan, it\u2019s good that you\u2019ve helped us manage the family business over the years, but these are all of minor importance. You mustn\u2019t get too caught up in them,\u201d said Chu Zhongtian.Chu Chuyan replied with a smile, \u201cRest assured, I know my priorities.\u201dChu Zhongtian nodded in relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You have always been mature even at a young age, and your mother and I have never needed to worry about you before.\u201dQin Wanru glared at her second daughter and said, \u201cHuanzhao, take a look at your older sister. She already has things set straight whereas you\u2019re still spending your days idly and getting into trouble.\u201dThe smile on Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face immediately froze in place. I know that you want to compliment my big sister, but surely you don\u2019t have to come around and berate me too, right?Meanwhile, Zu An was finally coming to a realization why Chu Huanzhao was so rebellious the first time they met. She had been compared with her outstanding big sister ever since a young age, and no matter what she tried, she was unable to catch up with her footsteps at all. Anyone in her position would inevitably feel horrible about it.On top of that, Chu Huanzhao had quite a cold personality too. All in all, this family really didn\u2019t have any ordinary human. In a sense, it would appear that Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru weren\u2019t really good at raising kids.Oh well. Since she has an unhappy childhood, I guess I should try to take care of her a little more.\u201cYou too, Zu An!\u201d Qin Wanru was still in the midst of berating her daughter when she noticed how Zu An was watching all of these with a leisurely look on his face. She thought about all of the trouble that had occurred ever since Zu An joined the family, and her rage suddenly flurried. What are you acting so leisurely for? You\u2019re worse than Huanzhao!Zu An was astonished. He never thought that he would suddenly be implicated in this.Meanwhile, Chu Huanzhao was glad to see that Zu An was there to tank the firepower. It looks like I\u2019ll have a better life ahead of me now that my brother-in-law has joined the family.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll heed your teachings, mother-in-law,\u201d replied Zu An obediently. He had already gotten a good grasp as to who was the one truly in charge here. In any case, there was no reason for him to provoke Qin Wanru if he could avoid doing so.\u201cForget it!\u201d Qin Wanru was going to tell Zu An to work harder, and that even if he couldn\u2019t cultivate, he could at least help with the family business and alleviate Chu Chuyan\u2019s stress. At the very least, Chu Chuyan\u2019s talents wouldn\u2019t go to waste.However, she suddenly remembered Chu Chuyan\u2019s intention for bringing him in and fell at a loss for words.Given Zu An\u2019s nature, it was a better use of time to tutor Huanzhao instead. She was more likely to be of help in the future. With such thoughts in mind, she directed her sharp eyes back to her second daughter and began nagging her.Chu Huanzhao was stunned. Why do you nagging me?! Let me have my meal in peace, alright?After dinner was over, Zu An returned back to his room to look at the Rage points he had earned. Be it for the upcoming Clans Tournament or the soon-to-open Ursae Dungeon which contains the Evanescent Lotus, he would need great power to back him up.God knows what Yuan Wendong is planning for the Clans Tournament two days later.Even though Yuan Wendong had been crushed by Pei Mianman, there was still no doubt that he was a fifth rank cultivator. If he were to pull some kind of despicable move to kill him on the dueling ring\u2026That doesn\u2019t seem quite possible. I do have the Chu clan behind me after all.However, it was still possible for him to feign carelessness to take one of his limbs or something. He had read plenty of novels in his previous life, and it was usually the offspring of noble clans that were the most despicable of all.While Chu Chuyan did promise to ensure his safety, it wasn\u2019t like Zu An to put all of his eggs in one basket. Becoming strong himself was the real way to go.Including the points he had saved up from the last draw, he had 88,018 Rage points at the moment. Most of them came from the crowd when Jiang Luofu announced that he was going to take over Yang Wei as Brightmoon Academy\u2019s arithmetic teacher.Hehe, I sure was sharp-witted to immediately capitalize on the situation to trigger them.Zu An was quite gleeful about it. At the same time, he affirmed his previous thoughts that it was inefficient for him to squeeze Rage points out of an individual. It was much better juicing a crowd simultaneously. To be honest, the academy still wasn\u2019t a large enough stage for him to truly shine. A day would eventually come where he would stand before thousands and squeeze out the Rage points from them.Just thinking about it makes me a little excited.Old rules, he started off by washing his hands and face before beginning to draw the lottery.As expected, he received a series of \u2018Thanks for playing!\u2019.However, Zu An had already gotten used to it. He simply continued drawing the lottery, watching as the light marker flew across the various keys on the keyboard.Thanks for participating\u2026 Ki Fruit\u2026 Thanks for participating\u2026 Thanks for participating\u2026 Ki Fruit\u2026 Whatcha Staring At\u2026 Thanks for participating\u2026 Ki Fruit\u2026Zu An was starting to feel that drawing the lottery was really quite troublesome. If a day came where he managed to amass several million Rage points, he would probably draw it till his hands broke.Hm? Wait a moment, I think I just got something weird?Zu An took a look at his own logs and realized that he had managed to draw a new skill.He was initially still feeling a little lethargic, but his body immediately shot upright when he realized that he had gotten something. The last few skills he obtained were all pretty useful, so he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the new skill would be.He saw that the keyboard\u2019s letter \u2018N\u2019 was lit up. He tapped down on it, and he saw three words: Whatcha Staring At.Zu An was stunned. Is the keyboard mocking me here?He pressed the letter \u2018N\u2019 once more, but the same three words continued to linger on the screen, as if mocking his foolishness.\u201cWhat the hell? I\u2019m staring at you, shithead! What about it?\u201d Zu An roared angrily.Ding~As if some sort of condition had been fulfilled, several more lines appeared on the screen.\u201cCongratulations on obtaining the skill: Whatcha Staring At!\u201dSkill Effect: It\u2019s said that this is a taboo phrase in a certain region. Once used, it\u2019ll result in a calamity of bloodshed. Whenever you use this skill, the target will reply you with \u201cI\u2019m staring at you shithead! What about it?\u201dZu An blinked his eyes in confusion. Is that all? Nothing else?Unwilling to give up, he squinted to see if there were any hidden words in small print or something, but there was nothing else.What\u2019s with this shitty skill?! What\u2019s the use of making the other party say a couple of words?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBe it the Heiress\u2019 Ball of Delights of the Knock-You-Up Eyes, while their names and descriptions sounded utterly horrendous, they were items that could bring forth incredible effects in desperate moments if used well.However, Zu An couldn\u2019t think of even a single practical use for this skill.All it did was to make the other party reply \u2018I\u2019m staring at you, shithead. What about it?\u2019. Could there be anything more useless than this?At this moment, a thought suddenly arose in Zu An\u2019s mind. Could it be a taunt skill to earn the enemy\u2019s Rage points?However, he soon refuted that line of thought. Even if it hadn\u2019t been officialized into a skill, just saying the words \u2018Whatcha looking at?\u2019 was more than enough to provoke most people.One thing was surprised him though was that this skill didn\u2019t have a limit to its use, unlike the other artifacts and skills he had received.This assuaged Zu An\u2019s heart a little. But again, this skill was indeed much less useful than the previous few. He suddenly didn\u2019t know whether he should celebrate or weep in sorrow.With a deep sigh, he continued to draw the lottery. He didn\u2019t get anything else afterward; they were all either \u2018Thanks for playing\u2019 or Ki Fruits. This was within his expectations though. After all, it was nearly impossible for him to be so lucky as to draw two skills or artifacts in a single seating.So far, his third formation had been filled by a third. By devouring all of the Ki Fruits he had drawn, he managed to fill up the third formation fully. Based on the amount of ki he had at the moment, he felt that he could summon Grandgale twice now. Previously, it would sap him dry just to summon it once.Looks like my ki capacity is indeed increasing along with my growth.Zu An was curious as to whether he would really unlock a new skill once the nine formations had been filled. There was no doubt that Grandgale was a formidable skill, and this was only the first one. Surely the skills that came after it would be even more powerful, right?However, when he thought about the astronomical amount of Rage points he would require to raise his cultivation level, he shook his head helplessly. Forget it, I shouldn\u2019t think about all this for now. For the time being, I should focus on preparing for the battle two days later!With his current ability, he was pretty confident that he would be able to protect himself against Yuan Wendong on the dueling ring. However, according to what Jiang Luofu said, the cultivators would grow disproportionately stronger upward. This was because strong cultivators had the ability to secure cultivation resources for themselves, allowing them to grow faster than the others. So, it would be unwise for him to simply keep hiding his abilities.Zu An also belatedly realized the significance of being a member of the Chu clan. He was sitting on such a huge ship at the moment; it would be a huge waste if he didn\u2019t put it to its full use. At the very least, he was determined to make the other members of the Chu clan acknowledge him.While he did grumble about his wife and in-laws\u2019 cold attitude toward him, deep down, he was aware that their prejudice toward him was justified. He was indeed a good-for-nothing before. Had he been in their position, he would have surely scorned himself too.In fact, putting aside Chu Huanzhao, both Chu Chuyan and Chu Zhongtian actually treated him fairly well despite having the notion that he was a good-for-nothing. It was only Qin Wanru who kept berating him, sometimes even punishing him to copy the family rules.Hmph, I should have given your dudou to Ji Dengtu that pervert\u2026Jiang Luofu\u2019s advice made him realize that it was time for him to show his capability before the Chu clan. At the very least, he had to let them know that he was an asset to the Chu clan. By then, perhaps Chu Chuyan would willingly fawn on him too\u2026Just thinking about it made Zu An giggle under his breath. Saliva began dripping from the corner of his lips.The only issue was that he didn\u2019t think he was strong enough to defeat Yuan Wendong yet. After all, the latter was a fifth rank cultivator, but he had the ability to control multiple weapons simultaneously in battle, making him seem almost like those swordmasters in fantasy novels. Pei Mianman was able to melt his weapons with ease, but if he were to be placed in the same position, the more likely conclusion was him getting punctured with holes.Also, he didn\u2019t want to showcase all of his trump cards on a public dueling ring. He did want to prove his worth, but giving away all of his means was nothing short of foolishness. That would just be giving his enemies vital intelligence required to deal with him.That\u2019s why people in my previous life preach about humility and low profile. A wise man would silently strike it rich than to parade his wealth around. Those who stick out too much would only incur the envy of others and be eventually destroyed.After a long moment of contemplation, Zu An decided to turn his attention toward the Thirteen Forms of Elementary Swordplay Bai Susu imparted to them earlier today. This swordplay might be of limited use to normal people, but its nature was very fitting for him. If he could defeat Yuan Wendong with this swordplay, he would be able to prove his own worth without giving away his trump cards.With such thoughts in mind, he began to quiver in excitement. He picked up the sword he received from the academy and began practicing the moves. Perhaps it was due to his transcendent class aptitude, but he could still clearly remember the movements Bai Susu had demonstrated to them earlier in the day as if he had returned to the scene itself.His movements were still a little awkward at the start, but after several repetitions, his movements began to flow much more smoothly.\u201cOh? I didn\u2019t expect you to have such high talent. You were actually able to grasp the academy\u2019s Elementary Swordplay so quickly. All you\u2019re lacking now is just practice,\u201d an eerie voice suddenly sounded.Zu An recoiled in shock. He turned around, only to see a scrawny, hunched figure standing not too far away in the garden. Who else could it be if not Old Mi?\u201cWhen did you arrive?\u201d asked Zu An with an innocent smile. On the inside, however, he warned himself to be more careful the next time around. Otherwise, if Old Mi were to discover the trump cards he had, he might just get screwed over.\u201cI\u2019ve been here for some time now,\u201d replied Old Mi. \u201cI heard that you\u2019re likely to be up against Yaun Wendong in the Clans Tournament?\u201d\u201cYeah, it seems so,\u201d replied Zu An helplessly. What could he do when the Chu clan viewed him as the \u2018inferior horse\u2019 to tie down the \u2018superior horse\u2019?\u201cYou\u2019re intending to use the Elementary Swordplay to deal with Yuan Wendong?\u201d Old Mi stroked his beard as he stared at Zu An intently.Zu An felt goosebumps rising up under Old Mi\u2019s sinister gaze. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know any combat skills other than this.\u201d\u201cThe Elementary Swordplay is the basic swordplay imparted to everyone in the academy, so it goes without saying that Yuan Wendong has learned it as well. I heard that he\u2019s a fifth rank cultivator. Aren\u2019t you courting death for attempting to challenge him with the Elementary Swordplay?\u201d Old Mi harrumphed.Zu An protested weakly, \u201cBut I heard from the teachers of the academy that this swordplay isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. It\u2019s the foundation of all swordplay, and even true swordmasters who have reached a certain point would eventually return back to it\u2026\u201d\u201cYou actually believe those nonsense teachers of the academy spout in order to spur the students\u2019 motivation?\u201d Old Mi looked at Zu An as if he was an idiot. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong to say that cultivators, upon reaching a certain level, would return back to the basics, but it only works out because they had overwhelming speed and strength to crush their enemies. A newbie like you taking this swordplay to deal with an expert; you\u2019re really asking for a wallop!\u201dZu An replied with a sheepish smile, \u201cWell, I\u2019m queued at the very end. It\u2019s probably unlikely that I would even get onto the dueling ring in the first place.\u201dOld Mi fell silent for a while before suddenly asking, \u201cI heard that you have a grudge with Yuan Wendong?\u201dZu An was surprised to hear that from Old Mi. The latter appeared to be always in the Chu clan, yet he seemed to know everything that was going on outside. \u201cAh\u2026 We did have a bit of conflict in the academy.\u201d\u201cA bit of conflict?\u201d Old Mi scoffed. \u201cI heard that Yuan Wendong declared that he\u2019d cripple you.\u201d\u201cWell, he did suffer some grievances against me back then. He might just be spouting threats in a fit of anger,\u201d replied Zu An.\u201cYou had someone to fish you out the last time, but who can possibly save you on the dueling ring two days later?\u201d Old Mi rolled his eyes, which made his already terrifying face even more frightening. \u201cI heard that the First Miss wanted you to provoke Yuan Wendong once more tomorrow?\u201d\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d Zu An felt a shudder running down his spine. This matter should only be known amongst the few of them who were on the dining table earlier. How in the world did Old Mi learn about it too? Could it be possible that he knows about the keyboard too?\u201cPreposterous! Even if the First Miss doesn\u2019t like you, you shouldn\u2019t toss you into the fiery pit just like that!\u201d Old Mi stomped his feet in anger.His outburst made Zu An feel heartened. \u201cElder, please don\u2019t worry. My wife is just resorting to the \u2018have the weakest tie down the strongest\u2019 strategy. I\u2019m the one going up last, so there\u2019s a good chance that I won\u2019t need to fight at all.\u201dOld Mi shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s different this time around. The Yuan clan came prepared. There\u2019s a high probability that you would have to fight as well. I\u2019ll impart to you a movement skill so that you\u2019ll at least be able to protect yourself on the dueling ring.\u201dZu An was taken aback for a moment before he suddenly cried out, \u201cElder, you treat me too well!\u201d To think that he actually doubted Old Mi\u2019s kind intention all this while!Old Mi replied with a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything much I hope for in this life; I just hope that you can fulfill my regrets. I can\u2019t have you losing an arm or a leg.\u201dYou must be joking. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to find someone suitable, so how could I let that brat, Yuan Wendong, leave any scars on your body?!Zu An had no idea that Old Mi had other thoughts in mind, so he was utterly moved by the latter\u2019s gesture. There had only so few people who had treated him kindly ever since he came to this world, and Old Mi was indubitably one of them.Old Mi cleared his throat and said, \u201cThis movement skill is called \u2018Sunflower Phantasm\u2019. It doesn\u2019t require much ki to activate, but its effects are top-notch. For those who are talented, it\u2019ll only take half a year in order to reach minor accomplishment. We\u2019re short of time, but considering that your opponent is Yuan Wendong, it should be enough.\u201dZu An was a little perplexed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. If the movement skill is top-notch, shouldn\u2019t it require much ki to activate?\u201dOld Mi chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not trying to trick you here. While this movement skill requires very little ki to execute, there\u2019s actually a huge hurdle that most people are unable to overcome. But as for you\u2026\u201dAt this point, Old Mi shot a glance at Zu An\u2019s crotch meaningful and remarked, \u201cThe hurdle is nonexistent for you!\u201dZu An blinked his eyes in bewilderment. What does that mean?Old Mi coughed softly and said, \u201cGather your focus. I\u2019m going to impart to you Sunflower Phantasm\u2019s formula, ki pathways, and crux to you. Listen carefully\u2026\u201dRoughly two hours later, Zu An began moving flitting from left to right, again and again, leaving Old Mi utterly giddy. It took a while before he found his voice and asked, \u201cDid you actually know the Sunflower Phantasm beforehand?\u201dZu An shook his head and replied, \u201cOf course not.\u201d\u201cThen how did you manage to grasp it so quickly? No, it\u2019s already at the level of minor accomplishment!\u201d Old Mi exclaimed.\u201cI guess I\u2019m just talented?\u201d Zu An asked shyly.1. It\u2019s a rude remark often used in China when someone is looking in your direction, and it has provoked several fights before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOld Mi simply disregarded those words. A renowned wastrel of Brightmoon City actually had good talent? Is it even possible? Everyone else must have been blind all these years!He could only think of one explanation in the end. \u201cPerhaps your body is suited for this movement skill. Quickly familiarize yourself with it. It should be enough for you to at least survive against Yuan Wendong. Also, don\u2019t tell anyone about this martial skill, and don\u2019t speak of its name \u2018Sunflower Phantasm\u2019 either. You might get in trouble.\u201dZu An hurriedly nodded in response, \u201cYes, I understand.\u201dLooks like Old Mi is quite a low profile person too. If that wasn\u2019t the case, how could he possibly remain as a humble gardener in the Chu clan for so many years?Old Mi finally left the garden in peace after hearing Zu An\u2019s assurance.Zu An continued practicing Sunflower Phantasm, but a thought soon surfaced in his mind. This movement skill is unpredictable and fast. It\u2019s too much of a waste to use it just for defense. What if I were to use it for offense?Zu An recalled Bai Susu saying that the Elementary Swordplay was focused on dealing the greatest damage against one\u2019s opponent at the fastest speed possible in the shortest distance. It had many openings in the eyes of a true swordmaster, but if one could move fast enough, these openings were practically nonexistent since they couldn\u2019t be exploited.Just thinking about it made Zu An a little excited. He started practicing \u2018Thirteen Forms of Elementary Swordplay\u2019 and \u2018Sunflower Phantasm\u2019 in unison. Before, the Elementary Swordplay looked quite monotonous and straightforward, but once combined together with Sunflower Phantasm, brilliant gleams of light began flashing around the garden in unpredictable trajectories.If someone were to walk into the garden right now, they would only see a shadow flitting all around. They might even get afraid.All of a sudden, Zu An sensed something and hurriedly retracted his sword. Following that, a couple of guards rushed over, asking, \u201cYoung master, is something wrong?\u201dThese were the guards that Chu Zhongtian had assigned to protect him after the incident with Snow back then. You sure are useful. I didn\u2019t see you rushing in when Old Mi strutted right in earlier.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just practicing my swordsmanship.\u201d Zu An wiped the sweat off his forehead as he beamed a smile at them.\u201cAlright, we shan\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201dSeeing that there was nothing amiss, the guards quickly retreated.\u201cOur young master\u2019s body sure is weak. Just practicing the Elementary Swordplay is enough to fill his head with sweat.\u201d\u201cI sure pity our young miss.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m certain heard quite a huge commotion coming from there earlier though. Am I hearing things?\u201d\u201cTsk, your nerves must be too strung up during this period of time. Do you think that it\u2019s possible for our young master to have caused a huge commotion by himself?\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u2026Zu An\u2019s face darkened upon hearing the whispers around. It looked like there was really a need to improve on his reputation.He was still worried about the Clans Tournament at the start, but he was more certain now that he had the Sunflower Phantasm. This movement skill and the Elementary Swordplay were a perfect combo, reminiscent of the Bixie Swordplay Manual from right off the novel.But all of a sudden, his face suddenly stiffened. He noticed that there was the word \u2018Sunflower\u2019 inside the term, and Old Mi mentioned that there was a huge hurdle to overcome in order to learn the movement skill, such that most people wouldn\u2019t be able to grasp it. On top of that, there was that lingering gaze on his crotch\u2026What the hell!This can\u2019t be the Sunflower Manual, can it?!As soon as this thought surfaced in his mind, he quickly tossed the sword in his hand away in fright.Are you going to continue harping on this?!Zu An could feel the malice the world bore toward him. It was one thing for \u2018little Zu An\u2019 to be sealed, but he even got paired with the Sunflower Manual and the Bixie Swordplay Manual?!With an awful look on his face, Zu An stomped his way back to his residence and went to sleep. He lost all motivation to continue practicing.\u2026Meanwhile, there was another person who was in a worse mood. In the headquarters of the Plum Blossom Sect, an expensive porcelain cup was smashed onto the floor, shattering into innumerable pieces.Kneeling on the floor, Mei Chaofeng\u2019s eyelids twitched in horror. That was his favorite teacup. He had spent a great deal of effort in order to acquire it, and he was so fond of it that it always kept it by his side. If anyone were to touch the teacup, he would have had the person dragged down, diced into pieces, and fed to the dogs. However, against the person who had just smashed it into pieces, he dared not to rage at all. He could only tremble fearfully on the ground.There was another person kneeling next to him at the moment. She was dressed in a green robe, and her hair was tied into a beautiful ponytail. It was no other than Snow.Mei Chaofeng had always had a bad impression of this lass, but right now, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of camaraderie with her.On the chair majestically sat a young man. He was dressed in a purple silk robe with a white belt fastening it on his waist. He had long lustrous black hair and a beautiful face, giving him a graceful appearance.It was just that he had a livid look on his face at the moment. He glared at the two kneeling people before him with rage in his eyes.\u201cThe two of you sure are competent! Snow, it wasn\u2019t long ago that you sent me a message telling me that everything is under control. You told me that you would make that trash, Zu An, disappear from the face of the world soon enough. Yet, you\u2019re telling me now that you got exposed and had to flee from the Chu clan?\u201dThe young man had a smile on his face, but his tone was utterly cold and biting.\u201cYoung master, please pardon me! Some minor accidents occurred along the way!\u201d Snow lowered her head in utter shame as she gritted her teeth tightly. She had wanted to share the young master\u2019s burden, but who could have thought that she would mess things up?On top of that, of all people, she actually screwed up because of that renowned wastrel!\u201cMinor accidents?\u201d the young master sneered coldly. \u201cDo you know how many resources and connections I had to tap into in order to have you infiltrate the Chu clan? You have already infiltrated their midst for several years, and it was about time to reap the fruits of your harvest, but you messed it all up just like that!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll surely make up for my mistakes! Young master, please spare me!\u201d Snow kowtowed deeply onto the ground, her body trembling uncontrollably.The young master harrumphed as he turned his head aside, not wanting to even look at her anymore. He turned to Mei Chaofeng and bellowed, \u201cYou too! Snow is still young, so it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s inexperienced when it comes to such worldly matters. However, you\u2019re the veteran here, a powerhouse of the underworld. How did you manage to get done in by that trash too? You actually lost 7,500,000 silver taels to him! Did you even earn me that much money in total over the years?\u201dCold sweat dripped down Mei Chaofeng\u2019s back. Is the young master intending to send a warning out through me? He berated Snow harshly earlier, only to let her go softly. Yet, when it came to me, he\u2019s starting to pursue responsibility.He anxiously explained, \u201cI apologize for my mistake. It was already too late by the time I received the news. I never thought that someone would be able to earn 7,500,000 silver taels in just two short matches. Also, I wasn\u2019t planning to acknowledge the debt, but Miss Qiao insisted that I accept the debt note, so I had no choice but to go along.\u201dHis nervousness was not unfounded. The young man before him was the Sixth Young Master of the Shi clan, Shi Kun. With his father serving as the Minister of War, there was no question that the Shi clan was one of the most prominent clans in the capital. Shi Kun was a dashing person, but on top of that, he was also a renowned prodigy too. He had the hearts of everyone in the Shi clan, and he was often entrusted with great responsibilities too.He was managed most of the \u2018underground affairs\u2019 of the Shi clan too. Based on what Mei Chaofeng knew, there were many equivalents of the Plum Blossom Sect operating in the other prefectures all over the country.Despite the imposing appearance of the Plum Blossom Sect, in truth, most of its earnings had to be submitted upward to the Shi clan. That was also the reason why Shi Kun was so angry when he learned that they actually owed Zu An so much money.\u201cOh? Snow got you to write it?\u201d Shi Kun turned to look at Snow. \u201cAre you the spy of our Shi clan, or are the spy of the Chu clan?\u201dSnow hurriedly explained the situation. \u201cYoung master, there was no way to defuse the situation back then. I didn\u2019t want to cause any complications in the matter, and I thought that it would be easy to get the debt note back anyway, so I didn\u2019t think too much into it.\u201dShi Kun harrumphed angrily. \u201cThe Shi clan has groomed you for so many years, yet you still remain so incompetently ignorant! Did you think that the Chu clan would really dare to mobilize their Red Cloak Army there? As long as they made a move, the royal court would surely crack down on them the following day!\u201dSnow lowered his head. \u201cIt was my mistake.\u201dShi Kun continued his interrogation, \u201cI can let that matter slip, but how did you manage to fail to assassinate Zu An?\u201d\u201cThat fellow looks like a good-for-nothing on the surface, but he\u2019s actually a cultivator,\u201d replied Snow.\u201cHe\u2019s a cultivator? What rank is he at?!\u201d Shi Kun immediately rose to his feet in agitation.\u201cAround the third rank, but there\u2019s something weird about his fighting prowess\u2026\u201d Snow was a little uncertain about this. In terms of ki pulsations, it wasn\u2019t wrong to say that Zu An was at the third rank, but in a real fight, the force he exerted far surpassed that.\u201cA fifth rank cultivator like you couldn\u2019t even kill a third rank cultivator?\u201d Shi Kun found the situation so ludicrous that he began roaring in laughter. \u201cHave all your training gone to waste?\u201dSnow\u2019s face reddened. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what happened either. My stomach suddenly started hurting\u2026\u201dShe had gotten a physician to check on her condition afterward, and there was nothing wrong with her body. When she enquired deeper into the sensations she felt, all of the physicians she consulted told her that those were the symptoms that a mother would experience during childbirth.However, Snow was still a maiden. How could she possibly be pregnant? On top of that, those symptoms simply vanished all of a sudden, leaving her utterly confused as to what was happening to her body.\u201cYour stomach started aching during a critical moment? Utterly incompetent!\u201d Shi Kun roared with an awful look on his face. \u201cSince Zu An isn\u2019t a wastrel, it would appear that he has been intentionally concealing his capabilities. His efforts did pay off, since he managed to lower the Chu clan\u2019s guard toward him and successfully became their drafted son-in-law. If he\u2019s a wastrel, I would have nothing to worry about. However, if he\u2019s just putting on an act, there\u2019s a good chance that he might win Chu First Miss\u2019 heart and body!\u201dJust thinking about someone as beautiful as Chu Chuyan laying in Zu An\u2019s embrace was enough to fill Shi Kun with burning envy.Snow knew what Shi Kun was worried about, so she quickly clarified, \u201cYoung master, there\u2019s no need to worry. The two of them are sleeping in different rooms, and the young miss isn\u2019t fond of Zu An at all. She won\u2019t let him get his way with her.\u201d\u201cThat might be true for the time being, but how can we be certain for the future?\u201d Shi Kun rose to his feet in agitation. \u201cThis won\u2019t do. We need to deal with the problem as soon as possible. What\u2019s the progress with the plan you\u2019re working on at the moment?\u201dMei Chaofeng shot a glance at Snow before explaining the situation almost mockingly, \u201cMiss Qiao arranged for an insider to get Zu An expelled from Brightmoon Academy so that I could find an opportunity to get rid of him outside. However, the person she engaged failed to chase Zu An out; on the contrary, he got expelled from the academy instead.\u201dShi Kun could hardly believe what he was hearing. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t rushed here due to the opening of the Ursae Dungeon, I would have never known that there were so many issues cropping up here! Hurry up and tell me what\u2019s going on!\u201dSnow had an awkward look on his face. \u201cI tapped into your connection in Brightmoon City to get Yang Wei to assist me in getting Zu An expelled from the academy. Yet, who could have thought that Zu An was actually more skilled than Yang Wei in the field of arithmetic? In the end, Yang Wei ended up getting expelled instead.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why is this fellow able to do everything?\u201d Shi Kun was astonished. The reports he had received thus far had all reflected Zu An to be a good-for-nothing, but the reality was painting him a different picture.Well, I can think of one thing that that fellow is inept in. Snow\u2019s face reddened, but she had no intention of informing Shi Kun about it.1. It\u2019s a skill used by Dongfang Bubai in the Proud, Smiling Wanderer. He\u2019s an antagonist who\u2019s known to have castrated himself in order to learn the Sunflower Manual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Keyboard ImmortalCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI\u2019m starting to get interested in this fellow after hearing what you said. I\u2019ll be heading to the academy tomorrow to test him out myself.\u201d Shi Kun gazed in the direction of the academy as he spoke with a confident and composed tone, as if he was just going to settle a trivial matter.Snow hung her head in shame. It\u2019s due to my incompetence that the young master has to make a move personally.\u201cYoung master Sang is still waiting for me outside. I\u2019ll pay him a visit.\u201d Shi Kun stood up and headed toward the doorway, but before walking out, he suddenly halted his footsteps. He turned around and asked Mei Chaofeng, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of your subordinate who lost 7,500,000 silver taels?\u201d\u201cPlum Blossom Seven,\u201d replied Mei Chaofeng fearfully.Shi Kun nodded silently for a moment before remarking calmly, \u201cThere\u2019s no use keeping useless things by your side. Dice him up and feed him to the dogs.\u201d\u201cY-yes!\u201d Mei Chaofeng felt a chill in his heart.He knew that Shi Kun was indirectly sending him a warning through those words. He felt rather indignant about this. He was supposed to be the king of Brightmoon City\u2019s underworld, a powerhouse possessing unquestionable authority. When had he ever been threatened by a youngster like this before?However, as displeased as Mei Chaofeng was, as soon as he saw the old man that had been following Shi Kun around, all of his displeasure immediately eroded. Shi Kun was no threat to him\u2014the other party was unlikely to even be a match for him\u2014but the old man, on the other hand, was far stronger than him.It looks like the Shi clan is a force to be reckoned with. Even a guard of theirs possesses this much strength.Mei Chaofeng suddenly felt a sliver of despair. It looked like those of the pugilistic worlds like him were doomed to be led around by the nose by prominent clans.At the lounge outside, Sang Qian was getting impatient from all the waiting. However, as soon as he saw Shi Kun walking over, he put on a smiling face to welcome him, \u201cYoung master Shi, it has been a long while. You still look as suave as you used to be.\u201dThe lividness on Shi Kun\u2019s face had also been replaced by a warm smile too. \u201cIt has indeed been a while since we parted at the capital, but you still look as awe-inspiring as ever.\u201dThe two of them were acquainted with one another. After trading some pleasantries, Shi Kun finally got to the topic on hand, \u201cMay I ask what your father\u2019s intentions are? He has yet to make a move despite having moved over to the Linchuan Commandery. I\u2019m rather confused as to what he\u2019s intending to do.\u201dSang Qian smiled in response. \u201cMy father has been preparing some stuff during this period of time. He says that if young master Shi wishes to make a move, you may go ahead first. Our plans will not interfere with one another.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Governor Sang Hong always plans properly before making his move, but it looks like it\u2019s truly the case.\u201dIn his mind, however, Shi Kun sneered coldly. He\u2019s just trying to push me to the front so that I can take the brunt of the impact. You\u2019re going to make me look like I can\u2019t deal with the Chu clan so that you can step out at the last moment to \u2018clean up the mess\u2019?\u201cBrother Shi is too polite. My father is just worried that he might affect your plans to conquer Chu First Miss if he makes a move in advance. If you can successfully bring Chu First Miss over to your side, it\u2019ll save us a lot of trouble.\u201dSang Hong\u2019s words were polite, but his heart was filled with envy. There was no man who wouldn\u2019t be interested in Chu Chuyan after witnessing her ravishing looks. It was just that while his father had been rising through the ranks, the foundation of the Sang clan was still shaky at the moment. In terms of accumulation, they were nowhere on par with established clans with centuries of history behind them.Not to mention, there were even people like Shi Kun pursuing her. Sang Hong knew that there was no way he would stand a chance at all. Thus, he could only make do with the Zheng clan.It was fortunate that Zheng Dan was beautiful too; it was just that her cultivation and standing were slightly lacking. Nevertheless, he was still satisfied with having such a woman as his wife.Thinking about Zheng Dan reminded him of the honey trap plan he had entrusted her to put into action a while back. He had checked in with her to see how it was going, but it seemed like she hadn\u2019t succeeded yet. That being said, quoting her words, \u2018everything is going according to plan\u2019.Hmph, I just hope that she doesn\u2019t get taken advantage of by that Zu An.He thought about how Zheng Dan wouldn\u2019t even allow him to hold her hand, and that assuaged his worries by a fair bit. There\u2019s no way she would allow that trash to come close to her.Meanwhile, Shi Kun was clearly pleased with Sang Hong\u2019s flattery. \u201cHahaha, I\u2019m sure things would go well with Brother Sang\u2019s words of blessing. Once I manage to capture Chu First Miss\u2019 heart, I\u2019ll make sure to send you a wedding invitation, and we\u2019ll have a good drink together!\u201dHah, you just want to rub it in my face, huh? Sang Qian sneered in his mind, but on the surface, he maintained an amiable face as he went along with Shi Kun, \u201cWe\u2019re all working for the royal family. Allow me to propose a toast to Brother Shi with this cup of tea in place of wine. To our success!\u201d\u201cOf course, of course. To our success!\u201d Shi Kun lifted his teacup too and clinked it with Sang Qian\u2019s. However, he, too, had other thoughts in mind. You sure know how to phrase your words well. For the royal family, huh?In truth, the Sang clan was the aide of the emperor whereas the Shi clan was in the empress\u2019 faction. On the surface, it looked like the royal couple was on good terms with one another, but that was only because they had a common enemy at the moment\u2014King Qi.Who knew what would happen in the future? Naturally, they couldn\u2019t be too trusting of one another.Sang Qian also shared the same thoughts in mind.\u2026The following morning, Zu An was a lot calmer after having some time to cool down and think things through. In this world of cultivation, where strength determined almost everything, he should prioritize strength over his dignity.This world hadn\u2019t been very kind to him. Having been through numerous dangerous situations, he would rather obtain another means to ensure his safety than to stubbornly clutch onto his pride for practicing something a eunuch would. I mean, while it does sound bad that I\u2019m learning the Sunflower Manual, it\u2019s not as if people in this world have watched the Proud, Smiling Wanderer. What do I have to fear?Besides, he did need the Sunflower Phantasm, be it for tomorrow\u2019s Clans Tournament or entering the dungeon to unseal \u2018little Zu An\u2019.With such thoughts in mind, he began to study the Sunflower Phantasm once more, making careful sure to take note of every ki pathway.After breakfast, Chu Huanzhao knocked on his residence to go to the academy together. Zu An was initially quite resistant against the idea of going to the academy, but with such a beautiful sister-in-law escorting him, the notion of it wasn\u2019t that off-putting to him anymore.However, today was a little different since Chu Chuyan, for the first time in forever, was going to the academy too.Zu An felt that it was unfair how the perceptions between him and Chu Chuyan were vastly different. She hadn\u2019t been to the academy in ages, but everyone still treated her like a model student. On the other hand, if he simply skipped school for one day, others would take him as a hopeless delinquent.Due to Chu Chuyan\u2019s eye-catching appearance, she usually traveled around in a carriage. This way, it wouldn\u2019t cause unnecessary congestion on the street.Sitting on the soft cushion in the carriage and smelling the faint fragrance lingering in the air, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but recall the first time he rode on this carriage when he just arrived in the world. Many things had happened since then.\u201cHoney, do you still have any news about Snow?\u201d asked Zu An.The word \u2018honey\u2019 left Chu Chuyan with a helpless look on her face, as usual. She had tried to correct him several times now, but he simply refused to budge on this. Admittedly though, she was starting to get used to it too, so she ended up letting him have his way.\u201cI haven\u2019t found her yet. It\u2019s as if she has disappeared into thin air. Why? Do you miss her?\u201d\u201cI miss her?\u201d Zu An nearly leaped to his feet from sheer disbelief. \u201cThat woman tried to kill me multiple times! Do I look like a masochist to you? Why would I miss her?!\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, you mentioned that this wasn\u2019t the first time she tried to kill you. Why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201d asked Chu Chuyan.Zu An rolled his eyes. \u201cHow would I know who is the one trying to kill me here? She\u2019s your personal maidservant. What if you had some boy toy outside and wanted to kill me so that you could get together with him?\u201dChu Chuyan\u2019s cheeks flushed red. \u201cWhat do you mean by boy toy? You really should learn to keep your mouth in check!\u201d\u201cBrother-in-law, you sure are pitiful. You must have been incredibly worried during this period of time,\u201d Chu Huanzhao chirped in.Zu An felt a surge of warmth in his heart. He shot a glare at Chu Chuyan as he said, \u201cLook! It\u2019s my sister-in-law who cares the most about me in the end. You should learn more from her example!\u201dChu Huanzhao was oddly amused by that remark. Back at home, it had always been her parents telling her that she should learn from her big sister, but for the first time, someone was actually telling her big sister to learn from her instead. It felt not bad listening to those words.Chu Chuyan, on the other hand, disregarded his words and said, \u201cFeel free to tell me anything from now onward. We\u2019re a family now, though\u2026\u201dShe hesitantly shot a look at her little sister before eventually deciding not to say it. \u201c\u2026 In any case, I\u2019ll make sure to protect you well, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201dZu An\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect! If anyone dares to bully me from now onward, I\u2019ll make sure to summon you so that you can plant their heads into the ground!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Chuyan.\u201cI\u2019m not saying these just so that you can mess around.\u201d\u201cI know, I know~\u201d Zu An laughed. \u201cI must say though, your Chu clan isn\u2019t as formidable as I thought. Despite being a ducal clan, it can\u2019t even deal with a mere underworld sect. Heck, you can\u2019t even find a mere maidservant too. I really think you all should work on that.\u201dToward that, Chu Chuyan replied, \u201cYou\u2019re also a member of the Chu clan now. There are some things that I ought to tell you. While we\u2019re a ducal clan, our situation isn\u2019t as rosy as it looks from the outside. To be more direct, we\u2019re currently caught in the middle of the battle over the throne.\u201cAccording to the promise made by the preceding emperor, the crown should be passed on to King Qi, but His Majesty instead wishes to pass the position onto his own son, the current crown prince. Under normal circumstances, the officials are more inclined to respect His Majesty\u2019s decision, albeit grudgingly, as he\u2019s the only Earth Immortal stage cultivator at the moment. However, the problem is that the crown prince is far lacking in aptitude. He\u2019s nowhere close to matching King Qi.\u201cThere are already many officials and clans who were displeased with His Majesty for reneging on the promise back then, and the crown prince\u2019s insufficiency further deepened their disapproval. King Qi made use of this opportunity to rally these officials over to his side, resulting in two major factions in the royal court.\u201cAs powerful as His Majesty is, he\u2019s already old. At the same time, the crown prince is incompetent and unable to hold his own too. Due to that, the two factions are equally matched with one another. In order to break the tie, both actions are trying their best to win over all notable clans throughout the country. Our Chu clan governs the salt and arms trade in Brightmoon City, which makes us a key target for both factions.\u201cHowever, our Chu clan doesn\u2019t wish to get involved in this, which is why we refused to side with either of the factions. Our actions, in turn, frustrated both of the factions simultaneously. His Majesty is worried that we would choose to side with King Qi, so he appointed the Vice Minister of Finance, Sang Hong, as the governor of the Linchuan Commandery. In the first place, Sang Hong regulates the salt and arms trade, so this action could be said to be a move directed toward our Chu clan.\u201cCurrently, King Qi seems to be intending to watch from the sidelines. It\u2019s likely that he\u2019s waiting for us to be worn out from dealing with Sang Hong and the others before playing the good person and coax us into joining his faction. Speaking of which, the city lord of Brightmoon City is a member of King Qi\u2019s faction. You should have sensed it back at the casino too.\u201dZu An finally understood all of the complications involved here. That explains why no one seems to like me ever since I became the drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan, with some even openly coming after my life. I thought that they might be coveting Chu Chuyan\u2019s beauty, but it seems like it\u2019s the entire Chu clan they\u2019re after.1. Dongfang Bubai, one of the antagonists of the Proud Smiling Wanderer, is known to be quite an interesting queer character, and Sunflower Manual, who needs one to be castrated in order to practice, has been a thing of meme in China.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We mustn\u2019t show any opening for the enemies to strike,\u201d said Chu Chuyan worriedly.She, too, knew that there was no way to continuously fend against the schemes directed toward them. It was only a matter of time before they got careless and succumbed. However, there was no other choice here. They could only persevere on.Zu An couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Why do you insist on taking a neutral position? Wouldn\u2019t it be good to choose a faction to side with? At the very least, you wouldn\u2019t end up in this difficult position you\u2019re currently in.\u201dChu Chuyan shook her head and said, \u201cThe main issue here is that both factions are equally matched at the moment, so there\u2019s no way to know who\u2019ll have the last laugh. If we pick the wrong faction to work with, our Chu clan would be in dire straits. The neutral position might place us in a difficult position at the start, but as long as we toil it out until the end of the battle, it\u2019ll be all over. Whichever faction that won would need some time to recover, so they would willingly embrace any non-hostile powers. At the very least, this would ensure the survival of our Chu clan.\u201dZu An was amazed. Those who dabbled in politics sure were amazing. Even someone as honest as Chu Zhongtian was thinking several steps ahead here.Yup, I should be more careful. They\u2019re all cunning old foxes! Hmmm, didn\u2019t Pei Mianman sneak into the Chu clan to steal some accounting records a while back? I wonder which faction she\u2019s from\u2026It was then that the carriage suddenly came to a halt. A commotion sounded in front. With a frown, Chu Chuyan knocked on the wall of the carriage and asked, \u201cWhat happened outside?\u201dA guard of the Chu clan quickly answered, \u201cFirst Miss, it seems like the Sixth Young Master of the Shi clan is here. Many people have filled up the streets in order to throw flowers and fruits into his carriage. So, the road is a little congested now.\u201dZu An was perplexed. \u201cDoes he look like an ape or something? Why would so many people gather here to look at him, even throwing fruits into his carriage?\u201dThose words made Chu Chuyan smile in amusement. It was Chu Huanzhao who explained the situation to him, \u201cSilly brother-in-law. Haven\u2019t you heard of Shi Kun from the Shi clan?\u201d\u201cIs he very famous?\u201d Zu An asked. \u201cNo one has ever gathered around to give me flowers even though I\u2019m a famous figure in Brightmoon City too.\u201dEven Chu Huanzhao found it hard to swallow those words. She rolled her eyes and said, \u201cYours is more of notoriety than fame. His reputation is far better than yours. The Sixth Young Master of the Shi clan is known for his good looks. Have you ever heard of the story of \u2018welcoming a carriage with fruits and flowers\u2019?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Zu An was confused. What the hell is that?So, Chu Huanzhao began on a long story, \u201cIt\u2019s said that the Sixth Young Master of the Shi clan has a beautiful appearance and a graceful demeanor. In his earlier years, whenever he toured around the streets of the capital, even old ladies would find themselves infatuated with him and toss fruits into his carriage, filling it up. Upon hearing the story, another young master also emulated Shi Kun\u2019s example and drove his carriage around too, only to have the women of the capital fill his carriage up with spit.\u201cThat should give an idea of how good-looking Shi Kun is. I thought that the story was just a rumor, but it seems like it\u2019s real.\u201d\u201cIs it really that exaggerated?\u201d The excited look on Chu Huanzhao face displeased Zu An.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t miss this opportunity. I should head out to see how dashing that man is!\u201d Chu Huanzhao got to her feet and prepared to dive out of the carriage, only to be stopped by her older sister.Chu Chuyan remarked calmly, \u201cThe Shi clan belongs to the empress\u2019 faction. It\u2019s best for you not to come into contact with him.\u201dZu An nodded vehemently in agreement with Chu Chuyan\u2019s remarks. He shot a glare at Chu Huanzhao and said, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s only right for your parents to constantly nag at you. When will you learn to become more mature like your older sister?\u201dDisappointed, Chu Huanzhao sank back into her seat. She harrumphed with a pout, \u201cBrother-in-law, you\u2019re just jealous.\u201dZu An straightened his posture and said, \u201cNo matter how handsome he is, could he possibly be more handsome than me? It should be enough for you to look at me!\u201dThose words tinged Chu Huanzhao\u2019s face in redness. She turned her head away and murmured, \u201cShameless~\u201dIt was then that a gentle voice suddenly sounded from outside. \u201cIs it Miss Chu inside? Shi Kun from the capital wishes to meet you.\u201dDreamy exclamations immediately sounded outside.\u201cWaaaaa~ If only young master Shi would ask me out on a date like this!\u201d\u201cTsk, you should take a look at the mirror. Do you think you\u2019re worthy?\u201d\u201cAs if you\u2019re pretty yourself.\u201d\u201cStop arguing. None of you can possibly compete with Chu First Miss when it comes to looks!\u201d\u201cTsk. No matter how pretty she is, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s already married. I\u2019ve been protecting his chastity well for young master Shi\u2019s sake!\u201d\u2026The discussions coming from all around provoked Zu An\u2019s curiosity. He parted the carriage\u2019s curtains a little and saw a few women swooning on the spot. Haa, I thought that I would be able to see some beautiful women out there. It turns out that they\u2019re all just old hags. They aren\u2019t even close to matching my wife!Looks like that young master Shi doesn\u2019t look as suave as the rumors put him out to be.With such thoughts in mind, Zu An turned his gaze frontward, and he caught sight of something that nearly bedazzled his eyes blind. It was a refined man with looks so dashing that one could probably sing praises of him for an hour straight!Too freaking handsome!Even Zu An had no choice but to acknowledge this. In terms of appearance, the other party was nearly a match for him. However, women lacked the ability to accurately gauge how handsome a man is, so he worriedly turned his gaze back into the carriage to look at Chu Chuyan.Unexpectedly, Chu Chuyan looked perfectly calm, barely reacting at all. She replied calmly, \u201cMy apologies, but it\u2019s inconvenient for a married woman like me to meet with another man privately. I beg your pardon, young master Shi.\u201dAfter saying her piece, she gestured for the coach to set off.Zu An was so delighted to hear those words that he felt tempted to rush forward and give his wife a tight hug. All along, he thought that his wife treated him so coldly because she looked down on him, but it turned out that she was impartial to everyone!In fact, it could be said that she treats me fairly well.\u2026Meanwhile, on the streets, Shi Kun looked at the departing carriage with a hint of anger on his beautiful face. The hands hidden within his sleeves clenched tightly together. Chu Chuyan, just you wait. You\u2019ll be mine soon!His awful complexion couldn\u2019t escape the notice of his surrounding fans. Those women continued gossiping amongst them once more.\u201cThat Chu woman sure is insolent. How dare she snub our young master Shi like this?\u201d\u201cYou can do that if you\u2019re pretty enough too.\u201d\u201cHmph! I wouldn\u2019t snub our young master Shi no matter how pretty I am!\u201d\u201cIndeed! Why is she putting on airs for? In the end, she still married a wastrel for a husband. I might not be able to win her in anyone else, but at the very least, I\u2019ll find a husband superior to hers!\u201dOf course, there were some who meekly pointed out, \u201cYoung master Shi had a frightening look in his eyes for a moment earlier\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, such words of dissension were swiftly drowned out by the other fans. \u201cWhat do you know? That\u2019s what we call \u2018devilish charms\u2019! That\u2019s a unique disposition that only our young master Shi has!\u201d\u2026In the carriage, Chu Chuyan was starting to feel uncomfortable under Zu An\u2019s intent stare. She couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dZu An replied with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, honey. I think I\u2019m growing fonder and fonder of you.\u201dChu Huanzhao couldn\u2019t bear this atmosphere. \u201cHey hey hey, there\u2019s a child in here. Please control yourselves, alright?\u201dZu An was rendered speechless. I mean, it\u2019s true that you\u2019re young, but to call yourself a child seems to be going too far, no?\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. I didn\u2019t turn down the young master of the Shi clan for you. I simply didn\u2019t want to get involved with the Shi clan,\u201d replied Chu Chuyan.That didn\u2019t dampen Zu An\u2019s joy though. \u201cRegardless of the reason, I\u2019m quite happy that you rejected him.\u201dChu Chuyan was a little stifled. She felt like her point wasn\u2019t getting across to Zu An properly. After a moment of contemplation, she decided to put it out even more clearly, \u201cWhile I do identify myself as your wife outside, we\u2019re both aware what\u2019s going on in our marriage. It\u2019s impossible for me to fulfill my responsibilities as your wife. So, I hope that you won\u2019t get too involved in this relationship lest you get hurt in the future.\u201dChu Huanzhao felt deeply pitiful for Zu An when she heard those words. While there were plenty of speculations regarding this going around the Chu Estate, it was completely different hearing it coming right out of her big sister\u2019s mouth. My brother-in-law must be really depressed to hear those words.Unexpectedly, that still didn\u2019t dampen Zu An\u2019s joy. \u201cI know. However, whether I like you or not is my own business. It has nothing to do with whether you like me or not. Besides, who knows? You might just fall for me in the future.\u201dChu Chuyan shook her head without a shred of hesitation. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201dZu An shrugged casually, thinking nothing of it. \u201cSince you\u2019ve already put it out like that, I think that I should clarify another matter too. If you don\u2019t intend to fulfill your responsibilities as my wife, would you mind if I look for other women?\u201dChu Huanzhao was still grieving for Zu An a moment ago when she suddenly heard this question. Her eyes immediately widened in shock. You horrible brother-in-law! My big sister will teach you a lesson for daring to cheat on her!Chu Chuyan was equally surprised too. She hadn\u2019t expected to hear such a question from Zu An, but she still answered calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s just that you\u2026\u201dHer gaze slowly traced downward to Zu An\u2019s crotch. As her little sister was in the carriage too, she chose not to say it out loud.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. I should be able to recover in due time!\u201d Zu An patted his chest proudly. It was not that he was confident in finding the Evanescent Lotus, but his lack of it didn\u2019t hinder him from putting on a strong front before Chu Chuyan.Chu Chuyan also chose not to say anything about it. She thought that he was trying to turn his eyes away from the cruel reality.On the other hand, Chu Huanzhao\u2019s lower jaws slackened. What in the world is going on here? As if it wanted ridiculous for my brother-in-law to ask my big sister if he could cheat on her, my big sister didn\u2019t get angry at all and even said that she was fine with it?Big sister, you must be unaware that my brother-in-law is far more outstanding than you know! If you release your grip on him, all of those vixens out there would surely snatch him from your hands!No, this won\u2019t do. I need to help my big sister keep him in check!With different thoughts in the minds of the trio in the carriage, they soon arrived in the academy. The academy had a rule where students couldn\u2019t ride their carriage into the academy, so they alighted at the entrance.Chu Chuyan\u2019s appearance immediately stirred a commotion in the surroundings, with many thanking the heaven above for allowing them to catch a sight of this elusive top beauty of the Sweetheart Ranking.However, when the crowd saw Zu An alighting from the same carriage too, they suddenly felt a huge outburst of envy. They were reminded of the fact that their goddess was already married to a good-for-nothing, and their moods were immediately spoiled.\u201cWhat a coincidence. I didn\u2019t expect to meet Chu First Miss here too,\u201d a familiar voice sounded.Zu An turned over to take a look, only to see Shi Kun standing not too far away. The latter had a dashing smile on his face, but in Zu An\u2019s opinion, it only looked irritating.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just look at his dashing appearance! Even I can\u2019t help but want to dote on him!\u201d\u201cIs that so? He doesn\u2019t look as handsome as the rumors put him out to be. I mean, even young master Xie of our academy doesn\u2019t pale in comparison to him.\u201d\u201cHmph, don\u2019t talk about that trash of a man. How can that bastard be put on the same pedestal as young master Shi?\u201d\u2026A group of passing female students began swooning over Shi Kun.\u201cHeh, women,\u201d remarked Zu An in scorn.Shi Kun was accompanied by quite a few people at the moment. Most of them were unfamiliar faces to Zu An, but some of them happened to be people whom he recognized, such as Yuan Wendong and Ye Chenliang.Yuan Wendong had always carried himself as if he was the king of the world or something. However, his usual arrogance was nowhere to be seenat the moment. He followed Shi Kun with a smile on his face, looking pretty desperate to fawn on the latter.Ye Chenliang was even worse. His attitude could be effectively described with the word \u2018bootlicking\u2019.The world is such a pragmatic place, huh?Having seen plenty of this in his previous world, Zu An couldn\u2019t help but sigh deeply.Chu Huanzhao also shot a look at Shi Kun before murmuring softly, \u201cI thought that he would be really handsome, but he looks not much different from my brother-in-law.\u201dZu An\u2019s face darkened. Is she trying to compliment or insult me?Shi Kun began walking toward them with a disarming smile, which ironically only made Chu Chuyan frown. She was about to say something, but he quickly interjected, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for Chu First Miss to call me \u2018another man\u2019 on the street, but now that we\u2019re in the academy, I should be considered as your classmate of yours too, right? I shouldn\u2019t just be \u2018another man\u2019 now anymore.\u201dShi Kun\u2019s polite attitude left Chu Chuyan with no room to reject him. She nodded her head slightly and said, \u201cYes, I understand.\u201dLooking at the white-robed fairy before him, Shi Kun was mesmerized. There had been many beauties who had actively offered themselves to him, some even coming from prominent backgrounds, but none of them could match Chu Chuyan. Her ravishing looks and her lofty disposition gave her an ethereal atmosphere, as if a goddess from heaven.\u201cI must get her!\u201dShi Kun\u2019s desire was growing stronger with each passing moment.He put on an impeccable smile that tingled the hearts of the female students around and said, \u201cMiss Chu, this is actually not our first meeting.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Chu Chuyan was surprised to hear that. \u201cPardon my ignorance, but I don\u2019t recall having met you anywhere.\u201d\u201cAround seven years ago, in the capital, I had the honor of catching a glimpse of your visage across a pond during a gathering. Words couldn\u2019t begin to describe how enchanted I was. It\u2019s a pity that you were already gone by the time I arrived. It\u2019s been a regret lingering in my heart since then. I\u2019ve been trying to find the whereabouts of the fairy I saw over the years, but to no avail. It looks like heaven has finally taken pity on me to bestow upon me the fate to encounter you once more.\u201d\u201cWaaa! I never thought that young master Shi would be such a devoted man!\u201d\u201cIf he had said those words to me, I think I'd faint from bliss.\u201d\u201cYeah~ I thought that men with good looks were all philanderers, just like Xie Xiu, but who could have thought that he would stay true to his feelings!\u201d\u2026Zu An felt burning flames of rage sprouting in his heart. These lovestruck bimbos! Why are they getting so excited over a couple of words? At this rate, even if he shits in front of you all, you\u2019d still find a way to compliment him!Throughout this entire duration, Shi Kun had been disregarding his presence to devote words of affection toward his wife. Without a doubt, there was no man in the world who could tolerate this.Zu An walked right in front of Chu Chuyan and said, \u201cBrother Shit Kun, I believe that there\u2019s something very wrong with what you\u2019ve said.\u201d\u201cShit Kun?\u201d Shi Kun\u2019s face immediately darkened in fury. \u201cWho are you calling Shit Kun? It\u2019s Shi Kun!\u201dYou have successfully trolled Shi Kun for +315 Rage!\u201cAlright alright, Brother Shit Kun.\u201d Zu An shrugged off Shi Kun\u2019s words nonchalantly. \u201cBased on what I have just heard from you, basically, after catching a glimpse of her a few years ago, you decided to hunt her down like a stalker. If so, can you really call this meeting the work of fate?\u201d\u201cWho are you? Why should I answer your question?\u201d Shi Kun harrumphed coldly.It went without saying that he knew who Zu An was. However, given his standing, the best way to deal with Zu An was to simply disregard his presence.\u201cAh, you don\u2019t know who I am? I guess there\u2019s a need for a formal introduction then.\u201d Zu An reached out to grab Chu Chuyan\u2019s hand. \u201cI am the husband of the goddess whom you dream day and night of. You spend your time fantasizing about her, but I\u2019m spared from the effort of having to rely on my imagination. The two of us share a bed after all. Is that enough for an introduction?\u201dHaving her hand suddenly grabbed sent a jolt throughout Chu Chuyan\u2019s body. She instinctively wanted to pull her hand out from Zu An\u2019s grasp, but she knew that doing so would embarrass him in front of the crowd they were before.Besides, her very purpose of marrying Zu An was to sever the royal family and King Qi\u2019s thoughts of pursuing a political marriage with the Chu clan. If she were to indicate that the two of them were not close with one another at this juncture, all of her efforts would have been in vain.With such considerations in mind, she could only silently permit him to hold her hand. Zu An seemed to have also predicted this, and that was why he dared to do it in the first place.It was just that Chu Chuyan didn\u2019t expect Zu An\u2019s words to be so venomous. The crude terms he used left her ears reddening despite her cold personality. Is he taking advantage of me because he knows that I wouldn\u2019t refute him?Understandably, a huge uproar broke out amidst the spectating crowd. They knew that Chu Chuyan and Zu An were wedded, but they consoled themselves by thinking that she had other intentions in mind for marrying a good-for-nothing and that it was unlikely that she would let him take advantage of her. Perhaps, they might not have even sealed their nuptial night yet.However, Zu An\u2019s words had broken all of their fantasies. To make things worse, Chu First Miss revealed an embarrassed face but didn\u2019t deny anything at all. My gosh, I\u2019m going insane!Just thinking about how the number one beauty of Brightmoon City was pinned under a man like Zu An\u2026 Countless people immediately went bonkers with envy.You have successfully trolled Gao Ren for +444 Rage!You have successfully trolled He Buyu for +444 Rage!You have successfully trolled Wu Zhenjian for +444 Rage!\u2026The massive influx of Rage points soothed Zu An\u2019s heart, leaving him feeling greatly heartened. Just like the novels he had read in his previous life, it was easy to incur the ire of anyone as long as a beauty was involved!It looks like I must work hard in this direction. I need to get more beautiful women\u2026 Ah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m a pervert, but I simply want to earn more Rage points.Shi Kun glanced at the tightly grasped hands between the two, and his cheeks began twitching. One must know that he had always viewed Chu Chuyan to be his own personal possession, but she actually got touched by another man! Even if it was just her hand, it was more than enough to make his rage flurry.You have successfully trolled Shi Kun for +520 Rage!\u201cZu An, based on what I know, you and Chu First Miss sleep in separate rooms. She doesn\u2019t even allow you to enter her room, let alone share the same bed. How laughable it is that I\u2019m hearing such words from you.\u201d Shi Kun harrumphed coldly.Zu An, on the other hand, was appalled. How does he know that we\u2019re sleeping in separate rooms? Then, a thought came to his mind, and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall mentioning my name at any point while introducing myself as Chuyan\u2019s husband. How did you know that my name is Zu An then? It can\u2019t be that you have sent spies into our Chu clan, right? It just so happens that we had a traitor by the name of Snow recently. Is it possible that you\u2019re the mastermind behind her?\u201dChu Chuyan immediately directed eyes of suspicion toward Shi Kun. If the Chu clan was unable to find the mastermind behind Snow despite the influence it possessed, the mastermind was likely to be of high standing. Shi Kun happened to fulfill the criterion.\u201cRubbish! How would I know what Snow or Winter? Stop slandering me!\u201d Shi Kun refuted it vehemently right away. He didn\u2019t expect Zu An to be so sharp. \u201cAs for your name, it\u2019s public knowledge that Chu First Miss is married. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that I know your name.\u201dZu An harrumphed in response. \u201cSince you do know me, why did you feign ignorance earlier then? It looks like beneath your pretty face lies a hypocritical heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shi Kun.You have successfully trolled Shi Kun for +300 Rage!Zu An carried on, \u201cAlso, given your \u2018lofty\u2019 personality, you would simply snort off my accusations and ignore me? It\u2019s such a surprise to see you desperately trying to refute the words of a nobody like me. Is that a guilty conscience there I spot?\u201dThe crowd nodded in agreement. As hateful as Zu An was, there was logic in his words. This was indeed at odds with young master Shi\u2019s personality. Could he really be having a guilty conscience?Shi Kun didn\u2019t expect Zu An to have set a trap for him to leap into. He finally understood how Mei Chaofeng and Snow felt dealing with this guy. He couldn\u2019t help but begrudge Snow. Why didn\u2019t you kill this disgustingly reprehensible man earlier?!He took a deep breath to calm himself down before ignoring Chu Chuyan, \u201cChu First Miss, please don\u2019t allow his words to affect the good ties between the Chu clan and Shi clan. I\u2019m honestly unaware of the affairs that have transpired in your estate, and it has nothing to do with the Shi clan.\u201dChu Chuyan had already come to a judgment about this matter, and she replied calmly, \u201cI hope so. Our Chu clan might not be a prominent clan, but we wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to take advantage of us either.\u201dShi Kun laughed it off awkwardly, \u201cChu First Miss, you\u2019re jesting with me. A ducal clan like yours is indubitably a prominent clan. Besides, I\u2019ve admired you for a long time now. I wouldn\u2019t do anything that would harm you.\u201dBefore Chu Chuyan could respond, Zu An had already cut right in, \u201cAh, that reminds me. You mentioned that you met my wife a few years ago, and she has been lingering in your dreams since then. You didn\u2019t expect to meet her in Brightmoon Academy, and you feel that it\u2019s the work of fate, right?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Shi Kun harrumphed coldly. \u201cChu First Miss hasn\u2019t married you yet, so what\u2019s wrong with me admiring her? After so many years, my feelings for her have already become deeply rooted in my heart. I know that she\u2019s married, but I can\u2019t control my heart. Chu First Miss, I beg your pardon for that.\u201dPlaying the sentimental man here, huh? Zu An sneered coldly. There were plenty of PUA lessons on the web in his previous life. As a proud keyboard warrior, how could he be unaware of them?\u201cOh? That\u2019s quite weird. I recall hearing that the Shi clan is a prominent clan in the capital, and it has many connections at its disposal. Chuyan isn\u2019t some nobody either; she\u2019s the First Miss of the Chu clan! Even if you just asked those who were in the area back then, there would surely be some who knew of her identity. Yet, you claimed that you couldn\u2019t find her all this while, only to say that to put on an \u2018it\u2019s fate that brought us together\u2019 act here. At this point, I honestly can\u2019t tell whether you have malicious intentions in mind or that you\u2019re just plain incompetent.\u201d1.

Despite his careful maneuvers, he realized that he had still fallen into Zu An\u2019s trap.If he said that he failed to find Chu Chuyan, it would be admitting that he was incompetent. If he said that he did, that would mean that it was a deliberate ploy on his part to feign a coincidental meeting with her. Neither of them was acceptable to him.Fortunately, someone stepped forward then to alleviate the awkward situation\u2014Yuan Wendong. \u201cZu An, it looks like the time you spent loitering around the street has taught you how to quibble with others. Who do you think young master Shi is? A gentleman like him wouldn\u2019t argue with others, so it\u2019s only natural that he\u2019s unable to one-up you in an argument. Besides, how could young master Shi possibly be incompetent?\u201cThere\u2019s no one who hasn\u2019t heard of young master Shi\u2019s talents. He\u2019s known to be a prodigy in cultivation, and it\u2019s said that he\u2019s already on the verge of reaching the sixth rank despite his young age. On the other hand, what are you good at? Mooching off women? Bicker like a common hoodlum?\u201dShi Kun\u2019s entourage immediately burst into laughter. They were making use of this opportunity to help him vent his anger.Zu An looked at Yuan Wendong with a tilted head and asked, \u201cYou must be very fond of bones?\u201dYuan Wendong thought that Zu An would fly into a state of rage and reveal his unsightly side, yet he was met with such a nonchalant response instead. Caught off guard, he ended up subconsciously responding, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dA young master of a wealthy clan like him had no lack of delicacies on his table. Why would he bother biting bones?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why do you keep wagging your tail before Shi Kun as if you\u2019re begging him for a reward?\u201d replied Zu An contemptuously. \u201cWe had our differences the last time we met, but your guts was still respectable. But where have your pride and honor gone? Even I\u2019m starting to feel embarrassed on your behalf!\u201d\u201cYou are really\u2026\u201d Yuan Wendong\u2019s face reddened in anger. He never thought that Zu An would actually lay a trap for him, and he even foolishly jumped into it on his own accord!You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for +888 Rage!Most importantly of all, what Zu An said wasn\u2019t wrong. He used to be the star of the academy, having countless people fawning on him. He wasn\u2019t used to his new role, but there was no helping it since the Shi clan was simply massive. Thus, despite his discomfort, he was still trying his best to please Shi Kun.Thus, having Zu An point it out in public was like a tight slap to his face. It left him feeling so humiliated that he would dive right into a hole if there was one in front of him.\u201cBrother Yuan, please do not mind him. This fellow knows nothing but to engage in meaningless quibble. You mustn\u2019t lower yourself to his level,\u201d Shi Kun caringly consoled him.Yuan Wendong looked at Shi Kun in gratitude for helping him defuse the awkwardness. He quickly snapped out of his daze and gritted his teeth angrily at Zu An. \u201cYoung master Shi is right! You know nothing but to engage in meaningless quibble! This is the world of cultivation. If you\u2019re that capable, why don\u2019t you have a battle with me? I\u2019ll beat you up to the point that you mother doesn\u2019t even recognize you anymore!\u201dZu An immediately retreated behind Chu Chuyan and said, \u201cHoney, that fellow dared to threaten me. Beat him up!\u201dChu Chuyan felt a headache setting in. I have really chosen the wrong husband here. This fellow really knows how to stir trouble.However, recalling their purpose here today, she went along with him and said, \u201cYuan Wendong, no matter what, Zu An is still the son-in-law of our Chu clan. I can\u2019t allow outsiders to take advantage of him. If you want to challenge him, you have to get past me first.\u201dAs Chu Chuyan took a step forward, Yuan Wendong subconsciously took a step back. If I had the ability to defeat you, do you think I would have to lower my back here and fawn on Shi Kun?But of course, there was no way he would dare to rage at Chu Chuyan, so he firmly kept his eyes on Zu An and said, \u201cZu wastrel, how kind of man are you to hide behind a woman\u2019s back every time something happens?\u201dJust thinking how he was brutally defeated by Pei Mianman the previous time was enough to make his face turn dark.Zu An shrugged in response, saying, \u201cIf I, who managed to get so many beautiful and powerful women on my side, am not considered a man, what does someone who couldn\u2019t even find a single woman like you count as then?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yuan Wendong was at a loss for words. Why the hell am I feeling so stifled?!You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for +642 Rage!It was then that Shi Kun muttered something, and Yuan Wendong\u2019s eyes lit up. A gleeful smile crept into his eyes as he replied, \u201cBe gleeful all you want now. You might be able to hide behind a woman now, but let\u2019s see what you can do at tomorrows\u2019 Clans Tournament!\u201dZu An sighed deeply. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re a sucker for pain, huh? You really want to have the living daylights beaten out of you. Oh well, forget it, I shall put away the act now. I\u2019ll let you show my true prowess at tomorrow\u2019s Clans Tournament. Just try to hold back your tears then, alright?\u201d\u201cYour true prowess?\u201d Yuan Wendong began laughing so hard that his back began arching backward. \u201cVery well, I\u2019d love to see young master Zu\u2019s incredible strength tomorrow! Hahahahaha!\u201dShi Kun also had a satisfied smile on his face. According to Snow\u2019s testimony, Zu An was only a third rank cultivator. No matter how powerful he was, there was no way he could defeat a fifth rank cultivator like Yuan Wendong.Of course, in order to ensure that things didn\u2019t go wrong, he would make sure to remind Yuan Wendong about Zu An\u2019s true strength.\u201cI can even tell you frankly right now that I\u2019ll be the last one up as the Chu clan\u2019s secret weapon. I hope that you won\u2019t coward out at the last moment!\u201d said Zu An.Yuan Wendong laughed. \u201cRest assured, I\u2019ll show you the true meaning of despair then!\u201dHe could see through the Chu clan\u2019s intention. Most likely, they were putting Zu An at the very back in order to protect him. By then, if victory had already been decided, there would be no need for him to fight anymore. Hmph, did you think that our Yuan clan is still the same as before? Just be prepared to have the shock of your life!Watching how Zu An was making a big hoo-ha over everything right now, Yuan Wendong couldn\u2019t imagine just how ridiculous the other party would look when he was forced onto the dueling ring tomorrow. It excited him just to think about it.This idiot!This was Yuan Wendong\u2019s evaluation of Zu An.On the other hand, seeing that their goal had been achieved, Chu Chuyan quickly pulled Zu An away from the scene. Shi Kun froze up a little upon seeing that sight.Chu Chuyan and Zu An\u2019s relationship doesn\u2019t seem as stale as Snow put it out to be. Could they have gotten closer to one another during this period of time?Feeling as if he had been cuckolded, Shi Kun felt rage boiling in his blood.You have successfully trolled Shi Kun for +222 Rage!Meanwhile, Zu An was in no mood to care about the Rage points he was receiving at the System. He was focused on Chu Chuyan\u2019s hand, which felt cooling, soft, and smooth on touch. He was a little delighted that the latter had taken the initiative to grab his hand this time around.However, as soon as they were out of the crowd, Chu Chuyan released her grip and said, \u201cYou did well earlier. You managed to stir his rage. It\u2019s very likely that he would choose you tomorrow.\u201dZu An was also pleased with his performance. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident in my ability to infuriate others after all.\u201d\u201cYes, I can tell.\u201d Thinking about how Snow was often left fuming in his wake, a smile broke out on Chu Chuyan\u2019s face.Chu Huanzhao, on the other hand, was still worried about this matter. \u201cBig sister, what if Zu An really finds himself in a position where he needs to fight Yuan Wendong? Yuan Wendong is a fifth rank cultivator, and he hates Zu An with a passion now. It\u2019s almost certain that he would take advantage of the duel to hurt Zu An!\u201dToward that, Chu Chuyan answered, \u201cRest assured. Based on our arrangements, the battle should be decided in the first few rounds. Zu An wouldn\u2019t even have to fight at all.\u201d\u201cBut what if things go wrong?\u201d Chu Huanzhao asked anxiously.\u201cIf things don\u2019t go according to plan, Zu An should just admit defeat right away. Besides, my father and I will be watching by the side. We won\u2019t allow anything to happen to him,\u201d replied Chu Chuyan.Chu Huanzhao frowned. \u201cStill, Zu An has already challenged Yuan Wendong publicly. If he admits defeat right away on the dueling ring, how can he face anyone else in the future?\u201d\u201cIs his dignity or his life more important?\u201d asked Chu Chuyan.After saying those words, she turned to Zu An and said, \u201cRegarding that, I should also give you a warning. I realized that you have a tendency to provoke others. You have been able to remain safe thus far mostly due to luck, but your luck will eventually run out. You really should make some changes to your personality. Otherwise, you might just regret it if you offend someone you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cRest assured, I only offend people whom I can afford to offend,\u201d replied Zu An. If I don\u2019t offend others, how do I get my Rage points? Besides, it\u2019s not like I indiscriminately anger everyone around me. I\u2019d never offended someone whom I can\u2019t afford to.To date, Zu An had never tried to earn Old Mi or Ji Dengtu\u2019s Rage points, and it was for a good reason why he chose to do so. While it looked like he had been living recklessly so far, in truth, it was all calculated risk.Of course, once my little Zu An is released, I\u2019ll find an opportunity to get even with Ji Dengtu. Hmph!However, Chu Chuyan took his words differently. She thought that he was disregarding her kind advice, and she couldn\u2019t help but sigh softly. It seems like there\u2019s no use persuading him.\u201cI\u2019ll head to my classroom. We\u2019ll meet after school.\u201d Leaving those words behind, Chu Chuyan walked away with a heavy heart.Once she was gone, Chu Huanzhao heaved a deep sigh of relief and said, \u201cOof, I feel so stifled! There were so many times that I nearly succumbed and told her about it!\u201dZu An looked at Chu Huanzhao and asked curiously, \u201cIs it really good for you to team up with me to fool your big sister?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more interesting this way, right? Bwahahaha!\u201d Chu Huanzhao let out a villainous laugh. \u201cShe even said that she\u2019d meet you after school. I wonder how she would react when she sees you in the classroom.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also quite curious to know too.\u201d Zu An was also hyped up by Chu Huanzhao\u2019s remarks. \u201cWhat do you think I should say when I meet her in the classroom later on in order to make the scene even more dramatic?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that your field of specialty? Why are you asking me instead?\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed. \u201cJust look at Yuan Wendong and Ye Chenliang! I reckon that there\u2019s no one better than you at teasing others!\u201d\u201cAwww, you\u2019re flattering me. I\u2019m usually quite honest, y\u2019know.\u201d Zu An was starting to feel a bit embarrassed by her flattery.\u201d\u201cHonest?\u201d Chu Huanzhao looked at him with an enigmatic smile on her lips. \u201cDid you think that I never caught you eyeing my legs from time to time? Confess! You\u2019ve actually thought of taking the two of us sisters as your wives before, right?\u201d\u201cNo no, definitely not!\u201d Zu An was shocked by the thought. Isn\u2019t Chu Huanzhao a little too gutsy to ask such a question directly?\u201cTsk! You think I don\u2019t know what you men are always thinking about?\u201d Chu Huanzhao harrumphed coldly. \u201cYou better not let my mother or my big sister know that you harbor such thoughts, or else they\u2019ll skin you alive!\u201dAfter saying those words, she began skipping toward her classroom, leaving a dumbfounded Zu An in her wake.Wait a moment, what does she even mean by those words?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
