    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - The Hall of MourningA funerary hall.A bronze coffin lay in the center of the room, its surface engraved with all manner of birds, beasts, insects, and fish, as well as the boundless and ancient patterns of the sun, moon, and stars.A young woman clad in pristine white silk, too beautiful for this world, knelt before the coffin.Outside the hall of mourning was a world like a hidden realm, reminiscent of the pure lands of the Western Paradise.Terrifying figures, like heavenly gods and buddhas, were engaged in vicious slaughter.Furious howls filled the air.Divine blood fell like rain.Yet, the interior of the hall of mourning was utterly silent.From beginning to end, the young woman knelt with her head to the ground, her expression neither sorrowful nor joyful. She was utterly calm, without the slightest ripple of emotion.\u201cHah\u2026. So\u00a0this\u00a0is what it's like after you \u2018die\u2019.....\u201d Su Yi smiled, but his eyes were utterly cold.Only when his gaze landed on the young woman did his eyes reveal a nigh-indiscernible hint of gentleness.In life, he\u2019d once roamed the surrounding void, visiting its various divinities. His sword had suppressed the starry sky, and he'd arbitrated an entire great realm.He\u2019d once conquered the world, becoming the absolute hegemon of his era.He\u2019d once been honored as the Nine Provinces of Wilds\u2019 one and only \u201cMaster of Ten Thousand Daos.\u201dIn the eyes of the Nine Provinces\u2019 expert swordmasters, he was a peerless expert in the way of the blade, the \u201cSwordmaster of Abstruse Force.\u201dBut when word of his death spread, everything changed!\u201cHa ha ha, \u2018smelting fate and refining the grand dao\u2019? From now on, Su Xuanjun\u2019s \u2018Heaven-Smelting Furnace\u2019 belongs to me!\u201d A burst of laughter rang out from the hidden world beyond the hall of mourning. The sound carried both delight and pleasure.Su Yi glanced over.It was a Golden-Winged Great Peng, its wings so massive, they were like clouds blotting out the skies. Its feathers had a dazzling sheen, as if they were drenched in golden sap. Its unmatched radiance spread through the skies, the sheer majesty flattening the mountains and rivers on one side.It clutched a bright, fiery red cauldron in its enormous, heaven-rending claws.\u201cEven that little sparrow\u2019s betrayed me now\u2026.\u201d Su Yi sighed in lament.He vividly remembered that, eighty thousand years ago, the Golden-Winged Great Peng had knelt outside his mountain gate, kowtowing for ten days and ten nights, all for the sake of serving beneath him and hearing his insights into the Dao.Out of consideration for its sincerity, he\u2019d allowed the bird to cultivate by his side.Yet now, here it was, calling him directly by name and stealing his Heaven-Smelting Furnace.A blatant traitor!\u201cSu Xuanjun owes my Levitating Sword Hall eight hundred and ninety-three lives. Moreover, he stole our sect\u2019s highest inheritance, the \u2018Ten Directions Sword Sutra.\u2019 Today, we\u2019re here to reclaim what\u2019s rightfully ours, and we\u2019ll kill anyone who stands in our way!\u201dThunder rumbled beneath the dome of heaven. A daoist clad in red robes howled with harrowing murderous intent.Su Yi was stunned.The Levitating Sword Hall had once been a small, unknown sect.\u00a0Its patriarch was but one of his thirty-six disciples-in-name.And it was precisely because he\u2019d relied upon Su Xuanjun\u2019s prestige and protection that the Levitating Sword Hall gradually rose to prominence and became one of the Wilds\u2019 Nine Provinces\u2019 Six Great Daoist Sects, shaking the entire world.Yet now, the Levitating Sword Hall was here too.What \u201cowing them eight hundred and ninety-three lives\u201d? That was pure, unadulterated nonsense.And don\u2019t even mention the \u201cTen Directions Sword Sutra.\u201d He\u2019d bequeathed it upon the Levitating Sword Hall\u2019s patriarch personally!Clearly, upon hearing word of his death, the Levitating Sword Hall had casually come up with an excuse to raid his possessions. All that talk of \u201cdebts\u201d was nothing but a pretense.\u201cPublic morality has degenerated. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. Despite himself, his heart sank.In all his years of life, he\u2019d never once mistreated those close to him!Amidst the bloody rain, a grand procession of divinities shouted, \u201cListen up! All of us once revered Su Xuanjun as \u2018the Master of Ten Thousand Daos\u2019. Today, so long as there is breath in our bodies, we won\u2019t allow you to exploit his misfortune and seize his possessions!\u201d\u201cNonsense! You make it sound so righteous, but aren\u2019t you here to fight for Old Thief Su\u2019s treasures too?\u201cHow frickin\u2019 hypocritical!\u201dSome people laughed coldly. Others responded with mockery.\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got in your hands? Immortal Ivy, the Illustrious Scepter, the Nine Lanterns of the Dragon God, the Glazed Jade Flask\u2026. Which of them isn\u2019t one of the \u2018peerless magic treasures\u2019 Su Xuanjun left behind?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re so sincere, why not place them into his coffin to accompany him to the grave?\u201d\u2026..Numerous terrifying figures burst into cold laughter.Heaven and earth were in turmoil, and the battle raged on.The combatants were all peak-level experts, major powers of the Wilds\u2019 Nine Provinces. The sight of them fighting and killing each other was too terrifying for words.But in Su Yi\u2019s eyes, it was ludicrous, even comical!These scoundrels! During his life, they'd been blindly subservient, reverent, and respectful.Yet they turned around and acted like this the moment they found out he was \u201cdead\u201d!\u201cEverything really is different after you die.\u201d Su Yi looked away, then fixed his gaze on the girl kneeling before his coffin. His expression softened. \u201cAt least Qing Tang is still here\u2026.\u201dQing Tang had cultivated by his side since she was thirteen years old. Eighteen thousand, nine hundred years had passed since then. Within the Wilds\u2019 Nine Provinces, she was known as \u201cEmpress Qing Tang.\u201dIn the eyes of outsiders, she was a lofty figure, an empress who reigned over all nations. Her prestige and authority suppressed the Nine Provinces, and even others of her cultivation held her in awe.But to Su Yi, she\u2019d always been like a little girl. When she wasn\u2019t cultivating, she served at his side, her demeanor gentle and humble.\u201cJunior Apprentice Sister, you\u2019ve already stood vigil over Master\u2019s coffin for seven days. If we don\u2019t leave now, we won\u2019t be able to hold out much longer!\u201dSuddenly, a stalwart figure entered the hall of mourning. His white warrior robes were tattered and stained with blood. He\u2019d just emerged from fierce, brutal combat, and every inch of him emanated terrifying power.Pi Mo!The head of Su Yi\u2019s nine closed-door disciples. His title was \u201cWar Emperor Pi Mo\u201d, and he\u2019d cultivated alongside Su Yi for thirty-nine thousand years.Qing Tang, who\u2019d been kneeling before the coffin this entire time, gradually rose.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother,\u201d she said, her tone cold and aloof, \u201cBefore he passed, Master told us, his nine inheritors, to set out on our own. So tell me\u2026. Why have you returned?\u201dPi Mo\u2019s brow furrowed slightly, and he said with an air of awe-inspiring righteousness, \u201cHow could I just stand back and watch our enemies and those traitors destroy everything Master left behind? Besides, Junior Apprentice Sister, you\u2019ve yet to leave. You\u2019re still here standing vigil. As your Senior Brother, how could I possibly leave you?\u201dQing Tang turned around. Her beautiful eyes were as cold and sharp as a knife as she stared Pi Mo down. \u201cThings have already progressed this far, but you still aren\u2019t willing to tell the truth?\u201dPi Mo\u2019s pupils constricted. \u201cJunior Apprentice Sister, what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cWhat do I mean?\u201d A mocking smile tugged at Qing Tang\u2019s lips. \u201cOthers might not know, but to me, it\u2019s clear as day: you\u2019ve always been fixated on Master\u2019s \u2018Sword of the Nine Hells.\u2019\u201dPi Mo\u2019s expression shifted slightly. After a brief silence, he grinned, his expression cold and dark. \u201cJunior Apprentice Sister, are you telling me you\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0standing vigil over Master\u2019s coffin for the sake of that blade?\u201dQing Tang didn\u2019t deny it. Her fair, untainted features and peerlessly beautiful face were as tranquil as ever. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m not just staying here on account of the Sword of the Nine Hells.\u201d\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d Pi Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask.Qing Tang glanced outside the hall of mourning and watched the devils\u2019 and divinities\u2019 brutal slaughter. When she spoke, it was without the slightest ripple of surprise. \u201cWhat Master left behind\u2026\u201cI want it all!\u201dEvery word was calm and casual, but as she made this final declaration, Qing Tang\u2019s slender, beautiful figure gained an imposing, majestic air.\u201cYou want it all\u2026\u2026?\u201d Pi Mo froze at first, but soon, he couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. He jeered, \u201cI never would have guessed that of Master\u2019s nine inheritors, the one with the biggest appetite would be you, the youngest! Junior Apprentice Sister, if Master were alive to see this, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019d be shocked too. He never would have guessed his most beloved, trusted Qing Tang was actually so greedy!\u201dIn truth, Su Yi had been a detached observer this entire time.He didn\u2019t care about the Golden-Winged Great Peng or the Levitating Sword Hall\u2019s betrayal.He didn\u2019t care even when his greatest enemies fought their way to his door.But when he learned that his most highly-regarded inheritor, Pi Mo, and most treasured, beloved Qing Tang were each conspiring and scheming against him\u2026He was silent.It was just a bit of treasure, yet it was enough to turn the two apprentices against each other. Alas!Clang!Suddenly, Qing Tang attacked. With a single swing of her sword, she left Pi Mo gravely wounded.His injuries left him a hair\u2019s breadth from dying. He seized his last chance at survival and fled the hall of mourning, but as he did, he cried out in a mix of shock, fury, and panic. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought?! You witch, you sure hid your true self awfully deep!\u201dHe never would have guessed that his junior apprentice sister\u2019s cultivation was far more terrifying than he\u2019d imagined.Su Yi was surprised too.\u00a0So, that girl actually broke through a long time ago.Pi Mo didn\u2019t linger. He fled as quickly as he could.Qing Tang didn\u2019t pursue him. She stood alone before the bronze coffin, a hint of a sneer at her lips, muttering, \u201cHow much would Master\u2019s heart ache if he knew that his eldest disciple was the first to collude with the Six Great Daoist Sects?\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s Third Apprentice Brother, Huo Yao. Although he never got mixed up in this, when he left, he stole the Abstruse Primordial God Mirror. This treasure alone is enough to boost him to the \u2018Imperial Realm\u2019......\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, Master has already passed on. He will never know any of this.\u201d Qing Tang sighed lightly.But Su Yi\u2019s expression gradually darkened.Only now did he learn that his most trusted eldest disciple had initiated this betrayal, effectively inviting wolves into his home!Only now did he learn that his third disciple, Huo Yao, had pilfered the treasure that controlled this entire hidden realm, the Abstruse Primordial God Mirror!No wonder those traitors and his enemies had slaughtered their way into his territory with such ease\u2026.When this thought occurred to him, Su Yi was both furious and melancholy.It was then that Qing Tang suddenly walked out of the hall of mourning.Her silhouette was slender and graceful, and she seemed detached from worldly affairs. A pair of beautiful yet cold eyes swept across heaven and earth. Her icy voice rang out, \u201cFrom this day forth, I, Qing Tang, shall reign supreme over the Wilds!\u201dWhoosh!A vast whirlwind of sword intent swept forth, covering heaven and earth. The misty green sword intent swept out like a divine executioner\u2019s blade, easily slaughtering one terrifying figure after another.In but an instant\u2014Heaven and earth were like a canvas painted entirely in divine blood!The remaining terrifying existences were, without exception, astonished. They felt a chill course through them, as if they\u2019d plunged into an icy abyss.\u201cSubmit, or die.\u201dHer tone was indifferent, but in this bloodsoaked land, her every word spread far and wide.\u201cWe\u2019re willing to serve!\u201d\u201cEmpress, we hereby proclaim you our sovereign!\u201dBeneath Qing Tang\u2019s intimidating grandeur, the surviving experts and divinities all lowered their heads!\u201cThat girl\u2026.\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. He couldn\u2019t stay calm; he never would have guessed that Qing Tang\u2019s cultivation had already reached such a level.As her master, he ought to have been gratified.But now, all he felt was an unspeakable loneliness and desolation.At a time like this, there was no way he\u2019d misunderstand what was happening. His youngest and most beloved disciple had been keeping secrets from him all these years!Shortly after, Qing Tang turned and walked back into the hall of mourning.Her gaze returned to the bronze coffin. She bowed and offered her respects, then said calmly, \u201cVenerable Master, your disciple, Qing Tang, has kept vigil beside your coffin for seven days, and I helped you suppress your enemies and those traitors. In doing so, I have completed our bond as master and disciple.\u201d\u201cFrom this day forth, I shall be the sole inheritor of all you have left behind.\u201d As she spoke, she strode forward. Her hands pressed against the bronze coffin, and she whispered, \u201cThe Sword of the Nine Hells cannot simply accompany you to the grave. Once I\u2019ve grasped its mysteries, I shall naturally return it to you. Venerable Master, don\u2019t blame me for disrupting your rest\u2026.\u201dBang!The coffin\u2019s lid opened.However, the moment it did, Qing Tang lost her ever-present calm composure. Her expression changed in a rare display of emotion.\u201cHow is this\u2026.?\u201dThe bronze coffin was completely empty.Never mind the Sword of the Nine Hells; even her master\u2019s remains were missing!Su Yi watched this entire scene play out, and his fury seemed to set his pupils ablaze.Yes, he\u2019d prepared for this possibility from the moment he decided to reincarnate and cultivate anew.His inner fury was nevertheless difficult to repress.But gradually, the fiery rage in Su Yi\u2019s eyes abated. In the end, nothing remained but endless indifference and icy cold.\u201cI hope you wretches are still alive and well when I return\u2026.\u201dThen, Su Yi\u2019s imperceptible, ethereal figure disappeared into the void, vanishing completely.\u2026\u2026In the 108,000th calendar year of the Wild\u2019s history, the supreme ruler of the Wilds\u2019 Nine Provinces, the Swordmaster of Abstruse Force, Su Xuanjun, passed away. His death shook the entire Wilds.Seven days later.The disciple of the Swordmaster of Abstruse Force, Empress Qing Tang, swept across all four directions, heaven, and earth. She suppressed all the deities of the divine continent, and declared herself supreme ruler of the world.\u2026\u2026Five hundred years later.The Great Zhou Empire, Cloudriver Prefecture, Guangling City.It was evening, and the sunset was like fire.Outside of Pinecloud Sword Manor.Su Yi stood alone, far away from everyone else, waiting for his little sister-in-law, Wen Lingxue, to get out of class.Seth's ThoughtsHi! I\u2019m Seth, the translator of this novel. This is my second project, but my first project on Wuxiaworld\u2019s main site. I\u2019m really excited to be here, and if you\u2019ve read this far, thank you!Here are just a few notes for this first chapter. Minor spoilers for this first chapter, so please read the chapter first if you haven\u2019t already. No spoilers for anything beyond that, I promise.First, Su Yi and Su Xuanjun are the same person. You\u2019ve likely picked up on that already, especially if you\u2019ve read lots of Chinese fiction and are familiar with the concept of courtesy names. For those unfamiliar with the concept, a courtesy name is bestowed upon a man upon reaching adulthood, and it\u2019s used as a show of respect. Using his given name is either affectionate or rude, depending on context. At this point in the text, it is uncertain whether the post-hundred-year-timeskip Su Yi has a courtesy name or not.It\u2019s also worth noting that \u201cXuanjun\u201d, Su Yi\u2019s courtesy name, is written with the same characters as \u201cAbstruse Force.\u201d I chose to leave the name in pinyin, but since the second is more of a title, I translated it. Going forward, I will translate the character as \u201cabstruse\u201d in reference to Su Yi and his abilities, but use the more common synonyms \u201cprofound\u201d or \u201cmysterious\u201d in other contexts.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Live-in Son-in-Law, Su Yi\u201cLook, you guys! That\u2019s Su Yi!\u201d\u201cA year ago, he was the \u2018Sword Chief' of the Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, a rising celebrity. But then, due to some unexpected misfortune, he lost his entire cultivation and became the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law. What a pity!\u201d\u201cWhat a pity about Wen Lingzhao! With that peerless elegance, she\u2019s Guangling City\u2019s uncontested number-one beauty! Yet she had to marry a waste like him. Argh!\u201d\u2026.Class had just ended.When those exiting Pinecloud Sword Manor saw Su Yi off in the distance, their expressions changed, regardless of whether they were male or female. The sound of conversation soon filled the air.A hint of resignation flashed across Su Yi\u2019s face, but at the same time, he found it a bit funny.It had been a long time since he\u2019d \u201cenjoyed\u201d such treatment.He recalled his past life. Starting from antiquity and continuing to the modern day, countless distinguished figures strove and competed for power.The Six Great Daoist Sects towered proudly, looking down on the mortal world.The Three Great Demonic Sects brought about war and turmoil.Buddhas and gods commanded the wind and clouds, raising the curtain on a new world and dyeing the landscape red with blood.Yet one man reigned supreme as the sole sovereign of the Wilds, and his sword kept the Nine Provinces at bay for one hundred and eight thousand years. Only he, Su Xuanjun, had accomplished such a feat!Those known as \u201cimperial experts\u201d stood at the pinnacle of destiny, but no matter how lofty and proud they were, even they had to avert their\u00a0gazes\u00a0and call him \u201cvenerate.\u201dSu Yi inwardly shook his head.\u00a0If those old fogies from my past life saw this, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019d laugh so hard, their bellies would burst\u2026The current him was tall and thin with handsome features. He wore blue cloth robes, and stood with his hands behind his back, emanating an air of aloof, leisurely indifference.But they\u2019re not entirely wrong, either. It\u2019s true; right now, I am indeed rather pathetic\u2026\u00a0Su Yi retracted his gaze and sunk into silent contemplation.His current body hailed from the Great Zhou\u2019s Yujing City, \u201cthe Jade Capital\u201d. He was a member of the Su Family, but he was just the snubbed son of a concubine.When he was five, his mother, Ye Yufei, left this mortal coil.At fourteen, he entered Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s \u201cBlueriver Sword Manor\u201d to cultivate.In just two short years, he rose to prominence in a single bound, becoming the number one disciple of the outer court, the \u201cOuter Sect\u2019s Sword Chief.\u201dBut then, a sudden incident robbed him of his entire cultivation.Shortly after, under the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Clan\u2019s forceful arrangements, he became the live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family, one of Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans.But then, the past is the past, and the present is the present. It\u2019d be obvious to anyone that I\u2019m no longer my former self\u2026.\u00a0A peculiar emotion surged through Su Yi\u2019s heart, and an obscure, indescribable light coursed through the depths of his eyes.Clang!As if sensing Su Yi\u2019s mood, the cold, clear hum of a sword resounded within his mind, then immediately fell silent.It was a mysterious immortal sword, its title, \u201cNine Hells\u201d!It had nine layers of \u201cDivine Chains\u201d shackling it.A year ago, the night before Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s \u201cTrial of the Sword\u201d, just as Su Yi\u2019s cultivation broke into the \u201cQi Accumulation\u201d realm, the illusory figure of the Sword of the Nine Hells silently surfaced within his sea of consciousness.The price he paid for this was his entire lifetime of cultivation.This was the true reason behind his sudden fall from grace.In the year following his marriage into the Wen Family, Su Yi spent day and night sensing the Sword of the Nine Hells within his sea of consciousness in an attempt to unlock its secrets.Just three days ago, during another attempt to connect with the Sword of the Nine Hells, he surprisingly managed to release its first seal.In doing so, he simultaneously reawakened the memories of his past incarnation as \u201cSu Xuanjun.\u201dHe thought to himself,\u00a0It\u2019s as if I dreamed those seventeen years, and only now do I realize who I truly am. There are stories of men waking after dreams of grandeur; they must have felt much the same way!His current self was only seventeen years old, in the prime of his youth, with all the will and spirit of a young man. He perfectly resembled the sun at the beginning of its ascent, full of hope.Despite my current embarrassing predicament, with the methods and experience of my past life, changing all this will be no problem at all.Su Yi stood with his hands behind his back, and as his gaze shifted, he occasionally gave off a feeling that didn\u2019t quite match his age, as if he\u2019d experienced all the profundities and vicissitudes of life already. It was the kind of calm indifference left behind after experiencing all the ups and downs of worldly affairs.There\u2019s no rush. I reincarnated because I wanted to break through the barriers I encountered in my past life\u2019s cultivation and prove the supremacy of my sword.Today, all is well in the world, and I am still young. Sooner or later, I\u2019ll naturally return to the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, find those devil spawn, and settle the debts of my past life!Scene after scene of his past life silently floated up into Su Yi\u2019s mind.There was War Emperor Pi Mo, Empress Qing Tang, the Golden-Winged Great Peng, the Levitating Sword Hall, the Six Great Daoist Sects\u2026.Hm?\u00a0Su Yi suddenly seemed to sense something. He glanced over at the Pinecloud Sword Manor\u2019s main gate.Classes had only just ended, so young men and women streamed through the gates. The atmosphere was bustling, and the students emanated the characteristic air of youth.But it was then that the vibrant atmosphere sunk into utter silence.The crowd gathered by the gates of the Pinecloud Sword Manor parted, clearing a path.Beneath countless gazes, a young woman stepped through the gate.She looked around fourteen or fifteen. Her lustrous black hair flowed behind her, and her movingly beautiful eyes shone with intelligence. Her skin was as snowy-white as cream. She was a full-on beauty-in-the-making.Her flowy blue dress was\u00a0seemly and\u00a0appropriate. Beneath the sunset, her delicate and well-proportioned figure glowed with hazy luster.It was as if she were an immortal descending to earth!Many of the nearby youths were transfixed.Most of them were around fifteen years old, just the right age to be fascinated with the opposite sex, yet too young to have learned to conceal the longing and fire in their gazes.Some of the more easily embarrassed young men lowered their heads.The girls\u2019 expressions were different. Some were jealous or envious, while others were dejected. There was no shortage of beauties among them, but compared to the girl in the blue dress, they were obviously lacking.They were like fireflies before the light of the moon; they simply couldn\u2019t compete.Amidst the quiet, the girl in the blue dress\u2019s gait was neither leisurely nor hurried. Her complexion was fair, and her features were exquisitely crafted. Her big eyes were clear, and her gaze was penetrating.However, her expression was frigid, like an aloof iceberg standing apart from the rest of the world, so cold that others dared not approach her.Wen Lingxue.It had only been a year since she entered the Pinecloud Sword Manor, but every last instructor already saw her as a stunning genius. She was well-known as an icy beauty.Xie Jiuwei, the head of the Pinecloud Sword Manor, had once sighed that she was bright and pretty, as pure as the ice and snow. She was like the pearl of the Pinecloud Sword Manor.But in Su Yi\u2019s eyes, this girl who attracted attention wherever she went was Wen Lingzhao\u2019s little sister.As well as his\u2026 little sister-in-law.\u201cShe\u2019s getting prettier and prettier.\u201d A hint of a smile flashed across Su Yi\u2019s face.In the year since his marriage into the Wen Family, practically everyone had disdained and made fun of him, ridiculing him in countless different ways.Only Wen Lingxue really treated him as her brother-in-law, and she even regularly argued on his behalf.\u201cBrother-in-law, what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d When she saw Su Yi in the distance, Wen Lingxue\u2019s gemstone-like eyes lit up with delight and incomparable surprise.In an instant, her powdery lips curved into a smile straight from the heart.It was a smile like a sudden sunbeam. Her \u201ciceberg\u201d demeanor melted in an instant.Quite a few male students were visibly dazed, and their hearts pounded in their chests.\u201cSo pretty\u2026.\u201d Some people couldn\u2019t help but mutter.\u201cShe\u2026. She actually smiled\u2026.\u201d Others were entranced.Someone sighed, \u201cYou might not believe me when I say this, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen Pinecloud Sword Manor\u2019s number-one beauty smile all year!\u201dMany others chimed in their agreement. Wen Lingxue\u2019s name contained the character for \u201csnow\u201d, and they thought it suited her. Despite her beautiful appearance, her temperament was icy and aloof.Despite studying under the same roof, practically none of them had seen her smile before!One of the girl\u2019s expressions was complicated. \u201cUgh. If I were as good looking as her, I wouldn\u2019t have spent a year chasing Senior Apprentice Brother Xiao to no avail.\u201dEven the girls had no choice but to admit that both in terms of appearance and temperament, Wen Lingxue put inexorable pressure on her female classmates.Within Pinecloud Sword Manor, none of the girls were willing to spend time with Wen Lingxue unless it was absolutely necessary. They\u2019d only serve as a foil to further highlight\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue\u2019s shocking beauty.Facing these varying gazes, Wen Lingxue changed her prior unhurried gait and dashed right up to Su Yi!The young men\u2019s pupils constricted. They seemed to have a sudden realization. \u201cDid she\u2026 Did Wen Lingxue just smile at that useless waste?\u201dIt seemed they didn\u2019t dare believe it. They looked at each other.As far as they knew, although Su Yi was Wen Lingxue\u2019s brother-in-law, he was still just a live-in son-in-law!With that low, awkward status, it wasn\u2019t just the major characters of the Wen Family that looked down on him; even the servants dared make fun of him.This was common knowledge in Guangling City, too.Yet Wen Lingxue\u2019s attitude towards Su Yi was incomparably affectionate, and she even let slip an uncharacteristic display of delight when she saw him.Anyone with functional eyes could see that Wen Lingxue was happy!Strange!Something was strange about this!At first, the young men dared not believe their eyes.When he saw her bright, beautiful smile, Su Yi smiled back. \u201cSo, is this how you act when you\u2019re in school?\u201dThis was the first time he\u2019d come to meet Wen Lingxue after class.It was also his first time seeing that icy, aloof demeanor of hers.It was nothing like his impression of her. In the year following his marriage into the Wen Family, she\u2019d been vibrant and bright, cute and playful. There was nothing remotely \u201cicy\u201d about her.\u201cIf I don\u2019t act cold here, who knows how many irritating guys will follow me around and pester me. It\u2019s way too irritating!\u201d Wen Lingxue pressed her lips into a smile. Her voice was crisp and sweet, like the bubbling of spring water.Su Yi instantly understood.It was true. Even by the standards of his previous life, Wen Lingxue was a first-class little beauty. Once she grew up a bit more, she was sure to be even more stunning.With that level of good looks, she was destined to have no short of admirers.Wen Lingxue\u2019s gaze swept around her dazed classmates. She suddenly felt a little guilty, and she pursed her lips in vexation, muttering, \u201cIt\u2019s all over! A moment\u2019s joy and I ruined the cold image I spent a whole year building up! It\u2019s all gone to waste\u2026.\u201dBut then, she chortled and waved valiantly. \u201cForget it. Who cares what they think? It\u2019s fine so long as I\u2019m happy.\u201dShe affectionately linked arms with Su Yi, her face nothing but smiles. \u201cLet\u2019s go home, Brother-in-law.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Su Yi smiled back and nodded. Then, the two of them left together.The gathered students watched their departure. The area around Pinecloud Sword Manor fell silent.\u201cWho can explain why on earth Lingxue is so affectionate to that waste?\u201d spat a handsome youth through gnashed teeth.Everyone looked at each other. They didn\u2019t understand either.\u201cHe\u2019s a live-in son-in-law, the laughingstock of Guangling City, and a waste who lost his entire cultivation. It\u2019s bad enough that he married a beauty like Wen Lingzhao, but now he\u2019s extending his poisonous reach towards her little sister? How detestable!\u201dMany of the youths were indignant, and their hearts were full of bitter envy.Even the girls struggled to understand it. They too thought it strange.Wen Lingxue was so proud, cold, and beautiful. She wasn\u2019t just shockingly beautiful, either. Even her cultivation was at the peak of the manor\u2019s current generation of disciples.She\u2026\u2026How could she take a liking to someone like Su Yi?Even if he was her brother-in-law, rumor had it that her sister, Wen Lingzhao, hated nothing more than her worthless husband!Meanwhile, on their way home, Wen Lingxue batted her bright eyes and asked curiously, \u201cBrother-in-law, you\u2019ve never liked leaving the house. Why did you\u00a0come\u00a0meet me at the gate today of all days?\u201dThe young woman was bright and pure. Her delicate, graceful figure was vibrant and full of youthfulness.\u201cYour big sister\u2019s come back,\u201d said Su Yi. He spoke casually, but hints of inexplicable emotion rose within his heart.Wen Lingxue\u2019s beautiful eyes lit up with delight. \u201cBig Sister, she\u2026. She\u2019s finally willing to come home?\u201dA year ago, on Wen Lingzhao and Su Yi\u2019s wedding night, Wen Lingzhao had disappeared without warning and headed to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital to cultivate at Blueriver Sword Manor.Everyone thought that this was Wen Lingzhao\u2019s way of expressing her displeasure and resentment over her marriage.Even Wen Lingxue knew that her big sister loathed and rejected this marriage arrangement and that she\u2019d never accepted Su Yi as her husband.Yet now, one year later, Wen Lingzhao\u00a0had\u00a0returned!Seth's ThoughtsSeth again! Feel free to skip this, as it\u2019s not needed to understand the story, but here\u2019s a quick cultural note for those curious\u2026The concept of a live-in son-in-law doesn\u2019t really exist in the west. If you\u2019re curious to know more, or if you\u2019re struggling to understand why the supporting cast are so disdainful about it, here\u2019s a brief overview:I can\u2019t speak to modern Chinese marriages, but in ancient China, daughters traditionally married into the husband\u2019s family, essentially leaving their family of origin behind to join his. This often meant living in his ancestral home and taking care of her new in-laws, especially if her husband was an eldest son.Husbands marrying into their wives families instead was not unheard of, but it was an inversion of gender roles, with all the stigma that often entails. Furthermore, since taking on a live-in son-in-law was most common of wealthy families with daughters but no sons, the perception was that such husbands were burdens or moochers, living off a woman instead of supporting their family the way a man should. Any children born under such an arrangement would take on their mother\u2019s surname.In colloquial Chinese, the character used to describe such men, \u201c\u8d58\u201d has taken on the additional meaning of \u201cburden\u201d or pointless.\u201d That\u2019s arguably the more common use of the character now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - My Wife, Wen LingzhaoAfter her excitement passed, Wen Lingxue suddenly seemed to realize something, and her bright eyes looked Su Yi up and down once more. \u201cBrother-in-law, you haven\u2019t\u00a0set a foot\u00a0outside since you married into the Wen Family. Moreover, you\u2019ve been dejected, world-weary, and down in the dumps. I\u2019ve been worried about you; I was really scared you\u2019d take things to heart and do something bad.\u201dShe examined Su Yi intently, then said in confusion, \u201cBut now, even though only a month has passed since we last saw each other, you seem like a completely different person.\u201dSu Yi was inwardly stunned.\u00a0Her intuition\u2019s quite sharp!Disciples of Pinecloud Sword Manor got two days off a month, and it had been a month since Su Yi last saw Wen Lingxue.He wouldn\u2019t have guessed that she\u2019d pick up on his change so quickly.\u201cI thought some things through recently,\u201d said Su Yi with a laugh. \u201cI won\u2019t act like I did earlier anymore.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s it!\u201d Wen Lingxue lit up, and a radiant smile spread across her beautiful face. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! I prefer you like this, Brother-in-law. You have a certain\u2026. Hmm, it\u2019s hard to describe, but it\u2019s like they say in books: \u2018the air of a treasure in the making, a youth with glorious prospects, whose smile is as radiant as if he were carrying the moon, as aloof and transcendent as a solitary tree!\u2019\u201dShe walked with her hands behind her back. Her dress was like jade, her smile like a flower. Her joy came straight from the heart, and she seemed like an entirely different person than Pinecloud Sword Manor\u2019s Ice Queen.If those classmates of hers saw her now, they\u2019d be too stunned to function. The emotional damage would devastate them.Su Yi laughed out loud.When someone changed, it often happened overnight.Especially in his case. With the knowledge and breadth of experience of his past life, his temperament wasn\u2019t even remotely comparable to what it had been before!The Wen Family.They were one of the Three Great Clans of Guangling City. Their estate was located in the northwest district, and it occupied a full hundred acres. Courtyards were scattered throughout, and the mansions were as numerous as trees in the forest.Night was falling.As soon as Su Yi and Wen Lingxue returned home, they saw someone waiting for them by the door, and she was obviously frantic.She was Qin Qing, Su Yi\u2019s mother-in-law. Despite her age, she looked bright and dignified, and she had a distinctive, mature charm. She\u2019d undoubtedly been a peerless beauty in her youth.\u201cYou worthless waste of food! All I asked was that you bring Wenxue back from school. What took you so long?\u201d Qin Qing shot Su\u00a0Yi a vicious\u00a0glare. She looked completely fed up.Just looking at him made her temper flare up. Who knew how much mocking laughter and idle chatter she\u2019d heard lately on account of this son-in-law of hers?Su Yi\u2019s expression was calm. He wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned.It had been a year since his marriage into the Wen Family. He was well aware of how fiery and unreasonable his mother-in-law\u2019s temper was.But then, he also knew that Qin Qing had opposed his marriage to Wen Lingzhao right from the start, and she\u2019d been vocal about expressing her rejection and dissatisfaction.But when the family matriarch personally decreed that the marriage was to proceed, Qin Qing dared not disobey. She could only hold her nose and endure.Wen Lingxue stuck out her neck for Su Yi. \u201cMom, it was me. After getting out of class, I dilly-dallied a bit\u2026.\u201d\u201cFine. Off to dinner with you, girl.\u201d Qin Qing waved her away irritably, then turned her cold gaze on Su Yi. \u201cCome with me. Everyone\u2019s waiting for you in the clan hall, you know!\u201dWhen she heard that, Wen Lingxue couldn't help but ask, \u201cThe clan hall? They\u2019re waiting for Brother-in-law? What for?\u201d\u201cHow is that any of your concern? You sit tight and stay in the family estate. Don\u2019t go anywhere! You hear me?\u201dQin Qing\u2019s words were harsh. Wen Lingxue simply said \u201cOh\u201d and shot Su Yi a surreptitious glance. Her clear, bright eyes carried a hint of concern.Su Yi laughed. \u201cDo as you\u2019re told. Off to dinner with you!\u201dOnly then did Wen Lingxue turn and enter the courtyard.Qin Qing witnessed this entire reaction, and she was instantly on guard. She glowered at Su Yi. \u201cLingxue is still young. If you dare have any deviant thoughts about her, I\u2019ll cripple you even if it kills me!\u201dThe corners of Su Yi\u2019s lips twitched.\u00a0Am I, Su Xuanjun, really that type of person?\u201cCome with me.\u201d Qin Qing didn\u2019t waste anymore words, nor did she spare Su Yi a second glance. She was afraid that if she did, she\u2019d lose her temper and curse him out again.The clan hall.Resplendent lanterns illuminated the entire lavishly decorated space. The Head of the Wen Family, Wen Changjing, was present, as were the rest of the family higher-ups. They sat on both sides of the hall in order of rank, chatting amongst themselves. The atmosphere was both relaxed and lively.However, the instant Su Yi followed Qin Qing inside, all conversation died off as everyone turned to look at him.Their expressions all went a bit strange. There was cruel laughter, disdain, pity, and mockery.The lively, relaxed atmosphere sank considerably, too.Although these gazes were targeted at Su Yi, they made Qin Qing thoroughly uncomfortable. She muttered coldly, \u201cYou wait here.\u201dThen, she dashed off to sit beside her husband, Wen Changtai.Su Yi still acted like this had nothing to do with him. He just stood in the center of the hall, and his gaze swept across the gathering of Wen Family higher-ups.Hm?\u00a0Su Yi paused. He\u2019d just noticed a familiar, graceful figure.Her eyebrows were thin and faint, her teeth were pearly white, and her eyes shone. She wore a pale blue dress, and sat with her long, slender legs together. She was entirely unadorned, with all the natural beauty of a hibiscus rising from clear waters\u2014an innate, unsurpassed charm.Hers was a transcendent beauty. She was the real thing.However, her gaze was icy, proud, and aloof, as if she were thousands of miles away.Wen Lingzhao!She was, at least nominally, Su Yi\u2019s wife!In Guangling City, she was a peerless beauty, second to none, with the good looks of a fairy. Her talent for martial arts was equally shocking and outstanding. Who knew how many talented youths admired her?Ah, so that\u2019s where that cold attitude Wenxue has at school came from. She\u2019s obviously imitating her big sister.\u00a0Su Yi instantly understood.Wen Lingxue pretended to be cold, but Wen Lingzhao really was cold. Her icy, aloof demeanor had already fused into her very bones.Meanwhile, Wen Lingzhao noticed Su Yi\u2019s gaze and faintly scrunched up her brow. A moment later, she regained her usual calm, and her cold eyes didn\u2019t so much as glance in Su Yi\u2019s direction. She outright ignored him.Husband and wife had been apart an entire year, yet they were acting like strangers!\u201cSu Yi, I called you here to inform you of something.\u201d Sitting in the clan hall\u2019s seat of honor, Family Head Wen Changjing\u2019s tone was casual, but he instantly drew everyone\u2019s attention.Wen Changjing was clad in purple. He was bearded, and his hair was white. He had a face like carved jade. His hands were on his armrests, and he towered like a dignified mountain.\u201cDue to Lingzhao\u2019s stunning talent, despite having only cultivated within the Blueriver Sword Manor for a year, she had the good fortune to attract a major power\u2019s attention. They\u2019ve given her a recommendation to continue her cultivation at Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy.\u201cIn other words, Lingzhao is already an official student of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy.\u201d Wen Changjing glanced indifferently at Su Yi. \u201cYou were once the \u2018Sword Chief\u2019 of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect. You might be worthless now, but you should still understand what kind of vast and transcendent existence Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy is. To the Wen Family, Lingzhao\u2019s admission is a blessing as grand as the heavens themselves.\u201dSo that\u2019s what was going on.\u00a0Only now did Su Yi understand why the Wen Family\u2019s higher-ups had called him here.Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy was the top cultivation spot in all of Gunzhou, the \u201cGun\u201d or \u201cImperatorial Province.\u201d Practically everyone capable of gaining admission was a peak-level genius in their state of origin!It had only been a year since Wen Lingzhao began her cultivation at Blueriver Sword Manor, but she\u2019d already earned a recommendation to continue her studies at Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. It was immediately obvious just how shocking her talent for the Martial Dao was.To the Wen Family, this was indeed a blessing.But to Su Yi, this meant that it would be a long, long time before he next saw his wife.When he realized this, he glanced at the nearby Wen Lingzhao, but she was as cold and expressionless as ever.\u201cFamily Head, Elders, have you called me here to ask my opinion?\u201d asked Su Yi.When the group heard this, they were stunned. Their expressions soon turned strange.A burst of jeering followed. \u201cSu Yi, you\u2019re overthinking this! This isn\u2019t up for discussion. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you agree or not. We won\u2019t let a wretch like you hold back Lingzhao\u2019s glorious future!\u201dThe speaker was Wen Changqing, Wen Lingzhao\u2019s second uncle. He was whiskerless, and he wore brocade robes. His gaze was sharp and sinister.The hall burst into soft laughter. It seemed Su Yi\u2019s words had amused them.A mere live-in son-in law wanted to share his opinion on this particular matter?Surely he realized that in the eyes of the Wen Family, he was nothing but an insignificant waste?Yet against all expectations\u2014Su Yi responded with utter calm and complete ease, as if none of this had anything to do with him.His relaxed composure actually made several of those about to taunt him rather uncomfortable.\u201cIf you\u2019ve already made your decision, might I ask why you\u2019ve called me here?\u201d Su Yi asked casually.Before reawakening his memories, their taunts and insults would have been hard to bear. He\u2019d surely have been indignant.But Su Yi was no longer that person. Why should he care about such things?\u201cIt\u2019s because I wanted to take this opportunity to see you, Senior Apprentice Brother Su.\u201d A burst of crisp, hearty laughter echoed throughout the hall, and a handsome, dignified-looking youth in wide-sleeved white robes strode inside.Instantly, the gathered members of the Wen Family rose from their chairs, warm smiles plastered on their faces.\u201cYoung Master Wei, please take a seat!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wei, we planned to send Su Yi to greet you. We\u2019re flattered that you\u2019d pay us a visit in person. Please forgive us for failing to greet you properly.\u201d\u2026..Their flattering words contained blatant fawning and adulation, each more zealous than the next.Family Head\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changjing even went so far as to guide \u201cYoung Master\u00a0Wei\u201d into\u00a0the hall personally.Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but inwardly shake his head. Their behavior was really sickening\u2026.But then, the white-robed youth strode right up to Su Yi, his manner overbearing and arrogant. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, long time no see.\u201dSeth's ThoughtsThe first part of Wen Lingxue\u2019s elaborate, flowery compliment, \u201cthe air of a treasure in the making, a youth with glorious prospects, whose smile is as radiant as if he were carrying the moon\u201d comes from the poem \u201cMaster White Stone\u201d by Song Dynasty poet Guo Maoqian. I did not find any official or professional translations of it, so I did my best to come up with something appealing and comprehensible while staying as true to the classical Chinese as I could manage.The second part, as far as I can tell, is not a reference to anything in particular. It has a distinctly literary feel, though, so I tried to evoke that with my translation.__I don\u2019t think you can even call this a spoiler so much as a terminology adjustment.Early in the story, the author calls the province Cloudriver Prefecture is located in \u201c\u201cHeaven\u2019s Origin Province\u201d, but he later switches to \u886e\u5dde, or \u201cGunzhou.\u201d I decided to just go ahead and make the switch now.As for the name, \u886e means \u201cimperial robes\u201d, or \u201cinexorable advance\u201d when reduplicated, but it\u2019s usually used alongside other characters, and it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious to me how to translate it. I considered just leaving it as pinyin, but \"the Gun Province\" is a bit misleading, so here we are. If for whatever reason I decide to adjust my approach, I'll let you know.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - One Hand to Overturn Wind and RainWei Zhengyang.He was an outer-sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor, as well as a direct descendent of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2019s peak-level clan, the Wei Family.This status alone was enough to instill terror and awe in the Wen Family.\u201cAh, so you\u2019re the one who wanted to see me, Junior Apprentice Brother Wei.\u201d Su Yi nodded slightly.During the three years he'd spent cultivating in the Blueriver Sword Manor, Wei Zhengyang had always seen him as his competition.\u00a0However, no matter how hard Wei Zhengyang had worked, Su Yi had always managed to stay one step ahead of him.In other words, for three years, Wei Zhengyang had lived in his shadow!Now, Wei Zhengyang\u2019s unbridled gaze evaluated Su Yi. He suddenly let out a long, lamentful sigh. \u201cWho would have thought that the glorious Sword Chief of the Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect would fall back into the dust in the blink of an eye? Worse, you didn\u2019t just lose your entire cultivation; you even became a live-in son-in-law. Alas! How regrettable!\"His voice transmitted throughout the great hall, echoing repeatedly. Everyone\u2019s expressions shifted, but Su Yi just smiled faintly and said, \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve forgotten the lessons I taught you. Do you need me to refresh your memory?\u201dIn just one sentence, he hit Wei Zhengyang right where it hurt. Wei Zhengyang recalled several unpleasant incidents, and his expression gradually soured.\u201cSu Yi, you are not to be rude to Young Master Wei!\u201d Family Head Wen Changjing shot to his feet and roared. His cold, penetrating gaze carried a clear threat.Although Su Yi had long since known that the Wen Family looked down on him, he was still a little surprised.Wen Changjing was the esteemed head of the Wen Clan!Yet here he was, right in front of everyone, threatening his own family\u2019s son-in-law in favor of an outsider?When he looked at the other high-ranking members of the Wen Family, Su Yi saw nothing but cold disdain. No one thought Wen Changjing\u2019s\u00a0admonishment the\u00a0least bit inappropriate.There was no doubt that, the way they saw it, a live-in son-in-law like him was more furniture than person. They could treat him however they pleased.Fine. That works too.\u00a0Su Yi\u2019s expression was suddenly even more indifferent, and in his heart, he drew a clear line between himself and the Wen Family.\u201cSu Yi, I didn\u2019t come all the way here from the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital just to see you make a fool of yourself!\u201d Wei Zhengyang said coldly. He\u2019d noticed the Wen Family\u2019s attitude towards Su Yi, and it only made him even more fearless.\u201cOh? Then what did you come for?\u201d asked Su Yi.The corners of Wei Zhengyang\u2019s lips tugged upward, and his hawk-eyed gaze bore into Su Yi. He extended two of his fingers and, pausing for emphasis between each word, said, \u201cI\u2019m here for two reasons:\u201cFirst, when Lingzhao leaves for Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy tomorrow, I\u2019ll be going with her. Relax; I\u2019ll take good care of her. I guarantee I won\u2019t let her suffer the slightest injustice!\u201cSecond, I\u2019m here to remind you of your place. You\u2019re nothing but a live-in son-in-law who lost his entire cultivation. You\u2019re in no way worthy of Lingzhao!\u201cI\u2019ll return to the Wen Family another day, and when I do, I\u2019ll be sure to annul Lingzhao\u2019s marriage contract. As for you, Su Yi\u2026. you\u2019re certain to get kicked out onto the streets!\u201cWhen that day comes, if you have trouble feeding yourself, you can stay by my side as my flunky. I\u2019m not so short on cash that I can\u2019t feed a piece of refuse!\u201dHis words were crisp and his voice boomed. His eyes glowed with malice, confident disdain, and wanton pride.The great hall was utterly quiet. Even the birds fell silent.Everyone\u2019s expressions turned strange.No matter what, Su Yi and Wen Lingzhao were husband and wife.For Wei Zhengyang to say such words in front of the gathered higher-ups of the Wen Family was the biggest insult to Su Yi imaginable!Furthermore, his words left Family Head Wen Changjing and the others a bit uncomfortable too.Still, no one dared say anything.The Wei Family was a peak-level clan capable of influencing all nineteen of Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s cities!And Wei Zhengyang was the current head of the family\u2019s son. His status was so lofty, the Wen Family wouldn\u2019t even consider provoking him!Qin Qing\u2019s eyes actually lit up. She thoroughly scrutinized Wei Zhengyang, then compared him to Su Yi. She felt increasingly displeased.If her daughter had married this Young Master Wei instead\u2026. Who in the Wen Family would be so blind as to look down on her?But against all expectations\u2026.Even after enduring this level of abuse, Su Yi showed no ripples of surprise. His composure actually left the onlookers a bit confused.This guy\u2026. He really isn\u2019t angry? Not even a little?\u00a0Wei Zhengyang furrowed his brow. He was here to flaunt his status and, more than that, to use the threat of \u201cwife-stealing\u201d to humiliate Su Yi.Who would have thought his taunts weren\u2019t the least bit effective? He felt as if he\u2019d swung his fist, only to hit cotton. It was stifling!Su Yi took in the crowd\u2019s expressions, but he remained calm, like a god gazing down from the heavens at a petty dispute of some corner of the mortal world.To him, Wei Zhengyang was like a dancing flea\u2014ridiculous!At this stage, how can he possibly maintain that detached attitude\u2026.?\u00a0Although no one noticed, the icy Wen Lingzhao had been watching this entire time. A nigh imperceptible hint of confusion and surprise flickered in the depths of her gaze.It was then that Su Yi\u2019s gaze swept across the hall, and he said calmly, \u201cNo matter what, so long as our marriage contract is in place, I am still Wen Lingzhao\u2019s husband and the Wen Family\u2019s son-in-law.\u201cYet now, an outsider stands in our great hall, making grand proclamations about how he\u2019s going to \u2018take care\u2019 of my wife for me.\u201cEveryone, if word of this spreads, how will the people regard the Wen Family?\u201cAnd how will they see\u2026. Wen Lingzhao?\u201dHis words were flat, his tone leisurely, yet they went off like a sudden crack of thunder.Wen Changjing and the other higher-ups\u2019 expressions shifted dramatically, and they could no longer remain seated.They might not care about Su Yi\u2019s feelings, but they couldn\u2019t disregard the Wen Family\u2019s prestige and reputation!Qin Qing and Wen Changtai suddenly came to their senses. Their expressions were unsightly, and they were practically frantic. If word of this spread, as Wen Lingzhao\u2019s parents, they would unquestionably bear the brunt of the shame.Even Wen Lingzhao reacted; there were newfound dark clouds amidst her icy, peerless beauty, and hints of sullen anger in her bright eyes.Wei Zhengyang gulped.\u00a0This is bad!He would never have guessed that a few short words from Su Yi would change the Wen Family\u2019s attitude so dramatically. If he didn\u2019t explain himself, this misunderstanding would only get worse!But Su Yi didn\u2019t give him the chance to speak. He continued flatly, \u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Wei, if your family found out that you were out openly seizing other men\u2019s wives, what would they think of you?\u201cIf this gets out, I\u2019m afraid it will spread throughout the entire Cloudriver Prefecture. \u2018So, the lofty, esteemed heir of the head of the Wei Family likes kidnapping others\u2019 wives!\u2019When Su Yi next looked at Wei Zhengyang, his gaze carried a hint of pity. \u201cOnce this ill reputation becomes a reality, you\u2019re doomed; it\u2019ll stick with you for the rest of your life.\u201cYou might be the son of the Wei Family Head, but this scandal will inevitably have an enormous impact on your position within the family. Tell me\u2026. Can you bear the consequences?\u201dWith that, Su Yi reached out and patted Wei Zhengyang on the shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say. Take your time to think it over.\u201dThe great hall fell into a voiceless, repressed silence. Su Yi\u2019s words went off like sudden cracks of thunder, echoing through their hearts. The blood drained from their faces.Wei Zhengyang, meanwhile, blushed at first, but soon, he was deathly pale, and the veins\u00a0bulged\u00a0in his forehead. He started quivering from head to toe, and his eyes blazed with violent rage and shame.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Wei Zhengyang\u2019s blood surged to his head. He wanted nothing more than to beat Su Yi to death.Wen Lingzhao suddenly rose to her feet. Her bright eyes bore coldly into Wei Zhengyang. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Wei, are you done talking yet?\u201dHer peerlessly beautiful features were still as cold as ice and snow, but her voice contained unconcealed fury.Just as he was about to lose his temper, Wei Zhengyang felt as if someone had poured a bucket of ice water over his head. He was instantly frantic. \u201cJunior Apprentice Sister Lingzhao, don\u2019t misunderstand. I swear to the heavens that I didn\u2019t mean it that way!\u201dHe hurriedly tried to explain himself to Wen Lingzhao, \u201cI was just thinking that we could look out for each other while we cultivate in Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. After all, we first met at Blueriver Sword Manor. You could say we\u2019re\u2026. Friends. It\u2019s only natural that friends would help and support each other!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d said Wen Lingzhao, her pretty face icy cold. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some rest.\u201dWith that, she turned to leave the great hall.However, as she passed by Su Yi, a hint of barely indiscernible emotion flashed through her bright eyes.In the face of that level of humiliation, he managed to stay calm and composed. He\u2019d even laughed and turned the situation on its head.He\u2026.. It seems he\u2019s not as worthless as I imagined\u2026\u00a0As soon as the thought occurred to her, Wen Lingzhao inwardly shook her head.The two of them were ultimately strangers, destined to walk different paths.Su Yi was Su Yi.And she was herself.Although they were nominally husband and wife, it\u2019d be best if they never met again!Wei Zhengyang stood there, dazed, his expression incomparably unsightly.He was worried Wen Lingzhao would misunderstand him completely. He was inwardly frantic, like an ant on a hot wok.Su Yi just stood there with his hands behind his back, coldly indifferent as he watched this play out.He didn\u2019t care what Wen Lingzhao thought of him.But, if she got together with Wei Zhengyang while still technically his wife, she would unquestionably make a cuckold out of him.If word of that got out, it would be a black mark on his entire life.Detached and transcendent as Su Yi was, he couldn\u2019t bear for something like that to happen.That was why he\u2019d spoken up earlier: he had to turn this situation around!Wei Zhengyang, that scoundrel, clearly has ill intentions for Wen Lingzhao. Later on, I\u2019ll have to find an opportunity to get rid of him. It\u2019ll save me from unknowingly wearing a green hat\u2026.Su Yi inwardly made up his mind. He had no interest in sticking around to watch the rest of the show, so he turned and addressed the crowd. \u201cEveryone, please feel free to keep chatting. I\u2019m getting tired, so I\u2019ll head out first.\u201dAfter a breezy farewell, he turned to leave.Wei Zhengyang still had a bellyful of fire, and he snapped, \u201cSu Yi, stop right there!\u201d\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Wei, honest words hurt the ears, but I said that for your own good. I advise you to conduct yourself accordingly. Otherwise, well, \u2018loose lips lead to an early grave.\u2019\u201d Su Yi waved him away without so much as turning to look at him. His steps were leisurely, and before long, he faded into the night.Candles illuminated the great hall\u2019s interior. Every last person wore an unsightly expression on their face.Outside, the moon lit up the night sky, and the late-night breeze rustled the leaves. The tranquility was a perfect match for Su Yi\u2019s relaxed, calm mood.A petty farce like that? He could overturn it with a single hand!Seth's ThoughtsIf you\u2019re familiar with Chinese novels, odds are you\u2019re familiar with the term \u201cgreen hat.\u201d For those seeing the phrase for the first time, \u201cto wear a green hat\u201d means your wife or girlfriend is cheating on you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - The Pine and Crane Body Refining TechniqueThe night was dark as ink and silent save for the chittering of insects.Upon returning to his residence, Su Yi stood within the courtyard, held his breath, and focused until his mind was perfectly clear. Only then did he take up a stance and begin practicing his fist technique.From his perspective, the incident in the clan hall wasn\u2019t worth a second thought.Cultivation was the most important matter at hand!The path of cultivation was divided into four major stages in total: Martial Dao, Origin Dao, Spirit Dao, and Profound Dao.In his past life as The Swordmaster of Abstruse Force, Su Yi had lived for one hundred and eight thousand years, reaching the pinnacle of the Profound Dao\u2014The Profound Unity Realm!The Profound Unity Realm was also known as the Imperial Apex Realm, its\u00a0experts\u00a0emperors among emperors with lifespans of a million years. In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, they were peak-level experts that towered above the masses.Back in the day, relying on the power and influence of the Profound Unity Realm, Su Yi had numerous titles\u2014\u201cthe Head of the Wilds\u201d, \u201ca Sovereign Among Emperors\u201d, \u201cthe Swordmaster of Abstruse Force\u201d, etcetera. Each was a paramount honor; his reputation was as lofty as could be.Throughout all Nine Provinces of the Wilds, Su Yi could count those of comparable status on the fingers of a single hand!But to the current Su Yi, the Profound Unity Realm was far, far away.The task at hand was beginning his cultivation anew. He was about to step onto the Martial Dao, and he had to build an incomparably sturdy foundation for the path ahead.The Martial Dao was the first stage of cultivation, as well as the beginning of the Grand Dao.It was divided into four realms: Blood Circulation, Qi Accumulation, Inner Furnace, and An\u0101srava, or \u201cFlawlessness.\u201dThese were the \u201cFour Realms of the Martial Dao.\u201dOf them, the \u201cBlood Circulation Realm\u201d was the initial stage of the Martial Dao.In it, one circulated their blood and qi, refining the skin, muscles, sinews, and bones.Thus, it was further subdivided into four layers: Refining Skin, Refining Muscle, Refining Sinew, and Refining Bone.At the pinnacle of this realm, one\u2019s blood and qi were powerful and flourishing, with skin like bronze and bones like iron. Such experts could rip tigers and leopards apart with their bare hands and shatter boulders with a single finger.Those who stepped into this realm were called \u201cwarriors.\u201dIn the courtyard, the moonlight flowed like water, and the night sky was tranquil.Su Yi\u2019s movements were slow and deliberate, his back straight and his steps stable. His stance was firm but not rigid, flexible but not soft, and each breath carried a distinctive cadence.When he moved, he was like an immortal crane flapping its wings, light and at ease.When he was still, he was like a cliffside pine, its roots embedded firmly in the rock.The Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique.It included nine attacks and eighteen forms.It originated from \u201cThe Absolute Martial Sutra of the Eight Extremities\u201d. It was the first chapter, a method for establishing one\u2019s foundations in the Martial Dao.\u201cThe Absolute Martial Sutra of the Eight Extremities\u201d was the work of Su Yi\u2019s close friend from his past life, Gongye Chi.Gongye Chi was tyrannical by nature, a master of all martial arts. He habitually referred to himself as \u201ca mere soldier.\u201dYet to the people of the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, he was someone even experts could only look up to, \u201cthe Peerless Martial Emperor\u201d!A mighty existence, a living legend on the path of the Grand Dao!His personality was audacious and uninhibited, wantonly arrogant and aloof. He\u2019d taunted the daoists of the Six Great Daoist Sects and walloped the three Old Demons of the Three Great Demonic Sects. Who knew how many overlords of their respective territories and Imperial Realm Experts Gongye Chi had beaten black and blue, all under the pretense of \u201cpaying them a visit\u201d?But although practically no one in the world knew it, Gongye Chi wasn\u2019t undefeated!He\u2019d once \u201cvisited\u201d Su Yi, then the Swordmaster of Abstruse Force, only to lose to Su Yi\u2019s Dao of the Sword.It was because of this battle that they bonded and became close friends.Later, when Gongye Chi painstakingly compiled a lifetime of attainments into a martial arts scripture, he gave Su Yi a copy to study.That\u00a0tome\u00a0was none other than the \u201cThe Absolute Martial Sutra of the Eight\u00a0Extremities\u201d!When he first finished reading the \u201cCrane and Pine Body Refining Technique\u201d within, even Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but sigh, \u201cThis technique nears the perfection of the Dao. There\u2019s nothing to add, nor anything to take away.\u201dEven Su Yi had no choice but to admit that in terms of the early stages of cultivation, the \u201cFour Realms of the Martial Dao\u201d, Gongye Chi\u2019s attainments were clearly above his.Throughout all of the Wilds\u2019 Nine Provinces, none could compete with Gongye Chi in this regard.As such, you could call Gongye Chi\u2019s \u201cPine and Crane Body Refining Technique\u201d the number one foundational technique of the Wilds!Su Yi was about to begin his cultivation anew. He naturally didn\u2019t hesitate to choose the \u201cPine and Crane Body Refining Technique\u201d to establish the foundations of his Martial Dao.This was the only way he could surpass his past self at the same stage of cultivation!The knowledge and experience of his past life meant that Su Yi already had a clear path to follow as he cultivated anew.In this life, he had to be stronger than his former self at every stage of cultivation.Only then could he forge an unparalleled path and far surpass his past life!In the time it took to burn a stick of incense, Su Yi practiced the full Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique three times. He was already covered in a sheen of sweat, and his breathing was slightly ragged.This was already his current limit.Even so, he was in unusually high spirits, and bathed in the morning light, his tall, thin frame shone with all the youthful vigor of a seventeen-year-old.\u201cThis is already the third day since I reawakened the memories of my previous life and began my cultivation anew.\u201cBut now, after just three sets, I\u2019m already covered in sweat\u2026.\u201cThis body of mine just isn\u2019t good enough. The cultivation methods I used over the past seventeen years were full of flaws, and my foundations weren\u2019t \u2018good\u2019 at all.\u201dSu Yi wiped his brow with a cloth and pondered.In this life, before losing his cultivation, he\u2019d been the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s Outer Sect, famed throughout Cloudriver Prefecture.But in the eyes of his \u201cpast life\u201d, this minor accomplishment wasn\u2019t even worth discussing.\u201cAt seventeen years old, I\u2019ve already missed the ideal age for hammering out my Martial Dao. Fortunately, if I use the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique to establish my foundation, it won\u2019t be difficult to compensate for the flaws of my earlier cultivation.\u201cIt\u2019s just, this world\u2019s spiritual energy is a bit too sparse, isn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201dSu Yi furrowed his brows.In the three days since reawakening his memories, he\u2019d figured out just which world he was in.The Azure Continent.It was home to over a hundred nations big and small, its territory vast and expansive.He was currently in \u201cThe Great Zhou\u201d, which was but one of the Azure Continent\u2019s hundred-plus countries.In his past life, Su Yi had never once heard of the Azure Continent, but he was certain that this world was connected to the Nine Provinces of the Wilds.His reasoning was simple: the prevailing cultivation system of the Azure Continent shared a common root with the Wilds!However, because the spiritual energy of the Azure Continent was practically depleted, the people spoke only of \u201cthe Martial and Origin Daos\u201d, the first two realms along the path of cultivation.As for the two higher realms of cultivation, the \u201cSpirit Dao\u201d and \u201cProfound Dao\u201d, there was practically no trace of them on the Azure Continent. They only existed in legends.Rumor had it that the mightiest experts of the Great Zhou were only in the Origin Dao stage.Despite this, the common folk honored them as \u201cEarthly Immortals.\u201dFrom this, it was easy to infer just how barren and sparse the Azure Continent\u2019s spiritual energy was.Su Yi pondered out loud, \u201cEven if I have countless techniques and remarkable abilities at my disposal, I reincarnated into such a barren place that most aren\u2019t usable\u2026.\u201dBut he wasn\u2019t actually worried about all that.The way of cultivation undoubtedly came down to four key words: wealth, companions, techniques, and land.\u201cIf I can find a place with concentrated spiritual energy, I can cut my work in half for twice the results.\u201cAnd if I can find a few treasures of heaven and earth on top of that, I\u2019ll need three months at most to break past the Martial Dao and step into the Origin Dao\u2026.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s thoughts stopped here. \u201cI\u2019m getting ahead of myself,\u201d he said with a self-deprecating laugh. \u201cWith the sparse spiritual energy of the Great Zhou, giving rise to elixirs on the level of \u2018treasures of heaven and earth\u2019 is all but impossible.\u201cBut realizing my dao in this spiritually-depleted landscape will prove my abilities as Su Xuanjun. Only then will I have a chance to reach greater heights than in my past life!\u201dWhy had he reincarnated to cultivate anew?Naturally, it was a plan to reach an even higher realm than in his past life!\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll take a trip outside the city and see if I can find a \u2018spiritual ground\u2019 suitable for cultivation.\u201d Having made up his mind, Su Yi looked up. His carefree gaze reflected the bright moon hovering overhead, and when its radiance lit up his pupils, there was a hint of an altogether different emotion visible there.Seth's ThoughtsCultural notes if you\u2019re curious:The \u201cpine and crane\u201d are both traditional symbols of longevity. It makes sense that pines would symbolize longevity; they\u2019re evergreens, resistant to cold (and presumably other hardships), and many species of pine really do live a long time. There\u2019s a tree in California, \u201cMethuselah\u201d, that\u2019s almost five thousand years old already.As for cranes, there are legends of daoists turning into cranes upon death, or of cranes carrying the souls of the dead to the next realm. Cranes can also represent purity, among other things. You\u2019ll often see them paired with pines in traditional Chinese art.\u201cAn\u0101srava\u201d is a Buddhist term, presumably from Sanskrit. It doesn\u2019t imply perfection as in \u201comnipotence\u201d or \u201cmoral superiority\u201d so much as the absence of contaminants.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - A Chance Encounter on the RiverbankA vast river flowed swiftly outside of Guangling City, its waters ten thousand feet across.This was the Great Azure River, the longest river in Cloudriver Prefecture, which twisted and turned across thousands of miles.It was currently early in the morning.Su Yi was clad in blue cloth, traveling north along the banks of the Great Azure.As he walked, he sensed the changes in the ambient spiritual energy. He surveyed the landscape and inspected the heavenly and earthly phenomena.This was the geomancy of wind and water, \u201cFeng shui.\u201dAlthough Su Yi currently had no cultivation, he still had the experience and outlook of his past life.Thus, as he strolled past mountains and rivers, he could discern the shifts in spiritual energy distribution. It differed everywhere you went.He walked over ten miles along the river. Finally, he stopped in place, a hint of satisfaction in his gaze.Before him stood an enormous stretch of mountains, the peaks closely clustered together and shrouded in mist year-round.The Azurecloud Mountains.They stretched for eight hundred miles along the banks of the Great Azure.If I go any further, I\u2019ll enter the Azurecloud Mountains\u2019 \u2018Mother Ghost Ridge\u2019, the place the people of Guangling City tremble whenever they speak of\u2026.\u00a0Su Yi stood with his hands behind his back and gazed into the distance.Mother Ghost Ridge had been seen as a land of mysterious dangers for years.Rumor had it that, a long time ago, it had been the site of a brutal battle. The malevolent yin energy was so dense that, apparently, vicious apparitions emerged from its forests on a regular basis.Most of the ghost stories circulated throughout Guangling City involved Mother Ghost Ridge.The mountains are locked in yin energies, and the malevolent fog cannot disperse. This really is a \u2018blessed land\u2019 for producing violent ghosts.After a moment, Su Yi retracted his gaze and sighed to himself,\u00a0It\u2019s a pity that I still don\u2019t have any cultivation. Otherwise, I could go in, look around, and grab a few vicious ghosts to help me search the mountains for spiritual medicines. Then, I wouldn\u2019t have to go to all this trouble to find a secluded cultivation site outside city limits\u2026This world really did have ghosts!Furthermore, Su Yi knew that ghosts were divided into categories: yin spirits, haunts, specters, and phantasms.In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, the \u201cGhost Emperor of the Western Seas\u201d was the most mysterious ghost of all. He started out as an ordinary ghost born on an ancient battlefield, only to become a legend among ghost cultivators.Although the spiritual energy here is still rather sparse, at my current level, it\u2019s plenty.\u00a0In the end, Su Yi decided to cultivate here.This was a mulberry grove adjacent to the Great Azure riverbed. The Azurecloud Mountains stood before him. Both the winds and waters flowed into the mountains, a place where rivers\u00a0converged. It was, albeit barely, a \u201cspiritual ground.\u201dWind drifted by. The flow of spiritual energy in the air was pleasant and relaxing.Haaah~!\u00a0Su Li let out a long breath of turbid air. His mind and body gradually turned clear and ethereal, like a full moon against blue skies.Then, he gradually took up his stance and began practicing the Pine and Crane Body Refining art.It really is different from cultivating in the Wen Family estate\u2026.\u00a0Just a few seconds later, Su Yi noticed that within a hundred meters around him, wisp after wisp of sparse spiritual energy was flowing towards him and fusing into his body.It was as silent and nourishing as a spring breeze and gentle rain.His blood and energy mellowed, yet they felt full and vibrant, as if they were rejoicing. He felt an abundance of vitality.Su Yi cast aside his scattered thoughts and immersed himself in his cultivation, forgetting himself completely.Before long, the sun was high in the sky. It was already noon.Su Yi had cultivated for a full six hours!Fortunately, this mulberry grove was extremely remote, and due to its close proximity to Mother Ghost Ridge, people rarely visited. No one had disrupted Su Yi\u2019s cultivation.Pop!Suddenly, a crisp sound emanated from Su Yi\u2019s bones and tendons, as if he were chiseling out the barriers within his physical form. His blood and qi coursed through him like a surging river.His body now resembled an ancient pine, towering into the heavens!And his boiling, vibrant blood and qi resembled an immortal crane beating its wings, roaming about the blue skies utterly at ease. He brimmed with profound, indescribable charm.The pine and crane, suitable in stillness and movement. Truth and illusion mutually interconnected, both form and meaning!At this moment, Su Yi fully grasped the essence and charm of the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique.This also marked his entrance into the early stage of the Blood Circulation Realm!Blood Circulation was the first realm of the Martial Dao, the beginning of cultivation, the foundation of the Great Dao. It was subdivided into four layers: Refining Skin, Refining Muscle, Refining Sinew, and Refining Bone.Now, one year after losing everything, Su Yi had a cultivation once more!Clang!A familiar sword hum reverberated through Su Yi\u2019s sea of consciousness, revealing delight and excitement.The Sword of the Nine Hells!\u201cAre you happy for me too\u2026..?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s expression subtly shifted.In his past life, the Sword of the Nine Hells had accompanied him from the moment he first started cultivating. It was by his side as he fought grand battles and pursued the Dao.But even just before his reincarnation and with the terrifying \u201cProfound Unity Realm\u201d cultivation that struck terror into the hearts of the Wilds, he couldn\u2019t see through the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2019 true nature or discern its secrets.Its origin.Its nine seals, its divine shackles.Its mysterious hues.Su Yi could set aside the fame and vast wealth he\u2019d accumulated over the course of his lifetime.The only thing he couldn\u2019t give up was the Sword of the Nine Hells!Thus, before his reincarnation, Su Yi didn\u2019t hesitate to seal his lifetime of memories within the blade and have it reincarnate alongside him.His sword was his life; he couldn\u2019t part from it!Before long, Su Yi shook his head, calmed his heart, and examined his changes. \u201cBreathing in spiritual energy as I cultivate really makes an enormous difference.\u201dAfter reawakening his memories, he\u2019d spent three days bitterly cultivating within the Wen Family estate.But even added together, his three full days of work paled in comparison to the six hours he\u2019d spent cultivating by the banks of the Great Azure.The difference was night and day!\u201cIf I cultivate here, it\u2019ll only take me three days to reach the pinnacle of the \u2018Refining Skin\u2019 stage.\u201dAs soon as this thought occurred to him, Su Yi shook his head.\u00a0If all I have to do is increase my cultivation boundary, it\u2019ll be as easy as turning over my palm. But I reincarnated to cultivate afresh in pursuit of a dao that transcends my past life!With every step I take, I have to ensure that my cultivation is solid and stable. I have to strengthen my foundations.Su Yi warned himself,\u00a0Whatever I do, I cannot be impatient.Blood Circulation was the first realm of the Martial Dao.This was the most fundamental realm, as well as the most important. The foundation he established here would influence his future path and determine how far down it he could walk.He was using the Pine and Crane Body Refining Art to ensure that, in the Four Realms of the Martial Dao, he hammered out a foundation that far surpassed his former self at the same stage!Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a penny to my name. If I had enough money, I could buy some herbal medicines. Then, after a day\u2019s cultivation, I could soak in a medicinal bath and refine the medicines\u2019 essences. That would improve and enhance my physique even further.Going forward, I\u2019ll have to find an opportunity to earn a little money\u2026.Just as Su Yi was mulling over his future cultivation, he heard a burst of violent coughing drift in on the wind.Su Yi turned towards Mother Ghost Ridge and saw two distant figures walking towards him, an old man in long robes, and a young woman clad in purple.The long-robed elder\u2019s steps were weak, and his gaunt face was pallid. As he walked, he coughed so violently, he could barely breathe.The young woman in purple walked by his side, her radiant, egg-shaped face fraught with concern.Her purple clothes fluttered about, and a white jade belt wrapped around her waist. She was tall and slender, with an exceptional figure.Even more unusual, she had an uncommon, distinct air of nobility.Both the old man and the girl are clearly long-accustomed to rank and power.\u00a0Su Yi glanced at them, then looked away.However, just as he was about to leave, he paused, then turned to look at the long-robed elder once more.He instantly discovered something, and despite himself, a hint of bewilderment flashed through his eyes.Both the elder and the girl had long since noticed Su Yi. At first, neither of them paid him any heed.But when Su Yi turned back around to re-examine the elder, the girl couldn\u2019t help but frown. A gloomy look came over her beautiful face. \u201cSly and shifty. One look, and I can tell he\u2019s no good!\u201dHer pretty features frosted over, and she glared at Su Yi.He was stunned.\u00a0This girl\u2019s got quite the temper!\u201cZi Jin, don\u2019t be rude. No matter how worried you are about my injuries, you can\u2019t vent your anger on the innocent.\u201d The long-robed elder\u2019s voice was gentle and kindly. \u201cAs you conduct your affairs, subdue yourself and observe propriety. If it\u2019s not proper, don\u2019t say it. Only then can your spirit remain calm, and only then can you avoid the pitfalls of the heart\u2019s\u00a0six thieves.\u201dThe girl he called Zi Jin grimaced. \u201cGrandpa, your wounds are so severe, yet you\u2019re still lecturing me? How could I possibly be in the mood to listen?\u201dThe elder couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Then, he turned to Su Yi and briefly cupped his fist. \u201cMy young friend, if we offended you, I humbly request your forgiveness.\u201dAs he spoke, he suddenly broke into another violent bout of coughing. The veins\u00a0bulged\u00a0on his forehead; it was as if he were about to hack up a lung.\u201cGrandpa, you shouldn\u2019t talk anymore!\u201d Zi Jin\u2019s pretty face was frantic and fraught with worry. She carefully took her grandfather\u2019s arm and helped him up. \u201cOnce we get back to the city, I\u2019ll find the best physician around to treat your wounds.\u201dIt was then that Su Yi interjected, \u201cWith wounds like that, an ordinary physician won\u2019t be able to save you. If you delay any longer, you\u2019re certain to succumb to your injuries within three days.\u201dZi Jin was so mad, her eyes bulged, and she roared, \u201cWhat gall! Are you cursing my grandfather to die?\u201dThe elder, however, merely grimaced. \u201cZi Jin, he\u2019s right. My wounds are all but untreatable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d It was as if she\u2019d been struck by lightning. Zi Jin sunk into despair, and her voice quivered, \u201cGrandpa, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll let anything happen to you! I\u2019ll take you back to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital right away!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d said the long-robed elder with a smile. \u201cThe heavens determine our fate. I spent my life on the battlefield, and I\u2019ve long since lost my fear of death.\u201dThen, the elder\u2019s gaze returned to Su Yi, and he asked in mild bewilderment, \u201cMy young friend, might I be so bold as to ask how you determined the severity of this old man\u2019s injuries?\u201dSu Yi\u2019s impression of him was rather decent, so he didn\u2019t hide anything. \u201cA scarlet flush between the brows, a pallid, bloodless complexion. Yin poison has invaded your lungs. Combine that with a lingering air of death, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, you encountered a \u2018Six\u00a0Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse\u2019 in Mother Ghost Ridge.\u201dThe long-robed elder was visibly moved. \u201cGood eyes!\u201dZu Jin couldn\u2019t help but chime in, \u201cSomething\u2019s not right! Grandpa, didn\u2019t you say that in Cloudriver Prefecture, very few people know that the Azurecloud Mountains\u2019 Mother Ghost Ridge can give rise to Six Severing Yin Corpses?\u201dShe was right; that was precisely why her grandfather was so surprised.Never mind Guangling City; throughout all of Cloudriver Pefecture, practically no one knew this secret.Yet the youth before them had, after one look at his injuries, seen through their source!Su Yi said flatly, \u201cDiscerning that isn\u2019t much. I can even say with certainty that you came here to pluck \u2018Six Yin Grass\u2019 and \u2018Extreme Yang Flowers.\u2019\u201dZi Jin\u2019s eyes widened, and she asked without thinking, \u201cHow could you possibly know that?\u201dThe long-robed elder\u2019s expression changed too. Tidal waves of astonishment rose within his heart.A youth he\u2019d bumped into by chance had, just by looking, determined both the nature of his wounds and the purpose of this expedition.Wasn\u2019t that a bit\u00a0too\u00a0terrifying!?\u201cHow could I possibly know that?\u201d Su Yi shook his head with a faint sneer. \u201cGirl, don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know that anywhere capable of giving rise to Six Severing Yin Corpses is sure to grow Six Yin Grass? It\u2019s a spiritual medicine of extreme yin and extreme chill. And you know what they say; Yin cannot exist without Yang, and Yang cannot grow without Yin. Wherever Six Yin Grass grows, Extreme Yang Flowers are sure to follow.\u201dIn the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, this sort of thing was common knowledge!Yet it was obvious that Zi Jin was too stunned to even speak.Even the long-robed elder\u2019s expression filled with unconcealed shock.In their eyes, the tall, gaunt youth before them suddenly had a newfound, inscrutable air about him.Seth's ThoughtsThe Six Thieves is a Buddhist term. Sometimes, it\u2019s Five Thieves instead. It seems similar terms are used in Sikhism and other religions. The phrase refers to human weaknesses, called \u201cthieves\u201d because they steal a person\u2019s common sense. I suggest consulting the\u00a0Wikipedia page\u00a0if you want to know more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - A Mystical Immortal AirThe long-robed elder quickly calmed down.He\u2019d spent his life warring across the realm, and he\u2019d experienced slaughter and bloodshed. What types of wind and rain\u00a0hadn\u2019t\u00a0he overcome?He knew better than anyone that unbelievable methods, eccentric masters, and rare geniuses existed in great abundance.The youth before him was undoubtedly not simple in the least!\u201cYou were tailing us in secret earlier, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Zi Jin scrunched up her brow.The long-robed elder was at a loss for words. Before Su Yi could respond, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, girl. Given our young friend\u2019s talents, how could he do something so shameful?\u201dAs he spoke, he turned to Su Yi and cupped his fist. His eyes carried a hint of admiration. \u201cMy young friend, might I ask if you\u2019ve noticed anything else?\u201dGrandfather, he\u2026..\u00a0Zi Jin\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief.With her grandfather\u2019s status, even if you searched all nineteen cities of Cloudriver Prefecture, who was worthy of him \u201ccupping his fist in respect\u201d?She couldn\u2019t help but take a second glance at Su Yi. He was tall and thin, with handsome features. He wasn\u2019t at all bad-looking.However, his presence was slack and ordinary, as if he didn\u2019t have any cultivation at all\u2026.Could it be that\u2026.His cultivation is so lofty and profound that it\u2019s impossible to discern? Could he really be so terrifying?Zi Jin\u2019s family background was exceptional, and from a young age, she\u2019d heard her elders\u2019 tales of Earthly Immortals. They might look ordinary, but in truth, they\u2019d long since transcended the Martial Dao. They were terrifying beings of enormous power!Is it possible that this is no mere youth, but rather an elder capable of maintaining a youthful appearance?When this thought occurred to her, Zi Jin\u2019s heart shook, and a hint of bewilderment appeared on her face.Su Yi would never have guessed that a mere cupped fist would give rise to so many thoughts in Zi Jin\u2019s mind.In the face of the long-robed elder\u2019s questions, he said calmly, \u201cPardon my rudeness, but at your third level \u2018Inner Furnace\u2019 cultivation, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to break through even if you pluck both Six Yin Grass and Extreme Yang Flowers.\u201dSu Yi paused for a moment, then continued, \u201cOr rather, you\u2019ve most likely long-since known that with your age and foundations, there\u2019s no way you can take so much as a single step further down the Martial Dao by relying on ordinary cultivation methods. That\u2019s why you decided to use the power of these two spiritual medicines to forcibly break through, right?\u201dThe long-robed elder froze, and he felt a chill run down his spine. It was as if he\u2019d been laid entirely bare, and Su Yi could see through all of his secrets.When Su Yi first guessed the source of his wounds and the purpose of this expedition, the old man only half believed him.But now, he was absolutely certain that this youth was an expert!\u201cGrandpa, how does he know all that?\u201d Zi Jin couldn\u2019t help but call out. She\u2019d lost control of her emotions, and her extraordinarily beautiful face was awash with shock.But after reawakening the memories of his past life, such a simple deduction was simple for Su Yi.\u201cSir, your insight is astounding. I can\u2019t help but admire you!\u201dThe long-robed elder sighed and cupped his fist in respect once more. Even his form of address had changed; he no longer called Su Yi \u201cyoung friend\u201d, nor did he dare put on airs.Su Yi inwardly nodded.The Inner Furnace Realm was also known as the Grandmaster Realm!With his current incarnation\u2019s seventeen years of life experience, he knew full well that with the elder\u2019s status as a \u201cGrandmaster of the Martial Dao\u201d, he wasn\u2019t just impressive by Guangling City\u2019s standards; he was like a giant of Cloudriver Prefecture!After all, in a spiritually-barren land like the Great Zhou, reaching the Grandmaster level was enough to earn you a noble title and intimidate an entire region.Despite the long-robed elder\u2019s status, he was treating Su Yi with respect. That alone was a rare sight.\u201cSir, if you can determine my grandfather\u2019s injuries, you must know a way to treat them and save his life, right?\u201d Zi Jin couldn\u2019t help but ask. Her tender beauty and goose egg-shaped face lit up with expectation. A Grandmaster was like a dragon; the masses could only look up to them.Sometimes, a single person could determine the rise and fall of a peak-level clan!And her grandfather was no ordinary Martial Dao Grandmaster, either.If he died from his wounds, it was sure to deal a devastating blow to their entire family!Zi Jin was frantic with worry. When she saw Su Yi\u2019s seemingly miraculous abilities, she felt as if she\u2019d clutched her last thread of hope.The long-robed elder felt a thread of hope too. He cupped his fist once more and said solemnly, \u201cThis old-timer is called Xiao Tianque. Within Cloudriver Prefecture, I\u2019m somewhat well known. If you can save my life, I won\u2019t forget the favor!\u201dHe was a mighty Grandmaster of the Martial Dao, and had been for many years. He was well-aware that even another Grandmaster couldn\u2019t possibly have seen through his injuries at a glance!This alone was enough for him to consider Su Yi \u201cmysterious and inscrutable.\u201d\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t treat such trifling wounds, why would I bother saying all that?\u201d Su Yi laughed. Xiao Tianque and his granddaughter both lit up.\u201cSo long as you can treat my wounds, you can ask for anything you\u2019d like in exchange. I won\u2019t refuse any request!\u201d Xiao Tianque\u2019s expression was utterly grave as he made his solemn vow.But on the inside, he felt great trepidation.The way he saw it, with Su Yi\u2019s miraculous abilities, ordinary compensation would be nowhere near enough!But he was in no position to concern himself with that. He\u2019d do whatever it took to live through this, no matter the cost!Su Yi mulled it over, then said, \u201cFrom your perspective, this might be lifesaving benevolence, but to me, this is but a trifle. How about this? Just give me a token \u2018consultation fee\u2019, whatever you see fit.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Both Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin were stunned. Their eyes widened, and they dared not believe their ears.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d Zi Jin hurriedly shook her head, her expression strange. She stuttered, \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t\u2026 wouldn\u2019t have expected it to be so\u2026 so\u2026. Simple\u2026.\u201dHer voice trailed off, and she sounded embarrassed.Su Yi didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\u00a0I can fix this with a snap of my fingers. Why make it difficult for you?Xiao Tianque let out a long sigh, and he smiled bitterly. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, lass. Someone of his level doesn\u2019t care about a bit of money. He\u2019s simply doing this so we don\u2019t owe him a favor.\u201d\u201cAh, so that\u2019s it.\u201d Zi Jin instantly felt enlightened.That was so like an expert; he naturally didn\u2019t need favors from people of their level!Zi Jin hurriedly took a silver note from her purse and presented it respectfully with both hands. Voice chattering, she said, \u201cSir, here is a ten-thousand-tael silver note. It's a token of our appreciation, so please accept it.\u201dTen thousand taels? And they\u2019re just handing it over casually?\u00a0Despite himself, Su Yi was stunned. Only then did he realize that this grandfather-granddaughter duo was far wealthier than he imagined.It\u2019s worth noting that the Wen Family, as one of the Three Great Clans of Guangling City, only gave Wen Lingzhao and Wen Lingxue three hundred\u00a0taels\u00a0of spending money per month.\u201cTen thousand is too much.\u201d Su Yi shook his head. Although he was in dire need of money to buy medicinal ingredients, he disdained making a fortune off something like this.When Xiao Tianque saw this, he sighed inwardly. He was increasingly certain that the lofty expert before him didn\u2019t care about money at all.Or in other words, to this mysterious youth, saving his life and treating his wounds\u2026. Was really no big deal!He wasn\u2019t greedy for wealth, nor did he want them to owe him a favor, yet he could see through him at a glance. If this wasn\u2019t an expert straight out of a legend, Xiao Tianque would even be willing to pluck out his own eyes! In an instant, he became even more respectful toward Su Yi.He was a wily old-timer, and farsighted, too. He inwardly decided that, once his wounds healed, he\u2019d build a relationship with this lofty expert, no matter what!But Zi Jin seemed troubled. She whispered, \u201cBut ten-thousand-tael notes are the smallest I have on me.\u201dSu Yi was at a loss for words.\u00a0How wealthy does a family of the Great Zhou have to be for a little girl like this to be so showy with her money?But before he could say anything, Xiao Tianque said solemnly, \u201cSir, to the ordinary citizens of this world, ten thousand taels of silver is indeed a massive sum. However, to me, it\u2019s nothing at all, nor is it anywhere near enough to express my gratitude.\u201cIt\u2019s just as you said: to you, this is naught but a trifle, but to me, this is life-saving kindness!\u201dWith that, he bowed at the waist and said sincerely, \u201cPlease, accept it. Only then can my granddaughter and I feel at ease.\u201dWhen she saw her grandfather bow with such politeness, Zi Jin was frantic. \u201cSir, you might laugh when I say this, but within the Great Zhou, one million taels of gold isn\u2019t enough to exchange for the life of a Grandmaster like my grandfather, nevermind a mere ten thousand taels of silver.\u201cPlease\u2026.. Accept it. Otherwise, my grandfather will spend his life tormented by guilt.\u201d As she spoke, she, too, bowed and proffered the silver note.Su Yi felt a bit ridiculous.He\u2019d thought this a trifle, a snap of his fingers.\u00a0Who would have thought they\u2019d be so determined to throw money at me\u2026?He couldn\u2019t be bothered to refuse, so he simply accepted it and smiled. \u201cAlright, you two needn\u2019t be so courteous going forward, or this \u2018consultation fee\u2019 will burn my fingers.\u201dXiao Tianque hurriedly rose, his face nothing but smiles.Zi Jin sighed in relief. Her brow visibly relaxed, and she looked delighted.\u201cIf you want to treat your wounds, in addition to taking medicine for a week, you\u2019ll need to use a secret art to cleanse your body of corpse poison. Only then can you eliminate all latent danger.\u201d As Su Yi spoke, he wrote out a prescription. It included over thirty types of medicinal herbs in total, but none of them were particularly rare or valuable.The only item on the list that was the least bit precious was the ten-year-molt of a Jade Toad.But Su Yi trusted that something like that wouldn\u2019t trouble a Grandmaster like Xiao Tianque.\u201cThank you for writing me the recipe!\u201d Xiao Tianque held the prescription firmly and bowed once more, his heart full of excitement.Su Yi nodded. \u201cTake this medicine for seven days. After the week is up, wait for me here, and I\u2019ll help you completely disperse any poison lingering within your body.\u201d\u201cI have other matters to attend to, so I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d With that, he turned and left.Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin watched until he faded into the distance. Only then did Zi Jin seem to come to her senses. Her pretty eyes darted about, and she whispered, \u201cGrandpa, if not for him seeing through your secrets, I\u2019d be certain he was a scam artist.\u201dXiao Tianque snorted derisively. \u201cGirl, don\u2019t take nonsense. Ten thousand taels of silver, that\u2019s all! How could a man like that care about such a paltry sum? Look at how he carries himself! He\u2019s truly got the air of an immortal!\u201cRemember: next time you see him, you need to be more modest and respectful. You cannot be the least bit negligent!\u201d As he reached the end of his warning, the old man\u2019s gaze turned utterly severe.Zi Jin stuck out her tongue, but she said obediently, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Grandpa. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dXiao Tianque grunted, then sighed with emotion, \u201cAnd here I thought I\u2019d only have a few days to live after returning from Mother Ghost Ridge. Who would have thought I\u2019d have a chance encounter with such a lofty figure? He showed me the right path and wrote out a prescription. What\u2026. What did I do to deserve such fortune?\u201dSuddenly, he hit himself on the head, and he looked vexed, as if he\u2019d only just remembered something. \u201cI must be going senile! Just now, I forgot to ask that gentleman his name!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - A Young Woman\u2019s BirthdaySo, a Six\u00a0Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse appeared within Mother Ghost Ridge. That means there\u2019s got to be an inauspicious yin spirit vein hidden there!That\u2019s the only way the ghosts there could undergo \u2018corpse transformation\u2019, slough off their old forms, and become Six\u00a0Severings\u00a0Yin Corpses.Even in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, yin-aligned spirit veins are rare and unusual, yet one appeared within the territory of the spiritually barren Great Zhou. It\u2019s practically a miracle\u2026..As Su Yi pondered, he walked towards Guangling City along the banks of the Great Azure.The third Realm of the Martial Dao is the \u2018Inner Furnace.\u2019 If I use a yin-aligned spirit vein to temper my internal organs, I\u2019ll achieve twice the results for half the work.That aside, Mother Ghost Ridge has Six Yin Grass and Extreme Yang Flowers. Those are precious medicines for Inner Furnace Realm cultivators.Once I\u2019ve reached the pinnacle of the Blood Circulation Realm, I\u2019ll have to go in and take a look around.\u00a0Su Yi made up his mind.He\u2019d left his chance encounter with Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin with an ample harvest.Ten thousand taels of silver was enough to purchase the medicines he needed to temper his body.At the same time, he\u2019d intuited some enormously valuable intelligence regarding Mother Ghost Ridge.Such as the presence of an inauspicious yin spirit vein!When Su Yi arrived at Guangling City, he saw the city lord\u2019s\u2019 guards garrisoned outside its gates.They were fully armored, and they looked stern, vigorous, and fully capable.Before the guards, another group of the city\u2019s higher-ups had gathered, all of them of extraordinary bearing; they were clearly long accustomed to power. Ordinary experts of the Martial Day couldn\u2019t compare with them at all.Such a grand military formation was a rare sight in Guangling City.The citizens passing through the gates were, without exception, both curious and awed. The sound of discussion filled the air.\u201cThe City Lord is here, and he even dispatched his Old Guard. What\u2019s all this for?\u201dAh, so that\u2019s City Lord Fu Shan and his Old Guard\u2026\u2026\u00a0Su Yi was inwardly curious too, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to ask around. He went straight for the gates and walked inside.He could dimly discern the sound of the gathered experts\u2019 laughter and conversation emanating from behind him\u2014\u201cLook! Isn\u2019t that the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law, Su Yi? He was once the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, a rare genius.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really a pity.\u201d\u201cA pity? Way I see it, if you want to pity someone, it ought to be Wen Lingzhao. I\u2019ve never seen such immense talent\u00a0for the Martial\u00a0Dao in all my life, and her good looks are one in ten thousand! Despite all that, she married Su Yi of all people. What a tragedy!\u201d\u2026\u2026Su Yi laughed, but he wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned. He quickly disappeared into the bustling city streets.Not long after.Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin appeared a ways beyond the city gates.At almost the same time, the Lord of Guangling City, Fu Shan, stepped forward and bowed in solemn greeting, his voice booming through the clouds. \u201cYour humble subordinate Fu Shan greets you, Marquis. Greetings, Young Marchioness!\u201dThe experts and higher-ups behind Fu Shan, as well as his entire team of elite armed guards, quivered and repeated the greeting. \u201cGreetings, Marquis. Greetings, Young Marchioness!\u201dSuddenly, the city gates fell silent. It was so still and quiet, not even the birds chirped.The flow of citizens passing through the gates sunk into terrified silence.Xiao Tianque stood a short distance away, his hands behind his back and his eyes closed. He unconsciously emanated an air of authority; this was the bearing of one long accustomed to power.Turning our attention to Zi Jin, she stood with her back straight. Her figure was still tall and slender, and her egg-shaped face was still peerlessly beautiful, but she had a reserved, honorable bearing, as if she were a thousand miles away and unapproachable.\u201cFu Shan, I haven\u2019t been a marquis for a long time. Have the others step back; don\u2019t disturb the populace!\u201d Xiao Tianque furrowed his brow.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d City Lord Fu Shan agreed, then waved to the others. The city\u2019s major powers and the Old Guard left right away, not daring to delay.\u201cUncle Fu, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to gather the medicinal ingredients listed on this recipe. Remember, we need enough for seven days. Also, please prepare a secluded room for my grandfather and I, somewhere we won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d Zi Jin stepped forward and handed Fu Shan Su Yi\u2019s prescription.\u201cPrincess, your subordinate shall carry out your orders with the utmost precision!\u201d City Lord Fu Shan solemnly cupped his fist and bowed.Xiao Tianque nodded, but said no more. He and Zi Jin proceeded through the city gates.Gu Shan hurriedly followed them. Only when they\u2019d all left did the citizens near the gates come to their senses, as if awakening from a dream. Immediately afterward, they broke into fervent discussion.Fu Shan was the lord of Guangling City, its highest authority figure. Even Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans had to treat him with respect.Yet now, right before their very eyes, he\u2019d treated an old man and young woman with the utmost respect, heeding their every command!Witnessing this broadened the citizens\u2019 horizons, and they busily speculated at Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin\u2019s identities.\u2026\u2026The Wen Family.Su Yi sat in a tub within his chambers.His eyes were shut, and with every breath, a faint wisp of white gas wound around him, like a snake flicking its tongue to a fantastical rhythm.This was the Pine and Crane Body Refining Art\u2019s breathing technique.The bathtub contained a hot medicinal bath, a mixture of over fifty different herbs and grasses heated for four hours.These medicinal herbs weren\u2019t \u201cspiritual medicines\u201d in the eyes of cultivators, yet every last one was exceedingly valuable. They were worth five hundred taels of silver in total.In Guangling City, a common family\u2019s annual expenses amounted to around a dozen taels at most!This was the origin of the saying \u201cthe poor pursue scholarship, the wealthy, martial arts.\u201dOnly the wealthy were qualified to cultivate the Martial Dao.Even if a commoner wanted to cultivate, they couldn\u2019t possibly bear the necessary expenditures.Even though the Wen Family was one of Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans, and even though they boasted over a thousand members, only a select few were qualified to cultivate the Martial Dao from a young age.There was nothing for it. Cultivating was just too expensive!Ordinary warriors took supplements to meet their bodies\u2019 needs on a daily basis. They needed to purchase all sorts of medicines to further their cultivations, and even entering an academy to cultivate represented an enormous expense.Ordinary families simply couldn\u2019t afford it.It was the same throughout the Great Zhou.Time flowed by, and soon, the sun cast slanted shadows from the west.Su Yi had spent a full six hours in meditation. Two straight streams of gas, like pristine white silk, shot from his nostrils.The streams of gas were like arrows. They shot ahead three feet, cutting through the air like knives with a faint rumbling reminiscent of thunder.His breathing was silken, yet it boomed like thunder!This distinctive effect was the result of circulating your qi throughout your body until it boiled.It was then that Su Yi opened his eyes, a flash of brilliance in the depths of his profound gaze, like the edge of a knife or a crackle of electricity. It flickered briefly, then disappeared.Today, I spent the morning breathing in the spiritual energy along the banks of the Great Azure, and the afternoon refining my body in a medicinal bath. Less than a day has passed, but my foundations within the Blood Circulation Realm are already completely solid\u2026..Su Yi got out of the bathtub, put on his clothes, and walked into the courtyard.The sun was setting, casting a layer of gentle light over the jujube trees of the garden.Su Yi stood firmly in place, sensing the power of his ample blood and qi. Suddenly, he stretched out his finger and stabbed it into the branch of the nearest tree.Wham!The entire branch shattered into powder.Strangely, the branch\u2019s green leaves floated to the ground, completely intact.Su Yi relaxed his finger and nodded to himself.In the beginning stages of the Martial Dao, cultivators refined their physiques, blood, and qi. Battles, however, were a display of both raw power and control.Powerful warriors could stick a spear right through a date still on the tree. One stab, one fruit.They could stab a fly without leaving a mark on the wall below.This was an exquisite application of power.Su Yi\u2019s finger attack was yet another example.His movement seemed ordinary, but he struck like an arrow\u00a0loosed\u00a0from a bow or a sudden crack of lightning!His finger shattered the branch with incredible ease, yet left the brittle, fragile leaves completely intact.This represented a superb level of refined control.But then, in his past life, a single finger could split an ocean, and a wave of his sleeves could sever mountains. By comparison, shattering a branch was nothing but a parlor trick.For the next few days, Su Yi left the city to cultivate along the riverbank every morning, and spent his evenings soaking in a medicinal bath to refine his physique. His physical power underwent an earth-shaking transformation.During this time, his younger sister-in-law, Wen Lingxue, returned to Pinecloud Sword Manor. Just before she left, she specifically reminded Su Yi that she\u2019d be turning sixteen in just a few days and that she hoped he\u2019d participate in the festivities. Su Yi agreed without hesitation.\u201cThe peak of the early-stage Blood Circulation Realm!\u201d That morning, as Su Yi left the banks of the Great Azure, he sensed his body\u2019s changes. Despite himself, a satisfied grin tugged at the corners of his lips.The Pinecloud Body Refining Technique really was the number one foundational technique of the Nine Provinces of the Wilds!After mastering its essence and profundities, he\u2019d undergone a dramatic transformation akin to rebirth in just five days. He\u2019d established a solid foundation for his future efforts in one fell swoop!Better yet, he was stronger than his past life had been at this level!With my current physical power, ordinary Blood Circulation Realm cultivators aren\u2019t even remotely comparable\u2026..\u00a0Su Yi still had his current incarnation\u2019s seventeen years of memories. After a brief comparison, he was certain\u2014Should they fight, even the peak Blood Circulation Realm disciples of the Blueriver Sword Manor would lose beyond a shadow of a doubt!The Blood Circulation Realm was, after all, only the first realm of the Martial Dao. Its cultivators refined their physiques, and although they were stronger than ordinary people, they were still well within the bounds of \u201cmortality.\u201dIn the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, the Four Realms of the Martial Dao were also known as \u201cShedding Mortality\u201d. The name represented a metamorphosis, a four-step sloughing of mortality.Only after breaking past the Four Realms of the Martial Dao and entering the Origin Dao could you call yourself a \u201cXiantian\u201d cultivator.At that level, a cultivator could subsist on dew and the light of dawn and abstain from food. They were qualitatively different from \u201cthe common man.\u201dFurthermore, in combat, they no longer competed with cultivation alone; they could use combat arts!With the experience and skills of his past life, even with no cultivation at all, Su Yi could obliterate a Blood Circulation Realm small fry in minutes.In just five days, I spent two thousand, five hundred taels of silver, yet I\u2019ve only just stepped past the threshold\u2026..I can already predict that going forward, the resources I need for my cultivation will increase exponentially. My expenditures will soar accordingly.Like it or not, it seems that even as I cultivate the Four Realms of the Martial Dao, I\u2019ll have to consider ways of earning money long-term.Wealth, companions, techniques, and land. These were a cultivator\u2019s basic needs.Of them, \u201cwealth\u201d came first!Su Yi was well aware that as his cultivation increased, the amount of \u201cwealth\u201d required would reach increasingly shocking heights.Of course, to cultivators, \u201cwealth\u201d didn\u2019t just refer to simple gold and silver; it included all types of cultivation resources.For example, spiritual medicines and materials, treasures, and pills, among others.\u201cIf I entered a faction of cultivators, I wouldn\u2019t need to worry over such a paltry sum\u2026.\u201d Su Yi sighed, then shook his head and cast those thoughts aside.At least for now, he wouldn\u2019t even consider leaving Guangling City.As he pondered, Su Yi found himself back at the Wen Family. When he entered the family estate, he saw a faint, distant figure waiting outside his door.Wen Lingxue.She was all dolled up. She wore a long, deep purple dress, and her hair was tied into a bun, displaying her extraordinarily beautiful face. Her clear, bright eyes shone like the stars.She stood with her hands behind her back, her gaze expectant, as pretty as could be. \u201cBrother-in-law.\u201dWhen she saw Su Yi in the distance, a smile blossomed on her face, and she waved to him in delight.At that moment, she was so beautiful, the sunlight seemed to dim by comparison.\u201cIsn\u2019t school still in session? What are you doing back here?\u201d Su Yi smiled and went up to greet her.\u201cToday is my birthday!\u201d A smile blossomed across Wen Lingxue\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve already booked a banquet hall at the Immortal Gathering House. Several of my classmates will be there. Let\u2019s get going!\u201dAs she spoke, she affectionately took Su Yi\u2019s arm and led him outside.Su Yi, however, felt rather guilty.He\u2019d spent the past few days thinking about nothing but cultivation. He\u2019d forgotten her birthday, which he really shouldn\u2019t have.He glanced at the girl beside him, and she looked at him expectantly. Her eyes were bright, and her fair features showed no sign of blaming him at all.However, this only made Su Yi feel worse.He thought it over, and in the end, he made up his mind\u2014This year, he was going to give an extraordinary birthday gift!Seth's ThoughtsJust a head\u2019s up:The Chinese for Zi Jin\u2019s title is \u541b\u4e3b, which is used for the daughter of a prefectural lord. It\u2019s often translated as some variation on \u201cprincess\u201d. For now, I decided to avoid the word \u201cprincess\u201d because it seems misleading to use that word for someone who isn\u2019t the literal child of a king of emperor.I chose \u201cMarchioness\u201d as an alternative since it\u2019s the female version of \u201cMarquis\u201d, her grandfather\u2019s title. The \u201cyoung\u201d is in there to indicate that she\u2019s the child of the prefectural lord/marquis, not the one in charge herself.That said, I am still reading ahead, and it is entirely possible that this title will prove inappropriate down the line, in which case I\u2019ll come back and change it. If so, I\u2019ll mention it in the comments before making the swap.It\u2019s not always possible to translate a term properly without knowing the context, but there\u2019s almost two thousand chapters of raws, and it\u2019ll be a little while longer before I catch up. I\u2019m working on it. Thanks for bearing with me in the meantime!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Nie Teng\u201cWenxue, you\u2019re not spending your birthday at home with your parents this year?\u201d Su Yi asked casually on their way to the Immortal Gathering House.\u201cI\u2019m sixteen years already. It\u2019s\u00a0my\u00a0birthday, so it\u2019s up to me to decide how I spend it.\u201d The girl beside him blinked her beautiful eyes, then smiled. \u201cBut later tonight, I\u2019ll celebrate with Mom and Dad.\u201dShe paused, then continued, \u201cBesides, my grandmother is turning eighty the day after tomorrow. That\u2019s a major birthday; my parents are busy preparing alongside the rest of the family. They have no time to worry about me.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and he nodded.Wen Lingxue\u2019s grandmother was the Wen Family\u2019s matriarch, Liang Wenbi. She occupied a transcendent position within the family; even Family Head Wen Changjing didn\u2019t dare go against her wishes.She was about to turn eighty; the Wen Family naturally dared not be negligent.\u201cHurry up, Brother-in-law. It\u2019s almost noon!\u201d It was clear Wen Lingxue could barely wait.\u201cAlright.\u201d Su Yi smiled as he caught up to her. At the end of the day, his little sister-in-law had only just turned sixteen, an age like a poem or painting, brimming with youthful vitality.The Immortal Gathering House.Guangling City\u2019s largest-scale, highest-level restaurant, considered the top establishment in town.Those who dined here were either rich or of noble birth.A common joke went that a single glass of wine at the Immortal Gathering House was comparable to ten years of a poor family\u2019s income!This was no mere exaggeration.When Su Yi and Wen Lingxue arrived, the attendants warmly guided them to a private room on the third floor. The decor was old-fashioned and the air smelled of incense.Seven or eight people were seated inside already. Aside from one lone young man, all of them were girls roughly fifteen years of age.When Wen Lingxue arrived, she immediately received a warm welcome.\u201cLingxue, you look stunning today! This is the gift I prepared for you. I hope you\u2019ll pass the test to cultivate at Blueriver Sword Manor soon!\u201d\u201cHee hee, if our classmates found out today was Pinecloud Sword Manor\u2019s number-one beauty\u2019s birthday, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019d stand in line just to deliver presents!\u201d\u2026..The girls gave her the presents they\u2019d prepared, chattering away as they did so. Their demeanor was both proper and zealous.Su Yi\u2019s gaze swept across the guests. One glance, and he could determine an awful lot.These classmates of Wen Lingxue\u2019s were all dressed to the nines, everything carefully chosen. It was obvious that they all had exceptional backgrounds and that they came from prominent families.Some were lively and generous, some were gentle and reserved, while others were valiant and noble\u2026. In terms of both appearance and bearing, all of them were extraordinary.However, presumably because Wen Lingxue was simply too well-dressed and too dazzlingly beautiful, when her classmates compared themselves to her, they all felt varying degrees of barely discernible envy.They hid their jealousy well, but they couldn\u2019t escape Su Yi\u2019s keen eyes.He couldn\u2019t help but find it funny.\u00a0Girls\u2019 friendships might seem close-knit, but in truth, all of them have a hidden agenda. Fortunately, it\u2019s all innocuous.\u201cNie Teng, what are you doing here?\u201d Wen Lingxue suddenly noticed the only boy among her guests. Her brows scrunched up, and her expression became noticeably colder.The vibrant atmosphere suddenly grew somewhat stifled.The youth in question wore robes decorated with jade. His eyes were bright, his eyebrows dashing, and his bearing noble.The young man smiled, then stepped forward to greet her. \u201cWenxue, it\u2019s your birthday. Here\u2019s a little something I prepared for you. Please accept it.\u201dHe held a box inlaid with gold and jade in both hands. He gingerly opened it, revealing a pale purple jade hairpin for all to see.Someone had expertly carved it into a Luan about to take flight. It was so exquisitely detailed, it looked alive. It was obvious at a glance that this was the work of a master artisan.\u201cThe \u2018Purple Luan Fluttering its Wings\u2019 Hairpin! It\u2019s Master Artisan Mo\u2019s proudest work, and he\u2019s one of the best craftsmen in the prefecture! They saw it\u2019s made of a natural Cold Purple Spirit Jade. The materials alone are worth three hundred gold!\u201cBut after passing through Master Artisan Mo\u2019s divine hands, it\u2019s likely worth thousands!\u201d One of the girls, whose make-up was particularly exquisite, lit up. She\u2019d determined the hairpin\u2019s origins at a glance.\u201cThis\u2026. Isn\u2019t that a bit\u00a0too\u00a0precious?\u201dThese girls all had illustrious backgrounds, but they couldn\u2019t help but click their tongues. Nie Teng\u2019s lavish spending left them shocked.Nie Teng was quite satisfied with this result. A faint smile spread across his face, and he asked gently, \u201cWenxue, do you like it? I prepared it specifically for you.\u201dWhen they heard this, the other girls\u2019 expressions shifted; they couldn\u2019t help but envy Wen Lingxue.Nie Teng.He was the son of the commander of the City Lord\u2019s Old Guard. His talent was outstanding, his bearing handsome and noble.He was just sixteen years old, but he was already the man of the hour at Pinecloud Sword Manor. Who knew how many girls admired him?A talented, handsome youth like him had just spent a thousand gold to purchase a jade hairpin as an expression of his admiration. This was an enormous honor for any girl.Who didn\u2019t hope for things like this to happen to them?Yet\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue\u2019s brow only furrowed even deeper, and her expression turned even frostier. \u201cThis gift is too precious for me to accept. You should keep it.\u201dNie Teng\u2019s smile froze, replaced by a hint of distress.However, before he could respond, Wen Lingxue called for everyone to take their seats. She even specifically requested that Su Yi sit beside her.From beginning to end, she left Nie Teng completely hanging.However, when they saw Nie Teng\u2019s predicament, some of the girls couldn\u2019t help themselves. They spoke up, one after another, and warmly invited him to sit down.Nie Teng quickly got his emotions under control and sat down with a smile, as if he\u2019d already completely forgotten about his earlier awkwardness.However, whenever his gaze landed on Su Yi, he felt an inexplicable discomfort.To tell the truth, it wasn\u2019t just Nie Teng. The girls were all baffled too.\u00a0Why did Wen Lingxue invite Su Yi of all people?Out of respect for her, they tacitly agreed not to say anything. Still, none of them took the initiative to greet Su Yi, much less to exchange pleasantries.If not for Wen Lingxue, they would never have consented to sit at the same table as him. Who wanted to get acquainted with the live-in son-in-law everyone laughed at?Thus, even though Su Yi was seated right there, it was as if he were invisible. They were ignoring him completely.\u201cBrother-in-law, they might ignore you, but I won\u2019t. Whatever you do, don\u2019t get upset.\u201d While the others weren\u2019t paying attention, Wen Lingxue whispered in Su Yi\u2019s ear.Her breath was like the touch of an orchid, and her eyes were bright and lustrous. Her little face was fraught with concern as she tried to comfort him.Su Yi didn\u2019t quite know what to say.He had the mental fortitude of two lives. Why would he care about something like this?Before long, a group of beautiful maidservants walked into the room carrying a sumptuous array of dishes. All of them were rarely seen delicacies.Wen Lingxue tilted her head in confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t order that much food!\u201dNie Teng seemed to perk up, and he said heartily, \u201cWenxue, today is your birthday. How could we let you spend money on us? Our day at the Immortal Gathering House is entirely on me.\u201dHis gaze swept across the other girls, and he put on a lofty air. \u201cEveryone, please eat and drink to your heart\u2019s content. Enjoying yourself is the best way to congratulate Wenxue.\u201dThe girls laughed delightedly. Although their backgrounds were exceptional, they couldn\u2019t just dine at a money-pit like the Immortal Gathering House all willy-willy.Wen Lingxue, however, was not impressed. She said coldly, \u201cHow much did this cost? I\u2019ll reimburse you later on.\u201dNie Teng laughed. \u201cWenxue, don\u2019t be so distant. It\u2019s just one meal. If you really pay me back, when I next return to Pinecloud Sword Manor, the other guys will curse me to death.\u201dQuite a few of the girls laughed and chimed in their agreement, urging Wen Lingxue not to worry about it.Wen Lingxue hesitated, but in the end, she decided not to say anything more.She did, however, whisper in Su Yi\u2019s ear, \u201cThis guy is always like this. At Pinecloud Sword Manor, he loves nothing more than showing off. There\u2019s nothing more irritating than vain guys like him!\u201cAlso, I never even invited him to the Immortal Gathering House; he showed up of his own accord. His skin sure is thick!\u201dSu Yi laughed. Vanity was a common affliction among youths, and it wasn\u2019t such a terrible vice.Suddenly, Nie Teng glanced over.He hadn\u2019t heard what Wen Lingxue said to Su Yi. He could, however, see her pink lips in the intimate act of whispering into Su Yi\u2019s ears!His smile froze, and he could no longer suppress the flames of his jealousy. He even felt the urge to get up, wallop Su Yi, and send him packing.Nie Teng forced down his envy and feigned relaxed, casual curiosity. \u201cSu Yi, you\u2019re Lingxue\u2019s brother-in-law, and this is her birthday party. I wonder what present you got for her?\u201dA faint, almost indiscernible hint of a smile tugged at Su Yi\u2019s lips.What kind of person was he? He could tell at a glance that this kid resented him and was trying to cause trouble!As expected, the others all looked over, all of them with different expressions. They could roughly guess that Nie Teng was interested in comparing gifts.Or perhaps, he was just seizing this opportunity to embarrass Su Yi.Now that they thought about it, what right did a live-in son-in-law have to sit at the same table as them?He was humiliating himself and he didn\u2019t even know it!This Nie Teng is really detestable!\u00a0Wen Lingxue was starting to get angry. She\u2019d long since realized that Su Yi had forgotten about her birthday. How could he possibly have prepared a present?Yet Nie Teng just\u00a0had\u00a0to bring it up!\u201cI almost forgot about Lingxue\u2019s birthday, which is why I didn\u2019t have time to prepare a present. However, I\u2019ll make it up to her later today, after we return home.\u201d As Su Yi spoke, he looked at Wen Lingxue.That was because his words were aimed at her; he didn\u2019t care a whit what the others thought of him.Wen Lingxue was briefly dazed. She pursed her pink lips, but inwardly, there were no words to describe her delight.\u00a0Brother-in-law, he\u2026. He cares about my birthday after all! Mm, that\u2019s right. He\u2019s just been busy lately, so he inadvertently overlooked it, that\u2019s all.As she thought this, her eyes lit up, and a smile gradually spread across her face.\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t bring a present\u2026.\u201d Nie Teng had finally found an opportunity to vent his bellyful of jealousy, and he couldn\u2019t resist poking fun. \u201cLingxue\u2019s been\u00a0so good to a mere live-in brother-in-law like you for nothing. Look at you! I wouldn\u2019t have guessed you\u2019d forget even her birthday!\u201dThe girls in attendance couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads.\u00a0You can\u2019t rely on a wall built in the mud. This Su Yi sure is inept!But now that I think about it, he\u2019s the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law, a man who lives by mooching off a woman. What kind of gift\u00a0could\u00a0a guy like that even give?Whatever it is, it\u2019s sure to pale in comparison to Senior Apprentice Brother Nie Teng\u2019s \u2018Jade Purple Luan Hairpin\u2019!I really don\u2019t get why\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue cares so much about a live-in brother-in-law like him\u2026.Many of the girls found it hard to understand, and in their hearts, they felt renewed disdain for Su Yi.Nie Teng saw all of this, and he finally relaxed. But just as he was considering whether or not to strike while the iron was hot and give Su Yi a few more good kicks\u2026.Bang!Someone shoved open the private dining room\u2019s tightly-shut door.Seth's ThoughtsJust FYI, the word I\u2019m translating as \u201cmatriarch\u201d is not the female equivalent of the word used for titles like \u201cPatriarch Reliance.\u201d\u8001\u592a\u541b means the mother of the family head (or other male authority figure). There\u2019s no direct English equivalent that I\u2019m aware of. The closest matches I could think of were \u201cmatriarch\u201d and \u201cgrande dame\u201d. I chose the former because it seemed more fitting for the setting, and because she really is a matriarch-like figure within the family.You might have seen them in other novels, but if not, a \u201cLuan\u201d is a mythological bird, similar to a phoenix, but not quite the same thing, hence the different translation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Worthy of Your YouthThe sound of the door swinging open was loud and violent. Everyone in the private dining room furrowed their brows.This was the Immortal Gathering House, the number-one restaurant in Guangling City!Who could be so brazen as to force their way in without so much as a greeting?Simply presumptuous!Everyone instinctively glanced toward the doorway. When they saw the new arrival, everyone\u2019s expressions shifted. Wen Lingxue and Nie Teng were no exceptions.What\u2019s he doing here?\u201cI heard Lingxue was celebrating her birthday here, so I decided to crash the party. Hahaha, I didn\u2019t startle you, did I?\u201dThe new arrival was a youth in resplendent robes. His long hair draped his back, and he was handsome, but he reeked of alcohol and wore an impudent grin on his face.Huang Qianjun!He was a direct-line disciple of the Huang Family, one of Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans. His father was the current head of the Huang Family, Huang Yunchong.His temperament was arrogant and unbridled, and he was always itching for a fight. Although he was only seventeen, he had a long list of wicked deeds to his name already. Who knew how much heaven\u2019s wrath and people\u2019s resentment he\u2019d incurred?However, thanks to his father\u2019s protection, he was alive and well to this day. His strong backing only aggravated his domineering arrogance.When they realized this new arrival was Huang Qianjun, the girls\u2019 initial anger disappeared, replaced with silent trepidation. A hint of panic flashed across their beautiful faces; they\u2019d long since heard this silkpants\u2019 ill reputation.Even\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue and Nie Teng scrunched up their brows, their gazes solemn.Disciples of major clans like them saw Huang Qianjun as a ruthless, tyrannical villain. None of them were willing to befriend him. Their only fear was not being quick enough to avoid him.The atmosphere in the private dining room was instantly as stifled as could be.Only Su Yi remained calm. He didn\u2019t recognize Huang Qianjun, but he could tell from the way Wen Lingxue\u2019s body went taut that she was inwardly flustered.Whoever this brazen, uninvited guest was, he clearly scared her.Wen Lingxue took a deep breath, then said coldly, \u201cHow does my birthday have anything to do with you? You\u2019d best leave right away!\u201d Her pretty face seemed coated in frost, and she made no attempt to hide her rejection and distaste.However, Huang Qianjun didn\u2019t seem to mind in the least. He brazenly looked her up and down, then laughed, \u201cTch, you sure are Wen Lingzhao\u2019s little sister. You\u2019re a top-notch beauty! Only someone like you is worthy of me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wen Lingxue\u2019s face went red, and her eyes blazed with fury.\u201cLook, everyone! Beauties sure are beauties. She\u2019s pretty as can be even when she\u2019s angry. If I marry her and bring her back home, my old man will surely be pleased, right?\u201d Huang Qianjun laughed wantonly.A group of guards trailed after him, and they smiled ambiguously.The girls in attendance were visibly terrified, and they subconsciously looked at Nie Teng, placing their hopes on this son of the commander of the guards.Nie Teng took a deep breath. He knew that, at a time like this, he had to take a stand. Otherwise, he\u2019d be too ashamed to ever raise his head again.He steeled himself and feigned calm. \u201cYoung Master Huang, this is the Immortal Gathering House. Please be respectful. Disrupting the peace doesn\u2019t do anyone any good.\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s smile instantly darkened, and his eyes glinted with explosive viciousness. \u201cWhat even are you? Who are you to lecture me?\u201dNie Teng\u2019s expression instantly turned unsightly. His face went ashen, then white. When he saw this, Su Yi realized that even Nie Teng was afraid of this brazen, ill-tempered youth.\u201cYoung Master, that\u2019s the son of the commander of the Old Guard, Nei Beihu. Your Honorable Father and Nie Beihu are acquaintances.\u201d One of the guards warned him, then grinned, \u201cBut how we handle this is entirely up to you.\u201d\u201cOh~!\u201d Huang Qianjun smiled, his eyes narrowed into slits. \u201cNie Teng, huh? I\u2019ll give you just one chance: get out of my sight this second. Or else, I\u2019d be perfectly happy to beat the crap out of you and fling onto the streets like a dead dog.\u201dHe was nothing but smiles, yet his words were incomparably imposing and vicious. \u201cWhen that happens, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll become the laughingstock of all of Guangling City. Your reputation will be in tatters, and you\u2019ll be too ashamed to raise your head ever again!\u201dNie Teng froze, and his fists unwittingly clenched so tight, his joints were white. The veins on the back of his hands bulged, and he felt indescribable shame and fury.Seeing this, the blood drained from the girls\u2019 faces, and they felt even more flustered and helpless.None of those in the private dining room had a background as lofty as Nie Teng\u2019s. Now, it seemed that he wasn\u2019t enough to resolve this. What could they do but panic?It was then that Wen Lingxue said icily, \u201cHuang Qianjun, what exactly is it that you want?\u201dHuang Qianjun burst into laughter and rubbed his hands together. His burning gaze bore into Wen Lingxue as he said, \u201cWhat a good question! Let\u2019s put it like this: in a bit, I\u2019ll have my old man pay the Wen Family a visit to propose a marriage alliance. After that, well\u2026 Let\u2019s just say we\u2019ll be family, you and I!\u201dHis guards all chimed in, one after the other:\u201cYou\u2019ve got good eyes, Young Master!\u201d\u201cEveryone, take a good look! That girl\u2019s going to be our young master\u2019s wife!\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019d best congratulate the young master in advance, haha!\u201dWen Lingxue was both ashamed and angry. Her almond eyes widened, and she gnashed her teeth. \u201cLudicrous! I\u2019d die before marrying a hoodlum like you!\u201dSu Yi silently rose to his feet, a hint of newfound iciness amidst his usual calm. He stood there silently, his gaze indifferent.Back in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, those familiar with Su Xuanjun knew that the calmer he looked on the surface, the greater his killing intent!\u201cYou can\u2019t be so extreme. How dazzling is your sister, Wen Lingzhao? Yet in the end, she still had to marry a waste like him, didn\u2019t she?\u201d As he spoke, Huang Qianjun pointed to Su Yi, his gaze rife with disdain. \u201cI might be domineering, but even I know that marriage alliances aren\u2019t up to juniors like us to decide!\u201dHe paused, then laughed, his tone even more arrogant. \u201cWen Lingxue, I urge you to mentally prepare yourself. The Huang Family will convince the Wen Family to agree to our marriage within the month!\u201dWen Lingxue instantly went white, and her petite frame quivered. His words struck her right where it hurt!How strongly had her elder sister fought against her impending marriage? Even her parents had opposed it with all their might, but in the end, they couldn\u2019t go against the family matriarch\u2019s wishes. Wen Lingzhao and Su Yi were now joined in matrimony, whether they liked it or not.In the face of that fact, Wen Lingxue couldn\u2019t help but worry. What if Huang Qianjun really proposed? Would the Wen Family treat her the same way they\u2019d treated her sister?When this thought occurred to her, Wen Lingxue bit through her lip. She was inwardly frantic, and her eyes went blank.\u00a0Am I\u2026. Am I really going to have to marry a dandy hoodlum like him?No! If that happens, I might as well just kill myself!\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Nothing like that will happen to you.\u201d A warm hand pressed against her shoulder, and when she looked up, she saw a calm, gentle smile on Su Yi\u2019s handsome face.\u201cBrother-in-law\u2026.\u201d Wen Lingxue was inwardly panicked, and his words were like shelter from the storm. She felt an indescribable warmth well from deep within her heart, and when she spoke, her words were choked with emotion.\u201cThis gathering is no longer fun,\u201d Su Yi whispered. \u201cHow about I take you home?\u201d\u201cMm!\u201d Wen Lingxue instinctively nodded, but then, her eyes filled with concern. \u201cBrother-in-law\u2026. they\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Su Yi gently. He patted her on the shoulder again. \u201cLeave it up to me.\u201dHis gaze swept across Nie Teng and the girls. \u201cDo you want to leave too?\u201dThe other guests were practically stunned out of their wits.\u00a0Has Su Yi gone insane? Can\u2019t he tell that that silkpants and his guards are blocking the doorway?None of them would have ever guessed that a man who\u2019d lost his entire cultivation, a live-in son-in-law, the butt of Guangling City\u2019s jokes, would dare say something like that!\u201cHah? Did you just say you\u2019re going to lead them out of here?\u201d Huang Qianjun cleaned his ears with an exaggerated grin. \u201cSu Yi, you\u2019re nothing but a cripple, but your words are even more arrogant than mine! Tell me\u2026. Just who gave you the courage?\u201dHis guards were overwrought with laughter, as if they\u2019d heard the funniest thing in the world.\u201cSu Yi, don\u2019t add to our troubles, will you?\u201d Nie Teng was quite annoyed with him, and his expression was ashen. He spoke deliberately, his words pointed. \u201cLeave this to me. You just sit tight and don\u2019t cause trouble! If you make this any worse, don\u2019t blame me for what happens to you!\u201dHis words were sonorant and forceful, and the girls were moved despite themselves. In their eyes, Nie Teng seemed like a forthright gentleman!By comparison, Su Yi\u2019s earlier display was just\u2026. Way too irritating!A mere waste thought that words alone were enough to get them out of here? What a joke!\u201cYou\u2019re young, so you ought to be hotblooded. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be worthy of that youthful head on your shoulders.\u201d Su Yi looked at Nie Teng and nodded. \u201cI approve of your current behavior.\u201dNie Teng was stunned.\u00a0What\u2026? The way he\u2019s talking to me\u2026. It\u2019s like he\u2019s\u2026But before he came to his senses, Huang Qianjun visibly ran out of patience. He waved to his subordinates. \u201cGo on. Seize that worthless wretch, strip him, and hang him from the city gates. I want the whole city to bear witness to his shame!\u201d\u201cJust watch, Young Master!\u201d One of the guards could no longer wait. He charged right towards Su Yi. \u201cKid, I\u2019ll play with you!\u201dThis particular guard was tall, brawny, and full-faced. Just standing there, he gave off an oppressive air. The girls\u2019 faces went white, shocked by his ferocious appearance.Yang Sheng!He was the strongest of Huang Qianjun\u2019s subordinates. He was in the \u201cRefining Muscle\u201d stage of the Blood Circulation Realm. His skin and flesh were like iron, and he was as powerful as a rampaging bull. Furthermore, he was proficient in the \u201cGreat Tablet Smashing Hand\u201d.This technique could easily snap and shatter bone. If it didn\u2019t kill you, it\u2019d still cripple you.As he spoke, he suddenly swung his palm with all his might and full intentions of shattering his target. His attack stirred up fierce winds, and if it landed, it was sure to result in grievous injuries.\u201cBrother-in-law! Hurry up and dodge!\u201d Wen Lingxue cried out in alarm. Her beautiful face lost its color. At this distance, there was no way she could get there in time to stop Yang Sheng\u2019s fist.\u201cDon\u2019t panic. A meathead who trains his body but not his qi is about as threatening as an embroidered pillow.\u201d As Su Yi\u2019s indifferent voice rang out, his gaunt frame took action.He took a step forward, like a hawk setting its sights on a rabbit. His hand formed a claw, and he expertly caught Yang Sheng\u2019s wrist. Strength coursed through his arms.A single quiver of the wrist, and Yang Sheng\u2019s hulking frame staggered. His blood and energy were thrown into turmoil, like scrunched-up, overturned sheets. Just one shake stopped his forceful momentum as if it were a bamboo pole snapping in two.He trembled as if on the verge of collapse.This was a\u00a0nigh-divine application of power!When practiced to the limits of profundity, a single successful strike was enough to \u201cshake\u201d an opponent\u2019s blood, flesh, bones, and organs into powder!Although Yang Sheng wasn\u2019t about to die on the spot, the vibrations had dealt enormous damage to his innards.Immediately afterward, Su Yi threw a kick.Bang!As the onlookers watched in disbelief, Yang Sheng went flying through the air and slammed into the walls of the private dining room.He twitched violently, shaking from head to toe as blood leaked from all seven apertures of his face.Everyone present was shocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Wetting Himself in Terror\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Nie Teng\u2019s mind went blank, and he stood there in a daze.Wen Lingxue and her female classmates\u2019 eyes widened in shock.A year ago, the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, Su Yi, had an accident which turned him into a waste without any cultivation. Everyone in Guangling City knew that.Yet they\u2019d just watched Su Yi deal Yang Sheng heavy injuries in a single attack!\u201cYang Sheng, are you okay?\u201d Huang Qianjun\u2019s expression shifted as well. Yang Sheng was the most capable fighter among his subordinates, a vicious character at the Refining Muscle stage of the Blood Circulation Realm, but Su Yi had left him grieviously wounded in a single blow. Huang Quanjin dared not believe his eyes.\u201cYoung Master\u2026. I\u2026.. Argh!\u201d Yang Sheng lay crumpled in the corner. He tried to struggle to his feet, only to hack up a mouthful of blood. His head lolled to the side, and he passed out.Huang Qianjun\u2019s expression instantly filled with awe-inspiring, violent malice. His fury peaked, and with a sudden sweep of his arm, he roared, \u201cWhat are you just standing there for? Hurry up and kill him!\u201dHis guards looked at each other, then stepped forward and charged.Every one of them was a cultivator, and they were vicious characters who fought and slaughtered on the regular. They were no mere fledgling hoodlums.When all of them charged at once, they were like a swarm of hungry crocodiles!Their ferocious momentum alone left Wen Lingxue, Nie Teng, and the girls watching with bated breath. Their hands and feet went cold, and their minds went blank.Although they\u2019d started cultivating the Martial Dao at a young age, they\u2019d never had to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, and they\u2019d never experienced bloodshed or life and death battles.When had they ever seen anything like this? Their hearts and minds shook, effectively rooting them in place.This didn\u2019t escape Su Yi\u2019s notice.\u00a0Later on, I\u2019ll have to find a chance to train Lingxue. Cultivating the Martial Dao isn\u2019t just a matter of sitting and meditating. Tempering your mind, courage, and bearing is necessary too.Despite his predicament, he was as calm as ever, neither anxious nor flustered. Only when his foes drew near did Su Yi take a step forward. His palm swung out.Whap!It looked like a casual slap, but the guard at the front of the pack felt as if he\u2019d collided with a mountain. The blow sent him flying, destroying an elegant pearwood chair.He didn\u2019t give them any chance to react. Before they knew what was happening, Su Yi advanced. With every step he took, he sent a guard flying.One slammed into the wall, snapping his bones.One collided with the table, leaving him drenched in soup and covered in food.One was slapped so hard, he fell over backward, frothing at the mouth\u2026.By Su Yi\u2019s seventh step, the private dining room was in ruins, and the guards all lay slumped on the ground.All sorts of agonized cries and groans rose into the air.From beginning to end, Su Yi\u2019s movements were simple, casual, understated waves of the hand.\u201cHe\u2026. He\u2026..\u201d The girls stood there, dazed and tongue-tied.The Su Yi they\u2019d disregarded from the start of the banquet, the \u201cwaste\u201d they\u2019d disdained as a mere live-in son-in-law, was strong enough to sweep an entire group of guards?This was so far beyond their expectations that they couldn\u2019t have been any more shocked.Nie Teng was struck dumb, too. His hair stood on end. When he recalled that, just minutes ago, he\u2019d been wondering how best to deliver Su Yi a few good kicks, his heart shook.As the guests watched in utter disbelief, Su Yi strode up to Huang Qianjun. His eyes narrowed, and his lips rose into a faint sneer. \u201cDid you just say you wanted me dead?\u201dThe entire venue fell dead silent!Huang Qianjun\u2019s face alternated white and green. His emotions flitted back and forth, dazed on minute and astonished the next.He was clearly stunned too. He never would have guessed that all of his guards combined would be no match for Su Yi.Su Yi was nothing like the crippled, worthless live-in son-in-law he imagined!Currently, Su Yi was but one step away. When Huang Qianjin looked into those profound, inscrutable eyes, he felt in irrepressible chill run down his spine. Terror washed over him, and he shook violently from head to toe.However, he\u2019d been a domineering, arrogant young master for years, so he steeled himself and said, \u201cSu Yi, even if you were far stronger than this, you\u2019d still just be a low-status, debase, live-in son-in-law, while I\u2019m a disciple in the Huang Family\u2019s direct line of descent!\u201dSaying that out loud boosted his courage, and his tone turned sharp and cold. \u201cAttack if you dare. Go on! But if you do, just wait! The Huang Family will avenge me!\u201dHuang Qianjun had thrown his weight around Guangling City for years. This was fundamentally due to his family background; he was from the Huang Family, and his father was the current family head.This was the source of his domineering pride.As expected, when they heard Huang Qianjun\u2019s threats, Wen Lingxue and Nie Teng\u2019s hearts sank. They\u2019d only just realized how serious the repercussions of this incident would be.However, Su Yi only laughed. \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201dHis hand suddenly shot out, grabbing Huang Qianjun by the throat and lifting him into the air. He whispered, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the guts, keep talking. See for yourself if I dare kill you or not.\u201dThe stranglehold on Huang Qianjun\u2019s neck was agonizing, and his face flushed red and purple. As Su Yi exerted pressure through his fingers, Huang Qianjun could clearly sense himself growing dizzy. His vision was going black. Before long, he\u2019d be on the verge of death.A powerful, instinctive will to live stimulated him, and he struggled madly, but it was useless. From the onlookers\u2019 perspective, he seemed like a captured grasshopper, his life and death up to a moment\u2019s whim!Is Su Yi really going to kill him?\u00a0This thought suddenly occured to Wen Lingxue and the party guests, startling them. Without exception, their expressions changed dramatically.\u201cWell? Why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d Su Yi asked with a smile.Huang Qianjun\u2019s cheeks contorted. He shook and flailed, but he nevertheless clenched his teeth, too scared to speak. His eyes brimmed over with deep terror.In all his years of life, this was the first time he\u2019d felt death so close at hand. He felt as if were on the verge of breaking down.Suddenly, Su Yi\u2019s nostrils flared and his brow furrowed.Thud!He tossed Huang Qianjun away. When he landed, there was a puddle of yellow liquid beneath him.When they saw this, the onlookers were astonished, but they also felt the urge to laugh. Who would have guessed that a domineering, violent young master like Huang Qianjun would lose control of his bladder?\u201cMy friend, please stay your hand!\u201d Suddenly, they heard a voice from outside the private dining room.A man in brocade robes rushed inside, then cupped his fist in greeting. \u201cMy name is Yue Tianhe, and I\u2019m the owner of this humble establishment. Please do me a favor and let Young Master Huang go.\u201dYue Tianhe!Wen Lingxue and Nie Teng\u2019s pupils constricted. They\u2019d all heard tales of the owner of the Immortal Gathering House. He was keen-eyed and profoundly capable. Moreover, his background was mysterious, and all of his guests belonged to the upper echelon of Guangling City.But against all expectations, Su Yi gave Yue Tianhe no face at all!They watched as Su Yi said flatly, \u201cYou were nowhere to be seen when he barged into our room and caused trouble, but now that he\u2019s the one whose life hangs by a thread, you rush inside and ask me to stay my hand. Do you think you\u2019re just that worthy of my respect? Or\u2026. Do you think I\u2019m a pushover?\u201dHis tone were casual, but his attitude was incomparably firm.Yue Tianhe was visibly startled. It had likely never occurred to him that the Wen Family\u2019s live-in son-in-law would refuse to give\u00a0him\u00a0face.His gaze flicked imperceptibly to Huang Qianjun and the others sprawled on the floor. He instantly grew serious. \u201cYoung Lord Su, you\u2019re right to chastise me. I\u2019m to blame for arriving so late. Had I come earlier, this never would have happened. I humbly request your understanding. I\u2019ll be sure to find an opportunity to pay you a visit and apologize.\u201dWith that, he bowed respectfully.Wen Lingxue, Nie Teng, and the others were completely dazed.Someone of Yue Tianhe\u2019s status had no need to be so humble! His meek response left them a bit bewildered.Su Yi shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize. After all, this incident had nothing to do with you. That said, if you\u2019ll forgive me for putting such ugly words out in the open, if you really get involved, you\u2019ll only invite disaster.\u201dYue Tianhe\u2019s pupils instantly constricted, as if seeing Su Yi for the first time. He couldn\u2019t believe the Su Yi before him was the same person as the Wen Family\u2019s live-in son-in-law everyone made fun of.The rumors were wrong!\u00a0Yue Tianhe had seen his fair share of wind and rain, and he made this judgment instantaneously.Meanwhile, Su Yi\u2019s gaze returned to Huang Qianjun. \u201cI, Su Yi, have always made my feelings clear, so I\u2019ll give it to you straight. I\u2019ll give you the chance to get revenge, but if you take it, you\u2019ll have to bear the consequences. Think it over and decide for yourself.\u201dWith that, he turned to the nearby Wen Lingxue, smiled, and waved her over. \u201cLingxue, let\u2019s go.\u201dThe series of shocking events she\u2019d just witnessed left Wen Lingxue in a daze. She instinctively responded, \u201cOkay,\u201d then hurried to Su Yi\u2019s side.Su Yi then turned to Nie Teng and the girls. \u201cEveryone, do you plan to remain here?\u201dThey were still immersed in shocked confusion. They looked at each other, but there was no way they\u2019d stick around! They immediately got up and followed Su Yi out the door.Yue Tinghe made no efforts to stop them. It was only when they disappeared from view that he let out a long sigh. \u201cThe former Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect sure lives up to his reputation. Everyone in Guangling City is underestimating him to an enormous degree\u2026.\u201d\u201cUncle Yue, you\u2019re my father\u2019s old friend. Don\u2019t you see how badly he bullied me? Why didn\u2019t you try to stop him?\u201d Huang Qianjun was already back on his feet. His face was terrifyingly ashen.Fool!\u00a0Yue Tianhe inwardly cursed him, but out loud, he merely grimaced. \u201cMy dear nephew, I dare not bring such trouble upon myself. If you want to resolve this, I suggest you take it up with your father.\u201dIt was just as Su Yi said; getting involved in this was like casting oneself into the flames!\u201cUncle Yue, I never realized you were such a coward. You don\u2019t even dare offend the Wen Family\u2019s live-in son-in-law? Forget everything I said earlier!\u201d With one final remark, Huang Qianjun stormed through the door without so much as stopping to consider his guards.Yue Tianhe made no attempts to keep him. He sneered derisively.\u00a0This silkpants has been spoiled rotten. Without his father\u2019s protection, who knows how many times he\u2019d\u2019ve gotten himself killed by now?Wen Lingxue has the entire Wen Family backing her, while Nie Teng\u2019s father is the captain of the City Lord\u2019s guards. The others are intertwined with various sects and factions too. I\u2019d have to be a real dunderhead to get mixed up in all this!Yue Tianhe\u2019s gaze then swept across the heavily wounded Huang Family guards, doubt rising in his heart.Seth's ThoughtsA quick note about honorifics:At some point I decided to translate \u516c\u5b50 (gongzi) and \u5c11\u7237/\u5c11 (Shaoye/Shao) differently; it just seems appropriate for the genre. Both terms can be reasonably translated as \"young master\", and both can refer to the sons of prominent figures, but \"gongzi\" can also just be a polite way of addressing a young man, while \"shaoye\" has a much stronger sense of \"the young master of a prominent family.\"Huang Qianjun is a \"young master\" through and through, because he's the young master of the Huang Family. Yue Tianhe addresses him accordingly, but he uses the more generically polite \"gongzi\" or \"young lord\" for Su Yi.I'm typing this a few months after I made this decision, so it's possible that this may be applied unevenly in earlier chapters. I'll do my best to prevent confusion, but I apologize in advance for any mistakes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Blocking the Road AheadOutside the Immortal Gathering Place.Wen Lingxue\u2019s friends and classmates hurriedly scampered off, but before they left, most of them couldn\u2019t help but glance at Su Yi.Who would have guessed that in the face of Huang Qianjun\u2019s aggression, the Nie Teng they placed their hopes on could only endure, while the Su Yi they disdained would bring them such a pleasant surprise?After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Nie Teng said \u201cSu Yi, I\u2019ll\u2026. I\u2019ll return this favor!\u201d Then, he turned and left. He\u2019d always loved to show off, but after today\u2019s incident, he was noticeably more reserved.\u201cHe\u2019s not so bad after all.\u201d Su Yi smiled. Gratitude and repaying others\u2019 kindnesses were virtues, after all.\u201cBrother-in-law, just now\u2026.\u201d Wen Lingxue\u2019s lips parted, but she seemed hesitant to continue.\u201cLet\u2019s go home first.\u201d Su Yi smiled and cut her off, then began leading the way.\u201cThat\u2019s fine too.\u201d Wen Lingxue forced down her concerns and hurried after him.As they neared the Wen Family estate, Su Yi pondered briefly, then said in a gentle voice, \u201cLingxue, after today\u2019s incident, there are only two possible outcomes:\u201cOne, that Huang Qianjun guy goes home in search of reinforcements.\u201cTwo, he decides to swallow his rage and remain silent.\u201dWen Lingxue said frantically, \u201cA spoiled silkpants like him? After suffering such a loss, how could he possibly just grin and bear it? He\u2019s sure to come back for revenge!\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right, but even if he does, it\u2019s fine. He\u2019ll only come looking for me.\u201dThis only made Wen Lingxue worry harder. She took a deep breath, then said solemnly, \u201cBrother-in-law, today\u2019s incident happened because of me. There\u2019s no way I'll let any harm come to you!\u201dFierce determination shone on her petite, beautiful face.\u201cRelax,\u201d said Su Yi. He reached out to tousle her hair. \u201cThis incident isn\u2019t as serious as you think.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Wen Lingxue grunted absentmindedly. \u201cBrother-in-law, I\u2026 I\u2019ll head back first.\u201dAs she spoke, she turned and scampered into the Wen Family estate.Su Yi shook his head in mild exasperation. \u201cSilly girl. Even if you ask your parents for help, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d concern themselves with me.\u201dThen, he smiled. He had someone who cared about and worried over him; that was naturally a good thing.For him, today\u2019s incident at the Immortal Gathering House wasn\u2019t the least bit important!\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat? That worthless moocher Su Yi beat Huang Qianjun up?\u201dWhen Wen Lingxue explained everything that had happened, Qin Qing could no longer remain seated. She jumped to her feet in utter astonishment.Wen Changtai almost didn\u2019t dare to believe his ears.Huang Qianjun.He was the heir of the Huang Family Head, Huang Yunchong!\u201cIf Brother-in-law\u00a0weren\u2019t there today, he would have bullied me terribly. He even said he\u2019d show up with a marriage proposal, and that once he brought me home, he\u2019d teach me my place!\u201d Wen Lingxue\u2019s bright eyes were wet with tears as she bitterly vented her grievances. \u201cMom, no matter what, you have to help my Brother-in-law!\u201dQin QIng was seeing red. She gnashed her teeth and spat, \u201cI\u2019ve long since heard stories of that spoiled hoodlum\u2019s poor conduct. They say there\u2019s no depths to which he will not sink, but I never would have guessed he\u2019d try and sink his claws into my daughter!\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Qin Qing trailed off, and her brow furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the ability to resolve this\u2026. It\u2019s all because your father\u2019s useless!\u201dShe turned and glared viciously at Wen Changtai.Wen Changtai grimaced, then muttered, \u201cSu Yi brought this upon himself. What does that have to do with me?\u201d\u201cMom, if you refuse to get involved, I\u2019ll go write Big Sister a letter for help,\u201d said Wen Lingxue frantically. \u201cShe\u2019s a disciple of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy now\u2026.\u201dQin Qing\u2019s eyes lit up, and she slapped her thigh. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Your sister\u2019s status and position are nothing like before!\u201dNow that she had an idea, she rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll go talk to the family head right now. I refuse to believe he\u2019ll ignore our request, if only for Lingzhao\u2019s sake.\u201dWen Lingxue instantly lit up with delight. \u201cHurry, Mom! Hurry!\u201d\u201cSilly girl, I\u2019m doing this for you,\u201d said Qin Qing irritably. \u201cI\u2019m just lending that moocher a hand while I\u2019m at it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing,\u201d said Wen Lingxue, her smile like a flower in bloom.\u2026..The Clan Hall.\u201cSu Yi, that waste\u2026. He actually overpowered Huang Qianjun and his guards?\u201d When he learned why Qin Qing had come, Family Head Wen Changjing found it hard to believe. It didn\u2019t feel real.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Qin Qing froze.\u00a0That\u2019s right. That moocher Su Yi doesn\u2019t have a cultivation anymore!\u201cFamily Head, either way, that Huang Qianjun bullied Lingxue. If he comes back for revenge, we can\u2019t just stand by.\u201d Qin Qing was visibly fraught with worry. \u201cWhen Lingzhao married Su Yi, I already contemplated suicide. If something happens to Lingxue, I\u2026. I really won\u2019t want to live anymore!\u201dQin Qing covered her face and sobbed.Wen Changjing scrunched up his brow, mulled it over, then said, \u201cOf course I\u2019ll step in. After all, Lingxue is a member of the Wen Family. How could we possibly let the Huang Family bully her?\u201dQin Qing instantly lit up with gratitude and delight. \u201cFamily Head, your words have put me at ease!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get excited yet.\u201d Wen Changjing shook his head, his expression cold. \u201cAll I said was that I\u2019ll protect Lingxue. I never said I\u2019d protect Su Yi. No matter his reasons, he caused his mess, and he has to bear the consequences on his own.\u201dQin Qing\u2019s heart sank, and she said tentatively, \u201cFamily Head, if he hadn\u2019t stuck out his neck, Lingxue might have suffered terribly. Do you think\u2014.\u201dWen Changtai coldy cut her off. \u201cSister-in-law, I seem to recall you loathing that son-in-law of yours more than anything else in this world. Why are you suddenly speaking up on his behalf?\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget; just a few days ago, he deeply offended Young Master Wei Zhengyang right in front of everyone. I haven\u2019t even taken him to task over this yet!\u201dAs he spoke that final sentence, his tone was imposing, and his words revealed his anger.Qin Qing froze, embarrassed. Just as she was about to respond, Wen Changjing cut her off again. \u201cThe day after tomorrow is the family matriarch\u2019s eightieth birthday! I have numerous matters to attend to. You go back first!\u201dThat was tantamount to showing her the door. Qin Qing dared not pester him any further, so she hurried off.When she returned to their family\u2019s residence, she saw Wen Lingxue waiting expectantly for her.\u201cMom, how did it go?\u201d The girl stared at her expectantly.Qin Qing forced a smile, then said ambiguously, \u201cThe family head has already agreed to get involved. It\u2019ll be fine. Lingxue, you\u2019re going back to Pinecloud Sword Manor tomorrow. Be good and stay put; there\u2019s absolutely no way that Huang Qianjun will dare cause trouble for you!\u201d\u201cHm! I\u2019m glad to hear it. Brother-in-law won\u2019t get bullied either!\u201d The girl nodded happily and jumped for joy.Qin Qing, however, felt a wave of guilt, and she attempted to comfort herself.\u00a0That Su Yi is ultimately an outsider anyway. Even if the Huang Family teaches him a lesson, it\u2019s no big deal unless they kill him\u2026.She suddenly seemed to recall something. \u201cRight, Lingxue, your brother-in-law\u2026 Did he recover his cultivation?\u201dWen Lingzhao shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. In any event, both Huang Qianjun and his bodyguards were completely helpless against him.\u201dAs she spoke, her eyes lit up, and scenes of Su Yi fighting at the Immortal Gathering House surfaced in her mind. Just thinking about it made her emotional.Qin Qing laughed coldly, as if she\u2019d seen through Su Yi down to the slightest details. \u201cI noticed that kid was hiding something a long time ago. How many rolled eyes and barbed words has he endured over the past year? Yet I\u2019ve never once seen him lose his temper!\u201cLike the night your sister came back. In just a few words, he angered Wei Zhengyang half to death, and he turned the entire situation upside-down! How could a \u2018useless waste\u2019 accomplish something like that?\u201cI\u2019ll have to find a chance to get some answers out of him!\u201dWen Lingxue merely giggled in response, but she kept silent. She thought to herself,\u00a0He\u2019s my brother-in-law! Of course he\u2019s awesome!\u2026..Guangling City, the Huang Family.The atmosphere within their resplendent halls was oppressive.Huang Qianjun knelt on the floor, his voice raspy. \u201cFather, I know I was wrong. I\u2019m willing to admit my mistakes, and going forward, I\u2019ll be sure to cultivate assiduously. Sooner or later, I\u2019ll repay today\u2019s humiliation ten times over\u2014no, one hundred times over!\u201dFamily Head Huang Yunchong sat, silent and expressionless, on the hall\u2019s main seat. He was tall and imposing in his wide-sleeved dark robes, like a crouching tiger or coiled dragon, his presence as vast and mighty as the ocean.The air was so stifled, Huang Qianjun felt as if he could barely breathe.A long time passed before Huang Yunchong suddenly rose to his feet and burst into laughter. \u201cWith such ambition, you\u2019re sure to accomplish something grand one day! Get up. Tomorrow, I'll\u00a0pay that Su\u00a0Yi a visit to discuss this matter. The venue will be the Immortal Gathering House!\u201dHuang Qianjun was dumbfounded. \u201cFather, why pay a personal visit over such a minor matter?\u201dHuang Yunchong walked towards him and helped him to his feet. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. Before you hit a dog, you have to check and see who owns it! I\u2019m Huang Yunchong, and you\u2019re\u00a0my\u00a0son!\u201dHis eyes glinted icy, and his words were cold. \u201cI\u2019ll use him as an example. I want everyone in Guangling City to know that you are Huang Yunchong\u2019s reverse scale, and that if anyone dares touch you, they\u2019ll share the same fate as Su Yi!\u201dHuang Qianjun was both shocked and delighted. \u201cFather, are you\u2026. Are you going to kill him yourself?\u201d\u201cKill him? No, I\u2019ll humiliate him and make him live a life worse than death. You\u2019ll find out tomorrow.\u201d Huang Yunchong\u2019s tone was casual, as if this matter were as trivial as could be.\u2026\u2026A desk stood by a window. Su Yi sat with his back straight. He\u2019d taken up his brush, and was splashing ink across the page. Timelessly graceful and profound characters leaped onto the parchment.Only after night fell did Su Yi set aside his brush. The desk was already piled high with thin sheets of paper, all of them covered in writing.Tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll give this breathing technique to Lingxue,\u00a0Su Yi thought to himself.\u00a0Today was her sixteenth birthday, but due to his oversight, he\u2019d forgotten to buy her a gift. Thus, he\u2019d decided to give her a Martial Dao cultivation technique instead.But to his surprise\u2014When he went looking for her the next morning, the servants told him that she\u2019d already left the Wen Family estate and returned to Pinecloud Sword Manor to continue her studies.Tomorrow is the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s eightieth birthday. Lingxue will definitely be there. There\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t just wait and give this to her then.\u00a0Su Yi shook his head, then left the Wen Family estate.Lately, he\u2019d been going out every morning to cultivate in the \u201cspiritual ground\u201d along the banks of the Great Azure. Today was naturally no exception.\u00a0He continued his cultivation until noon, then headed back towards the city and the Wen Family estate.Tomorrow morning, I have to go treat Xiao Tianque\u2019s injuries. That\u2019ll be one less thing I have to do\u2026. Su Yi thought as he walked, but suddenly, he froze mid-step.\u00a0Hm?He seemed to have sensed something, and he gazed toward a spot not far away.\u201cYoung Lord Su, our master extends his invitations!\u201d A tall elder in black robes stood a bit further down the street, leading an entire group of people. They\u2019d completely blocked off the path ahead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - Apologies\u201cAre you from the Huang Family?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s brow furrowed slightly, but he didn\u2019t seem surprised or flustered.The black-robed elder responded expressionlessly, \u201cYoung Lord Su, you\u2019ve already figured it out, so you\u2019d best come with us quietly. That\u2019ll do us all good.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d asked Su Yi.\u201cThe Immortal Gathering House,\u201d said the elder firmly.Despite himself, Su Yi was stunned.\u00a0Does Huang Qianjun want to crawl back up from the same place he fell?\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He turned and started walking towards the Immortal Gathering House.The black-robed elder and his subordinates were stunned; they would never have guessed Su Yi would be so self-aware and so proactive. Wasn\u2019t this a bit\u00a0too\u00a0simple?\u201cKeep a close eye on him. Whatever you do, don\u2019t let that kid sneak off!\u201d The elder quietly gave his orders, then led his subordinates forward.However, his worries didn\u2019t come to pass. As he walked, Su Yi seemed leisurely and relaxed. He had no intention of fleeing whatsoever.It was only after reaching the Immortal Gathering House and watching Su Yi go inside that the elder sighed in relief. Still, he was surprised.\u00a0The Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law sure has guts!It was just after noon, the time when the Immortal Gathering House\u2019s business was typically at its best. However, when Su Yi entered, he found the place still and lifeless. All the seats were empty.Except, a familiar face stood behind the counter\u2014The owner of the Immortal Gathering House, Yue Tianhe!When he saw Su Yi, Yue Tianhe laughed cheerfully, but it sounded a bit like he was gloating over Su Yi\u2019s misfortune, as if he knew what was about to happen. \u201cYoung Lord Su, Family Head Huang has personally arranged a banquet in the private dining room you visited yesterday. He\u2019s waiting for you as we speak.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid we\u2019ll ruin your Immortal Gathering House?\u201d asked Su Yi casually.Yue Tianhe\u2019s smile froze, but then, he laughed. \u201cYoung Lord Su, please relax. Our signboard is exceptionally durable. There\u2019s no way any ordinary person could damage it.\u201dHe paused, and when he continued, his voice carried a hint of pity. \u201cYou should worry about yourself, Young Lord Su\u2026. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in for bad luck today.\u201dSu Yi smiled. \u201cShopkeeper Yue, you\u2019re welcome to watch the spectacle, but if your Immortal Gathering House suffers any damages,\u00a0I\u2019m sure not\u00a0going to reimburse you.\u201dAs he gave this warning, he was already heading up the stairs to the second floor.Yue Tianhe scrunched up his brow.\u00a0Why does that brat look so fearless? Does he have something up his sleeves?But the one who\u2019s out to get him today is Huang Yunchong! The head of the Huang Family, one of the most influential and powerful figures in all of Guangling City!Su Yi, I\u2019d like to see just how a mere live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family like you plans to leave the Immortal Gathering House in one piece!Meanwhile, the door to the second-floor private dining room was already open. When Su Yi arrived, he saw three people seated inside.The first was Huang Qianjun. His robes were dark and lavish, and he sat beside a middle-aged man in dragon-embroidered imperial robes.The man was tall and imposing, with features as hard as rocks. Although he was seated casually, his presence was imposing as a coiling dragon or tiger lying in wait.A green-robed man with a long knife strapped to his waist sat on his other side. He looked roughly forty years old, and his complexion was sallow. He was busy fiddling with a silver dagger.As he shifted his hands, the sharp, cold dagger jumped and rolled about so rapidly, it left onlookers dazzled.When Su Yi appeared, the man in green narrowed his eyes and looked him up and down. Moments later, he burst into jeering laughter. It seemed he was disappointed.\u201cSu Yi, you\u2019re finally here!\u201d Huang Qianjun\u2019s eyes blazed with hatred carved into his very bones.\u201cYesterday, I told you I\u2019d give you your chance to get revenge,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cSince you\u2019ve decided to take it, it\u2019s only natural I\u2019d show up.\u201dAs Su Yi spoke, he leisurely strolled into the room, picked a seat at random, and sat down. His gaze swept across the middle-aged men in green and imperial robes, but he said no more.The man in embroidered dragon robes seemed surprised, perhaps because Su YI seemed overly composed.Then, he suddenly lamented, \u201cThe former Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect is indeed far braver than the common man. I can finally confirm that Yue Tianhe was right, the old fox. The people of Guangling City have indeed underestimated you.\u201dHe might have sounded mellow, but he emanated the imposing air of an authority figure.Su Yi stretched out his hand and tapped casually on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s already noon. If you want to make small talk, I\u2019m going to go ahead and order food and drinks. We can chat over lunch.\u201dHuang Qianjun scowled.\u00a0Does he really think we\u2019re here to eat?The man in green\u2019s expression remained unchanged. He just went on fiddling with his silver dagger, as if he weren\u2019t the least bit interested in any of this.The man in imperial dragon robes laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019ve still got an appetite after this is over, I guarantee I\u2019ll let you eat your fill.\u201dAfter a brief pause, he introduced himself. \u201cMy name is Huang Yunchong. I heard you taught my good-for-nothing son a lesson here yesterday. Let\u2019s set aside who was right and who was wrong. My son was bullied. As his father, I have to do something about it, don\u2019t you think?\u201dSu Yi gave an easy nod. \u201cHit the little one, and the big one comes running. It\u2019s to be expected.\u201dHuang Yunchong tilted forward, his eyes instantly incomparably sharp. He stared straight ahead at Su Yi and said, \u201cI can see that you\u2019re a clever sort, so I\u2019ll be direct. If we don\u2019t resolve this incident, what happened yesterday will make my son the laughingstock of Guangling City. He\u2019s almost a grown man, yet he peed his pants in fright? If word of this spreads, well, it won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s face contorted in fury and embarrassment, and when he next looked at Su Yi, his gaze was even more vicious.\u201cHow do you propose we resolve this?\u201d asked Su Yi, entirely unruffled.Huang Yunchong\u2019s presence was powerful and imposing; he was obviously an imposing expert of the Qi Accumulation Realm. His every movement struck terror into people\u2019s hearts.But this little bit of presence was nowhere near enough to influence Su Yi\u2019s mind. On the contrary, he felt the urge to laugh.Trying to intimidate people?You have to determine who you\u2019re dealing with first!Su Yi\u2019s indifference response surprised Huang Yunchong once more. He pondered for a moment, then smiled faintly. \u201cWith an apology.\u201d\u201cAn apology?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Get down on your knees, then crawl all the way out of the Immortal Gathering House, kowtowing once with each step.\u201d Huang Yunchong casually pointed to the floor outside the private dining room. His voice was gentle, and he wore a smile on his face. \u201cYou have to make noise when your head hits the ground. It has to be audible from every private room on all three floors of the Immortal Gathering House.\u201dHuang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but smile, straight from the heart. His eyes lit up with excitement.The man in green spoke up for the first time. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh, \u201cFamily Head, you sure are merciful.\u201dHuang Yunzhong\u2019s\u00a0grin\u00a0broadened. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. This is just a conflict between youths; there\u2019s no need to be ruthless.\u201dYou think that\u2019s not ruthless?\u00a0Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but gasp. His father\u2019s casual, understated tone shocked even him.Huang Yunchong\u2019s gaze was fixed on Su Yi the entire time. He continued, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve kowtowed your way out of the building, you are to kneel there and slap yourself. Remember, you need to use enough force to make noise. It needs to be clearly audible even from thirty feet away.\u201dAs he said this, his fingers drummed against the tabletop, and he flashed a carefree smile. \u201cOnce the onlookers disperse, that\u2019ll be the end of this incident. \u201cHuang Qianjun\u2019s heart filled with excitement, eager to see what was about to happen.\u201cThe way I see it, this punishment is still too light. That said, since the head of the family doesn\u2019t want to make a big fuss, we can just leave it at that. We\u2019ll let the kid off easy.\u201d The man in green toyed with his dagger, and his narrow eyes bore into Su Yi like a knife. \u201cWill you do it yourself, or do you need me to help you?\u201dHis voice was raspy, like a poisonous snake flicking its tongue. The sound sent chills down listeners\u2019 spines.Huang Yunchong and Huang Qianjun looked at Su Yi as well. The entire private dining room\u2019s atmosphere was suddenly tense and heavy.But in the end, Su Yi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t so much as ripple. He said coldly, \u201cAnd here I thought you were daring enough to kill. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that\u2026. You\u2019d come up with a silly little game like this.\u201dHuang Qianjun was stunned. He almost didn\u2019t believe his ears.Huang Yunchong furrowed his brow.The green-robed man\u2019s eyes frosted over. He shot to his feet, emanating a terrifying aura. It seemed he was about to attack.But it was then that\u2014The heavy thudding of frantic footsteps rang out, immediately followed by a\u00a0coarse\u00a0voice\u201cBrother Huang, please give me face and let Su Yi go.\u201dThis voice was still echoing as a large, powerful, imposing man with a curled beard strode into the private room, his bright eyes flashing like lightning.\u201cNie Beihu?\u201d Huang Yunchong\u2019s brow furrowed even deeper, and he snorted coldly, \u201cI simply can\u2019t fathom why the commander of the City Lord\u2019s guards would come here to help a live-in son-in-law.\u201dAh, so he\u2019s Nie Teng\u2019s father\u2026.!\u00a0Su Yi suddenly understood. He recalled what Nie Teng had said yesterday after departing the Immortal Gathering House: \u201cI\u2019ll return this favor!\u201dClearly, after returning home, Nie Teng had requested his father\u2019s assistance.This was most likely why Nie Beihu had shown up here now.As expected, Nie Beihu entered the private dining room and said solemnly, \u201cYesterday, your honorable son bullied my boy. Fortunately, Su Yi stepped in. How could I, Nie Beihu, fail to return this favor?\u201dHuang Yunchong glanced at Huang Qianjun, who hurriedly explained, \u201cFather, I just scared Nie Teng a little, but I didn\u2019t hit him, much less humiliate him.\u201d\u201cBrother Nie, you heard him. This matter has nothing to do with your son,\u201d said Huang Yunchong. His expression was cold, his words indifferent. \u201cOn the contrary, my son was the one who got bullied. If I simply let this go, how can my son live in Guangling City with his head held high?\u201dNie Beihu\u2019s expression darkened, but just as he was about to say something, Huang Yunchong cut him off. \u201cBrother Nie, there\u2019s no need to say anymore. Never mind you, even if Family Head Wen Changjing were here in person, he couldn\u2019t protect Su Yi!\u201dHis words were sonorant, forceful, and lofty.Nie Beihu\u2019s expression instantly turned unsightly. He\u2019d come in person, only to be refused so bluntly; it was like a slap in the face.When Su Yi saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but inwardly shake his head. He\u2019d never planned on relying on other people to resolve this anyway.However, whatever else he might say, Nie Beihu had come here to help him. He couldn\u2019t just watch him get treated like this.But before Su Yi could respond, they heard yet another series of hurried footsteps emanate from beyond the stairway.Huang Yunhong\u2019s brows knit in displeasure.The Immortal Gathering House was Yue Tianhe\u2019s territory. He\u2019d assumed that no one would disturb him here, yet now it had happened again! Of course Huang Yunchong was annoyed!The others in the room were confused.\u00a0Who is it this time?Before long, someone new appeared outside the private room.It was a middle-aged man in loose-sleeved Confucian robes. He had a long, willowy beard and mustache and an exceptional bearing. However, his brow was knit with burning panic, and his forehead was covered in a sheen of sweat. It was obvious he\u2019d come here in a hurry.When he arrived and saw that Su Yi was sitting there unharmed, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh in relief.Then, beneath the group\u2019s stunned gaze, the middle-aged man in Confucian robes rushed up to Su Yi and bowed in greeting. \u201cYoung Lord Su, they didn\u2019t hurt you, did they?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - A Bloodied ForeheadSu Yu thought the\u00a0man vaguely\u00a0familiar, but he couldn\u2019t remember where he\u2019d seen him before. He suppressed his confusion and asked, \u201cDo I look injured?\u201dWhen the man in Confucian robes saw this, he finally relaxed. He said hurriedly, \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alright. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alright.\u201dHowever, when he turned to look at the others present, his easy-going, elegant expression turned cold and severe. \u201cHuang Yunchong, you\u2019ve sure got gall!\u201dHis voice boomed like a sudden crack of thunder, striking terror into their hearts.Huang Yunchong\u2019s expression changed dramatically the moment he saw the man in Confucian robes enter the room. Hearing this rebuke, he froze in place.Then, he could no longer remain seated. He rose and asked in bewilderment, \u201cBrother Fu, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cCity\u2026. City Lord?\u201d Huang Qianjun was stunned, and he shot to his feet, looking dazed.\u00a0Since when does Su Yi have a connection to the City Lord?The man in green seemed frantic too. He immediately put away his dagger, lowered his head, and clasped his fist. \u201cGreetings, City Lord Fu!\u201dNie Beihu hurriedly greeted him as well. \u201cYour humble subordinate greets you, Your Excellency!\u201dThe elegant City Lord was immediately the center of attention.Fu Shan!The lord of Guangling City, a grand martial artist of the Qi Accumulation Stage. He held enormous power, his prestige lofty as the heavens!So it\u2019s him!\u00a0Su Yi finally understood, only for a new thread of confusion to rise within his heart.\u00a0I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any link between us at all, though?Suddenly, another possibility occurred to him.\u00a0Could it be that\u2026..In the end, he said nothing. He just sat back and watched in cold silence.\u201cHuang Yunchong, if I hadn\u2019t come, how could I have witnessed this display of your power?\u201d Fu Shan\u2019s gaze was icy, as imposing as an infuriated sovereign.The veins\u00a0bulged\u00a0on Huang Yunchong\u2019s forehead, and he forced himself to remain calm. He could get away with disrespecting Nie Beihu, but he had no choice but to fear Fu Shan, the lord of the city.\u201cBrother Fu, I\u00a0investigated this Su\u00a0Yi\u2019s background. Even at his strongest, he was just the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect.\u201cAnd today, he\u2019s nothing but the disregarded live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family. He\u2019s insignificant\u2026.\u201d Huang Yunchong said as if thinking out loud. \u201cBrother Fu, I truly don\u2019t understand why someone as lofty as you would go out of your way to help him.\u201dHuang Qianjun, the man in green, and Nie Beihu were all wondering the exact same thing.\u201cInsignificant?\u201d Fu Shan\u2019s eyes filled with mockery, but he remained otherwise expressionless. \u201cIn light of our prior acquaintanceship, I don\u2019t mind telling you that before I came to the Immortal Gathering House, the Young Marchioness of Spiritjade Prefecture said that if Su Yi lost so much as a single hair on his head, she\u2019d have me offer my head in penance!\u201dHis words went off like a thunderclap!Every last one of them reacted visibly, rooted to the spot.\u201cAre you saying he\u2019s\u2026. Friends with the Young Marchioness of Spiritjade Prefecture?\u201d Huang Yunchong turned to look at Su Yi in utter disbelief.The Young Marchioness of Spiritjade PrefectureShe was a true-blue relative of the imperial family, and although she was born into Lanling\u2019s Xiao Family, the current emperor of the Great Zhou had granted her the title of \u2018marchioness\u2019 personally!Her status was terrifyingly lofty!But Su Yi was just the low-status live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family. When had he become friends with the Young Marchioness of Spiritjade Prefecture?Nie Beihu and that green-robed man reacted as if they\u2019d seen a ghost.With their status, they were well aware of the implications of Fu Shan\u2019s words. In the Young Spiritjade Marchioness\u2019 heart, Fu Shan\u2019s life was nowhere near as valuable as Su Yi\u2019s!\u201cHuang Yunchong, oh, Huang Yunchong. Your actions almost cost me my head!\u201d Fu Shan said coldly.\u201cI\u2026..\u201d Huang Yunchong could no longer remain calm, and he broke out into cold sweats. Even though he was the head of the Huang Family, capable of commanding both wind and rain in Guangling City, he still had to treat Fu Shan with respect.As for the Young Spiritjade Marchioness, her status was so lofty that the entire Huang Family put together still couldn\u2019t risk offending her!\u201cFather, who is this \u2018young marchioness\u2019 of Spiritjade Prefecture? Is\u2026. Is she more amazing than my uncle?\u201d Huang Qianjun asked nervously. He\u2019d realized that something wasn\u2019t right, but he was too young to understand the implications.Whack!As soon as the words left his lips, Huang Qianjun felt someone slap him across the face. He thudded to the ground, his cheeks red, swollen, and bleeding.He\u2019d been slapped silly. Why? Because his father was the one who\u2019d hit him!\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Huang Yunchong\u2019s face was ashen, and his eyes were ablaze with fury. His terrifying expression made a chill wash over Huang Qianjun, who quivered from head to toe.\u201cIf your uncle found out about this, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019d divorce your aunt on the spot, kick her out, and draw an irrevocable line between himself and the Huang Family!\u201d Fu Shan laughed coldly.Huang\u00a0Qianjun\u2019s\u00a0aunt, that is, Huang Yunchong\u2019s little sister, was the favored concubine of Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s prefectural governor, Qin Wenyuan.Qin Wenyuan was a lofty figure who stood above the nineteen city lords of Cloudriver Prefecture!Due to the Huang Family\u2019s connection with him, in the past, Fu Shan wouldn\u2019t have dared provoke the Huang Family lightly.But now, everything\u00a0was\u00a0different!Huang Qianjun finally realized the severity of the problem, and he sat there, frozen and dazed, as if he\u2019d lost his soul. He wanted to stand, but it was as if he'd lost all his strength. No matter how hard he tried, his legs wouldn\u2019t support him.But at a time like this, how could Huang Yunchong find the time to concern himself with his son?He took a deep breath, then suddenly faced Su Yi and bowed at the waist. Voice bitter, he said, \u201cI had eyes, but I could not see. I didn\u2019t know Young Lord Su was friends with the Young Spiritjade Marchioness. I was mistaken, and I humbly request your forgiveness!\u201dThe private dining room fell into utter silence. Everyone\u2019s hearts churned.Huang Yunchong was the head of the Huang Family, a towering figure within Guangling City. He even dared to blatantly disrespect Nie Beihu, the captain of the Old Guard.Even when he faced City Lord Fu Shan, he was merely cautious.Yet now, because of the \u201cSpiritjade Marchioness\u201d, he was bowing and lowering his head to Su Yi!\u201cFather\u2026.\u201d Huang Qianjun was rooted to the spot, intense feelings of helplessness coursing through him. In his heart, his father was like a mountain, capable of covering the heavens with a single hand.When he saw his father bow to a mere live-in son-in-law like Su Yi, it was as if\u2026 the towering mountain in his heart crumbled!The man in green\u2019s body went taut, his expression gloomy and uncertain.When he saw this play out, Nie Beihu inwardly mocked himself,\u00a0Look\u00a0at this situation! Did Su Yi really need help from someone like me?Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows merely lifted slightly.Family Head Huang had been brazenly arrogant mere moments ago, yet now he was lowering his head and quivering in trepidation. Su Yi naturally understood that Huang Yunchong wasn\u2019t really bowing to him, but rather to the \u201cSpiritjade Marchioness\u201d!\u201cYoung Lord Su, how do you propose we settle this matter?\u201d Fu Shan turned and asked lightly. Facing Su Yi, the lord of Guangling City maintained a respectful bearing. He dared not show the slightest negligence.Su Yi\u2019s gaze flicked toward Huang Qianjun. \u201cDo you remember what I said to you yesterday?\u201dHuang Qianjun started. Then, the blood drained from his face, and his lips quivered. \u201cI\u2026.\u201dBefore he could continue, Su Yi beat him to the punch. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll give you the chance to get revenge, but if you take it, you\u2019ll have to bear the consequences.\u2019\u201dHuang Qianjun naturally remembered, but yesterday, he hadn\u2019t cared in the least.Hearing it now, however, every word cut into him like a bone-chilling knife to the heart.His terror and panic peaked. He couldn\u2019t help but glance at his father, Huang Yunchong.Huang Yunchong, however, maintained his respectful bow. Despite himself, he was frantic. He grit his teeth and said, \u201cYoung Lord Su, I\u2019m willing to single-handedly bear the consequences of this incident!\u201dSu Yi shook his head. He glanced at Fu Shan and said, \u201cI can tell that the reason City Lord Fu Shan said all that was to warn you and your son of the potential harm and prevent you from crossing any lines and inviting even greater disaster.Fu Shan\u2019s expression froze. He really had brought up the \u201cSpiritjade Marchioness\u201d for that exact purpose! After all, Huang Yunchong was the head of the Huang Family. If they pursued this matter to the bitter end, as the city lord, Fu Shan would suffer its impact too.But Fu Shan wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Su Yi would see through him at a glance!After calming himself back down, Fu Shan solemnly clasped his fist. \u201cYoung Lord Su, your eyes are bright as torches. As expected, I cannot hide my intentions from you. However, I guarantee that you may resolve this matter however you see fit. I won\u2019t object, no matter what you decide!\u201dHearing the city lord\u2019s solemn vow, all three members of the Huang Family\u2019s expressions changed, and their hearts sank.Su Yi\u2019s expression was calm as ever. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked relying on others\u2019 power. Besides, City Lord Fu, you came here to help me; I naturally won\u2019t make things hard on you.\u201dFu Shan inwardly sighed in relief.However, he then watched as Su Yi fixed his gaze on the man in green. \u201cYou like playing with that dagger, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Su Yi with a faint smile. \u201cTake it back out and cut off your own hand.\u201dThe man in green had been fiddling with his dagger from the moment Su Yi entered the private dining room. His words were enigmatic and his movements flippant, but if not for Nie Beihu\u2019s sudden arrival, he would have attacked Su Yi.Su Yi naturally wouldn\u2019t overlook him.The crowd\u2019s hearts went cold.The man in green was called Huang Yin, and he was the captain of the Huang Family\u2019s guards. He was a peak Blood Circulation Realm expert, and within Guangling City, he was a top-tier martial artist.If he lost a hand, it would inevitably have an enormous impact on his cultivation of the Martial Dao!\u201cI\u2026. Might I atone in some other way?\u201d Huang Yin\u2019s expression changed dramatically. He was incomparably nervous.Su Yi said nothing. He just smiled faintly at him.Fu Shang gazed coldly at Huang Yunchong.This formless pressure bore down on Huang Yunchong\u2019s chest. Finally, his expression contorted, and he said, \u201cHuang Yin, do it!\u201dThe blood drained from Huang Yin\u2019s eyes, and his eyes went slack and lifeless. Trembling, he retrieved his concealed dagger, pointed its edge at his right hand, and slashed.Splurt!A still-bleeding right hand fell to the floor. Blood poured down like a waterfall.Huang Yin\u2019s cheeks twitched with agony, and he was covered in sweat.Only then did Su Yi nod and avert his gaze. This time, he looked at Huang Yunchong. \u201cJust now, didn\u2019t you say that you wanted me to get down on my knees and crawl out of the Immortal Gathering House, kowtowing with every step? How do you think we should resolve this?\u201dHuang Yunchong\u2019s\u00a0pupils violently\u00a0constricted. Huang Qianjun, meanwhile, was ashen with fright.Fu Shan and Nie Beihu glanced at each other. They couldn\u2019t help but pity this father-son duo. This was what people meant when they referred to \u201cpicking up a stone only to drop it on your own toes!\u201dIf Huang Yunchong crawled and kowtowed his way out of the building\u2026. It would leave his reputation in tatters. He could forget about ever raising his head in public again!\u201cFather, I\u2019ll\u00a0kowtow! I\u2019ll\u00a0kowtow!\u201d Suddenly, Huang Qianjun sobbed, threw himself onto the ground, and slammed his head into the floor.Wham!The wood below shook. The sound of kowtowing was like the beat of a drum.Soon, the skin broke, bloodying Huang Qianjun\u2019s forehead!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - I Dislike Abusing My PositionChapter 15 - I Dislike Abusing My PositionBang! Bang! Bang!The heavy, forceful sound of kowtowing echoed repeatedly throughout the private dining room.Fu Shan and Nie Beihu were experts long accustomed to bloodshed, but seeing this, they couldn\u2019t help but shudder.Huang Yunchong\u2019s\u00a0brow\u00a0knit with flashes of agony. Hidden within his sleeves, his hands clenched, the nails digging into his flesh.How could any father bear watching his son forced to kowtow repeatedly? How could he not feel hatred? How could his heart not ache?But he could only endure!Today, he\u2019d have no opportunity to lose his temper or get revenge. If he tried, he\u2019d only bring unforeseeable disaster onto the entire Huang Family!\u201cLet\u2019s end this here.\u201d Shortly after, Su Yi suddenly spoke up. He sounded somewhat dispirited.Yesterday, he predicted that Huang Qianjun would come back for revenge, but he would never have guessed that in the end, he\u2019d just sit there doing nothing while others resolved his problems for him.This meant that Su Yi had no sense of accomplishment to speak of.Fu Shan sighed in relief, and his taut nerves finally relaxed. He\u2019d been worried that Huang Yunchong would lose control of his emotions and act up.Fortunately, his concerns didn\u2019t become a reality.\u201cThank you\u2026. Young Lord Su, for your mercy!\u201d Huang Yunchong bowed, head held low. His voice was hoarse.\u201cI said it earlier: I don\u2019t like others fighting my battles for me. That said\u2026. You ought to consider yourselves fortunate. You got lucky today.\u201d Su Yu shot Huang Yunchong a deep look. Then, he got up and stepped through the door.Had he taken action personally, heads would have rolled!Unfortunately, Huang Yunchong and the others most likely hadn\u2019t realized this. Otherwise, they\u2019d be celebrating the fact that they were still alive.\u201cOl\u2019 Huang, I advise you to give up on any thoughts of revenge. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll risk the lives of the entire Huang Family!\u201d As he watched Su Yi\u2019s departure, Fu Shan gave Huang Yunchong a cold warning before hurrying after Su Yi.\u201cChoose your next steps carefully.\u201d Nie Beihu had no interest in sticking around to watch the show, so he followed the city lord out the door.Soon, only Huang Yunchong, Huang Qianjun, and Huang Yi remained.Huang Yunchong tottered, as if he\u2019d lost all the power in his body, and slumped into his chair. His eyes were lifeless, and in an instant, he seemed to grow much older.\u201cFather\u2026..\u201d Huang Qianjun wailed and clutched his bloodied forehead. His face was smeared with blood and tears, making him look strange, bloody, and altogether horrifying.Meanwhile, Huang Yin clutched the stump of his severed hand. His face was pale and translucent from blood loss.\u201cOne wrong step, and we almost caused a lifetime of regret\u2026..\u201d A long time passed before Huang Yunchong returned to his senses. His voice was raspy as he said, \u201cChild, remember this: before becoming a Grandmaster and a member of the nobility, you must not\u2026 you must not seek revenge\u2026.\u201dBy the time he finished giving this command, his voice carried dense exhaustion and bitterness.\u201cFamily Head, are you really just going to let this go?\u201d Huang Yin\u2019s eyes were full of unwillingness.Huang Yunchong suddenly straightened his back, and his expression was chillingly cold. \u201cIf you dare cause trouble,\u201d he said, pausing for emphasis between each word, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for killing a relative in the name of the greater good!\u201dHuang Yin froze, then sank into silence.At that moment, Huang Qianjun, the young silkpants, finally understood the cruelty of reality.Sometimes, even their Huang Family had no choice but to endure their anger in silence!And all of this was because of the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law\u2026.When he recalled this, Huang Qianjun felt bewilderment wash over him. Su Yi was the live-in son-in-law everyone in Guangling City mocked, the cripple who\u2019d lost his entire cultivation.\u00a0How could he possibly have such a terrifying position?The first floor of the Immortal Gathering House.As soon as Su Yi appeared in the stairwell, he saw a middle-aged man in brocade robes waiting for him. The man lowered his head and bent at the waist, a toadyish smile on his face. \u201cI just knew you\u2019d avert disaster and return safely, Young Lord Su!\u201dThis was none other than the owner of the Immortal Gathering House, Yue Tianhe, an esteemed and powerful figure within Guangling City.When Su Yi first arrived, Yue Tianhe had gloated over his imminent misfortune, eager to watch the spectacle. Yet now, he was nothing but warm smiles.\u201cThe Immortal Gathering House\u2019s signboard really is hard as can be. It actually didn\u2019t suffer much damage at all.\u201d Su Yi jeered coldly.Yue Tianhe smiled awkwardly, but he was thick-skinned. He said abashedly, \u201cYoung Lord Su, your exaggeration puts me to shame. As an expression of my remorse, I welcome you to dine at our establishment free of charge from now on!\u201dSu Yi responded with a simple \u201cOh\u201d, but he said no more. He just walked out of the building.City Lord Fu Shan and Nie Beihu hurried after him.\u201cCity Lord Fu, Commander Nie.\u201d Yue Tianhe hurriedly bowed in greeting.\u201cConsider yourself lucky that nothing untoward happened to Young Lord Su. Or else, I\u2019d have torn down the entire Immortal Gathering House!\u201d Fu Shan snorted coldly, then turned and left without a second look.It was only after Su Yi, Fu Shan, and Nie Beihu disappeared from beyond the gates that Yue Tianhe straightened his back and wiped the cold sweat from his brow.Even now, his heat pounded with lingering terror, and struggled to calm down.Had I known that Su Yi was so capable, I wouldn\u2019t have been so negligent\u2026.\u00a0Yue Tianhe thought to himself.But he suddenly felt rather confused.\u00a0How could a waste like Su Yi get involved with Fu Shan and Nie Beihu?This completely overturned his imagination!\u2026..Outside the Immortal Gathering House.\u201cCommander Fu, Young Lord Su, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be on my way,\u201d said Nie Beihu in a low voice.Fu Shan nodded, then commanded, \u201cDo not spread word of today\u2019s incident.\u201dJust as Nie Beihu turned to leave, Su Yi seemed to recall something. He said suddenly, \u201cCommander Nie, you\u2019ve got yourself a good son.\u201dNie Beihu paused midstep. Then, he continued without a second look, but there was a hint of a smile in his eyes.In this father\u2019s heart, his son, Nie Teng, had a strong sense of gratitude and knew how to repay a kind turn. He was naturally pleased with him!Guangling City is completely mistaken about Su Yi. Who would have guessed he was friends with the Spiritjade Marchioness?Fortunately, Nie\u2019er has already made a good impression on him. Perhaps, in the future, we can build an even firmer relationship\u2026..Nie Beihu was already starting to consider the possibilities.\u201cBy now, I imagine you\u2019ve guessed who the Spiritjade Marchioness is?\u201d asked Fu Shan, his smile amiable and his words polite.Su Yi nodded. \u201cI just didn\u2019t anticipate that she\u2019d arrange for people to tail me. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid you couldn\u2019t possibly have made it to the Immortal Gathering House so quickly.\u201dFu Shan\u2019s smile froze, and he hurriedly explained, \u201cYoung Lord Su, Please don\u2019t misunderstand. The Young Marchioness\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou needn\u2019t explain, City Lord Fu. Regardless, you did me a good turn today, and I\u2019ve never liked owing others\u2019 favors. If you ever run into a problem you can\u2019t resolve, pay me a visit.\u201d With that, Su Yi turned and left.A figure clad in blue disappeared into the flow of pedestrian traffic, solitary and detached from mortal affairs.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Su Yi has quite a few secrets\u2026.\u201d Only after Su Yi disappeared did Fu Shan retract his gaze. He, too, had many doubts, but he was keenly aware that he couldn\u2019t recklessly investigate.What mattered now was reporting back to the Spiritjade Marchioness.\u2026..The City Lord\u2019s estate, a detached residence.Beneath the lush foliage of a parasol tree, Zi Jin listened quietly to Fu Shan\u2019s report.She had a pair of long, smooth jade legs, which offset her tall and slender figure. Her dark hair was up in a casual bun, fully displaying her peerlessly beautiful, egg-shaped face, thin and curved eyebrows, full red lips, and eyes bright as limpid pools. Although she\u2019d intentionally put on a loose-sleeved, plain white dress, it wasn\u2019t enough to disguise her noble air.After hearing Fu Shan\u2019s full account, her star-like eyes were thoughtful. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that Master Su went there on his own, and that he seemed calm and composed the entire time?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Oh, yes, just before he left, he said something strange,\u201d pondered Fu Shan.\u201cLet\u2019s hear it,\u201d said Zi Jin with great interest.\u201cHe said he\u2019s never liked relying on others\u2019 power, and that Huang Yunchong and the others got lucky today.\u201d\u201cLucky\u2026?\u201d Zi Jin\u2019s eyes flashed with unusual light. \u201cIt seems that even if you hadn\u2019t gone to his aid, Master Su already had plans for how to handle this. He\u2019s guessed who I am by now, right?Fu Shan nodded.\u201cHow did he react?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d Fu Shan hesitated, but in the end, he said, \u201cMarchioness, he already guessed that I had my people observing him in secret over the past few days.\u201dZi Jin\u2019s heart clenched. \u201cIs he angry?\u201dFu Shan hurriedly shook his head. \u201cActually, no. He just said that I\u2019d done him a favor, and that if I ran into any thorny problems down the line, I could go to him for aid.\u201dZi Jin nodded. \u201cUncle Fu, you can leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Fu Shan turned and left, while Zi Jin entered one of the stand-alone residence\u2019s other rooms.Inside, she saw Xiao Tianque\u2019s gaunt figure brewing tea. He seemed leisurely, and his complexion was far rosier than before.When he saw Zi Jin enter, he said casually, \u201cI already heard your conversation now. All I can say is, in sending Fu Shan to the Immortal Gathering House, we inadvertently helped Huang Yunchong. Otherwise, with Master Su\u2019s abilities, I\u2019m afraid the Huangs wouldn\u2019t have left the restaurant alive.\u201dZi Jin seemed to want to say something, but she hesitated.\u201cIf you want to say something, just say it. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone else here.\u201d Xiao Tianque smiled and shook his head.Zi Jin took a deep breath, then said seriously, \u201cGrandpa, the results of our investigations prove that Su Yi\u2026. Master Su isn\u2019t some otherworldly expert or lofty, inscrutable immortal. He\u2019s just the Wen Family\u2019s live-in son-in-law. Why do you still value him so highly?\u201dXiao Tianque smiled, then sighed, \u201cOnce you reach my age, you\u2019ll discover that so-called \u2018status\u2019, \u2018position\u2019, and \u2018authority\u2019 aren\u2019t the least bit important. What matters is your state of mind, your wisdom, and your cultivation!\u201cWith the methods and keen eyesight Master Su displayed that day, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to discover that he was a reclusive expert. Yet he turned out to be the ousted disciple of the Blueriver Sword Manor and the disdained live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family. That\u2019s far stranger!His gaze suddenly deepened. \u201cI can guarantee that Su Yi has secrets we can\u2019t possibly uncover. That\u2019s the scariest thing about him!\u201dXiao Tianque looked up. He could see that Zi Jin was still doubtful, so he laughed, \u201cNo need to overthink it, lass. Don\u2019t forget; since I started taking the concoction he prescribed me, my wounds have healed almost completely. He brought me back from the brink of death. This alone is enough to prove his capabilities!\u201dZi Jin nodded repeatedly. \u201cThe medicinal recipe he gave us really is mysterious.\u201dXiao Tianque suddenly recalled something, and he said gravely, \u201cTomorrow morning, we\u2019ll be meeting with Master Su. You must remember to mind your manners; you mustn\u2019t be the slightest bit negligent.\u201dZi Jin couldn\u2019t help but feel irritated. \u201cGrandpa, how many times have you told me that over the past few days? Do you really think I don\u2019t know how to behave myself?\u201dXiao Tianque burst into laughter, and he said casually, \u201cForgive my nagging. When we returned from the mountains that day, I thought I was sure to die. I never would have guessed a chance encounter with Master Su would give me a new lease on life. I\u2026. I\u2019m happy!\u201dSeth's ThoughtsIf it's not clear, a shop's signboard is like... a symbol of its reputation. Same goes for sects, clans, etc. If the sign breaks, it's an affront to the establishment's dignity. If someone breaks it, they're effectively slapping said establishment in the face.In this case, no literal signs are being targeted, but you do sometimes see that in this genre of novel. (And sometimes in other east Asian media. Take shounen manga. You ever seen someone attack a dojo? They'll often burn, destroy, or otherwise remove the sign as a show of dominance/superiority/victory.)___I took some liberties with the honorics here, and I tentatively plan to keep doing it. By itself, I tend to translate \u5927\u4eba as \"Your Excellency\", but when you add a name to that, it gets a bit clunky, wordy, and over the top, so I substituted appropriate, respectful English titles. As always, if I reconsider my approach, I'll mention it in the TL notes. Still figuring this out. ;) Thanks for bearing with me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Just Don\u2019t Do it AgainThe Wen Family estate, the clan hall.\u201cElder Brother, I just received word that the Huang Family guards took Su Yi, that wretch, to the Immortal Gathering House.\"\u00a0Wen Changqing hurried into the great hall, a broad smile on his face. \u201cUnless something unexpected happens, by the time they\u2019re done with that pipsqueak, he\u2019ll be a hair\u2019s breadth from death!\u201dHe was white-haired and whiskerless, with a sharp, sinister gaze. This was\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue\u2019s second uncle.\u201cA few days ago, he openly spouted utter nonsense, infuriating Young Master Wei Zhengyang. Someone\u2019s needed to teach him a lesson for a long time.\u201dFamily Head Wen Changjing said indifferently, \u201cWho\u2019d have guessed that before we even got the chance to discipline him, the brat would go out and offend a silkpants like Huang Qianjun? I\u2019ve never seen someone so intent on seeking death!\u201dSuddenly,\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changqing scrunched up his brow. \u201cThere\u2019s just one thing I don\u2019t understand. Wasn\u2019t Su Yi supposed to have lost his entire cultivation a year ago? So how is that he defeated Huang Qianjun and his thugs yesterday?\u201dWen Changjing shook his head. \u201cIt happened at the Immortal Gathering House, and none of us were present. We only have Wenxue\u2019s one-sided account; that can\u2019t prove anything.\u201dHe paused, then laughed coldly, \u201cNo matter what, I certainly don\u2019t believe a waste like him can stir up any waves!\u201dWen Changqing laughed along. \u201cI agree completely.\u201dHe first rose to prominence back when he was still a disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor and his cultivation was at the third level of the Blood Circulation Realm, the \u201cRefining Sinew\u201d stage. His sword arts were superb and transcendent, earning him his title as the outer sect\u2019s Sword Chief.But then, some time later, an accident robbed him of his entire cultivation. This left his blood and qi weakened, and his foundations were shattered. At the time, several major powers of the Blueriver Sword Manor tried to help him, but to no avail.The Blueriver Sword Manor cast him away, and Su Yi had been relegated to the role of \u201ccripple\u201d and \u201cwaste\u201d ever since.It wasn\u2019t just Wen Changjing and Wen Changqing that knew of this; in Guangling City, this was common knowledge.Given these circumstances, Wen Changjing refused to believe that Su Yi had any hope of cultivating the Martial Dao anew.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to discuss the boy any further,\u201d Wen Changjing said casually. \u201cTomorrow is the matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet. Huang Yunchong of the Huang Family will be in attendance. You can ask him about this then. He\u2019ll tell you what really happened at the Immortal Gathering House.\u201dSu Yi was just an insignificant live-in son-in-law. He was in no way worthy of their notice.\u201cChangqing, speaking of tomorrow\u2019s banquet, are all your preparations in order?\u201d asked Wen Changjing.Wen Changqing nodded. \u201cThe clans and factions on good terms with our Wen Family have all confirmed that they\u2019ll be at the banquet to help celebrate the matriarch\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s just\u2026.\u201dHe hesitated briefly, then whispered, \u201cElder Brother, as you know, our Wen Family\u2019s situation isn\u2019t what it used to be. We now occupy the lowest position of Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans. Given our current situation, convincing true VIPs to attend the birthday banquet won\u2019t be easy\u2026.\u201dWen Changjing furrowed his brow. \u201cWhere did you run into problems?\u201dWen Changqing grimaced. \u201cOver at the City Lord\u2019s Estate.\u201dThe City Lord\u2019s Estate!Wen Changjing\u2019s heart sank as he realized how serious the problem was.Over the past few years, the Wen Family\u2019s influence sank like a setting sun; they simply weren\u2019t what they used to be.By comparison, the other two members of the Three Great Clans, the Huang and Li Families, prospered more with each passing day, their forces flourishing.Their success only highlighted the Wen Family\u2019s predicament.Recently, numerous rumors had spread throughout the city. They said that within ten years, the Wen Family was sure to lose their position among \u201cthe Three Great Clans of Guangling City\u201d!This had already become a sore point for the Wen Family\u2019s higher-ups.As such, the family matriarch\u2019s eightieth birthday had become an affair of the utmost importance.Their goal was to use this birthday banquet to show off before the outside world. They wanted to tell everyone in Guangling City that the Wen Family\u2019s foundations were still in place, and that they wouldn\u2019t tolerate slander!The more important people in attendance, the better they could prove this point!In short, they\u2019d invited several important figures to help the Wen Family keep up appearances!The way the Wen Family\u00a0had it planned, if they successfully invited City Lord Fu Shan to tomorrow\u2019s birthday dinner, it was equivalent to inviting a pillar of support. That way, they\u2019d be able to keep up appearances with ease!When word spread to the populace, who would dare say the Wen Family had declined?\u201cIf City Lord Fu doesn\u2019t show up, I\u2019m afraid the other VIP guests will think that the current\u00a0Wen\u00a0Family\u2026.\u00a0Isn\u2019t enough\u00a0to move a \u2018godly\u2019 figure like the city lord\u2026.\u201dWen Changjing\u2019s expression gradually darkened. Then, he took a deep breath. His eyes bore into Wen Changqing, and when he spoke, he paused for emphasis between each word. \u201cGo back to the City Lord\u2019s Estate. No matter what you do, you must convince City Lord Fu to attend the birthday banquet!\u201dWen Changqing froze, and he muttered, \u201cElder Brother, I\u2019ve already visited them in person three times. Each time, they refused me at the door. I didn\u2019t even get an audience with the city lord\u2026.\u201dWen Changjing gnashed his teeth. \u201cVisit them once more. If City Lord Fu doesn\u2019t agree, just wait at his estate. I refuse to believe that, after all the years he\u2019s known our Wen Family, he\u2019ll refuse us forever.\u201dWen Changqing\u2019s heart sank, but he nodded and sighed with emotion, \u201cBack when the matriarch was still in Yujing City, who in Guangling City would have dared look down on us?\u201dWen Changjing was silent, but inwardly, his heart churned.Suddenly, a retainer rushed inside to deliver his report\u2014Su Yi had returned home!\u201cYou\u2019re certain he doesn\u2019t have any injuries at all?\u201d Wen Changqing couldn\u2019t help but ask. He was visibly astonished.The retainer thought about it seriously, then said, \u201cFrom the outside, he looks perfectly fine.\u201dWen Changqing was immediately stunned.\u00a0How is this possible!?Huang Qianjun endured such embarrassment. How could the Huang Family let Su Yi off so easily?Something\u2019s fishy about this!\u201cElder Brother, how do you see this?\u201d Wen Changqing couldn\u2019t help but glance at Wen Changjing.\u201cCompared to the birthday banquet tomorrow, what difference does it make whether Su Yi lives or dies?\u201d said Wen Changjing impatiently.Wen Changqing immediately fell silent.\u2026..The evening sunlight streamed through the window lattice, casting flecks of light onto the floor.Su Yi was soaking in a wooden bathtub, his eyes shut, breathing in and out. His handsome face was utterly tranquil.A long time passed before Su Yi let out a deep breath. It shot through forth like an arrow, firm yet lasting, with a faint boom vaguely reminiscent of thunder.Starting tomorrow, I\u2019ll have to switch to a new body-refining medicinal bath recipe.His cultivation had just reached the pinnacle of the first stage of the Body Refining Realm, the \u201cRefining Skin\u201d stage.The next stage was \u201cRefining Muscle\u201d!Refining muscle meant tempering the flesh, excavating and stimulating a body\u2019s latent potential. This elevated a cultivator\u2019s physique to yet another level.At the peak of this stage, the muscles were soft as jade when relaxed, and as firm as steel when tensed. Ordinary weapons could no longer penetrate the skin!When tempering the skin, the ingredients in my daily medicinal bath cost about five hundred taels. But when I start tempering my muscles, my daily medicinal expenditures will soar to fifteen hundred taels. That\u2019s the only way to achieve harmony with the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique, and it\u2019s necessary to achieve the strongest possible physique\u2026.Su Yi rose from his bath, got dressed, and sat beside the window, lost in thought.Only six days had passed since he began his cultivation anew. Although he\u2019d already reached the peak of the Refining Skin stage, he\u2019d also burned through a full three thousand taels of silver!Of the ten thousand silver Zi Jin first gave him, only seven thousand remained. Based on Su Yi\u2019s initial estimates, if he started his Refining Muscle stage cultivation, that seven thousand would only last him four or five days!Were he any ordinary man, he couldn\u2019t possibly have sustained such shocking expenditures.I\u2019ll need to find some time to take a look around the Azurecloud Mountains. It\u2019d be wonderful if I could find some spiritual medicines.Spiritual medicines were different from typical medicinal herbs, as they were born of and nourished in spiritual energy.Back in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, with the exception of medicines on the level of \u201ctreasures of heaven and earth\u201d, spiritual medicines of all grades were easily purchasable.But within the Great Zhou\u2019s borders, nevermind \u201cheavenly materials\u201d and \u201cearthly treasures\u201d; even ordinary spiritual medicines were rare, and all of them were incomparably precious, difficult to purchase even with a mountain of gold.But to Su Yi, this wasn\u2019t actually much of a problem.Within the Blood Circulation Realm, he didn\u2019t need spiritual medicines, or at least, he could substitute ordinary herbal medicines. At most, it would drag the process out and cost a little extra silver.Shortly after getting dressed, Su Yi got up and entered the courtyard, then started drilling the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique as he always did.The path of cultivation had always been incomparably arduous and dull. Those capable of persisting all had immense will and powerful spirits.That was the only way to make something of oneself!Especially since he wanted to transcend his past self. He naturally couldn\u2019t afford the slightest negligence!\u2026..Morning the next day.The skies had yet to brighten, but the entire Wen Family estate was bustling with activity.Today was the matriarch\u2019s eightieth birthday, and numerous VIP guests would soon grace their walls. News of tonight\u2019s event had long spread throughout Guangling City, and many were paying close attention. No one dared slack off.But all this commotion had nothing to do with Su Yi. After all, in their eyes, he was nothing but an insignificant little live-in son-in-law.As everyone else scurried about, he carried out his usual routine, stepping through the gates and strolling leisurely outside of the city along the banks of the Great Azure.After a while, Su Yi saw the mulberry grove. There were two figures waiting there already.They were none other than Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin.\u201cThis old man greets you, Master Su.\u201d When he saw Su Yi, Xiao Tianque perked up. He smiled broadly, then stepped up to greet him.His complexion was obviously much better than when they\u2019d first met.\u201cGreetings, Master Su!\u201d Zi Jin stepped forward and greeted him respectfully.Today, she wore a blue-green dress. Her skin was fair as snow, with willowy eyebrows, almond-shaped eyes, a graceful beauty with an outstanding figure.\u201cThe two of you surely know my identity by now. Don\u2019t you doubt me at all?\u201d Su Yi asked with great interest.Xiao Tianran said solemnly, \u201cWorldly men have always judged others by their appearance and status. Little do they know, those like you are the true experts!\u201dSu Yi laughed and shook his head. \u201cNo need to be so polite.\u201dZi Jin hesitated, then said apologetically, \u201cMaster Su, earlier, I was the one who arranged for people to investigate your background, as well as to monitor your movements in secret. However, I swear by the heavens themselves that I had no other intentions. If I\u2019ve displeased you, I humbly request your forgiveness.\u201dAs she spoke, she lowered her beautiful head and bowed.\u201cJust don\u2019t do it again.\u201d Su Yi nodded, and Zi Jin inwardly sighed in relief. Only then did she dare straighten her back.\u201cMaster Su, about my injuries\u2026.\u201d Xiao Tianque couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cWait just a moment. I\u2019ll attend to your wounds as soon as I\u2019ve completed my cultivation.\u201dAs Su Yi spoke, he stopped in a clearing amidst the mulberry trees. He held his breath, focused, and emptied his mind. Then, he gradually began practicing the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique.He completely disregarded the two pairs of eyes still watching him from not far away.Seth's ThoughtsNot sure if I clarified this yet, but the word \"master\" here? It's not an expression of submission or anything like that; it's basically \"sensei\" in Japanese.In an ordinary modern Chinese conversation, it's more like \"mister\", ie a generic but polite honorific used to address men. I considered translating it that way; it sounds natural, and in most contexts, that would be an accurate translation.But in more classical Chinese texts, genre fiction with a classical (or pseudo-classical) feel, and in modern Japanese and Korean, the term is reserved for teachers, doctors, and masters of their craft. That's how they're using it here, so I decided that \"mister\" was a bit misleading. Basically, they're being polite, but in a way that acknowledges Su Yi's abilities, not his status or background.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - A Tree Destined to Reach the CloudsMaster Su was about to practice martial arts in front of them!Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin glanced at each other. Despite themselves, they were curious, and they watched with rapt attention.Su Yi\u2019s movements were smooth and unhurried, but with every shift of his hands and feet, he emanated a unique, mysterious charm.Zi Jin could faintly discern an immortal crane spreading its wings amidst the nine heavens, soaring through the sea of clouds, free and and at ease as it wandered the skies.Suddenly, the scene changed. The crane became a towering, ancient tree, like the majestic backbone of its era, supporting heaven and earth with all their mountain and rivers, vast without limit!Zi Jin unwittingly found herself fixated. Her heart shook.\u00a0This\u2026 What level of Martial Dao cultivation method is this?\u201cHm?\u201d At the same time, Xiao Tianque\u2019s pupils constricted slightly.He could sense that as Su Yi\u2019s energy revolved, the spiritual energy around the mulberry grove was forming wisps and flowing towards Su Yi, like rivers flowing into the sea.What fist technique is this? It can actually draw spiritual power into his body?!\u00a0Xiao Tianque was stunned.His cultivation was at the third level of the Inner Furnace Realm. Within the Great Zhou, he was a Grandmaster of the Martial Dao. His name shook the nation, and his position was so lofty, the masses could only gaze at him from afar.Even so, this was his first time witnessing such a mysterious technique!It has the charm of the pine and crane, as well as an innate, transcendent truth! With every breath he takes, he pulls spiritual energy into him to refine his body. Could this be an \u2018Origin Realm Secret Art\u2019?Xiao Tianque\u2019s gaze was uncertain. He suddenly recalled a certain secret: rumor had it that when your cultivation broke past the Four Realms of the Martial Dao, after stepping onto the path of the Origin Dao, you could master the incredible secret \u2018Origin Arts\u2019!At that level of power, a single movement could cut down mountains or sever a river. You could breathe thunder and soar through the skies, like an immortal god.Experts of this level were called \u201cEarthly Immortals\u201d!And the secret arts of the Origin Realm were known as \u201cOrigin Arts!\u201dThey were miraculous inheritances that shook the old and illuminated the new, techniques that skillfully wrested control over fortune!Xiao Tianque was a Grandmaster of the Martial Dao, and he\u2019d once been fortunate enough to witness the bearing of a Earthly Immortal.As such, he could confirm that Origin Secret Arts really existed!When Su Yi finished practicing, Xiao Tianque reacted as if awakening from a dream. When he next looked at Su Yi, there was a subtle difference to his gaze.\u201cMaster Su, what level of cultivation technique are you practicing? It actually\u2026 It actually made me hallucinate,\u201d exclaimed Zi Jin. Her thoughts were nowhere near as complicated as her grandfather\u2019s; she just thought this secret art was unbelievable.\u201cIt\u2019s just a foundational technique,\u201d said Su Yi casually.Although the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique was arguably the top foundational technique of the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, it was still just a foundational technique. It was only used to temper the body during the Four Realms of the Martial Dao.\u201cA foundational technique\u2026.\u201d Zi Jin was stunned, and a bit baffled.\u00a0Can mere foundational techniques really be that mysterious?Su Yi didn\u2019t explain any further. His gaze turned towards Xiao Tianque. \u201cThere are two ways to treat the root of your injuries. First, I can write you another prescription. Within ten days, your injuries will clear up completely.\u201cHowever, if I do so, you\u2019ll remain at your current level for the rest of your life. You will never make any further breakthroughs in the Martial Dao.\u201dXiao Tianque\u2019s heart clenched. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMight I ask what the second option is?\u201dThe second option is simple,\u201d said Su Yi casually. \u201cAll you have to do is tell me the cultivation method you\u2019re using.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zi Jin cried out; she\u2019d obviously been caught off guard.Her grandfather, Xiao Tianque, practiced the \u201cGolden Billows Incantation.\u201d It was a secret art, an ancestral inheritance of the Lanling Xiao Family. Only disciples of the direct line of descent were qualified to cultivate it!How could they reveal it so easily?Xiao Tianque was clearly hesitant. Revealing their secret art was no small matter; it would affect the entire clan. Even though he was a Grandmaster of the Martial Dao, he had to think this over carefully.But soon, he grit his teeth and said, \u201cI choose the second option.\u201dZi Jin was obviously frantic, but Xiao Tianque shook his head, indicating that she needn\u2019t speak.Su Yi nodded. \u201cA smart choice.\u201dXiao Tianque then repeated the \u201cGolden Billows Incantion\u201d for him on the spot.Listening from the sidelines, Zi Jin realized that her grandfather hadn\u2019t hidden anything at all. Her heart shook.This is our clan\u2019s ultimate technique, passed down over generations!He\u2026. He revealed it, just like that?If the family found out about this, even Grandpa would be subject to immense criticism and pressure!It\u2019s even possible that they\u2019d do everything in their power to kill and silence Master Su!As Zi Jin\u2019s thoughst raced, Su Yi said, \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s as I suspected. Your cultivation technique is deeply flawed. If you relied on it to reach the third level of the Inner Furnace Realm, I\u2019m afraid you must have overcome potentially fatal danger on multiple occasions.\u201d\u201cFlaws?\u201d Zi Jin\u2019s lustrous eyes widened with disbelief.This is the inheritance Lanling\u2019s Xiao Family has used to protect itself for generations. It\u2019s been passed down for over a thousand years. It\u2019s a breathing technique publically recognized at top class!How\u2026. How could it possibly be flawed?Xiao Tianque, however, was recalling episodes from his past. He broke out into cold sweats, and his expression changed. \u201cIt\u2019s as you say, Master Su. This old man has encountered three potential fatal dangers on his path of cultivation. The first was when I advanced from the Qi Accumulation Realm to the Inner Furnace Realm. The other two instances were both within the Inner Furnace Realm.\u201d\u201cThat sounds about right,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cThat means that if I used the first method I proposed to heal you, even if you made a complete recovery, so long as you continued using the Golden Billows Incantation, it would be difficult to advance in the slightest. Trying might even lead to fatal danger.\u201dXiao Tianque could no longer remain calm. He said anxiously, \u201cThen what about the second method?\u201dSu Yi laughed. \u201cThis Golden Billows Incantation has significant flaws, but not enough to pose a problem for me. I\u2019ve already helped you improve it. Use this enhanced version, and you won\u2019t just heal completely from your injuries; you might even be able to proceed further down the Martial Dao.\u201dAs he spoke, he reached up and broke off a mulberry branch, then started writing on the ground.Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh~!One character after another appeared in the sandy dirt. The characters were grandiose and unrestrained, with big swoops and swirls, and the branch darted smoothly back and forth at top speed.Xiao Tianque unwittingly found himself transfixed. Before long, shock rose on his face. The more he saw, the more shocked he felt. By the end, his face was a mask of utter disbelief.Zi Jin looked too, but her insufficient cultivation limited her, and she couldn\u2019t fully fathom its profundities.Only when Su Yi finished writing did he toss the branch aside and say, \u201cOnly by writing it down can I ensure that you\u2019ll remember each and every character, without the slightest deviation. This will prevent misunderstandings.\u201dXiao Tianque closed his eyes and thought for a long time. Finally, he let out a long breath, then bowed solemnly to Su Yi. \u201cYou\u2019re like a limitless celestial, standing above the Martial Dao. You\u2019ve transformed something rotten into something magical; this is a complete, flawless secret art. Having it will bring my Lanling Xiao Family limitless benefit. Please, accept this bow!\u201dEvery word was solemn and sonorant. His voice contained excitement, respect, and also deep-rooted shock, all of it straight from the heart.Zi Jin found herself at a loss. She just stood there in a daze.\u00a0This\u2026.Su Yi calmly accepted Xiao Tianque\u2019s bow, then waved his hand. \u201cEnough. This matter is already resolved, and I ought to head back.\u201dWith that, he turned to leave.\u201cPlease, wait up!\u201d Xiao Tianque hurried after him, then took out a jade medallion and passed it to Su Yi with both hands. \u201cSir, this is the insignia of the Lanling Xiao Family. Please, accept it.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201dXiao Tianque hurriedly explained, \u201cI am well aware that you\u2019re extraordinary, but if you walk in the world of the mundane, you\u2019ll almost invariably encounter mundane troubles and trivial inconveniences. Given your temperament, I\u2019m sure you dislike such petty matters disturbing you.\u201cAt least within the nineteen cities of Cloudriver Prefecture, this command medallion should be enough to make those mundane problems melt away. Take it as\u2026 Take is a token of the Lanling Xiao Family\u2019s good will.With that, he added, \u201cOf course, what you\u2019ve done for us today is far more than a mere command medallion can repay. Going forward, if you run into problems, anything at all, we won\u2019t refuse any request!\u201dSu Yi accepted the token. \u201cThis display of good will is a bit surprising. Thanks.\u201dEven as he spoke, he was already turning around to leave.Xiao Tianque clasped his fist and watched him leave. Only after Su Yi disappeared from view did he relax. A smile rose on his gaunt face.\u00a0I finally\u2026.. Established a bit of a connection with Master Su!\u201cGrandpa, is Master Su\u2019s revised Golden Billows Incantation really\u2026 Is it really that incredible?\u201d Zi Jin had watched all of this play out, and it waves through her heart. She could no longer hold back from voicing her questions.Xiao Tianque sighed with emotion, \u201cHe merely heard me describe the Golden Billows Incantation once, but that was enough for him to determine the near-fatal dangers I\u2019ve encountered on my road of cultivation. Then, in less than an instant, he revised the incantation and eliminated its flaws. How could something like that merely be \u2018incredible\u2019? It\u2019s no different from turning stone to gold or garbage to treasure with a single touch!\u201dAs he spoke, he turned to Zi Jin, a broad smile on his face. \u201cLass, you\u2019re still young, and you don\u2019t understand. After undergoing Master Su\u2019s revisions, our clan\u2019s inheritance, the Golden Billows Incantation, has completely changed. Going forward, our Xiao Family\u2026. Is certain to see Grandmasters spring up in far greater numbers!\u201dZi Jin was finally starting to understand, and she couldn\u2019t help but get excited. \u201cThis\u2026. That\u2019s wonderful!\u201d\u201cDo you dare say even now that Master Su is nothing but the Wen Family\u2019s live-in son-in-law?\u201d asked Xiao Tianque with a smile.Zi Jin was instantly shamefaced. She said awkwardly, \u201cGrandpa, I really didn\u2019t see the bigger picture earlier. I was ignorant and narrow-minded.\u201dXiao Tianque looked at his transcendently beautiful granddaughter and said amiably, \u201cOrdinary men cannot determine which trees will one day soar into the clouds. Only after a tree breaks through the canopy and towers over the rest of the forest do they realize its magnificence. Su Yi is still young, and he\u2019s hidden himself within the mundane world. He is just like a tree destined to reach the clouds. We were fortunate enough to encounter someone of his level, so we ought to do everything we can to build a relationship with him!\u201d\u201cGrandpa,\u201d said Zi Jin, \u201cAre you trying to rope Master Su in?\u201d\u201cRope him in?\u201d Xiao Tianque laughed. \u201cHow could someone so distinguished serve beneath another? A Grandmaster of the Martial Dao can only look up to someone of his skill. Perhaps\u2026. Only Earthly Immortals are qualified to discuss the Dao with him as equals?\u201dOnly Earthly Immortals were qualified to compare themselves to Su Yi?\u00a0The more Zi Jin heard, the more surprised she felt.\u201cBesides, Master Su is still a young man. The heights of his future accomplishments are sure to be beyond our imagination!\u201d Xiao Tianque\u2019s eyes flashed like fire. \u201cIf we\u2019re to build an amiable relationship with someone like him, we have to treat him with the utmost sincerity!\u201cWe\u2019ve already established a line of communication with him. All I can say is, this is an enormous stroke of fortune, both for me, and for our entire Xiao Family!\u201dA tidal wave of emotion swept over Zi Jin, and quite some time passed before she calmed down.After a while, the dazed look in her eyes gave way to determination, and she said softly, \u201cGrandpa, please be at ease. I\u2019ll be certain to seize this opportunity!\u201dSeth's ThoughtsThe title of this chapter, as well as the line of dialogue it references, come from a poem by Tang Dynasty poet Du Xunhe. The poem is \u201cXiao Song\u201d or \u201cLittle Pine\u201d, and the line in question is \u201c\u65f6\u4eba\u4e0d\u8bc6\u51cc\u4e91\u6728\uff0c\u76f4\u5f85\u51cc\u4e91\u59cb\u9053\u9ad8.\u201dI did some digging, but the only translations I found seemed overly literal for my needs, so I did my own, taking some minor liberties for flow and clarity.Erudite_Birdy did some further digging on my behalf and posted it in the comments.

    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - The Birthday BanquetThe Wen Family.When Su Yi returned, he saw a dense flow of human traffic. Servants were as numerous as the clouds, and the entire estate was extraordinarily lively.Today was the matriarch\u2019s eightieth birthday, and the Wen Family had been busy with preparations for days.It wasn\u2019t just the branch members who\u2019d come to join in the festivities; many major powers and members of factions on good terms with the Wen Family had come to celebrate too.\u00a0Word of tonight\u2019s birthday banquet had spread throughout Guangling City, and everyone was paying attention.Su Yi, however, wasn\u2019t concerned about any of this.\u00a0He was just an overlooked live-in son-in-law. No one would ask any questions if he didn\u2019t participate.Or so he thought.\u201cBrother-in-law!\u201d Just as Su Yi returned home, he saw a petite, graceful figure standing there waving at him. Her elegantly beautiful face was nothing but smiles.At sixteen, Wen Lingxue was a pure and blossoming beauty.\u201cWhat are you standing there for?\u201d Su Yi smiled back.\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you, of course.\u201d Wen Lingxue stepped up to greet him and affectionately wrapped her arm around his. \u201cBrother-in-law, just now, my mom said that when you got back, you were to participate in the birthday banquet too.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Su Yi was stunned.Wen Lingxue explained, \u201cShe said it was on my grandmother\u2019s orders.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s eyes narrowed.Wen Lingxue\u2019s grandmother was none other than the Wen Family matriarch, Liang Wenbi. She occupied a transcendent position within the family; even Family Head Wen Changjing dared not go against her orders.A year ago, it was Liang Wenbi who personally decided his and Wen Lingzhao\u2019s marriage agreement. Wen Lingzhao, her parents, and the other clansmen\u2019s objections made no difference at all!Su Yi nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter reawakening the memories of his past life, he\u2019d thought to himself that he ought to find an opportunity to talk to the family matriarch and ask about what happened back then.The scattered residences of the Wen Family estate were bustling with activity as guests came, one after another, to offer their congratulations.The Wen Family was one of Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans, and their foundations and connections were exceptional. The current leader was Wen Changjing, who had two younger brothers: Wen Changqing and Wen Changtai.Them aside, the\u00a0Wen Family had several branches, which split off and formed even more branches over time. Today, the Wen Family numbered over a thousand people in total.Today, countless clansmen would reconnect, and numerous guests would converge, resulting in an extraordinary spectacle.The area around the clan hall had long since been prepared, and it now held a sumptuous feast.\u201cLingxue, you\u2019re here!\u201d As soon as Su Yi and Wen Lingxue arrived, the numerous youths waiting outside the clan hall called out to her in greeting, one after another.These were members of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation, and most of them were close to Wen Lingxue in age.However, without exception, their brows furrowed when they saw Su Yi. They pointedly ignored him.Except for one youth in brocade robes. \u201cSu Yi,\u201d he said in obvious displeasure, \u201cWho do you think you are? There\u2019s no seat for you here. Hurry up and leave. Don\u2019t even think about ruining the mood!\u201dWen Shaobei.He was a handsome, talented member of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation.However, he was born into a branch family, so his status was inferior to Wen Lingxue and other main-branch disciples.As soon as Wen Shaobei spoke up, the others laughed and chimed in their agreement.Su Yi had married into the family as a live-in son-in-law, and throughout the past year, everyone in the family looked down on him. Worse, they saw him as a good-for-nothing. Even the servants dared mock him openly.Wen Lingxue scowled. \u201cWen Shaobei, listen up! It was my grandmother who told me to\u00a0bring Brother-in-law\u00a0to join us at the banquet! Now you\u2019re trying to kick him out? Are you trying to go against my grandmother\u2019s wishes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d Wen Shaobei was instantly at a loss for words. The others were stunned as well, and their jaws clamped shut. There was no way they\u2019d dare go against the matriarch\u2019s orders!\u201cLet\u2019s just chat on our own,\u201d he said, feigning casual ease. \u201cWe can just pretend\u00a0he\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dThe members of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation immediately formed a circle, excluding Su Yi and ignoring him completely, as if he were invisible.Since Wen Lingxue stood with him, they ignored her too.Su Yi naturally wouldn\u2019t concern himself over something like this. He called Wen LIngxue over to the side and whispered, \u201cLingxue, after the birthday banquet, come pay me a visit. I have something to give you.\u201d\u201cAh? What is it?\u201d she asked curiously.Su Yi smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201dAlmost immediately after he said this, someone cried out, \u201cCousin Jueyuan is here!\u201dWen Shaobei and the girls all looked over. Even some of the nearby guests and elders\u00a0stared.They then saw a youth in white robes approaching from a distance. He had sharp, sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes, and he looked dignified and impressive. His looks and bearing stood out from the crowd.\u201cWen Yueyuan! The most outstanding talent of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation!\u201d someone sighed.\u201cAh, so it was Cousin Jueyuan.\u201d Wen Lingxue\u2019s pretty face lit up with admiration too.Wen Jueyuan was the son of Family Head Wen Changjing. He entered Pinecloud Sword Manor at nine years old. At thirteen, he became a disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect. Then, just four short years later, he was promoted to the inner sect in a single attempt.He\u2019d spent his life cultivating, and he\u2019d already reached the fourth layer of the Blood Circulation Realm, \u201cRefining Bone\u201d!This level of accomplishment was, within Guangling City, enough to make even major powers sigh over their own inferiority!Wen Jueyuan was already effectively the leader of the family\u2019s younger generation!He walked over and looked at\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue, Wen Shaobei, and the other youths, then gently commanded, \u201cToday is my grandmother\u2019s birthday. You\u2019d best be on your best behavior. Don\u2019t do anything to embarrass the family in front of our guests.\u201dAs for Su Yi? Wen Jueyuan ignored him too.\u201cYes.\u201d All of them hurriedly voiced their agreement.Wen Jueyuan nodded, but said no more. Instead, he walked directly into the clan hall and took a seat.At tonight\u2019s banquet, only high-ranked elders and the very pinnacle of the younger generation were qualified to dine within the clan hall!The likes of Wen Lingxue and Wen Shaobei currently had no such qualifications.Thus, when they looked at\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan, their gazes carried a hint of irrepressible jealousy. They couldn\u2019t help wondering when they\u2019d make it to that level too.\u201cIf my big sister was here, she could definitely sit inside,\u201d said Wen Lingxue with an air of regretNo one argued with her. Wen Lingzhao was already a disciple of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy! That status alone qualified her to sit with the family higher-ups as their equal.\u201cI heard that this birthday banquet is different,\u201d whispered one of the girls seated near Wen Shaobei. \u201cIt\u2019s of the utmost importance to the entire Wen Family.\u201dAnother youth added, \u201cI heard from my father that damaging rumors about the Wen Family are spreading throughout the city. There are people saying that we\u2019re sure to lose our place among the Three Great Clans within ten years.\u201dYet another youth muttered, \u201cWe\u2019re hosting this banquet specifically to resolve this issue. The more influential characters who participate, the better it\u2019ll be for the family. If we make a good enough showing, those damaging rumors will disappear on their own.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see how capable First and Second Uncle are,\u201d said Wen Shaobei. \u201cAs for Third Uncle, heh heh\u2026.\u201dHe glanced at the nearby Wen Lingxue, but left the rest unsaid.Within the Wen Family\u2019s main line of descent, Wen Changjing was the family head and held the most authority. He also had the most extensive network, and he never had any shortage of famous and influential guests.Wen Changqing was the main line\u2019s second\u00a0elder, and he was in charge of the family\u2019s properties and businesses. He, too, had a deep and expensive network.Wen Changtai was different. Although he was the main line\u2019s third elder, he had an unsophisticated nature, and his talent was mediocre. Add that to a weak cultivation, and he had few connections at all. His position within the family wasn\u2019t at all high.If he weren\u2019t Wen Changjing and Wen Changqing\u2019s little brother, others might even look down on him.Although Wen Shaobei left the rest of his words unsaid, how could Wen Lingxue miss what he was implying?Her beautiful face darkened into a scowl. He made fun of Su Yi earlier, and now he was talking smack about her father. Of course she was angry!And yet, she couldn\u2019t really argue.She knew full well that her father\u2026 really was a bit overly unexceptional\u2026.As she thought this, she felt stifled, and her spirits sank.It was then that a big hand patted her on the shoulder. Immediately afterward, Su Yi whispered in her ear, \u201cLingxue, during our time on this planet, we\u2019ll inevitably become the targets of cold glances and mocking words. If you\u2019re weaker than the person insulting you, there\u2019s no harm in enduring their insults. But if you endure and retreat blindly even when you\u2019re strong enough to fight back, you\u2019ll only encourage their arrogant blustering.\u201dWen Lingxue thought it over, then took a deep breath. \u201cI understand, Brother-in-law.\u201dWith that, she walked right up to Wen Shaobei and said icily, \u201cApologize.\u201dHer gaze was clear, but her words were cold as ice. Wen Shaobei and the other youths were whispering amongst themselves when they stopped, dazed.\u201cLingxue, what do you mean by that? We were just chatting. How did we offend you?\u201d Wen Shaobei furrowed his brow.Wen Lingxue seemed incomparably imposing, and her clear eyes flashed like thunder as they bore into Wen Shaobei.\u201cIf you don\u2019t apologize,\u201d she said, pausing for emphasis between each word, \u201cI\u2019ll go tell my uncles everything you just said. I\u2019ll be curious to see whether they let you off or not!\u201d\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Wen Shaobei looked uncertain. Those beside him had all shut their mouths, not daring to get involved.No matter what, Wen Lingxue was a member of the main bloodline!Her father was the third\u00a0elder\u00a0of the main bloodline, Family Head Wen Changjing\u2019s biological younger brother. In terms of status, mere branch members like them couldn\u2019t even begin to compare to her.And\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue\u2019s older sister, Wen Lingzhao, was now a disciple of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. Even the family head attached enormous importance to her!If, under these circumstances, Wen Lingxue disclosed this matter, there was no need to even question it: Wen Shaobei was the one who\u2019d get in trouble.\u201cI\u2019ll say it once more: apologize!\u201dAs everyone watched, Wen Shaobei\u2019s expression changed in rapid succession, and a long time passed before he said anything. Wen Lingxue\u2019s expression grew frostier and frostier. She was just a sixteen-year-old girl, but her anger was shockingly constricting and oppressive.Finally, Wen Shaobei lowered his head and whispered, his voice as quiet as a gnat, \u201cI\u2026. I was wrong\u2026.\u201dWen Lingxue\u2019s heart instantly filled with indescribable delight, but her voice went cold. \u201cSpeak up; I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201dWen Shaobei reacted as if he\u2019d been beaten. He slumped, then said bitterly, \u201cWenxue, I was wrong. Please, don\u2019t take this any further.\u201dThe others, meanwhile, were silent as cicadas in winter.Su Yi watched as this played out, and he couldn\u2019t help but nod to himself.Everyone had to grow up sooner or later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - When Heaven and Earth Are on Your SideWhen Wen Lingxue returned to Su Yi\u2019s side, her cold demeanor disappeared, like an icy lake melting and revealing the warm waters below. Her beautiful eyes shone.\u201cBrother-in-law, this feels great!\u201d The young woman\u2019s gaze revealed a thread of excitement.Su Yi laughed, then offered her another pointer. \u201cWhen conducting yourself in society, knowing how to use your position is a type of knowledge, like sailing with the wind or swimming with the current. Some incredible cultivators can even call upon the power of heaven and earth to prove their dao.\u201cBut at the same time, borrowed power never lasts. An ancient poem states \u2018when your situation is advantageous, it seems as though heaven and earth themselves are on your side, but when fortune departs, even a hero struggles to retain their freedom.\u2019 If you rely on external power, external power will eventually cast you away.\u201dWhen she heard this, Wen Lingxue sank into thought. \u201cBrother-in-law, you\u2018re saying that when you take advantage of your situation, you have to know the proper limits, and that at the end of the day, what matters most is becoming strong in your own right. Is that it?\u201dSu Yi smiled and nodded. She was clever. Some things, he merely needed to touch on for her to understand.Not far away, a pair of hateful eyes bore into Su Yi.This gaze belonged to Wen Shaobei.He dared not offend Wen Lingxue, so he planned to vent his rage on Su Yi instead.Furthermore, he was confident that there was nothing she could do about it. This was because, throughout the entire Wen Family, no one else cared if Su Yi got bullied.Su Yi naturally noticed his gaze, but he paid it no heed.\u00a0If that kid dares try anything, I\u2019ll naturally teach him how to behave himself.He and Wen Lingxue sat at one of the drinking tables. However, Wen Lingxue gradually realized that something was amiss. All the other tables were packed, the guests chatting and laughing amongst themselves. They looked vibrant and bustling.Their table, however, only had the two of them. They were strikingly, unusually alone, the sight impossible to miss.\u201cBrother-in-law\u2026..\u201d Wen Lingxue glanced at Su Yi. She was a bit angry, but also a bit concerned.There was no way she\u2019d miss that both the Wen clansmen and the banquet guests looked at Su Yi as if he were some god of plague, or as if they feared nothing more than failing to avoid him!Su Yi, however, seemed perfectly at ease. He lifted his cup of wine, refilled it, then laughed, \u201cNone in attendance are worthy of drinking with us, that\u2019s all.\u201dWen Lingxue couldn\u2019t help but cover her mouth and laugh. She finally relaxed.A cute little boy was headed in their direction. He looked about six or seven, and it was obvious that he was looking for a place to sit.\u201cLittle Mingrong, come sit with me!\u201d Wen Lingxue gleefully waved him over.The boy agreed excitedly, but when he saw Su Yi, he immediately stopped in his tracks and let out a crisp shout, \u201cI, Wen Mingrong, might be young, but even I disdain to consort with a live-in son-in-law like Su Yi!\u201dThroughout the surrounding area, the lively atmosphere came to sudden standstill. Everyone\u2019s expressions went strange. Then, they burst into laughter. The air filled with the sound of revelry.Wen Shaobei and his companions clutched their bellies and guffawed, unable to control themselves.Children spoke without scruples, but that meant that they were the most honest of all.His single sentence was enough to reveal just how low Su Yi\u2019s status in the Wen Family really was!Wen Lingxue\u2019s beautiful face frosted over, and she shot the little boy a vicious glare. Even so, she naturally wouldn\u2019t argue with a child.When she turned to Su Yi, it seemed he hadn\u2019t even noticed. He was happily drinking away, perfectly content.\u2026\u2026Within the clan hall.Qin Qing was decidedly displeased.The seats were packed, prominent figures as numerous as the clouds, but practically all of them were clustered around Family Head Wen Changjing and Second Elder Wen Changqing.Almost no one so much as inquired at Wen Changtai\u2019s table. She and her husband just sat there, alone and ignored. It couldn\u2019t have been any more awkward.The feeling of being so blatantly ignored left Qin Qing with a bellyful of resentment. \u201cLook at your older brothers! Now, look at yourself! It seems I can\u2019t count on you ever making something of yourself!\u201dQin Qing glared viciously at Wen Changtai. Inwardly, she was overcome with regret. Had she known things would turn out this way, she would have sent her elder daughter a letter and called her back. As a disciple of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, she could have at least helped them maintain appearances.\u201cHahhh\u2026 We\u2019re family, so why say something like that?\u201d Wen Changtai sighed.This only made Qin Qing\u2019s temper flare up. She whispered, \u201cLook at the branch family members! Even they\u2019re making fun of us! Even your eldest brother\u2019s son, Jueyuan, has outshined our entire family!\u201dIt seemed as if she were venting all her complaints at once. \u201cIf you were even the least bit competent, we wouldn\u2019t be in such an awkward position, now would we?\u201dWen Changtai grimaced, but he didn\u2019t dare argue.As they spoke, influential figures offered their congratulations, one after another. Every last one of them came bearing lavish gifts, making the matriarch beam with delight.Throughout this process, Family Head Wen Changjing and Second Elder Wen Changqing exchanged pleasantries with their distinguished guests. They both seemed high-spirited and energetic.Qin Qing watched his play out. She felt like she were sitting on a bed of needles.It was then of all times that a certain childish voice boomed throughout the hall, \u201cI, Wen Mingrong, might be young, but even I disdain to consort with a live-in son-in-law like Su Yi!\u201dThis voice had come out of nowhere, but everyone in the great hall heard it. The lively atmosphere instantly came to a standstill.Immediately afterward, the sound of uproarious laughter emanated from outside. Those inside the clan hall couldn\u2019t help but laugh along.Su Yi!Who in Guangling City didn\u2019t know of the Wen Family\u2019s live-in son-in-law?\u201cWhose kid was that? He\u2019s got such spirit at such a young age. His future is limitless!\u201d A silver-whiskered elder laughed.This only invited yet another round of laughter.Qin Qing felt her cheeks redden. She looked at her mediocre husband, then recalled Su Yi, her son-in-law. Despite herself, she felt utterly dismal.It\u2019s bad enough that I found myself a useless man, but even my daughter\u2019s husband is a good-for-nothing! Why are the heavens so unfair?But then, before the boisterous laughter died down, hey heard another voice from afar:\u201cFamily Head Huang Yunchong has come to offer congratulations on behalf of the Huang Family!\u201dThroughout the great hall, everyone instantly grew serious.In Guangling City, the Huang Family occupied a rock-solid position as the second of the Three Great Clans.Huang Yunchong, moreover, had shaken the entire city. He wielded true power and authority.Although there were numerous influential figures gathered within the clan hall, in terms of status, practically none of them were remotely comparable to Huang Yunchong.\u201cPlease, come right this way,\u201d said the family matriarch from the seat of honor. She was smiling.Regardless of any prior grudges between the Huang and Wen Families, that the head of the Huang Family would come here in person was an enormous honor. It reflected well on the entire Wen Family.Wen Changjing and Wen Changqing immediately rose and prepared to welcome him.Outside the clan hall, the various Wen clansmen and guests all glanced over.Before long, they saw the valiant, purple-robed Huang Yunchong walk inside. His son, Huang Qianjun, was right behind him, followed by two elderly retainers.In this formation, they were like stars clustered around the radiant moon.\u201cThe head of the Huang Family!\u201d\u201cUncle Huang is here too?\u201d\u201cBrother Huang, what a pleasant surprise! We\u2019re flattered that you\u2019d visit us in person.\u201dAs Huang Yunchong strode along the path, the guests called out their greetings, their expressions humble and even toadyish.Even the Wen clansmen wore respectul, fervent looks on their faces.The young Huang Qianjun walked behind his father, looking proud and aloof. He\u2019d long since grown accustomed to scenes like this.Suddenly, Huang Yunchong paused mid-step, his gaze drawn to a certain location.The crowd followed his gaze. Throughout the surrounding area, practically everyone had risen to greet Family Head Huang. The one exception was a certain table occupied by just two people, one man and one woman. Neither of them had moved in the slightest, and the sight was jarring.They were none other than Su Yi and Wen Lingxue.No manners!\u00a0Many of the guests inwardly shook their heads.The Wen clansmen, meanwhile, furrowed their brows.\u00a0The esteemed head of the Huang Family paid us a personal visit. How can they remain seated so ostentatiously?One of the elders cleared his throat, but just as he was about to rebuke Su Yi and Wen Lingxue, his eyes widened.He\u2019d just watched as Huang Yunchong hurried up to their table, bowed slightly at the waist, and clasped his fist. \u201cYoung Lord Su.\u201dThe entire venue fell silent. Everyone looked utterly baffled.Su Yi seemed to have only just reacted. He glanced up at Huang Yunchong. \u201cHere to offer birthday greetings?\u201dHuang Yunchong nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Su Yi. With that, he looked away and poured himself another cup of wine, paying Huang Yunchong no further heed.But Huang Yunchong wasn\u2019t the least bit upset. He seemed to think it perfectly natural that Su Yi wouldn\u2019t rise or bow in greeting.Many of those present were stunned; they almost didn\u2019t dare believe their eyes.It was then that Family Head Wen Changjing hurried over. He smiled broadly and clasped his fist. \u201cBrother Huang, what an honor to have you here! Please excuse me for not going out to meet you by the gate. Please, come with me. Let\u2019s talk further in the clan\u2019s great hall.\u201dWhen he saw that Su Yi had no objections, Huang Yunchong straightened his back. His presence seemed to change; he now looked utterly dignified and arrogant.\u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you, then.\u201d Huang Yunchong nodded to Wen Changjing, then followed him into the clan hall.Those remaining outside watched in a daze. The entire venue fell briefly silent.\u201cWhy was Family Head Huang so polite to that live-in son-in-law?\u201dWaves rose in many of the onlookers\u2019 hearts. They were simply shocked.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Wen Shaobei and the other Wen clansmen were at a loss. How lofty was Huang Yunchong\u2019s status? Why would he take the initiative to greet someone as lowly as Su Yi?The nearby guests\u2019 expressions went strange as well. They sensed that something wasn\u2019t quite right about this.\u201cBrother-in-law, this\u2026.\u201d Wen Lingxue was rather confused as well. Her bright eyes flicked towards Su Yi.\u201cI beat up Huang Qianjun just a few days ago, right? Well, around noon yesterday, Huang Yunchong took the initiative to apologize to me at the Immortal Gathering House.\u201d Su Yi smiled. \u201cGoing forward, you needn\u2019t worry about the Huang Family making trouble for you.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Wen Lingxue was so stunned, she couldn\u2019t even speak.Su Yi\u2019s tone was too casual; she didn\u2019t know if she ought to take his words seriously or not.At that moment, within the clan hall, many of the VIP guests sensed something was amiss as well. Huang Yunchong became the center of attention as soon as he arrived.Huang Yunchong ignored the crowd\u2019s stares and walked right up to the matriarch. He ordered, \u201cSomeone, present our birthday gift.\u201dAn elderly servant immediately stepped forth of proferred a jade box. \u201cMatriarch, this is the gift the master of our house has prepared for you. With this pair of carved hundred-year agate scepters, we wish you all the longevity of the southern mountains and success in all your endeavors.\u201dThe matriarch was instantly tickled pink, and she smiled. \u201cYour presence alone is an incomparable delight. What need is there for presents? Changjing, hurry and guide Family Head Huang to his seat.\u201dWen Changjing smiled and called out to him. \u201cBrother Huang, this way please.\u201dHowever, to his surprise, Huang Yunchong merely waved. \u201cJust a moment.\u201dThen, as the onlookers watched in disbelief, he stepped up to Wen Changtai and Qin Qing\u2019s table, smiled, and clasped his fist. \u201cBrother Changtai, Sister Qin Qing, I heard that your daughter has entered Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy to continue her cultivation. This is rare, wonderful news! I\u2019ve come bearing a humble congratulatory gift. Please, take it as a token of my good intentions. Whatever you do, you mustn\u2019t refuse it.\u201dSeth's ThoughtsThe line \u201cwhen your situation is advantageous, it seems as though heaven and earth themselves are on your side, but when fortune departs, even a hero struggles to retain their freedom\u201d comes from Tang Dynasty poet Luo Yin\u2019s poem, \u201cAt Choubi Station\u201d.I couldn\u2019t find an official/professional translation for this one either, so just like the other poems we\u2019ve seen thus far, I translated it myself. I did, however, find a reference to it\u00a0in an article about Chinese credit traders of all things.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - An Ill-Intentioned GuestAs soon as Huang Yunchong finished speaking, an elderly retainer stepped forth, proffering a jade box with both hands.He handed it to the couple, saying, \u201cSir, Madam, this box contains two pieces of Nine-Leafed King Ginseng. The master of the house has prepared them for Su Yi and his wife. Kindly accept them on their behalf.\u201dNine-Leafed King Ginseng!The group gathered in the hall could no longer remain calm.Many of these prominent figures\u2019 hearts shook, and their expressions changed.This was a true \u201cspiritual medicine\u201d, a precious treasure of shocking value. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t purchasable at any ordinary market!A lavish gift! An absolutely lavish gift!Who would have guessed that the esteemed head of the Huang Family, in addition to offering birthday greetings, would personally prepare such an enormous present for the least prestigious of the Wen Family\u2019s three main-line elders and his family?Even\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changjing and Wen Changqing were stunned and uncertain; they couldn\u2019t tell what Huang Yunchong was thinking.Qin Qing and Wen Changtai could no longer remain seated, and they hurriedly rose to their feet, shocked and flattered.\u201cThank\u2026. Thank you\u2026!\u201d Wen Changtai hurriedly clasped his fist, and when he spoke, it was with a bit of a stutter. He\u2019d always been a simple, honest sort. When had he ever experienced anything like this?Huang Yunchong smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a good daughter, and a good son-in-law, too!\u201dHe particularly emphasized the word \u201cson-in-law\u201d, his tone carrying a subtle hint of emotion.Wen Changtai felt immensely gratified, and he broke into a huge smile. For the head of the Huang Family to praise them so highly was an honor.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that this pair of Nine-Leafed King Ginseng is for Lingzhao?\u201d Qin Qing was still hesitant, as if she dared not believe what was happening. She couldn\u2019t help but ask for confirmation.Huang Yunchong glanced at the elderly attendant, who hurriedly explained, \u201cMadam, this gift is for your daughter\u00a0and\u00a0for your son-in-law.\u201dQin Qing instantly smiled. Whether the gift was for her daughter or for her son-in-law, it was all the same to her!What pleased her most was that, before, Wen Changtai\u2019s table had been desolate, and practically no one had even bothered to greet them. Yet now, Huang Yunchong had shown up, and he didn\u2019t just greet them; he even gave them a generous present! In doing so, he\u2019d made them the center of attention.This feeling was unquestionably blissful!Lingzhao, that girl, is really coming along nicely! She didn\u2019t even come back for the banquet, but she\u2019s still made her old mom look good!\u00a0Qin Qing thought to herself in satisfaction.Huang Yunchong said no more. He\u2019d already made himself clear enough. Whether Wen Changtai and his wife understood or not was their problem.Just knowing that he\u2019d given this present, which was primarily intended for Su Yi as an \u201capology gift\u201d, put Huang Yunchong at ease.Su Yi might not care about a paltry gift like that, but he\u2019s sure to sense that our Huang Family is effectively lowering its head and offering a sincere apology. That ought to be enough,\u00a0Huang Yunchong thought to himself.\u201cBrother Huang, please, take a seat.\u201d Wen Changjing smiled and walked over to invite Huang Yunchong over once more.This time, Huang Yunchong didn\u2019t refuse. However, before taking his seat, he turned to Huang Qianjun and said, \u201cYou go sit outside.\u201dHuang Qianjun was stunned for a moment, but then he seemed to understand. He immediately turned and left the clan hall.He didn\u2019t even look at the other tables. Instead, he steeled himself and walked straight over to Su Yi\u2019s table. In a low voice, he said sheepishly, \u201cBrother Su\u2026.\u201dSu Yi glanced at the formerly arrogant hoodlum. Huang Qianjun now looked meek and submissive.\u201cToday, you\u2019re here as a guest,\u201d said Su Y casually. \u201cI, however, am not the host. Sit wherever you please.\u201dHuang Qianjun reacted as if an enormous weight had been lifted from his shoulders, and he immediately but cautiously took a seat.Wen Lingxue\u2019s brows knit faintly, and she seemed a bit confused.\u00a0Huang Qianjun seems somewhat different today, as if he\u2019s guilty about what he\u2019s done. He looks downright honest and obedient.Is this still that same arrogant, vicious silkpants?Those nearby felt dizzy. They looked at each other, unsure of what was going on. Even Wen Shaobei and his companions could tell that something wasn\u2019t quite right, and their expressions were full of confusion.Su Yi, the disregarded live-in son-in-law, was drinking with great relish. Meanwhile, Huang Qianjun, the silkpants famous throughout the city, was sitting there, mild and reserved.This scene was jarringly out of place.However, no one would offer any explanations.Su Yi wouldn\u2019t say anything, and Huang Qianjun naturally wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to broadcast his own humiliation.All of a sudden, the surrounding atmosphere turned rather strange.Shortly after, yet another voice rang out from the distance, \u201cLi Tianhan, head of the Li Family, is here to offer his congratulations!\u201dThe entire venue burst into uproar, and many of the guests could no longer remain seated.The Li Family was the most powerful in Guangling City, and the current family head, Li Tianhan, had a vast and powerful network in addition to being capable in his own right. He had connections with many major clans throughout Cloudriver Prefecture.And everyone in Guangling City knew that the Li and Wen Families were on poor terms!Especially recently. Once the Wen Family declined, the Li Family started watching them hungrily, and they made numerous attempts to annex the various businesses under the Wen Family\u2019s control.It was fair to say that the two families\u2019 relationship was as tense as it could get, and while their grudge wasn\u2019t necessarily irreconcilable, they already saw each other as enemies.Yet now, Family Head Li Tianhan had appeared to wish the Wen Family matriarch a happy birthday?Was he really here to congratulate her?Or did he have other plans?As the crowd questioned his intentions, a gaunt, straight-backed man in long, navy blue robes walked over from afar.His cold eyes flashed like lightning, and his stride was as powerful as a dragon or\u00a0tiger\u2019s. His every movement gave off a formless, imposing pressure. As he passed, no one dared speak. All the guests were as silent as cicadas in winter.This was Li Tianhan! He was a famous, valiant figure within Guangling City.A handsome youth in luxurious robes, a scabbard at his waist, followed him. His features bore a distinct resemblance to Li Tianhan\u2019s.Li Moyun!He was Li\u00a0Tianhan\u2019s\u00a0eldest son, as well as an inner sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s East Court. He was a prominent figure among Guangling City\u2019s younger generation.\u201cWhen did he get back?\u201d Wen Shaobei and the other youths\u2019 expressions changed dramatically.To the youths of Guangling City, Li\u00a0Moyun\u00a0was like a tall mountain. The pressure he put on them left them unable to even lift their heads. He was simply in a league of his own.Although Wen Changjing\u2019s son, Wen Jueyuan, was outstanding too, his reputation was somewhat inferior by comparison.\u201cBrother Li, you honor us with your presence. Forgive us for not welcoming you at the gate.\u201d Wen Changjing was startled into action, and he went up to welcome their new guest. However, his expression was visibly cold and distant, without any of the warmth he used to greet Huang Yunchong.\u201cToday is the matriarch\u2019s birthday, and the Wen Family is surrounded by such distinguished guests. How could I miss such an event?\u201d said Li Tianhan flatly. \u201cOh, I see. I came uninvited, but I trust Brother Wen won\u2019t take offense?Wen Changjing replied expressionlessly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare. You\u2019re here, and that makes you our guest. Please, join us in the clan hall.\u201dLi Tianhan nodded, but before he went any further, Li Moyun suddenly spoke up. \u201cFather, please wait a moment.\u201dThen, as the crowd watched, he walked right up to one of the tables, stopping next to Su Yi. \u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Su, long time no see.\u201dHe had an air of playful superiority as he gazed down at Su Yi.\u201cDo you have business with me?\u201d Su Yi asked casually. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to stand up.During his time at Blueriver Sword Manor, he\u2019d been the Sword Chief of the outer sect, while Li Moyun was already a disciple of the inner sect\u2019s East Court. He was superior to Su Yi in every way, from his backing and position to his cultivation.However, they hadn\u2019t interacted much at all during their time at Blueriver Sword Manor.Li Moyun stared intently at Su Yi for a moment, then said seriously, \u201cI just wanted to tell you something: someone like you is in no way worthy of Lingzhao!\u201dWith that, he turned and took up his position at his father\u2019s side. Then, father and son strode into the clan hall.From beginning to end, he didn\u2019t spare Su Yi so much as a second glance. In doing so, he inadvertently revealed the full extent of his cold indifference, pride, and disdain.The expressions of the nearby guests grew strange.Today, Su Yi had drawn far too much attention!First, it was Huang Yunchong. Upon arrival, the head of the Huang Family immediately took the initiative to greet Su Yi.Then, there was Li Moyun, a leading figure of his generation. He\u2019d gone up to Su Yi, unprovoked. Then, without any reservations whatsoever, he told him he was unworthy of Wen Lingzhao!Either incident on its own was more than enough to draw attention.Of course, whether this limelight was a good thing or not was up for debate. Either way, Su Yi didn\u2019t care in the least.He hadn\u2019t planned to participate in tonight\u2019s banquet at all. If not for his desire to meet with the Wen Family matriarch and ask about what happened last year, he would have left a long time ago.\u201cHow detestable that guy is!\u201d Wen Lingxue scowled.\u201cHe\u2019s most likely here for the same reason as Wei Zhengyang,\u201d said Su Yi indifferently. \u201cHe\u2019s got his sights set on your sister.\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026 Brother Su, your foresight is as keen as a prophet\u2019s!\u201d Huang Qianjun, who\u2019d been sitting there meekly all this time, added tentatively, \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, Li\u00a0Moyun\u00a0has been infatuated with Miss Lingzhao for years, and he\u2019s stated on more than one occasion that he\u2019d marry her or no one at all\u2026.\u201dAs he spoke, he snuck a furtive glance at Su Yi\u2019s expression. When he saw that Su Yi wasn\u2019t angry, he continued with renewed courage. \u201cBut how could he possibly compare to you, Brother Su? For what he said just now, he deserves a hard slap right in the face!\u201dSu Yi smiled faintly. \u201cAre you trying to encourage me to go deal with him?\u201dHuang Qianjun froze from head to toe, then broke out in cold sweats. He hurriedly waved his hands. \u201cPlease, Brother Su, don\u2019t misunderstand. His insults were over the line, and it made me angry, that\u2019s all!\u201dAfter witnessing Su Yi\u2019s methods in the Immortal Gathering House yesterday, he felt both awe and terror before Su Yi. He was like a mouse who\u2019d seen a cat\u2014no, he was even worse off. He naturally wouldn\u2019t dare try any funny business!Su Yi said nothing, but inwardly, he felt rather strange.Both Wei Zhengyang and Li Moyun harbored one-sided interest in Wen Lingzhao. This only highlighted just how extraordinarily charming she was.But at the same time, Su Yi caught a whiff of latent danger. What if one of the two of them made him wear a \u201cgreen hat\u201d? How could he bear such a thing?He and Wen Lingzhao might be husband and wife in name only, but it still counted!Su Yi had reincarnated to cultivate anew. He certainly didn\u2019t wish to bear the title \u201ccuckold\u201d in his new life.I\u2019ll have to find a chance to break things off with Wen LIngzhao completely. That way, I won\u2019t have to worry about that sort of thing happening\u2026.\u00a0Su Yi thought to himself.\u00a0But first, I\u2019ll have to disabuse Wei Zhengyang and Li Moyun of their ideas. If nothing else works, I can always just kill them and be done with it!Meanwhile, within the clan hall.After presenting his birthday gift, Li Tianhan\u2019s gaze swept around his surroundings before finally landing on Wen Changjing. \u201cIn addition to offering my congratulations, I have two other reasons for coming here today.\u201dWhen they heard this, every VIP\u2019s expression seemed to say \u201cI knew it!\u201d They\u2019d long since guessed that Li Tianhan had some other purpose for coming here.Wen Changjing instantly went on guard, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cBrother Li, whatever it is, can\u2019t it wait until after the banquet? Besides, more distinguished guests will be arriving soon, and I\u2019m afraid I have no time to discuss such matters.\u201dLi Tianhan immediately let out a carefree laugh. \u201cDistinguished guests? In the Wen Family\u2019s current state? Brother Wen, don\u2019t tell me you still think the city lord is going to pay a visit in person? To the best of my knowledge, Wen Changqing has made numerous visits to his manor over the past few days, only to be refused at the door!\u201dHis words revealed faint traces of disdain and mockery.The great hall\u2019s atmosphere instantly came to complete standstill. The tension was palpable.By now, even the dullest among them could tell that Li Tianhan had come with ill intentions!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - A Cold Glance, Disappearing Like a Puff of SmokeWen Changjing\u2019s expression instantly darkened.Today was the matriarch\u2019s eightieth birthday, and guests had come from far and wide. People were paying attention to what happened here, both in and out of Guangling City.Anything that happened at an event like this would spread to the outside world almost immediately.Although, on the surface, Li Tianhan was here to offer his congratulations, he was actually here with ill intentions!The family matriarch, Second Elder Wen Changqing, and the other family higher-ups all sensed that this wasn\u2019t going well, and each wore a more unsightly expression than the last.Li Tianhan seemed pleased with this result. He said flatly, \u201cRelax, everyone. Once I resolve these two petty trifles, I\u2019ll be on my way. I certainly won\u2019t do anything to disrupt the festivities.\u201d\u201dThen, without giving Wen Changjing or the others any chance to respond, he continued, \u201cFirst, I\u2019ve been saying lately that with the Wen Family\u2019s current foundations, it\u2019s no longer powerful enough to monopolize Guangling City\u2019s medicinal herb business. Today, you must give up half your shares!\u201d\u201cHalf? Li Tianhan, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve gone mad!\u201d The veins\u00a0bulged\u00a0on Wen Changjing\u2019s forehead. He was so mad, he practically jumped.The Wen Family higher-ups\u2019 anger was already written in their faces. The family\u2019s primary source of income was the medicinal herb trade; it was the foundation upon which they built their clan.Li Tianhan\u2019s demands were exorbitant; he wanted to take over half their business in one fell swoop! He was practically demanding their very lives!The guests in attendance sucked in breaths of cold air, and their hearts shook.\u00a0The Li Family sure is ruthless!Li Tianhan said flatly, \u201cBrother Li, you\u2019ve misunderstood something. Brother Huang and I discussed this matter earlier. The Wen Family is to give up half of their shares in total, but the Li Family will only take thirty percent, while the Huang Family will take over the remaining twenty. If you refuse, well, don\u2019t blame us for our poor manners.\u201dThe crowd was dazed, but more than that, terror rose unbidden in their hearts. They\u2019d just realized that Li Tianhan was using the combined power of the Li and Huang Families to force the Wen Family to lower its head!In a situation like this, if the Wen Family refused, they were in for endless trouble.After all, with their current base of power, there was no way they could resist both families at once.Wen Changjing, Wen Changqing and the others were obviously well aware of this. Their hearts sank, and they felt helpless.\u201cBrother Huang is here too. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask him directly.\u201d As Li Tianhan spoke, he glanced toward the nearby Huang Yunchong.\u201cBrother Huang, is this true?\u201d asked Wen Changjing in a low voice.Those seated all glanced towards Huang Yunchong, only to see his expression undergo a series of rapid transformations. In the end, he seemed to make up his mind.He shot to his feet and said gravely, \u201cIt\u2019s not! Don\u2019t talk nonsense! Nothing like that ever happened!\u201dHe refuted it three times in a row.The guests were stunned, and at a bit of a loss.\u00a0This\u2026 What exactly is going on?Meanwhile, Wen Changjing and company lit up with delight.\u00a0It seems Li Tianhan and Huang Yunchong haven\u2019t formed an alliance after all!\u201cBrother Huang, what\u2019s the meaning of this? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten the agreement we reached earlier!\u201d Li Tianhan\u2019s expression shifted; he\u2019d clearly been caught off guard.\u201cWhat promise? That was just a joke! How was I supposed to know you\u2019d take it seriously?\u201d Huang Yunchong took a deep breath, then said expressionlessly, \u201cBrother Li, I\u2019d like to remind you of something: this is the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet! You\u2019d best restrain yourself a little!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Li Tianhan\u2019s expression darkened.However, he\u2019d experienced countless ups and downs in his life, and his keen intuition told him that something unusual was going on.\u00a0That blasted geezer Huang Yunchong! To think he\u2019d turn on me at this critical juncture! Could it be that something unexpected has happened and he no longer dares to get involved?\u201cBrother Li, is there anything else you\u2019d like to say?\u201d Wen Changjing snorted, but inwardly, he felt much calmer. Without the Huang Family\u2019s participation, the Wen Family would only have to face the Li Family. In that case, he still had a bit of confidence.Li Tianhan quickly got his emotions under control, then said expressionlessly, \u201cForget it. Let\u2019s set that aside for now and move onto the second matter.\u201dThose seated in the clan hall felt their hearts clench. The first matter was already enough to make the atmosphere so hostile, fighting might break out at any moment. Just how terrifying would the second matter be?Then, to their surprise, Li Tianhan turned to his son. \u201cMoyun, you say it.\u201dLi Moyun stepped forth, looked around, then spoke in a loud and clear voice, \u201cI heard that Su Yi and Lingzhao are husband and wife in name only, and furthermore, that Lingzhao loathes Su Yi to the core of her being. Thus, I hope the elders of the Wen Family can annul their wedding contract and return Lingzhao her freedom!\u201dA single falling stone could give rise to a thousand waves. Just like that, the entire room was in uproar.Wen Changjing, Wen Changqing, and the other family higher-ups were beside themselves with astonishment.Who would have guessed that the second matter Li Tianhan had come to discuss was Su Yi\u2019s marriage?\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Wen Changtai and Qin Qing looked at each other, baffled. And yet, they had a sense of deja vu.Why? Because just seven days ago, Wei Zhengyang of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2019s Wei Family had said almost exactly the same thing! He, too, had come here for their daughter!It was just\u2026. They never in a million years would have anticipated that their daughter would be in such high demand even after getting married\u2026.At the same time, outside the clan hall.As Li Moyun made this proclamation, countless strange and mocking gazes landed on Su Yi.The conversations within the clan hall were audible outside, and the nearby guests heard everything going on. They too were incomparably shocked. None of them had guessed Li Moyun would make such a request!Many of those present predicted that Su Yi, the live-in son-in-law, would be ousted from the Wen Family that very night!After all, the head of the Li Family had come in person. Why would the Wen Family make trouble with the Li Family over a petty matter like this?\u201cDetestable!\u201d Wen Lingxue\u2019s almond-shaped eyes bulged with anger.Huang Qianjun merely laughed coldly. There was even a hint of delight of schadenfreude in his gaze. \u201cThis guy\u2019s looking to get himself killed!\u201dFeigning casualness, he glanced at Su Yi and saw that his brows had faintly knit together. This told Huang Qianjun that they were in for a good show!\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Wen Changjing, Wen Changqing, and the rest of the higher-ups hesitated. All of them looked toward the Wen Family matriarch.It was she who single-handedly decided Su Yi and Wen Lingzhao\u2019s marriage, without the least regard for the family\u2019s objections.Otherwise, Wen Changjing and the others would have kicked Su Yi out a long time ago!The elderly matriarch sensed their gazes, and realized it was time for her to make her position clear. She took a deep breath, then said emphatically, \u201cThis marriage contract cannot be annulled, no matter who shows up!\u201dA firm refusal with no room for negotiation!The Wen Family higher-ups\u2019 hearts sank, and all of them were confused. They didn\u2019t understand why even now, the matriarch insisted on maintaining this marriage.Qin Qing was even a little frantic; she\u2019d opposed this marriage right from the start. Who knew how many times she\u2019d longed to kick Su Yi right out the door?This was undoubtedly a perfect opportunity to do just that!Yet the matriarch just\u00a0had\u00a0to go and refuse!Li Moyun furrowed his brow in deep displeasure. His gaze turned towards his father, Li Tianhan.However, before Li Tianhan could speak, Huang Yunchong let out a long sigh.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re an outsider, yet you\u2019re trying to extend your reach into someone else\u2019s marriage? Moyun, my worthy nephew, please allow this old man to give you a warning: change course as soon as possible!\u201dLi\u00a0Tianhan\u2019s\u00a0pupils constricted. \u201cBrother Huang, what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cWhat do I mean?\u201d Huang Yunchong\u2019s gaze swept across the crowd. Finally, he said in a low voice, \u201cAlright, allow me to make myself clear: have your son give up on Wen Lingzhao. Otherwise, disaster is imminent!\u201dLi Tianhan\u2019s expression shifted.The others in attendance were at a loss; this was between the Li and Wen Families. Why would Huang Yunchong, the head of the Huang Family, get mixed up in all this?It was naturally difficult for them to understand.Li Moyun was displeased, and a sinister look surfaced on his handsome face. \u201cUncle Huang, surely you don\u2019t think I\u2019m inferior to Su Yi of all people?\u201dHuang Yunchong\u2019s eyes filled with pity, and he shook his head. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing now is known as \u2018inviting your own humiliation.\u2019\u201dInviting your own humiliation!Four simple words, but they left the crowd in a daze. They almost wondered if their ears were playing tricks on them.Just how lofty was Li Moyun? He was the leading figure of Guangling City\u2019s younger generation, an inner sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor. With a status like that, how could he possibly be inferior to a waste like Su Yi, a cripple who\u2019d lost his entire cultivation?\u201cBrother Huang, you seem to have become a different person overnight. You\u2019re not just standing in my way at every turn, you\u2019re even interfering in my son\u2019s business!\u201d Li Tianhan\u2019s eyes frosted over, and he was inwardly seething.He\u2019d come here to make trouble for the Wen Family. He never would have guessed Huang Yunchong would ruin his attempts repeatedly!Just as Huang Yunchong was about to say something, a low voice emanated from outside the great hall.\u201cBrother Huang is right. Some mistakes, once made, are no different from setting oneself on fire!\u201dAs these words echoed throughout the hall, the tall and stalwart figure of the captain of the city lord\u2019s Old Guard, Nie Beihu, strode inside.The entire venue was stunned, and the guests were bewildered. They couldn\u2019t see through what was happening.Wen Changjing and the rest of the higher-ups felt the same way; they never would have guessed that the captain of the Old Guard, Nie Beihu, would show up of his own accord.Even stranger, Nie Beihu had only just arrived, but he\u2019d already pointed the tip of his proverbial spear right at Li Tianhan and his son!\u201cNie Beihu, what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Li Tianhan had clearly been caught off guard, and his expression instantly darkened. He could tell that something strange was going on today.Huang Yunchong\u2019s behavior had been out of character, and although Nie Beihu had only just arrived, he was acting strange too!In the past, how could either of them have dared treat him like this?But before Li Tianhan could react, yet another voice resounded from beyond the great hall.\u201cCommander Nie is saying that this is the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday. You and your son had best leave as soon as possible so as not to disrupt the festivities!\u201dThe tables outside the great hall were in uproar. An endless series of exclamations rang out.Shortly after, beneath everyone\u2019s disbelieving gazes, a middle-aged man in loose-sleeved Confucian robes strode into the great hall.\u201cCity Lord Fu!\u201d When Wen Changjing realized who this new arrival was, he was overjoyed, and he hurriedly stepped forward to greet the city lord. \u201cGreetings, City Lord Fu.\u201d\u201cCity Lord Fu is here too?\u201d Everyone in attendance was stunned. Every last distinguished guest rose with reverence and awe, then greeted the city lord with a smile.This new arrival was none other than Fu Shan, the lord of Guangling City!\u201cCity Lord Fu\u2026. You\u2026. What are you doing here?\u201d Li Tianhan was dazed, and he\u2019d completely lost his cool. Tidal waves surged through his heart.He\u2019d long since heard that Fu Shan had no intentions of making an appearance at the banquet whatsoever. Who would have guessed that Fu Shan would show up at this critical juncture?\u201cI\u2019m naturally here to wish the Wen Family matriarch a happy birthday,\u201d said Fu Shan calmly. As he spoke, he took a jewelry box from his sleeves and passed it to the matriarch with a smile. \u201cThis is a token of my good intentions.\u201dThe matriarch broke into an uncontrollable smile, then thanked him repeatedly.Only then did Fu Shan turn and look at Li Tianhan, his expression cold. \u201cBrother Li, I made myself perfectly clear. I suggest you don\u2019t stubbornly continue down the wrong path. You and your son had best leave as soon as possible.\u201dLi\u00a0Tianhan\u2019s\u00a0expression froze in place.His gaze landed, first on Huang Yunchong, and then on Nie Beihu and Fu Shan. He seemed to have understood something, and his expression shifted continuously. An indescribable iciness coursed through him, and he sank into a lengthy silence.Finally, Li Tianhan cupped his fist. \u201cSorry to have bothered you. I\u2019ll be taking my leave now!\u201dWith that, he grabbed Li Moyun by the elbow and dragged him off without so much as a second glance.The group gathered in the clan\u00a0hall watched\u00a0their departure. All of them felt restless and agitated; they couldn\u2019t calm down.Everyone could see that the esteemed head of the Li Family had tripped and fallen on his face today!He\u2019d come smug and complacent, only to leave crestfallen and disgraced!As for the guests outside the clan hall, they witnessed Li Tianhan and son\u2019s pathetic departure with their own eyes. Wen Lingxue seemed dazed.\u00a0This\u2026 What exactly is happening?Huang Qianjun, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t help but snicker. Look at yourself! What can you call that but \u2018inviting your own humiliation\u2019?What about Su Yi? His expression was as calm as ever. He picked up the wine vessel and poured himself another glass, then leisurely drained it. From beginning to end, he remained detached from the situation.Just like that, the waves Li Tianhan and son stirred up vanished as if in a puff of smoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - The Matriarch Extends an InvitationWhen Nie Beihu and Fu Shan made their appearance, Huang Qianjun realized that the true spectacle had just begun.As expected, just a few moments had passed since their arrival, yet Li Tianhan and son had already slunk off in disgrace!Furthermore, the way those in the surrounding area looked at Su Yi had changed. When he saw this, Huang Qianjun was inwardly gleeful.This was because, of those outside the clan hall, only he had anticipated this result!Father was right. Su Yi hides himself deeply, and you can\u2019t judge him with common sense. Otherwise, given the connections he revealed at the Immortal Gathering House yesterday, there\u2019s no way he\u2019d have to remain at the Wen Family as a disdained live-in son-in-law.After returning from the Immortal Gathering House, he and his father had talked well into the night.In the end, father and son reached the same conclusion\u2014There had to be some secret behind Su Yi\u2019s choice to remain in the Wen Family despite his immense capabilities!That was why Huang Qianjun and his father, despite coming in person, didn\u2019t go out of their way to initiate small talk with Su Yi. They feared that if they caused too much of a commotion, they\u2019d inadvertently reveal Su Yi\u2019s secrets.That was why they gave the Nine-Leafed King Ginseng to Wen Changtai and his wife and asked them to pass it on to Su Yi and his wife later.Wen Lingzhao was just a convenient pretense. They needed some ostensible reason for their gift, after all.What Huang Qianjun realized, Nie Beihu and Fu Shan had obviously picked up on as well. They all sensed that Su Yi didn\u2019t want to reveal certain matters, which was why they tacitly agreed to \u201cput on a show.\u201dI\u2019m afraid no one in the Wen Family will guess or even consider that me, my dad, and even Nie Beihu and Fu Shan, are all here as a show of respect for Su Yi\u2026. Haha, this is way too much fun!\u00a0Huang Qianjun laughed to himself.Su Yi would never have guessed that this domineering youth was enjoying this game so thoroughly. Had he known, he would surely have laughed.Naturally, he realized that all of four of them, Huang Yunchong and son, as well as Fu Shan and Nie Beihu,\u00a0were\u00a0here because of him.No, that\u2019s not it. They\u2019re here as a show of respect for Old Man Xiao and Zi Jin,\u00a0he thought to himself.With the experience and mental state of his past life, there was no way he\u2019d get complacent over this. Besides, he disdained relying on others\u2019 power to resolve his personal problems.He hadn't asked the four of them to show up. They\u2019d all taken it upon themselves.Back in the great hall.After Li Tianhan and son left, the tense atmosphere mellowed significantly.Wen Changjing was nothing but smiles as he warmly welcomed Fu Shan and Nie Beihu to sit down. Both were prominent figures, and today, they\u2019d become the Wen Family\u2019s pillar of support, helping them head off a potential disaster!\u201cI\u2019m here for another purpose, so I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to abstain from the banquet,\u201d said Fu Shan with a wave. Then, he turned and walked up to Wen Changtai\u2019s table with a smile. \u201cA certain distinguished figure requested that I deliver this gift on their behalf. Please, pass this onto Su Yi and his wife.\u201dAs he spoke, he solemnly retrieved a fist-sized, brocade box, then passed it over. \u201cRemember, only Su Yi and his wife are to open it.\u201dWen Changtai and Qin Qing leaped to their feet as if they\u2019d been electrocuted, practically knocking the table over. They never would have guessed that someone as lofty as the city lord would personally give their family a gift!The others were stunned too. They looked at each other.Family Head Huang Yunchong had just personally delivered Wen Changtai and his family those pieces of \u201cNine-Leafed King Ginseng.\u201d That alone came as an enormous surprise.Yet now the city lord was doing the same thing?Wen Changjing and the other higher-ups\u00a0stared\u00a0in wide-eyed astonishment.\u00a0What exactly is going on today?Why is Ol\u2019 Three\u2019s family so popular all of a sudden?\u201cThank\u2026. Thank you, City Lord!\u201d Wen Changtai was so excited, he could barely control himself, and his voice trembled as he spoke..Qin Qing beamed. Years of accumulated grievances and dejection seemed to melt away, as if they\u2019d finally found release.She took a deep breath, then smiled broadly and bowed with the utmost respect. \u201cCity Lord Fu, please allow me to thank you for your generosity on behalf of my daughter and son-in-law!\u201dHer gaze swept across the great hall, and she took in the crowd\u2019s stunned expressions. She felt nothing but pride and satisfaction, and despite herself, the corners of her lips tugged upward.\u00a0My day has finally come!\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me,\u201d said Fu Shan. \u201cThis is a gift from a person of eminence. I\u2019m merely delivering it on their behalf.\u201d\u201cMight I ask who that eminent figure might be?\u201d asked Qin Qing curiously.The crowd\u2019s ears pricked up. Anyone capable of giving City Lord Fu Shan orders was surely extraordinary!Huang Yunchong seemed to understand, and his heart shook. A certain title floated into his sea of consciousness\u2014The Spiritjade Marchioness!However, Fu Shan merely smiled and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it's not my place to disclose their identity. Please, forgive me if I don\u2019t answer your questions. All you need to know is that this gift is intended for Su Yi and his wife.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pass it onto them personally,\u201d said Qin Qing hurriedly.The crowd\u2019s expressions shifted subtly. Fu Shan had repeatedly emphasized that this gift was for \u201cSu Yi and his wife.\u201d This undoubtedly had profound implications!Lingzhao is now a disciple of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. Could that be why?\u00a0Wen Changjing and the other Wen Family higher-ups looked at each other. They all subconsciously assumed that this gift had to have something to do with Wen Lingzhao.None of them even considered the possibility that it might have something to do with Su Yi.\u201cCommander Nie, please remain here and enjoy the feast on my behalf. I have other matters to attend to, so I\u2019ll bid you all farewell for now.\u201d Fu Shan turned, gave Nie Beihu his orders, then left.Wen Changjing and the others hurriedly saw him to the gate.On his way out of the clan hall, Fu Shan paused as he passed Su Yi\u2019s table. He said with an amiable smile, \u201cYoung Lord Su, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dSu Yi nodded.Everyone witnessed this exchange, and despite their immense shock, they all assumed that Su Yi was riding on Wen Lingzhao\u2019s coattails. That had to be why Fu Shan was giving him special treatment.After Fu Shan\u2019s group disappeared, Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but whisper, \u201cBrother Su, you\u2019re the most respected person here!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me?\u201d asked Su Yi casually.Huang Qianjun froze, then looked ashamed. He said sheepishly, \u201cLast night, my father taught me a lesson. He made me fully realize just how enormous the gap between us is\u2026. I\u2026. I feel nothing but awe and delight at my good fortune. I in no way carry a grudge.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cI hope you really mean that.\u201dWen Lingxue heard their entire conversation, and she felt increasingly confused.\u00a0This entire series of events has been altogether too strange, hasn\u2019t it\u2026.?Although Fu Shan only made a brief appearance, he\u2019d had an enormous impact.The atmosphere within the clan\u2019s great hall regained its earlier liveliness, and many of the guests rose and toasted Wen Changtai and wife of their own volition.Wen Changtai was a simple man, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew what was going on, and he was delighted.Qin Qing was in even higher spirits. Her eyes sparkled with exultant joy. Although she wanted to hide her joy, she just couldn\u2019t control herself\u2026.Wen Changjing and the other family higher-ups were happy too. Li Tianhan and son had left in dejection, and the Wen Family had averted a potential crisis.Even better, with Fu Shan and Nie Beihu\u2019s show of support, the guests\u2019 attitudes had shifted subtly.This was undoubtedly wonderful news for Wen Changjing and the declining Wen Family!\u201cSo, Brother Huang, you\u2019ve completely changed your attitude?\u201d Nie Beihu sat beside Huang Yunchong and asked unobtrusively.\u201cYesterday, I was blind and foolish. I was wrong to target Young Lord Su. Why hold a grudge over my mistake?\u201d Huang Yunchong laughed heartily. \u201cI really ought to thank him for showing mercy and allowing my son and I to\u00a0avoid greater\u00a0disaster. I\u2019m deeply grateful, which is why I decided to pay a personal visit, first to congratulate the Wen Family matriarch, and second to offer a humble apology gift as an expression of my penitence.\u201dNie Beihu was stunned for a moment. Then, he took a deep look at Huang Yunchong. \u201cI suspect you have other reasons you left unsaid.\u201dHuang Yunchong\u2019s eyebrows shifted slightly. \u201cCare to enlighten me?\u201dNie Beihu glanced outside the clan hall, and his gaze landed on Huang Qianjun, who was seated beside Su Yi.\u201cI suspect you\u2019ve already realized that with Young Lord Su\u2019s connections, his future is limitless,\u201d said Nie Beihu, his voice full of profound implications. \u201cThus, you\u2019ve decided to treat yesterday\u2019s incident as a turning point, using penitence and compensation to build a connection with Young Lord Su. Am I right?\u201dHuang Yunchong\u2019s gaze shifted, turning serious. Then, he laughed, \u201cWhen parents love their children, they make long-term plans for their futures. That\u2019s true for me, but isn\u2019t it true for you too?\u201dNie Beihu raised his wineglass and laughed. \u201cCome on then, let\u2019s drink together!\u201dMeanwhile, the Wen Family matriarch had watched all of this play out from the seat of honor. Complex emotions filled her heart.Today was her eightieth birthday.Far too much had happened at her celebratory feast.She was well aware that the Wen Family had only avoided disaster by borrowing others\u2019 momentum.If they weren\u2019t strong enough in their own right, the Wen Family\u2019s illusion of prosperity would be short-lived!As she considered this, the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s gaze passed over the guests of the great hall and landed on someone seated outside.He was a lean youth in blue cloth robes, seated casually with a transcendent air about him, out of sync with the crowd.She took a deep breath, then looked away and turned to the servant girl beside her. \u201cCall\u00a0Ol\u2019\u00a0Three\u2019s wife over.\u201dThe servant rushed off to do as she was told.Shortly after, Qin Qing arrived in a hurry. She asked in confusion, \u201cMatriarch, do you have business with me?\u201dThe Wen Family matriarch stared at her gravely. \u201cYou are not to keep the gifts City Lord Fu and Family Head Huang gave you for yourself. Give them to Su Yi as soon as the banquet is over.\u201dQin Qing\u2019s expression shifted, and she forced a smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for concern. I wouldn\u2019t covet such things. It\u2019s just\u2026 These gifts are intended for my daughter and my son-in-law. Giving them to just Su Yi\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking better than anyone,\u201d said the matriarch with a cold laugh. \u201cOrdinarily, I wouldn\u2019t bother getting involved, but today\u2019s matter is different. You\u2019d best do as I tell you!\u201dQin Qing froze. She really had intended to keep both gifts for herself, but now that the matriarch had given such a command, she dispelled that idea and lowered her head. \u201cYes.\u201dAfter sending Qin Qing on her way, the matriarch rose and turned to the servant beside her. \u201cNow go tell Su Yi to come see me in the Floral Tea House.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dOutside the great hall.When he heard why the servant girl had come, a flash of unusual light shone in the depths of Su Yi\u2019s gaze.\u00a0It seems the old woman can\u2019t restrain herself any longer.That\u2019s fine too.\u00a0After all, I only came to the banquet because I wanted to ask her about what happened back then.Su Yi drained his glass, then rose leisurely. \u201cLead the way.\u201dWith that, he followed the serving girl into the Floral Tea House.Seth's ThoughtsAs a foreigner living outside of China, I'm not sure to what extent this happens/happened in real life. Probably not so much nowadays due to smaller family sizes...? In novels, at least, it's common for families with multiple children to refer to them by their number. Same applies to siblings, aunts, uncles, etc. Thus, if it's not already clear, Ol' Three is the matriarch's way of referring to her third son, Wen Changtai, and the family head/second elder's way of referring to their younger brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Past Enmities, a Heart\u2019s ObsessionWhen Su Yi arrived at the Floral Tea House, only the Wen Family matriarch was seated there.At eighty years of age, she was old and grey, but she was hale and hearty, and she carried herself with the air of one long in power.\u201cThird Young Master, there is no one here besides you and I, so there\u2019s no need to bow.\u201d She pointed to the chair beside her and said coldly, \u201cSit down.\u201dThird Young Master!When Su Yi heard this title, he looked a bit disoriented.His current body was the son of the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family. He was his father\u2019s third child, with an older brother and sister, as well as a younger brother.However, as he was born of a concubine, and because his mother, Ye Yufei, had died young, he\u2019d been neglected and overlooked from a young age. His status was inferior to even the family stewards.\u201cMatriarch, might I ask what you\u2019ve called me here for?\u201d Su Yi inwardly shook his head, then sat casually. He seemed perfectly at ease.Throughout the Wen Family, only he knew that the family matriarch, Liang Wenbi, had once been a servant girl of the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family.\u00a0She\u2019d served\u00a0at Family Head Su Hongli\u2019s side for a full thirty years.And in this new lifetime, Su Hongli was none other than Su Yi\u2019s father!\u201cYou want to know what I called you for?\u201d said the elderly matriarch coldly. \u201cThird Young Master, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten everything that happened during the birthday feast? Others might assume that Fu Shan, Nie Beihu, and Huang Yunchong came here on account of Lingzhao, but I certainly won\u2019t!\u201cNow then, Third Young Master, I have only one question. Is there something you ought to explain to me?\u201d Her words were forceful and overbearing; she was stern in both voice and countenance.If this were the past Su Yi, her powerful presence might very well have intimidated him by now.But why would the current Su Yi fear an old lady like her?Still, Su Yi had something he wished to ask her, so he wouldn\u2019t get hung up on that.\u201cUnless my deductions are mistaken, they indeed came here on my account,\u201d he said, as casually as if he were talking about the weather.Slam!The Wen Family matriarch slammed her fists against the armrests in obvious fury. Her wrinkled face was overcast and terrifying.\u201cThird Young Master,\u201d she said harshly, \u201cDo you remember the message your father had me pass onto you a year ago, upon your marriage into the Wen Family?\u201dBefore Su Yi could respond, she answered her own question, pausing for emphasis between each word. \u201cIf you dare use the Su Family\u2019s name to your own ends, immediate execution!\u2019\u201c\u2018If you dare take even half a step into the Jade Capital, immediate execution!\u2019\u201dThe atmosphere was instantly incomparably oppressive.Su Yi\u2019s father, Su Hongli, had indeed said those very murderous, cold, heartless words.This was why, although it had been a year since his marriage into the Wen Family, only the matriarch knew of his origins. Nevermind the people of Guangling City; even the rest of the family was in the dark.\u201cMatriarch, it seems you\u2019ve assumed that I used my position as the Su Family\u2019s third young master to convince Fu Shan and the others to make an appearance today?\u201d Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but laugh.The matriarch\u2019s brows knit together, and her expression grew even frostier. \u201cAre you telling me you didn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cIf you want to know the truth, you\u2019re welcome to go ask Fu Shan and the others yourself. With the power at your disposal, investigating a trivial matter like that shouldn\u2019t be the least bit difficult,\u201d Su Yi said casually. \u201cBut what I can tell you is this: I, Su Yi, won\u2019t use the Su Family\u2019s name to my advantage now, nor\u2026 will I ever do so in the future!\u201dHis expression was calm, but there was a hint of contempt in the depths of his gaze.What need did the illustrious Swordmaster of Abstruse Force have for such empty titles?The Wen Family matriarch was visibly startled, and she couldn\u2019t help but reevaluate Su Yi. An indescribable sense of unfamiliarity coursed through her.This seemed like an altogether different person from the Third Young Master she was familiar with.After a moment\u2019s silence, she said, \u201cI will naturally get to the bottom of this!\u201dSu Yi smiled, but made no further attempts to explain himself.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m as of yet uncertain why Fu Shan and Nie Beihu attach such importance to you, I must remind you that in the eyes of the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family, figures on their level are no different from ants! The Su Yi family wouldn\u2019t even need to take action themselves; one sentence, and they\u2019d both perish without so much as a proper burial!\u201dThe Wen Family matriarch\u2019s expression was cold and indifferent, but when she spoke of the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family, she unwittingly revealed a hint of pride.\u201cWith that in mind, I urge you to behave yourself! Or else, you\u2019ll bring calamity upon everyone connected to you!\u201dSu Yi thought back to his time in the Jade Capital, in the Su Family estate. He had to admit that the Wen Family matriarch wasn\u2019t exaggerating in the least.Yujing, the Jade Capital, was the imperial capital of the Great Zhou.And the Su Family was one of the Jade Capital\u2019s four peak-level clans!By comparison, Guangling City was just one of Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s nineteen cities. The likes of Fu Shan and Nie Beihu really were beneath the Su Family\u2019s notice.They were as far removed as heaven and earth!It was just a pity that, although the Wen Family matriarch didn\u2019t know it, Su Yi had never had any intentions of relying on anyone else\u2019s power to conduct his affairs!In his eyes, even the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family was just a paltry little faction of the mundane world. He at least didn\u2019t see much of a difference between them and Fu Shan.\u201cIt\u2019s true that Fu Shan pales in comparison to the Su Family, but at the banquet, we needed him to maintain appearances,\u201d said Su Yi flatly. \u201cMatriarch, it seems that you\u2019re unlikely to receive aid from the Su Family ever again.\u201dOne sentence, and he hit her right where it hurt the most. Her expression instantly turned unsightly.Seeing this, Su Yi felt no need to elaborate.The Wen Family matriarch had only been one of the Su Family\u2019s servants. Add that to the fact that she hadn\u2019t served them in a long time, and why would the Su Family concern themselves over someone like her?She took a deep breath, then sneered. \u201cI never would have guessed that within just one year of marriage, the Third Young Master\u2019s mouth would become so sharp.\u201dSu Yi could tell that it was her shame that provoked this outburst. He ignored it and smiled, \u201cMatriarch, everyone changes over time. That aside, I came here because I too had something I wished to ask you.\u201dHer brows furrowed. \u201cSomething to do with the Su Family?\u201dHe nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I want to know just whose idea it was to have me marry into the Wen Family.\u201dThe Wen Family matriarch fell silent for a moment, then said, \u201cIt was the fourth lady of the house who suggested it, but your father who made the final decision.\u201d\u201cYou Qingzhi?\u201d A cold glint flashed through Su Yi\u2019s eyes.The \u201cfourth lady of the house\u201d the matriarch referred to was his father\u2019s fourth wife. Her name was You Qingzhi.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The Wen Family matriarch nodded, not surprised that Su Yi would call her by name.Back then, everyone in the Su Family knew that the fourth lady of the house detested no one more than Su Yi, her husband\u2019s son with a concubine!\u201cGiven her personality, why not just kill and silence me as soon as I lost my cultivation? She ought to know full well the depths of my hatred for her. Unless she kills me, I\u2019ll always be a potential threat.\u201d Su Yi didn\u2019t quite understand.The matriarch couldn\u2019t help but laugh coldly, but when she looked at Su Yi, her eyes filled with pity. \u201cThird Young Master, your mother died young, and even your father sees you as nothing more than the unworthy son of a concubine. He\u2019s never cared about you. Now, having lost your cultivation on top of that, you\u2019re no different from a cripple. Do you really think yourself worthy of the title \u2018a potential threat\u2019?\u201dShe paused, then continued, \u201cBut no matter what, the blood of the Su Family flows through your veins. Were the fourth lady of the house to kill you, it would displease your father and turn him against her. The losses outweigh the potential gains. Someone as clever as her would never do something so foolish.\u201dSu Yi fell silent.Hearing it spelled out like this, his fate as the son of a concubine in the Su Family had been miserable indeed.At just four years old, his mother, Ye Yufei, fell gravely ill. In the end, she left this mortal coil.From that moment on, his plight had only worsened.His father, Su Hongli, wasn\u2019t the least bit fond of him, and he neither asked about nor took care of him.Throughout the entire Su Family, not a single person dared get close to him, leaving him isolated and alone.As he grew up and experienced more of the world, he started suspecting that his mother\u2019s illness wasn\u2019t natural, and moreover, that Su Hongli was behind it!This thought filled his heart with agony and hatred.Four years ago, he decided to leave and cultivate at Blueriver Sword Manor. His goal, to pursue the Martial Dao and become strong.Yet just three years later, reawakening the memories of his past life robbed him of his entire cultivation, and under the Su Family\u2019s forceful arrangements, he\u2019d become the Wen Family\u2019s live-in son-in-law\u2026.The me of the past seventeen years really lived an overly stifled life,\u00a0Su Yi lamented to himself.While combing through his memories, he discovered that his hatred of his father, Su Hongli, as well as his father\u2019s fourth wife, You Qingzhi, had already become his heart\u2019s obsession.It\u2019s naturally up to my current self to resolve this obsession.\u00a0Su Yi\u2019s gaze regained its usual calm.If he didn\u2019t overcome this, it would inevitably interfere with his future efforts to prove his Dao!\u201cRight, I recently heard news that that shook the entire Jade Capital.\u201d The Wen Family matriarch suddenly spoke up, her gaze playful. \u201cAlthough your younger brother, Su Boning, is only sixteen, he\u2019s recently become an expert of the Qi Accumulation Realm\u2019s \u2018Astral Manifestation\u2019 stage. He\u2019s now considered one of the \u2018the Jade Capital\u2019s Eight Geniuses.\u2019\u201cThe Great Zhou\u2019s imperial family as agreed that so long as he steps into the Inner Furnace realm and becomes a Grandmaster by the time he turns eighteen, they\u2019ll send him to the Great Zhou\u2019s number-one Holy Land, \u2018The Hidden Dragon Sword Sect\u2019, to continue his cultivation!\u201dSu Yi froze, and the image of a handsome youth in pristine white robes surfaced in his mind.Su Boning.His mother was You Qingzhi, and he was the youngest of Su Hongli\u2019s sons. Furthermore, within the Su Family\u2019s main line of descent, he was regarded as the most peerless genius of the Martial Dao!Although You Qingzhi was Su Hongli\u2019s fourth wife, she was still a proper wife, which meant Su Boning was part of the Su Family\u2019s main line.By comparison, Su Yi\u2019s mother, Ye Yufei, was just a concubine. That put him outside the main line of succession.In summary, although Su Yi was the older brother, his status in the Su Family wasn\u2019t even remotely comparable to Su Boning\u2019s in any way.An eighteen-year-old Martial Dao Grandmaster? They think that\u2019s an unparalleled genius?\u00a0Inwardly, Su Yi found it rather funny.He naturally could tell that the Wen Family matriarch brought this up to provoke him.But there was no way she\u2019d ever imagine that in his eyes, eighteen-year-old Martial Dao Grandmasters were a dime a dozen. At least in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, they were nothing to write home about.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d Su Yi decided to take this leave. He\u2019d confirmed some things already, and had no plans to linger here any longer.\u201cWait.\u201d The Wen Family matriarch called him back. \u201cBefore you go, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to show you.\u201dAs she spoke, she pulled a silver jade talisman from her sleeves and raised it for Su Yi to see. \u201cThird Young Master, do you know what this is?\u201dThis jade talisman was about three inches long and silver throughout. Although it looked like jade, it also seemed somehow not quite jade, and it emanated a faint glow.It immediately attracted Su Yi\u2019s attention.Seth's ThoughtsThis scene was one of the reasons I decided to differentiate between \"gongzi\" and \"shaoye\", even though both can be reasonably translated as young master. The matriarch is calling him \"young master\" specifically, and the difference is significant: it implies that she knows his background. \"Shaoye\" is not a generic term of respect; for her to use it means that his background is at least somewhat prominent, and that his background/father/status is worthy of her respect (regardless of whether she considers Su Yi worthy of respect).\"Third Young Master\" says that he's the third child, much like \"Ol' Three\" meant that Wen Changtai was the third son in his family.It's common to number boys and girls separately, but that doesn't seem to be the case here; Su Yi is the third child, but the second son.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Youthful Ignorance and ConceitSu Yi glanced at it. Despite himself, he was surprised. \u201cAn Origin Talisman?\u201d\u201cOrigin Talismans\u201d were something cultivators could craft only after stepping into the realm of the Origin Dao. They were full to the brim with origin power, and those who possessed them wielded unbelievable might.Within the Great Zhou\u2019s borders, those experts of the Origin Dao were known as Earthly Immortals.The treasures experts of that level produced were absolutely priceless, difficult to purchase even with a mountain of gold!\u201cThat\u2019s right. This talisman is called \u2018Star Cleaver\u2019. Your father gave it to me the day you married into the Wen Family. Once shattered, it can obliterate a Martial Dao Grandmaster in a single attack!\u201d The matriarch cautiously put it away, then straightened her back, obvious pride written on her face. \u201cThis treasure is our Wen Family\u2019s greatest assurance.\u201dSu Yi inwardly shook his head.\u00a0A single Origin Talisman, that\u2019s all. Is it really worth all that pride?\u201cMatriarch, might I ask what you\u2019re telling me this for?\u201d he asked.\u201cThird Young Master, in the year following your marriage into the Wen Family, aside from a few cold glances and barbed words, has anyone ever really hurt or bullied you?\u201d asked the matriarch.Su Yi shook his head. \u201cActually, no.\u201dThe matriarch continued sternly, her words carried a hint of a threat, \u201cThird Young Master, listen up. I don\u2019t care whether you hate the Wen Family or not, but if you dare do anything detrimental to our bottom line, I won\u2019t spare you!\u201dSu Yi finally understood.\u00a0Ah. She took that Origin Talisman out earlier to threaten me, that\u2019s all.He smiled. There was no need to linger here any longer, so he simply turned and left.\u201cWhy does it seem like that kid\u2019s an entirely different person now\u2026.?\u201d Only after he disappeared from the Floral Tea House did the elderly matriarch look away. Her brow was furrowed, and she looked uncertain. \u201cShould I write a letter to the Su Family and inform them of what happened today?\u201dA while later, she let out a lengthy sigh. She\u2019d made up her mind. \u201cForget it. As an outsider, it\u2019s not my place to get involved in the Su Family\u2019s business, and it hasn\u2019t been for a long time. So long as that brat doesn\u2019t do anything to hurt the Wen Family, I can look the other way!\u201d\u2026..The birthday feast was still ongoing, and the atmosphere was lively.When Su Yi returned, he saw Wen Shaobei and the other Wen Family youths all clustering around the same person.Even\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue was there.The one they\u2019d gathered around was Wen Jueyuan, Family Head Wen Changjing\u2019s son and an elite at the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm. He was the leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation.Of course, his reputation was still somewhat inferior to the Li Family\u2019s Li Moyun.\u201cBrother Su, you\u2019re back!\u201d When he saw Su Yi, Huang Qianjun shot to his feet, a welcoming smile on his face. He\u2019d been sitting there all on his own.Su Yi nodded. \u201cThe banquet\u2019s more than half over. What are you still doing here?Huang Qianjun said sheepishly, \u201cHow could I leave while you\u2019re still here? No matter what, I\u2019ll keep you company to the very end!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Su Yi. He naturally saw right through Huang Qianjun and Huang Yunchong.\u00a0They were unquestionably trying to turn a bad situation to their advantage, turning yesterday\u2019s disaster into an opportunity to mend their relationship, and ideally, to get closer to him!\u201cSu Yi, Cousin Jueyuan has something to say to you. Come with me.\u201d Suddenly, Wen Shaobei walked over. His gaze carried a sense of superiority, and his wording was crude and harsh.Su Yi glanced over at the crowd gathered around Wen Jueyuan. He was looking right back at him, his expression reserved and aloof.Then, Su Yi looked back at Wen Shaobei and said indifferently, \u201cGo tell him that he\u2019s welcome to talk to me, but that he should come here himself.\u201dThis Wen Shaobei had treated him with disdain from the moment he first arrived at the banquet. He\u2019d rebuked him, saying that a mere live-in son-in-law like him was unqualified to sit among them.Afterward, he\u2019d seized the opportunity to slander Wen Changtai, infuriating Wen Lingxue.But now, he was acting as Wen Jueyuan\u2019s lackey!Su Yi naturally felt no need to be polite to him, so he spoke as if Wen Shaobei were just an errand boy.\u201cYou\u2026 What did you just say?\u201d Wen Shaobei was stunned.\u00a0A mere live-in son-in-law dares put on airs in front of me?Huang Qianjun immediately approached, then glared with imposing viciousness. \u201cAre you blind, or deaf? Don\u2019t you understand human language?\u201dWen Shaobei froze. He was suddenly apprehensive.Huang Qianjun was infamous throughout Guangling City as a spoiled, domineering, proud hoodlum prone to violence. Just about every member of the younger generation was afraid of him.Wen Shaobei was naturally no exception.He gulped, then muttered, \u201cYoung Master Huang, this has nothing to do with you\u2026..\u201dBefore he could continue, Huang Qianjun spat contemptuously, \u201cWould you believe me if I said that, if this weren\u2019t the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet, I\u2019d beat you to a pulp here and now?\u201dWen Shaobei\u2019s face went ashen, and his forehead broke into cold sweats as he slumped over.\u201cLook at yourself! Pathetic!\u201d sneered Huang Qianjun. \u201cIf you want to remain in Guangling City going forward, you\u2019d best hurry up and\u00a0scram!\u201dWen Shaobei reacted as if he\u2019d been granted an imperial pardon; he was gone in a flash.Su Yi had witnessed this entire exchange, and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u00a0Indeed, the wicked are vulnerable to even greater villains. Few of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation\u00a0are any\u00a0use at all.\u201cBrother Su, please don\u2019t blame me for meddling. I just couldn\u2019t stand watching him act like that! A trivial branch member of the Wen Family dares treat you with such disrespect? He\u2019s simply sick of breathing!\u201d Facing Su Yi, Huang Qianjun\u2019s domineering\u00a0bossiness\u00a0disappeared. He was suddenly meek as could be, with a toadyish smile on his face.Su Yi clucked his tongue. \u201cYou sure are adaptable.\u201dIt was unclear whether Huang Qianjun picked up on the insult. He just laughed.\u201cWhat? Su Yi dares tell Cousin Jueyuan to pay\u00a0him\u00a0a visit?\u201d\u201cWho does he think he is?\u201d\u2026\u2026Not far away, and shortly after Wen Shaobei left, the youths clustered around Wen Jueyuan were in uproar. They were both shocked and furious.Wen Lingxue was there too, but she immediately rushed back to Su Yi\u2019s side.\u00a0This is bad!She reached him in a flash. Her fair features were wrought with concern. \u201cBrother-in-law, you should leave right away! Wen Shaobei is trying to stir up trouble between you and Cousin Jueyuan!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood Wen Shaobei. He was telling the truth. Wen Jueyuan is the one who wants to talk to me; it\u2019s not like I went looking for him, so shouldn\u2019t he take the initiative to approach me?\u201d Su Yi laughed.Huang Qianjun nodded along. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right, Brother Su!\u201dDespite herself, Wen Lingxue was dazed.\u00a0What\u2019s going on?Meanwhile\u2014Wen Jueyuan was already striding towards them, a pack of Wen Family youths trailing after him. They\u2019d already drawn the attention of several of the nearby guests.\u201cI\u2019m surprised. Su Yi, you\u2019re getting haughtier and\u00a0haughtier.\u201d Wen Jueyuan stood before Su Yi and stuck out his jaw, an intimidating glint in his eyes.He was the leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation; they\u2019d always been at his beck and call.Yet Su Yi, a mere live-in son-in-law, had refused to come see him. Worse, he\u2019d done it in front of everyone. This left Wen Jueyuan deeply displeased.\u201cWen Jueyuan, you put on airs first, got it?\u201d Huang Qianjun snicked. \u201cYou\u2019re less than a hundred feet away, yet you sent your lackey Wen Shaobei over to deliver a message on your behalf. You want to talk about haughtiness? You\u2019re quite haughty yourself, you know.\u201dHuang Qianjun was here as their guest, and he was Huang Yunchong\u2019s son. Although his cultivation was far inferior to\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s, he wasn\u2019t the least bit afraid.Wen Shaobei\u2019s expression flitted between shame and rage. He\u2019d just been called a \u201clackey\u201d in front of everyone. He even felt the urge to find a hole and hide himself inside.Wen Jueyuan furrowed his brow, and his cold gaze swept toward Huang Qianjun. \u201cThis is the Wen Family\u2019s private business. You\u2019d best not get involved!\u201dThen, he turned toward Su Yi and said flatly. \u201cYou have nothing to be afraid of. I won\u2019t lower myself by bullying a cripple like you. If word of that got out, it would only hurt my reputation.\u201dMany of those nearby couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cIs that all you wished to discuss with me?\u201d Su Yi just stood there, his hands clasped behind his back, and he spoke without the slightest ripple of emotion.Wen Jueyuan pondered briefly, then said, \u201cI just wanted to tell you that tonight, the city lord and the others approached you out of respect for Lingzhao. You might be her husband, but you\u2019re still just a live-in son-in-law, unworthy of the public eye!\u201dHis words were deeply demeaning, and many of the nearby Wen Family youths laughed with even less restraint.Throughout the Great Zhou, live-in son-in-laws remained behind closed doors!Wen Jueyuan\u2019s words represented what practically every last one of them was thinking.However, Su Yi didn\u2019t seem angry in the least. On the contrary, he shook his head, a hint of pity in his gaze.\u201cHa ha ha\u2026!\u201d Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.This was unquestionably the funniest thing he\u2019d heard all day!Others might not know it, but he was well aware that Fu Shan and Nie Beihu, as well as his father, Huang Yunchong, had all come here on Su Yi\u2019s account!The youths of the Wen Family had eyes, but they might as well have been blind! They were just begging for Su Yi to teach them a lesson!At first, Wen Lingxue was worried and angry. She\u2019d planned to argue on Su Yi\u2019s behalf, but when she heard Huang Qianjun\u2019s burst of exaggerated laughter, she was caught entirely off guard, unsure of how to respond.She wasn\u2019t the only one. Wen Jueyuan and the others were bewildered too.\u00a0What the f*ck is so goddamn funny!?Is Huang Qianjun an idiot or what?Wen Jueyuan glanced at him irritably. Then, his gaze returned to Su Yi, and he said coldly, \u201cGoing forward, if you dare borrow Lingzhao\u2019s name to run amok or intimidate others, I\u2019ll be the first to teach you a lesson! You\u2019d best bear my words in mind!\u201dWith that, he turned to leave. Judging from the look on his face, he disdained wasting any more words on someone like Su Yi.The other Wen Family youths hurried after him.\u201cI can\u2019t believe Cousin Jueyuan would act like that. I\u2019m so disappointed in him\u2026.\u201d Wen Lingxue bit her glossy lips, and her bright, beautiful eyes carried hints of dejection and melancholy.In the past, she\u2019d admired Wen Jueyuan immensely. She saw him almost as an older brother.But after what she\u2019d just witnessed, her impression of him soured. She no longer saw him in the same light.\u201cIt\u2019s ultimately just youthful ignorance and conceit. It\u2019s a common affliction among the young,\u201d said Su Yi casually.Huang Qianjun froze. Deep anguish rose within his heart.Two days ago, during their first meeting at the Immortal Gathering House, hadn\u2019t he been the very picture of \u201cyouthful ignorance and conceit\u201d? That was why Su Yi taught him a lesson, and that was what led to an even greater incident.He\u2019d even dragged his father, Huang Yunchong, down with him. He really should have known better!\u201cLingxue, come with me.\u201d Su Yi had no desire to linger at the banquet, so he turned to leave.\u201cOh!\u201d Wen Lingxue immediately rushed out of him. She thought that tonight\u2019s banquet was rather dull, too.Brother Su, how can you leave just like that? What\u2026 What about me?\u00a0Huang Qianjun inwardly cried out, suddenly anxious.Although he didn\u2019t know it, although Huang Yunchong and Nie Beihu looked as if they were casually chatting and laughing, they\u2019d been keeping an eye on Su Yi\u2019s every movement this entire time.When they saw Su Yi leave, they glanced at each other and, without any prior discussion, they both rose and bade the Wen Family farewell.Neither of these important figures could be bothered to waste any more time here\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Abstruse Spiritual Essence Pearl IncantationThe setting sun cast long shadows, the dusk red as fire.Throughout the courtyard, the jujube trees\u2019 leaves rustled in the wind.As soon as she stepped into Su Yi\u2019s residence, Wen Lingxue couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cBrother-in-law, actually, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to say to you.\u201dHer voice was sweet and delicate. She wore a simple, elegant dress, and beneath the light of the stars, her petite figure looked vibrant, pure, and utterly beautiful.Su Yi was stunned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked gently.Wen Lingxue suddenly looked ashamed of herself. \u201cBrother-in-law, seven days ago, me, my parents, and my uncles all saw Big Sister off. I wanted to notify you, but Mom wouldn\u2019t let me\u2026.\u201d She trailed off and hung her head guiltily.Su Yi suddenly understood what had happened.Seven days ago, Wen Lingzhao had begun her journey to Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. The entire Wen Family had been there to see her off, but they\u2019d \u201coverlooked\u201d him, her husband, the live-in son-in-law.This didn\u2019t surprise Su Yi at all.He and Wen Lingzhao were barely even strangers to each other.They\u2019d met for the first time on their wedding day.A year passed before they met for the second time, the night she returned home.They were husband and wife, but they hadn\u2019t exchanged so much as a single sentence.No, they hadn\u2019t said so much as a single word to each other.What\u00a0did surprise\u00a0Su Yi was that Wen Lingxue carried such guilt over this.Her willowy eyebrows knit together. \u201cAlso, I heard how hateful that Wei Zhengyang is, and that he made some absurd, over-the-line comments. Brother-in-law, whatever you do, don\u2019t lower yourself by arguing with the likes of him.\u201cI know my sister better than anyone. She\u2019s a bit cold, but there\u2019s no way she\u2019d cross any lines.\u201d She sounded concerned, and her tone was comforting.Su Yi looked right at the girl\u2019s fair face and beautiful features. For a moment, he was stunned. Then, he sighed with emotion. \u201cWho knows how many Bodhisattvas I\u2019ve seen in my life? Yet hardly any have been as kind-hearted as you.\u201dFor the first time in many years, he felt warm inside.In his past life, he\u2019d sought the Dao with single minded determination. He killed decisively, reaching the pinnacle of the Wilds\u2019 Nine Provinces by climbing over a mountain of corpses and wading through a sea of blood.Even his nine inheriting disciples both respected and feared him.Yet in this life, he was the son of a concubine, born into the Su Family of the Great Zhou\u2019s Jade Capital. He\u2019d been neglected from a young age, and he\u2019d developed a withdrawn, gloomy disposition.Even during the three years he spent cultivating at Blueriver Sword Manor, his personality was too dark and too solitary to make many friends.At the time, losing his cultivation and marrying into the Wen Family was no different from falling into the abyss; the shock was too much for him to overcome. He lived like a walking corpse, as if his heart had died.His circumstances were already so dire, but on top of that, the entire Wen Family looked down on him. Only Wen Lingxue treated him with sincere kindness.She\u2019d once taken great pains to plant sunflowers in his courtyard in hopes that when he saw their vibrant yellow petals in bloom, it would boost his spirits.She\u2019d once stuck attentively to his side, gently whispering the grand truths she\u2019d read in books, all in an attempt to comfort him, encourage him, and help him overcome his anguish.She knew he practically never went outside, so she\u2019d taken it upon herself to prepare all kinds of delicacies and deliver them to his door.\u2026..but then, the man he\u2019d been before regaining his memories had never paid her concern any heed.It was different now. After remembering his past life, he recalled everything Wen Lingxue had done for him over the past year. Of course he was moved! How could he not be?She wasn\u2019t just bright and beautiful; she had a pure and kind heart too!\u201cBrother-in-law, you\u2026. Really aren\u2019t angry?\u201d Wen Lingxue looked up, and her clear gaze bore into him. She sounded a bit uncertain.\u201cYou! You\u2019ve overthought this! It\u2019s completely understandable that your sister would resent and oppose our wedding arrangement. As for everyone else, well, if I cared about their opinions, I would have died of anger a long time ago,\u201d Su Yi said with a smile.Wen Lingxue finally let out a long pent-up breath. She smiled, her eyes narrowing like crescent moons as she laughed approvingly. \u201cBrother-in-law, you\u2019re so big-hearted!\u201dBig-hearted?Su Yi\u2019s expression went a little strange. Back in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, everyone knew Su Xuanjun was unwilling to suffer the slightest loss and that he was quick to avenge even the tiniest of grudges.But this little sister-in-law of his really was lovable!He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cLingxue, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to ask you. After marrying into the family, everyone has looked down on me\u2014everyone except for you. Tell me, why do you care about me so much?Wen Lingxue responded without hesitation, \u201cI\u2019ve never believed the man my sister married was worthless. I\u2026. I don\u2019t believe my brother-in-law is a good-for-nothing!\u201dAs she said this, the young woman\u2019s exquisite features filled with staunch determination.Su Yi laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe it?\u201dHer big, bright eyes stared intently at him for a moment. Suddenly, she giggled.\u201cYou\u2019re so good-looking,\u201d she said as if it were obvious. \u201cHow could you possibly\u00a0be a good-for-nothing?\u201dThis answer was entirely beyond his expectations. Despite himself, Su Yi was momentarily stunned. Shortly afterward, he couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter and give her a thumbs up. \u201cYou\u2019ve got good taste!\u201dWen Lingxue giggled, her laughter pure and picturesque.\u201cLingxue, I heard that a month from now, Pinecloud Sword Manor is hosting their end-of-year competition?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She nodded, but the smile disappeared from her face. \u201cWith my current cultivation, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be difficult to enter the top ten. After all, it\u2019s only been a year since I started cultivating at Pinecloud Sword Manor.\u201dThose who made it into the end-of-year competition\u2019s top ten could enter Pinecloud Sword Manor\u2019s \u201cFirst Court.\u201dAnd becoming a disciple of the First Court meant you were qualified to proceed to Blueriver Sword Manor and continue cultivating there!Pinecloud Sword Manor\u2019s influence was limited to Guangling City, while Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s influence extended throughout Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s nineteen cities!The two academies were on completely different levels!\u201cTwo days ago, I forgot to prepare your birthday present, but it\u2019s not too late to give it to you now,\u201d said Su Yi. He took a scroll out of his sleeves and whispered, \u201cThis is a breathing technique. It\u2019s not the highest level out there, but it\u2019s the best-suited for your current cultivation. If you keep at it for a month, it\u2019ll be enough to get you into the end-of-year competition\u2019s top ten.\u201dWen Lingxue\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally?\u201dSu Yi smiled and handed it to her. \u201cWould I lie to you? Right, don\u2019t mention this to anyone else. Once you\u2019ve memorized the incantation and understood its profundities, remember to burn the scroll immediately.\u201dAs he spoke this last bit, his expression turned serious.There was nothing for it! The breathing technique he\u2019d given Wen Lingxue was called the \u201cAbstruse Spiritual Essence Pearl\u00a0Incantation\u201d!Although he\u2019d only recorded its \u201cBlood Circulation Realm\u201d cultivation techniques, the complete incantation was ranked within the top ten on the \u201cMiraculous Arts of the Imperial Realm Leaderboard\u201d!Years ago,\u00a0he\u2019d taught\u00a0it to his youngest disciple, Qing Tang. It was thanks to this very incantation that her cultivation had soared, reaching the Imperial Realm in a single bound and making her the world-renowned \u201cEmpress Qing Tang\u201d!If a miraculous incantation of this level leaked, even just the Blood Circulation Realm section, it would bring Wen Lingxue no shortage of trouble.Su Yi didn\u2019t want to see that happen.Wen Lingxue instantly grew serious. She carefully put the little book away, then nodded firmly. \u201cBrother-in-law, I\u2019ll do as you say.\u201dShe still had no idea she\u2019d just inadvertently obtained a stroke of good fortune grand enough to send the world\u2019s cultivators into a mad frenzy.Had she known, she couldn\u2019t possibly have remained so calm.Su Yi didn\u2019t explain any further. He had plenty of comparably miraculous methods at his disposal.In his past life, everyone knew of Su Xuanjun \u201ccountless miraculous arts and supernatural powers.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ve got time to spare, come visit me once every seven days,\u201d instructed Su Yi. \u201cI\u2019ll instruct you in the profundities of the Martial Dao\u2019s Blood Circulation Realm.\u201dWen Lingxue\u2019s eyes lit up with wholehearted delight. \u201cFor sure!\u201dShe knew that, although he\u2019d since lost his cultivation, her brother-in-law had once been the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, famed throughout Cloudriver Province.With him to guide her, there was no need to worry about failing to make the end-of-year competition\u2019s top ten!\u201cYou should hurry back. If your mom discovers you here, she\u2019s sure to explode,\u201d said Su Yi. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh.His mother-in-law\u2019s temper was fiery as could be.Wen Lingxue glanced to both sides, as if guilty, then stuck out her little tongue. She immediately said, \u201cOkay, Brother-in-law, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dHer graceful figure turned, and she skipped away. It was clear she was in high spirits.Su Yi watched her disappear from his courtyard. Only after she\u2019d gone did he return to his room.Although it was already twilight out, the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s banquet was still going strong.But it had nothing to do with Su Yi anymore.Wen Lingxue didn\u2019t participate any further either. When she returned to her room, she took a bath, covered her slender frame in a bathrobe, then sprawled lazily on the bed. From time to time, she raised her legs into the air and kicked the bed, the snowy white of her calves coming in and out of view.Fresh out of the bath, she had a graceful elegance and pure beauty as she lay there, flipping through the scroll Su Yi had given her with the utmost haste.The scroll was thin, with only ten or so pages worth of text. The characters were full of vigorous sweeps and fine strokes. They were timelessly elegant, and just looking at them was calming to the eye. The sight was calming and tranquil.Brother-in-law\u2019s handwriting is just as good-looking as he is!\u00a0Wen Lingxue inwardly complimented him, but shortly after, the incantation inscribed within the swooping lines of text drew her attention.Although this\u00a0tome\u00a0only recorded the Abstruse Spiritual Essence Pearl\u00a0Incantation\u2019s\u00a0Blood Circulation Realm method, it was mysterious and obscure, each character and pause rife with profound mysteries.Never mind Wen Lingxue; even the most experienced cultivators of the Great Zhou couldn\u2019t possibly have comprehended its profundities in a short period of time.Fortunately, alongside the cultivation method were Si Yi\u2019s handwritten annotations. This meant it wasn\u2019t overly difficult for Wen Lingxue to comprehend.Soon, it was dawn, and the moon declined toward the west.Wen Lingxue had finally read through the entire cultivation method. Her beautiful face was filled with bewilderment, but more than that, undisguisable astonishment.She was young, but even if she were younger, she wasn\u2019t ignorant of cultivation.There was no way she\u2019d fail to realize just how mighty the incantation Su Yi gave her was.By comparison, both the Wen Family\u2019s ancestral cultivation techniques and those taught at Pinecloud Sword Manor were crude and full of omissions!No\u00a0wonder Brother-in-law\u00a0told me not to reveal this incantation to anyone! Mm, he was undoubtedly worried that it would bring me unnecessary trouble\u2026..\u00a0She was stunned, but she could dimly discern his good intentions. The thought made her feel warm inside, and she was both happy and moved.Before long, she took a deep breath, and her expression turned serious.She silently told herself,\u00a0Lingxue, Lingxue, no matter how hard it is or what obstacles you have to overcome, you have to find a way\u00a0for Brother-in-law\u00a0to cultivate again. He\u2019s currently\u2026. He\u2019s pitiful enough already\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - An Unexpected HarvestIt was the middle of the night.Su Yi sat in the lotus position, circulating his qi. He was relentlessly nourishing and tempering the power of his flesh and blood.This was a way of tempering the flesh recorded in the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique. It was designed for the second layer of the Blood Circulation Realm, \u201cRefining Muscle.\u201dAfter a while, Su Yi opened his eyes and furrowed his brow.\u00a0My cultivation speed is nowhere near what it was in the Refining Skin stage\u2026.It wasn\u2019t that he was in a hurry. What worried him was that his cultivation sessions were far less effective than before.There were two reasons for this.First, the medicines he consumed during his daily and nightly cultivation were mostly ordinary goods.Second, \u201cRefining Muscle\u201d was the second level of the Blood Circulation Stage. It was fundamentally far harder to cultivate than the Refining Skin stage.At my current rate of progress, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be at least half a month until I reach the peak of the Refining Muscle stage,\u00a0Su Yi thought to himself.Half a month wasn\u2019t long.But it would of course be even better if he could save himself some time.I wonder what happened to the Nine-Leafed King Ginseng Huang Yunchong gave me? If I could use that\u2026.As soon as this thought occurred to him, Su Yi shook his head.He knew his mother-in-law\u2019s personality far too well. Once a treasure like that fell into her hands, there was no way she\u2019d cough it back up.Suddenly, someone pushed open the gate to his courtyard, and Qin Qin\u2019s bossy, demanding voice rang out. \u201cHey moocher, come on out!\u201dSu Yi froze.\u00a0What a coincidence!He rose to his feet and left the room. Outside, he saw Qin Qing. The moonlight illuminated her and her inky green dress, right down to her mature beauty and graceful, swaying gait.She was already middle-aged, but her skin was fair and clear, her eyes were bright, and her features were both beautiful and symmetrical. Furthermore, she\u2019d taken excellent care of herself. It was no wonder that both of her daughters were so extraordinarily beautiful.\u201cDid you need me for something?\u201d Su Yi walked to her. It had been a year since his marriage into the Wen Family, but he\u2019d never once called his in-laws \u201cMom\u201d or \u201cDad.\u201dQin Qing didn\u2019t mind, either.At today\u2019s banquet, Fu Shan and Huang Yunchong, and the others\u2019 arrival let her hold her head up high. Her time in the spotlight left her in abnormally high spirits.When she looked at Su Yi, even he didn\u2019t seem quite as detestable as before.She got straight to the point. \u201cAs you know, Huang Yunchong gave our family two pieces of Nine-Leafed King Ginseng, and Fu Shan gave us a gift box as well. I\u2019m here to ask you what you plan to do with them.\u201dDespite himself, Su Yi was surprised. How could someone as shrewd as his mother-in-law take the initiative to discuss this with him?\u201cI have nothing to say on the matter,\u201d he said casually.Qin Qing snorted, then complained, \u201cI have no idea what the matriarch is thinking! Why did she insist I hand both gifts over to a leech like you?\u201dSu Yi instantly understood what was happening.The matriarch knew what others didn\u2019t. She knew Fu Shan and Huang Yunchong\u2019s gifts were intended for him.It was only natural that she wouldn\u2019t let Qin Qing embezzle them. If that happened, and if Fu Shan and Huang Yunchong found out about it, they might very well take it up with the entire Wen Family.Qin Qing glared at Su Yi. \u201cYou listen up! These gifts are for you\u00a0and\u00a0Lingzhao. That is to say, you can only take\u00a0your\u00a0share!\u201dWith that, she took one of the two treasure boxes she was carrying and opened it.Inside were two pieces of snow-white King Ginseng. Its root hairs were like silk floss, the main root crystal clear. With the box open, its fragrance quickly permeated the entire courtyard.Even just one whiff boosted the spirit and calmed the heart.Qin Qing gulped, increasingly resentful of the matriarch\u2019s forceful intervention.Otherwise, this ginseng was so incomparably precious, there was no way she\u2019d give Su Yi so much as a single root hair!\u201cChoose one,\u201d she said through gnashed teeth, feigning calm.Su Yi inwardly thought it rather funny. One glance and it was obvious she felt that parting with treasure was like carving up her flesh.\u201cNo, you choose first,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take whichever one is left.\u201dQin Qing\u2019s\u00a0expression noticeably\u00a0mellowed. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve got a bit of filial piety in you after all. We didn\u2019t spend a whole year feeding a sponger like you for nothing!\u201dAs she spoke, she immediately snatched up the noticeably smaller piece of ginseng, as if she were afraid Su Yi would change his mind, and handed it to him. \u201cHere, take it.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s expression was strange, but he reached out to accept it.Nine-Leafed King Ginseng was a spiritual medicine, and the quality of spiritual medicines wasn\u2019t contingent on their size.In this case, the smaller piece was actually higher quality\u2026.Qin Qing was beautiful, but she\u2019d never cultivated before. How could she possibly know something like that?She closed the gift box with obvious relish. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the big one for Lingzhao. She\u2019s cultivating at Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy now, and she can surely put it to good use.\u201cThen there\u2019s this box. City Lord Fu said to make sure to give it to you and Lingzhao to\u00a0open. Open it yourself and have a look.\u201d With that, she passed him the second box, her eyes shining with curiosity.At the banquet, she saw it clearly\u2014when the various VIPs in attendance heard that Fu Shan was delivering this on an eminent figure\u2019s behalf, they were stunned!Who was this person? Whoever they were, they were lofty enough to give even Fu Shan orders!Even now, it was a mystery.But the more mysterious someone\u2019s identity, the more curious and reverent others would be.Qin Qing was naturally no exception.When Su Yi exerted strength through his finger tips, the gift box carved of rare black jade opened. A misty, faint golden light instantly billowed out and dispersed. Against the darkness of the night sky, it was particularly eye-catching.Qin Qing\u2019s eyes widened, and she held her breath. Her expression filled with shock, infatuation, and fanaticism.Inside was a pair of rings carved of resplendent purple and gold crystal. The left ring\u2019s surface was carved with\u00a0a relief\u00a0of a phoenix. It was vivid and lifelike, with two inlaid ruby fragments for eyes.The ring on the left was carved with a coiling dragon, its head held high and its curled whiskers fluttering in the wind. It was so realistic, it almost looked alive.This was a set of rings, a dragon and a phoenix, two symbols of prosperity!\u201cWe\u2019re rich, we\u2019re rich! These are unquestionably rare and priceless treasures!\u201d Qin Qing\u2019s heart pounded and her eyes shone as she lit up with unconcealed delight.Even Su Yi was surprised this time.These rings weren\u2019t simple. They were carved of pristine condition \u201cPurple-streaked Gold\u201d, a \u201cspiritual material\u201d. It contained spiritual energy, and was in no way comparable with ordinary metals.The phoenix\u2019s eyes were made of \u201cCrimson Spirit Gems.\u201d Although they were each only the size of a sesame seed, they were each worth ten thousand gold!Taking a second glance at the dragon, he saw that its eyes were formed of \u201cSpirit Obsidian\u201d, a spiritual material full of abundant spiritual energy. Within the mundane world of the Great Zhou, it was priceless!Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin really spared no expense,\u00a0Su Yu thought to himself.These rings wouldn\u2019t have been particularly precious in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds.However, within the Great Zhou, they were unquestionably rare and marvelous treasures.Qin Qing suddenly cleared her throat, and her eyes flashed. \u201cSu Yi\u2026. How about I put these rings safely into storage for now? Then, when Lingzhao returns,\u00a0I can\u00a0give them to you together?\u201dSu Yi smiled. He naturally saw right through her petty schemes.\u201cDo as you see fit,\u201d he said straightforwardly.Qin Qing\u2019s beautiful features were suddenly uncertain.\u00a0What\u2019s \u2018do as you see fit\u2019 supposed to mean?She wanted to confiscate both rings and keep them forever. The problem was, the matriarch wouldn\u2019t let her!\u201cA precious object like this, falling into the hands of a deadbeat like you? What a reckless waste of treasure!\u201d Qin Qing gnashed her teeth, picked up the dragon ring, and hatefully handed it over. \u201cHere! Take it! Don\u2019t lose it!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d Su Yi smiled and took it.He knew full well that no matter how fierce, shrewd, and unreasonable his mother-in-law was, there was no way she\u2019d go against the matriarch\u2019s orders.\u201cEe? There\u2019s a letter in here too.\u201d Qin Qing took a sealed envelope from the base of the gift box.When she saw the words written on its surface, \u201cFor Master Su to open personally\u201d, she was stunned.\u201cMaster Su?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for me,\u201d said Su Yi. He reached out and took the envelope.\u201cYou? \u2018Master\u2019 Su?\u201d Qin Qing snickered as if she\u2019d just heard a joke.But then, throughout the entire Wen Family, only Su Yi was surnamed Su. Furthermore, this gift was intended for him and Wen Lingzhao. Despite her sneer, Qin Qing didn\u2019t question it.Su Yi ignored her jeers. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll head back to my room,\u201d he said with a faint smile, then turned around.When Lingzhao comes home, we have to find some way to get that ring back!\u00a0Qin Qing grit her teeth and stomped before turning and leaving.However, when she got back to her residence and her gaze swept across the mountain of gifts piled there, her mood instantly improved.At tonight\u2019s banquet, she and her husband had stood out, but that wasn\u2019t all. As a result of drawing so much attention, many influential figures had approached them of their own accord, and they even came bearing no small number of gifts.When she saw this glittering pile of gifts, Qin Qing smiled broadly, and her phoenix-like eyes closed.\u00a0Lingzhao, that girl, sure is promising!\u201cHoney, isn\u2019t it about time we retire for the night?\u201d Wen Changtai walked in and wrapped his arm around Qin Qing\u2019s slim and tender waist. His lips were already nearing her long, snowy neck.Tonight, he was in incomparably high spirits, and he\u2019d drunk more than usual.Whap!Qin Qing slapped Wen Changtai\u2019s hand away from herself then said irritably, \u201cOff to one side with you! You always just leave me hanging, every single time! Want to see me in bed? Get yourself in shape first!\u201dThen, she turned back to the treasure heap with great relish and started taking inventory.Seeing this, Wen Changtai let out a long sigh.Meanwhile, beneath the same night sky.Su Yi sat at his desk and opened the envelope, then took out a letter.Xiao Tianque had written it. It was respectful, but its contents were mostly just polite niceties.It was only at the very end that he got to the point. The letter said that due to an urgent family matter, he and his granddaughter Zi Jin had already left for Cloudriver Province. Should Su Yi need anything, he could go directly to City Lord Fu Shan for assistance.In short, it was a goodbye letter.After reading it, Su Yi casually held it over the candle and set it ablaze.He could roughly gauge Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin\u2019s intentions. They were undoubtedly just trying to build a stronger relationship with him, so there was no need for concern.This Nine-Leafed King Ginseng will save me a lot of time cultivating.\u00a0Su Yi\u2019s gaze returned to the snow-white spirit ginseng sitting quietly on the desk.Spiritual medicines were divided into nine tiers based on quality.The lowest was tier one, the highest, tier nine.This piece of Nine-Leafed King Ginseng was a tier-two spiritual medicine, valuable enough for even a Qi Accumulation-stage expert to treasure it!For the sake of repairing our relationship, Huang Yunchong sure spared no expense,\u00a0thought Su Yi. Two pieces of Nine-leafed King Ginseng, a pair of tier-two spiritual medicines, was priceless. Moreover, at least within Guangling City, there was no way to purchase them!Then, Su Yi glanced at the dragon ring carved of \u201cPurple-streaked Gold\u201d, and his heart stirred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - A Grandmaster\u2019s DisciplePurple-streaked Gold was a spiritual material, and it was ideal for forging weapons.Although the ring only contained the slightest quantity of Purple-Streaked Gold, if melted and mixed into ordinary metal, he could forge a blade sharp enough to cut iron as easily as it sliced through mud!As for the chunks of Spirit Obsidian that formed the dragon\u2019s eyes, although they were only the size of sesame seeds, they contained abundant spiritual energy, each on par with a tier-one spirit stone!In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, spirit stones were an indispensable part of cultivation.Based on their size and quality, they were divided in accordance with strict standards. There were nine tiers in total, with tier one at the bottom and tier nine at the top.Within the Four Realms of the Martial Dao, spirit stones tier three and below were enough to satisfy one\u2019s cultivation needs.But of course, that was within the Nine Provinces of the Wilds.Spirit stones existed even within a mundane nation like the Great Zhou. However, practically all of them were tier one, or tier two at most.Even so, they were seen as priceless treasures, and only peak-level clans possessed them.Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans monopolized practically every lucrative industry in the city, yet each family had no more than a hundred or so tier-one spirit stones in reserve!The ring had two pieces of Spirit Obsidian. This was equivalent to obtaining two tier-one spirit stones. Combined with the Purple-streaked Gold used to forge it, and it was naturally worth a fortune.I need to find some free time to visit a blacksmith and use the Purple-streaked Gold to forge a sword to wear at my side\u2026.As he pondered, Su Yi tapped the tips of his fingers against the ring. The two pieces of Spirit Obsidian popped from their sockets and rolled in the palm of his hand, catching the light and glinting.Afterward, he sat in the lotus position, one piece of Spirit Obsidian in each hand, and began circulating his energy.A torrent of pure spiritual power flooded into him, then circulated throughout his body alongside his energy. His blood and qi flared in sync, producing a powerful rhythm.This result was many times better than when he cultivated in the mulberry grove along the banks of the Great Azure!Su Yi could clearly sense that his blood and flesh were currently undergoing a deep tempering, as if he sat within a furnace of spiritual energy, reforging himself over and over again. His progress was terrifyingly quick.The moon cast its light over the world. Some families rejoiced, while others worried.The night sky was equally beautiful above the home of Guangling City\u2019s number one clan, the Li Family, but their clan hall was rife with tension.Bang!Family Head Li Tianhan flung his teacup, shattering it. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can just let this go!\u201dHis expression was dark and murderous.The Li Family higher-ups seated on both sides of the hall shook from head to toe. None of them dared speak.They naturally already knew what had happened at the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet.None of them would have guessed Family Head Huang Yunchong would suddenly turn on them.Even more surprising, City Lord Fu Shan and Commander Nie Beihu had personally stepped in to support the Wen Family!This resulted in Family Head Li Tianhan and his son, Li Moyun, slinking off in disgrace.What a huge embarrassment!There was no need to even question it; word of this incident would inevitably spread throughout Guangling City, dealing an enormous blow to the Li Family\u2019s prestige and reputation.\u201cReporting in! Family Head Huang responded to our message.\u201d An elder retainer scurried into the great hall and bowed in greeting.\u201cWhat did Huang Yunchong, that geezer, have to say for himself?\u201d asked Li Tianhan grimly.He hadn\u2019t let his anger overcome his rationality. He was well aware that there was something fishy about what happened at the Wen Family banquet today. There had to be something strange going on.That was why, immediately after returning home, he\u2019d sent an envoy to the Huang Family to try and learn \u201cthe truth\u201d from Huang Yunchong.The elderly retainer hesitated, then stuttered, \u201cFamily Head Huang said that he urges us not to oppose the Wen Family going forward, or else we\u2019ll inevitably invite grave peril upon ourselves\u2026.\u201dThe entire room was in uproar. Everyone was astounded.Even Li Tianhan froze, stunned. Then, his expression turned incomparably dark and sinister. \u201cThat old fool really said that?\u201dThe retainer hurriedly nodded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare say a single word out of turn.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t say why?\u201d Li Tianhan tried pressing for detail, but the retainer shook his head.\u201cHuang Yunchong definitely knows something, but he refuses to tell us. He\u2019s clearly up to no good!\u201d said one of the Huang Family higher-ups indignantly.The others nodded in agreement. They increasingly felt that there was something amiss about Huang Yunchong\u2019s response!\u201cFather, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to discuss with you in private,\u201d said Li Moyun, speaking up for the first time.Li Tianhan\u2019s brow furrowed. Then, he waved his hand. \u201cAll of you can leave.\u201dThe Li Family higher-ups discreetly rose and left the hall. None of them dared express the slightest displeasure.In the Li Family, Family Head Li Tianhan was a sovereign. His word was law.When they were the only ones left, Li Tianhan turned to his son. \u201cWhat is it you wanted to say?\u201d\u201cI think all of this can be traced back to Wen Lingzhao!,\u201d Li Moyun said calmly. \u201cDo you remember? When we stood in the Wen Family\u2019s clan hall, even after you demanded the Wen Family give up half their medicinal herb business, Huang Yunchong didn\u2019t voice any objections.\u201dLi Tianhan vaguely remembered that, and he nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It was only after I attempted to call upon the Huang Family\u2019s power to help us suppress the Wen Family that he had no choice but to clarify his position.\u201d\u201cBut when I suggested voiding Wen Lingzhao\u2019s marriage contract, he voiced his objections, entirely unprompted. That\u2019s what\u2019s really strange here.\u201d Li Moyun\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cThat\u2019s between us members of the younger generation. Why would a family head like him intervene? Especially since that particular matter doesn\u2019t involve the Huang Family in any way.\u201dLi Tianhan\u2019s\u00a0pupils constricted. By now, he was completely calm. When he recalled the various details of what happened at the banquet, he immediately sensed that something strange was afoot.Li Moyun took a deep breath, then continued, \u201cAfter that, neither Fu Shan nor Nie Beihu voiced any objections to our plans to divide the Wen Family\u2019s medicinal herb business between us either. Instead, they both unanimously objected to my attempt to intervene in Su Yi and Wen Lingzhao\u2019s marriage. Don\u2019t\u2026. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit strange?\u201d\u201cCould it\u00a0be that the\u00a0source of all this strangeness\u2026.\u00a0Really is Su\u00a0Yi and Wen Lingzhao?\u201d Li Tianhan furrowed his brow. \u201cBut that Su Yi is nothing but a cripple; he\u2019s not even worth a second thought. As for Wen Lingzhao, although she\u2019s already entered Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, she\u2019s just another disciple. She\u2019s not worthy of old fogies like Huang Yunchong, Fu Shan, and Nie Beihu going to such lengths to protect her.\u201dLi Moyun shook his head. \u201cFather, you might not know this yet, but I\u2019ve been keeping tabs on Wen Lingzhao\u2019s affairs for a long time now, and just yesterday, I received major news about her.\u201d\u201cWhat news?\u201d Li Tianhan was stunned.A flicker of barely discernible heat flickered within Li Moyun\u2019s gaze. \u201cVice Palace Master Zhu Guqing has taken a liking to Wen Lingzhao, and it\u2019s been decided that three months from now, at the academy\u2019s grand opening ceremony, she\u2019ll officially be accepting Wen Lingzhao as her disciple!\u201dLi Tianhan\u2019s expression shifted, and he sucked in a breath of cold air. \u201cSo that\u2019s it!\u201dZhu Guqing!She was one of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy\u2019s three vice palace masters, one of the mere handful of same-generation Martial Dao Grandmasters within Cloudriver Prefecture.Furthermore, it had been only thirty years since she began her cultivation. It was fair to say her talent transcended the masses!Rumor had it, her attainments in the Dao of the Sword were profound and inscrutable. The style she\u2019d mastered, \u201cthe Misty Haze Sword Stance\u201d, was famed far and wide. Even Grandmasters of the older generation endlessly sang its praises.If Wen Lingzhao became her disciple, she\u2019d be like a carp leaping over the dragon\u2019s gate, rising to prominence in a single bound! Her status and position would undergo a cosmic shift!The disciple of Martial Dao Grandmaster had a status so lofty, even some family heads would welcome them as a distinguished guest!\u201cNo wonder Huang Yunchong and Fu Shan went to such lengths, even if it meant standing at odds with our Li Family. So, a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple has emerged from within the Wen Family\u2026.\u201d Li Tianhan finally understood, but his heart was incomparably heavy.He\u2019d coveted the Wen Family\u2019s medicinal herb businesses for years, and he\u2019d tried to annex them on multiple occasions.Take tonight\u2019s incident at the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday feast. If not for those unexpected interventions, the Wen Family would have had no choice but to give into his demands!But now, the situation\u00a0had\u00a0changed entirely. With a \u201cGrandmaster\u2019s disciple\u201d like Wen Lingzhao, who in Guangling City would dare set their sights on the Wen Family?\u201cMy son, how do you plan to respond to this?\u201d After a moment\u2019s silence, Li Tianhan glanced at Li Moyun.She was a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple, and moreover, she was already married. Pursuing her was sure to be prohibitively difficult.Li Moyun said calmly, \u201cFather, the more dazzling Wen Lingzhao\u2019s talent, the more jarringly obvious Su Yi\u2019s ineptitude is. He\u2019s like a black mark on her life, and he\u2019s sure to do enormous damage to her reputation.He paused, then continued, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know why the Wen Family matriarch refused to annul the wedding contract, I can say with certainty that the higher Wen Lingzhao\u2019s status, the more she\u2019ll reject Su Yi.\u201dLi Tianhan furrowed his brow. \u201cMoyun, what exactly are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cLingzhao and I grew up together,\u201d said Li Moyuan with a smile. \u201cYou could even call us childhood sweethearts. My feelings for her have never wavered in the least! I\u2019d do\u00a0anything\u00a0for her.\u201dHe spoke calmly, but with the utmost determination.Li Tianhan\u2019s\u00a0pupils constricted. \u201cYou plan to kill Su Yi?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. So long as Su Yi dies, their marriage will \u2018die of natural causes\u2019 along with him. That\u2019ll be good for Wen Lingzhao, and for me, too. It\u2019ll even benefit the Wen Family as a whole!\u201d Li Moyun\u2019s eyes flashed with grim determination. \u201cTherefore, Su Yi must die! He\u2019s nothing but a cripple; there\u2019s no need for him to remain in this world!\u201dLi Tianhan fixed his gaze on his son. Then, suddenly, he broke into a gratified smile. \u201cMy boy, you\u2019ve really grown up! You have your own thoughts, and you\u2019re making your own choices.\u201cBut if you want to kill Su Yi, you must not be hasty! Everyone knows you only have eyes for Wen Lingzhao, and furthermore, you revealed your interest at the banquet. If Su Yi dies suddenly at a time like this, everyone will suspect you.\u201dLi Moyun nodded, his gaze calm and self-assured. \u201cFather, you can relax. A lion uses its full strength even when catching a hare. I naturally won\u2019t be the least bit complacent, nor will I do anything to bring suspicion upon myself!\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll wait for you to bring the Wen Family\u2019s \u2018Grandmaster\u2019s disciple\u2019 home! Li Tianhan laughed heartily and patted his son on the shoulder. \u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll personally act as a go-between. I trust that the Wen Family won\u2019t refuse a marriage alliance with us.\u201dDespite hearing this, Li Moyun sighed to himself.Wen Lingzhao was to become the disciple of a Grandmaster; it was already set in stone.With this incomparably dazzling status, would she really want to be with a childhood sweetheart like him?Li Moyun took a deep breath, then steeled himself.\u00a0No matter the outcome, I have to strive with all my might!Seth's ThoughtsThe most common word for academy is \u201c\u5b66\u9662\u201d, but the word I'm translating as \"academy\" is \u5b66\u5bab, a combination of the characters for \"studying\" and \"palace.\" It's still essentially just an institute of learning, but it contains the character for palace, which is why Zhu Guqing is called a \"vice palace master.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - The Apricot ClinicOver the next few days, Su Yi lived according to a set rhythm.In the early morning, he\u2019d walk along the Great Azure and practice martial arts in the mulberry grove. At noon, he\u2019d return to the city and purchase herbal medicines, then go home to prepare a medicinal bath to refine his body.Just three days had passed, but he\u2019d already refined all the energy contained within the sesame-seed-sized Spirit Obsidian pieces.In the process, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the Refining Muscle stage.The next step was beginning his \u201cRefining Sinew\u201d stage cultivation.This cultivation speed was already shocking, and his breakthrough came over ten days faster than Su Yi\u2019s initial estimate.However, this rate of improvement was also entirely reasonable.After all, he was expending fifteen hundred taels worth of medicinal ingredients per day, and the Spirit Obsidian he\u2019d just refined was incomparably precious. Add that to the profundity of the Pine and Crane Body Refining Art, and it would have been difficult\u00a0not\u00a0to improve.\u201cJust two thousand taels left\u2026.\u201d Su Yi slumped in a rocking chair beneath one of the courtyard\u2019s jujube trees, enjoying the sun. Mottled sunlight passed through the leaves, forcing him to squint.He\u2019d just finished an extreme cultivation session, and his body needed time to rest and readjust.In just ten days, he\u2019d already spent eight of the ten thousand taels Zi Jin had given him. Soon, he\u2019d have no choice but to consider how he\u2019d go about earning more.But then, there\u2019s no need to panic about making money.\u00a0Su Yi stretched out his hand and picked up the cup of ginseng tea beside him, then drained it in a single gulp.Instantly, a refreshing warmth flowed down his throat, then coursed through him like the tide, spreading to every bone in his body. His blood and qi flared in response, and his exhausted flesh began to make a rapid recovery.In an instant, his full-body exhaustion vanished!This was a medicinal tea he\u2019d brewed with the Nine-Leafed King Ginseng\u2019s leaves. He\u2019d also added blood poria, fleeceflower root, and other ingredients. The resulting liquid contained abundant life force and spiritual energy.If I brew tea from the leaves, use the root hairs to make soup, and chew the fruit raw, this single piece of Nine-Leafed King Ginseng can sustain my cultivation for several days,\u00a0thought Su Yi.It was, after all, a tier-two spiritual medicine; it could satisfy even a Qi Accumulation expert with room to spare.Tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll go forge myself a sword!\u00a0He exhaled, and his eyes brightened.In the past, he\u2019d used his sword to prove his Dao. In the end, his sword suppressed the starry skies, and he reigned supreme over the Wilds. The people respectfully called him \u201cthe Swordmaster\u00a0of Abstruse\u00a0Force.\u201dHis choice to reincarnate was similarly for the sake of pursuing the Dao of the Sword to even higher realms!It was fair to say that Su Xuanjun\u2019s life was centered around the Dao of the Sword.As a sword cultivator, how could he walk around without a weapon?Suddenly, the voice of a servant girl resounded from the gates. \u201cSir, the lady of the house requests your presence in the atrium. She says there\u2019s something she wishes to discuss with you.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s surprise, he called back, \u201cAlright.\u201d\u2026\u2026The atrium.When Su Yi arrived, his mother and father-law were both seated at the dining table.A sumptuous lunch, the dishes still piping hot, was laid across the table.Wen Changtai glanced at Su Yi, then said, \u201cSit down and eat with us.\u201d\u201cWait! Qin Qing glared at him in displeasure.Wen Changtai immediately shut up, lowered his head, and kept eating in silence.Su Yi was long accustomed to this. His father-in-law, Wen Changtai, was an honest sort, good-natured and unambitious, who wanted nothing more than to live out his days in peace.Qin Qing set down her chopsticks and said, \u201cSu Yi, have you heard that Lingzhao is about to become the direct disciple of a Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy vice palace master?\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cI heard.\u201dThe day after the matriarch\u2019s birthday celebration, word spread that Wen Lingzhao had been chosen by Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy\u2019s vice palace master, Zhu Guqing as her direct disciple.Within Cloudriver Prefecture, Zhu Guqing was a rare Martial Dao Grandmaster, famed far and wide. To ordinary martial artists, she was like a distant god or soaring dragon.For Wen Lingzhao to win the good graces of a Grandmaster like her was an unexpected stroke of fortune, and the entire Wen Family was in uproar.When word spread, it stirred up great waves and shook the entire city. Who knew how many people were in uproar over this?But to Su Yi, it was just a bit unexpected, that\u2019s all.It had been less than half a month since Wen Lingzhao joined Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, yet she\u2019d already won the favor of a Martial Dao Grandmaster. Not even Su Yi would have anticipated that.But at the same time, he wasn\u2019t exactly \u201cshocked.\u201dShe was to become the disciple of a Martial Dao Grandmaster, an Inner Furnace expert. What did that amount to?Qin Qing\u2019s beautiful features shone with delight. \u201cThis is an enormous stroke of fortune for the entire Wen Family. This very morning, the family head personally promised our family a thousand taels of gold, ten clusters of pearls, and the deeds to nine buildings. Furthermore, he\u2019s decided to place Bluefinch Street\u2019s \u2018Apricot Clinic\u2019 under our management!\u201dAs she said this, she looked entranced. She was practically beaming; it was obvious how pleased she was.The past few days had undoubtedly been among the best of her life. No matter who saw her, they greeted her with a smile and spoke with enthusiasm and flattery.Even the family head and matriarch treated her with noticeably more respect than before!This left Qin Qing somewhat dazed; it didn\u2019t feel quite real.\u201cThat really is wonderful news,\u201d Su Yi said perfunctorily.Qin Qing was instantly on guard. \u201cNone of this wealth is for you. Don\u2019t even think about it!\u201dSu Yi didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. He lacked money, but he had countless ways to earn more. What need was there to covet such a paltry sum? He didn\u2019t know what Qin Qing was thinking, either; her beautiful face flitting between different expressions unpredictably.Finally, she seemed to reach a decision. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year since you married into the family. You can\u2019t just sit around mooching off us forever, so I plan to send you to take over the Apricot Clinic\u2019s management!\u201dSu Yi was stunned.Although Bluefinch Street wasn\u2019t in the most prosperous part of Guangling City, it was densely populated and a gathering point for people of all trades.Apricot Clinic had been in business there for years, and they had no shortage of customers.What piqued Su Yi\u2019s suspicion was that the mother-in-law who\u2019d always loathed and detested him was giving him benefits out of nowhere. Was she\u00a0really\u00a0doing this out of the goodness of her heart?He didn\u2019t have to wonder for long. Qin Qing\u2019s expression turned serious, and she said sharply, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, although you\u2019re going to go manage Apricot Clinic, I expect you to turn in a thousand taels of silver a month! Any less, and don\u2019t blame me for being heartless!\u201dSu Yi finally understood.\u00a0That\u2019s more like it! This is the mother-in-law I remember. She\u2019d never do something nice for me without a reason.Wen Changtai couldn\u2019t help but interject, \u201cA thousand taels a month?\u201dQin Qing said triumphantly, \u201cI stayed up all night last night, and I finally got the Apricot Clinic\u2019s ledgers in order. If business continues at its current rate, it\u2019ll earn a thousand taels a month, give or take three hundred!\u201dSu Yi was stunned. It seemed that in his mother-in-law\u2019s eyes, he was nothing but free hard labor, and unpaid labor at that\u2026What\u2019s even happening here? In my past life, I was the sovereign of the Wilds, the Swordmaster\u00a0of Abstruse\u00a0Force. Now, post reincarnation, even my shrewish mother-in-law can exploit me as she pleases?\u201cWhat happens if he can\u2019t earn a thousand in a month?\u201d asked Wen Changtai.Qin Qing snorted, then said deftly, \u201cI\u2019m not unreasonable! He can just pay the rest off later. It\u2019s fine so long as he makes up the difference within three months.\u201dShe paused, then continued leisurely, \u201cBut in that case, he\u2019ll have to pay a little extra in interest. The more he owes us, the higher the interest will be. If he can\u2019t pay off his debts within three months, he\u2019ll have to pay interest on his interest, and his total debt will grow non-stop, multiplying without end.\u201dJust listening, the mild, good-natured Wen Changtai couldn\u2019t help but gasp. He was starting to feel sorry for Su Yi.Qin Qing took a sip of tea to wet her throat, and her sharp gaze bore into Su Yi. \u201cYou won\u2019t default your debts, right?\u201dInstead of answering, Su Yi asked a question of his own. \u201cAnd what if I earn over a thousand taels per month?\u201dQin Qing burst into laughter. \u201cYou might be a moocher, but you\u2019ve still got\u00a0some\u00a0ambition!\u00a0Even you\u00a0understand that the more money you earn, the better,\u201d she said approvingly. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go right ahead and tell you that if you earn over a thousand taels, you can keep the rest.\u201d\u201cAlright. It\u2019s settled,\u201d Su Yi agreed without a second thought.Qin Qing was stunned. She never would have guessed that he\u2019d agree so forthrightly, and it left her uneasy.She thought about it, then warned him again. \u201cIf you dare try any funny business, don\u2019t blame me for my poor manners!\u201dNot long after, Su Yi left.Qin Qing was sending him to the Apricot Clinic tomorrow. He\u2019d live there from now on.This was actually good news for him.Remaining in the Wen Family estate made everything inconvenient, but it would be different outside.Soon, only Qin Qing and Wen Changtai remained in the atrium.Wen Changtai couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhy did you send Su Yi to manage the clinic? Second Brother\u2019s been in control there for a long time, and everyone there is on his payroll, from the physicians to the servants.\u201dHe sighed despite himself. \u201cIf you send Su Yi on his own, they\u2019re sure to bully him! How much is he going to suffer there?\u201d\u201cIf you were as capable as your second brother, how could the matriarch have let Su Yi marry into our family in the first place?\u201d snapped Qin Qing. \u201cDo you have any idea how deeply this arrangement has wronged our daughter?\u201cNow look at your oldest brother. He\u2019s the head of the family, with all the power and authority that entails! He\u2019s in control of the entire family\u2019s assets. How impressive is that? Now look at you! You\u2019ve failed at both studying and martial arts, and you never strive for anything! All the good stuff has wound up in your elder brothers\u2019 hands!\u201cIf not for me personally taking charge of our family\u2019s affairs, with your meager capabilities, the rest of the family would have long since bullied us to death!\u201dQin Qing rebuked him so viciously that Wen Changtai dared not say a word. He could only grimace. But then, he\u2019d always been like that. He knew full well that compared to his brothers, he was indeed quite mediocre.Furthermore, Qin Qing\u2019s strong disposition and shrewdness only offset his own ineptitude.Some time passed before Qin Qing finally seemed to calm down. \u201cI know the Apricot Clinic has always belonged to your second brother, but that\u2019s in the past. From now on, it belongs to us!\u201cAs for whether Su Yi will get bullied\u2026 Hmph, don\u2019t look down on that son-in-law of ours.\u201dWen Changtai was stunned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cI heard that a few days ago, Su Yi taught Huang Qianjun a lesson over at the Immortal Gathering House. I initially assumed that the Huang Family wouldn\u2019t let him off, but look at him! He\u2019s still alive and well; they didn\u2019t so much as harm a hair on his head.\u201d Qin Qing laughed coldly. \u201cAlthough I can\u2019t figure out their reasoning, my instincts tell me that something strange is afoot!\u201dShe paused, then sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity. Were he still Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect Sword Chief, he might have just barely been a good enough match for Lingzhao.\u201cBut now she\u2019s about to become a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple! Compare her to Su Yi! He has no strong points at all!\u201d Her tone was full of dense resentment.\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t lost his cultivation, he never would have become our son-in-law in the first place,\u201d said Wen Changtai in an attempt to comfort her. \u201cAfter all, at the time, Lingzhao had yet to enter Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy.\u201d\u201cYou shut your mouth!\u201d Qin Qing slammed the table in fury, cutting him off. \u201cAre you comforting me or just poking fun at Lingzhao? Or have you been so \u2018frustrated\u2019 lately that you need someone to teach you a lesson?\u201dWen Changtai was visibly uneasy. He smiled sheepishly, but said nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - The New Manager is HereMorning the next day.Su Yi took his luggage and left the place he\u2019d lived in for the past year.From this day forth, he would manage the Apricot Clinic, and he\u2019d live there, too.I\u2019ll skip practicing on the banks of the Great Azure today. I can go once I have everything in order.I\u2019ll have to set aside finding a blacksmith and forging a sword for now too, thought Su Yi as he left the Wen Family estate.Guangling City, Bluefinch Street.The streets were crowded and bustling with activity.In the Great Zhou, only a tiny minority cultivated the Martial Dao. The vast majority of the citizens were ordinary mortals.They spent their lives working to make a living and interpreting the ups and downs of the world around them.Su Yi strolled leisurely amidst the crowd, feeling indescribably relaxed.At the Apricot Clinic, I\u2019ll be able to work with all kinds of medicinal ingredients on a daily basis. I can use them to cultivate the Martial Dao.This is actually a good thing for me. I\u2019ll be able to increase my cultivation speed.But then, that\u2019s on the condition that I can earn a thousand taels of silver a month\u2026Hm?Su Yi suddenly stopped in his tracks.A youth in luxurious brocade robes was smiling at him. He approached eagerly, and before even reaching Su Yi, he clasped his fist in delight. \u201cBrother Su, you\u2019re out for a stroll too? What a coincidence!\u201dThis was none other than Huang Qianjun.When the famed delinquent young master of Guangling City appeared, the pedestrians hurriedly retreated, as if he were a natural disaster or vicious beast.\u201cIt seems to me you\u2019ve been waiting for me this entire time.\u201d Su Yi glanced at him. Who\u2019d be so bored as to go for a stroll this early in the morning?Huang Qianjun looked somewhat embarrassed. He started to explain, \u201cBrother Su\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d interrupted Su Yi. \u201cYour father made you do it, right? You can go back and tell him there\u2019s no need for this.\u201dAs he spoke, he continued ahead.Huang Qianjun suddenly had a guilty conscience. Su Yi had seen right through him.It was true; his father, Huang Yunchong, had ordered him to seize every available opportunity to get close to Su Yi. No matter what, he had to build a connection with him.If there weren\u2019t any opportunities, he\u2019d just have to make opportunities himself!At the time, Huang Qianjun had naively asked his father if he wanted him to become Su Yi\u2019s friend.Huang Yunchong looked at him in disappointment and rebuked his wishful thinking, saying \u201cNever mind becoming friends; if you can so much as become his subordinate, we\u2019ll have cause to light incense in gratitude!\u201dThat was what led to today\u2019s encounter.How exactly do I become a worthwhile subordinate, anyway?\u00a0As he watched Su Yi gradually fade into the distance, Huang Qianjun gnashed his teeth, steeled himself, and dashed after him.He suddenly recalled the attendants who used to tag after him. They\u2019d always stuck by his side, letting him call the shots. They were articulate, considerate, loyal, and obedient without question\u2026.Most importantly, they followed his lead in all things!Now, Huang Qianjun planned to learn from their example\u2026.Su Yi noticed that Huang Qianjun was following him, but he paid him no heed.Brother Su isn\u2019t making me leave!\u00a0Huang Qianjun inwardly rejoiced. He dashed up to Su Yi, noticed the luggage he had slumped over his shoulder, and said shyly, \u201cBrother Su, how about I carry your bag for you?\u201d\u201cIf you want.\u201d Su Yi tossed over his luggage.A silkpants, a delinquent young master, yet here he was, eager to be an errand boy. What exactly was going on in his brain?Huang Qianjun carefully accepted it. Internally, he was practically frenzied with joy.\u00a0Does this mean\u2026 That Su Yi doesn\u2019t really mind having me around?If Father knew about this, he\u2019d be happy for me, right?Now I just have to make a good showing!I, Huang Qianjun, have thrown away my pride. There\u2019s no need to fear failing to become a good subordinate right?Su Yi would never have guessed that just allowing Huang Qianjun to carry his luggage would make him so happyBefore long, Su Yi saw the \u201cApricot Clinic\u201d signboard in the distance.The clinic was a three-story building, built facing the street, with an old-fashioned charm.The Wen Family was one of Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans, and they built their foundations on medicine; they monopolized over ninety percent of the local medicinal herb trade, and they owned thousands of acres of medicinal herb plots.Furthermore, they employed over a thousand medicine pickers, who would venture deep into the mountains in search of herbal medicines on regular intervals.Just within Guangling City, the Wen Family ran sixteen clinics and nineteen apothecaries.The Apricot Clinic was just one of them.When Su Yi arrived, there was already a long line of patients waiting outside the Apricot Clinic\u2019s doors.But then, two servants stepped outside to send the crowd packing. \u201cEveryone, hurry and find another clinic! The Apricot Clinic isn\u2019t open for business today!\u201cWe have no other choice! We\u2019re changing leadership today, and our replacement manager has yet to arrive.\u201dThe group waiting in line were instantly in uproar. Some sighed in disappointment, while others shook their heads helplessly. Some even cursed the servants out. It was pure chaos.But the two servants didn\u2019t care. They simply turned, walked back into the clinic, and were about to close the door when\u2026\u201cWait,\u201d said a voice. \u201cThe new manager is here. We aren\u2019t closing today.\u201dThe two servants froze, and the line of would-be patients looked over too.They then saw a lean, handsome youth in blue cloth robes walking right towards them.\u201cWho are you?\u201d said one of the servants suspiciously.\u201cYour new manager,\u201d said Su Yi flatly. He looked the Apricot Clinic up and down.\u00a0This isn\u2019t far from the Great Azure. The location isn't bad.\u201cYou\u2019re\u00a0Su Yi?\u201d blurted the servant.Su Yi!The other servant finally reacted, snickering, \u201cYou haven\u2019t even stepped through our doors, yet you already think yourself our manager? I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be out the door before your butt even has time to warm your seat!\u201dWhen he heard this, Su Yi keenly picked up on something: it seemed that due to his impending arrival, the clinic\u2019s entire staff had talked things over and agreed to teach their new \u201cmanager\u201d his place.\u201cSo it\u2019s him! That\u2019s the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law.\u201d\u201cNo wonder the Apricot Clinic is closed for the day. It\u2019s because of him!\u201d\u2026The people waiting in line started whispering among themselves.Who in Guangling City didn\u2019t know about Su Yi, the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law?Poor Wen Lingzhao had been forced to marry a cripple! Who knew how many people, even now, lamented over her misfortune?\u201cHonored Son-in-law, pardon my boldness, but I urge you to go home and quietly live out your days as a live-in son-in-law should. Someone like you is in no way fit to manage the Apricot Clinic\u2019s affairs!\u201dThe servant was increasingly fearless, his tone enigmatic and his expression utterly disdainful.Su Yi glanced at him, then said faintly, \u201cGoing forward, you needn\u2019t come back to the Apricot Clinic.\u201dThe servant was stunned. He pointed at himself. \u201cAre you firing me? Hahaha! I forgot to tell you, but my family has served the Wen Family\u2019s Second Elder for three generations, and we\u2019ve long since signed an indenture agreement. No one else can kick me out!\u201dHe\u2019s sold himself into indentured servitude, so why is he acting so proud?\u00a0Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but gasp in amazement.Su Yi walked up and patted the servant on the shoulder. \u201cYou sold yourself to the Wen Family, not to the Apricot Clinic. I\u2019m the manager here now. If you really don\u2019t want to leave, I won\u2019t object, but don\u2019t expect any wages.\u201d\u201cYou dare?\u201d The servant\u2019s eyes went bloodshot. He was furious!\u201cScrew your granny! How dare you talk to my Brother Su Like that?\u201d Huang Qianjun had followed Su Yi all the way here, and he could no longer restrain his temper. He strode forward, then slapped the servant right across the face.Whap!The servant staggered, then rolled down the stairs, shrieking like a slaughtered pig. By the time he crawled to his feet, his head was bloodied and his cheeks were red and swollen.\u201cYou fu\u2014!\u201d He was just about to curse when he saw just who had hit him. A chill ran down his spine, and he said in a daze, \u201cYoung\u2026 Young Master Huang?\u201dThe crowd waiting to see a doctor was in uproar; they\u2019d just recognized the infamous delinquent young master.\u201cYou\u2019re still here? Should I interpret this as you inviting me to your house for a visit?\u201d Huang Qianjun\u2019s eyes carried a threat of violence.The servant dared not linger. He scampered off, too scared to even fart.\u201cThe hell?\u201d Huang Qianjun spat, then looked around. When he realized Su Yi had already gone inside the clinic, he hurriedly dashed in after him.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhy is the Huang Family silkpants mixed up with the Wen Family live-in son-in-law?\u201d\u201cWho knows\u2026.?\" The crowd discussed this amongst themselves, all of them utterly stunned.The smell of medicine permeated the interior of the Apricot Clinic, calming the heart.Row after row of medicine cabinets were on display, with all sorts of decorations and furniture embellishing different areas. The clinic was clean and spacious.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Su Yi stood with his hands behind his back, pleased with what he saw.At least for a while, this was to be his base of operations.\u201cWen Family son-in-law, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d A gaunt middle-aged man glared at him. Around a dozen others stood beside him: stewards, assistants, apprentice apothecaries, and servants. All of them wore unsightly expressions on their faces.They\u2019d just witnessed everything that happened outside.Su Yi walked behind the counter and casually sat in the wooden armchair reserved for the manager, then stretched before glancing at the middle-aged man.\u201cFrom this day forth, I am the manager of the Apricot Clinic,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think, but if you want to keep your jobs, you\u2019d best not stand in my way.\u201dA man in grey immediately let out a cold laugh. \u201cYou understand nothing! What right do you have to act as our manager? If you provoke all of our old hands, they\u2019ll leave, and the Apricot Clinic will inevitably close its doors forever!\u201dSu Yi glanced at him. \u201cIf you refuse to listen to me, you\u2019re welcome to leave too.\u201dThe man in grey froze, as if he didn\u2019t quite believe his ears. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dThe lean middle-aged man beside him warned him expressionlessly. \u201cThat\u2019s Wu Yong! He\u2019s an old hand here, and he\u2019s worked diligently on the Wen Family\u2019s behalf for thirty years. He\u2019s experienced and capable\u2026.\u201dBefore the man even finished, Su Yi drummed his fingers against the table and cut off him. \u201cI don\u2019t care who he is. If he doesn\u2019t want to work, he\u2019s to leave immediately. Whether Apricot Clinic closes its doors or not has nothing to do with any of you.\u201dThe group\u2019s expressions changed, and they looked at each other.None of them would have anticipated that the universally disdained Wen Family live-in son-in-law would be so domineering and impervious to reason!\u201cHmph! I refuse to serve a mere live-in son-in-law with such a wildly inflated ego!\u201d The man in grey, the one they called Wu Yong, swept his sleeves and left in a huff.However, halfway to the door, Huang Qianjun blocked his path. The famed delinquent silkpants drawled, \u201cWu Yong, right? You\u2019re welcome to leave, but I\u2019ll be paying your house a visit tonight. Let\u2019s have a nice chat, you and I!\u201dWu Yong\u2019s expression changed dramatically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - I Can Treat Patients TooWithin Guangling City, Huang Qianjun was a rare delinquent young master.His temper was vicious, explosive, arrogant, and domineering. Who knew how many wicked deeds he had to his name?If someone like him showed up as a \u201cguest\u201d, it would be no different from a Yama King of Hell appearing on their doorstep!Wu Yong had been furious mere moments ago, but now, he froze, his gaze dark and uncertain. It was as if his legs were full of lead; he dared not leave.Huang Qianjun smiled leisurely. \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, just sit tight and follow Brother Su\u2019s commands. Otherwise, I don\u2019t mind sending my people to your home to \u2018greet\u2019 your relatives.\u201dHe\u2019s targeting my family?\u00a0Wu Yong\u2019s eyes went wide. He slumped like a wilted flower and slunk back to his original location.Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.\u00a0You refused to talk this over. It took a villain to force you to lower your head. Was all this really necessary?He glanced at Huang Qianjun. \u201cTake it down a notch.\u201dHuang Qianjun hurriedly flashed him a toadyish grin. \u201cYou\u2019re right to chastise me, Brother Su.\u201dWhen the lean middle-aged man saw this, he felt a sudden chill.After learning that Su Yi was to take up management of the Apricot Clinic, they\u2019d decided to use whatever means necessary to send him packing.Who wanted to serve a paltry, insignificant live-in son-in-law?But they never could have anticipated that he\u2019d bring such an infamous \u2018attack dog\u2019 with him!They dared offend Su Yi, but who among them dared offend the son of Family Head Huang?Even if Huang Qianjun beat them to a pulp, it was unlikely that the Wen Family could offer much help!\u201cWen Family Son-in-law, we certainly have no plans to oppose you. Please, be at ease.\u201d The gaunt middle-aged man took a deep breath and clasped his fist, his attitude far more restrained than before.\u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood. I\u2019m not desperate to keep you all here.\u201d Su Yi shook his head, then said flatly. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s sold themselves to Wen Changqing and his family can leave.\u201dEven before departing for the Apricot Clinic, he knew that it had long since been under the jurisdiction of Wen Changqing and his line.But as of today, it was Su Yi\u2019s territory. He naturally had to do a little housecleaning first. This would prevent him from hitting hidden snags down the line and save him a lot of trouble.\u201cWhat?\u201d Several of their expressions changed immediately.The gaunt middle-aged man couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cWen Family Son-in-law, this isn\u2019t quite appropriate, is it? Even if they\u2019d indentured themselves to the Second Elder, they still work for the Wen Family. Won\u2019t this hurt and disappoint loyal employees?\u201dSu Yi just sat there quietly. He said nothing.Huang Qianjun instantly realized it was his turn. He cleared his throat, then swept his gaze around the room. \u201cEveryone, you\u2019d best not make things difficult for my Brother Su!\u201dThis delinquent young master\u2019s words carried a powerful implied threat.Several of the employees left right away, some dejected, some indignant, some bitter\u2026.But all of them left without voicing a single complaint.They couldn\u2019t risk it. What would they do if they offended Huang Qianjun and he really showed up on their doorstep?Finally, only seven of the Apricot Clinic\u2019s old hands remained.The gaunt middle-aged man was the steward, Hu Quan. He hadn\u2019t signed any sort of indenture agreement with the Wen Family.However, although he didn\u2019t leave, he clearly carried a grudge. His expression was dark and unsightly.Hu Quan aside, the others were all apprentice apothecaries and assistants.\u201cWhat about Doctor Wu?\u201d Su Yi asked suddenly.He remembered that before, a doctor by the name of Wu Guangbin worked at the Apricot Clinic. He was locally famous, and the citizens of Guangling City trusted him.\u201cElder Wu inadvertently caught a chill last night,\u201d said Hu Quan perfunctorily. \u201cHe\u2019s fallen ill, and he\u2019s currently at home recuperating.\u201dHe paused, then continued, \u201cOur clinic has two other physicians, but yesterday, one went home to visit relatives, while the other is visiting a friend in Cloudfall City, on the other side of the Great Azure. Neither is currently at the clinic.\u201dHuang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but laugh coldly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three physicians in total, but all of them are busy with other matters? Isn\u2019t that a bit too much of a coincidence?\u201dHu Quan shrugged as if it had nothing to do with him. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but no matter what, without a physician on the premises, the Apricot Clinic will need to close its doors and suspend its business\u2026..\u201dSuddenly, Su Yi interjected, \u201cOur doors remain open. We can start accepting patients right now.\u201dHu Quan and the others were dumbfounded.Su Yi tapped his fingers against his desk and said, \u201cWe\u2019re just treating the ordinary ailments of the common folk. I can do that too.\u201d\u201cPff!\u201d One of the servants couldn\u2019t help but laugh. The others wore strange expressions on their faces; it was clear they took Su Yi\u2019s words as a joke.Huang Qianjun\u2019s expression darkened, and he shouted, \u201cWhat the hell are you laughing at? Hurry and call in the patients lined up outside!\u201dHe had blind faith in Su Yi.\u201cThen we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the esteemed Wen Family Son-in-law\u2019s medical attainments with our own eyes,\u201d said Hu Quan flatly. He ordered the two servants to open the doors and allow the patients inside.Before long, a white-haired old woman walked up to the counter. Her gaze swept around the clinic. \u201cWhere is Doctor Wu Guangbin?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d said Su Yi from behind the counter. \u201cI can treat you instead.\u201dBut the old woman merely glanced at him, shook her head, then turned to leave.When Hu Quan and the others saw this, their expressions turned even stranger. They planned to just sit back and watch this farce play out.Su Yi didn\u2019t mind in the least. \u201cNext.\u201dA man so stalwart, he looked as if he\u2019d forged out of iron walked in. When he learned that Wu Guangbin wasn\u2019t on the premises, he shook his head in disappointment.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he say so earlier?\u201d he spat. \u201cYou wasted my time!\u201dWith that, he turned to leave.\u201cSir, you\u2026.\u201d Hu Quan repressed his laughter and spoke up. The way he saw it, if things continued like this, Su Yi would only embarrass himself.\u201cNext!\u201d Su Yi said flatly, without the slightest change in expression.\u201cBrother Su, I\u2019ll call them in.\u201dHuang Qianjun was a natural-born henchman. When he saw the situation, he turned and charged out of the Apricot Clinic.Outside, he saw that the line had shrunk; more than half of the would-be patients had left.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry and leave! Doctor Wu isn\u2019t in.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the Apricot Clinic thinking? They\u2019re letting the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law treat patients? They\u2019ve gone mad!\u201d\u2026..The crowd broke into discussion, and one person left after another.This is no good! It\u2019s Brother Su\u2019s first day on the job. How can he just sit around kicking his heels? As his subordinate, if I let this go on, won\u2019t it make me look inept?\u00a0Huang Qianjun\u2019s expression turned ruthless. He walked down the stone steps, and his gaze swept across the patients who\u2019d yet to leave.\u201cHey! Stay in line, people! If anyone dares leave without authorization, don\u2019t blame me for my bad manners!\u201d he said coldly.The patients were practically all ordinary folk. The sight of a delinquent silkpants like Huang Qianjun struck terror in their hearts, and none of them dared leave.\u201cYou! Go on in!\u201d Huang Qianjun pointed to a thin, sallow-faced old man.\u201cI\u2026.\u201d The man seemed frantic, and inwardly, he cried out in duress.\u201cOld-timer, having my Brother Su treat you is a blessing from your ancestors,\u201d said Huang Qianjun viciously. \u201cDon\u2019t be ungrateful!\u201dThe old man grimaced, then hung his head and walked inside, as if he\u2019d lost his soul.When Hu Quan and the others saw this, they couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads.\u00a0This delinquent young master is being deliberately provocative for no good reason. Since when do you have to threaten patients to see a doctor?When he walked in, the old man smiled bitterly. \u201cDoctor Su, I\u2019m perfectly fine. I don\u2019t need medical care at all, so\u2026. Might you just let me go?\u201dSu Yi shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d The old-man straightened his back and denied it.\u201cYes, you are.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really not!\u201d The old man was practically in tears.Hu Quan almost burst into laughter.\u00a0Look at this! How absurd!Su Yi rose, walked up to the old man, and said, \u201cRecently, you\u2019ve been having violent coughing fits at night. You\u2019re fatigued, and you regularly have chills and severe pain. Am I right?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d The man was stunned, too stunned to be anxious.\u201dHu Quan and the others looked at Su Yi in mild surprise.Diagnosing patients came down to sight, sound, taking a medical history, and direct examination.Even Wu Guangbin, who\u2019d spent his whole life immersed in the art of medicine, had to at least ask a patient their symptoms and take their pulse to understand their illness.Yet now, without doing anything at all, Su Yi had seen through the old man\u2019s symptoms almost instantaneously!\u201cThere\u2019s a problem with your lungs. That combined with old age has resulted in your current symptoms.\u201dWith the memories of his past life, treating the common maladies of ordinary folk was simple as could be.After a brief daze, the old man suddenly grew agitated, and his voice shook. \u201cThen how should I treat my illness, Young Lord Su?\u201dHis gaze carried a thread of burning hope.Su Yi returned to his desk, took out a pen and paper, and wrote a simple prescription. He passed it to the nearest servant. \u201cGo fetch his medicine.\u201dThe servant accepted the paper, only to hesitate.\u201cLet me see.\u201d Hu Quan stepped forward, and after a brief inspection, he sunk into thought. A long time passed before he calmed back down.He wasn\u2019t a doctor, but he\u2019d worked at the Apricot Clinic for years. He knew at a glance that this prescription was the work of an experienced physician. It was similar to how ministers, despite lacking kingdoms of their own, understood the ways of kings.A moment later, Hu Quan passed the prescription to the servant. \u201cGo fetch this gentleman his medicine.\u201dThen, he turned to Su Yi, took a deep breath, and said solemnly, \u201cSir, I apologize for underestimating your abilities earlier and hope you can forgive me.\u201dWhen the others saw this, they were stunned.Hu Quan was the steward, and his status was high, second only to the manager.Yet shockingly, Su Yi\u2019s casually written prescription managed to convince him!Su Yi said flatly, \u201cIt\u2019s just a prescription, not much at all. Next!\u201dHuang Qianjun was still standing in the doorway, and he reacted immediately. \u201cYou! Get in here!\u201dThis time, a pale-faced man walked in, his expression wracked with agony.Su Yi took one look at him, then took a silver needle from a nearby drawer. Before the man could even react, he\u2019d\u00a0pricked\u00a0several acupoints all over his arm.An instant later, the man\u2019s agonized expression faded, replaced with surprise and delight. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore! I\u2019ve visited more than ten clinics already, but none of them were of any use. I would never have guessed that Young Lord Su could fix the problem with just a few needle pricks!\u201d The man waved his arm repeatedly in excitement and delight.Despite themselves, Hu Quan and the others were impressed, and their expressions filled with shock. The way they looked at Su Yi changed dramatically.Treating wounds with acupuncture?Who would have thought that the family\u2019s low-status live-in son-in-law had such a trick up his sleeves?\u201cAcupuncture fixed the symptoms, but not the root cause. You\u2019ll need a few doses of medicine as well.\u201d Su Yi wrote out a prescription and passed it over.This time, the servant was incomparably quick. He rushed straight off to fetch the designated medicines.\u201cNext.\u201d\u201cNext.\u201d\u201cNext.\u201d\u2026..the following interval completely turned into Su Yi\u2019s solo performance.When a patient walked in, he saw through both their symptoms and the root cause of the problem at a glance, without so much as a single question. Without exception, the patients were stunned and fully convinced of his abilities.Then, it was just a matter of writing a prescription, fetching medicine, and accepting payment\u2026From beginning to end, Su Yi was expressionless, as if he were an emotionless medical puppet.Hu Quan and the rest of the clinic\u2019s staff were simply dumbfounded.In all their years of life, they\u2019d never seen anyone treat patients like this before!This resulted in an enormous commotion outside the Apricot Clinic too.As one patient after another left the clinic, word spread. In the end, there was no longer any need for Huang Qianjun\u2019s threats. The patients outside clustered together, fighting for a chance to have Su Yi treat them.Seeing this lively, bustling crowd, Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but cluck his tongue.\u00a0Brother Su doesn\u2019t disappoint! Even his life-saving medical skills are so impressive!Seth's ThoughtsTo the best of my knowledge, we're planning a mass release.... probably later this month, when the novel launches for real. This is the last chapter I'm uploading until I get the official go-ahead. Expect an official launch soon! I can't give you a specific timeline yet, though. Probably around the middle of august, but it could be as late as September depending on the situation at WW.Thanks to everyone who's read this far, and I hope you'll stick around after our official launch!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - The Ghost in the CourtyardTime flew by.Finally, the number of patients waiting for care dwindled.Su Yi rubbed his forehead. He inadvertently glanced to the side, only to see that one of the servants had already brewed a steaming pot of medicinal tea for him.\u201cSir, have some water to moisten your throat,\u201d said the servant. He was humble and respectful.Hu Quan and the others smiled when they saw this.By now, the Apricot Clinic\u2019s old-hands were fully convinced of Su Yi\u2019s abilities.Their shock was more than words could express.Huang Qianjun stood not far away. He\u2019d witnessed their change in attitude firsthand, and waves coursed through his heart.\u00a0Only true skill can wholeheartedly convince others.He vaguely understood why his father had been so insistent that he find an opportunity to spend more time with Su Yi.At first, the staff of the Apricot Clinic had been arrogant and rude, with an air of superiority.Yet now, all of them had lowered their heads in submission!Had Su Yi forced them into submission?No, he\u2019d used his nigh-miraculous attainments in medicine, wordlessly convincing everyone present!Su Yi picked up the teacup and took a sip. Only then did he address them. \u201cStarting today, I\u2019ll take up residence here.\u201dHu Quan immediately responded, \u201cSir, there\u2019s an unoccupied residence behind the clinic. I\u2019ll send someone to clean it and provide various basic daily necessities. Will you need servants to wash your clothes and make your tea or a chef to prepare your meals?\u201dSu Yi shook his head. \u201cNo need for that. Have them clean the rooms and get the courtyard in order. That\u2019ll be plenty.\u201dHu Quan nodded and made a mental note of this.\u00a0He\u2019d been the Apricot Clinic\u2019s steward to begin with, and he was responsible for all sorts of chores and trifles. Now that he was convinced of Su Yi\u2019s skill, he was willing to serve.\u201cGoing forward, you\u2019ll remain in charge of all of the Apricot Clinic\u2019s affairs,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cEveryone can continue their jobs as usual; I\u2019ll simply be responsible for expenses and revenue.\u201dHe certainly had no plans of spending all his time and energy on the clinic.\u00a0He thought about it, then added, \u201cOf course, if you encounter particularly confusing symptoms or life-threatening illnesses, you can call on me. Leave ordinary illnesses to our physicians.\u201dAs soon as he said this, a man so stalwart, he looked as if he\u2019d been forged of iron walked into the clinic.Hu Quan and the rest of the staff recognized him at a glance. He\u2019d been there when the clinic first opened its doors, but when he saw that Wu Guangbin wasn\u2019t present, he\u2019d cursed, turned, and left.Yet here it was again. He\u2019d come back.\u201cUm\u2026. Young Lord Su, I know I was rude earlier, but I hope you can forgive me.\u201d The man awkwardly clasped his fist and apologized.\u201cYou\u2019ve never married, right?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s expression was rather strange.The man hurriedly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dSu Yi took out a piece of paper, wrote a brief message, and passed it to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not sick. Follow these instructions and you\u2019ll make a full recovery within three months.\u201dThe stalwart man accepted the paper and glanced at it. Despite himself, he was confused. \u201c\u2018Refrain from\u2026\u2019 Uh, what does this character mean?\u201dDespite themselves, Hu Quan and the rest of the staff were curious. They gathered around, but when they saw Su Yi\u2019s \u201cprescription\u201d, every last one of them burst into laughter.\u201cBrother, this character is pronounced \u2018nong\u2019. It has the hand radical on the left, and the radicals for \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 on the right. Combined, you get\u2026.. Well, you ought to understand what I\u2019m getting at, right?\u201dHu Quan smiled ambiguously as he offered the man his advice.The man was stunned, but a moment later, realization hit him. His swarthy face flushed red, and he covered his face and fled in embarrassment.\u201cHahahaha\u2026.!\u201d Huang Qianjun finally understood. He clutched his gut and laughed. \u201cHe looks so big and strong, yet he likes \u2018one-handed self combat\u2019!\u201dHu Quan and the others laughed too, ambiguous smiles on their faces.All men understood this!After this little interlude, the atmosphere at the Apricot Clinic became far more harmonious, and the air was full of good cheer.When he saw that there weren\u2019t any more patients, Su Yi rose. \u201cTake me to my residence so I can have a look around.\u201dHu Quan hurriedly called two servants, who led the way. After passing through the clinic\u2019s back door, they quickly arrived at a clean, silent courtyard.At the same time, in a teahouse not far from the Apricot Clinic\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u201cElder Wu, look at this prescription he wrote! This combination of medicinal herbs and supplements is practically divinely inspired!\u201d sighed a middle-aged man.His name was Tan Feng, and he was one of the Apricot Clinic\u2019s physicians.Two others sat beside him. One was a white-haired elder, while the other was a dark-skinned, grim-faced man.The first was Wu Guangbin, a physician famed throughout the city.The other was called Wei Tong. Just like Tan Feng, he was one of the clinic\u2019s three practicing physicians.However, after learning that Su Yi, the live-in son-in-law, was to take over the clinic\u2019s management, all three of them had come up with excuses to skip work and hide in the teahouse. They planned to wait there and watch Su Yi get kicked out.None of them had anticipated that even after waiting for so long, no such thing had happened.On the contrary, the patients waiting outside the clinic each received a cure!This surprised all three physicians. They couldn\u2019t help but call some of the patients into the teahouse to press them for details.The result practically made them jump.\u00a0Su Yi, the overlooked, disrespected live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family, really was proficient in the medical arts!\u201cElder Wu, Su Yi\u2019s method for curing \u2018Echo Worms\u2019 really opened my eyes,\u201d sighed Wei Tong.One of the patients Su Yi treated had an unusual malady; every time he spoke, a voice within his stomach echoed every word, as if there were some malevolent entity hidden within his body.But Su Yi said that the patient had inadvertently eaten an Echo Worm. He then picked up a Pharmacopeia and had the patient read each medicine\u2019s name out loud.\u00a0Every time the patient read an ingredient\u2019s name, the worm in his stomach repeated it.But when the patient said the word \u201comphalia grass\u201d, the voice within its stomach remained silent.Su Yi then immediately ordered a servant to fetch a stalk of omphalia grass and have the patient swallow it. This cured the patient on the spot, as the man coughed up a fingernail-sized bug\u2014the Echo Worm.Tan Feng sighed along with him. \u201cAlso, the way he used silver needles to treat that patient\u2019s arm was entirely unexpected! Even now, I can\u2019t figure out how he pulled it off!\u201dWu Guangbin had been quiet all this time, but he suddenly rose to his feet and strode towards Apricot Clinic.\u201cElder Wu, what are you doing?\u201d Tan Feng and Wu Tong hurriedly rose as well.\u201cI\u2019m naturally going to apologize!\u201d said Wu Guangbin without so much as a second look.Tan Feng and Wei Tong glanced at each other, then hurried after him.\u2026\u2026The residence behind the clinic.Three stand-alone, grey-tiled rooms surrounded a courtyard in the shape of the character \u201c\u54c1\u201d. One side had a vegetable bed and pergola, and there was a mighty locust tree in the center. A well stood beside it, but the metal was flecked with rust, and chains kept it completely sealed.No one had lived there in a long time, so the entire residence was covered in dust and spiderwebs, and the courtyard was full of weeds.It was almost noon, and the sun was blazing hot.Hu Quan commanded two servants to sweep up and add various accouterments.Su Yi, meanwhile, stood beneath the locust tree and surveyed the courtyard. His brow furrowed slightly.\u201cSir, the courtyard has been in disrepair for years, but once we get everything in order, it should be comfortable and convenient,\u201d said Hu Quan with a smile.\u201cHas anything bad happened here before?\u201d asked Su Yi, seemingly out of nowhere.Hu Quan froze, scrunched up his brow in thought, then said, \u201cNow that you mention it, yes. I recall one such incident.\u201cIt was about nine years ago. One of our clinic\u2019s physicians lived here, as well as two apprentice apothecaries. But then, one night, all three of them died suddenly.\u201d Hu Quan pointed to the sealed well. \u201cThe physician drowned within the well, but when they pulled up his corpse, his flesh had rotted off. The two apprentices\u2019 corpses were nothing but shriveled skins, and they were hanging from the branches of that locust tree.As he spoke, Hu Quan pointed to the tree at the center of the courtyard.Su Yi\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cShriveled hides? Were their flesh and organs nowhere to be found?\u201dHu Quan was shocked. \u201cHow did you know?\u201dSu Yi didn\u2019t explain. \u201cThe residence has been in disrepair ever since, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone says it\u2019s haunted\u2026 Uh, sir, it\u2019s not that I want to force you to live here, but this is the clinic\u2019s only residence,\u201d Hu Quan hurriedly explained, feeling a bit frantic.Su Yi smiled. \u201cNo harm done. Way I see it, this place looks pretty good.\u201dHuang Qianjun said ingratiatingly, \u201cBrother Su, won\u2019t you be lonely all by yourself in such a large residence? How about I arrange for some beauties to accompany you? I guarantee both their looks and personalities will satisfy you!\u201dSu Yi smiled faintly, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m that degenerate?\u201d\u201cHow could I?\u201d Huang Qianjun broke into cold sweats and immediately denied it. \u201cBrother Su, don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201dHe\u2019d just tried to butter Su Yi up, only to realize that he\u2019d used too much force.To his relief, Su Yi merely thought for a moment, then said, \u201cThere is actually something you can help me with. Go to the market and fetch me a rooster, the fiercer the better. Also, I need some fresh-cut willow branches and a three-foot-long piece of tempered ten-year peach wood.\u201dWhat does he need that stuff for?\u00a0Although he found it strange, the opportunity to do something for Su Yi filled him with delight. He immediately turned and scampered off. \u201cBrother Su, please wait a bit. I\u2019ll be right back!\u201dHis words echoed through the courtyard, but Huang Qianjun had already disappeared.Hu Quan couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u00a0That Huang Qianjun is an infamous hoodlum young master, yet he\u2019s obeying the Wen Family son-in-law\u2019s every whim. He\u2019s really expanded my horizons.\u201cSir, what do you need all that stuff for?\u201d\u00a0Hu Quan was curious too.\u00a0A rooster, peach wood, willow branches\u2026. Don\u2019t the wandering Daoist priests use those to exorcize ghosts? Does he think the residence is haunted?As soon as this possibility occurred to him, Hu Quan\u2019s heart shook.A ghost!Ghosts weren\u2019t at all unfamiliar to the people of Guangling City. There were countless rumors and elaborate tales of vicious ghosts emerging from Mother Ghost Ridge!\u201cI\u2019m preparing just in case.\u201d Su Yi didn\u2019t explain any further.It was then that three figures hurried into the courtyard. When the white-haired elder at the front of the group saw Su Yi, he bowed on the spot. \u201cThis humble one is Wu Guanglin. I am ashamed, and have come to apologize!\u201dWhen Tan Feng and Wei Tong saw this, they hurriedly followed suit.Su Yi glanced at them, then instantly understood. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, so you have nothing to apologize for. This matter ends here. Going forward, the three of you will continue to hold down the Apricot Clinic. You can get up, but I hope this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201dThe three physicians sighed in relief.Hu Quan was happy too. \u201cI won\u2019t hide it; our new manager might be young, but his medical attainments are superb. You didn\u2019t see it, but\u2026\u201dOnce he started, he kept going, enraptured as he told them all about how Su Yi treated the day\u2019s patients.\u00a0There were numerous details that even the three physicians didn\u2019t understand, but they too were entranced, and their hearts filled with longing.By the time Hu Quan finished, their gaze turned respectful whenever they looked at Su Yi.Seth's ThoughtsWe're officially launched! Welcome to all new readers, and thanks to everyone who's followed this all the way through the sneak peak phase!So.1) The character referenced here is \u201c\u630a\u201d, which is a variant of the more common \u201c\u5f04\u201c. In most situations, it\u2019s a pretty generic verb. It means \u201cto do\u201d, \u201cget\u201d, \u201cmake\u201d, or \u201cplay.\u201d However, this particular variant is a bit more\u2026 visually evocative?Hand is written \u201c\u624b\u201d by itself, or \u201c\u624c\u201d when its a component of other characters.Up is \u201c\u4e0a\u201d.Down is \u201c\u4e0b\u201d.Combined, you get \u201c\u630a\u201d\uff0cor \u201cto move the hands up and down.\u201d2) \u2018One-handed self combat\u2019 is a reference to Zhou Botong\u2019s \u201ctechnique of ambidexterity\u201d in Jin Yong\u2019s classic novel, \u201cThe Legend of Condor Heroes.\u201d Zhou Botong created it out of boredom. This mysterical art allows each hand to use different martial arts, allowing him to fight himself.I know the translation looks a bit different from mine, but \u201ctechnique of ambidexterity\u201d was likely chosen for clarity or reader appeal; \u53cc\u624b\u4e92\u640f literally translates to \u201ctwo hands fighting each other.\u201d The only difference between the terms is the number of hands\u2026.3) Echo Bugs, \u5e94\u58f0\u866b, are a creature of folklore. In the modern language, the phrase refers to yes-men, but it originally referred to an insect that lived inside people and repeated everything it heard, and that\u2019s what it refers to here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - A Ghost Among TreesIn the afternoon, the sun-baked courtyard was warm and comfortable.\u00a0Su Yi sat in a bamboo chair, tying the green willow branches into a bundle.The servants had finished sweeping, and the residence was clean and spacious.\u00a0Hu Quan was still scrupulously supplying him with bedding, toiletries, and other necessities, in addition to improving the pergola and vegetable beds.\u00a0The three physicians had already returned to the clinic to resume seeing patients.Only Su Yi, the manager, was taking it easy.\u201cBrother Su, what\u2019s the rooster for?\u201d Not far off, Huang Qianjun was teasing the rooster he\u2019d bought to alleviate his boredom.The bird was vicious, with sharp claws and a pointed beak. It moved like the wind, and its cry was sonorous.\u00a0Huang Qianjun had led about a dozen attendants to scour the market before finding this proud, haughty rooster.\u201cKill it and drain its blood,\u201d Su Yi ordered casually.Today\u2019s experience taught him how nice it was to have someone around to take care of miscellaneous tasks. It could save him a lot of time and energy.\u201cAlright!\u201d Huang Qianjun pulled a knife from his waist and got to work.Not long after, he presented Su Yi with a bowl of fresh red rooster blood.\u201cGood. That\u2019s it for today. You can go home now.\u201d Su Yi picked up the bundled willow branches and dipped their tips into the bowl. The bright red juxtaposed the green leaves, the sight jarring to the eye.Huang Qianjun hesitated, then said, \u201cBrother Su, the way I see it, once Wen Changqing finds out you kicked out everyone loyal to him, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll just let it go. Should I have my father give him a warning?\u201dSu Yi glanced at him. \u201cIf you really want to help, you can ask around and find out where the best blacksmith in Guangling City is.\u201dHuang Qianjun instantly perked up. \u201cBrother Su, that couldn\u2019t be easier! Our Huang Family has a monopoly on the city\u2019s weapons trade. Master weaponsmiths? We have over thirty of them! If you need something forged, just say it. I guarantee you the best weaponsmith around!\u201dSu Yi finally remembered; of the city\u2019s Three Great Clans, the Wen Family monopolized the medicinal herb trade, the Li Family monopolized the sale of grain and other foodstuffs, while the Huang Family monopolized the weapons and metal tools business.\u201cI plan to forge a sword,\u201d said Su Yi.Huang Qianjun instantly smiled. \u201cA sword? Then you need Wang Tianyang. Ol\u2019 Wang\u2019s skill at forging blades is second to none in Guangling City. People come even from outside the city just to have him forge them a quality sword.\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cCome here tomorrow morning and take me to see him.\u201dHuang Qianjun instantly nodded. \u201cBrother Su, is there anything else?\u2019When it came to working for Su Yi, he was as enthusiastic as could be.\u201cYou can go home.\u201d Su Yi waved him away.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning.\u201d Only then did Huang Qianjun turn to leave.He was conscientious, and he knew that sticking to Su Yi like glue would only irritate him.\u00a0It was like how, when he visited brothels, nothing was more irritating than the attendants his father had\u00a0accompany\u00a0him\u2026.After submerging the bundle of willow branches in rooster blood, Su Yi picked up a knife and started hacking away at the three-foot piece of peach wood.\u00a0As fine wood shavings piled up, a wooden sword gradually took shape.Su Yi rose from his bamboo chair, held the peach wood sword up to his face, and examined it. He nodded in satisfaction. \u201cNow I just have to wait for nightfall.\u201dSu Yi casually waved the sword about, then took another look at the willow branches soaking in rooster blood.His gaze shifted, then landed on the nearby locust tree. Locusts were like ghosts among tree\u00a0kind!They had a natural yin affinity, so they had an easier time beckoning and housing ghosts and other wicked beings than any other tree.The key issue with the courtyard\u2019s layout was that they\u2019d excavated a well directly beside the locust tree. When\u00a0dark yin energy\u00a0surged from underground, it was inevitable that it would transform the residence into what the common folk saw as a \u201chaunted house.\u201dThe well has clearly been sealed. It seems someone has long since noticed that there\u2019s something wrong with it.\u00a0But despite all that, no one told me any of this\u2026.Su Yi seemed lost in thought.\u2026\u2026The Wen Family, Wen Changqing\u2019s residence.\u201cFather, I just received word that Su Yi, that good-for-nothing, has only managed the Apricot Clinic for a single day, yet he\u2019s already kicked out every last one of our subordinates. How is that any different from spitting in our family\u2019s face?\u201d Wen Jieyuan said in a huff.He was Wen Changqing\u2019s son, and he was nineteen this year, a spirited youth at the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm\u2019s Refining Muscle Stage. In half a year, he\u2019d head to Blueriver Sword Manor to continue his cultivation.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed that waste would be so ruthless.\u201d Wen Changqing furrowed his brow. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201dWen Jieyuan said, \u201cThey say he\u2019s taken up residence in the haunted manor behind Apricot Clinic.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Wen Changqing\u2019s eyes filled with surprise, and his furrowed brow relaxed. \u201cIn that case, there\u2019s no need for us to do anything. That waste won\u2019t live through the night!\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Wen Jieyuan was stunned.Wen Changqing thought back, then said, \u201cNine years ago, a gruesome incident occurred there. The doctor and two apprentices living there perished overnight, all three dying bizarre deaths. This incident caused uproar throughout the city, and it had a severe impact on the Apricot Clinic\u2019s business.\u201cI spent an enormous sum to hire a famous wandering Daoist priest. His name was Wu Ruoqiu, and as soon as he entered the haunted house, he said that a malevolent apparition had occupied the well beside the locust tree!\u201cThe Daoist said that no one beneath the Grandmaster level could possibly defeat it!\u201dWen Jieyuan was startled. \u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d\u201cDaoist Wu had me forge a chain,\u201d said Wen Changqing. \u201cThen, he used a mysterious and secretive art to seal the well off. Unless a living human takes up residence within the courtyard, the ghost will not appear again.\u201dWhen Wen Jieyuan heard that, he instantly understood. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that if Su Yi spends the night there, he\u2019s doomed?\u201dWen Changqing laughed. \u201cAlmost certainly. I\u2019ve wondered why the matriarch was so insistent on having Lingzhao marry Su Yi ever since their marriage, but no matter her reasoning, if Su Yi dies, it\u2019ll be good for the entire family.\u201dWen Jieyuan nodded repeatedly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Cousin Lingzhao is about to become a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple. How could a waste like Su Yi be worthy of her? His death will benefit her too.\u201dWen Changqing\u2019s expression suddenly turned serious. \u201cYou are not to leak this information to anyone else. If others find out that we were well aware of the residence\u2019s problems but chose not to warn Su Yi, we\u2019ll be implicated by his death.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d said Wen Jieyuan with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s brought this on himself. Does he really think he can obtain the Apricot Clinic so easily? Now that I think about it, the one who really killed him was his mother-in-law, Qin Qing, not us.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be impudent!\u201d rebuked Wen Changqing. \u201cShe\u2019s your aunt and Lingzhao\u2019s mother. You\u2019d best be more respectful going forward!\u201dWen Jieyuan nodded dismissively....Night gradually drew near.After a full day\u2019s work, the Apricot Clinic finally extinguished its lights and closed its doors.Su Yi sat alone within one of the residence\u2019s three rooms, breathing and circulating his blood and qi to repeatedly temper his connective tissue.\u00a0This was the breathing technique for the Blood Circulation Realm\u2019s third layer, \u201cRefining Sinew.\u201dRefining Sinew referred to using the qi and blood to refine the body\u2019s fascia, tendons, and ligaments, making them as tough as bowstrings and soft as cotton. This process made you as flexible as a civet.\u201cRising like an arrow, falling like the wind, moving like a civet.\u201d All of these were difficult for ordinary people. They key lay in \u201cRefining Sinew.\u201dUpon tempering their connective tissue, a cultivator\u2019s strength would go up another level.When it came to Blood Circulation Realm cultivation, everyone knew that \u201cRefining skin and flesh is easy, but refining sinew and bone is difficult.\u201d This\u00a0had\u00a0been common knowledge since ancient times. Beginning the Refining Sinew stage was equivalent to entering the late-stage Blood Circulation Realm.After a while, Su Yi rose from the lotus position, drained the cup of ginseng tea he\u2019d prepared in advance, and sensed the baking heat throughout his body. His strength seemed to boil over. Despite himself, he was looking forward to tonight\u2019s operation.He hadn\u2019t really engaged in combat since reincarnating.Who would have guessed that his first opponent would be a ghost?Next, he picked up the bundle of willow branches and the peach wood sword and left the room. He moved the chair, picked a spot at random, and sat on the stone steps.The willow branches had been soaking in rooster blood for hours, and the green leaves were dyed with faint tinges of red. When he held the bundle, it felt like a soft whip.The peach wood sword, he leaned against the bamboo chair.When he needed to draw his blade, it meant he needed to go all out.Were I an ordinary Blood Circulation cultivator, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d be no match for even an ordinary ghost. However, in my past life, I once fought the Ghost Emperor of the Western Seas. He was willing to gamble, and he made good on his promises; when I won, he gave me a copy of \u2018the Ten Directions Asura Sutra.\u2019 They say it's the ultimate Daoist sutra in the eyes of ghost cultivators\u2026.\u00a0As Su Yi sat there, his thoughts raced.A night breeze blew past, and the skies grew darker and darker.It was late, and lamps went out throughout the streets of Guangling City. The darkness was like a tide submerging the earth.\u00a0This was a lull amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. The people sank into slumber, the streets silent save for the occasional distant howling of dogs.Tonight, layers of dense, dark clouds blotted out the starlight. Within the courtyard, all was dark save for the flickering light of the candle he\u2019d placed within his room, but through the paper curtain, it was dull and indistinct.Su Yi clenched his bundle of willow branches and stood silently within the darkness of the night. He was calm and unhurried, tranquil and at ease.Except, there was a hint of anticipation in his gaze.Suddenly, the locust tree\u2019s branches rattled, rustling the leaves. Against the darkness of the night, it was like a series of whispered conversations near and far.The rust-flecked chains sealing the well shifted and rubbed together like a nest of snakes. The sound was reminiscent of a hooting owl, and it sent a chill down one\u2019s spine.\u00a0The temperature of the surrounding air plummeted, like the sudden onset of winter, bone-chillingly cold.Whoosh~!Leaves fell from the locust tree and hit the ground. As soon as they landed, sinister winds carried them into the air. They fluttered about, drops of ink against the night sky, like countless shadows in a frenzied dance.The winds rustled Su Yi\u2019s blue robe, and his eyes narrowed.As the leaf-laden wind swept towards him, he finally took action.He raised his right hand and shook his wrist.The bundle of soft willow branches straightened and cracked like a whip, emitting a faint, bloody glow against the darkness.Whap!The sound was crisp, going off like a sudden crack of thunder.Seth's ThoughtsJust to clarify: \u201cWen Jieyuan\u201d is not a typo. This is a different person from Wen Jueyuan. Wen Jieyuan is (Second Elder) Wen Changqing\u2019s son, while Wen Jueyuan is (Family Head) Wen Changjing\u2019s son.\u2026.I know the names are really similar. I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t name them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Qing WanAmidst the tranquility of the night, the cluster of willow branches swung like a whip, leaving a trail of faint, bloody light in the air.Crack!An indistinct, airborne figure staggered back, shrieking in agony. They were ethereal and illusory, and they were enveloped in dense yin energy. A ghost!\u201cOne hit and you\u2019re already screaming in pain? How\u00a0anticlimactic.\u201d Su Yi had already risen to his feet, and when he saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. The anticipation in his eyes faded.Whoosh! Whoosh!The locust tree shook violently, its countless branches dancing in the wind, the gales howling like banshees and stirring up the fallen leaves. Then, both the wind and the ghost charged at Su Yi once more.Su Yi clutched his cluster of willow branches as if it were a divine whip. Rather than retreating, he advanced.Crack!The sound resounded like thunder with a burst of bloody light. The clustered branches split, striking like countless laser whips.The ghost couldn\u2019t dodge in time. It rattled, then billowed with black smoke, staggering back and shrieking in agony.Despite himself, Su Yi\u2019s eyes filled with disappointment.The willow branches he carried had merely been dipped in a bit of rooster blood. Although they countered ghosts and other forces of darkness, they weren\u2019t exactly \u201cpowerful\u201d.Who would have thought that this ghost would be so weak\u2026.?Crack!As he pondered, Su Yi struck once more.This time, the ghost seemed unable to hold out any longer. The yin qi surrounding it burst, leaving the ghost\u00a0within behind. A petite figure fell from the sky.She was a woman!The ghost wore a red dress, and she looked young. Her skin was white as snow, and she was in the fetal position, her petite frame trembling violently and her big eyes wracked with agony.\u201cMystic Master, please, spare me! I\u2019ve never hurt anyone before!\u201d The girl in the red dress lay there, begging for mercy and panting for breath.She was an extraordinary, picturesque beauty, with faint dimples. There was still a bit of baby fat on her face, but she looked certain to blossom into a first-class beauty.However, her figure was indistinct, and she wasn\u2019t solid, which made her seem ethereal.Su Yi clenched his willow branches and stared down at her. He sighed. \u201cSo, the ghost haunting this place was just a bottom-class yin soul\u2026\u201dGhosts were divided into four simple categories: yin souls, haunts, specters, and phantasms.Of them, yin souls were the lowest class. They were the weakest, as well as the most common. Of the countless ghost stories spread amongst the common folk, the majority were of yin souls.In Su Yi\u2019s eyes, all the world\u2019s remnant spirits, vengeful souls, and vicious ghosts all fell into the \u201cyin soul\u201d category.After all, how capable could a ghost that only dared haunt the mortal world be?Truly powerful apparitions dared contend with cultivators for territory and declare themselves kings!\u201cHave you been possessing that old locust tree all this time?\u201d asked Su Yi. He could see at a glance that the red-dressed yin soul wasn\u2019t vicious or bloodthirsty. On the contrary, she looked pristine and pure.This meant she\u2019d never hurt anyone before.\u201cThat\u2019s indeed the case, Mystic Master,\u201d replied the ghost timidly. Her beautiful face was pallid, and she looked meek and obedient as she huddled and shook in abject terror. It was hard not to pity her.\u201cThat can\u2019t be right. You\u2019re lying.\u201d Su Yi frowned.If not her, just who had killed that physician and those two apprentices nine years ago?Before the ghost in the red dress could respond, something changed.Swoosh!A streak of black glinting with cold light, like a laser, shot towards Su Yi, emanating a malevolent, murderous air.\u201cThere really is something going on here.\u201d A hint of a cold smile tugged at Su Yi\u2019s lips, and his hands shifted casually.He jabbed straight ahead with the willow branches, as if they were a sword.Bang!One attack, and he struck that streak of black with perfect accuracy. The black light trembled violently, then fell to the ground. After a brief struggle, it ceased moving.When Su Yi took a closer look, he saw that it was a black insect about the size of an infant\u2019s fist. It had six legs, and its mouthparts were like densely concentrated sharp blades. It was hideous and malevolent looking, and it reeked of rotting flesh.\u201cGhoul Worms! So it was them.\u201d When Su Yi saw this, he realized something. He glanced at the ghost in the red dress. \u201cWho refined them, and who\u2019s controlling them now?\u201dGhoul Worms were a poisonous insect made from refined ghosts and corpses. Their bodies brimmed with corpse poison and malevolent energy.If an ordinary person was bitten, their bodies would burst and they\u2019d die on the spot. Even a Blood Circulation martial artist could only hold out an hour at most.Although Ghoul Worms weren\u2019t enough to scare Su Yi, whoever refined and controlled them was worth taking seriously! That\u2019s what really concerned him.\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d The lady ghost hesitated, her face filled with terror and dread. It seemed she didn\u2019t dare tell him.But it was then that\u2026The rusted chains sealing off the well beside the tree shook violently, and the lid shifted, opening just a crack.Immediately afterward, a cluster of black lights streamed out like a dark cloud, blotting out the skies as they surged towards Su Yi.A swarm of Ghoul Worms!There were over a hundred of them, and they emitted piercing shrieks from their hideous, sharp mouths, like a chorus of wailing ghosts. Their dark, malevolent yin energy swept across the entire courtyard.When she saw this, the girl in the red dress seemed to despair. She buried her head, not daring to look.After all, that was over a hundred Ghoul Worms taking action at once. Any Blood Circulation Realm cultivator would have been scared out of their wits and fallen into despair.But Su Yi merely furrowed his brow, looking as calm and composed as ever.Suddenly, he took a deep breath and circulated his energy. The cluster of willow branches went as straight as a sword.With a sweep of his sleeves, he strode forward, wielding the branches like a blade. The branches turned in the air.Suddenly, they swept through the air like a river of stars, as if overturning and cleansing everything in their path.One sword to pull galaxies, overturn heaven and earth, and sweep across the mortal world.Boom!The shadowy worms filling the air all burst upon impact.The sound of explosions rang out, so concentrated, it was as if they\u2019d all burst in unison. It really did sound like a sudden crack of thunder, leaving nothing but ash behind!Since his reincarnation, this was the first time Su Yi had truly unleashed his sword.Although his cultivation was only in the Blood Circulation Realm, when his sword swept by, he was like an immortal cast down to earth, dancing with his shadow. With each swing of his sword, silence descended in all directions.Over a hundred Ghoul Worms, obliterated. Nothing but powder remained!Su Yi, meanwhile, stood within the courtyard, his lean figure like an unsheathed sword, penetrating right through the curtain of the night. This was in stark contrast with his usual aloof, transcendent calm.Outside of battle, he hid his edge like a sword in its scabbard, but when he attacked, he fully revealed his sharpness.Bang!Cracks spread along the willow branches. They shattered, scattering into fragments.After all, they were nothing but ordinary wicker. They couldn\u2019t withstand the force with which Su Yi swung his sword.The huddled yin soul finally dared raise her head, but when she saw this, it only made her even more terrified.Obliterating a hundred Ghoul Worms in a single blow? That was just too scary!Suddenly, the locust tree at the center of the courtyard stilled. Its leaves no longer rustled in the wind, and there were no further movements from the well beside it.The night sky was placid as water. Tranquility descended upon the courtyard, and everything seemed just as it had been before.\u00a0Su Yi bent and sat back in his bamboo chair, his peach wood sword horizontally in front of him. His presence silently returned to normal.He glanced at the huddling girl in the red dress. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance. Tell me where you came from, and everything you know. If your answer satisfies me, I\u2019ll leave you a chance at survival.\u201dHis tone was casual, but the girl quivered in fright. It was undeniable that Su Yi terrified her.She calmed herself, then said softly and timidly, \u201cMystic Master, I\u2026.. I only remember that my name is Qing Wan. By the time I gained awareness, I\u2019d already been captured by a Daoist Priest named Wu Ruoqiu. He used a secret art to imprison me within the courtyard\u2019s locust tree and said that so long as I obeyed him, he\u2019d release me.\u201cWu Ruoqiu? What did he bind a weak, practically\u00a0useless yin soul\u00a0like you for?\u201dQing Wan lowered her head, then grimaced. \u201cHe wanted me to scare people away. He said that whenever a living person entered the courtyard, I was to scare them off. Then, the Ghoul Worms he raised would emerge from the depths of the well and devour their terrified victim\u2019s blood essence.\u201dSu Yi finally understood.This courtyard was nothing but a \u201cworm farm\u201d the wandering Daoist Priest Wu\u00a0Ruoqiu\u00a0had set up!He was using living humans\u2019 blood essence to nourish his Ghoul Worms and make them transform.\u00a0The lady ghost, Qing Wan, was just responsible for scaring their victims\u2026From this, it seemed that Wu\u00a0Ruoqiu\u00a0was well aware that a low-class ghost like Qing Wan wasn\u2019t good for much.\u201cIt\u2019s been nine years, and this place has been abandoned. No one has lived here for a long time. Isn\u2019t Wu Ruoqiu worried that his Ghoul Worms will starve to death?\u201d asked Su Yi.Qing Wan shook her head. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen. He comes back every three days, and he always brings a couple of living people with him to toss into the well and feed the Ghoul Worms.\u201d\u201cWhen\u00a0was he\u00a0last here?\u201d asked Su Yi. It seemed something had just occurred to him.\u201cTwo days ago.\u201d As soon as Qing Wan said this, she realized the implications, and she seemed terrified. She stuttered, \u201cMystic Master, Daoist Wu will be here a few hours after midnight!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already just past midnight. Judging by the time, he\u2019ll be here before long.\u201d Su Yi gently caressed the peach wood sword lying in front of him, then muttered, \u201cDo you know his cultivation?\u201d\u201cI recall him once saying that he was in the Qi Accumulation Stage\u2019s \u2018Unblocking\u00a0Acupoints\u2019 stage, and that he could try advancing to \u2018Opening Meridians\u2019 within the year,\u201d said Qing Wan.The Four Realms of the Martial Dao were Blood Circulation, Qi Accumulation, Inner Furnace, and An\u0101srava.Qi Accumulation was the second realm of the Martial Dao, and it was subdivided into three stages: Unblocking Acupoints, Opening Meridians, and Astral Manifestation. They corresponded, respectively, to the early, middle, and late stages of the Qi Accumulation Realm.The likes of City Lord Fu Shan, the heads of Guangling City\u2019s Three Great Clans, and the commander of the Old Guard, Nie Beihu, in addition to several of the city\u2019s famed experts of the older generation, were all within this realm.\u201cA paltry figure at the Qi Accumulation Realm\u2019s Unblocking Acupoints stage? That\u2019ll be easier than I thought.\u201d Su Yi was increasingly calm. He thought it over, then said to the ghost, \u201cReturn to your locust tree and pretend you don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019ll decide what to do with you once I\u2019ve dealt\u00a0with that Wu\u00a0Ruoqiu.\u201d\u201cMystic Master, thank you for not killing me!\u201d Qing Wan was so worked up, she kowtowed. Only then did she manage enough courage to stand back up. Her blood red dress fluttered as she flew back to the locust tree, blinked, and disappeared.Su Yi sank into thought.With his peak Blood Circulation Realm, Refining Sinew stage cultivation, he\u2019d have to go all out to kill a Qi Accumulation Realm expert.But that was under normal circumstances. This was different; his opponent was a heretical cultivator, someone proficient in dark and sinister arts.Just in case, he\u2019d best be scrupulously cautious.As Su Yi leaned back into his bamboo chair and waited, he thought to himself,\u00a0It seems that this time, I\u2019ll have to reveal some of my hidden trump cards\u2026.Seth's ThoughtsYin souls, haunts, specters, and phantasms.While translating this, I put the four Chinese words I'm translating this into my dictionary/translation software to see what came up, and all four just came back as \"ghost\", so I had to get creative.There are differences, but if I'm being completely honest, I just came up with as many ghostly-sounding terms as I could, then picked based on a) ascending order based on my subjective perception of toughness and b)\u00a0how well they matched the \"vibe\" of the Chinese term. The term I translated as \"haunt\" has a bit more of a \"skulking thing that lurks in the night\" vibe to it, for instance, while the character for \"specter\" has the character for \"strange/freak/monster\" in it.The notable exception is \"yin soul\" which is a literal translation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - A Nearby Enemy is a Greater Threat than a Hostile NationThe night was deep and dark, and the locust tree was silent and still.Suddenly, a figure appeared on the wall surrounding the courtyard.In his dark robes, he was only dimly discernable. He was thin as bamboo, and he carried a human corpse in each hand.\u00a0With a swing of his arms, he flung both corpses into the courtyard. Then, he sprang into the air and landed beside them.\u201cEh? Qing Wan, is someone living here?\u201d It was so dark out that the Daoist had only just noticed that someone had swept the overgrown, long-abandoned courtyard. Everything looked fresh and new.Qing Wan said nothing. Su Yi\u2019s indifferent voice answered him in her place. \u201cWu Ruoqiu, you\u2019re finally here.\u201dHe rose from his bamboo chair, his right hand loosely gripping his peach wood sword. He stood in the darkness, silently staring at his opponent.Wu Ruoqiu looked like he was about forty years old. His complexion was pale and clear, with a willowy beard, a sword strapped to his back, and a yellow-skinned gourd at his waist. He looked as if he\u2019d transcended the world of the mundane.\u201cWho are you? Why do you know my name?\u201d Wu Ruoqiu was stunned, and he instantly went on guard.As soon as he spoke, he let out a strange, shrill whistle.But even after waiting for quite some time, the expected results never came.Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s heart sank, and he was a bit frantic.\u00a0What\u2019s going on? Where are they?\u201cI killed all the Ghoul Worms,\u201d said Su Yi, strolling towards him with complete confidence. \u201cYou can shout yourself hoarse if you like, but it won\u2019t do you any good.\u201d\u201cWho exactly are you?\u201d Wu Ruoqiu shouted. His eyes glinted sharply, and he readied himself for battle.\u201cDon\u2019t be in such a rush. Before we fight, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you.\u201d Su Yi was already standing just ten feet from Wu Ruoqiu.Only then did Wu Ruoqiu see him clearly and realize that he was dealing with a teenager. The tall, lean young man wore blue robes and held a wooden sword. From his aura, Wu Ruoqiu could tell he was still only in the Blood Circulation Realm.Wu Ruoqiu instantly relaxed, his gaze self-deprecating.\u00a0I\u2019m really turning into a coward. A mere Blood Circulation\u00a0Realm whelp practically\u00a0scared me out of my wits!He stood with his hands behind his back and said coldly, \u201cYoung man, you\u2019re still not qualified to discuss things with me. Go call for your master. I\u2019d like to ask him how he teaches his disciples. You clearly don\u2019t have any manners!\u201dHis connection with the Ghoul Worms in the well had been severed, and even Qing Wan was nowhere to be seen. This made Wu Ruoqiu suspect that there was an expert backing Su Yi.Su Yi laughed and shook his head. \u201cIf I met someone worthy of being my master, I might very well rejoice, but unfortunately\u2026. I\u2019ve yet to encounter such a person.\u201dWu Ruoqiu was stunned. He jeered, \u201cYou\u2019ve yet to even finish growing body hair, but you sure can talk! If you don\u2019t call for your master, don\u2019t blame me for my poor manners!\u201dThe glint in his eyes flashed, and his aura suddenly changed. He circulated his energy, and shockingly, a faint roar, like a surging tide, rang out.This was the power of the Qi Accumulation Realm.When a martial artist activated their power, their blood and qi gathered and flared up.By guiding your qi in battle, you could ensure that every movement was so precise, it was as if it had been measured with a ruler, not even a millimeter off. This represented an exquisite level of control over one\u2019s own power.Wu Ruoqiu was a Qi Accumulation Realm, Unblocking Acupoints stage cultivator. His skin was like bronze, his muscles like stones, his bones like iron, and his sinews like jade. Ordinary weapons could barely scratch him.A faint hint of mockery tugged at Su Yi\u2019s lips. \u201c\u2018Poor manners\u2019? I\u2019ll be interested to see just what an Unblocking Acupoints small fry\u2019s poor manners are like!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve traveled this world for a long time, and I\u2019ve seen my fair share of arrogance, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone as arrogant as you!\u201d Wu Ruoqiu laughed in anger.An \u2018Unblocking Acupoints small fry\u2019?Listen to him! Does he even know what he\u2019s saying?Wu Ruoqiu suddenly leaped forward, his sleeves billowing as he reached for Su Yi\u2019s neck.Boom!A Qi Accumulation Realm Expert attacked with all the force and speed of lightning, sharp and despotic. His momentum alone could scare Blood Circulation Realm cultivators out of their wits!Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s plan was simple. First, he\u2019d take Su Yi captive. Then, he\u2019d force the expert behind him out of hiding, putting himself in an unbeatable position.Seizing Su Yi was the task at hand.But then\u2026.A hint of an illusory sword flashed in the depths of Su Yi\u2019s gaze, and a vast, cold, terrifying presence surged forth.Boom!It was as if a bolt of lightning had struck Wu Ruqiu\u2019s spiritual sea. His mind throbbed, and everything went black. It was as if he\u2019d plummeted straight into the endless landscape of hell. A mysterious immortal blade flew in from beyond the heavens, shattering and suppressing destiny.At that moment, the four directions, the heavens above, and the ground below all brimmed with terrifying sword intent. The illusory sword hummed, filling his ears like the infuriated roaring of the gods.A feeling of insignificance, helplessness, despair, and terror rose within Wu Ruoqiu, dealing a devastating blow to his mental state. He almost collapsed.This feeling only lasted an instant.But after this shock, Wu Ruoqiu paused mid-charge. He was now exactly five steps away from Su Yi.Five steps. That was the standard distance for a life and death battle between martial artists.At five steps away, even an emperor would be hard-pressed to defend himself. At close quarters, a single man was more threatening than a hostile nation!When he was five steps away, Su Yi took action.It was just a simple stab.But it was fast! And accurate! And ruthless!It was as if he\u2019d drawn his sword countless times and were acting on pure instinct. His speed and precision were unmatched, as was his ruthlessness.Spurt!The dull wooden sword pierced right through Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s chest, shattering his ribs like rotten wood and coming out the other side.Fresh, hot blood dripped from the tip of the blade, pouring from the newly-opened hole in his back.The force of the blow was so sudden and violent that Wu Ruoqiu bent forward, like a prawn in boiling water. His eyes bulged, and he looked dazed, as if he dared not believe what was happening.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he rasped, \u201cAre you really in the Blood Circulation Realm?\u201d\u201cIndeed, I\u2019m the genuine article.\u201d Su Yi pulled the sword from the man\u2019s chest, then took three steps back.Wu Ruoqiu shook violently. Blood spurted from the wound like a geyser and poured down like a waterfall. If Su Yi hadn\u2019t dodged just in time, he would have been drenched.Thud!Wu Ruoqiu tumbled into the dirt, gasping for breath.His wounds were so severe that he could sense his life force slipping away.\u201cYou\u2026 Didn\u2019t you have something you wanted to ask me\u2026.? Why\u2026 Why did you strike so ruthlessly? If I die, you won\u2019t learn\u2026. Anything at all.\u201d Wu Ruoqiu struggled to speak. He truly didn\u2019t understand.\u201cOh,\u201d said Su Yi casually, \u201cI\u2019ve already lost interest in knowing.\u201d\u201c.....\u201d Wu Ruoqiu was so angry he hacked up a mouthful of blood. He gnashed his teeth and cried out hatefully, \u201cYou ruined my sect\u2019s master plan! Just you wait; they\u2019ll get their revenge!\u201dWith those final words, Wu Ruoqiu collapsed in the dirt and breathed no more. His eyes were still wide with resentment.He never would have guessed that one wrong move would lead to him falling at the hands of a Blood Circulation Realm teenager.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even endure a single imprint\u2019s aura.\u201d Su Yi shook his head. \u201cThe martial artists of the Great Zhou sure have weak souls\u2026.\u201dJust now, he\u2019d used a thread of the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2019 aura.It was just a single, miniscule wisp, yet it was more than a Qi Accumulation martial artist like Wu Ruoqiu could bear. It dealt a shock directly to his soul.Su Yi had seized the gap this momentary shock created to pierce right through his ribcage.\u201cIf I\u2019d known it would be this easy, I would have faced him directly. It might have been a bit more trouble, but my current cultivation combined with my attainments in the Dao of the Sword would have been enough to kill him.\u201dSu Yi had assumed that since Wu Ruoqiu was a heretical cultivator, he was sure to have mastered numerous dark and sinister arts. That was why he chose not to clash with him head on. Instead, he\u2019d expended some of his cultivation to call upon one of his trump cards.Who would have thought that his foe would rely purely on his cultivation to attack? He hadn\u2019t used any dark or secret arts at all!\u201cIt seems I took the heretical cultivators of the mundane world too seriously,\u201d Su Yi said with an air of self-mockery.Looking back on it, it wasn\u2019t that Wu Ruoqiu was stupid. It was just that as a Qi Accumulation Realm expert, he\u2019d underestimated his Blood Circulation Realm opponent right from the start.Clearly, looking weak was actually an advantage; it made foes careless and complacent.\u201cDo you know which sect Wu Ruoqiu belonged to?\u201d Su Yi glanced at the nearby locust tree.\u201cMystic Master, I\u2026 I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know.\u201d A panicked, shadowy red figure appeared upon one of its branches.Her hands fidgeted with the hem of her dress, and she lowered her head. Her little face, still slightly chubby with baby-fat, looked tiny, helpless, and pitiful.She\u2019d witnessed Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s death firsthand, and if she hadn\u2019t clamped her hands tightly around her mouth, she would have shrieked.Su Yi asked no further questions. He just crouched and started rifling through Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s possessions.A sheathed longsword, a yellow gourd, three thousand-tael silver notes, about twenty\u00a0taels\u00a0of scattered silver in his pockets, and a yellowed scroll so battered, only a few pages remained.There was nothing else worthy of attention.First, Su Yi put the notes and silver away. Then, he unfurled the scroll.Most of the scroll was ruined. The remaining pages described the wicked art of raising Ghoul Worms through human sacrifice; the content was utterly dark and heretical.After hurriedly skimming the text, Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed. Even if he compared it to other unorthodox or heretical techniques, this scroll\u2019s secret arts were pathetically crude; it was almost hilarious.But the single line of text at the very bottom of the final page drew his attention:\u201cFrom Weng Yunqi of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate, to his apprentice, Wu Ruoqiu.\u201dSu Yi instantly understood. The sect behind Wu Ruoqiu was this so-called \u201cDeathbringer\u2019s Gate\u201d, and his master was called Weng Yunqi.\u201cBefore he died, he said something about me ruining his sect\u2019s plans? It seems that Wu Ruoqiu was raising those Ghoul Worms on the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate\u2019s orders.\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up.He had a hunch that this wasn\u2019t the only place the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate was raising Ghoul Worms in.In other words, there were likely similar \u201cworm farms\u201d in other parts of Guangling City.Su Yi pondered a moment, then ripped the tattered scroll to shreds. If anyone else discovered a vile art like this, it could lead to disaster.Next, he picked up the sheathed sword.The sheath was made of iron, and when he drew the blade, the stench of blood and rotting flesh assailed his nostrils.Su Yi furrowed his brow in disgust.The sword was made of pine, but it was dyed a bloody red, while its edge was a sickly, lustrous green. It was vile beyond belief.\u201cHe actually used the menstrual blood of virgins to temper his sword? What kind of heretical cultivator was he? How worthless!\u201d Su Yi shook his head, feeling repulsed.Crunch!Su Yi exerted strength through his fingers, crushing the pine sword into shards. Then, he set it on fire until nothing but ash remained.When he picked up the last remaining object, something finally piqued his interest. \u201cOh? This gourd is actually rather interesting.\u201dSeth's Thoughts\u201cAt five steps away, even an emperor would be hard-pressed to defend himself. At close quarters, a single man was more threatening than a hostile nation!\u201dThe author seems to be referencing the historical novel \u201cEmperor Qianlong\u201d here. I could be wrong; I haven\u2019t read the book in question, and I had to do a little digging to translate this line. it looks like this is almost a quote but not quite; I would guess the author is misremembering it, or that he picked it up from some secondary source.The basic meaning is that an immediate threat is more terrifying than a powerful but distant foe, ie a single angry man can be more dangerous than an entire empire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Birds of a FeatherThe gourd was only about the size of a fist, and its surface was bright and lustrous. It had a wooden stopper, and it felt smooth to the touch.\u201cThe wooden stopper is a piece of Soul-Soothing Wood. It seems Wu Ruoqiu used the gourd to store and nourish souls.\u201d\u00a0When this thought occurred to him, Su Yi\u2019s expression went a little strange.He dug in his nails and pulled. The wooden stopper fell to the ground, and a blood-red, ghostly mist surged out.Whoosh~!The ghostly, sinister fog brimmed with malevolence and a sense of oppression.A toddler soon appeared within the mists. He looked only three or four years old. His skin was ghastly white, and his eyes were bright red. His face, which ought to have looked innocent and adorable, looked as if it had been smeared with red lipstick. The sight was terrifying!When the toddler appeared, a terrifyingly evil presence rippled around him, wilting the plants of the courtyard.The ghost in the red dress shrieked from the locust tree, \u201cA ghost baby! That\u2019s the ghost baby\u00a0Daoist\u00a0Wu has been raising for six years!\u201dAt almost the same time, the ghost baby let out a shrill wail. Shockingly, its mouth split apart, revealing two rows of long, knife-like fangs.It charged, and as it neared Su Yi, it tried to bite him!But before\u00a0it got\u00a0the chance, Su Yi stabbed with his sword.Splurt!The peach wood sword pierced right through the undead toddler\u2019s open mouth, running it through.Peach wood was a natural counter for ghosts.The section of peach wood Huang Qianjun had prepared for him was twenty years old and brimming with pure yang energy.Fwoosh! Fwoosh!Black smoke billowed from the ghost baby\u2019s body. Its face distorted, and it cried hideously, frenzied and struggling with all its might to charge and kill Su Yi.But it was all in vain.In the blink of an eye, its ethereal body burned and disappeared in a puff of smoke.The peach wood sword\u2019s luster had faded, and it was showing signs of corrosion; it was clearly no longer usable.Su Yi tossed it away, then examined the gourd once more. \u201cNot bad. This item was clearly grown in a spiritual ground; it has a hint of spirituality. In the world of the mundane, that\u2019s extremely rare.\u201dHe could already tell that the gourd had been Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s true secret weapon. Had he called upon it as soon as the battle started, he might have caused Su Yi a bit of trouble.\u201cCome on out.\u201d Su Yi sat back in his bamboo chair and casually reached for the lustrous, smooth yellow gourd.The red-clad lady ghost, Qing Wan, emerged from the locust tree. As she hovered before him, she lowered her head and trembled.\u201cMystic Master, I beg you, please don\u2019t kill me,\u201d she said, voice quivering. \u201cI\u2026. I can serve you!\u201d\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d asked Su Yi with great interest.Qing Wan thought for a moment, then said meekly, \u201cI can sing, dance, play the zither and the flute, play chess, paint\u2026. I know a little about all of them.\u201dSu Yi was stunned.\u00a0What the\u2014? A multi-talented lady ghost?Qing Wan\u2019s dress was red as blood, offsetting her snowy white complexion. She was petite, with a bit of baby fat left on her beautiful face. She was pretty and lovable.She looked about fifteen years old, right at the cusp of womanhood.Alas, she was only a yin soul, not a living person.When she saw Su Yi fall into a lengthy silence, Qing Wan grew increasingly unsettled. \u201cMystic Master, so long as you spare me, I\u2019ll do anything. I can help you scare people too!\u201dHer soft, sweet voice was racked with faint sobs; the sound was pitiful.Su Yi sighed. \u201cIf I had an Origin Dao cultivation, I could redeem your soul and release you from this world, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you now.\u201dQing Wan was briefly stunned. Then, she said delightedly, \u201cMystic Master, so you don\u2019t plan on killing me after all? That\u2019s wonderful!\u201dShe smiled so broadly, her eyes narrowed like crescent moons. In doing so, she inadvertently revealed her shocking charm. The combination of her pure, bright smile and timid nature was uniquely appealing.Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shifted up.\u00a0If she knew a cultivation technique suitable for ghosts, she\u2019d undoubtedly grow into a monstrous beauty, the bane of entire nations and all who live there\u2026.\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember anything about when you were alive?\u201d asked Su Yi.Qing Wan looked dazed. Her little face contorted in distress, and she sounded aggrieved. \u201cMystic Master, I won\u2019t lie to you; I still don\u2019t know why I wound up like this\u2026.\u201dSu Yi stared intently at her for quite some time. Finally, he said, \u201cRight now, there\u2019s one thing I know for sure: either you\u2019re lying, or there\u2019s a problem with your yin soul.\u201dQing Wan shook, then said hurriedly, \u201cMystic Master, I wouldn\u2019t dare deceive you in the slightest! I swear by the heavens themselves.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which possibility is correct,\u201d said Su Yi flatly. \u201cIt has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m not going to kill you, but I won\u2019t just let you go, either.\u201dQing Wan sighed in relief. \u201cI\u2019ll be grateful so long as you spare me.\u201dSu Yi raised the yellow gourd and said, \u201cThis is a Soul-Nurturing Gourd. If you hide inside, you\u2019ll have no need to fear the light of day. Go on in.\u201dQing Wan hesitated. \u201cMystic Master, you\u2026 You will let me out, won\u2019t you?\u201dSu Yi laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t think so little of me! I won\u2019t seal it, and later, when the time is right, I might even teach you a ghost cultivation technique.\u201dQing Wan nodded delightedly. \u201cI\u2019m willing!\u201dWith that, she blurred into a streak of red light and shot into the gourd.For a mere yin soul to possess such a pure spiritual body is rare indeed, yet she has no memories of before she died. That\u2019s a problem in its own right\u2026But with the methods at my disposal, I\u2019ll naturally have the chance to find an answer sooner or later.As Su Yi pondered, he rose and got to work. Before long, he\u2019d cleaned up. No corpses or blood remained in the courtyard.Afterward, he returned to his room, hung the gourd by his desk, and lay down. Before long, he was fast asleep.The next morning, Su Yi rose before the sun, glanced at the hanging yellow gourd, then ignored it and left the room.The Soul-Nurturing Gourd wasn\u2019t sealed. Qing Wan could leave whenever she wished.However, the meek, beautiful ghost had been quiet throughout the night, not making the slightest peep.After washing up, Su Yi gnawed on a piece of raw Nine-Leafed King Ginseng, then practiced the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique beside the locust tree.After three rounds of practice, he sensed that his sinews were comfortably loose, and his whole body felt lighter, almost as if he were floating.This was a sign that he\u2019d entered the early \u201cRefining Sinew\u201d stage!Upon cultivating to this stage, one\u2019s blood and qi were concentrated, their breathing controlled and regular. When they attacked, they were as mighty as a tiger or leopard, as flexible and nimble as a civet.Shortly after, Hu Quan, the steward, emerged from the clinic carrying a plate of food. He served it with a smile. \u201cSir, Elder Wu prepared this himself. It\u2019s a medicinal meal, just for you.\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cPlease thank Elder Wu on my behalf.\u201dHe glanced at the medicinal cuisine. It included quite a few precious medicinal herbs. The combination of medicinal ingredients and the generous portions made it highly suitable for martial artists who needed to replenish their bodies.\u201cAlright, sir. Enjoy your meal. I\u2019ll head back to the clinic.\u201d Hu Quan smiled and left.Living here really is far preferable to living with the Wen Family,\u00a0thought Su Yi.Just as he finished eating breakfast, he heard a familiar voice from beyond the courtyard.\u00a0Huang Qianjun charged inside, his eyes full of enthusiasm. \u201cBrother Su, I already sent someone to notify Old Man Wang Tianyang. We can head over now.\u201dSuddenly, he flared his nostrils. \u201cHuh? Why does the courtyard smell faintly of blood?\u201dThe kid\u2019s got a surprisingly keen nose.\u00a0Su Yi glanced at the young silkpants, then said casually, \u201cA ghost showed up last night.\u201d\u201cA ghost?\u201d Huang Qianjun jumped. He recalled the rooster blood, willow, and peach wood he\u2019d assembled, and terrifying mental images flooded his consciousness. He trembled from head to toe.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry,\u201d said Su Yi. He was already headed out of the courtyard. Huang Qianjun had no time for blind terror; he cast those thoughts aside and chased after him.\u2026..A swordsmith\u2019s workshop owned by Huang Family stood facing the street in the east of Guangling City.When Su Yi and Huang Qianjun arrived, there was already a long line of people waiting outside, almost all of them young men and women.\u201cIs business that good?\u201d asked Su Yi in surprise.\u201cOur business has always been decent,\u201d Huang Qianjun hurriedly explained, \u201cBut it\u2019s not usually this packed. It\u2019s like this today because we\u2019ll be holding the next \u2018Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet\u2019 on the Great Azure in just half a month.\u201cYoung elites from Guangling City and our neighbors from across the river, Cloudfall City, will cross blades and compare martial arts to see who\u2019s stronger.\u201cIf a martial artist of Guangling City takes home first place, the Cloudfall City Lord will give them a thousand taels of gold, three stalks of spiritual medicine, ten clusters of pearls, as well as a peak yellow-grade secret technique!\u201cConversely, if a martial artist of Cloudfall City takes first place, the Guangling City Lord must offer the same reward!\u201dWhen Huang Qianjun finished his explanation, Su Yi said, \u201cThe prize is awfully generous.\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s gaze filled with longing. \u201cMore than the prizes, it\u2019s about prestige! The winner of each year\u2019s Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet\u2019s name will spread throughout both cities, and they\u2019ll even gain easy admission to continue their cultivation in Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s inner sect!\u201dSu Yi nodded.He\u2019d cultivated in Blueriver Sword Manor for three years. He was naturally well aware that to the youths of Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s nineteen provinces, just entering Blueriver Sword Manor was already incomparably difficult.Those who became inner sect disciples were like carp jumping over the dragon\u2019s gate.Back then, it took Su Yi three years of bitter cultivation to become the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect. He was qualified to enter the inner sect, but due to an unexpected incident, the Blueriver Sword Manor cast him out instead\u2026.But then, fortune and disaster went hand in hand. It was because of this that he reawakened his memories of his past life.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that the people in line plan to use their newly-purchased weapons to participate in the banquet?\u201d asked Su Yi.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Something suddenly occurred to Huang Qianjun, who whispered, \u201cBrother Su, Elder Wang Tianyang has a fiery temper, and he\u2019s a bit surly. Even my father has to treat him with respect. When we meet him, please don\u2019t take offense if he says something unpleasant.\u201d\u201cLead the way,\u201d said Su Yi.Huang Qianjun rushed ahead. As Huang Yunchong\u2019s son, there was naturally no need for him to wait in line.But just as he was about to enter the swordsmith\u2019s workshop, a group of youths walked out.Their leader was none other than Wen Jueyuan, the leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation. The group tailing after him were all Wen Family youths.Wen Shaobei was among them too.When he saw Su Yi and Huang Qianjun, Wen Jueyuan was stunned despite himself. A moment later, he shook his head hatefully. \u201cA live-in son-in-law and a silkpants? Birds of a feather sure do flock together!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Ol\u2019 Wang Blows His TopSetting aside his status as Wen Changjing\u2019s son, as the leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation, Wen Jueyuan\u2019s pride wasn\u2019t unfounded.At nine, he entered Pinecloud Sword Manor to begin his cultivation, becoming the man of the hour, a child prodigy.\u00a0At thirteen, he\u2019d smoothly joined Blueriver Sword Manor as an outer sect disciple.\u00a0After just four years, he\u2019d been chosen to enter the inner sect, and he was ranked near the top.Today, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm, the Refining Bone stage.\u00a0This level of accomplishment in the Martial Dao was enough to make even some of Guangling City\u2019s major powers sigh over their own inferiority!How could someone like him possibly take a live-in son-in-law like Su Yi seriously?He disdained to pay a spoiled hoodlum like Huang Qianjun any heed, much less Su Yi.\u201cBirds of a feather? What an apt description!\u201d Wen Shaobei and the other Wen Family youths burst into laughter.\u00a0With Wen Jueyuan to back them up, they weren\u2019t the least bit afraid of Huang Qianjun despite this being the Huang Family\u2019s smithy.\u201cWen Jueyuan, who do you think you\u2019re insulting?\u201d Huang Qianjun glared viciously.\u201cWhat, did I say something wrong?\u201d Wen Jueyuan looked at him coldly. \u201cWho in Guangling City doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re nothing but a delinquent silkpants? Who doesn\u2019t know that Su Yi is nothing but the live-in son-in-law everyone makes fun of?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Huang Qianjun\u2019s eyes went bloodshot.But Wen Jueyuan merely laughed. \u201cThe curtain opens on the next \u2018Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet\u201d in just two weeks. I plan to participate. Young Master Huang, if you\u2019re really so capable, why not join in the fun and show me what you\u2019ve got?\u201dAs soon as he said this, the surrounding area burst into uproar.\u201cWe\u2019re finished! With someone like Wen Jueyuan participating, there\u2019s no way the likes of us can stand out!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t despair. We just have to put on a good showing. As for first place\u2026. Only people like Wen Jueyuan are qualified to vie for it anyway.\u201dThe youths in line to buy weapons were all chatting amongst themselves, Wen Jueyuan the focus of their conversations.They all got the sense that this year, the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet\u2019s championship might very well fall to him!From this, it was clear just how lofty Wen Jueyuan\u2019s status amongst Guangling City\u2019s younger generation was.Listening to the crowd\u2019s chatter filled the Wen Family youths with pride. They puffed up on their chests and held their heads up high.Huang Qianjun\u2019s face was ashen, and his expression shifted back and forth. However, before he could say anything, Wen Jueyuan beat him to the punch. \u201cDon\u2019t waste words. If you\u2019ve got guts, let\u2019s meet at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet!\u201dWith that, he turned and led the Wen Family youths away, ignoring Su Yi completely; he disdained competing with a mere cripple like him.\u00a0The moment he did, others would mock him for bullying the weak.Besides, how could bullying a live-in son-in-law give him any sense of accomplishment?Huang Qianjun watched Wen Jueyuan and his posse leave. He clenched his fist and pursed his lips, his face ashen and expression unsightly.\u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Su Yi glanced at the young silkpants.Huang Qianjun took a deep breath and nodded. Suddenly, as if he\u2019d only just realized something, he said dazedly, \u201cBrother Su, you\u2026 What about you? You aren\u2019t angry at all?\u201dHe was confused. During their first encounter at the Immortal Gathering House, Su Yi had easily defeated all of his subordinates.That level of power was in no way ordinary!Furthermore, with Su Yi\u2019s network, he could make even Huang Yunchong lower his head in submission.So how could Su Yi just let this go?\u201cHe\u2019s nothing but an ant clamoring for attention,\u201d said Su Yi lightly. \u201cIf he managed to make me angry, I\u2019d actually think better of him. Unfortunately, he\u2019s not worthy.\u201dHuang Qianjun was stunned; he obviously couldn\u2019t understand.Su Yi couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain any further, either.But there was one thing he left unsaid; when someone stood against him, no matter who they were, things wouldn\u2019t end well for them.This minor interlude passed quickly.Within the swordsmith\u2019s forge, before a blazing furnace.Huang Qianjun had led Su Yi straight to the famed master swordsmith Wang Tianyang.Wang Tianyang\u2019s hair was so sparse, he was practically bald, and he was gaunt with copper-colored skin. He gripped a hammer in one hand, and was currently forging a red-hot, unfinished sword.Sparks scattered in all directions, lighting up the room.\u201cSir, my friend is here. Is there any chance you might do me a favor and forge him a sword?\u201d Huang Qianjun stood off to the side, smiling and humbly clasping his fist.However, Wang Tianyang ignored him completely. He simply continued hammering away at the sword he was working on. The sound of clanging metal filled the air, and some of the sparks almost landed on Huang Qianjun.Realizing that he\u2019d been ignored, Huang Qianjun laughed awkwardly, then turned to Su Yi and whispered, \u201cBrother Su, Elder Wang has always been like this. Please, don\u2019t take offense.\u201d\u201cLet him finish what he\u2019s doing first,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cFor now, lead me to look at the materials. I need to decide what\u2019s going into my sword.\u201dHuang Qianjun hurriedly nodded.The swordsmith\u2019s forge naturally had no shortage of materials for crafting weapons, including a few rare and precious metals.After seeing everything they had available, Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but sink into silence.\u00a0Even the best-regarded, expensive materials were still just ordinary materials.\u201cYou\u2019re not satisfied, Brother Su? This is the best smithy in Guangling City. If you can\u2019t find anything you like, you\u2019ll probably have to go to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital to find something better,\u201d explained Huang Qianjun.Su Yi neither confirmed nor denied it. \u201cGo get my materials ready. I need thirty catties of Bluelight Cold Iron, a catty of Blazing Red Copper Powder, five catties of Purified Profound Ice Water\u2026..\u201dHe requested more than ten ingredients in total. Some were valuable, while others were ordinary.Huang Qianjun wrote them down, then ordered some of the smithy\u2019s servants to prepare them. Meanwhile, he led Su Yi back to Wang Tianyang\u2019s forge.Wang Tianyang had finished the sword he was working on, and he was currently reclining in a wicker chair. A servant stood beside him, pouring him water and tea.\u201cSir\u2026.\u201dBut just as Huang Qianjun started to speak, Wang Tianyang cut him off. \u201cI already forged a sword today, and I\u2019ve exhausted most of my energy. Come back in three days.\u201dAs he spoke, he raised his teacup to his lips and sipped leisurely.Huang Qianjun\u2019s expression flickered back and forth. He\u2019d invited Su Yi here personally, only to get refused, and in his own family\u2019s territory! How was he supposed to face Su Yi now?He took a deep breath, then said, \u201cSir, my father said that anything Brother Su needs is to be completed posthaste. You\u2014\u201dHe tried to argue, only for Wang Tianyang to interrupt him once more. \u201cThen have your father forge him a sword,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cI certainly have no time to spare serving your \u2018Brother Su\u2019.\u201dSu Yi was standing right there in plain sight, but Wang Tianyang wasn\u2019t the least bit polite, nor was he the least bit concerned when Huang Qianjun brought up Huang Yunchong. This level of arrogance was extraordinary.It was then that a group of servants arrived, lugging a gigantic box. \u201cYoung Master, we\u2019ve finished preparing the materials you requested.\u201dWhen he saw this, Wang Tianyang immediately lost his temper. He roared, \u201cWho told you to bring those in here? I\u2019ve spent the past two weeks doing nothing but forging swords. I planned to have myself a nice rest, then find a brothel and burn off steam, only for you dim-wits to show up and cause trouble. You put that stuff right back where it came from!\u201dHe was so mad, he rose from his wicker chair and flung his teacup to the ground.Ah, so he\u2019s in a rush to find a brothel\u2026.\u00a0Huang Qianjun instantly understood. For someone as hearty and vigorous as Wang Tianyang, being pent up for two weeks was indeed hard to bear.Suddenly, a bold idea occurred to him.\u00a0Why not introduce Elder Wang to that \u2018Nong\u2019 character Brother Su taught me? It might help take the edge off his immediate need?\u201cWait.\u201d When he saw the servants prepare to return the materials, Su Yi spoke up. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to have someone else forge my sword anyway.\u201dWhen they heard this, both Huang Qianjun and Wang Tianyang were stunned.\u201cMight you lend me your forge?\u201d Su Yi glanced at the nearby furnace.\u201cOf course he can,\u201d said Huang Qianjun immediately. \u201cBut\u2026. Brother Su, are you planning to forge your sword yourself?\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAs a sword cultivator, the swords that suited him best were those he made himself. Only then could he fully realize his Sword Dao.\u201cOh? Kid, are you just here to cause trouble?\u201d Wang Tianyang laughed coldly, his gaze disdainful.A boy whose breath still reeked of his mothers milk planned to forge a sword right in front of him? This provocation was far too much!\u201cSir, please don\u2019t misunderstand! How could my Brother Su want to do something like that? He\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d Huang Qianjun trailed off, uncertain of how to explain.He really hadn\u2019t known that Su Yi planned to forge his own weapon.Wang Tianyang was like a riled-up rooster; Su Yi\u2019s declaration had triggered his competitive spirit.\u201cNo need to explain,\u201d he shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s already at my doorstep. How could I possibly ignore such provocation? If I let this go and word got out, won\u2019t the martial artists of Guangling City think I'm afraid of\u00a0him?\u201dAs he spoke, he pointed to the furnace and fixed his gaze on Su Yi. \u201cUse the furnace as you please,\u201d he said haughtily. \u201cIs there anything else you need? I\u2019ll satisfy your every request, so if you\u2019ve got skill, make sure you show me everything you\u2019ve got!\u201dSu Yi pondered for a moment, then said, \u201cThe fire isn\u2019t vigorous enough. How about you man the bellows?\u201dThis request caught Wang Tianyang completely off guard. Despite himself, he was dazed. When he came back to his senses, he pointed at himself in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2026 You want to make me\u2026.. Man the bellows for you?\u201dThe atmosphere instantly grew tense. The nearby servants gasped; it was clear that Old Man Wang Tianyang was angry.Huang Qianjun was frantic, but just as he was about to try and smooth things over, he saw Su Yi nod, as if his request were perfectly natural. \u201cYou\u2019re the best swordsmith in Guangling City, so naturally, you have the best control over the furnace's temperatures. If you man the bellows, it\u2019s unlikely anything will go wrong while I forge my sword.\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s mind went blank.\u00a0A grandmaster swordsmith! Yet Brother Su wants him to\u2026 man the bellows? \u2026.the hell?When he looked at Wang Tianyang, he saw the smith\u2019s chest heaving violently, his coppery skin flushed red. It was clear that he\u2019d blown his top.\u201cSir, please don\u2019t be angry!\u201d Huang Qianjun hurriedly tried to soothe him.Wang Tianyang gnashed his teeth and swept his arm. \u201cOut of the way! This old man\u2019s been forging swords for forty years. What winds and rain haven\u2019t I seen before? A little provocation is not enough to stop me!\u201dIt\u2019s just manning the bellows, right? Fine, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d His gaze then landed on the servants.\u201cGo on,\u201d he ordered. \u201cHave the other swordsmiths set aside their work and come on over. Let\u2019s see what this troublemaker can do!\u201dThis is bad!\u00a0Huang Qianjun cried out inwardly.\u00a0He plans to make this blow up!But when he looked at Su Yi, he saw that his expression was as calm as ever. He couldn\u2019t help but recall what happened yesterday at the Apricot Clinic. Scenes of Su Yi displaying his attainments in medicine replayed through his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Want to Learn? I\u2019ll Teach YouBefore long, servants alerted all the weaponsmiths, who rushed over.When they learned what happened, they couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads and laugh. They saw this whole incident as a mere farce.\u00a0No one took it seriously.Even if a youth understood a bit of swordsmithing, could he really outdo their top smith and shatter their workshop\u2019s reputation?Some of them even tried to persuade Wang Tianyang to let this go. \u201cElder Wang, calm down. He\u2019s young and senseless. Why take this so seriously? With your status, pursuing this is beneath you.\u201d\u201cBeneath me?\u201d Wang Tianyang snapped, \u201cNonsense! I\u2019ve spent my whole life eating, drinking, carousing, and gambling as I please. When have I ever cared about poise or elegance? Just stand there and watch!\u201dHe approached the furnace, picked up the tongs, and began adding fuel to the flames, shouting, \u201cHey, Su whatever-your-name-is, weren\u2019t you going to show us a thing or two? Hurry up and expand our horizons!\u201dThe weaponsmiths laughed bitterly. All of them understood Wang Tianyang\u2019s pig-headed temper.\u201cYoung man, since you\u2019re Young Master\u2019s Huang\u2019s friend, we\u2019ll be happy to help you forge a sword. Is there any need to compete with Elder Wang?\u201d One of the smiths offered Su Yi a well-intentioned warning. \u201cHurry and apologize. Then, this will all end here.\u201d\u201cI came here intending to forge myself a sword,\u201d said Su Yi lightly. \u201cI have no time to waste competing with someone who doesn\u2019t want to work.\u201dAs he spoke, he approached the furnace.There was a huge copper table beside it, a dazzling array of tools spread across its surface.Su Yi glanced at the servants and ordered, \u201cPut the materials over here.\u201dWhen they saw this, the weaponsmiths furrowed their brows in deep displeasure.\u00a0How can this boy be so senseless?But out of respect for Huang Qianjun\u2019s position, they didn\u2019t voice their criticisms. Otherwise, they\u2019d have kicked Su Yi out the door already.One of the smiths turned toward Huang Qianjun and complained, \u201cYoung Master Huang, who is this friend of yours? He\u2019s so young, but he\u2019s got quite the temper!\u2019Huang Qianjun was already distressed, and he said irritably, \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pointless questions? You\u2019ll find out if he\u2019s up to the task or not if you just watch!\u201dThe weaponsmith he\u2019d just chastised no longer dared argue, but when he looked at Su Yi, it was with even greater displeasure.\u201cYoung Master Huang has spoken, so let\u2019s see what this young friend of his is capable of!\u201d someone snorted coldly.The others seemed eager to watch the show and see Su Yi make a fool of himself.Once the servants got the necessary materials in position, Su Yi got to work.He was just forging a single mundane weapon. This would be no challenge at all.First, he tossed six or seven materials into the furnace. Then, he ordered Wang Tianyang, \u201cMore heat. Keep going until I tell you otherwise.\u201dThe crowd was stunned.\u00a0That pipsqueak sure is rude! Look at how he\u2019s talking to Elder Wang!Wang Tianyan\u2019s cheeks twitched, and he forced his temper back down. He continuously added charcoal and other materials to increase the temperature.A full fifteen minutes passed before Su Yi casually tossed the Blazing Yang Copper Powder into the furnace, then ordered, \u201cKeep increasing the heat.\u201dWang Tianyang felt stifled, but he said nothing. He just did as he was told.He was holding back his rage, eager to see Su Yi mess up during the forging process. Then, he\u2019d vent all his pent-up fury at once.Throughout the forging process, Su Yi intermittently tossed in new materials and ordered Wang Tianyang to adjust the heat. It seemed he really did see this master swordsmith as a mere assistant.Watching this play out, the other weaponsmiths felt deep displeasure. They thought Su Yi wantonly arrogant, with no respect for his elders.Huang Qianjun, however, was eagerly anticipating the results.He could see that Su Yi looked comfortable and at ease while working the forge, and that he had no shortage of confidence.Worst case scenario, Brother Su\u2019s sword is inferior to Elder Wang\u2019s work. So long as he successfully forges a sword, he won\u2019t embarrass himself. That\u2019ll be enough.When he realized this, Huang Qianjun relaxed.\u201cA little more heat.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. Keep going.\u201d\u201cMore.\u201d\u2026..For a while, all they heard was Su Yi repeatedly urging Wang Tianyang to increase the heat.Wang Tianyang\u2019s expression was increasingly unsightly. Steam blew from his nostrils, and his nearly-bald head was practingly smoking with fury. He was starting to look uncomfortable, too.Huang Qianjun and the swordsmiths all wore different expressions on their faces.\u2026.An hour later, the waves of heat emanating from the forge were so intense, the entire room felt as if it were boiling.The onlookers were covered in sweat, and their clothes were drenched. They felt as if they were standing beside an active volcano.Wang Tianyang was closest to the forge, so rivers of sweat poured down his balding head. His dark skin had turned bright red.He was a grandmaster swordsmith, but he was nearing his limit.It was then that Su Yi took out his Purple-streaked Gold ring and tossed it into the forge.Boom!Tongues of flame swept across the room, bursting with dazzling light.The ring melted at speeds visible to the naked eye, becoming strands of lustrous faint purple liquid.Su Yi didn\u2019t hesitate. He immediately poured the five catties of Purified Profound Ice Water straight into the furnace.When the icy-cold water and blazing heat collided, the result was a burst of steam. Soon, mist had permeated the entire room, obscuring the onlookers\u2019 vision. They instinctively drew back for fear that the scalding steam would burn them.Wang Tianyang\u2019s angry voice resounded, echoing through the steam-filled workshop. \u201cWhen quenching a sword, who just pours Purified Profound Ice Water straight into the furnace? I\u2019ve never seen such a ludicrous technique before!\u201dDisdain, indignation, pointed questions.The other weaponsmiths didn\u2019t even know what to say.They forged swords year round, but they\u2019d never seen anyone do what Su Yi had just done. He was obviously fumbling blindly in the dark!Before long, the waves of heat and scalding steam receded, and the onlookers\u2019 field of view cleared up.When Wang Tianyang came back into view, it seemed as if his eyebrows had been burnt clean off. What little sparse hair he\u2019d once had was gone; he was now fully bald and red as a soy-marinated egg.He gnashed his teeth, clearly beside himself with rage.Su Yi, meanwhile, looked calm and focused. He held pliers in his hand, with which he held the crude outline of his sword. He held it in front of him and examined it. The unfinished blade was dark throughout, with a faint purple luster. That aside, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything special about it.\u201cThe shape of the sword actually looks pretty good\u2026.\u201d said one of the weaponsmiths in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s still just an outline,\u201d said another. \u201cWe still have to see whether or not it can withstand tempering. I certainly don\u2019t think it can. Even if it does, how good can a weapon made from such a crude hunk of metal possibly be?\u201d\u201cA good weapon needs both quality materials and a good edge. This kid came here to cause trouble, so he ought to be able to make a good sword!\u201d laughed one of the smiths in a blatant attempt to fan the flames and stir up trouble.They\u2019re clearly just here to watch him make a fool of himself!\u00a0Huang Qianjun laughed coldly to himself, but he said nothing.\u00a0We\u2019ll see who\u2019s laughing in the end.Then, they watched as Su Yi put the crude metal bar onto the anvil, raised a massive hammer with his right hand, and swung it.Clang!Sparks scattered in all directions, and deafening booms rang out.The audience\u2019s eardrums buzzed, and despite themselves, they looked stunned.\u00a0That kid\u2019s raw power sure is something! That hammer\u2019s massive, but in his hands, it looks as light as a feather. He\u2019s controlling it as easily as if it were a part of his body.Wang Tianyang watched Su Yi\u2019s movements with rapt attention, eagerly waiting for him to make a fool of himself\u2026.Clang! Clang! Clang!The sound of metal against metal echoed throughout the workshop. Every time the massive hammer landed, sparks flew like fireworks, the sight dazzlingly beautiful.Everyone gradually realized that something wasn\u2019t quite right.Before long, one of the weaponsmiths couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cWhat technique is this? Listen to that! It\u2019s got a distinct cadence, almost like breathing. Now look at the sword! It\u2019s like it\u2019s responding to the hammer, resonating with every impact. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re connected even from a distance!\u201dThe others looked bewildered; they could sense what was happening too.Amidst the scattering sparks, every blow of the hammer had an indescribable rhythm. Beneath the relentless onslaught of blows, the crude,\u00a0coarse\u00a0outline of the sword shrank, becoming denser and more compact, taking shape\u2026..\u201cHas that kid really mastered some unique method of forging swords?\u201dAll of the swordsmiths were wondering the same thing, and their expressions became far graver and more serious.At first, Su Yi\u2019s arrogance had infuriated them, and they\u2019d already prepared what they were going to say after his attempt to forge a sword inevitably failed. They\u2019d teach him that every industry had its own complexities, the importance of respecting experts, as well as the price one paid for overestimating their own abilities.But now\u2026.No one would dare entertain such thoughts.These were experienced smiths who worked the forge year-round. There was no way\u2019d miss how extraordinary Su Yi\u2019s technique was!See? Look at that!\u00a0Huang Qianjun shouted to himself.\u00a0I just knew that once Brother Su took action, he could convince those arrogant old farts!It\u2019ll be just like what happened back at the Apricot Clinic!Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but glance at Wang Tianyang.The balding grandmaster swordsmith stood there like a statue, completely dazed as he watched Su Yi\u2019s movements. His expression shifted, and his chest heaved.He was clearly agitated!Haha, hahaha! So even Elder Wang, the fiery-tempered brothel frequenter, is stunned?\u00a0Huang Qianjun was so delighted he almost burst into laughter.He\u2019d never seen Wang Tianyang lose control like this!The old man was so proud, he disregarded even Huang Yunchong. Yet now, he might very well lower his head before Su Yi!Some time later\u2014Clang!The clear hum of a sword reverberated throughout the room. To the audience, it was like the voice of divinity, stunning them to their senses and shaking them out of their scattered thoughts.It drew even Huang Qianjun\u2019s gaze and attention.What he saw was\u2014A two foot, seven inch sword, three fingers wide, the blade a clear, bright black. Su Yi clutched it by the hilt.Although it was black, it had an ethereal quality to it, like the night sky. It was double-edged, and it glinted with subtle flashes of light.Su Yi shifted his wrists, and the inky darkness of the sword flashed with a faint, gleaming purple luster, giving it an additional, illusory air.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d All of the weaponsmiths were moved. Their gazes heated up, and they looked entranced. This was a sword with spirituality!Facing it, their proud hearts silently gave it. They were convinced.That sword is in no way comparable to ordinary weapons!\u00a0Huang Qianjun\u2019s heart thudded in his chest. Just looking at the sword, he felt a sharp, pricking sensation. There was no way he\u2019d miss how extraordinary it was!Bzzz!Su Yi tapped his index finger lightly against the blade, and the sword flashed with purple light and rumbled like thunder, the sound filling the room.When he saw this, Su Yi nodded with a hint of satisfaction.Although this wasn\u2019t really a spiritual weapon, after adding the Purple-Streaked Gold, it had a trace of spirituality to it. This elevated it far beyond ordinary swords, putting it right at the border between mortal and spiritual weapons!\u201cYou\u2026. What kind of sword forging technique was that?\u201d Wang Tianyang had been silent all this time, but he finally spoke up. His gaze was bewildered, as if he\u2019d lost his soul, or as if he were too stunned to think straight.Su Yi glanced at the swordsmith. \u201cWant to learn? I can teach you.\u201dWang Tianyang shook from head to toe, and his eyes widened, as if he dared not believe his ears.His expression changed dramatically, flitting back and forth.Finally, beneath the crowd\u2019s watchful eyes, the famed grandmaster swordsmith of Guangling City lowered his head in shame and bowed low at the waist.\u201cYoung Lord, your methods are ingenious. I can only look up to you!\u201d\u201cYoung Lord, you\u2019re a visionary. I can only look up to you!\u201dHis voice was solemn, and the rest of the room fell silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Unwelcome VisitorsWhen he left the workshop, Su Yi had a new sheathed longsword.Wang Tianyang had made the sheath himself. It was crafted of tanned blue shark skin, with cast metal clouds and ringlets. It had a timeless, simple elegance.It\u2019s worth noting that he didn\u2019t accept so much as a single piece of silver to cover the cost of materials.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that Su Yi didn\u2019t want to pay him, but that Wang Tianyang would rather die than accept payment\u2026.\u201cTch, you\u2019ve really broadened my horizons. Who would have thought that a proud ol\u2019 brothel frequenter like Elder Wang would one day lower his head?\u201d\u00a0Even though they\u2019d already left the smithy, Huang Qianjun was overcome with excitement.Just now, the smiths had been like a group of schoolboys, listening attentively as Su Yi taught them his forging technique. Wang Tianyang was no exception.To Su Yi, this was just a method of crafting ordinary mortal weapons. It wasn\u2019t much at all.But to Wang Tianyang and the other smiths, it was an enormous stroke of fortune. All of them were so excited, they didn\u2019t know what to do with themselves. They felt awe, reverence, and terror, and they even changed how they addressed Su Yi. He was now \u201cGrandmaster Su.\u201dAs a result, when Su Yi attempted to pay the bill, Wang Tianyang and the other weaponsmiths were frantic. No matter what he said, they refused to accept their \u201cGrandmaster Su\u2019s\u201d money.Huang Qianjun had watched the entire incident play out. Of course he was moved!Suddenly, Su Yi asked, \u201cAre you planning to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet?\u201dJust once sentence, and Huang Qianjun\u2019s delight soured as he recalled their encounter with Wen Jueyuan.After a moment\u2019s silence, he said bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m only in the Refining Muscle stage of the Blood Circulation Realm, while Wen Jueyuan is already in the Refining Bone stage. The gap between us is huge, and the banquet is only a month away; even if I work hard, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no way to catch up to him in time.\u201dThen, his eyes flashed with vicious light, and his voice filled with staunch determination. \u201cBut I\u2019ll participate even if I can\u2019t win. Defeat isn\u2019t scary, but being too scared to even face him? That\u2019s real cowardice. If I just give up, I\u2019ll never be able to raise my head again!\u201dSu Yi nodded, and, in a rare display of chattiness, said, \u201cMen ought to be ambitious and youths ought to be hot-blooded. You ought to forge ahead bravely, without fear of defeat.\u201cSometimes, it seems like you\u2019ve only taken a single step back, but in truth, you\u2019ve lost far more than you realize. This isn\u2019t about the heights of your cultivation; it\u2019s about your mental state. By giving up, you\u2019ve already planted the seeds of cowardice in your heart.\u201dAs he said this, even Su Yi felt emotional.When cultivating, every step was difficult, but only by enduring and bravely forging ahead could one clear the way ahead and realize a transcendent Great Dao!Cowards could never reach the peak, not even if they worked their entire lives.Huang Qianjun was stunned. He suddenly recalled his father\u2019s frequent lectures.\u201cMy boy, others might laugh at your domineering arrogance, but as your father, I think it\u2019s for the best. When cultivating the Martial Dao, you ought to run amok without reservation, with no fear of heaven, earth, gods, or ghosts!\u201dHearing Su Yi\u2019s words, Huang Qianjun felt an inexplicable surge of complex emotions.A long time passed, and his gaze gradually filled with determination. \u201cBrother Su, I\u2019ll remember what you just taught me. From now on, I won\u2019t back down in the face of trouble!\u201dSu Yi reminded him, \u201cI said you shouldn\u2019t shrink back, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be reckless. Figure out the right balance for yourself.\u201dWith that, he said no more. He\u2019d never really liked lecturing others.Some things were easier said than done. Some concepts required firsthand experience, training, and overcoming countless obstacles to truly comprehend.\u201cBrother Su, are you going to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet?\u201d asked Huang Qianjun.Su Yi shook his head. \u201cThe rewards are ample, but it sounds far too dull.\u201dDull?The banquet is a stand-off between the youths of Guangling and Cloudfall Cities. This grand spectacle isn\u2019t enough to arouse Brother Su\u2019s interest?Huang Qianjun fell silent, unsure of how to respond.Before long, they passed an alleyway and heard a child shriek. \u201cSu Yi! Hurry up and save me! Hurry!\u201dHuang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but look, only to see a group of kids clustered in the alleyway, beating up another little boy.It was their victim who\u2019d just cried out for help. The others had him pressed to the ground, and his face was covered in dirt as he wailed.Wen Mingrong.At the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet, he was the one who announced \u201cI, Wen Mingrong, might be young, but even I disdain to consort with a live-in son-in-law like Su Yi!\u201d This declaration made the entire venue burst with laughter.Some of the elders even praised the boy\u2019s spirit and said his future prospects were immeasurable.\u00a0Yet now, Wen Mingrong was being bullied, and he\u2019d even begged the very Su Yi he \u201cdisdained to consort with \u201c for aid.Su Yi merely glanced at him, then continued strolling leisurely ahead without so much as stopping, as if he\u2019d seen nothing at all.This cruel indifference left Wen Mingrong frantic. He shrieked, \u201cFine! Su Yi, just you wait! When I get home, I\u2019ll\u00a0tell on you!\u201dIt was then that Huang Qianjun walked over. The bullies whaling on Wen Mingrong froze, instantly on guard.\u201cAre you here to save me? Great! When I get back, I\u2019ll have my father reward you!\u201d Wen Mingrong was wild with joy.But against all expectations, Huang Qianjun merely squatted and pinched his dirt-smeared cheek, hard. It hurt so much that\u00a0Wen\u00a0Mingrong grimaced and burst into tears.\u201cLittle boy, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re a bit confused?\u201d Huang Qianjun laughed gleefully. \u201cIf my station\u00a0allowed\u00a0it, I\u2019ll slap you around myself. You\u2019ve got no manners at all.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Wen Mingrong\u2019s mind went blank.\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Keep going.\u201d Huang Qianjun rose, issued the bullies a few orders, then left, laughing as he went.Before long, Wen Mingrong\u2019s shrieks and pleas filled the alleyway once more\u2026.But none of this had anything to do with Su Yi\u2026.\u2026\u2026The Apricot Clinic.When Su Yi returned, he saw a group of guards standing by the gates. They looked vigorous and well-trained, and they weren\u2019t letting anyone enter.The space around the clinic was empty; all of the patients had long since left.\u201cIs this some sort of challenge?\u201d Huang Qianyun\u2019s eyes flashed, threatening violence, and he strode forward. \u201cHey scumbags! Who told you you could act wildly here?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Huang?\u201d When they saw Huang Qianjun, there was a clear uproar amongst the guards. However, none of them backed down; they clearly had confidence in their backing.Their leader, a man in black, said gravely, \u201cYoung Master Huang, the Apricot Clinic is the Wen Family\u2019s territory here. How can you call protecting it \u2018acting wildly\u2019?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re from the Wen Family?\u201d Huang Qianjun was stunned.The man in black nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re subordinates of the Wen Family\u2019s second\u00a0elder. We\u2019ve come here on business with our family\u2019s young master. Young Master Huang, this has nothing to do with you, so you\u2019d best not get involved.\u201dHuang Qianjun furrowed his brow. \u201cYour family\u2019s young master? You mean that Wen Jieyuan guy?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d The man in black nodded.Huang Qianjun instantly understood. The Apricot Clinic had been under Wen Changqing\u2019s control to begin with, yet yesterday, Su Yi had taken over its leadership.Furthermore, he\u2019d cleansed the place of everyone indentured to Wen Changqing in one fell swoop.There was no doubt about it. Wen Changqing\u2019s son, Wen Jieyuan, was here for revenge!The man in black had already noticed the nearby Su Yi, and his gaze instantly turned vicious.He raised his hand, pointed, and shouted, \u201cWen Family Son-in-Law, you\u2019re finally back. Do you have any idea how long our young master has been waiting for you?\u201dThe other guards looked distinctly unfriendly too. After all, they\u2019d come here to help Wen Jieyuan make trouble; how could they possibly treat Su Yi respectfully?\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d Huang Qianjun was just about to shout when Su Yi put his hand on his shoulder.\u201cYou stay here.\u201dHuang Qianjun turned to look, only to see calm indifference in Su Yi\u2019s gaze, as well as a cold glint.His heart shook.\u201cWhere\u2019s your young master?\u201d Su Yi strode forward, composed as ever. He hadn\u2019t cared about the blacksmiths\u2019 taunts, as in his eyes, they were nothing but ants, unworthy of his consideration.But the Apricot Clinic was different; this was\u00a0his\u00a0territory. They\u2019d come to antagonize him on his own turf. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t care!\u201cCome with me.\u201d The man in black glanced at him coldly, then turned and strode into the clinic.Su Yi followed, while the other guards stuck close to him, keeping him under close watch as if afraid he\u2019d run away.Brother Su plans to handle this himself, huh\u2026.?\u00a0Just as Huang Qianjun was about to take action, he recalled Su Yi\u2019s orders and stopped in his tracks.\u00a0I have to follow his commands, but if I just stand here doing nothing, won\u2019t I look completely useless\u2026.?Huang Qianjun sank into thought. He wasn\u2019t worried about Su Yi\u2019s wellbeing; he was just lamenting his inability to go watch the show\u2026.Before long, he seemed to reach a decision. He turned and left.Meanwhile, within the Apricot Clinic.Hu Quan, Wu Guangbin and the others were all present, but all of their brows were tightly knit with worry.When they saw Su Yi step through the door, their expressions changed.Su Yi had only taken up the clinic\u2019s management yesterday, but\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changqing\u2019s son, Wen Jieyuan, was already here to make trouble. Every member of the clinic\u2019s staff sensed that Su Yi was in for a hard time.Hu Quan hurriedly called out a warning, \u201cSir, you mustn\u2019t clash with Young Master Wen Jieyuan! Retreat just this once; there\u2019s a boundless future ahead of you.\u201dSu Yi neither\u00a0agreed\u00a0nor\u00a0disagreed. He simply nodded. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alright.\u201dHu Quan wanted to say something, only for the man in black to push him away. \u201cThis is none of your business. All of you, wait over there!\u201dThen, he led Su Yi straight to the courtyard behind the clinic.\u00a0Hu Quan and the rest of the staff watched them leave, then looked at each other and sighed.\u00a0They deeply admired Su Yi\u2019s medical skills, but this time, it was the Wen Family that had come looking for trouble. They were in no position to get involved.The courtyard behind the Apricot Clinic.Wen Jueyuan stood with his hands behind his back, beside the locust tree. He was staring intently at the chained-up well, his brow tightly furrowed. A long time passed before he spoke.\u201cNine years ago, the wandering Daoist Wu Ruoqiu said that any living person who takes up residence in that courtyard would be devoured by the ghosts living in the well. Why, then, is Su Yi still alive?\u201d Wen Jieyuan was baffled.He\u2019d come here this morning. He\u2019d initially planned to see just how gruesomely Su Yi had died. Who would have guessed that no such thing had happened?Su Yi was still alive and well!\u201cYoung Master, we brought Su Yi.\u201d Su Yi, the man in black, and the rest of the guards walked into the courtyard.Slam!The gates shut, and the guards dispersed, taking up posts nearby.\u00a0Their cold gazes bore into Su Yi, as if he were prey that had walked right into their trip.Wen Jieyuan stood beside the well, clad in white. When Su Yi arrived, he turned to face him, asking, \u201cTell me, when you stayed here last night, did anything strange happen?\u201dHis tone was pushy and forceful, as if he were giving orders.Seth's ThoughtsDid I discuss this earlier? I don\u2019t think I did. Just in case, here\u2019s a quick note about honorifics: the word both the staff and the guards are using to address Su Yi, \u201c\u59d1\u7237\u201d, is used for sons-in-law, but it\u2019s more something you call the son-in-law of your master\u2019s house than something you\u2019d call your own son-in-law. There\u2019s no direct English equivalent.I always try to strike a balance between staying true to the raws and producing smooth, comprehensible English. Usually there\u2019s no conflict, but in this case, there is. I\u2019ve decided to translate this term differently based on context and intended nuance. I\u2019ll do something similar for other honorifics with no obvious English equivalent.For this specific honorific, I\u2019ve been translating \u59d1\u7237 \u00a0as \u201cWen Family Son-in-Law\u201d when the speaker is emphasizing his position or being sarcastic/hurtful (ie trying to remind him that he\u2019s just a live-in son-in-law), but \u201csir\u201d when it\u2019s used more neutrally/respectfully. I could probably use \u201cyoung master\u201d there too, although I feel like we have enough young masters floating around already. ;)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - I Enter the Mortal World and Sharpen My Heart Like the Edge of My BladeWen Jieyuan bore down on him, putting on airs.Su Yi just swept his gaze across the courtyard, and when he saw that nothing was damaged, he said lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s true that quite a few strange things happened here last night, but\u2026 What does that have to do with you?\u201dWen Jieyuan\u2019s\u00a0brow\u00a0scrunched up, and he laughed, \u201cSu Yi, you wretch of a live-in son-in-law, you\u2019ve only managed the Apricot Clinic for one day, yet your temper\u2019s already grown this much?\u201dThe guards laughed coldly along with him.\u00a0They worked for the Wen Family. Over the past year, who among them hadn\u2019t heard how worthless and pathetic Su Yi was?They didn\u2019t take him the least bit seriously!Wen Jieyuan continued disdainfully, \u201cOr is that you think, as her \u2018husband\u2019, you can take advantage of Lingzhao becoming a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple to improve your situation?\u201cLet me tell you: even if I killed you here and now, Cousin Lingzhao wouldn\u2019t avenge you!\u201d As he said this, there was a hint of pity in his gaze.Su Yi\u2019s expression only grew calmer. Suddenly, he asked, \u201cDo you know Wu Ruoqiu?\u201dWen Jieyuan was suddenly serious. \u201cDid you meet that wandering Daoist last night?\u201dSu Yi instantly understood. \u201cJust as I thought. You and your father have long since known about the courtyard\u2019s dangers. Had anyone else spent the night here, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019d have died already.\u201dWen Jieyuan fell silent. Suddenly, he burst into laughter, a strange look in his eyes. \u201cSu Yi, you were supposed to die last night, but then, it\u2019s not too late.\u201dHe waved, his voice cold and indifferent. \u201cKill him!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The guards scattered throughout the courtyard responded immediately, surrounding Su Yi, their gazes icy and murderous.\u00a0\u201cMy apologies, \u2018Young Master\u2019!\u201dClang!A short but bulky man drew his iron shortsword, then launched himself off the ground like an arrow\u00a0loosed\u00a0from its bowstring. He hurtled straight towards Su Yi\u2019s back.The shortsword slashed a perfectly vertical streak of sword light, fast as lightning.Su Yi didn\u2019t so much as shift positions, but his sheathed sword whipped behind him.The sheath slammed into the short, bulky man\u2019s chest when the shortsword was just half a foot from Su Yi\u2019s back.Crunch!The attack looked casual, but it was incomparably overbearing. The stocky guard\u2019s ribs shattered and his chest caved in.He screamed in agony, but before he could react, the sheath rose and slammed into his neck.The Blood Circulation Realm, Refining Muscle Stage elite guard fell, knees slamming to the ground with a thud, his neck broken and his head hanging limply. He breathed no more.It happened in an instant, and throughout the entire process, the sword never left its sheath, nor did Su Yi turn to face his foe. He\u2019d killed him facing the opposite direction, without even looking at him!Everyone in the courtyard was horrified.\u201cThat cripple recovered his cultivation!?\u201d Standing beside the well, Wen Jieyuan\u2019s expression darkened.A year ago, the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, Su Yi, lost his cultivation, then married into a Wen Family as a cripple. Everyone in Guangling City knew that.Yet now, Su Yi had effortlessly slaughtered a Blood Circulation Realm cultivator!\u201cAll of you, attack at once!\u201d The man in black shouted coldly. He was the captain of this group of guards. He was tall and lean, and his eyes flashed. He\u2019d been immersed in the \u201cRefining Sinew\u201d stage for a long time, and he had ample combat experience.Even as he gave his orders, he led the way forward. He raised a three-foot mace over his head and swung.Whoosh!Fierce winds tore through the air with an ear-piercing howl.The other seven guards raised axes, blades, tridents, and various other weapons, then charged as one.Based purely on the murderous intent emanating from them, it was obvious that they were ruthless and long accustomed to bloodshed.Although he was surrounded, Su Yi gazed only at his sword. He whispered, \u201cAlright then. Today, I\u2019ll baptize you in their blood.\u201dEven as his whisper echoed throughout the courtyard\u2026.Clang!A streak of sword light shot forth, and the sword, its blade as dark as night and gleaming with faint purple hues, rose into the air. The metal hummed, as if clamoring for a feast of fresh blood.The sword was called \u201cMortal Edge.\u201d The name came from the phrase \u201cI enter the mortal world and sharpen my heart like the edge of my blade.\u201dClang!Mortal Edge\u2019s sword light swept across the man in black\u2019s mace, which cracked, then split in half as if it were made of tofu.The sword\u2019s edge was far too sharp and despotic!One swing of the blade, and he cut through both the mace and its wielder\u2019s right arm. A waterfall of blood gushed from the stump, bright red and piping hot.The man let out a low grunt and retreated in terror, only to see an incomparably bloody scene play out before him.Su Yi\u2019s sleeves billowed. He gripped his sword, glanced to the sides like a fallen immortal, and struck six times in rapid succession.Cut, stab, sweep, slice, burst, split!Every swing of his sword was fast as the wind and destructive as fire. The scattered attacks were unrestrained, as ethereal as lightning and fleeting as light.Su Yi resembled a cyclone towering into the nine heavens, wanton and unbridled.Thud!One of the guards collapsed, eyes wide with shock, a bloody hole through his throat.Splurt!Another guard\u2019s head flew from his shoulders and into the air, his face a mask of lingering terror.A rapid series of collisions and muffled thuds followed. Some of the guards were hacked to pieces. Others had their throats cut or their chests sliced open\u2026.Fresh blood burst like a display of bright red fireworks, beautiful yet violent, blooming in the skies above the courtyard.When Su Yi stopped and sheathed his sword, everyone but the black-robed captain and Wen Jieyuan had perished. Blood flowed like a river.This was just like the silence following a sudden crack of thunder.Su Yi just stood there, as calm as ever, sword in hand, utterly at ease. The blade was as dark as the night, and it dripped with blood.He stood surrounded by seven fresh, still-bleeding corpses, a bloody spectacle.\u201cThat\u2026 What kind of sword technique is that?\u201d The black-robed man was shocked out of his wits. He was dazed, and his eyes were bewildered; he was completely intimidated.Wen Jieyuan was stunned too. He trembled in both terror and fury, and his eyes filled with disbelief.\u201cIf you nourish your sword with slaughter, it grows ferocious. If you temper it in blood, it develops a baleful aura. It\u2019s best to polish your sword with your Dao Heart. But then, although Mortal Edge has a hint of spirituality, it\u2019s ultimately just a mortal weapon. The taint of bloodlust won\u2019t harm it.\u201dSu Yi glanced at Mortal Edge, then at Wen Jieyuan. \u201cYou\u2019re an \u2018esteemed disciple\u2019 of the Wen Family,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare fight me?\u201dWen Jieyuan felt a chill course through him.He was only in the Blood Circulation Realm\u2019s Refining Muscle stage, and he\u2019d been pampered from a young age. He\u2019d never seen such a bloody spectacle in his life, and he was already scared out of his mind.\u201cYoung Master, run! Hurry!\u201d Suddenly, the nearby man in black shouted, pulled out a crossbow, and aimed it at Su Yi.Whoosh!An arrow shot out like lightning, its glint bitingly sharp.Su Yi shifted to the side, dodging with just three inches between the arrow and his throat. The arrowhead thudded into the courtyard\u2019s walls, leaving a deep hole and scattering fragments of stone.From this, it was clear how powerful the arrow was!Wen Jieyuan had already come to his senses, and he seized this opportunity to flee the courtyard.The man in black held his crossbow and rewound it, pulling the trigger and loosing one arrow after another.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The sharp arrowheads stirred up howling winds as they shot through the air in rapid succession, straight towards Su Yi, as concentrated as a downpour.Su Yi didn\u2019t retreat. Instead, he advanced, flickering and shifting, allowing the arrows to slip right past him.He was already at the Refining Sinew stage. He moved like an arrow and landed as gently as the wind, nimble as could be.Even though he walked amidst a rain of arrows, he seemed calm and composed, dodging each incoming arrow by a hair.In the blink of an eye, he arrived before the man in black, entirely uninjured, not even a single hair out of place.\u201cIf you do this, you\u2019ll only hurt yourself!\u201d The man in black shouted. He\u2019d already used up all his arrows, and as Su Yi drew near, he couldn\u2019t help but despair.Strong!Too strong!So strong that even a Refining Sinew expert like him felt terror and helplessness rise from deep within his heart.\u201cYou saved your master out of loyalty. That\u2019s worthy of praise, so I\u2019ll give you a clean death.\u201d With that, the tip of Su Yi\u2019s sword flashed.Splurt!The sword went straight through the man\u2019s chest, destroying his heart.In the last moments before his death, he couldn\u2019t believe how fast and efficient Su Yi\u2019s movements were. It seemed he wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned about how grave the consequences of his actions might be.The man in black thudded to the ground and collapsed in a puddle of blood.But Su Yi had already fixed his gaze elsewhere.Wen Jieyuan had already reached the gates, as frantic and terrified as a dog after losing its master.How could Su Yi let him escape so easily?With a flick of his toes, a shortsword flew into the air and landed in his palm.\u00a0His arms surged with power, and he flung it.Swoosh!The shortsword flew like an arrow, fast and ruthless as lightning, then sunk straight into Wen Jieyuan\u2019s back.\u00a0The combination of agonizing pain and overwhelming terror put Wen Jieyuan on the verge of collapse.\u201cIf I\u2019d known this would happen, I wouldn\u2019t have had them lock the gates\u2026.\u201d Wen Jieyuan\u2019s\u00a0expression filled\u00a0with despair.But it was then that\u2014Someone opened the gates from the outside, and a group appeared just beyond the courtyard.The leader was a hulking, mountainous figure in armor and warrior\u2019s robes. When he opened his eyes, they seemed to crackle with electricity.This was none other than the commander of the city lord\u2019s guards, Nie Beihu.\u201cCommander Nie, save me!\u201d Wen Jieyuan had only just despaired, but now, he was mad with delight. He screamed for help, like a drowning man clutching at straws.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Nie Beihu\u2019s gaze swept across the courtyard. The sight of so many fresh, bloodied corpses surprised even him. His expression shifted, and he sucked in a cold breath of air.Huang Qianjun and a group of guards had followed him in, and the bloody spectacle shocked them, too. Their nerves went taut.Then, their gazes landed on the solitary figure standing amidst the carnage: Su Yi.They couldn\u2019t calm down. It was obvious to all of them that he was responsible for all this bloodshed!\u201cCommander Nie, hurry! Hurry and capture that villain Su Yi! He\u2019s on a murderous rampage. He killed all my attendants, and he wants to kill me too!\u201d Wen Jieyuan cried out, both bitter and frantic.He\u2019d been at the banquet a few days ago, and he saw Nie Beihu and Fu Shan make an appearance. He instinctively assumed that since Nie Beihu was on good terms with the Wen Family, he\u2019d back him up.But what happened next left him stunned.Nie Biehu suddenly came to his senses, clasped his fist, and greeted Su Yi. \u201cI apologize for my late arrival, Young Lord Su, and humbly request your forgiveness.\u201d\u201cCommander Nie, you\u2026 How could you\u2026.\u201d Wen Jieyuan felt as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning. He was tongue-tied, and his eyes bulged. He was too shocked to even speak properly.Nie Beihu ignored him, his expression indifferent. He just looked at Su Yi with utter respect.Su Yi furrowed his brow, then glanced at Huang Qianjun. \u201cDid you invite Commander Nie here?\u201dHuang Qianjun froze. He could tell that Su Yi was displeased, and he broke into cold sweats.\u00a0He wanted to explain, but in the end, he could only lower his head and grimace. \u201cYes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - Black-Hearted Nie BeihuHuang Qianjun lowered his head and admitted it without any attempts to explain himself.Su Yi\u2019s expression softened a little. \u201cI\u2019ll let it go this time.\u201dWhen Huang Qianjun heard this, his tension relaxed, and his face filled with gratitude. \u201cBrother Su, don\u2019t worry! I won\u2019t try anything clever again!\u201dWhen Nie Beihu saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion.\u00a0Huang Yunchong, you old fox! What a clever move! So long as your son follows Young Lord Su, what need is there to worry about his future? He\u2019s sure to make something of himself!When I get back, I\u2019ll have to have my son get closer to Young Lord Su too!Then, he solemnly cupped his fist. \u201cYoung Lord Su, City Lord Fu told me days ago that your problems are his problems. So, tell me\u2026. How should we resolve this?\u201dWen Jieyuan was the son of Wen Changqing, while Su Yi was the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law. There was now a blood feud between the two of them. If they didn\u2019t handle this well, it could cause enormous turmoil.Before Su Yi could respond, Wen Jieyuan struggled to turn and face him. He kowtowed, pleading at the top of his lungs, \u201cSu Yi, I was wrong! I was wrong! I\u2019ll never do it again, so please, spare me just this once! I swear I won\u2019t tell anyone what happened here!\u201dHe trembled from head to toe, his eyes wide with terror.Even an idiot would have realized the situation wasn\u2019t looking good, so he immediately changed his tune.But what happened next was beyond everyone\u2019s expectations\u2014Huang Qianjun suddenly stepped forward, grabbed the knife in Wen Jieyuan\u2019s back, and shoved it in.Splurt!The sharp blade pierced right through Wen Jieyuan, its sharp tip emerging from his chest with a spray of blood.Wen Jieyuan\u2019s eyes widened, and his jaw dropped. He thudded limply to the ground.The knife Su Yi had thrown wasn\u2019t enough to deal a fatal blow, but Huang Qianjun\u2019s attack directly severed his life.Nie Beihu and the nearby guards were stunned. They never would have guessed that the one to kill Wen Jieyuan would be the silkpants, Huang Qianjun.Even Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up; he hadn\u2019t expected this either.Huang Qianjun\u2019s chest heaved, his breathing ragged. He pulled the knife out, splattering blood all over himself.But it was as if he didn\u2019t notice. He lowered his head, not daring to meet Su Yi\u2019s gaze, then said hoarsely, \u201cBrother Su, I did something conceited again.\u201dSu Yi stared deeply at him, then said \u201cWash the blood off your face, then come back.\u201dFor a moment, Huang Qianjun was dazed. Then he said in surprise, \u201cBrother Su, you\u2019re not mad at me? But just now, I\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need to say more. I understand.\u201d Su Yi waved him away.Huang Qianjun broke into a grin, then rushed off to clean himself up.Huang Qianjun, that kid! He\u2019s ruthless, brave, and he really went all out. That attack was the pinnacle of perfection!With this,\u00a0he\u2019s made\u00a0himself Su Yi\u2019s co-conspirator and announced his loyalty through his actions. He clearly\u00a0won himself Young\u00a0Lord Su\u2019s approval, too.Nie Beihu couldn\u2019t help but sigh to himself.\u00a0Why didn\u2019t I realize that this domineering silkpants was so crafty and brave?Had Su Yi dealt Wen Jieyuan the final blow, it would have inevitably led to direct conflict with the Wen Family.By choosing that moment to attack, Huang Qianjun had effectively redirected all the trouble onto himself.Even if the Wen\u00a0Family\u00a0found out what had happened, they\u2019d look to Huang Qianjun for revenge.This was the risk and sacrifice Huang Qianjun accepted when he pushed in the knife.But in doing so, he\u2019d really and truly won Su Yi\u2019s approval!Nie Beihu was ruthless and experienced. How could he possibly miss what was happening here?That was why he sighed with so much emotion.He asked himself, had he been in Huang Qianjun\u2019s shoes, could he have made the same choice? Maybe, but he would likely have hesitated. He couldn\u2019t have been so quick or decisive.Nie Beihu clasped his fist. \u201cYoung Lord Su, this is the Apricot Clinic, and numerous people saw Wen Jieyuan enter. Today, both he and his guards lost their lives here. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to keep this incident a secret.\u201dHe paused, then said decisively, \u201cBut you can rest assured that I will do everything in my power to resolve this incident!\u201dWen Jieyuan\u2019s status wasn\u2019t simple; he was the son of the main-line elder Wen Changqing. Someone of Nie Beihu\u2019s status would encounter numerous thorny problems if he tried to resolve this.But he nevertheless accepted this responsibility.His reasoning was simple: he had City Lord Fu Shan behind him, and behind Fu Shan was the Spiritjade Marchioness!WIth a clang, Su Yi sheathed his sword and said lightly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to go to such trouble. If Wen Changqing asks, just tell him that they fell at the hands of Wu Ruoqiu of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate.\u201dThis was shifting the blame.The best part was that Wen Changqing undoubtedly already knew of Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s existence, and at least a little about the courtyard.No one would doubt them if they pinned his son\u2019s death on Wu Ruoqiu and the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate.\u201cThe Deathbringer\u2019s Gate? Wu Ruoqiu?\u201d Nie Beihu was dazed; it was obvious he\u2019d never heard of that organization or of Wu Ruoqiu.Something occurred to Su Yi, and he immediately explained how Wu Ruoqiu had been using the courtyard as a Ghoul Worm farm.\u201cBrilliant!\u201d When Nie Beihu heard this explanation, he couldn\u2019t help but applaud.Wu Ruoqiu was undoubtedly the perfect scapegoat to pin the murders on!Su Yi said gravely, \u201cCommander Nie, remember to tell the city lord. Have him investigate and see if there are any similar \u2018haunted houses\u2019 in Giangling City. After all, now that Wu Ruoqiu is dead, there\u2019s no one left to feed the worms. When they get hungry, they\u2019re certain to charge into the city and bring disaster to the citizens.\u201dNie Beihu instantly grew solemn. He cupped his fists. \u201cYoung Lord Su, I admire your consideration and your benevolence. We\u2019ll be certain to make this our top priority!\u201dWith that, he turned to his guards and said, \u201cClean up the corpses. I don\u2019t care how you do it, but make absolutely certain that you don\u2019t leave any clues that might disadvantage Young Lord Su. Do you hear me?\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The guards acknowledged their orders and got to work.They\u2019d worked for the City Lord\u2019s Manor for years. They were elites accustomed to bloodshed, the type to lick the blood off their swords, and they had ample experience resolving such matters. They were ruthless and efficient.By the time Huang Qianjun finished washing off the blood and returned, the courtyard was spotless. Wen Jieyuan and the guards\u2019 corpses had disappeared, as if they\u2019d vanished into thin air.Even the rivers of blood staining the ground were gone without a trace!Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cCommander Nie, why do I get the sense that this isn\u2019t the first time you and the Old Guard have done this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just killing people and destroying the corpses, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Nie Beihu offhandedly. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as could be. I\u2019m not bragging when I say that after the Old Guard finishes cleaning a murder scene, not even the Huang Family would be able to find the slightest thread of evidence.\u201dAs he spoke, his gaze swept across his subordinates. \u201cEveryone, you know what to do regarding today\u2019s incident, don\u2019t you?\u201dThe guards burst into laughter.One of them said, \u201cSir, let\u2019s go by our usual rules. Treat us to three rounds of drinks, and we guarantee our lips are sealed. It\u2019ll be as if none of this ever happened!\u201dNie Beihu nodded.Su Yi glanced at Huang Qianjun. \u201cYou foot the bill for their drinks.\u201dHuang Qianjun hurriedly pounded his chest. \u201cRelax, Brother Su! Leave it all to me!\u201dNie Beihu couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u00a0Su Yi ordering Huang Qianjun to treat the guards was undoubtedly his way of expressing approval for this arrangement.That was enough!Nie Beihu thought about it, then whispered a recommendation, \u201cYoung Lord Su, I\u2019ve already sent people to request Wen Changqing\u2019s presence. When he gets here, all you have to do is watch.\u201dSu Yi nodded.Time flew by.\u00a0A full hour passed before a group rushed through the courtyard gates.Their leader was a glaring, pale-faced, whiskerless man. This was none other than the Wen Family\u2019s Second Elder, Wen Changqing.However, his frantic concern and heavy heart were written on his face. The second he stepped into the courtyard, he said in a low voice, \u201cCommander Nie, where is my son? Where are his guards?\u201dNie Beihu\u2019s expression filled with grief, and he said hoarsely, \u201cBrother Changqing, when I got here, it was already too late. I\u2019m afraid your son and his attendants\u00a0were\u00a0already dead.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d Wen Changqing reacted as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning, and his eyes threatened to pop out of their sockets. \u201cWho was it? Who killed my son?\u201dHis vicious gaze swept across everyone in the courtyard, like an infuriated beast looking for someone to devour.He had two children. Wen Jieyuan was his eldest son, and he was in the prime of his youth. Wen Changjing had poured his heart and soul into training him.\u00a0He\u2019d planned to send Wen Jieyuan to Blueriver Sword Manor in the near future.Who would have thought that his son would die before he got the chance?\u201cMy condolences, Brother Changqing.\u201d Nie Beihu\u2019s face filled with mourning, and he sighed. \u201cNone of us could have guessed that malevolent apparitions hid within the courtyard. That heretical Daoist, Wu Ruoqiu, was even more vicious; he summoned evil insects called \u2018Ghoul Worms\u2019 to devour your son and his guards whole\u2026.\u201d\u201cWu Ruoqiu\u2026. Wu Ruoqiu\u2026.\u201d Wen Changqing\u2019s expression shifted dramatically, and the veins\u00a0bulged\u00a0on his forehead. \u201cThat blasted wandering Daoist! I thought of him as my friend, yet he dared murder my son?!\u201dSuddenly, he glanced at Su Yi, as if realizing something.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThat waste spent the night without being attacked, so why is my son dead?\u201dHe was both stunned and angry, and he\u2019d sensed that something fishy was going on.Instead of answering him, Nie Beihu looked stunned. \u201cBrother Changqing, you\u2019re saying you know the heretical cultivator Wu Ruoqiu? And you\u00a0knew\u00a0this residence was haunted and dangerous?\u201dThe nearby guards were in uproar. They played along, shouting and clamoring. All of them glared at Wen Changqing and shouted questions.\u201cWen Changqing, you dared leave that evildoer to wreak havoc?\u201d\u201cI never would have guessed that the Wen Family would commit such dark, heretical acts behind closed doors. Simply unforgivable!\u201d\u201cThe Wen Family has been consorting with the heretical cultivator Wu Ruoqiu of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate! I\u2019ll have to inform City Lord Fu Shan of this!\u201d\u2026..The pain of losing his son made Wen Changqing mad with anger, but when he heard the guards\u2019 questions and rebukes, he felt a chill run down his spine, as if someone had poured cold water over his head. This helped him calm down.He took a deep breath, his expression unsightly as he tried to explain. \u201cCommander Nie, if I were in cahoots with Wu Ruoqiu, why would he kill my son?\u201d\u201cHow about this?\u201d said Nie Beihu coldly. \u201cYou and I will pay City Lord Fu Shan a visit and have him uphold justice. If you\u2019re innocent, you\u2019ll naturally be free to leave without charges!\u201dWen Changqing froze, and his chest heaved violently.Before he could make up his mind, Nie Beihu waved to his subordinates. \u201cCome! Escort Wen Changqing to the city lord\u2019s manor!\u201dWhen he saw this, Huang Qianjun, who\u2019d been playing the part of a spectator, couldn\u2019t help but gasp.I\u2019ve seen my fair share of wickedness, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone this black-hearted!He isn\u2019t just making the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate and Wu Ruoqiu take the fall for this; he\u2019s even seizing this chance to drag Wen Changqing off.How wicked!If he makes it to the city lord\u2019s estate, given City Lord Fu Shan\u2019s relationship with Su Yi, Wen Changqing is doomed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - If Everyone Consents, Why Shouldn\u2019t I?The Old Guard surrounded Wen Changqing, their gazes boring into him.Wen Changqing clearly sensed that this didn\u2019t bode well for him, and he was a bit frantic.\u201cCommander Nie, given your connections with the Wen Family, you ought to know that I, Wen Changqing, am not that debase or despicable!\u201d He took a deep breath, then said solemnly, \u201cI only just received the grievous news of my son\u2019s passing, so I lost control of my emotions and said some things I shouldn\u2019t have. I humbly request your understanding.\u201dNie Beihu fell silent, then said, \u201cBrother Changqing, if you want to prove your innocence, there\u2019s just one thing you need to do.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Wen Changqing.\u201cUse the power of the Wen Family to assist the City Lord\u2019s Manor in rooting out any clues regarding Wu Ruoqiu. We cannot allow evildoers like him to bring disaster to the populace. I trust City Lord Fu would appreciate your assistance.\u201dNie Beihu\u2019s words were sonorant and eloquent.\u201cThat\u2019s only natural!\u201d Wen Changqing didn\u2019t even need to stop to think. His expression filled with dense hatred, and he gnashed his teeth. \u201cWu Ruoqiu killed my son! I\u2019d love nothing more than to rip him to shreds and eat him alive! Commander Nie, please rest assured. The Wen Family is duty-bound to investigate and pursue that fiend!\u201dNie Beihu\u2019s expression softened, and he waved his guards away. \u201cBrother Changqing, there\u2019s something I\u2019m not sure I ought to say or not.\u201d\u201cCommander Nie, please enlighten me.\u201d\u201cYou were obviously well aware that this residence was haunted, yet you didn\u2019t warn Young Lord Su. If word of this spreads, I\u2019m afraid it will bring you much criticism,\u201d said Nie Beihu. \u201cThe uninformed might well assume that the Wen Family intended to use the haunted house to get rid of him.\u201dWen Changqing\u2019s expression changed dramatically, and he immediately denied it. \u201cHow could I? I, Wen Changqing, would never do something so shameless and despicable!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll inform City Lord Fu Shan of this,\u201d said Nie Beihu gravely. \u201cFurthermore, allow me to be blunt: if anything else goes wrong during Young Lord Su\u2019s stay here, the Wen Family won\u2019t be able to escape responsibility.\u201dWen Changqing\u2019s lips twitched, and he forced a rigid smile. \u201cCommander Nie, please rest assured.\u201dFinally, Nie Beihu nodded. He glanced\u00a0inscrutably\u00a0at Su Yi, then waved. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201dWith that, he left, taking the Old Guard with him.Wen Changqing stood in place, silent for a long time.Suddenly, he whipped around and stared intently at Su Yi, his gaze terrifyingly dark as he pressed for answers. \u201cWhat happened just now?\u201dSu Yi said calmly, \u201cYour son arrived two hours before I did. How could I possibly know what happened before I got here?\u201dHe paused, then furrowed his brow. \u201cI wanted to ask you something too. I\u2019ve already taken over management of the Apricot Clinic, so why was your son here?\u201dWen Changqing flitted back and forth.Su Yi\u2019s questions were perfectly reasonable, leaving him unable to interrogate him any further.A little while later, he stretched out a finger and pointed at Su Yi, his expression dark and imposing. When he spoke, he paused for emphasis between each word. \u201cI\u2019ll get to the bottom of this! Don\u2019t let me find out you had something to do with this!\u201dWith that, he turned and led his attendants away.Huang Qianjun watched them disappear. Only when they faded from view did Huang Qianjun\u00a0sigh\u00a0with admiration. \u201cCommander Nie, your methods sure are something!\u201dSu Yi glanced at him. \u201cThe machinations of power and authority are ultimately just petty tricks. Some truly powerful cultivators could have called upon their unique secret arts to recreate the murder scene.\u201dHe paused, as if worried that Huang Qianjun didn\u2019t understand, then added, \u201cIf you want to become strong, you can\u2019t put too much energy into mental games.\u201dHuang Qianjun froze, then said solemnly, \u201cBrother Su, you\u2019re right!\u201dInwardly, he was mad with delight.\u00a0Brother Su gave me pointers again! This is a wonderful sign!\u201cTomorrow morning, wait for me ten miles outside the city, in the mulberry grove lining the Great Azure.\u201d Su Yi casually commanded him, then turned and entered his room.In his eyes, what just happened was a minor interlude, unworthy of any further concern.Ten miles outside the city? A grove on the banks of the Great Azure? What\u2019s he bringing me there for?\u00a0Huang Qianjun was a bit confused, but he shook his head, cast those thoughts aside, and ran off.He\u2019d just killed Wen Jieyuan with his own two hands. He needed to inform his father, Huang Yunchong, right away.The courtyard regained its usual tranquility.The sunlight passed through the locust tree\u2019s lush umbrella of leaves, casting mottled flecks of light on the ground.Shortly after Huang Qianjun left, Hu Quan, Wu Guangbin, and the rest of the clinic\u2019s staff paid Su Yi a visit. When they saw that he was alive and well, they finally relaxed, and before long, they were on their way.Su Yi sat before his desk, holding Mortal Edge in front of him and examining it in silence.The sword had just killed eight people. There was no trace of blood on the solid, inky darkness of the blade, but its edges carried a faint baleful aura.\u201cThis is ultimately just a mortal weapon, with little space to grow. Still, at least in the short run, it\u2019ll do just fine.\u201d Finally, Su Yi resheathed Mortal Edge, then glanced at the yellow Soul-Nurturing Gourd hanging from the desk.As if sensing his gaze, Qing Wan\u2019s timid voice rang out. \u201cMystic Master, you\u2026 Do you have orders for me?\u201dHer voice was soft and sticky, pure and sweet.\u201cCome on out. I have something to discuss with you.\u201d Su Yi gently drummed his fingers against the desk. He already had a plan for what he\u2019d do with Qing Wan.A wisp of white smoke emerged silently from the gourd, and Qing Wan\u2019s petite figure drifted into view, stunning in her redding dress.She had youthful features and big eyes, and she hovered there, quivering, head held low, looking a bit silly.Su Yi muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll give you two choices. First, after I step into the Origin Dao, I\u2019ll redeem your soul and release you from this world.\u201dQing Wan fidgeted with the hems of her dress and asked weakly, \u201cAnd the second choice, Mystic Master?\u201d\u201cThe second choice is simple. We\u2019ll make a deal.\u201d He rubbed his lower jaw and gazed at her, as if from a distance. \u201cI\u2019ll grant you a cultivation technique and help you become a true ghost cultivator. In exchange, you\u2019ll need to agree to my request.\u201d\u201cWhat is it you need from me?\u201d She looked up, an expectant look on her youthful, slightly chubby face.\u201cUse your body as my furnace,\u201d he said offhandedly. \u201cAccompany me once in dual cultivation as I step from the Origin Dao and into the Spirit Dao.\u201dThere were four great stages of cultivation: the Martial Dao, Origin Dao, Spirit Dao, and Profound Dao. Each was subdivided into different realms.The Martial Dao included the Blood Circulation, Qi Accumulation, Inner Furnace, and An\u0101srava Realms.The Origin Dao included Grain Avoidance, Origin Palace, and Gathering Stars Realms.Above that were the Three Realms of the Spirit Dao.Of them, the first was called \u201cthe Spiritual Manifestation Realm\u201d.Upon reaching this stage, it was necessary to convert one\u2019s origin power into a \u201cSpiritual Origin\u201d, in which Yin and Yang intermingled.Based on the experience of his past life, he knew that if he wanted to exceed his past self as he stepped into the Spiritual Manifestation Realm, dual cultivation was an excellent way to go about it.Of course, even without dual cultivation, he had other ways of taking that step. It would just take more effort, and he\u2019d have to search for an opportunity.But if he started nurturing Qing Wan as his future \u201cfurnace\u201d now, when the time came to enter the Spiritual Manifestation Realm, he wouldn\u2019t need to go to all that trouble.\u201cDual\u2026. Dual cultivation?\u201d Qing Wanstammered in obvious shock. Then, her fair features flushed crimson. Her rosy cheeks were now so red, they looked like they were burning.Her eyelashes quivered, and she buried her head in her chest, looking bashful as could be.Su Yi continued, sounding so calm, it was as if none of this had anything to do with him. \u201cThat\u2019s right. If you agree, when the time comes, I can teach you a unique dual cultivation technique. It won\u2019t drain you, nor will it harm your origin. On the contrary, your cultivation will go up a notch too.\u201dHe paused, then said, \u201cOf course, if you\u2019re unwilling, that\u2019s fine too. I\u2019m not so desperate as to take advantage of a little yin spirit like you.\u201dIn his past life, had he announced that he wanted a dual dultivation partner, immortal beauties and goddesses would have swarmed to his door like moths to a flame.After all, dual cultivating with Su Xuanjun was an enormous stroke of good fortune to any woman intent on reaching greater heights in their pursuit of the Dao. It was an opportunity that could be found but not sought!Could Qing Wan understand that? Maybe not, but Su Yi didn\u2019t care.In any event, the Spiritual Manifestation Realm was still far away.\u201cThink it over. There\u2019s no rush to answer me,\u201d said Su Yi. With that, he got up and turned to leave.But before he got far, Qing Wan called him back. She sounded flustered. \u201cMystic Master, I\u2026. I\u2019ve decided.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up, and he asked with great interest. \u201cWhat did you choose?\u201d\u201cThe\u2026 the second option.\u201d Her voice was as soft as a gnat, only barely audible, and her beautiful face was bright red. She didn\u2019t even dare meet Su Yi\u2019s gaze.Su Yi really didn\u2019t understand it.\u00a0She\u2019s just a yin spirit. Why is she so bashful?He thought about it, then said, \u201cOnce you decide, you can\u2019t go back on your word. Do you understand?\u201dQing Wan\u2019s chest heaved; it was obvious she was nervous. She took several deep breaths before stammering, \u201cI understand.\u201dSu Yi continued, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m going to teach you a cultivation method, and although I\u2019ll give you pointers, I\u2019m not taking you as my apprentice, and you aren\u2019t allowed to refer to yourself as such. Understand?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Qing Wan nodded obediently.Su Yi pondered for a moment, then added, \u201cEven if you become my dual cultivation partner, you won\u2019t be my wife or concubine, and I won\u2019t take responsibility for you. Do you understand?\u201dQing Wan was stunned. Then, she stammered, \u201cMystic Master, there\u2019s no need to worry. I\u2026 I don\u2019t dare covet such things\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing this, Su Yi finally nodded in satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ll give you another day to think it over. If you haven\u2019t changed your mind by then, I\u2019ll teach you a cultivation technique.\u201dWith that, he rose, pushed open the door, and left. It was noon, and his stomach was rumbling. He needed to satisfy his hunger before he did anything else.As for what Qing Wan thought? He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to guess.It wasn\u2019t that he had a heart of stone. He wasn\u2019t emotionless, but he had the mental state and experience of his past life\u2019s hundred and eight thousand years. He\u2019d long detached himself from matters of love.If he was fated to encounter a woman who stole his heart, he\u2019d naturally treasure her and dote on her.If not, he wouldn\u2019t push the matter.As for dual cultivation, casual romances, one-night stands\u2026.If everyone consented, why shouldn\u2019t he enjoy himself?When Su Xuanjun conducted his affairs, he never let love or pleasure trouble him.Seth's Thoughts\u201c\u8f9f\u8c37\u201d, \u201cBigu\u201d, or \u00a0\u201cGrain Avoidance\u201d\u00a0is a Daoist concept.\u201cGrain Avoidance\u201d is a literal translation, but it doesn\u2019t fully convey the meaning of the term.\u201c\u8f9f\u8c37\u201d basically means \u201cto abstain from grain (ie the thing that constitutes the bulk of a normal mortal\u2019s diet) to achieve immortality\u201d. It\u2019s similar to Breatharianism, but Breatharianism is loosely associated with Hinduism, while \u201cGrain Avoidance\u201d has a more Daoist connotation.Apparently, in a more modern context, it\u2019s also used to describe keto-esque, low carb diets and intermittent fasting?I played with some alternative translations, but this is a standard term, not something the author made up or like\u2026 a generic fantasy word, y\u2019know? So let\u2019s just stick with \u201cGrain Avoidance.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - The Deathbringer\u2019s Tribulation, the Rejoicing SwordThe Huang Family.There were only two people within the clan\u2019s great hall\u2014Huang Yunchong and Huang Qianjun.When Huang Qianjun finished telling his father everything that had happened today, he couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous.Huang Yunchong sank into a lengthy silence. Then, he burst into laughter.His gratified, delighted laughter came straight from the heart, and it echoed throughout the hall for quite some time.Huang Qianjun instantly relaxed. Only then did he dare ask, \u201cFather, you think I did okay too?\u201dHuang Yunchong walked right up to him and pounded him on the shoulder, hard. \u201c\u2018Okay\u2019? You didn\u2019t do okay; you couldn\u2019t have done it any better! You\u2019ve got guts, kid! I\u2019m surprised!\u201dHuang Qianjun rubbed his aching shoulder and grinned. \u201cFather, I\u2019ve only followed Su Yi for two days, but you were right; I\u2019ve already learned a lot. I feel like I was wasting my life before.\u201d\u201cThat means you\u2019ve chosen the right person to follow.\u201d Huang Yunchong couldn't help but sigh. \u201cSu Yi is a hidden talent, but he\u2019s sure to reveal his true brilliance and ascend to the heavens sooner or later. If you follow him, you\u2019ll rise to prominence along with him!\u201d\u201cFather, I didn\u2019t think about any of that,\u201d said Huang Qianjun sheepishly. \u201cI just think that when I spend time with Brother Su, I often feel my horizons expanding.\u201dHuang Qianjun burst into laughter. \u201cMy child, having an attitude like that is for the best! Blind flattery will only make him think less of you, and you\u2019ll only lower yourself. Treating him with sincerity is the best policy!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but be delighted.As the head of the Huang Family, how could he miss the strength of Su Yi\u2019s network or his transcendent methods?His attainments in medicine made even the famed Wu Guangbin sigh with admiration.His skill at swordsmithing convinced even Wang Tianyang to call him \u2018grandmaster\u2019.And he even knew how to\u00a0exorcize\u00a0ghosts!Add all that to the mighty figures standing behind him: Fu Shan and the Spiritjade Marchioness, among others\u2026.Su Yi was like a hidden dragon! For his son to serve at his side was a blessing!\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about Wen Jieyuan\u2019s murder. Between Nie Beihu and Fu Shan, there\u2019s no way Wen Changqing will discover Su Yi\u2019s involvement.\u201d Huang Yunchong smiled. \u201cOn the contrary, it\u2019s entirely possible that Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s death and his connection to the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate will implicate the Wen Family. If so, it\u2019ll be a real headache for both Wen Changqing and Family Head Wen Changjing.\u201dHuang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cFather, have you heard of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate?\u201dHis father paused, as if trying to recall something. \u201cIt was about a hundred years ago. The Deathbringer\u2019s Gate was the top heretical faction in the Great Zhou, with vast numbers of disciples spread throughout the entire nation.\u201cThey sacrificed countless innocent lives in the name of cultivating their heretical arts, inviting the wrath of god and man alike. They were universally despised.\u201cIn the end, the imperial family of the Great Zhou sent a group of Earthly Immortals from our number one holy land, the Hidden Dragon Sword Sect, to join forces with the nobility and root them out. It took three years, but in the end, the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate fell, vanishing into thin air.\u201cThat incident was called \u2018the Deathbringer\u2019s Tribulation\u2019.\u201cFrom that day forth, the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate ceased to exist. Although numerous evildoers survived and scattered throughout the empire, it\u2019s difficult for them to gather in any meaningful way.\u201cNowadays, I\u2019m afraid that few people have ever so much as heard of them.\u201dHuang Qianjun finally understood. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that Wu Ruoqiu was a survivor of the Deathbringer\u2019s Tribulation? Or perhaps one of the remnant\u2019s disciples?\u201d\u201cMost likely, yes.\u201d Huang Yunchong nodded, then laughed coldly. \u201cThe Deathbringer\u2019s Gate has been gone for over a hundred years. There\u2019s no way of knowing just how this heretical faction recovered its vitality.\u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I dare say with certainty: the survivors only dare operate under the cover of darkness and behind closed doors, hiding away like mice for fear of discovery. If found, everyone would unite against them.\u201dHe paused, then continued, \u201cIf Wen Changqing has really known about Wu Ruoqiu for years, that\u2019s tantamount to colluding with the survivors of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate. A crime like that is enough to invite disaster upon the entire Wen Family!\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s eyes shone, and he gleefully rubbed his hands together. \u201cFather, when Fu Shan finds out about this, will he seize the opportunity to teach the Wen Family a lesson?\u201dHuang Yunchong fell silent for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cIn the past, such a discovery would have indeed dealt an enormous blow to the Wen Family, but it\u2019s different now.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cBecause the Wen Family is about to have a \u2018Grandmaster\u2019s disciple\u2019 among them!\u201d Despite himself, Huang Yunchong\u2019s voice revealed a hint of jealousy.Not even he could have guessed that Wen Lingzhao would win Zhu Guqing\u2019s favor so shortly after entering Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, much less become her disciple!Such a lofty status was enough to intimidate even the city lord.Waves of emotion coursed through Huang Qianjun\u2019s heart, and he couldn\u2019t calm down.He finally understood just how weighty the title \u201cGrandmaster\u2019s disciple\u201d really was!\u201d\u2026\u2026The city lord\u2019s estate.When he heard Nie Beihu\u2019s report, the scholarly City Lord Fu Shan couldn\u2019t help but nod.\u201cYou handled this incident well. Wen Changqing and his son knew about Wu Ruoqiu, yet kept it secret. They\u2019ve invited disaster upon their entire family!\u201d Fu Shan laughed coldly.He naturally knew of the depraved organization \u201cthe Deathbringer\u2019s Gate\u201d too.\u201cCity Lord, shall we seize this opportunity to put the Wen Family in its place?\u201d Nie Beihu whispered, his eyes flashing.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right time.\u201d Fu Shan shook his head. \u201cYoung Lord Su already disposed of Wu Ruoqiu, which means we have no witnesses. Besides, a grandmaster\u2019s disciple only just emerged from within their ranks. No matter what, we have to treat them with respect. We can\u2019t be reckless.\u201dHe paused, then asked, \u201cWhat did Young Lord Su have to say about this?\u201dNie Biehu froze. \u201cHe actually didn\u2019t say anything about it.\u201dFu Shan muttered, \u201cWe cannot take this matter into our own hands. Our next step is simply to search the city for Ghoul Worms, that\u2019s all. Remember: once you\u2019ve completed your investigation, you are to report to Young Lord Su.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Nie Beihu nodded in acknowledgment.\u201cRight, there\u2019s something else.\u201d Fu Shan suddenly recalled something. He took out a gold-embossed invitation he\u2019d clearly prepared in advance and passed it to Nie Beihu. \u201cThis is an invitation to the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. Please find the time to deliver it to Young Lord Su.\u201dNie Beihu accepted it, but he couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cSir, given Young Lord Su\u2019s bearing, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll\u00a0disdain\u00a0to participate in such a competition.\u201dFu Shan smiled and shook his head. \u201cWho says I\u2019m requesting his participation? I\u2019ve invited him as a VIP guest. He can spectate and comment on the youths\u2019 martial prowess alongside us.\u201dNie Beihu instantly understood; City Lord Fu Shan was planning to use this as an opportunity to bridge the gap between him and Su Yi!Suddenly, a guard approached and reported, \u201cCity Lord, Family Head\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changjing and Second Elder Wen Changqing have come requesting an audience.\u201d\u201cSee them in,\u201d said Fu Shan offhandedly, then laughed. \u201cCommander Nie, why don\u2019t you guess why they\u2019re here?\u201dNie Beihu laughed too, then answered without hesitation. \u201cThey\u2019re undoubtedly here to absolve themselves of any connection with the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate. After all, if the accusation sticks, disaster might strike at any moment.\u201dFu Shan nodded approvingly. \u201cThat aside, they\u2019ll most likely strongly request our support in bringing Wu Ruoqiu to justice. After all, they can\u2019t let the death of Wen Changqing\u2019s\u00a0son\u00a0go unpunished.\u201dAs expected, when Wen Changjing and Wen Changqing arrived and announced their intentions, it was exactly as Fu Shan expected.Fu Shan had long since made up his mind. He\u2019d restore their reputation and cooperate with them in their efforts to capture Wu Ruoqiu.That night, both the city lord\u2019s Old Guard and the Wen Family guards took action, scouring the city for anything suspicious.This threw the whole city into uproar and attracted an enormous amount of attention.But none of this had anything to do with Su Yi.A night breeze blew past, and the moonlight was as clear as water.Su Yi stood in the courtyard, and after drilling the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique several times, he raised Mortal Edge and began practicing his sword arts.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!His tall, lean figure was suddenly as ethereal as an immortal. His sword moved with him, streaks of sword light scattering like shooting stars, sparks flying when they intercrossed.He was fast as lightning, a fleeting shadow.The tranquil night sky rippled like water, as if the longsword were slicing the very moonlight itself. Beneath its gentle glow, an indistinct shadow appeared and disappeared, like a flickering flame.Fast! Too fast!Illusory swords overlapped, and sword light shifted gracefully. Even Su Yi himself looked fleeting and ethereal, difficult to discern.This was the \u201cRejoicing Sword Sutra.\u201dBy fully taking possession of your heroic spirit, you could breathe out a joyous wind!The essence of this sutra was becoming free and unfettered as the wind, unrestrained and everywhere at once, with no height you could not reach or place you could not go.The Rejoicing Sword Sutra only included six moves.\u201cPulling Galaxies\u201d, \u201cPlucking Suns and Moons\u201d, \u201cSplitting Mountains and Seas\u201d, \u201cSevering Melancholy\u201d, \u201cDemarcating Purity\u201d, and \u201cWandering the Ten Directions.\u201dThe night before, Su Yi had relied on \u201cPulling Galaxies\u201d to slaughter over a hundred Ghoul Worms in one fell swoop.This was one of the ultimate sword styles Su Yi had created in his past life. Its sheer power and the profundity of its Great Dao were enough to place it near the top even among Imperial Realm sword styles!Unfortunately, due to the limits of his cultivation, the current Su Yi could at most practice the sword sutras\u2019 stances and movements. He couldn\u2019t realize its essence or profundities.Without its essence, without the Grand Dao or profound truths, it was at best a sword art of the Martial Dao.In the cultivation world, the secret techniques of the Martial Dao could be divided according to the following basic principle:Arts were inferior to laws, and laws were inferior to the Dao.When it came to \u201cmagic arts\u201d, \u201cmagic\u201d came first and \u201cart\u201d came second.But in \u201cDaoist magic\u201d, the \u201cDao\u201d took precedence over \u201cmagic\u201d.The Four Realms of the Martial Dao represented a gradual shedding of mortality, and the martial arts its experts could use had yet to fully extricate themselves from the mundane. At the end of the day, they were merely \u201carts\u201d or \u201ctechniques.\u201dThe techniques of the Martial Dao were graded according to power. There were four classifications: yellow, profound, earth, and heaven.Yellow grade was at the bottom, while heaven grade was at the top.Each grade was subdivided further into high, mid, and low.Ordinarily speaking, Blood Circulation Realm cultivators could at best practice yellow-grade martial arts.From this, you could infer that Qi Accumulation, Inner Furnace, and An\u0101srava cultivators corresponded to the profound, earth, and heaven grades respectively.Even if you tossed a profound-grade martial art to a Blood Circulation Realm Cultivator, with their cultivation, they\u2019d have a hard time realizing its full power.In short, when it came to martial arts, higher-grade martial arts weren\u2019t always better. They had to suit your current cultivation.Of course, there had always been a handful of monstrous geniuses who broke these rules and broke past the limits of their cultivation to master higher-level techniques.For instance, the Rejoicing Sword Sutra Su Yi was practicing. Although it was merely considered an \u201cart\u201d, if you really tried to appraise it, you\u2019d find it was far beyond ordinary techniques!Seth's ThoughtsThis chapter was a bit of a headache to translate. It should stand on its own, but here\u2019s some cultural background and translation notes for those interested in diving deeper:The four tiers described here correspond to the first lines of the\u00a0\u201cThousand Character Classic\u201d:\u00a0\u5929\u5730\u7384\u9ec4.The Wikipedia article translates it as \u201cHeaven and Earth, Dark and Yellow.\u201d It\u2019s basically comparing and contrasting heaven and earth.The character \u201c\u7384\u201d is translated as \u201cdark\u201d here, but it as multiple meanings. It\u2019s the same character that webnovels usually translate as \u201cprofound\u201d, as well as the \u201cabstruse\u201d in Su Yi\u2019s title and the \u201cXuan\u201d in his courtesy name.I\u2019ve decided to stick with \u201cprofound\u201d here despite the Wikipedia translation, not because I disagree with it, but because \u201cdark\u201d could be interpreted as \u201cevil\u201d or \u201cmalevolent\u201d out of context, and is therefore potentially misleading.Next, let\u2019s take a closer look at this passage:\u201cArts were inferior to laws, and laws were inferior to the Dao.When it came to \u201cmagic arts\u201d, \u201cmagic\u201d came first and \u201cart\u201d came second.Conversely, in \u201cDaoist magic\u201d, the Dao took precedence over \u201cmagic.This was hard to translate due to a difference in how English and Chinese work. I did my best, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to convey the exact meaning in English without additional explanations.Chinese characters are most often parts of words, not words by themselves, and their meaning is context dependant. When picking an English translation, you always have to consider which characters they\u2019re combined with.But Chinese readers are familiar with the characters as individual yet multi-faceted units of meaning. They can have either a clear, context-specific meaning, or a vague, multi-layered and undefined meaning. What I mean is, by itself and without any context, a character can be any one of its possible meanings, or it can be all of them at once.English doesn\u2019t really allow for that. It can be layered/open-ended too, but not in that specific way. To translate, I have to pick just one meaning, but it\u2019s a bit of an unfortunate compromise, but there's nothing for it.This particular passage is differentiating between and ranking three characters: \u672f, \u6cd5\uff0cand \u9053 in order of profundity.\u672f means \u201cart\u201d or \u201ctechnique.\u201d\u6cd5 means \u201cmagic\u201d as in \u201cDaoist magic\u201d or \u201cmagician\u201d, but also \u201cmethod\u201d or \u201claw\u201d depending on context.\u9053 means \u201cthe Dao\u201d, but also \u201cthe path\u201d or the \u201cway\u201d.So basically, techniques and artistry are the most superficial, followed by \u201claws\u201d and \u201cmagics\u201d, which represent a higher level of mastery and understanding.Then, finally, there\u2019s the Dao, which is the deepest and most fundamental of all.The three aforementioned characters can combine to create new words, which the author references in the following lines.\u6cd5\u672f=\u201dmagic\u201d+\u201dart\u201d=\u201dspell\u201d or \u201cmagic art/spell\u201d\u9053\u6cd5=\u201dthe Dao\u201d+\u201dmagic\u201d=Daoist magic.In both cases, the character that represents a higher level of mastery comes first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Sharing Sutras and Transmitting the Dao, the Secrets of Ghost CultivatorsAfter the time it took to brew a pot of tea.Clang!Su Yi\u2019s ethereal figure stopped in place. He stood at the center of the courtyard and sheathed his sword.With one last hum of his sword, the rippling darkness and moonlight regained their former tranquility.\u201cDelightful!\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyes lit up, and he felt intoxicatingly, joyously uninhibited.Why did he call it the Rejoicing Sword?His body was like colored glass, his heart like the sun and moon, radiant yet tranquil. He rejoiced, both body and mind.This was one of the reasons Su Yi was so devoted to the Dao of the Sword.After washing up, Su Yi returned to his room, picked up the ginseng tea he\u2019d brewed in advance, and drained his cup.The liquid instantly washed away his exhaustion.My progress in the Refining Sinew stage is noticeably slower than in the Refining Muscle stage,\u00a0thought Su Yi as he silently took in his body\u2019s subtle changes.\u00a0But now that I\u2019ve taken up residence in the Apricot Clinic, I have no shortage of herbal medicines. So long as I maintain this rate of improvement, I\u2019ll reach full completion of the Refining Sinew stage within a month\u2026..But no matter what, I have to assemble a supply of spiritual medicines before I start Refining Bone. I have no hope of tempering my skeleton to the \u2018marrow like frost\u2019 level by relying solely on ordinary medicinal herbs.Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but sigh.He\u2019d originally planned to take a stroll through the Azurecloud Mountains. The mountains continued for hundreds of miles, vast and sweeping. They undoubtedly included places with concentrated spiritual energy.Spiritual medicines had always arisen in such places!But lately, he\u2019d been busy with his cultivation, and quite a few things had happened, all of which delayed his plans to scour the mountains for medicine.\u201cMystic Master, I\u2019ve decided.\u201d Suddenly, Qing Wan\u2019s timid voice emerged from within the gourd.Su Yi was stunned. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else here at night. You\u2019re welcome to roam as you please; there\u2019s no need to stay in the gourd all the time.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Oh!\u201d Before long, Qing Wan floated up in her red dress, her pretty little face sheepish. She whispered, \u201cMystic Master, without your orders, I dared not leave without permission.\u201d\u201cEnough. You don\u2019t have to be so reserved. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some villain; why are you so on edge?\u201d Su Yi shook his head. He could tell that whenever she saw him, she froze like a startled rabbit, so scared she dared not breathe too loudly. She spoke timidly too.When their gazes met, her eyes were filled with terror and awe.She made it seem like he bullied her on a regular basis\u2026.Despite his words, she still seemed cautious. Su Yi couldn\u2019t be bothered to pursue the matter, so he said, \u201cWhat did you decide?\u201dQing Wan squeezed her fists, as if trying to build up courage, but in the end, she still dared not meet Su Yi\u2019s gaze. \u201cMystic Master, I have no memories of before I died. I don\u2019t want to leave this world without them, so\u2026. So\u2026\u201dSu Yi finished her sentence for her. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve chosen to cultivate and see if you can recover your lost memories?\u201dQing Wan hurriedly nodded. \u201cMmhm!\u201d\u201cRelax,\u201d murmured Su Yi. \u201cEven if you can\u2019t recover them on your own, I\u2019ll help you.\u201dFrom the moment he first laid eyes on Qing Wan, he discovered that although she was only the lowest class of ghost, a mere yin soul, her soul body was unusually pure.Add that to the fact that she\u2019d forgotten her life, and Su Yi realized that there was something unusual about her, which piqued his interest.\u201cThank you, Mystic Master.\u201d Qing Wan\u2019s bright eyes shone with gratitude.Her eyes really were beautiful; big, with depths you could get lost in. The corners of her eyes were slightly slanted; she had a pair of bright \u201cphoenix eyes.\u201dWhen eyes like that smiled, they were shockingly enticing, with an innate charm.Alas, she still looked like a young woman in her teens. She was beautiful and pure, but lacking mature charm.Nevertheless, it was undeniable that she would blossom into the type of monstrous beauty that could topple a nation. She still had lots of room to grow.\u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to teach you the introductory incantation for the \u2018Ten Directions Asura Sutra\u2019. This should be enough to temper your soul body and transform you, step by step, from a yin soul into a phantasm.\u201dAs he said this, he sat before his desk, took out paper and a brush, and began splashing ink across the page.Upon becoming a phantasm, a ghost\u2019s soul body was so concentrated, they no longer needed to fear the sunlight. They could walk through the mortal world in much the same way as everyone else.This was the only way to step properly onto the path of the ghost cultivator.Furthermore, ghost cultivators were different from ordinary cultivators; their soul power was the source of their corporeal bodies. They had no need to temper their flesh, blood, or qi like ordinary martial artists.Thus, upon becoming a phantasm, they could step directly into the Origin Dao.But evolving from a yin soul into a phantasm wasn\u2019t easy. First, she\u2019d need to become a haunt, then a specter. Only then could she become a phantasm.Before long, Su Yi set down his brush and pointed to the freshly-written cultivation technique. \u201cTake a look.\u201dQing Wan carefully drifted over, not daring to get too close to Su Yi. She lowered her head and focused on the text.A moment later, she exhaled and said, \u201cMystic Master, I\u2019ve memorized it.\u201d\u201cThat quickly?\u201d Su Yi ws surprised.She looked at him, her gaze clear and innocent, but she sounded a bit lost. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I committed everything to memory at a glance. One read-through, and I remember every word without any deviations.\u201dSu Yi arched his brow. \u201cYour powers of comprehension are surprisingly good. In that case, I\u2019ll go ahead and explain its profound mysteries. Given your memory, remembering them shouldn\u2019t be difficult.\u201dHe then began by explaining the technique\u2019s name. \u201c\u2018The Ten Directions Asura Sutra\u2019 is the highest Daoist classic the Ghost Emperor of the Western Seas ever wrote, as well as the number one secret scripture in the eyes of the world\u2019s ghost cultivators.\u201dAfter obtaining this sutra in his past life, Su Yi once read through and scrutinized it. In the end, he reached a conclusion\u2014The path of a ghost cultivator was completely different from ordinary soul cultivators.No matter how weak a soul cultivator\u2019s fleshly body might be, they were still living, breathing, human beings. They used their blood, qi, and cultivation to nourish and temper their souls.Ghost cultivators, conversely, walked the \u2018path of the dead.\u2019 As they underwent metamorphosis, their path led them to the Netherworld!Take the Ghost Emperor of the Western Seas. He regularly claimed himself the \u201cenvoy of the Netherworld.\u201dSu Yi was no stranger to the Dao of the Netherworld either. His ability to reincarnate and cultivate anew involved mysterious concepts like \u201cSamsara\u201d and \u201crebirth\u201d; both were part of the Netherworld Dao.It was no exaggeration to say that should Qing Wan cultivate alongside him, even if her success was underwhelming, she\u2019d at least wind up on par with the Ghost Emperor of the Western Seas\u2026Before long, Su Yi explained the cultivation technique\u2019s intricacies in detail. \u201cDo you have any other questions?\u201dQing Wan shut her eyes and thought for a moment, then shook her head. \u201cMystic Master, it seems this cultivation method\u2026. Isn\u2019t really that hard to understand\u2026.\u201dSu Yi took a deep look at her. \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019ll cultivate this sutra. Stay in the Soul-Nourishing Gourd during the day. At night, you can wander freely within the courtyard, but you are not to take so much as a single step beyond its walls without my orders.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Qing Wan meekly acknowledged his command.Facing Su Yi, it was as if she didn\u2019t know what \u201crefusal\u201d and \u201cresistance\u201d were\u2026Su Yi turned away and paid her no further heed. He lay down, and before long, he was fast asleep.Late at night, everything was still.Qing Wan waited for a long time, as if building up courage. Finally, she lifted the hems of her dress and carefully floated outside of the room and sat atop the old locust tree.The red cloth of her dress swayed in the wind. Her feet were unshod, revealing her fair skin and toes that looked like they\u2019d been carved out of white jade. She kicked her legs in the air as she enjoyed the night breeze. Finally, she relaxed completely.Qing Wan looked up through the branches and peered into the starry, moonlit sky, her big eyes shining with delight.Her pink lips parted, and she hummed a melodious, ethereal tune.\u201cA king of old toured the Western Sea and encountered the secluded Elder of Draconic Awe. He went north, entered the spirit caves of the immortal mountain, and pilfered the spiritual talismans of Yu the Great. But the ultimate texts of heaven and earth cannot be revealed lightly. Unless fortune aligns, you cannot force it. Those who try will lose their homeland\u2026\u201dAs she hummed the last portion, she froze. An ineffable grief and sadness coursed through her.\u201cI\u2026. I never learned this tune\u2026. So why can I hum it? Could it be related to my missing memories?\u201d The young woman in the red dress looked silently up at the night sky, a lost look in her eyes.Although she didn\u2019t realize it, Su Yi stood by his window, his hands behind his back, watching the petite figure in red atop the locust tree.A strange light flashed through his eyes. \u201cThe Western Seas, the Elder of Draconic Awe, spirit caves, and the pilfered talismans of Yu the Great? \u2026..What an interesting song.\u201dSeth's ThoughtsThe song Qing Wan sings here is based on the nursery rhyme \u201cSong of the Western Seas.\u201d It's old enough that no children actually sing it anymore, and it\u2019s not particularly well known, but it\u2019s a real ancient song.Qing Wan\u2019s version is very similar to the original, but not the same.

    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - The Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist, Lingering AttachmentsMorning the next day.Outside Guangling City, in the mulberry grove lining the Great Azure.The skies had yet to brighten, but Huang Qianjun was already standing there, waiting.It was only when dawn was just about to break that he saw a familiar figure in the distance. A tall, lean youth was strolling towards him.His clothes were the color of jade, and he looked calm and detached from the mundane world.It was Su Yi!\u201cBrother Su!\u201d Huang Qianjun broke into a smile and rushed to greet him.He carried breakfast in an exquisite pearwood box and a pot of heated, aged wine.\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet, right? This is the bone broth and breakfast our cook prepared, while this is from my father\u2019s wine cellar. It\u2019s a thirty-year vintage.\u201d Huang Qianjun laughed cheerfully.Su Yi was stunned. \u201cSet them aside for now. It won\u2019t be too late to enjoy them after I finish cultivating.\u201dWith that, he walked into the mulberry grove and, ignoring everything else, began practicing the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique.Huang Qianjun waited nearby.He could tell that Su Yi\u2019s technique was extraordinary, but he couldn\u2019t fathom any of its profundities. That\u2019s why he remained calm; his reaction was nothing like the shock Xiao Tianque or Zi Jin had displayed that day.A full two hours passed before Su Yi finished his practice.Huang Qianjun hurriedly opened the boxed meal, took out the soup and breakfast, and arranged them atop a nearby stone. Then he opened the pot of heated wine and started pouring it into cups.Su Yi didn\u2019t stand\u00a0on ceremony. He approached the boulder, took a seat at random, picked up his chopsticks, and started eating.\u201cDo you know why I asked you to meet me here today?\u201d he asked.Huang Qianjun shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but I haven\u2019t figured out why.\u201d\u201cThe curtain opens on the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet in just two weeks. Lately, you\u2019ve followed me and worked at my side, so I naturally can\u2019t let you perform too badly at the banquet.\u201dSu Yi took a sip of wine, closed his eyes, and licked his lips. Inwardly, he couldn\u2019t help but nod.\u00a0This aged flavor really is different.Huang Qianjun was instantly almost incoherent with excitement, and his voice shook. \u201cBrother Su\u2026 Brother Su, are you planning to give me pointers?\u201d\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Su Yi sampled the bone broth. The flavor was incomparably fresh and delicious, and it was obvious that they\u2019d added no small number of precious medicinal herbs. It was extremely beneficial for a martial artist\u2019s cultivation.\u201cThis\u2026. This\u2026.\u201d Huang Qianjun felt as if a treasure had fallen into his lap, and his mind went blank.He\u2019d considered all sorts of possibilities, but it had never occurred to him that Su Yi would help guide his cultivation!\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there like an idiot. Go on and demonstrate the martial art you\u2019re most proficient in.\u201d Su Yi pointed to a nearby clearing.Huang Qianjun hurriedly nodded and rushed off. He took a deep breath, but didn\u2019t move right away. It was only after he calmed himself down that he began.Swoosh!His stance was mighty as he swung his fist, his movements vigorous and grand in scale.This was the ultimate technique of the Huang Family, the \u201cForm-Intention Six Harmonies Fist.\u201dSu Yi ate and drank as he watched, but gradually, he lost his appetite. He didn\u2019t want to drink anymore, either.His eyebrows knit together.By the time Huang Qianjun had run through the entire Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist, Su Yi had his head in his hands, and he felt a headache coming on.\u201cBrother Su, I finished my drill.\u201d Huang Qianjun was covered in sweat, and his spirit trembled with enthusiasm.\u201cYour foundations in the Martial Dao are barely passable, but your attainments in martial arts are lacking. No, they\u2019re a complete mess.\u201d Su Yi sighed. He almost couldn\u2019t bear to watch Huang Qianjun practice. He couldn\u2019t even bring himself to eat.Huang Qianjun\u2019s eyes widened. He looked dazed, uncertain of how to respond. Before long, his face reddened with shame, and he said, \u201cBrother Su, I\u2019ll work hard to improve!\u201dBut inwardly, he felt a bit confused. He was currently in the Refining Muscle stage, and according to his father, his foundations were firm as could be. Furthermore, he already had a definite degree of mastery over the Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist. It was nowhere near as disgraceful as Su Yi made it sound\u2026But Huang Qianjun knew better than to argue.He then watched as Su Yi rose and stood in the very same clearing. \u201cWhat does it mean to \u2018shape the will\u2019? You need both \u2018form\u2019 and \u2018intention!\u2019\u201cThe Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist is harmony of the mind and will, of will and qi, of qi and force, of the shoulders and the hips, of the knees and the elbows, and of the hands and feet. Attacks land instantly, launching at full force even an inch from their target.\u201dAs he spoke, he leaped into action, expounding on the very technique Huang Qianjun had just performed, the Huang Family\u2019s \u201cForm-Intention Six Harmonies Fist.\u201dHe punched, twisted, turned, and lunged, the movements tight and compact, his body like a twisting rope. With each movement, his momentum grew until he was mighty as a mountain, forceful and overpowering.But amidst all this movement, his steps were as steady as a row plow, and when he stood, his feet seemed rooted to the ground!He was firm but not rigid, flexible but not soft. Even as his stance stretched, his movements remained stable and forceful.Huang Qianjun\u2019s pupils constricted, and his heart shook.\u00a0This\u2026.\u201cRemember: the core of this fist technique is the phrase \u2018form and intention as one\u2019. The tangible and intangible coexist, and firmness and softness coincide, striking a balance between movement and tranquility.\u201cEvery time you throw a punch, imagine yourself lifting a divine mallet to hammer a heavenly drum, the sound startling the heavens and shaking the earth, shocking the souls of all who hear it!\u201dFrom a distance, Huang Qianjun saw Su Yi throw a punch as if lifting a mountain or shaking heaven\u2019s gates, or indeed, as if swinging a massive mallet against a celestial drum!That overbearing momentum shook Huang Qianjun to the core. He held his breath, his skin went taut, and his hair stood on end.He was just watching from a distance, but the momentum alone was captivating!\u201cThat\u2026 Is that really our Huang Family\u2019s Form-Intention Six Harmonies\u00a0Fist?\u201d Huang Qianjun was shaken, so much so that he almost bit his tongue. He looked bewildered.Even when his father practiced their fist technique, it was nowhere near as heaven-shaking or tyrannical!A little while later, Su Yi stopped, then stood in place.\u201cDid you understand?\u201d he asked.Huang Qianjun was dazed. Then he said sheepishly, \u201cBrother Su, I\u2026. Understood a little, but I couldn\u2019t understand the essence\u2026..\u201dHis voice trailed off, and he lowered his head.Just now, he\u2019d been immersed in shock. How could he possibly have been calm enough to seriously contemplate the profundities within Su Yi\u2019s movements?This kid is inferior to even a bottom-tier ghost like Qing Wan\u2026.\u00a0Su Yi inwardly shook his head.He pondered for a moment, then broke off a mulberry branch and began writing in the dirt.Shortly after, he tossed it away and said, \u201cThis is a breathing technique I invented on the spot. It\u2019s nothing special, but it's perfectly compatible with your Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist. Remember it, and going forward, use it in your daily cultivation.\u201dHuang Qianjun hurriedly drew closer and began reading seriously.\u201cAlso, meet me here every morning. I\u2019ll give you pointers on your fist technique. But I can only help you for seven days. If you can\u2019t comprehend such simple abstruse truths in a week, there\u2019s no need to follow me any longer.\u201cTake your time and ponder it on your own. I\u2019ll head back on my own.\u201d With that, Su Yi turned to leave.Huang Qianjun stood there, momentarily dazed. Suddenly, he took a deep breath and gnashed his teeth. \u201cBrother Su has just granted me an amazing stroke of fortune. If I can\u2019t seize it, I might as well just slam my head into a wall and die!\u201d\u2026\u2026It\u2019s to be expected. It\u2019s not like everyone in the world is innately clever or monstrously talented, especially in a spiritual barren, mundane place like this. I can\u2019t demand too much from Huang Qianjun\u2026.\u00a0As he made his way back to the Apricot Clinic, Su Yi finally understood. He had the experience of his past life, and he\u2019d seen far too many peerless, monstrous geniuses. Thus, he subconsciously placed excessively high standards on Huang Qianjun.Back at the clinic.When he saw Su Yi, Steward Hu Qian hurried up to him. \u201cSir, Miss Lingxue is visiting with two guests. They\u2019re currently waiting for you at the Apricot Cottage.\u201dThe Apricot Cottage.That was the name of Su Yi\u2019s current residence.\u201cTwo guests?\u201d Su Yi was stunned. He nodded, and stepped through the clinic\u2019s back door.When he pushed open the courtyard gates, he saw three figures standing beneath the locust tree, chatting amongst themselves.One of them was Wen Lingxue.She wore a blue-green dress, which outlined her slender figure, and her lush black hair was tied back in a ponytail, revealing her long neck. Her snowy-white complexion shone faintly beneath the sunlight; she was the picture of a radiant, blooming beauty.He last saw her at the matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet, so they hadn\u2019t seen each other for a week.\u201cBrother-in-law, you\u2019re back!\u201d When she saw Su Yi, Wen Lingxue smiled. Her curly eyelashes and dewy eyes lit up, and her snowy-white hands waved him over.Even her voice was sweet and joyful.A hint of a smile tugged at Su Yi\u2019s lips. Facing such a lively, radiant young woman, how could he\u00a0not\u00a0be happy?But when he saw the man and woman accompanying her, he knit his brow, and the faint smile on his lips faded away.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su.\u201d The woman turned around and looked at Su Yi, her expression complicated.She was sumptuously dressed and beautiful, and she stood with the tranquil poise of an orchid. Her pretty eyes shifted, and she inadvertently revealed a thread of distress and melancholy, making her seem delicate and helpless.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Su Yi was outwardly calm, but inwardly, he was replaying his memories of this unexpected visitor.Nan Ying.Of the disciples of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, she was the only girl who\u2019d ever been close to him. She was quiet and gentle, and\u00a0she\u2019d admired\u00a0him immensely. She\u2019d been his near constant companion.At the time, he\u2019d yet to reawaken the memories of his past life, so he was still gloomy and reclusive, with almost no friends. Nan Ying\u2019s presence had been an enormous comfort to him.They\u2019d accompanied each other day and night for three years.Although they\u2019d never officially become sweethearts, nor had they ever lived together, outsiders saw them as a couple.But the moment he lost his cultivation and was kicked out of Blueriver Sword Manor, Nan Ying disappeared. He hadn\u2019t seen her since, not even once\u2026Even after his marriage into the Wen Family, he\u2019d been depressed over her for a long time, and he\u2019d had a hard time letting her go. He\u2019d felt the urge to seek her out and ask how she could be so heartless on more than one occasion.It was fair to say that his feelings for Nan Ying had been a knot in his heart. Every time he thought of her, his spirits sank and his heart ached.But of course, all of that changed after he reawakened the memories of his past life.Still, he never would have guessed she\u2019d show up here out of the blue.Why had she come?\u201cI\u2026. Senior Apprentice Brother Ni Hao and I are here with Uncle Master Zhou Huaiqiu, undergoing practical training outside the sect. We reached Guangling City yesterday, and I heard a little about you, Senior Apprentice Brother Su, so I wanted to visit you.\u201d Nan Ying bit her pink lips, her expression carrying a hint of grief and pity.\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Su.\u201d A tall, handsome youth in gold robes stood beside Nan Ying. He tilted his head at Su Yi. His expression was reserved, but if you looked closely, his gaze was cold and disdainful.Clearly, he\u2019d greeted Su Yi to be polite, not out of any real respect.Seth's Thoughts\u201cThe Will-Shaping Six Harmonies\u201d seems to the combination of two real martial arts: \u201cSix Harmonies Eight Methods Boxing\u201d\u00a0and the\u00a0\u201cForm-Intention Fist\u201d, also known as the \u201cWill-Shape Fist\u201d or \u201cXingyi Fist.\u201dThe Xingyi Fist includes the\u00a0\u201cone-inch punch\u201d\u00a0popularized by Bruce Lee. A similar move appears in the movie \u201cKill Bill.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - A Viper\u2019s Fangs, a Wasp\u2019s StingNi Hao.He was no stranger to Su Yi either. During his time as the Sword Chief of the Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, Ni Hao was already an influential figure of the inner sect\u2019s East Court.They were acquainted, but they hadn\u2019t interacted much.As for the hint of cold disdain Ni Hao had let slip earlier? Su Yi didn\u2019t mind in the least.\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve seen me. If there\u2019s nothing else, you and Ni Hao can leave,\u201d said Su Yi flatly; he was clearly kicking them out!Nan Ying was surprised. It seemed she dared not believe such impolite words had come out of Su Yi\u2019s mouth.After a moment\u2019s silence, she turned apologetically to Ni Hao. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Ni, can Senior Apprentice Brother Su and I have a quick private chat?\u201d\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t take too long. Uncle Master Zhou is waiting for us at the Li Family estate.\u201d Ni Hao nodded, ignoring Su Yi completely. He turned and left the courtyard.Su Yi furrowed his brow, but in the end, he decided to hear what Nan Ying had to say.\u201cLingxue, go inside and wait for me,\u201d he said softly.Wen Lingxue sensed that the atmosphere was a bit off. She grunted her acknowledgement, then turned and entered Su Yi\u2019s room.Soon, only Su Yi and Nan Ying remained beneath the locust tree.For a moment, Nan Ying stared at him from up close. Then, her lips rose into a faint, playful arc, and she stuck out her jaw. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come, I would never have learned that you\u2019d sunk so low.\u201dShe now seemed like an entirely different person. She was no longer modest, gentle, or elegant. Her beautiful features were contorted with undisguised pride and disdain.\u201cHow glorious was the former Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect? Who would have dared believe that you\u2019d wind up as nothing but a disgraced live-in son-in-law, the butt of Guangling City\u2019s jokes?\u201d Nan Ying giggled. \u201cWell? How does it feel? Awful, right?\u201d\u201cSo, you came here to bear witness to my shame?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up. He couldn\u2019t help but mock himself.\u00a0Three years! How could I have fancied a fickle, untrustworthy woman like her for so long?\u201cThat\u2019s right! I came here to laugh at you!\u201d Nan Ying didn\u2019t even try to deny it. She jeered, \u201cYou were once the outer sect\u2019s Sword Chief. I did everything I could to flatter you and win you over. Every time I saw you, I had to pretend to worship and revere you.\u201cI thought that so long as I stuck with it, you\u2019d smoothly enter the inner sect, and that once you did, you could lend me a hand and get me in too. Who\u2019d have thought that before becoming an inner sect disciple\u2026. You\u2019d lose your cultivation and become nothing but trash?!\u201dHer chest heaved, her pretty face contorted with hatred. \u201cI poured three years of hard work into you, all for nothing!\u201dSu Yi\u2019s furrowed brow gradually relaxed, and he said flatly, \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that when you were by my side, you never had any real feelings for me?\u201d\u201cObviously!\u201d Nan Ying didn\u2019t even hesitate. She was looking forward to seeing the hurt look in his eyes and watching him lose his temper.But she soon discovered that Su Yi was still perfectly calm.His indifferent bearing made her immensely uncomfortable.Finally, she recovered her usual composure and smiled radiantly, \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. After you were reduced to nothing but trash, I found someone else. Senior Apprentice Brother Ni Hao and I are together now.\u201cHe\u2019s a disciple of the Inner Sect\u2019s East Court, an incomparably dazzling figure at Blueriver Sword Manor, the man of the hour. Even before your accident, you wouldn\u2019t even have been worthy of carrying his shoes!\u201cAnd with his help, I entered the inner sect half a year ago. My current position is far beyond a crippled live-in son-in-law like you!\u201dThe more she spoke, the more self-satisfied she seemed; it was obvious that she was deliberately trying to provoke and humiliate Su Yi.But to her surprise, Su Yi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t so much as ripple.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d Nan Ying couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cI just feel a bit sorry for Ni Hao,\u201d said Su Yi casually. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing but a tool to you. You\u2019re sure to kick him right out the door the second you find someone better to cling to.\u201dNan Ying froze, then smiled faintly. \u201cSu Yi, oh, Su Yi. I\u2019m surprised; it seems you\u2019ve gotten much smarter since we last met.\u00a0You\u2019re\u00a0right, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll admit it to anyone now.\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cI can understand that.\u201d\u201cYou understand nothing!\u201d Nan Ying laughed coldly. \u201cI only became an inner sect disciple half a year ago. If you hadn\u2019t wasted three years of my life, I could have done it much faster!\u201dSu Yi sighed to himself.\u00a0Those three years, I sure was blind.This woman isn\u2019t just fickle; she\u2019s nothing but a whore who\u2019d resort to any means necessary to climb higher up the ranks!Su Yi thought about it, then said seriously, \u201cYour methods and shrewdness are still lacking. Someone truly capable wouldn\u2019t reveal their true ugly nature just to vent a bit of resentment. Even the phoniest, most black-hearted hooker has to maintain a beautiful exterior.\u201dIn response, Nan Ying only grinned, baring her teeth. \u201cSo, you finally blew your top and resorted to insults? Let me tell you: in other people\u2019s eyes, I\u2019m gentle, modest, pure, and considerate. Even quite a few members of the sect\u2019s prior generation have developed feelings for me!\u201cEven if a crippled live-in son-in-law like you says I\u2019m a whore, who\u2019ll believe you?\u201d She laughed with incomparable glee.\u201cJunior Apprentice Sister, it\u2019s getting late.\u201d Ni Hao\u2019s voice transmitted from beyond the courtyard.Suddenly, Nan Ying\u2019s smile faded, as did her viciousness, hatred, and resentment. A look of faint concern and vulnerable beauty took their place.Her bearing was modest, and she was stunningly beautiful, graceful and elegant.Su Yi shook his head. Who would have guessed all of this was an act?\u201cSu Yi, you and I already belong to two different worlds. It doesn\u2019t matter how bitter or unwilling you feel; all you can do is lodge under another\u2019s roof like an ant and live on in degradation. In the future, I\u2019ll inevitably soar to prominence, reaching heights you can only look up to but never reach!\u201dNan Ying drew closer, her gaze heartless and indifferent.\u201cRemember,\u201d she whispered, \u201cTell no one about what happened today, or else who knows what I might do?She smiled faintly, then turned to leave. \u201cOf course, even if you do tell people, no one would believe a crippled live-in son-in-law like you!\u201dSu Yi watched her departure. He couldn\u2019t help but rub his nose and laugh.This was for the best; if nothing else, he\u2019d untied one of his mental knots. There was no need to pine over a debased woman like her.It was just like they said: \u201cA viper\u2019s fangs, a wasp\u2019s sting, neither is poisonous as the heart of a whore.\u201d\u201cBrother-in-law.\u201d The door silently opened, and Wen Lingxue walked inside. However, her expression was unsightly, and when she looked at Su Yi, her gaze carried a hint of concern.\u201cYou heard that?\u201d asked Su Yi.\u201cNot clearly, but I heard part of it,\u201d said Wen Lingxue indignantly. \u201cThat woman is simply vile! I\u2019ve never seen anyone so shameless in my life! If I\u2019d known she\u2019d come with ill intentions, I wouldn\u2019t have brought her here.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of people like her out there,\u201d said Su Yi, smiling and tousling Wen Lingxue\u2019s hair. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to concern yourself with her.\u201dSuddenly, he noticed that although it had only been a week since they\u2019d last seen each other, the girl\u2019s aura had undergone a subtle transformation.\u201cDid you start Refining Sinew?\u201d asked Su Yi in surprise.Wen Lingxue immediately flashed him a radiant smile.\u201cIt\u2019s because that technique you taught me is amazing,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cIt\u2019s only been seven days, but it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been reborn.\u201dSu Yi smiled too, then instructed, \u201cWhen cultivating, there is no greater taboo than haste. Remember to stabilize your foundations and temper yourself. You mustn\u2019t be greedy for faster progress.\u201dWen Lingxue nodded firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cRight, are you planning to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet?\u201d asked Su Yi.She shook her head, then lowered it, as if avoiding his gaze. \u201cBrother-in-law, I came here today in part because there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201dSu Yi was stunned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dShe whispered, \u201cTomorrow morning, Uncle Wen Changjing is taking me and my father out of the city. We\u2019re going to Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy to visit my sister. We\u2019ll be gone for at least half a month, and Uncle said\u2026 that you couldn\u2019t come with us\u2026.\u201dShe sounded dejected and helpless.\u201cAre you afraid I\u2019ll be upset? Haha, no need to worry.\u201d Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but laugh and comfort her.It was clear she was concerned about him; there was no other reason she\u2019d be so worried over something so minor.\u201cThen, Brother-in-law\u2026 Do you have anything you\u2019d like to tell my sister? A letter would work too; I can deliver it to her for you,\u201d said Wen Lingxue crisply.Su Yi planned to say \u201cno, I don\u2019t\u201d, but when he saw the young woman\u2019s expectant gaze, his heart softened.He was well aware that she still hoped he and her sister could reconcile and repair their relationship.Alas, although she didn\u2019t know it, he and Wen Lingzhao thought of each other as strangers. There was no rift between them, nor any \u201crelationship\u201d to repair.The reason they were estranged, the reason they couldn\u2019t stand each other, was their marriage itself.The Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family had forcefully intervened from the shadows, and the Wen Family matriarch cooperated, leaving Wen Lingzhao no choice but to marry, unjust as it was.But it wasn\u2019t like he\u00a0wanted to marry into the Wen Family, either!\u201cHow about this? You can deliver a letter\u00a0for\u00a0me.\u201d Su Yi thought about it, then walked into his room and hurriedly scrawled out a line of text.When he returned, he carried a sealed envelope, which he passed to Wen Lingxue.\u201cYou ought to feel more assured now, right?\u201d he said with a smile.Wen Lingxue accepted the envelope and carefully put it away. \u201cMm!\u201dJust as she was about to leave, Su Yi gave her one final instruction. \u201cRemember, you are not to teach your sister the secret art I gave you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brother-in-law. That secret stays between us; there\u2019s no way I\u2019d tell anyone else.\u201d Wen Lingxue waved, then skipped off in delight.Wen Changjing is going to visit Wen Lingzhao at Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy; he probably doesn\u2019t plan to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet at all. It seems that Wen Lingzhao and her status as a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple is more important\u2026.\u00a0Su Yi stood in the courtyard, his arms behind his back.\u00a0But that\u2019s to be expected. A Grandmaster\u2019s disciple is enough to intimidate every major power within Guangling City. So long as the Wen Family holds this \u2018trump card\u2019, they\u2019ll have no need to fear any changes in Guangling City\u2019s situation.He shook his head.He could roughly discern what the woman who was nominally his wife was thinking.She\u2019d undoubtedly resented and opposed this marriage right from the start, which spurred her to grow stronger and stronger, all for the sake of seizing an opportunity to annul their marriage.Did her hatred extend to him or not? Su Yi didn\u2019t know, and he didn\u2019t care.He was actually eager for her to dissolve their marriage; it would save him the trouble of doing it himself.Suddenly, Steward Hu Quan\u2019s voice rang out from beyond the courtyard gates. \u201cSir, there\u2019s a guest here to see you.\u201dSeth's ThoughtsI did a little digging regarding the title and the two lines of poetry in this chapter. I\u2019m seeing multiple sources, but I think the earliest source is the 16th century novel \u201cInvestiture of the Gods.\u201d Don\u2019t take my word for it, though.This is a known (but not necessarily common) phrase. It\u2019s almost the same here as in the original, but not quite. It\u2019s either a modernized version or a deliberate edit on the author\u2019s part, not sure. It could also just be a mistake, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt, shall we?Also, he clearly uses the word \u201cwhore\u201d, while the original just says \u201cwoman.\u201d I suspect that was deliberate.Original: \u9752\u7af9\u86c7\u513f\u53e3\uff0c\u9ec4\u8702\u5c3e\u4e0a\u9488\uff1b\u4e24\u822c\u72b9\u672a\u6bd2\uff0c\u6700\u6bd2\u5987\u4eba\u5fc3Novel: \u9752\u86c7\u7af9\u513f\u53e3\uff0c\u9ec4\u8702\u5c3e\u540e\u9488\u3002\u00a0\u4e24\u8005\u7686\u4e0d\u6bd2\uff0c\u6700\u6bd2\u5a4a\u5fc3\u6df1\u3002A more literal translation of the original would be \u201cThe mouth of a green bamboo snake, the needle at the end of a wasp\u2019s tail, it\u2019s as if neither is poisonous, a woman\u2019s heart is the most poisonous of all.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - Both the Hero and the Beauty are Still YoungThis new visitor was the son of Nie Beihu, Nie Teng.Su Yi had encountered this valiant youth once before, at the Immortal Gathering House.Although he still had a few youthful vices, he was hotblooded and understood gratitude.That part of him, at least, had already won Su Yi\u2019s approval.\u201cBrother Su, my father told me to deliver you this invitation.\u201d As Nie Teng entered the courtyard, he greeted him solemnly, then proffered the gold-embossed card with both hands. \u201cCity Lord Fu Shan prepared this just for you. He hopes that you can join us at the next Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet as a VIP guest.\u201dDespite himself, Su Yi was surprised. He mulled it over, then accepted the card. \u201cI\u2019ll accept this for now. As for whether I choose to attend, it\u2019ll come down to whether or not I have time to spare.\u201dNie Teng exhaled, then said, \u201cBrother Su, there\u2019s one other thing. Last night, the city lord\u2019s estate joined forces with the Wen Family to search for clues regarding Ghoul Worms. We\u2019ve already located two \u2018worm farms\u2019. Both have since been destroyed.\u201dHe paused, then continued, \u201cWe should be able to search all suspicious locations within the city within three days. Father told me to tell you that there\u2019s no need for you to concern yourself too much with this, and that if there are any developments, he\u2019ll have me inform you.\u201dSu Yi examined the courteous, restrained youth before him in mild surprise. Suddenly, he laughed. \u201cYour father has really thought this through. Alright, that\u2019s everything. Hurry back and report to your father.\u201dBut Nie Teng hesitated, as if struggling to put something into words.Finally, he steeled himself and said in a low voice, \u201cBrother Su, my father also told me to follow you and learn from you. We hope that you\u2026 We hope that you won\u2019t carry a grudge over my rudeness when we first met at the Immortal Gathering House.\u201dAs he reached the end, he sounded sheepish and awkward.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a parent\u2019s concern for his child,\u201d lamented Su Yi.But when he recalled his father in his current lifetime, Su Hongli, he felt nothing but unforgettable hatred and indignation.This obsession runs too deep; it\u2019s already planted roots in my heart. I\u2019ll have to resolve this sooner or later, or my lingering regrets will make my heart unstable.\u00a0Su Yi shook his head, cast his scattered thoughts aside, and asked offhandedly, \u201cAnd how do you feel about your father\u2019s arrangements?\u201dNie Beihu\u00a0really had helped\u00a0him with quite\u00a0a lot. Although Nie Beihu had taken all of it upon himself, Su Yi couldn\u2019t refuse his good intentions.Furthermore, without Nei Beihu\u2019s assistance last night, he couldn\u2019t possibly have smoothed Wen Jieyuan\u2019s death over so easily.As such, Su Yi was actually willing to at least consider whether or not Nie Teng was worthy of looking after.\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Nie Teng fell silent, suddenly inwardly conflicted.After a while, he grit his teeth and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to follow my father\u2019s arrangements. I\u2019m still young, and I don\u2019t want to borrow another\u2019s power to cultivate. Even if the obstacles in my path leave me broken and bruised, I want to venture forth on my own!\u201dHis words were forceful and decisive.Finally, he took a deep breath, and his eyes shone with longing and determination. \u201cEven if my hard work amounts to nothing, so long as I follow my heart, I\u2019ll have no regrets.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s eyes glinted with a hint of admiration.Youths ought to have such lofty ambitions!The older generation might turn up their noses at such things, but they\u2019d long since lost their youthful, hotblooded vigor and wholehearted determination.\u201cBoth the hero and beauty are still young. Of the countless valiant figures of history, who wasn\u2019t once an outstanding youth?\u201d Su Yi sighed, and his thoughts were elsewhere.When he saw Nie Teng\u2019s spirited youthfulness, he recalled his own youth in his past life. He was open and upright, clad in blue, sword in hand as he traversed all corners of the world on horseback. Stopping by a leaning bridge, buildings full of red-sleeved beauties beckoned to him. He\u2019d drunk his fill of the world\u2019s pleasures!Nie Teng was stunned, and a little confused.Su Yi is obviously the same age as me, give or take. Why does he sound so much like an elder reminiscing about his bygone youth?\u201cGo back and tell your father that I admire your decision, and that within ten years, so long as I remain within the Great Zhou\u2019s borders, you are free to come to me with any problems you cannot resolve on your own. I\u2019ll assist you up to three times.\u201dWith that, Su Yi put his hands behind his back, turned, and walked back into his room.He muttered to himself, \u201cThere\u2019s no seniority or rank between sparrows and swans. I might wear cotton and drink like a commoner, but a sovereign is like a great peng soaring amidst the clouds. He hates nothing more than heavens too low for him to fly in.\u201cNow, I too am a youth. As the old poem goes, I ought to have the spirit needed to \u2018use the heavens as my shore upon reaching the limits of the ocean\u2019, and \u2018become a new peak upon reaching the top of a mountain\u2019!\u201dNie Teng stood there, dazed, as Su Yi disappeared into his room. When he finally came to his senses, he waved, then turned and dashed off excitedly.He could finally answer to his father.\u2026.Guangling City, the Li Family.In the hall they used for welcoming guests.\u201cBrother Zhou, with you in attendance at this year\u2019s Dragon Gate Banquet, we\u2019re sure to attract countless eyes. After all, your status is lofty enough that even City Lord Fu Shan has to treat you with respect,\u201d said Family Head Li Tianhan with a respectful smile.Zhou Huaiqiu sat on another side of the room. He waved and said flatly, \u201cI just happened to be passing through and thought I\u2019d take this opportunity to see the prowess of Guangling and Cloudfall Cities\u2019 youths for myself. I\u2019ll leave managing the banquet up to City Lord Fu.\u201dHis hair and whiskers were graying, and his robes were simple cloth. He looked a bit aged, but when his eyes opened and closed, they glinted with intimidating sharpness.\u201cHahaha, Brother Zhou, you\u2019re too modest! You\u2019re an elder of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s inner sect, and you\u2019ve attained perfection in the \u2018Thirteen Stances of the Bluepeak Sword.\u2019 Your name is enough to shake all of Cloudriver Prefecture!\u201dLi Tianhan laughed heartily. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re still in your prime! You\u2019re certain to have an opportunity to point your blade at the Grandmaster Realm and achieve even higher breakthroughs!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t just empty flattery.Of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s twelve elders, Zhou Huaiqiu was ranked fourth, and his attainments in the Dao of the Sword were exquisite and deep. In Cloudriver Prefecture, they honored him as the \u201cBluepeak Sword Elder.\u201d\u201cThe Grandmaster Realm\u2026.\u201d Zhou Huaiqiu\u2019s gaze went a little misty, and he sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard level to reach, harder than reaching the blue skies. I\u2019ve been stuck at the peak of the Qi Accumulation Realm for nineteen years now, yet I\u2019ve at most barely reached the threshold of the Grandmaster Realm. Who knows how many years of bitter struggle I\u2019ll need to step through that doorway\u2026.?\u201dAs he spoke, the handsome, golden-robed Ni Hao and the gentle, modest beauty in white, Nan Ying,\u00a0walked in side\u00a0by side.\u201cYou visited Su Yi, right? How is he doing?\u201d asked Zhou Huaiqiu.\u201cWe saw him, Uncle Master,\u201d said Nan Ying with a meek, courteous bow. She sighed dejectedly, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su has lost his cultivation and married into the Wen Family; his predicament really makes one\u2019s heart ache.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Zhou Huaiqiu, his expression complicated and his gaze upset. \u201cSu Yi, that boy, had an incredible knack for the Dao of the Sword. When he became the outer sect\u2019s sword Chief, I was certain that his accomplishments would be no inferior to your Senior Apprentice Brother Ni\u00a0Hao\u2019s.He sighed, \u201cBut the heavens envy the talented! Just like that, his Martial Dao ended prematurely!\u201dHow could a waste like him compare with Senior Apprentice Brother Ni Hao?\u00a0Nan Ying muttered to herself, but out loud, she hurriedly comforted Zhou Huaiqiu. \u201cUncle Master, all of that is in the past. You needn\u2019t worry about Senior Apprentice Brother Su; he might have become an ordinary person, but his life is pretty decent.\u201dZhou Huaiqiu nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go visit him; I was afraid I\u2019d bring back painful memories and make him brood over his lost cultivation.\u201dSuddenly, Ni Hao turned to Li Tianhan. \u201cUncle Li, is Junior Apprentice Brother Moyun home?\u201dLi Tianhan\u2019s eyes glinted, and he laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s truly a bit unfortunate, but he left just yesterday. He\u2019s already on his way back to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital.\u201dNi Hao nodded. \u201cThat makes sense. With his status and cultivation, there\u2019s no need for him to spar in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.When they brought up Li Moyun, Zhou Huaiqiu couldn\u2019t help but smile and praise him. \u201cMoyun, that kid, really is something. His talent for the Martial Dao is outstanding. If you ask me, he\u2019ll be able to try breaking into the Qi Accumulation Realm within the year.\u201d\u201cHahaha, Brother Zhou, you\u2019re exaggerating!\u201d Li Tianhan laughed in delight.\u201cUncle Master, Apprentice Brother Ni Hao is no slouch either, yet you rarely praise him. You\u2019re too biased!\u201d Nan Ying interjected in a coquettish attempt to defend Ni Hao\u2019s honor.Seeing this, Zhou Huaiqiu couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.\u201cNi Hao is indeed a dragon among men, a rare genius among youths. There\u2019s no need to even question it!\u201d Li Tianhan continued, \u201cBut the way I see it, Su Yi\u2019s predicament is likely to get worse.\u201dZhou Huaiqiu furrowed his brow. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201dLi Tianhan\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cTo my knowledge, his wife, Wen Lingzhao, is about to become Grandmaster Zhu Guqing\u2019s direct disciple, and she\u2019s a stunning beauty with numerous admirers within Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. Several sons of noble families have already announced that they plan to oust Su Yi from her side completely.He paused, then sighed with emotion. \u201cGiven his situation, the days ahead can\u2019t possibly be easy for Su Yi. You ask me, and never mind the others; the Wen Family themselves are likely to think less and less of him. It\u2019s entirely possible that something unfortunate will befall him.\u201dZhou Huaiqiu\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he sank into silence. He felt sorry for Su Yi and his impending misfortunate, but his hands were tied.Despite a bit of a guilty conscience, Zhou Huaiqiu didn\u2019t feel strongly enough to stand against a grandmaster\u2019s disciple, and there was certainly no way he\u2019d get mixed up in the Wen Family\u2019s affairs.For one thing, it sounded like trouble. For another, overextending his reach might very well invite disaster onto him instead.\u201cHe can\u2019t blame anyone else for this. If he wants to blame someone, he should blame himself; he\u2019s in no way worthy of a woman like Wen Lingzhao,\u201d said Ni Hao flatly.\u201cLet\u2019s not discuss this any further,\u201d said Zhou Huaiqiu with a wave, looking a bit upset.Li Tianhan smiled, but inside, he thought to himself,\u00a0It seems everyone has made the same prediction. They\u2019ve realized that after Wen Lingzhao becomes a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple, that cripple Su Yi is effectively done for.That\u2019s enough!Now I just have to wait and see when Moyun makes his move!Starting that day, Zhou Huaiqiu, Ni Hao, and Nan Ying took up residence in the Li Family estate. They planned to stay there until after the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.Morning the next day.Family Head Wen Changjing, Wen Changtai, Qin Qing, and\u00a0Wen\u00a0Lingxue left Guangling City to visit Wen Lingzhao.From beginning to end, only Wen Lingxue bothered so much as mentioning this to Su Yi. The others ignored Wen Lingzhao\u2019s supposed husband completely.Su Yi naturally didn\u2019t mind.He strolled along the river, his tall frame bathed in gentle sunlight. As he neared the mulberry grove, he noticed that this time, there were two people waiting for him.Seth's Thoughts\u2018Both the hero and beauty are still young. Of the countless valiant figures of history, who wasn\u2019t once an outstanding youth?\u2019The title and Su Yi\u2019s musings come from the song \u201c\u6c38\u5b9a\u56db\u5341\u5e74\u201d. I\u2019m not familiar with it, and out of context, it\u2019s not immediately obvious whether \u201c\u6c38\u5b9a\u201d, \u201cYongding\u201d, is a place name or whether it means \u201ceternal stability/permanent residence.\u201d There is a place called Yongding in the Fujian provice, but \u201cyongding\u201d makes sense as a noun or adjective too.So the song\u2019s name is either \u201cForty years in Yongding\u201d or \u201cForty years of stability.\u201d I\u2019d guess the former, but I don\u2019t care enough to do any further research, but if you\u2019re interested, you can listen to the song\u00a0here.2) \u201cThere\u2019s no seniority or rank between sparrows and swans. I might wear cotton and drink like a commoner, but a sovereign is like a great peng soaring amidst the clouds. He hates nothing more than heavens too low for him to fly in.\u201dThis is another modified quote.Original: \u71d5\u96c0\u9e3f\u9e44\u65e0\u5c0a\u5351\uff0c\u5e03\u8863\u738b\u4faf\u9152\u4e00\u676f\u3002\u6211\u672c\u4e91\u4e2d\u5927\u9e4f\u9e1f\uff0c\u53ea\u770b\u5929\u4f4e\u4e0d\u80af\u98deModified: \u71d5\u96c0\u9e3f\u9e44\u65e0\u5c0a\u5351\uff0c\u5e03\u8863\u738b\u4faf\u9152\u4e00\u676f\uff0c\u541b\u662f\u4e91\u4e2d\u5927\u9e4f\u9e1f\uff0c\u53ea\u6068\u5929\u4f4e\u4e0d\u80af\u98deThe main difference is that Su Yi indirectly refers to himself as a \u201csovereign\u201d, while the original is more like \u201cI\u2019ve always been (like) a great peng.\u201d Furthermore, Su Yi says that he \u201chates\u201d not having enough space to spread his wings, while the original says he \u201csees\u201d that the heavens aren\u2019t high enough for him.The difference is subtle, but Su Yi\u2019s version comes across as more arrogant.The source of this quote seems to be the webnovel \u201cYang God\u201d by the author Meng Ru Shen Ji, AKA \u201cDivine Dreamwalker.\u201d\u00a0It looks like there are about twenty chapters of it in translation, but it\u2019s since been dropped.\u00a0It\u2019s possible that the quote referenced here is in turn taken from an older text, but that\u2019s as far as my digging took me.3) \u201c(I) use the heavens as my shore upon reaching the limits of the ocean and become a new peak upon reaching the top of a mountain\u201d is a somewhat liberal translation of a line from Qing Dynasty poet Lin Zexu\u2019s poem \u201cChulao.\u201d Not sure about the original, but coming from Su Yi, it\u2019s basically a metaphor for forging ahead even upon reaching an apparent \u201climit\u201d and striving for ever greater heights.4) \u201cHe was open and upright, clad in blue, sword in hand as he traversed all corners of the world on horseback. Stopping by a leaning bridge, buildings full of red-sleeved beauties beckoned to him.\u201dThis is another modified poem excerpt. It\u2019s based on the poem \u201c\u83e9\u8428\u86ee\u201d or \u201cPu Sa Man\u201d by Tang Dynasty poet Wei Zhuang. The author added and subtracted a few details to make it describe Su Yi.You can see alternative English translations (of the original, not the novel\u2019s version)\u00a0here\u00a0and another\u00a0here.\u00a0The lines in question are near the middle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - The Huang Family\u2019s Offering, the Four Realms of the Martial DaoThey were Huang Yunchong and Huang Qianjun, father and son.After a brief daze, Su Yi understood.Indeed, Huang Yunchong hurried over, his expression grateful. \u201cYoung Lord Su, yesterday I learned that you taught my son a profound and mysterious secret art. I\u2019m shocked and flattered, so I came here to express my gratitude in person!\u201d As he spoke, he bowed solemnly at the waist.Su Yi calmly accepted this show of respect.The breathing technique he\u2019d created on the spot yesterday wasn\u2019t all that lofty or profound, but to the Huang Family, which practiced the Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist, it was an enormous stroke of good fortune!Huang Yunchong was clearly well aware of what it represented to the Huang Family. It would have been stranger if he hadn\u2019t come to express his thanks.\u201cIt was nothing, as easy as lifting my hand. If there\u2019s nothing else, please be on your way.\u201dAs he spoke, Su Yi walked into the mulberry grove and began practicing the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique.His attitude was a bit cold and indifferent, but Huang Yunchong didn\u2019t mind at all.After hearing his son recount the breathing technique Su Yi taught him, he completely lost his calm. He couldn\u2019t have been any more grateful.When he finally calmed down, he reached a single conclusion\u2014With this breathing technique, the Huang Family would rise to new heights. They\u2019d reach a whole new level!This was something Huang Yunchong wouldn\u2019t have even dared dream about in the past.The Dao couldn\u2019t be taught lightly, and laws weren\u2019t to be passed on casually.In the Great Zhou, a single powerful breathing technique was enough to change the destiny of an entire clan!\u201cChild, remember what I told you yesterday. You have to work hard. Don\u2019t disappoint Young Lord Su after all he\u2019s done to train you up.\u201d Huang Yunchong took a deep breath and patted Huang Qianjun on the shoulder.Then, he turned to the distant Su Yi, who was busy drilling his martial arts, and clasped his fist. Finally, he turned and left in silence.\u201cWhat he told me yesterday\u2026.?\u201d Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but recall the solemn words his father had spoken before their ancestors\u2019 memorial tablets:\u201cChild, you\u2019re still young, and you don\u2019t understand the significance of this secret art. Let me tell you directly that this technique alone is so weighty, every generation of the Huang Family will remember this benevolence!\u201dThis was Huang Qianjun\u2019s first time seeing his father so solemn.It was also his first team realizing that, simply by following Su Yi and acting as his subordinate, he\u2019d inadvertently given his entire clan a chance to change their destinies!\u201cIs this what they mean when they \u2018when one person obtains the Dao, even their dogs and chickens ascend into the heavens?\u2019\u201d Huang Qianjun glanced at Su Yi, who was practicing martial arts not far away. An unprecedented reverence welled within his heart.\u00a0Brother Su really is amazing!After finishing his daily cultivation, Su Yi walked over and saw the piping-hot breakfast and drinks Huang Qianjun had ready for him.\u201cEe? Are there spiritual medicines in today\u2019s bone broth?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s nostrils flared. He smelled something different in the soup.\u201cBrother Su, my father said that for the next week our steward will prepare a spiritual medicine for you once a day.\u201d With that, Huang Qianjun pulled out an embroidered pouch and passed it over. \u201cThis contains fifty spirit stones. They\u2019re a token of the Huang Family\u2019s gratitude, and we hope you\u2019ll accept them. If you refuse, my father won\u2019t let me through the door\u2026.\u201dA stalk of spiritual medicine a day. Seven days meant seven stalks in total.Add that to fifty spirit stones\u2026 The Huang Family had really spared no expense!Su Yi was stunned despite himself.There was no need to even discuss how rare and precious spiritual medicines were.Spirit stones were even rarer. There were none to be found in the markets; money alone wasn\u2019t enough to purchase them.To the best of Su Yi\u2019s knowledge, the Three Great Clans of Guangling City had less than a hundred spirit stones apiece.Yet now, the Huang Family had offered fifty such spirit stones at once!Huang Yunchong is actually quite clever. He knows that the value of a good breathing technique far exceeds mere treasures like these.\u00a0Su Yi shook his head, then set those thoughts aside and began eating and drinking.Huang Qianjun, meanwhile, entered the nearby clearing and began practicing the Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist.When he finished his practice, Su Yi pointed out a few imperfections, then left.The Apricot Cottage.\u201cWith these spirit stones, I can temporarily set aside my plans to pick medicine in the Azurecloud Mountains.\u201d Su Yi poured the embroidered pouch\u2019s contents onto his desk. The spirit stones glittered, clear and transparent, emanating spiritual undulations.Although all of them were just tier-one spirit stones, the lowest class, they were already hard to find in the spiritually-barren Great Zhou.\u201cNot bad. With these spirit stones, I can reach the peak of the Refining Sinew Stage within two weeks!\u201d Su Yi\u2019s lips curved upward in a hint of a smile.One day passed, then another.Su Yi\u2019s life was calm but fulfilling. Nothing happened to stir up any waves.When he wasn\u2019t cultivating, he would occasionally see patients, audit the ledgers, and collect profits.And at night, when all was still, he\u2019d call upon the beautiful but ditzy ghost Qing Wan and instruct her in her cultivation.When the mood struck, he\u2019d chat with her.Unfortunately, she still couldn\u2019t overcome her timidness. When she faced him, she was still as fearful as could be.This left Su Yi at a loss. If she was scared to even talk to him, who knew how terrified she\u2019d be if he touched her?If things went on like this, how were they supposed to engage in dual cultivation? Dual cultivation was no joke, and required doing all sorts of things. There was no avoiding direct contact, both body and soul.If anything went wrong, it would be a disaster.But of course, dual cultivation was still far away. The way Su Yi saw it, he\u2019d have plenty of time to teach Qing Wan not to be so afraid of him.At night, when no one else was around, Qing Wan sometimes sat in the locust tree and hummed ancient tunes. Her voice was beautiful and ethereal.It was true; Qing Wan really was a multi-talented lady ghost.During this period, Nie Teng visited twice to report on various matters.For example, the guards had scoured the entirety of Guangling City. They\u2019d discovered seven Ghoul Worm farms in total, but all seven had been disposed of, preventing future trouble.Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but wonder; if Wu Ruoqiu was really raising the worms on his sect\u2019s orders, why hadn\u2019t they sent anyone to investigate after all their worm farms were destroyed?In the end, Su Yi inferred two possibilities.One, the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate already understood that something had happened to Wu Ruoqiu and they were currently investigating in secret.Two, the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate still didn\u2019t know what had happened, so they\u2019d yet to react.Regardless of which possibility turned out to be correct, Su Yi knew that the heretical cultivators of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate wouldn\u2019t just let this go.But of course, this latent danger was nothing to Su Yi himself.They were a third-rate sect, a bunch of losers who used virgins\u2019 menstrual blood to refine their weapons. What could a group like that possibly achieve?As time went on, the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet drew closer and closer.Boats clustered along the Great Azure, their faint outlines visible even from far away. Artisans from both sides of the river seized every moment to finish setting up the banquet\u2019s venue.Furthermore, the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet had become the talk of the town on both sides of the river.Even the ordinary civilians were incomparably excited.This was because the banquet was held at night, and countless lanterns would light up the Great Azure, like a galaxy of flame descending to earth. The glowing lights were like a painting against the inky darkness of the night; it was a top-class spectacle.\u2026It was morning in the mulberry grove outside of Guangling City.\u201cBrother Su, I\u2019ve begun Refining Sinew!\u201d Huang Qianjun was enormously excited, like a student waiting for his teacher to praise him.But Su Yi merely nodded and said flatly, \u201cWith my guidance and the medicine the Huang Family is supplying you, if you couldn\u2019t reach this step, there\u2019d be no point in cultivating any further.Huang Qianjun instantly deflated, and his excitement faded.Su Yi thought for a moment, then added, \u201cBut with your current attainments in martial arts, you\u2019ve just barely stepped over the threshold. When the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet comes, you still might not be Wen Jueyuan\u2019s opponent, but even if you lose, you won\u2019t embarrass yourself.\u201dLearning martial arts was a long-term process, starting from the superficial and becoming deeper with practice.Attainments in any martial art could be divided into four stages: \u201cpeering through the door\u201d, \u201cstepping over the threshold\u201d, \u201cproficiency\u201d, and \u201cmastery.\u201d\u201cPeering through the door\u201d referred to successfully performing all of a technique\u2019s stances and attacks.For ordinary martial artists, reaching this stage wasn\u2019t particularly difficult.\u201cStepping over the threshold\u201d\u00a0referred\u00a0to understanding the essence of your technique. At this level, there was a nuance and power to every stance and movement.Proficiency took that a step further. It meant full understanding of a martial art, that you could call upon it at will, without conscious effort. Every time you attacked, you could realize a martial art\u2019s highest level of power.As for mastery, that meant practicing a martial art to the level of comprehending other techniques by analogy, of seeing one stance and inferring three others. It meant merging your own understanding and experiences into your martial art, allowing you to explode with unprecedented power.When you practiced a martial art to the level of \u201cmastery\u201d, you\u2019d obtain a \u201cforce\u201d unique to oneself.Like sword, knife, or fist force.But ordinary yellow-grade martial arts contained little profundity.Never mind reaching \u201cmastery\u201d; just achieving proficiency was enormously difficult.Take the Huang Family\u2019s original Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist. Its potential stopped at mere \u201cproficiency.\u201dBut with Su Yi\u2019s guidance and assistance, combined with the breathing technique he\u2019d made, their fist technique had undergone a qualitative metamorphosis.So long as Huang Qianjun kept practicing, he\u2019d reach mastery eventually!\u201cBrother Su, the curtains open on the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet in just three days. Are you planning to come?\u201d Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cIt depends how I feel at the time,\u201d said Su Yi casually.He\u2019d lost track of how many heaven-shaking \u201cdiscussions of the Dao\u201d he\u2019d participated in. Anyone eligible to join in was a glorious, mighty figure famed throughout the world.He really couldn\u2019t work up any interest in participating in a minor event like the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.Huang Qianjun was a bit disappointed.\u00a0If Brother Su participates, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll easily take the number-one spot!Just thinking about it filled his heart with excitement.Huang Qianjun suddenly seemed to remember something. \u201cBrother Su, I heard that one of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s inner sect elders, Zhou Huaiqiu, will be in attendance. If anyone who puts on a spectacular performance will receive direct admission to the Blueriver Sword Manor!\u201dHis gaze filled with longing. \u201cSo, I hope I can put on a good\u00a0showing. Even if I can\u2019t take the number one spot, if Senior Zhou Huaiqiu takes a liking to me, I can ascend the heavens in a single bound!\u201d\u201cZhou Huaiqiu\u2026.\u201d When he heard this familiar name, Su Yi was briefly stunned. Memories of his past flooded into his mind.Some time later, he glanced at Huang Qianyun, shook his head, and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the extent of your ambition? What a disappointment!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Fu Shan\u2019s RequestThe Apricot Cottage.When Su Yi returned from beyond city limits, he saw someone entirely unexpected waiting for him.City Lord Fu Shan!\u201cMaster Su.\u201d Fu Shan smiled and stepped forward to greet him. \u201cI came uninvited. I hope you won\u2019t take offense.\u201dThis time, he addressed Su Yi as \u201cMaster\u201d, just like Xiao Tianque and Zi Jin.This was a show of respect, as well as an indication that Fu Shan no longer saw Su Yi as a mere youth.Su Yi said thoughtfully, \u201cCity Lord Fu, have you encountered a problem you can\u2019t resolve on your own?\u201d\u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t hide it from you.\u201d Fu Shan sighed, a hint of worry on his brow. \u201cI\u2019m here with a presumptuous request, and I hope you can assist me.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d Su Yi nodded.Fu Shan paused to organize his thoughts, then said, \u201cThe Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet starts in three days. At first, everything was well under control, but yesterday, I received a letter from the Cloudfall City Lord, Li Jianyu.\u201cIn it, he suggested that we use this year\u2019s Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet to settle our dispute over Spiritbamboo Island\u2019s ownership.\u201cIf a youth of Guangling City takes the martial arts championship, the island will enter our jurisdiction. The city lord\u2019s estate will take control of it for a period of ten years.\u201cBut if the championship goes to Cloudfall City, the island will fall under their domain.\u201dSu Yi was starting to understand. \u201cIs there something special about this Spiritbamboo Island?\u201d\u201cIndeed there is.\u201d Fu Shan explained, \u201cThe island is thirty miles away from Guangling City along the Great Azure. It's an island in the middle of the river.\u201cIt\u2019s only about three hundred feet across, but it\u2019s a blessed land of concentrated spiritual energy. It includes a thirty-foot bamboo grove. The bamboo is a special variety called \u2018Bluejade Spirit Bamboo.\u2019\u201cThe bamboo is like lustrous jade, bright and flourishing. Every inch of it is a treasure. The roots, shoots, and leaves are all like spiritual medicines, brimming with ample wood element spiritual energy.\u201cAnd the mature\u00a0bamboo is a precious spiritual material. If you use it to make weapons, the results are extraordinary, like divine artifacts.In the past, Guangling City and Cloudfall City took turns controlling Spiritbamboo Island. The island would change hands every three years.\u201cBut ever since Li Jianyu became the Cloudfall City Lord two years ago, he\u2019s seemed intent on ripping up our former agreement. He no longer acknowledges our earlier rules, and he intends to bring Spiritbamboo Island entirely under his control.\u201cOver the past two years, we\u2019ve clashed over Spiritbamboo Island on numerous occasions, and our conflict has only worsened over time. If we don\u2019t resolve it soon, I\u2019m afraid a violent struggle is sure to follow.\u201d When he said this, Fu Shan laughed bitterly.Su Yi said, \u201cIt sounds like he\u2019s suggesting resolving this matter at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. Isn\u2019t that exactly what you wanted?\u201dFu Shan sighed. \u201cHad I known about his suggestion earlier, I would have been happy to agree to his terms, but he only informed me last night. That makes this difficult.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up.\u201cAll young martial artists aged eighteen and under are eligible to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. Had I known about this earlier, I would have prepared and arranged for some capable young talents to participate.\u201d Fu Shan patiently explained, \u201cBut time is short; I don\u2019t have time to make such arrangements. By comparison,\u00a0that Li\u00a0Jianyu suggested this implies that he\u2019s long since prepared for it and is fully confident.\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cThat Li\u00a0Jianyu is quite crafty.\u201dFu Shan said coldly, \u201cThat old fox is ruthless and crafty. He\u2019s never fought any battle he isn\u2019t certain he can win, and this time is no exception. I\u2019ve already investigated, and it seems he\u2019s long since arranged for a young genius called \u2018Mo Tianling\u2019 to take part in the competition.\u201cMo Tianling hails from Cloudfall City\u2019s Mo Family. He\u2019s eighteen, and he\u2019s at the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm. He spent two years cultivating at Blueriver Sword Manor.\u201cAfterward, he left Cloudriver Prefecture and joined the Cloudlight Marquis\u2019 Redscale Army. He\u2019s spent over a year engaged in slaughter on the battlefield, and he\u2019s grown long accustomed to life-and-death battles. He\u2019s accumulated numerous merits, too.\u201cA ruthless, experienced fighter like him isn\u2019t someone our academy students, kids who\u2019ve never seen bloodshed, can handle.\u201d Fu Shan sounded fraught with concern, and his brow was tightly knit.\u201cSo it\u2019s him!\u201d The name felt a little familiar, and Su Yi quickly recalled where he\u2019d heard it.During his three years cultivating in Blueriver Sword Manor, Mo Tianling was already an inner sect disciple.He was cold and harsh, his temper violent and unpredictable. He\u2019d once brutally severed a\u00a0sectmate\u2019s\u00a0right arm in a duel, angering the sect\u2019s higher-ups. In the end, they kicked him out.Su Yi wouldn\u2019t have guessed he\u2019d hear his name again now, years later.\u201cMaster Su, I know that it\u2019s unreasonable to ask someone of your status to participate in such a contest, but I really don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d said Fu Shan. Su Yi\u2019s silence was starting to make him nervous, and his heart pounded in his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you choose to abstain; I can try and think of an alternative solution.\u201dAt first, he hadn\u2019t even considered asking Su Yi for help.It was only after Nie Beihu reminded him that he suddenly recalled that Master Su, whose brilliance even the Spiritjade Marchioness respected, was only seventeen years old!At his age, he was naturally qualified to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.Thus, after hesitating for quite some time, Fu Shan made up his mind, thickened his skin, and requested Su Yi\u2019s aid.Of course, he didn\u2019t expect someone of Su Yi\u2019s status to agree lightly. He was here because he thought it couldn\u2019t hurt to ask.Su Yi suddenly asked, \u201cI heard that Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s Zhou Huaiqiu and Ni Hao are here. Why not ask Ni Hao to participate?\u201dFu Shan grimaced and shook his head. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s no connection between me and Zhou Huaiqiu. Second, he and Ni Hao have been staying with the Li Family. As you know, last time at the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday, my attitude left Li Tianhan deeply displeased,\u00a0so\u2026.\u201dSu Yi nodded. \u201cI understand. How about this? When the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet starts, I\u2019ll head on over.\u201dNo matter what else he might say, Fu Shan had done him a huge favor back at the Immortal Gathering House. Sure, it had been on another\u2019s orders, but Su Yi couldn\u2019t be ungrateful.Now that Fu Shan had come to him for aid, he naturally wouldn\u2019t just sit back and ignore him.His opponent might be unworthy of consideration, but the lantern-lit river was a sight to behold.Fu Shan was overcome with delight. He clasped his fist and said, \u201cMaster Su, with you there, the outcome is secure. I am no longer the least bit worried!\u201dHe then quickly bade Su Yi farewell and left.Su Yi, meanwhile, turned and entered his room, took off his clothes, and sank into the medicinal bath he\u2019d prepared in his wooden bathtub.He\u2019d agreed to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, but he was still more concerned about his personal cultivation.Over the past few days, Huang Qianjun had brought him a bone broth prepared with boiled medicinal herbs every morning.Add that to his supply of fifty spirit stones, and Su Yi\u2019s cultivation was proceeding at a shocking pace.Just the night before, he\u2019d reached the very pinnacle of the Refining Sinew stage. His tendons and ligaments were like a young dragon\u2019s, soft and flexible, yet bursting with explosive power.If he met the Opening Acupoints stage Wu Ruoqiu now, he could kill him effortlessly.As expected, now that I\u2019ve begun \u2018Refining Bone\u2019, ordinary medicinal herbs have become essentially useless\u2026..\u00a0Before long, Su Yi furrowed his brow and rose from his bath. His body looked lean, but beneath his clear white skin, his muscles were like carved jade.His physique wasn\u2019t exactly \u201cbulky\u201d, but every inch of his skin, flesh, blood, and sinew contained enough power to leave an ordinary martial artist in the dust.He wiped himself off, got dressed, and sat on his bed in the lotus position, a spirit stone in each hand.Refining Bone was the final stage of the Blood Circulation Realm.This stage was far harder to cultivate to perfection than Refining Sinew. The core problem was that tempering one\u2019s skeleton until the \u201cmarrow like frost\u201d level was too difficult!The vast majority of the Great Zhou\u2019s martial artists remained stuck in this stage for their entire lives, unable to achieve higher breakthroughs.Guangling City.Here, Blood Circulation Realm cultivators were as numerous as the hairs on an ox, but there were only a handful of Qi Accumulation Realm experts.This was because it was too difficult to complete \u201cRefining Bone.\u201d It was like an enormous, impassable gorge that prevented many from breaking through to higher realms.But to Su Yi, the challenge wasn\u2019t the process of Refining Bone, but rather, acquiring sufficient cultivation resources to do so.Before this, he could still use ordinary medicinal herbs to support his cultivation, but by now, ordinary medicines were no longer of any use.He needed spiritual medicines, spirit stones, or to cultivate in places with dense spiritual energy!But all three were unquestionably rare within the Great Zhou\u2019s borders.I still have more than thirty first-tier spirit stones. Without any spiritual medicines as supplements, I\u2019ll burn through five spirit stones a day\u2026. I can\u2019t let things go on like this. I should consider leaving Guangling City,\u00a0Su Yi thought as he cultivated.The Great Zhou\u2019s territory was vast, encompassing six provinces and thirty six prefectures.Each province encompassed six prefectures, and each prefecture had numerous cities.Like Cloudriver Prefecture. It was just one of Gunzhou, the Imperatorial Province\u2019s six prefectures. It alone included nineteen cities.Guangling City was just one of them.Within the vast territories of the Great Zhou, Guangling City was just a remote little city at best.Years ago, Su Yi had chosen the Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s Blueriver Sword Manor specifically because he liked how remote it was; it was extremely far from the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family.In doing so, he hoped to escape the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family\u2019s influence.But against all expectations, the very day he lost his cultivation, the Su Family\u2019s power located him almost alright away!As such, shortly after Su Yi reawakened his memories, he made a decision\u2014He\u2019d wait until his cultivation reached the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm to leave Guangling City.That way, he\u2019d have enough strength to fight back should he encounter any trouble.But things\u00a0were\u00a0different now.Guangling City was ultimately too remote to have much in the way of cultivation resources. It was sparse and barren as could be.If he wanted to continue cultivating, he had to consider finding somewhere with more abundant resources.Like the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital.An old saying went, \u201cEven the cleverest housewife can\u2019t cook without ingredients.\u201d Su Yi couldn\u2019t work without resources, either.I don\u2019t have to rush to leave, and no matter what, I have to visit the Azurecloud Mountains before I go.\u00a0Su Yi certainly hadn\u2019t forgotten about the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse in Mother Ghost Ridge, nor about the Six Yin Grass or Extreme Yang Flowers.It was highly likely that an inauspicious yin spirit vein was hidden there!Oh! Rumor has it that Mother Ghost Ridge has a long history of giving rise to various apparitions. When I visit, I should take Qing Wan with me.\u00a0Su Yi recalled the lady ghost in the Soul-Nurturing Gourd, and his eyebrows shot up.The girl\u2019s spiritual affinity wasn\u2019t the least bit shallow!Neither the inauspicious yin spirit vein nor the Six Yin Grasses were useful to him at his current cultivation.But to a low-class yin spirit like her, they were enormously beneficial!Three days later.Countless spectators would watch the curtains open on the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet this very night.Su Yi stepped into the morning light and proceeded to the riverside mulberry grove as always.To him, this was almost no different from any other day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - The Night of the Banquet, Lanterns Like a PaintingThe mulberry grove.Su Yi was unhurried, and his mind was clear and focused as he drilled the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique over and over again.Cultivation.This grand undertaking had always required finding peace in hard work. You had to calm your heart and get down to business.Those with strong wills could persist in perpetuity.\u00a0Those with stalwart hearts could bravely forge ahead.\u00a0These were the two traits universally recognized as necessary for cultivation.No matter how monstrously, peerlessly talented you might be, if you couldn\u2019t persist at your daily cultivation, you would never amount to much.After finishing his practice, Su Yi turned and headed back. When he was just beyond the city gates, he saw thick, black chains stretching all the way across the thousand-foot-wide Great Azure River.Thick stone was laid out across them, forming a thousand-foot-long stone bridge between the two banks of the Great Azure.This was the \u201cDragon\u2019s Gate Bridge.\u201dAnd in the center of the Great Azure, there now stood an arena. It was thirty feet tall and a hundred feet across, formed entirely of black refined iron.This was to be the stage of tonight\u2019s Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.The arena was thus known as the Dragon\u2019s Gate Arena. The name came from the legend of a carp jumping over the Dragon\u2019s Gate and becoming a dragon.There were already countless people walking alongside the riverbank. It was packed and noisy as could be.There was no shortage of civilians here to watch all the excitement.When night fell, no matter whether you came from Guangling City or their neighbors across the river, only those with invitations were allowed onto the Dragon\u2019s Gate Bridge. Others\u00a0couldn\u2019t so much as step\u00a0foot on it.\u201cSu Yi.\u201dA group approached from not far away, Wen Shaobei at their forefront. His arms were crossed, and his eyes were narrowed as he laughed, \u201cWhat about that riffraff friend of yours? Why aren\u2019t you two together?\u201dSu Yi\u2019s brow shot up. It took him a second to realize that Wen Shaobei was talking about Huang Qianjun.\u201cScrew your granny! Who do you think you\u2019re insulting?\u201d Suddenly, someone cursed right back at him.They then turned and saw someone charge out of the crowd, grab Wen Shaobei by the collar, and slap him right across the face.Whap!The resounding slap echoed through their eyes, and Wen Shaobei\u2019s\u00a0cheek visibly\u00a0swelled. Blood dripped from his lips, and he looked completely dazed.\u201cYoung\u2026. Young Master Huang!?\u201d Wen Shaobei was stunned senseless.Just now, Huang Qianjun was nowhere to be seen! Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have dared insult Su Yi right to his face.He never would have guessed that as soon as the insults left his lips, the delinquent young master, Huang Qianjun, would charge at him!The Wen Family youths behind Wen Shaobei looked frantic and bewildered.\u201cYou really don\u2019t learn, do you?\u201d said Huang Qianjun with a hideous grin. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll go right ahead and break your dog legs!\u201dBut just as he was about to act\u2026.\u201cStay your hand!\u201d An angry snort rang out. No one knew when he\u2019d arrived, but\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan hurried over, his handsome face utterly cold.Whap!But Huang Qianjun nevertheless slapped Wen Shaobei\u2019s other cheek, making him cough up blood and giving him a nosebleed. He looked as if his face had exploded; he was bleeding, but also crying and\u00a0dribbling\u00a0snot.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Wen Jueyuan\u2019s eyes glinted with cold light; he was clearly infuriated.But a moment later, his body went rigid. He\u2019d just sensed a pair of cold eyes boring into him.When he turned to look, he saw the dignified, imposing, purple-clad head of the Huang Family, Huang Yunchong, staring expressionlessly at him!Wen Jueyuan instantly cleared his head.He took a deep breath, repressed his rage, then said coldly, \u201cHuang Qianjun, do you remember what I said that day? If you\u2019ve got the balls, how about we spar at tonight\u2019s Dragon Gate Banquet?\u201dWithout even stopping to think, Huang Qianjun said, \u201cSure, why not?\u201dHe then tossed Wen Shaobei away and clapped gleefully. \u201cWen Jueyuan, I\u2019ve been waiting for this day for a long time!\u201dHis eyes brimmed with viciousness and the blazing will to fight.Wen Jueyuan was surprised to see him like this; he seemed like a stranger. Despite himself, he furrowed his brow.Shortly after, he said coldly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll see you tonight. We\u2019re leaving!\u201dWen Jueyuan\u2019s sleeves swung as he turned and left.Wen Shaobei and the others scampered after him, both indignant and ashamed.\u201cWho the hell does he think he is?\u201d Huang Qianjun spat, but when he turned to face Su Yi, he was nothing but smiles. \u201cBrother Su, he didn\u2019t anger you, did he?\u201dSu Yi shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d best consider how you\u2019re going to face him tonight. I\u2019m going on ahead.\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t have guessed that just standing there would result in such an interlude.Before long, Su Yi disappeared through the city gates.\u201cSo, is Young Lord Su going to participate in the banquet tonight?\u201d Huang Yunchong approached from afar.He\u2019d originally planned to greet Su Yi, but when he saw that he\u2019d already passed through the city gates, he conscientiously decided against it.\u201cI asked him a few days ago, but the banquet isn\u2019t enough to interest him.\u201d Huang Qianjun shook his head.Despite himself, Huang Yunchong was a little disappointed. He muttered, \u201cAnd here we wanted to\u00a0arrange him\u00a0a seat in the VIP spectator area.\u201dThen, his expression turned solemn. \u201cMy boy, if you encounter\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan tonight, you mustn\u2019t fight to the bitter end. When you lose the advantage, admit defeat. There\u2019s no shame in that.\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d grunted Huang Qianjun. \u201cFather, I\u2019m not afraid of losing.\u201dHuang Qianjun sighed. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, the Li Family\u2019s Li Moyun won\u2019t be participating. That means that, throughout all of Guangling City, only Wen Jueyuan has high hopes of seizing first place.\u201cEven if you\u2019re no match for him, there\u2019s no need to get discouraged. With the miraculous art Su Yi taught us, your future accomplishments are sure to far surpass Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s!\u201dAs he said this, Huang Yunchong\u2019s spirits soared, and he broke into a broad smile.Huang Qianjun nodded.Upon returning to the Apricot Cottage, Su Yi began practicing his sword arts.Although he\u2019d regained the experience and memories of his past life, he wouldn\u2019t slack off on his cultivation even a little.Otherwise, there was no point in even talking about surpassing his past self\u2019s accomplishments in the Dao of the Sword.It was only after\u00a0night set in that\u00a0Su Yi left the courtyard.On the way, he bumped into Steward Hu Quan. \u201cSir, do you plan to go to the banquet too?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Su Yi nodded.\u201cThat works out perfectly! We can go together. I\u2019ve already rented a boat. In a bit, I\u2019ll arrange for drinks and side dishes. We can float on the surface of the lake, admire the lamp-lit fishing boats, and watch the competition. It\u2019ll be too sublime for words!\u201d said Hu Quan with a hearty laugh.Su Yi was stunned. \u201cYou rented a boat?\u201dHu Quan explained, \u201cWithout an invitation, you cannot step\u00a0onto\u00a0the Dragon\u2019s Gate Bridge. If you want to spectate anyway, you naturally need to board one of the numerous boats gathered here and watch from a distance.Su Yi then pulled a gold-embossed invitation from his sleeve. \u201cIs this one of the invitations you\u2019re talking about?\u201dHu Quan\u2019s eyes instantly lit up with surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s a VIP invitation, the most prestigious kind! With that, you can enter the VIP seating area and sit alongside the city lord!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Su Yi. He put it away, then asked, \u201cIf I have this, can I bring others with me?\u201d\u201cOf course you can,\u201d said Hu Quan without hesitation.\u201cThen come with me.\u201d With that, Su Yi headed toward the bridge.Hu Quan was briefly stunned. When he came to his senses, he hurried after Su Yi, his heart bursting with delight. He never would have guessed that tonight, he\u2019d have the opportunity to step onto the Dragon\u2019s Gate Bridge!Meanwhile, in a restaurant not far from the Apricot Clinic.A valiant-looking man whispered, \u201cYoung Master, that Su Yi has already left the Apricot Clinic. Based on the direction he headed in, it seems he\u2019s going to watch the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.\u201dEven most of the Li Family thought Li Moyun had begun his journey back to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital days ago, and that he didn\u2019t plan to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.In truth, he\u2019d remained in Guangling City this entire time, secretly preparing to wipe Su Yi out.The way Li Moyun saw it, killing Su Yi would be as easy as turning over his hand. That part wasn\u2019t even worthy of consideration.What concerned him was how to kill Su Yi without leaving behind any evidence.And tonight, while practically everyone of note was at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, was undoubtedly an ideal chance to take Su Yi out.Not even gods or ghosts would know what had happened!\u201cThen we\u2019ll just wait for him to get back,\u201d said Li Moyun indifferently. \u201cHave someone hide behind the Apricot Clinic and await my orders.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The subordinate scampered off to obey.\u201cLingzhao, once I dispose of that waste, Su Yi, I\u2019ll go looking for you at Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. Then, you\u2019ll no longer need to fret over this unfortunate sham of a marriage\u2026.\u201d\u00a0Li Moyun drained a cup of wine as he muttered to himself.\u2026\u2026Outside the city.Darkness fell, like ink gradually spreading across the dome of heaven.The grand and imposing Great Azure was covered in densely-packed boats, clustering around the Dragon\u2019s Gate Bridge.Every boat was well-lit with lanterns and covered in people.Looking from a distance, hundreds of barges clustered together, and a thousand sails billowed in the wind. Countless lanterns cast their lights against the river\u2019s surface, like a galaxy descending onto the mortal world, and brilliant and colorful as a painting.The lamplight flickered in the breeze, illuminating the water\u2019s surface. Lights intersected, like countless stars flickering on and off, radiant against the darkness.When he saw this, even Su Yi, who\u2019d only just stepped through the city gates, was struck by its beauty. \u201cEven the grandest spectacles of heaven cannot surpass the beauty of the human world\u2019s lights. This really is worth a look.\u201dHu Quan was already overcome with astonishment. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this spectacle several times already, but every time, it shakes me to the core. This is the annual Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, the grandest occasion in Guangling City, something worth looking forward to all year!\u201dIt was indeed quite lively.Practically all of the citizens had come, families in tow. They clustered along the riverbank, the festivities crowded and lively as could be.They were just here to see the lanterns and the scenery.After all, they were too far from the Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition to see anything.Those with the money and authority had long-since hired boats so they could watch from the surface of the lake. They\u2019d drink as they commented on the matches; it was sure to be a delight!The fierce elites of the city lords\u2019 guards kept watch on both ends of the bridge.Only those with invitations were allowed to step foot onto the bridge and enter the banquet\u2019s main venue.When Su Yi arrived, he was just about to show off his invitation when a guard walked right up to him with a warm, welcoming smile. \u201cYoung Lord Su, the city\u00a0lord gave\u00a0us special orders in advance: tonight, you\u2019re a first-class VIP guest. Please, come this way!\u201dHu Quan watched from the sides, and despite himself, he was stunned.\u00a0Since when did the son-in-law of the Wen Family have such a transcendent position? Even the city lord values him so highly?He doesn\u2019t even need an invitation to attend the banquet!\u201cThank you.\u201d Su Yi nodded, but he wasn\u2019t surprised.Suddenly, a surprised voice rang out. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, don\u2019t tell me you want to participate in the banquet too?\u201dSu Yi turned and saw Nan Ying standing nearby, surprise written on her pretty face. It seemed she hadn\u2019t expected to see him here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - I\u2019ve Reserved this Seat for a Distinguished GuestTonight, Nan Ying was all dolled up, and she looked even more exquisitely beautiful than usual.Her snowy-white skirt fluttered in the wind, outlining her curves. She had her hair up in a bun, showing off her long, fair-skinned neck. Her eyes were bright and clear, and her lips were pink and full.When she stood there in all her glory, the radiant lamplight seemed dimmer by comparison. Who knew how many gazes she drew? Some of the nearby men were visibly infatuated.When she saw Su Yi, Nan Ying bit her lip, a hint of darkness flickering through her gaze. \u201cI just thought that without your cultivation, you wouldn\u2019t be interested in a spectacle like this, but don\u2019t overthink it. I\u2019m definitely not saying that to make fun of you.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t so much as waver. It was as if he hadn\u2019t even heard her; he couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay her any heed.In his past life, he\u2019d detested nothing more than two-faced women like her.\u201cSu Yi, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d Suddenly, there was a disturbance within the crowd, and a group of people walked toward them. All of them were well-dressed, with the dignified bearing of one long accustomed to power.The speaker was the elder leading the group. His hair was graying, but he seemed hale and hearty, and when he opened his eyes, they seemed to crackle with electricity. He was imposing as could be.But when his gaze landed on Su Yi, his expression turned somewhat\u00a0pained.\u201cUncle Master Zhou.\u201d Su Yi clasped his fist.This was the \u201cBluepeak Sword Elder\u201d Zhou Huaiqiu, the fourth-ranked elder of Blueriver Sword Manor.During Su Yi\u2019s time as an outer sect disciple, Zhou Huaiqiu had admired and thought highly of him. He\u2019d looked out for him quite a bit.At the same time, Su Yi noticed that Ni Hao, Family Head Li Tianhan, and various other Li Family members were here too.Zhou Huaiqiu sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve already heard a bit about your life in Guangling City. Still, no matter what happens, you mustn\u2019t sink into despair. Living well comes first.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s expression went a bit strange, but he nodded.Zhou Huaiqiu hesitated, then whispered, \u201cSu Yi, forgive me if my words are grating to the ear, but I encourage you to leave Wen Lingzhao\u2019s side as soon as possible. She\u2019s already a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple. You ought to understand the weight of this status, and you\u2026. Well, you two simply aren\u2019t destined to be together.\u201dWhen he said this, he reached out to pat Su Yi on the shoulder comfortingly, as if afraid his words had hurt him.\u201cApprentice Brother Su, Uncle Master is saying this for your benefit. Please don\u2019t misunderstand,\u201d said Nan Ying gently. \u201cIt\u2019s just, we all know that, in your current position, remaining the nominal husband of a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple like Wen Lingzhao will only hurt you.\u201dAlthough she said this, a glint of schadenfreude flashed through her eyes.Su Yi ignored Nan Ying completely, looking instead at Zhou Huaiqiu. \u201cUncle Master Zhou, I\u2019ve actually been planning to annul this marriage for a long time now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said Zhou Huaiqiu, seemingly gratified. \u201cNow I can relax.\u201dA hint of a jeer tugged at Nan Ying\u2019s lips.\u00a0Is this still the proud outer sect Sword Chief I once knew?It seems his year as a live-in son-in-law has worn away his pride; he\u2019s had no choice but to lower his head in the face of cruel reality.Ni Hao, meanwhile, just watched coldly. He paid Su Yi no heed.After all, Martial artists and commoners lived in two different worlds.Seeing their response, Su Yi instantly realized that they\u2019d misunderstood.He wanted to end his marriage, but that was just because he didn't want to \u201cwear a green hat\u201d and not even know it!Why should he care about the trouble \u201ca Grandmaster\u2019s disciple\u201d might bring him?Su Yi shook his head, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain.Li Tianhan had been silent all this time, but he suddenly interjected, \u201cBrother Zhou, the banquet is about to start. How about we proceed to the venue?\u201dZhou Huaiqiu nodded, then turned to Su Yi. \u201cDid they stop you here because you don\u2019t have an invitation? If so, you can just come with us.\u201dWith that, he strode forward, and the others hurriedly followed him.The members of the Old Guard stepped aside, not daring to stand in their way.Hu Quan couldn\u2019t help but whisper, \u201cSir, it seems they\u2019ve misunderstood. You\u00a0do\u00a0have an invitation, and a VIP invitation at that. City Lord Fu Shan even told the guards\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy concern ourselves with that?\u201d Su Yi laughed and cut him off. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry inside.\u201dWith that, he strode across the bridge, hands behind his back.Hu Quan hurried after him. He was just a little steward, and he certainly had no invitation. He had to stay close to Su Yi.The night gradually darkened.At the center of the Dragon\u2019s Gate Bridge, in the platform over the waters of the Great Azure and around the hundred-meter arena, stood numerous tables and chairs. Blazing torches illuminated the entire area.When the competition started, this was to be the center of countless spectators\u2019 attention!Numerous influential figures of both Guangling and Cloudfall cities were already seated around the arena.On Guangling City\u2019s side, there was City Lord Fu Shan, the commander of the guards, Nie Beihu, and Family Head Huang Yunchong, among others.The Wen Family was present too, but since Family Head Wen Changjing had left for Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy several days ago, the main line\u2019s second elder, Wen Changqing, was here in his stead.There were numerous influential figures from Cloudfall City too, including City Lord Li Jianyu, as well as Mo Haolong, the head of the Mo Family, the city\u2019s top clan.When Zhou Huaiqiu\u2019s group arrived, both cities\u2019 higher-ups rose to their feet and greeted them with a smile.This scene instantly stirred up a commotion within the surrounding area.\u201cLook over there! Hurry! That\u2019s the \u2018Bluepeak Sword Elder\u2019 Zhou Huaiqiu! He\u2019s a prominent figure at Blueriver Sword Manor!\u201d\u201cAt this year\u2019s Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition, whoever manages to impress him will be directly admitted to the Blueriver Sword Manor!\u201d\u201cWho is that woman? She\u2019s just so beautiful!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a Blueriver Sword Manor inner sect disciple. Her name is Nan Ying, and she\u2019s like a fairy. She\u2019s renowned for her beauty even in Cloudriver Prefecture!\u201d\u201cIf, one day, I could participate in the banquet too, I\u2019d die happy\u2026.\u201d\u2026.Sails dotted the surrounding parts of the river, their lights dazzling to behold. Every last passenger watched with bated breath, their gazes full of longing.The banquet was an event for the influential, a place where important people gathered.To the inhabitants of both cities, participating was an enormous honor!Amidst the crowd\u2019s fervent discussions, Zhou Huaiqiu, Li Tianhan, Nan Ying, Ni Hao and the others took their seats.Suddenly, Li Tianhan seemed to notice something. \u201cBrother Fu, it seems almost everyone is here, but there\u2019s still an empty seat beside you. Might I ask who it\u2019s for?\u201dWhen the other influential figures heard that, all of them looked over curiously.City Lord Fu Shan was one of the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet\u2019s hosts. He was naturally right in the center of the venue, with a front-row seat to the competition. His view was excellent.Yet there was indeed an empty seat beside him.Fu Shan laughed. \u201cI prepared this for a distinguished guest. As for who specifically he is, please forgive me for keeping you in suspense.\u201dThe crowd was stunned. Their thoughts raced as they tried to guess just who he was referring to.A distinguished guest?\u00a0Which distinguished guest?Could it be someone even more distinguished than Zhou Huaiqiu?Huang Yunchong and Nie Beihu glanced at each other. They could vaguely guess who that seat was for, and the thought sent waves coursing through their hearts.It might look like it was just the seat next to the city lord, but its significance was far greater than that! But then, if City Lord Fu didn\u2019t want to reveal anything, they knew better than to do it for him.At the same time, numerous people gathered near the banquet venue.These were the youths of the cities\u2019 various clans and factions.They weren\u2019t qualified to sit at the banquet, so they could only stand nearby and watch.\u201cEe? Su Yi, how did you get in here?\u201dWhen Su Yi and Hu Quan arrived, they were quickly recognized.The speaker was none other than Wen Shaobei! He looked bewildered, as if he dared not believe that Su Yi was participating too.The nearby Wen Family youths were stunned too.Su Yi glanced at Wen Shaobei. He almost couldn\u2019t help but admire him; there was just something about him that made people want to hit him. It was almost like an innate talent of his.Earlier that day, Huang Qianjun had slapped him viciously, twice. His swelling had yet to go down, but here he was, cruising for another bruising already.\u201cHe\u2019s Su Yi? Agh, a waste became the husband of a grandmaster\u2019s disciple. It\u2019s against the natural order of things!\u201dMany nearby disciples of major sects and clans began gossiping about Su Yi in hushed tones, but Su Yi didn\u2019t care. His gaze was calm, and he was focused on enjoying the beauty of the lamplit night sky.Lanterns shone like stars, stretching as far as the eye could see and bobbing with the current. The light shifted with the water, the sight stunning to behold.When he saw that Su Yi wasn\u2019t saying anything, Wen Shaobei snorted coldly, then looked away.Tonight was the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. With so many influential people present, no one would dare act up.Boom! Boom! Boom!The sound of drums reverberated through the night sky, the sound powerful and deep, spreading far and wide.The commoners clustered on both sides of the river instantly grew excited. When the drum sounded, it meant that the competition was about to begin!The conversation in the banquet venue stopped immediately as everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards the Dragon\u2019s Gate Arena.The Guangling City Lord, Fu Shan, and the Cloudfall City Lord, Li Jianyu, had both taken the stage, becoming the center of attention.Su Yi looked over too.Li Jianyu wore robes embroidered with silver dragons. He was tall, and although he was getting on in years, his presence was imposing.As the drums slowed to a halt, Li Jianyu\u2019s gaze swept across the surrounding area. He said in a low voice, \u201cTonight\u2019s Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition will be different than in prior years. City Lord Fu Shan and I have discussed it, and we\u2019ve agreed that for the next ten years, control over Spiritbamboo Island will go to whichever city the champion of tonight\u2019s competition hails from!The venue instantly burst into uproar. The people were beside themselves with shock.It was clear that\u00a0they\u2019d had\u00a0no idea, and the news came as a big surprise.Once the uproar finally died down, Li Jianyu smiled and said, \u201cThis year, we\u2019re fortunate enough to have Blueriver Sword Manor elder Zhou Huaiqiu in attendance. He can act as a witness.\u201dZhou Huaiqiu rose from his seat and smiled back. \u201cIt would be my honor.\u201d\u201cHahaha, Brother Zhou, please take a seat.\u201d Li Jianyu let out a burst of hearty laughter, then glanced at Fu Shan. \u201cCity Lord Fu, there\u2019s no problem with me saying that, right?\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Fu Shan smiled faintly, looking calm and composed.\u201cGreat!\u201d Li Jianyu waved. \u201cIn that case, there is no need to delay any longer. Let\u2019s begin the Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition now!\u201dWith that, both he and Fu Shan withdrew, clearing the stage.Almost immediately, someone streaked over from Cloudfall City\u2019s side of the venue.\u201cWho from Guangling City wishes to participate in the first match?\u201d The speaker was a youth in silver-robes, a sheathed knife at his waist.He was dashing, dignified, and charismatic, and his entrance immediately drew every gaze present.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - As the Crowd Watches the Combat, I Alone Admire the Lamplit BoatsCloudfall City, Peng Qianqiu!There was an uproar throughout the venue as everyone recognized the man who\u2019d taken the stage. He was a top-class talent within Cloudfall City\u2019s younger generation, with a cultivation in the Refining Sinew stage of the Blood Circulation Realm.Before long, a youth named Wu\u00a0Zhuanghei\u00a0stepped up to represent Guangling City.The two briefly greeted each other, and the fierce competition began.From time to time, cheers exploded from the stands.The atmosphere was starting to heat up, but although the VIP guests watched and made the odd comment, they were far calmer by comparison.\u00a0They knew this was just the beginning.Su Yi stood amidst the crowd, but after watching for just a few seconds, he inwardly shook his head.\u00a0For him, sparring at this level was far too boring. It wasn\u2019t even worth watching.His gaze shifted, landing on the river.\u00a0By comparison, the lamplit river and night sky were spectacular.The lamps shone, the sails billowed, and every boat was packed to the brims with spectators, the sound of conversation, laughter, and cheering filling the air\u2026The sound of bamboo flutes emanated from the \u201cflower boats\u201d, with sultry songstresses dancing to add to the excitement.Meanwhile, although the ordinary people clustered along the river couldn\u2019t see the competition, they could hear it from a distance, and that was enough to excite them beyond measure.Everyone was here for the spectacle!As for who won and who lost, only those involved cared one way or another.Human life, with all its complexities, was on full display here alongside the lanterns\u4e00and this was what made it interesting.As he silently took in this grand spectacle, Su Yi suddenly felt like the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet wasn\u2019t so boring after all.One match after another played out on stage, the\u00a0participants all\u00a0youths from the two neighboring cities. All of them were eighteen or under, and their cultivations were, without exception, in the Blood Circulation Realm.They fought, then won and lost.According to the rules, victory was decided when no one dared challenge the person on stage. The last remaining fighter would then be crowned champion.About fifteen minutes later.Nie Beihu\u2019s son, Nie Teng, took the stage. This actually did pique a hint of interest from Su Yi, and he glanced over.Nie Teng was valiant, brave, and composed. He was already the man of the hour at Pinecloud Sword Manor, and his appearance caused a fair bit of commotion.Some of the higher-ups even ceased their conversation so they could watch him fight.Nie Teng didn\u2019t let them down, either. He displayed a cultivation that far surpassed his peers. Even more unusually, he clearly had ample combat experience.He went on to win thirteen matches in a row!\u00a0These were the best results since the start of the competition.\u00a0The spectators erupted with unprecedented enthusiasm, cheering him on vigorously.According to the rules, if Nie Teng won just two more matches, he could step off the stage to rest, then continue participating whenever he recovered.But in his fourteenth match, he encountered a difficult rival. In the end, he lost.Many thought this a pity, but no one made fun of him.This was because thirteen successive victories was an excellent result; it made him a dazzling figure among the younger generation.His temperament is quite good, and he\u2019s got a decent amount of experience, all things considered. It's obvious that he\u2019s polished his skills through no-holds-barred combat, too. Unfortunately, his cultivation technique and martial arts are a bit crude\u2026.\u00a0Su Yi had watched every match, and he now understood Nie Teng\u2019s foundations in detail.As he pondered, shockingly, Huang Qianjun strode onto the arena.Su Yi\u2019s brow shot up.\u00a0That kid can\u2019t keep his calm. His temperament needs work.But when the audience saw Huang Qianjun defeat his opponent as easily as breaking rotten wood, it stirred up an enormous uproar throughout the venue. The air was practically boiling over with excitement.This was because Huang Qianjun\u2019s opponent was the very same person who\u2019d just defeated Nie Teng! This only highlighted Nie Teng\u2019s relative inferiority; he was far weaker than Huang Qianjun.What really made people gasp was that none of them had guessed that Huang Qianjun, the famed delinquent silkpants, actually had such impressive combat skills! Several of the influential guests were stunned, and they now saw him in an entirely new light.\u201cBrother Huang, your kid\u2019s quite something!\u201d\u201cWhat a surprise! It\u2019s true what they say; a tiger won\u2019t have a dog for a son.\u201d\u2026.As many notable figures sighed with admiration, Huang Yunchong beamed, and his heart filled with pride.He was naturally well aware of his son\u2019s poor reputation! How could he\u00a0not\u00a0know?But who would dare look down on his son now?This is all thanks to Young Lord Su\u2019s guidance,\u00a0he thought to himself. Just thinking about Su Yi filled him with uncontrollable awe.\u201cHow do you feel, my son?\u201d Nie Beihu watched the high-spirited, valiant Huang Qianjun, then turned to his son, who\u2019d only just returned in defeat. His emotions were in turmoil.He was naturally well aware that Huang Qianjun\u2019s metamorphosis was entirely thanks to Su Yi!Had my boy gone along with my arrangements and followed Su Yi, had he too received help with his cultivation, how could he possibly be weaker than Huang Qianjun?\u00a0The more he thought about it, the worse Nie Beihu felt.\u201cFather, I\u2019m not upset,\u201d said Nie Teng, calm and clear-headed. \u201cA single loss isn\u2019t enough to throw me off balance. On the contrary, my loss has taught me what I\u2019m lacking. So long as I learn from it, it\u2019s sure to help me take another step further down the path\u00a0of the Martial\u00a0Dao.\u201dNie Beihu was briefly stunned. Then, his complex emotions disappeared, and he seemed gratified. \u201cYou\u2019re neither arrogant when you win nor upset when you lose. With such mental fortitude, you\u2019re sure to achieve greatness one day.\u201dSuddenly, Huang Qianjun\u2019s voice rang out from the stage,\u201d Wen Jueyuan, do you dare face me now?\u201dAs this\u00a0shout\u00a0rang out, the lively atmosphere and fervent discussion came to a sudden standstill. Everyone\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief.Even the VIP guests were shocked.Wen Jueyuan!He was a dazzling figure, a contender for the number-one spot. Everyone in Guangling City thought well of his chances.Even some of the Cloudfall City youths saw him as their number-one opponent!Who would have guessed that Huang Qianjun would challenge him at a time like this?After a brief lull, the entire venue burst into uproar.\u201cBrother Huang, when did that kid of yours become so gutsy?\u201d Li Tianhan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. His words carried a hint of mockery.\u201cThis is the type of hot-bloodedness a youth ought to have,\u201d said Huang Yunchong, not the least bit annoyed.City Lord Fu Shan laughed and chimed in, \u201cHe really is hot-blooded, and courageous. That\u2019s worthy of praise even if he loses.\u201d\u201cIndeed, he\u2019s commendable.\u201d Zhou Huaiqiu nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t compliment that kid,\u201d laughed Huang Yunchong, waving dismissively. \u201cHe\u2019s just stubborn, that\u2019s all.\u201dAlthough he said that, Zhou Huaiqiu\u2019s compliment, brief as it was, made him feel great.After all, it represented the approval of a Blueriver Sword Manor inner sect elder!\u201cHah.\u201d Li Tianhan laughed coldly but said nothing.As for Wen Changqing, his thoughts were elsewhere throughout this conversation.He\u2019d only just lost his son, and his personality had changed dramatically. He\u2019d been silent and sullen ever since he took his seat, and he neither ate nor drank.Meanwhile, when the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation saw Huang Qianjun challenge Wen Jueyuan, they burst into cold laughter.\u201cHuang\u00a0Qianjun\u2019s\u00a0insane! His pride has gone to his head!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how he loses!\u201dEspecially\u00a0Wen\u00a0Shaobei. He gnashed his teeth, his eyes glinting with excitement. \u201cThat silkpants brought this humiliation on himself.\u201dBefore long, and beneath countless gazes, Wen Jueyuan walked onto the stage.His robes were whiter than snow, and he was tall and upright, a longsword strapped to his waist. His arrival drew a round of cheers, and many of the teenage girls shrieked with excitement.Whatever else you might say about him, Wen Jueyuan was extremely popular, with countless people eager to watch his every move.\u201cAnd here I thought you\u2019d chicken out,\u201d said Wen Jueyuan as he took the stage. He didn\u2019t expect Huang Qianjun to take the initiative to challenge him.\u201cSkip the nonsense!\u201d Even before he finished saying this, Huang Qianjun charged.He charged like a grand mountain in motion, incomparably domineering.His hands displayed the Form-Intention Six Harmonies Fist. With each punch, his hands, elbows, waist, and hips moved, and his body coiled like a rope, filling every strike with explosive power and overbearing ferocity.He inhaled and exhaled, smoothly linking both stillness and movement, striking like a deity beating a celestial drum, shaking both heaven and earth!\u201cEh?\u201d Numerous major powers\u2019 pupils constricted. With their keen senses, they could tell that Huang Qianjun\u2019s fist technique was extraordinary, and that it had an imposing momentum.\u201cHow did that silkpants change so much\u2026.?\u201d Li Tianhan furrowed his brow.But when Wen Jueyuan made his move, everyone\u2019s eyes lit up.They watched as\u2014He shifted lightly on his feet, and with a wave of his hand, broke Huang Qianjun\u2019s momentum. He was clearly relaxed and at ease, with skill and power to spare.Furthermore, as the battle continued, Wen Jueyuan advanced step by step, his fists stirring up a flurry of blows, his attacks fierce and in rapid succession. Amidst his air of casual ease, he had a fierce, imposing momentum.Before long, Huang Qianjun was on the defensive. All he could do was bitterly withstand Wen Jueyuan\u2019s attacks and hope that he\u2019d slip up; only then could he find a chance to counter-attack.Gasps rang out repeatedly throughout the venue. The stands were in uproar.This match was unquestionably more spectacular and exciting than those that came before!Both Huang Qianjun and Wen Jueyuan revealed foundations in the Martial Dao that even the major powers in attendance couldn\u2019t look away from.Wen Jueyuan\u2019s strength was well within expectations.But they hadn\u2019t guessed that Huang Qianjun could hold out against Wen Jueyuan\u2019s attacks!This was entirely unexpected!If things go on like this, Huang Qianjun is sure to lose.\u00a0Su Yi had been watching this whole time, and he already had his answer.Huang Qianjun had made an enormous amount of progress, but he was ultimately still a level below Wen Jueyuan. He couldn\u2019t make up for such a gap, not on such short notice.Still, so long as Huang Qianjun didn\u2019t slack off, he was certain to one day surpass Wen Jueyuan.As expected, the match was soon decided.Huang Qianjun had lost!Although he bitterly hung on in hopes of his opponent slipping up and giving him the chance to counterattack, Wen Jueyuan never gave him the opportunity.This was the leader and most dazzling figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation, someone who displayed terrifying power far beyond his peers. In the end, he called upon his Chop-Hanging Fist to break through Huang Qianjun\u2019s defenses and strike him in the chest!Bam!Huang Qianjun staggered back and fell. He tried struggling back to his feet, only to fall back down again.It was then that the audience saw it: the cloth over his chest had been ripped apart, and there was the imprint of a palm sunk deep into his flesh!Many young talents gasped and felt chills run down their spines.The power Wen Jueyuan had just revealed was unquestionably domineering!The city fell silent, but only for a second. Then, the air exploded with heaven-shaking cheers. Everyone was screaming over\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s glorious victory. Even some of the higher-ups couldn\u2019t help but applaud.Everyone in the Wen Family, higher-ups and youths alike, lit up with joy.Wen Jueyuan\u2019s victory brought honor to the entire family.He had undoubtedly become the center of attention, and his white robes seemed brighter than the snow.Seth's ThoughtsThe\u00a0\u201cChop-Hanging Fist\u201d\u00a0that Wen Jueyuan uses here is a real martial art, and it emphasizes explosive, long-range power.Also, the\u00a0\u201cflower boats\u201d\u00a0are floating brothels, and they\u2019re real. At least, they were. Don\u2019t expect to see them on your next trip to Shanghai, but they were apparently once a common sight in major Chinese harbors.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Riding the Waves, a Single Punch to Shock Them AllWen Jueyuan stood on stage and said coldly, \u201cYour Martial Dao has improved enormously, but if you think you\u2019re a match for me, you think too highly of yourself.\u201dHuang Qianjun wiped the blood from his lips and struggled to his feet. When he spoke, his voice was raspy. \u201cGive me a year, and I\u2019ll leave you in the dust.\u201dWith that, he turned and stepped off the stage.Wen Jueyuan furrowed his brow, then shook his head and disregarded this threat.\u00a0These were nothing but the angry words of a loser, unworthy of concern.Huang Qianjun staggered over to Huang Yunchong\u2019s side, then feigned calm. \u201cFather, that\u2019s the best I can do right now. Please don\u2019t be disappointed in me.Huang Yunchong rose and pulled his son into a tight embrace, looking proud and deeply gratified. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d last this long. You might have lost, but you lost with honor!\u201dHuang Qianjun grinned, showing his teeth.His gaze swept across the venue, but to his disappointment, the person he most wanted to see was nowhere in sight.Meanwhile, both in and out of the venue, the spectators continued cheering\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s name with great enthusiasm.Everyone from Guangling City, from the VIPs to the people watching from nearby boats to the civilians clustered on the riverbanks, burst into animated discussion.Many of the higher-ups whispered, \u201cWith momentum like this, it seems this year\u2019s number one spot will go to Guangling City\u2019s Wen Family.\u201dAnother man stroked his whiskers and laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s to be expected. After all, Wen Jueyuan is a Blueriver Sword Manor inner sect disciple, a young talent at the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm. It would be a joke if he\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0seize the championship!\u201d\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Ni, what do you think of Senior Apprentice Brother Wen? He\u2019s certainly made a name for himself tonight; no one else has even come close.\u201d Nan Ying\u2019s gaze shifted, and she leaned close to Ni Hao and whispered in his ear, her breath tickling his skin like a lotus.When he saw her beautiful face at such close quarters and took in her faint fragrance, Ni Hao felt a fire burning in his chest.\u00a0His expression filled with pride and contempt. \u201cWen Jueyuan\u00a0cultivates\u00a0in the West Court, while\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0from the East Court. Junior Apprentice Sister, how could you compare the two of us?\u00a0Were\u00a0I to participate, I\u2019d\u00a0best\u00a0him with ease!\u201dNan Ying smiled amorously at him. \u201cI love nothing more than that confident, disdainful side of you. That\u2019s what a man is supposed to be like!\u201dHearing that, Ni Hao felt downright blissful, but outwardly, he sighed. \u201cAlas, we\u2019re just here as guests. According to the rules, only inhabitants of Guangling and Cloudfall Cities are allowed to participate. Otherwise, I\u2019d be sure to let you watch as I took Wen Jueyuan down within ten moves!\u201dThere was much discussion on Cloudfall City\u2019s side as well.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Wen Jueyuan a bit too strong?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an inner sect disciple of the Blueriver Sword Manor, yet he\u2019s still participating in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition? Isn\u2019t that practically bullying everyone else?\u201d\u201cAgh, don\u2019t tell me this year\u2019s championship will fall to Guangling City?\u201d\u2026.In stark contrast with Guangling City\u2019s excitement, Cloudfall City\u2019s spectators sighed and lamented.Many of the youths who\u2019d come planning to participate shrunk back, not daring to take the stage.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me no one from Cloudfall City dares do battle? In that case, the championship shall go to our Guangling City\u2019s Wen Jueyuan!\u201d shouted one of the Guangling City higher-ups.A burst of jeers followed this proclamation.Many of the Cloudfall City higher-ups\u2019 expressions soured.Only City Lord Li Jianyu remained calm.When he saw this, he thought for a moment, then turned to Family Head Mo Haolong. \u201cBrother Mo, it\u2019s getting late. How about we open Fu Shan and the other\u2019s eyes?\u201dMo Haolong smiled and nodded. \u201cAs you wish.\u201dHe suddenly took a deep breath, then bellowed \u201cTianling, where are you? Why aren\u2019t you on stage yet?\u201dHis voice boomed like thunder, and shockingly, it suppressed the discussion in the stands.The spectators were confused.\u00a0Has City Lord Li Jianyu arranged for some expert to take the stage?Almost no one knew what was going on.But although no one noticed it, Fu Shan\u2019s fists clenched silently, and his gaze shifted.Only he knew that, for the sake of claiming Spiritbamboo Island, Li Jianyu was about to play his real trump card!\u201cIt\u2019s just a match. Why put on airs? How awfully droll.\u201d\u00a0Su Yi suddenly seemed to sense something, and his gaze flitted toward the water\u2019s surface. He shook his head.\u201cHm?\u201d\u00a0Shortly after, Zhou Huaiqiu, Li Tianhan, Huang Yunchong, and the other higher-ups looked over as well. All of them were looking in the same direction.Then, everyone else noticed that something was amiss. The sound of discussion decreased.It was then that a startled shout emanated from further down the river\u2019s surface.Past the countless lanterns, a sudden wave crashed towards the venue at shocking speeds, like a flood dragon surging through the river.\u00a0The resulting waves pushed who-knows-how-many boats to the sides, and countless lanterns shook violently, threatening to capsize.The commotion drew countless spectators' attention.\u00a0They could already see clearly: there was a person riding on that wave, racing across the surface of the Great Azure as if he were flying across the water.Beneath the light of countless lanterns, he looked like a deity riding in on the waves!\u201cThat\u2026 Is that a person?\u201d someone lost control and cried out.Even the higher-ups were visibly shaken, their eyes widening in unconcealed disbelief.Riding the waves? Walking on the surface of the river?Only someone at the Astral Manifestation stage of the Qi Accumulation Realm could accomplish such a feat!Of those in attendance, only Zhou Huaiqiu has such skills.Don\u2019t tell me this new arrival is a late-stage Qi Accumulation Realm expert?Beneath everyone\u2019s stunned, confused gazes, that youth who came rushing in on the waves like a god or demon stretched, then jumped into the air and landed elegantly on the stage.When he saw the spectators\u2019 shocked expressions, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, as if he found this awfully funny.\u201cEveryone, please don\u2019t jump to conclusions. I came here riding on a wooden board; I\u2019m certainly no Qi Accumulation expert.\u201d He was lean, with coppery skin, a black military uniform, and a sheathed warblade strapped to his back. There was a long, thin knife scar between his eyebrows, and he emanated a vicious, bloodthirsty air.It was only then that the audience noticed that there was indeed a wooden board on the surface of the river.Apparently, he\u2019d just used it to race across the water\u2019s surface; he wasn\u2019t really walking on water.Even as the crowd relaxed, they were stunned in a different way.Racing across the water on a wooden board still required a powerful cultivation.\u00a0To accomplish such a feat at the Blood Circulation Realm made it obvious just how deep the young man\u2019s foundations were!\u201cSo, it was that wicked disciple!\u201d Zhou Huaiqiu furrowed his brow, and his expression darkened.Ni Hao and Nan Ying recognized him too, and their eyes widened in shock.Mo Tianling!He was once a disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor, but due to his violent, unconstrained temper, he\u2019d once severed a sectmate\u2019s arm in what was supposed to just be a spar. This angered the sect\u2019s higher-ups, and they kicked him out for good.Afterward, he left Cloudriver Prefecture, then joined the Cloudlight Marquis\u2019 Redscale Army. He\u2019d been fighting life-and-death battles on the front lines ever since.None of them would have guessed he\u2019d show up tonight.\u201cSo it was him! The \u2018madman\u2019 of Cloudfall City\u2019s Mo Family!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he join the Redscale Army? Why did he come back all of a sudden?\u201dThe venue burst into discussion once more, but this time, they were discussing Mo Tianling.\u201cWhat powerful murderous intent! It seems he\u2019s killed no small number of people during his time in the Redscale Army\u2026\u201d Fu Shan furrowed his brow.By now, Guangling City\u2019s higher-ups realized that the situation had gotten somewhat complicated.\u00a0The number-one spot ought to have gone to Wen Jueyuan, but Mo Tianling\u2019s sudden arrival threw another variable into the mix!\u201cTianling, don\u2019t waste time! Hurry up and do battle!\u201d shouted Family Head Mo Haolong gravely.\u201cAlthough the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet is awfully dull, my father has spoken. Who am I to refuse?\u201dMo Tianling smiled, then strode onto the stage. Every last spectators\u2019 gaze followed him.\u201cCome on then, I\u2019ll give you a chance to draw your sword. Otherwise, if I attack first, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t even manage that.\u201d Mo Tianling glanced at Wen Jueyuan and laughed gleefully.He stood there lazily, his gaze flippant, as if he were just fooling around.\u00a0Both his posture and his tone were wantonly arrogant.Wen Jueyuan furrowed his brow, but he didn\u2019t lose his temper. On the contrary, his expression was grave. He could sense how terrifying his opponent\u2019s aura was, but this only stimulated his will to fight.Clang!Wen Jueyuan drew his sword, its edge intimidatingly, terrifyingly sharp.\u201cDraw your blade,\u201d said Wen Jueyuan, cold and solemn.\u201cYou\u2019re not worth drawing my blade for.\u201d Mo Tianling shook his head. His tone was casual, as if he were simply stating a fact.This time, Wen Jueyuan couldn\u2019t help but feel his temper flare up.He no longer hesitated. He charged like an arrow loosed from a bow, quick as could be.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!He instantly stabbed twelve times, each stab faster than the one before, flashing with dazzling light and terrifying to behold.The Twelve Light-Chasing Swords.This was\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s last resort, his trump card. He\u2019d already reached the \u201cstepping over the threshold\u201d level. Just a little more, and he\u2019d achieve \u201cproficiency\u201d!\u201cI suppose this is a teensy bit interesting.\u201d Mo Tianling\u2019s lips curved slightly upward.He neither dodged nor retreated, and he looked as composed as ever. When Wen Jueyuan\u2019s sword came swinging towards him, he suddenly shouted, \u201cA single punch is enough to defeat you!\u201dHis aura instantly underwent a dramatic shift. His initial laziness transformed, and he charged with sudden, violent momentum.With a roar, he clenched his right hand and swung his fist.In the eyes of many of the spectators, it was as if Mo Tianling had transformed into a vicious beast, his gaping maw wide open as he lunged at his prey. He was brimming with bloodlust, and the audience\u2019s hearts shook.A piercing \u201cclang\u201d reverberated throughout the stage as fist and sword collided.Wen Jueyuan\u2019s sword went flying out of his hands. Then, he staggered uncontrollably backward.Thud! Thud! Thud!Wen Jueyuan retreated a full nine steps back. His face was pallid, and his chest heaved violently. He couldn\u2019t help but hack up blood.Cough!Blood stained his clothes, the red liquid jarring against the white fabric.One punch!A mere moment ago, everyone in Guangling City thought Wen Jueyuan was sure to take first place, yet now, he\u2019d lost in just one move!His sword was sent flying from hands, and he staggered back nine steps, coughing up blood!The entire venue fell so silent, you could hear a cricket chirp.Over at the banquet site, the VIP guests were dazed. Countless spectators were too stunned to speak.Witnessing the sheer power of that fist was far too great a shock!They practically dared not believe it.Meanwhile, up on stage, Mo Tianling shook his head. \u201cToo weak! Are all the current disciples of Blueriver Sword Manor this useless?\u201dHe then turned and looked around, his gaze deliberately lingering on Zhou Huaiqiu, Ni Hao, and Nan Ying. A blatant, mocking smile tugged at his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Who is Master Su?Zhou Huaiqiu\u2019s eyes surged with sharp light.A cast-out disciple dared publically mock Blueriver Sword Manor before so many people? How impudent was he?Ni Hao and Nan Ying\u2019s expressions were unsightly too.\u00a0Mo Tianling\u2019s words mocked them as well.There was an uproar amongst the prominent guests.Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s name shook all nineteen cities of Cloudriver Prefecture. Their influence was enormous.Yet Mo Tianling was mocking them in front of so many people. Of course the audience was stunned!Suddenly, Cloudfall City Lord Li Jianyu laughed heartily, \u201cTianling is still full of youthful arrogance, and he\u2019s yet to learn to hold his tongue. Brother Zhou, please don\u2019t take offense.\u201dHe paused, and his gaze filled with a strange light. \u201cI won\u2019t keep this from you: since Tianling entered the Redscale Army, he\u2019s repeatedly achieved great military merit.\u201cAnd it\u2019s precisely his unruly temper that won him the Cloudlight Marquis\u2019 favor; he\u2019s already taken Tianling as his adoptive son!\u201dWhen he made this proclamation, everyone in attendance was shocked!The Cloudlight Marquis, Shen Jiusong!In the last hundred years of the Great Zhou Dynasty, only twenty-seven nobles not of the imperial family had received an official title.Their ranks included nine non-Zhou kings and eighteen non-Zhou marquis.All of them were major powers, absolute\u00a0hegemons\u00a0of their respective territories. Each had their own sizable military, ruled an entire region, and possessed immense authority.Of them, the Cloudlight Marquis Shen Jiusong and his Redscale Army were stationed within Gunzhou, the \u201cImperatorial Province\u201d that Cloudriver Prefecture was a part of!Shen Jiusong didn\u2019t just wield immense authority; he himself was an Inner Furnace Realm Grandmaster.And his Redscale Army had a glorious reputation. When the people spoke of them, they said, \u201cEight thousand armored cavalry shake the landscape as Redscale Armor dazzles the world.\u201dBy comparison, Blueriver Sword Manor was but one faction of martial artists in Cloudriver Prefecture. They couldn\u2019t even begin to compare with the armored cavalry of the Redscale Army.For Mo Tianling to be so lucky as to become Shen\u00a0Jiusong\u2019s\u00a0adoptive son was like ascending the heavens in a single bound; his status and position were nothing like before!The crowd only now understood where Mo Tianling got the confidence to mock the Blueriver Sword Manor so openly. Their emotions were instantly in turmoil.Even Zhou Huaiqiu frowned solemnly, but he ultimately remained silent.The Cloudlight Marquis!Blueriver Sword Manor really didn\u2019t dare offend such a lofty, powerful authority figure lightly.Ni Hao furrowed his brow, his expression uncertain.Nan Ying\u2019s beautiful eyes stared intently at Mo Tianling, and she sunk into thought.As for Wen Jueyuan, he\u2019d already admitted defeat and stepped off the stage.Just moments before, he was the man of the hour, the center of attention.\u00a0Yet now, he was nothing but a loser. All he could do was \u2018savor\u2019 the bitter feeling of rising to great heights, only to fall back down to earth.\u201cAnyone else want to play?\u201d Mo Tianling said lazily. He relished the crowd\u2019s shocked, fearful gazes, his expression blatantly frivolous.Although quite a few of the youths presented had planned to participate, none of them dared speak up.Even ignoring Mo Tianling\u2019s status, he\u2019d just defeated the mighty Wen Jueyuan in a single punch. That was enough to shake them deeply. Who would go up on stage just to torture themselves?For a while, everyone looked at each other, the atmosphere silent and stifled.When he saw this, the Cloudfall City Lord Li Jianyu laughed heartily, \u201cBrother Fu, since there are no more challengers, this year\u2019s championship goes to Cloudfall City!\u201dThe people of Cloudfall City were already overcome with excitement and delight.By comparison, many inhabitants of Guangling City wilted like defrosted eggplants, listless and dispirited.\u201cNot so fast!\u201d It was then, before countless confused gazes, that City Lord Fu Shan rose to his feet.He took a deep breath, surveyed his surroundings, and said gravely, \u201cI have no other choice. Master Su, I\u2019ll have to ask you to lend Guangling City a hand!\u201dThis declaration threw the entire venue into uproar.The audience had only just learned that Fu Shan had an ace in the hole too!Except\u2026.Who was this \u201cMaster Su\u201d?Since when did Guangling City have someone City Lord Fu Shan thought so highly of?Everyone was confused, and their gazes scanned the venue.\u201cMaster Su? Which Master Su?\u201d The Cloudfall City Lord, Li Jianyu, felt his heart pound in his chest. He asked coldly, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard this name before?\u201dAmidst the bewildered crowd, a single indifferent voice rang out: \u201cSince City Lord Fu\u2019s invited me onto the stage, I naturally won\u2019t just sit back and do nothing.\u201dThere was a disturbance within the audience.\u00a0Everyone in attendance instantly fixed their gazes toward the source of that voice.The speaker was a youth in jade-colored robes, tall and lean.\u00a0He was none other than Su Yi.\u201cSir, you\u2026.\u201d Hu Quan\u2019s eyes widened. He looked utterly flabbergasted.He was standing right next to Su Yi, so he could naturally tell that Su Yi was the one who\u2019d just spoken.Wen Shaobei was nearby too, and when he saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but chastise him. \u201cSu Yi, City Lord Fu certainly isn\u2019t calling for\u00a0you.\u00a0What are you doing, answering him like some kind of idiot? Are you trying to get yourself killed? If so, feel free, but don\u2019t drag the Wen Family into it!\u201dThis was the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet!Didn\u2019t Su Yi notice that all those Guangling City higher-ups dared not speak up? So why would a waste\u00a0without a cultivation\u00a0stand up? Had he gone absolutely insane?Especially since now, everyone was looking towards them. Those standing near Su Yi felt deeply uncomfortable, and their expressions shifted. They hurriedly distanced themselves from him, as if afraid others might misunderstand.Although Hu Quan didn\u2019t run or hide, his legs quivered, and he broke out into a cold sweat.So many important people were staring right at them! This sensation was simply terrifying!Only Su Yi remained calm. Despite the countless gazes, he was as composed as ever.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Su Yi patted Hu Quan on the shoulder comfortingly. \u201cYou can just wait here.\u201dThen, beneath countless flabbergasted, doubtful, and disbelieving gazes, Su Yi put his hands behind his back and strolled leisurely onto the stage.\u201cHe\u2019s throwing his life away. All of you, ignore him! Remember, he\u2019s not one of us!\u201d Wen Shaobei\u2019s expression was unsightly, and he gnashed his teeth as he gave this command.As Su Yi approached the stage, the crowd parted around him.Everyone looked at him, their expressions strange. Who didn\u2019t recognize the \u201crenowned\u201d live-in son-in-law of Guangling City\u2019s Wen Family?\u00a0Everyone knew he\u2019d long since lost his cultivation!Yet he\u2019d chosen this moment of all times to stand up!\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, he\u2026 Has he gone mad?\u201d Nan Ying looked baffled. She covered her lips, unsure of whether to laugh or cry.Ni Hao was stunned too. He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s just grandstanding like a clown.\u201d\u201cSu Yi\u2026.\u201d Wen Jueyuan\u2019s expression darkened. He\u2019d only just lost, leaving him no dignity to speak of. He was already in a terrible mood.Seeing Su Yi stand up, completely ignorant of his own weakness, Wen Jueyuan felt the urge to murder him.\u00a0What, does that scumbag think the Wen Family hasn\u2019t embarrassed itself enough yet?Li Tianhan and the other Guangling City higher-ups who didn\u2019t know the truth frowned as well. Despite their confusion, they resisted the urge to speak up.As Su Yi neared the stage, Zhou Huaiqiu finally confirmed that this was indeed the Su Yi he knew. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cSu Yi, what are you doing?\u201dSu Yi paused, then said casually, \u201cNaturally, I plan to participate in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition.\u201dZhou Huaiqiu felt increasingly confused, but his keen intuition told him something strange was afoot, so he said no more. He was actually curious to see just what Su Yi was capable of.Beneath the crowd\u2019s stunned, confused gazes, Su Yi strolled onto the stage, instantly becoming the subject of widespread contention.\u201cWhy is it the Wen Family son-in-law?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he lose his cultivation a long time ago?\u201d\u201cNonsense! Is there really no one else in Guangling City? Why are we just watching some cripple take the stage? Are they trying to bring shame upon everyone in Guangling City?\u201dCountless people burst into uproar, like pots blowing their lids.The people watching from the boats filling the Great Azure were frantic, and many of them couldn\u2019t help but curse and shout.Mo Tianling had long since noticed Su Yi, and when he saw that Su Yi really had strode onto the stage, he couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cSu Yi, you lost your entire cultivation, and Blueriver Sword Manor cast you out. Now that I think about it, your experience was somewhat similar to mine. I won\u2019t make this difficult on you, so just hurry up and leave.\u201dMo Tianling sighed and waved him off, his gaze rife with pity.\u00a0He naturally knew of Su Yi\u2019s tragic misfortune, and although he thought Su Yi\u2019s current behavior was ridiculous, he sympathized with him too.But before Su Yi could respond, a burst of mocking laughter resounded throughout the venue.\u201cFu Shan, is\u00a0that\u00a0the \u2018Master Su\u2019 you spoke of?\u201d Cloudfall City Lord Li Jianyu burst into laughter. \u201cAnd here I thought it was some mysterious expert. So, it turns out your \u2018secret ace\u2019 was the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law! Hahaha!\u201dThe rest of Cloudfall City\u2019s higher-ups laughed along with him.A cripple without a cultivation, yet Fu Shan called him \u201cMaster Su\u201d? That alone was an utter farce.Many inhabitants of Guangling City\u2019s expressions became even more unsightly. They were inwardly furious at Su Yi. If looks could kill, who knows how many times Su Yi would have died by now?But against all expectations, Fu Shan said solemnly, \u201cLi Jianyu, who are you to slander Master Su\u2019s brilliance? If you dare say such nonsense again, don\u2019t blame me for casting aside all pretense of courtesy!\u201dThe entire venue fell silent.Aside from Huang Yunchong, Nie Beihu, and the few others in the know, everyone was stunned.\u201cSu Yi really is the \u2018Master Su\u2019 City Lord Fu spoke of?\u201d Everyone was tongue-tied; they almost couldn\u2019t believe their ears.Even Zhou Huaiqiu, with all his years of experience, was baffled.\u00a0What\u2019s going on?Fu Shan is the lord of an entire city. Why does he attach so much importance to a mere youth like Su Yi?Ni Hao and Nan Ying glanced at each other, completely flabbergasted.\u00a0Master Su? He\u2019s the \u2018Master Su\u2019 Fu Shan was talking about?Wen Jueyuan, Wen Shaobei, and the other Wen Family members in attendance felt their eyes practically pop out of their sockets.They understood Su Yi\u2019s plight better than anyone. Watching this play out before them, they didn\u2019t even know how to react.Look at them! Haha!\u00a0Huang Qianjun laughed coldly to himself.Su Yi\u2019s unexpected appearance came as a delightful surprise. Huang Qianjun\u2019s heart coursed with emotion and filled with anticipation.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be interested to see just how capable this \u2018Master Su\u2019 really is!\u201d City Lord Li Jianyu laughed coldly.By now, everyone could tell that the situation was rather strange. Fu Shan seemed completely confident in Su Yi. Something fishy was going on here!\u201c\u2018Master\u2019 Su? Heh heh.\u201d Up on stage, even Mo Tianling was stunned. Then, he snickered, his gaze glinting with sharp, icy light. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re \u2018Master Su\u2019 or not. Are you\u00a0sure\u00a0you won\u2019t leave the stage on your own?\u201dHis aura expanded, becoming incomparably terrifying, every inch of him emanating murderous intent.Su Yi looked him up and down, then said flatly, \u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance to draw your blade. That way, you\u2019ll be convinced of your loss from the bottom of your heart.\u201dHis words were casual, but they made practically everyone\u2019s jaws drop.Just how brazen was this declaration!?Seth's ThoughtsThis chapter specifies that Shen Jiusong is a \u201cnon-Zhou\u201d marquis. A more literal translation would be \u201coutside-surnamed\u201d or \u201cforeign-surnamed.\u201d I will probably use \u201cnon-Zhou\u201d and \u201cforeign-surnamed\u201d interchangeably.The implication is that most of the nobility is at least distantly related to the emperor and that they therefore share his surname. The nobles that don\u2019t share the imperial family\u2019s surname presumably had a higher barrier to entry. The text hasn\u2019t said that, but it seems like a safe assumption.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Su Yi Teaches Martial Arts, the Sparrow-Catching HandDespite himself, Mo Tianling was startled.He\u2019d said almost the exact same thing to Wen Jueyuan just now!\u00a0Both proclamations were wildly arrogant!A moment later, Mo Tianling threw back his head and laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been training in the Redscale Army for over a year, and I\u2019ve long since lost track of how many enemies I\u2019ve killed. I\u2019ve seen plenty of madmen, but never anyone as insane as you!\u201cI\u2019ll be interested to see if you\u2019re even worth drawing my blade for!\u201d\u00a0Before his laughter even finished echoing throughout the arena, Mo Tianling launched himself forward, his bones\u00a0crackling\u00a0like beans in hot oil. In a single breath of time, his blood and qi surged like the tide.Boom!His feet pressed off against the stage with so much force, the iron-wrought stage shook violently. He shot forth, quick as lightning, charging explosively ahead.In mid-air, his right hand closed, as if he were swinging a mountain right at Su Yi.His momentum was fierce and limitlessly domineering!\u201cWhat a sophisticated attack! His punch is like the rumbling of thunder. This is a proficient \u2018Malevolent Celestial Thunder Hand\u2019!\u201d Fu Shan couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, and his pupils constricted.The Malevolent Celestial Thunder Hand was Shen\u00a0Jiusong\u2019s\u00a0ultimate technique. Its wielder punched like a malevolent star with the force of a thunderbolt, powerful and inscrutable.Mo Tianling had actually mastered this ultimate art to proficiency! That was far too terrifying!In Blueriver Sword Manor, only Ni Hao and other top disciples of the inner sect were capable of practicing a martial art to such heights.\u201cThe Cloudlight Marquis\u2019 Malevolent Celestial Thunder Hand!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to smash Su Yi to bits!\u201dExclamations rang out, and many of the major powers were visibly beside themselves.\u201cSir\u2026.\u201d Hu Quan\u2019s heart was on tenterhooks.Everyone else was on edge too. Mo Tianling\u2019s\u00a0momentum\u00a0was far too terrifying, and the example of\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s bitter defeat was still fresh in their memories!But against all expectations, Su Yi just stood there, unmoving. It was only when Mo Tianling drew near that he subtly raised his right arm.His fingers closed around the air, his hand a birdcage!\u00a0A single hand, yet it seemed capable of confining the entirety of both heaven and earth.His calm detachment quietly transformed.Bang!The stage rumbled.The crowd felt as if they were hallucinating; Mo Tianling stopped, mid-charge, then retreated a full ten feet back. Only then did he manage to stabilize himself.\u201cNo wonder you dared provoke me the moment you stepped on stage. So, you\u2019ve recovered your cultivation!\u201d Mo Tianling\u2019s eyes glinted with sharp light. Despite his surprise, everything suddenly seemed clearer.Meanwhile, the entire venue was in uproar.Su Yi!Everyone in Guangling City knew he was a live-in son-in-law, a cripple without a cultivation, a disciple cast out of Blueriver Sword Manor. But although none of them knew it, he\u2019d shockingly recovered his cultivation!This was truly far too shocking!\u201cHow is this possible!?\u201d This revelation dealt Nan Ying an enormous shock, and her pretty face contorted. Her beautiful eyes bulged.It was precisely because Su Yi had lost his cultivation that she\u2019d turned on him without hesitation, choosing to find another path to reach her goals.Who would have thought that just one year later, the man she\u2019d disdained as a waste and ruthlessly kicked to the curb would recover?The shock threw her off balance, and she could no longer control herself.\u201cIt really is unexpected\u2026\u201d Ni Hao was surprised too, but he was far calmer by comparison.Back when Su Yi was still a Blueriver Sword Manor disciple, he was just in the Refining Sinew stage. Even though he\u2019d recovered, he was still unworthy of Ni Hao\u2019s notice.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Wen Changqing had been silent and sullen this entire time, but now, he couldn\u2019t help but stare. He was visibly shocked, and his expression shifted erratically.\u00a0That damned bastard! He sure hid himself awfully deep!Wen Jueyuan, Wen Shaobei, and the other Wen Family youths reacted as if they\u2019d seen a ghost; they just stood there, dazed.\u00a0All of them were wondering the same thing:\u00a0When the hell did Su Yi recover his cultivation?\u201cHmph. No wonder you\u2019re so brazen,\u201d said Li Tianhan, his gaze sinister. \u201cIt turns out you\u2019ve regained everything you lost.\u201dA cripple wasn\u2019t worth a second thought.But when a cripple regained his cultivation and became a martial artist again, that was an entirely different story.Li Tianhan furrowed his brow. When he recalled that his son, Li Moyun, was planning to murder Su Yi this very night, he fell silent.\u201cThat boy sure knows how to keep his cool.\u201d Zhou Huaiqiu looked gratified, and his eyes flashed with delight. However, his heart churned. He suddenly regretted not paying Su Yi a visit after arriving in Guangling City.Could it be that he chose not to tell me he\u2019d regained his cultivation precisely because I treated him so distantly?\u00a0When this possibility occurred to him, Zhou Huaiqiu\u2019s delight receded, and he felt internally conflicted.\u201cSo, our family\u2019s son-in-law became a martial artist again\u2026.!\u201d Hu Quan was beside himself with joy.Of those present, only Fu Shan, Huang Yunchong, Nie Beihu, Nie Teng, and Huang Qianjun remained relatively calm.This was because they\u2019d long since known of Su Yi\u2019s recovery, and they understood his abilities far better than the rest of the audience.The venue practically boiled over, especially on Guangling City\u2019s side. They were in uproar!Even Cloudfall City\u2019s side was stunned beyond belief; a live-in son-in-law, someone universally regarded as a mere cripple, yet he\u2019d managed such a counter-attack? This was undoubtedly a huge shock.Suddenly, Li Tianyu snorted coldly and roared, \u201cSo what if he regained his cultivation? Back when he was still the Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect Sword Chief, his cultivation was inferior to even\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s!\u201dThis one sentence suppressed much of the discussion, and the atmosphere calmed down significantly.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Mo Tianling beat Wen Jueyuan with a single punch. Even if Su\u00a0Yi\u2019s recovered\u00a0his cultivation, what of it?\u201d Nan Ying muttered to herself. She\u2019d lost control over her emotions earlier, but this thought made her much calmer.The others gradually reacted as well and suppressed their turbulent emotions. They gazed back at the stage.It was just, when they looked at the newly-recovered Su Yi, their attitude had silently undergone a subtle shift.\u201cThis is actually a good thing,\u201d said Mo Tianling. He\u2019d already calmed down, and he laughed, \u201cThis way, when I beat you, no one will mock me for bullying a pathetic worm with no cultivation.\u201dSu Yi remained calm from beginning to end.He ignored Mo Tianling\u2019s provocations. Instead, he glanced over at Nie Teng, who was now seated beside his father at the banquet, then said, \u201cWatch carefully.\u201dNie Teng was briefly stunned. His face filled with confusion; he didn\u2019t get what Su Yi was trying to say.Boom!Mo Tianling seized the opportunity to attack once more.\u00a0He shot through the air with fiendish momentum, charging like lightning, fast and despotic. This was a true killing art, tempered on the battlefield. His bloodlust was terrifying.Wen Jueyuan held his breath. He had a sudden, powerful premonition\u00a0that were he\u00a0the\u00a0one facing this attack, he\u2019d\u00a0suffer\u00a0grievous injuries, and that\u2019s assuming he even made it out alive!Offstage, the audience could sense that Mo Tianling was really attacking with the intent to kill. He\u2019d gone all out, and his earlier flippant attitude was nowhere to be seen.But Su Yi merely stretched, his hands closing around air, floating like clouds and flowing like water, without the slightest urgency.When\u00a0Mo Tianling\u2019s\u00a0fist came crashing towards him, as powerful and despotic as it was, something silently diverted its course. His attack didn\u2019t so much as touch Su Yi\u2019s clothes.The most unbelievable part was that Su Yi\u2019s movements weren\u2019t quick; his hands were like drifting clouds or unfurling scrolls, yet they had a certain mysterious and inexplicable cadence.\u201cAchieving maximum results with minimum effort? Diverting a tree with a flower?\u201d Mo Tianling\u2019s expression shifted. This was a martial arts trick, and it wasn\u2019t difficult.But in Su Yi\u2019s hands, it seemed invincible, without the slightest gap or weakness.Boom!Mo Tianling\u2019s eyes glinted with sharp light. He swung his fist with the intent to kill.He\u2019d fought in the Redscale Army for over a year to refine his Malevolent Celestial Thunder Hand. He\u2019d lost track of how many vicious foes he\u2019d overcome on the blood-soaked battlefield or how long he\u2019d immersed himself in martial arts to achieve proficiency in this technique.When he exploded with his full power, he was as mighty as a tiger or leopard, and his\u00a0fist\u00a0struck like lightning. He was like a human weapon, imposing and overbearing.But what made Mo Tianling\u2019s expression change was\u2014Every time he attacked, Su Yi easily shifted its course, leaving him both infuriated and stifled.From the perspective of the audience, Mo Tianling attacked like a storm, coming at Su Yi from all sides.Su Yi, conversely, was like a boulder. No matter how hard the wind blew, he stood there, unmoving. That mad flurry of attacks didn\u2019t so much as touch his clothes.This drew sidelong glances from the entire venue.\u00a0Some of the major powers in attendance were stunned, and their eyes widened in disbelief.But Nie Beihu and Nie Teng were the most agitated of all.They could tell that the martial art Su Yi currently had on display was the one they were the most proficient in, the \u201cSparrow-Catching Hand\u201d!However, when they used the Sparrow-Catching Hand, using their palms as a formless cage, they could at most prevent birds from flying away.Nie Beihu had been immersed in the study of martial arts for years. His exquisite control might perhaps entrap an entire flock of birds within a given range of his hands.But watching Su Yi, he realized he paled by comparison.In Su Yi\u2019s hands, this familiar martial art exploded with unimaginable power.\u00a0He was like an immortal going through the stances of his technique.Every living thing was a \u201csparrow\u201d, while all of heaven and earth were a \u201ccage\u201d!Nie Teng watched, dazed, unable to look away. The sight shook his heart repeatedly.He\u2019d been studying this very art for years, but he\u2019d only just realized it could unleash such unbelievable power!He dared not look away. He held his breath and watched with rapt attention, carefully observing every move.Ol\u2019 Nie\u2019s son has finally won Master Su\u2019s favor. How rare and fortunate!\u00a0Fu Shan sighed to himself.There was no way he\u2019d miss that Su Yi was using this duel as an opportunity to teach Nie Teng the Sparrow-Catching Hand\u2019s profundities!Huang Qianjun\u2019s expression shifted too. Just like Fu Shan, he could see through Su Yi\u2019s intentions.This was a stroke of fortune!Meanwhile, everyone present could tell that Mo Tianling\u2019s situation left little room for optimism.In Su Yi\u2019s hands, he was like a caged beast. With every movement of Su Yi\u2019s palms, a formless cage entrapped him, and despite his attempts to charge through, he couldn\u2019t break free.This unbelievable scene drew countless gasps and exclamations.Before, most of those present were certain that, even if Su Yi had recovered his cultivation, there was no way he\u2019d be a match for a madman like Mo Tianling.But now, their convictions wavered.Especially Nan Ying, Ni Hao, Wen Jueyuan, and Wen Shaobei. Their emotions rose and fell in waves, their expressions flitting back and forth unpredictably. It was a spectacular sight!Someone they\u2019d once degraded, disdained, ignored, and looked down on was now revealing power far beyond their imagination. How could they accept this so suddenly?\u201cBreak!\u201d Up on the platform, Mo Tianling was as grim and somber as could be. He suddenly roared, and all the energy in his body flowed into his right fist, like floodwaters bursting through a dam.He swung his fist. This punch was as fast as lightning, and it rumbled like thunder, ripping the very air itself asunder. The power of a peak Blood Circulation Realm expert was on full display.\u201cFine then. Allow me to show you the true meaning of \u2018martial arts\u2019!\u201d Su Yi sighed, and his hands pressed gently against the air. His movements were light and ethereal, without any force at all.Yet Mo Tianling\u2019s expression shifted dramatically. He felt as if Su Yi\u2019s hands carried an enormous cage, as if the weight of all of creation were bearing down on him.In the face of this cage formed of heaven and earth, he felt utterly minuscule and helpless.He couldn\u2019t run, nor could he dodge!Seth's ThoughtsThe Nie Family\u2019s technique, \u63fd\u96c0\u4e4b\u624b, the Sparrow-Catching Hand, is likely named after \u63fd\u96c0\u5c3e, or \u201cgrasping the sparrow\u2019s tail\u201d, a Tai-chi movement.Nckeo posted some more information about it, so scroll down if you're interested! Sounds like there was a scandal involving this technique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Widespread Shock, Solitary MelancholyThis is bad!\u00a0Mo Tianling was instantly alarmed. He could sense the life-threatening danger rushing right towards him. He felt his heart sink into despair, as if he were on the verge of drowning.He\u2019d fought and killed on the battlefield for over a year, an incomparably brutal tempering.But this was the first time he\u2019d felt so close to death. He\u2019d never been so terrified in his life!\uff01His will to fight instantly shattered, and he sank into despair.Struggle?Resist?Fight with everything we had?All of these ideas shattered into pieces. His mind went entirely blank.Meanwhile, beneath countless gazes, an unbelievable scene played out.The spectators watched as Mo Tianling just stood there, as if his soul had left his body.And Su Yi? His gently pressing hands suddenly clenched and shifted positions.Boom!The air shook, rumbling like thunder.The entire iron-wrought stage trembled, stirring up shrieking gales. Mo Tianling\u2019s long hair billowed, and his clothes fluttered in the wind.\u201cWhat level of martial art is that?\u201dThe entire venue fell silent. The higher-ups of both participating cities couldn\u2019t help but gasp.Mo Tianling\u2019s Malevolent Celestial Thunder Hand was the Cloudlight Marquis\u2019 long-famed ultimate skill, a top-class killing technique.But Su Yi\u2019s martial art was like straight-up immortal magic!His attack seemed light and ethereal, yet it resembled a falling skyscraper or the dome of heaven falling to earth. It shook the hearts of all who witnessed it.\u201cHow is this possible\u2026.\u201d Hidden within her sleeves, Nan Ying\u2019s pale fists clenched so hard that her veins\u00a0bulged.She stared intently at the youth in jade robes, the man with the bearing of a deity. Tidal waves surged through her heart, and she felt an indescribable, inexplicable resentment.\u00a0She was on the verge of losing control completely.By now, who couldn\u2019t tell that Su Yi had more than just \u201crecovered\u201d his former cultivation? His attainments in the Martial Dao were now strong enough to suppress even Mo Tianling!This revelation was simply shocking!\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you defeat me in a single attack?\u201d\u00a0Mo Tianling had already regained his senses. His face was pallid, and there was a hint of lingering terror in his expression. More than that, there was resentment and bitterness.\u201cI said I\u2019d give you the chance to draw your saber. Had I suppressed you right off the bat, wouldn\u2019t it seem like I didn\u2019t keep my word?\u201d said Su Yi flatly.Mo Tianling was stunned.\u00a0It was just to give me a chance to draw my blade?Su Yi\u2019s words were a deep affront to his dignity. His expression soured, becoming unsightly, and his eyes blazed with viciousness and fury.\u201cI can admit defeat, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll accept this kind of humiliation!\u201d said Mo Tianling icily.He drew his saber.Clang!The deep purple of its blade had an eerie, radiant luster. Against the darkness and beneath the lantern\u2019s glow, it flashed with a chilling, bloodthirsty light.A purple saber!The Cloudlight Marquis had given him this weapon personally in hopes that Mo Tianling would use it to slaughter countless enemies in battle and achieve matchless meritorious deeds.Mo Tianling had disdained to draw his blade even against Wen Jueyuan.With his saber in hand, Mo Tianling\u2019s demeanor changed. He was fierce and domineering as flame, as sharp-edged as frost.\u00a0This scene drew the countless spectators\u2019 attention, stunning each and every one of them.\u201cSo, his real trump card was the Dao of the Saber\u2026.\u201d Wen Jueyuan\u2019s eyes were lifeless, and his face was ashen.Thud! Thud! Thud!Mo Tianling strode across the stage, each step like a heaven-shaking drum.He raised his purple saber into the air. It lit up with eerie, radiant light as he swung in fury.The Blood-Drinking Slash!Years ago, this very attack had made the Cloudlight Marquis nigh-invincible on the battlefield. It was the reason his enemies paled and fled at the very mention of his name.When Mo Tianling used it, he lacked the monstrous power of the Grandmaster Realm, but he retained a portion of the slash\u2019s essence.The edge struck like lightning, its radiance unearthly. The air split beneath this vicious swing, stirring up high-pitched, howling winds.Who knew how many people felt chills course down their spines when they saw this attack?But Su Yi merely furrowed his brow, a hint of disappointment flickering across his face.He sighed, and his tall, lean frame finally took action.Clothes fluttering, he stood as graceful as a crane in cold water, with a detached, ethereal charm.He raised the fingers of his right hand, avoiding the layers of unearthly saber light by a hair, and gently tapped Mo Tianling\u2019s blade.\u00a0His movements were casual and understated.Clang!The sound of the resulting collision stung the eardrums. Mo Tianling froze in place, as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning, quivering violently from head to toe.The purple saber shook and buzzed in his hand, then flew from his grip.The Blood-Drinking Slash was Mo Tianling\u2019s secret weapon, his ultimate killing technique, yet Su Yi had shattered it with a casual tap of his fingers!Thud!The purple saber crashed onto the stage, shocking the startled spectators out of their reverie.Without exception, their expressions shifted dramatically.A single finger had determined victory and defeat. Terrifying!\u201cYou rely on gambits, prioritizing tricks over \u2018momentum.\u2019 You\u2019ve gone down the wrong path and cut off your future growth.\u201d Su Yi shook his head.And here he\u2019d thought that someone like Mo Tianling ought to have at least some attainments in the Dao of the Saber.But against all expectations, one swing was enough to tell Su Yi that his opponent had lost his way. His Dao wasn\u2019t even worth looking at.Mo Tianling stood there, stunned, as if he\u2019d lost his soul. Finally, he said bitterly, \u201cWhat martial art did you just use?\u201dHe was dazed; this whole fight was like a bad dream. He couldn\u2019t even tell just how strong his opponent was.\u201cA petty skill, not even worth mentioning,\u201d said Su Yi lightly.All he\u2019d done was see through his opponent\u2019s attack and break it. He\u2019d relied on his keen eyes, power, and temperament. He hadn\u2019t used some \u201cexquisite martial art\u201d or anything like that.\u201cA petty skill\u2026.\u201d Mo Tiangling muttered to himself, and his spirits sank. \u201cI lost\u2026.\u201dHis eyes were lifeless and black, and he seemed to wither as he walked off the stage.Just like that, Mo Tianling, the adoptive son of the Cloudlight Marquis, lost!Su Yi remained on stage, his hands behind his back. He said flatly, \u201cDoes anyone else wish to compete?\u201dThe entire venue fell silent!Regardless of whether they hailed from Guangling or Cloudfall City, no one dared accept this challenge.Mere minutes had passed between Su Yi taking the stage and Mo Tianying slinking off in abject defeat. This overturned countless spectators\u2019 perceptions of reality!Who could ever have imagined that the cast-off disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor, the Wen Family live-in son-in-law everyone mocked, would emerge as the uncontested victor of the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet just one year later?The most shocking part was how calm and composed Su Yi seemed; suppressing Mo Tianyun seemed almost effortless. This, more than anything, shocked everything present.Wen Jueyuan looked as if he were attending his parents\u2019 funeral.He was the leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation, a rare prodigy\u00a0of the Martial\u00a0Dao, someone everyone in Guangling City thought had a real chance of taking home the championship.In the past, he paid Su Yi no heed at all. He\u2019d always ignored him, and when he did notice him, he treated him with disdain.But today, Mo Tianling beat him in a single punch!That alone was no small shock, but Mo Tianling was once an inner sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor, and he was now the adoptive son of the Cloudlight Marquis. Losing to someone like him still\u00a0hurt, but Wen Jueyuan could accept it.But when he saw Su Yi easily defeat Mo Tianling, Wen Jueyuan\u2019s mental state collapsed. He sank into a furious, bewildered daze, unable to extricate himself. He couldn\u2019t accept that Su Yi, the person he\u2019d once disdained, was so far above him!Wen Shaobei and the other Wen Family youths were flabbergasted too.They\u2019d only just realized how ridiculous they must have seemed to Su Yi, like a pack of silly little clowns\u2026\u201cThat bastard! He\u2019s been pulling the wool over our eyes this entire time!\u201d Wen Changqing gnashed his teeth. It seemed he\u2019d finally understood something, and his expression turned terrifying and sinister.Li Tianhan\u2019s heart sank. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder,\u00a0If Moyun were here, could he defeat Su Yi?\u201cSigh.\u201d Zhou Huaiqiu was excited but also vexed. His heart was in turmoil.Su Yi\u2019s performance was an indescribable delight, but when he recalled the way Blueriver Sword Manor cast Su Yi out and how distant he\u2019d been upon finding out that Su Yi had become a live-in son-in-law, his heart filled with regret.All he could do now was grimace.Hu Quan\u2019s jaw dropped, unable to believe it.Huang Qianjun and Nie Teng\u2019s hearts surged with emotions, their gazes shocked and reverent.Nan Ying\u2019s expression shifted back and forth, her heart filled with resentment as well as regret.She resented that Su Yi had climbed back up to prominence after falling into the dust!And she regretted cutting Su Yi off so completely after learning of his lost cultivation. She should have at least left some thread of their former bond intact. That way, they might still be able to reconcile\u2026Although she didn\u2019t realize it, Ni Hao had been watching her this whole time, and his expression grew steadily darker. His heart surged with limitless anger.Huang Yunchong and Nie Beihu looked at each other. They could clearly see the shock written in each other\u2019s eyes.But soon, they couldn\u2019t help but laugh.When Su Yi appeared on stage, they knew they could relax.\u00a0They just hadn\u2019t anticipated that he\u2019d win so beautifully. They were both Qi Accumulation Realm experts, but even they couldn\u2019t help but sigh with admiration.Furthermore, they were completely certain that after tonight\u2019s banquet, Su Yi\u2019s name would shake both sides of the Great Azure!Fu Shan held his head up high, and he could no longer hold back laughter, the sound breaking the silence following Su Yi\u2019s victory.\u00a0\u201cLi Jianyu, unless you have someone else lined up to fight, Spiritbamboo Island shall belong to my Guangling City for the next ten years!\u201dHis words spread throughout the arena.Li Jianyu\u2019s expression darkened, and his heart surged with intense bitterness.Mo Tianling was his trump card.Who would have thought his ace in the hole would lose to the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law everyone in Guangling City disregarded?When he heard Fu Shan\u2019s laughter, he felt so stifled that he almost coughed up blood.When he looked at the other Cloudfall City higher-ups, their expressions were unsightly.Meanwhile, Su Yi remained up on the platform, hands behind his back, his expression flat and indifferent, with no sign of any emotion at all.To the others in attendance, beating Mo Tianling was an incomparably dazzling result.But in his eyes, he\u2019d merely overpowered a tiny little Blood Circulation Realm youth. What did that amount to?If Fu Shan hadn\u2019t specifically requested his aid, he wouldn\u2019t have even bothered participating.If Lingxue were here, we could go boating together on the Great Azure. Admiring the flames of countless lanterns reflecting against the water would be far more interesting than attending a banquet like that.She\u2019s likely already seen her sister by now. I just don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll come back\u2026.Standing on the hundred-foot Dragon\u2019s Gate Arena, Su Yi gazed at the resplendent lights illuminating the Great Azure. He suddenly recalled that pure-hearted, bright, beautiful, lively little sister-in-law of his.Suddenly, he felt a thread of melancholy rise within his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - The Second Day of the Second Lunar Month, the Dragon Raises its HeadA long time passed, but no one dared take the stage.Finally, Su Yi waited no longer. Hands behind his back, he walked offstage.The crowd\u2019s gaze followed him, their expressions stunned, bewildered, or dazed\u2026.This was a vivid microcosm of the countless facets of human life.\u201cMaster Su, please take a seat!\u201d Fu Shan took the initiative to welcome him, a respectful look on his face.\u201cSo the empty seat beside Fu Shan was reserved for Su Yi!\u201d One of the major powers suddenly realized what was happening. Everything made sense now.The others then understood too, but this only made their expressions even more complicated.It was just an empty chair, but from it, it was clear just how highly Fu Shan valued Su Yi.\u201cNo need. This matter has been resolved, so I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d Su Yi shook his head and refused.He\u2019d never liked this type of noisy, crowded atmosphere anyway.Fu Shan dared not attempt to persuade him. Instead, he ordered, \u201cAttendants, escort Master Su back.\u201d\u201cCity Lord Fu, please, allow me.\u201d Huang Qianjun was nearby. He shot to his feet and immediately walked over.Nie Teng hesitated, then did the same.When he saw this, Nie Beihu felt deeply gratified.His son had always been prideful, but this showed that Su Yi\u2019s earlier display was enough to convince him.Su Yi said no more. He just walked directly out of the venue.Huang Qianjun and Nie Teng followed hot on his heels.When they saw this, waves surged through the gathered higher-ups\u2019 hearts once more.Huang Qianjun was the son and heir of Family Head Huang Yunchong, while Nie Teng was the son of the commander of the guards, Nie Beihu.Yet now, both of them were acting like mere attendants, tagging after Su Yi of their own volition. This meant something completely different!This is bad!\u00a0When he saw this, Li Tianhan suddenly recalled something. His heart clenched, and his expression shifted.Back at the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet, Fu Shan, Nie Beihu, and Huang Yunchong had argued against dissolving Su Yi\u2019s marriage, even though it meant opposing the Li Family.Li Tianhan and his son had assumed this was because of Wen Lingzhao, the \u201cGrandmaster\u2019s disciple.\u201d They thought that was the only possible reason such influential characters would stand with the Wen Family.But now it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case at all!\u201cBut why does Fu Shan attach such enormous importance to Su Yi?\u201d Li Tianhan\u2019s expression was uncertain, his heart heavy.He was well aware that as impressive as Su Yi\u2019s performance was, he was still just a Blood Circulation Realm youth; that level of strength was nowhere near enough to make old foxes like Fu Shan and Huang Yunchong treat him with such reverence.This meant that Su Yi had some other secret, something he still didn\u2019t know about!And it was this secret, whatever it was, that explained Fu Shan\u2019s respect for Su Yi!Li Tianhan dared not delay any father. He immediately whispered an order to the elderly attendant beside him.The elderly retainer immediately scurried off.As he watched Su Yi fade into the distance, Zhou Huaiqiu sighed. He hesitated, but in the end, he didn\u2019t chase after him.He had a certain premonition that even if he threw away all his dignity and begged Su Yi to return to the Blueriver Sword Manor, Su Yi wouldn\u2019t agree.Still, he couldn\u2019t help but find it a pity, and he couldn\u2019t help but regret.\u00a0When he first fell back into the mortal dust, no one concerned themselves with his\u00a0wellbeing. Even I distanced myself from him.Today, he\u2019s returned to the Martial Dao, revealing even more dazzling brilliance than before. How could he possibly return to Blueriver Sword Manor, the place that once hurt him so badly?But enough. There\u2019s nothing for it.\u00a0Zhou Huaiqiu took a deep breath, then suppressed the regret welling within his heart.\u201cJunior Apprentice Sister Nan Ying, it seems you\u2019re awfully reluctant to see Su Yi leave,\u201d said Ni Hao coldly. Seeing Nan Ying\u2019s dazed stupor, he couldn\u2019t help but get angry.Nan Ying jumped, and her expression shifted dramatically. Finally, she let out a gentle sigh, sounding aggrieved.\u00a0\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Ni, you know that Su Yi and I accompanied each other for three years. I thought our paths would never cross again. Who could have anticipated everything we saw tonight?\u201dThe more she spoke, the darker Ni Hao\u2019s expression. Her words only fanned the flames of jealousy in his heart.Nan Ying had obviously realized this, so she changed tacks. \u201cBut Senior Apprentice Brother Ni, you have an eternal, irreplaceable place in my heart. Besides, if I really still had lingering feelings for Su Yi, how could I have gone a full year without so much as asking about him?She leaned her head against Ni Hao\u2019s broad shoulders and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m actually happy to see you this angry. It proves that you care for me.\u201dNi Hao\u2019s expression instantly softened. He took in her delicate fragrance, and when he spoke, his tone was far gentler. \u201cJunior Apprentice Sister, just now, I got a bit overly excited.\u201dNan Ying stretched out her jade-like hand and hooked it around Ni Hao\u2019s arm. She whispered honeyed words, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, don\u2019t explain. I understand.\u201dBut in her heart, she was wondering\u2014Should I go see Su Yi before we leave Guangling City?\u201cCousin, that Su Yi is simply despicable! He\u2019s been hiding his cultivation all this time! He\u2019s been\u00a0playing the\u00a0entire family all year!\u201d Wen Shaobei was righteously indignant, but he only dared whisper his complaints next to Wen Jueyuan.\u201cHe never lied to us. We\u2019ve just overlooked him,\u201d said Wen Jueyuan dejectedly.Tonight was supposed to be his chance in the spotlight, the day he spread his reputation far and wide.But the world was unpredictable. Who would have guessed that he\u2019d end up the Dragon Gate Banquet's most ridiculous loser?He\u2019d become a stepping stone for Su Yi!\u201cCousin, don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re just going to let this go?\u201d said Wen Shaobei unwillingly.\u201cDo\u00a0you\u00a0want to fight him?\u201d Wen Jueyuan said coldly, staring at Wen Shaobei as if he were an idiot. \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand? Su Yi didn\u2019t just recover his cultivation; even the city lord attaches enormous importance to him now! From this day forth, he\u2019s no longer that pitiful worm the Wen Family can trample as it pleases!He practically spat these words, his tone revealing his bitterness, fury, dejection, and unwillingness.Despite having been insulted so viciously, Wen Shaobei could only lower his head.\u201cLi Jianyu, have you prepared the champion\u2019s prizes?\u201d Fu Shan beamed.The victor was to receive a thousand taels of gold, three stalks of spiritual medicine, ten clusters of pearls, and a peak yellow-grade martial art tome!This was a highly enticing reward.Everyone at the banquet turned to look at Li Jianyu.Li Jianyu froze, then snorted, \u201cA paltry reward like that? There\u2019s no need to remind me. I\u2019ll have someone deliver them tomorrow morning.\u201dHe\u2019d come to the banquet assuming that with Mo Tianling, they had this in the bag. As such, he had yet to prepare the prizes.But Su Yi\u2019s arrival had shattered all his schemes. He hadn\u2019t just lost Spiritbamboo Island; now he had to start figuring out where he\u2019d come up with all that treasure\u2026.If he said he wasn\u2019t furious, he\u2019d definitely be lying.\u201cDon\u2019t forget about Spiritbamboo Island. Starting today, it\u2019s under the jurisdiction of Guangling City and the city lord\u2019s estate. If I discover anyone unauthorized on or near the island, I\u2019ll have them killed on sight!\u201d Although Fu Shan laughed as he said this, his words were murderous.\u201cHmph!\u201d Li Jianyu couldn\u2019t remain seated any longer. He rose, swished his sleeves, then stormed off.If he stayed any longer, he\u2019d die of anger!The Cloudfall City higher-ups rose and followed him out almost immediately after.In stark contrast, the atmosphere on Guangling City\u2019s side heated up. Everyone laughed and chatted amongst themselves, drinking in celebration.After all, Su Yi had represented Guangling City in taking the championship. This cast the city higher-ups in a good light too.They graciously pretended to ignore the losers as they slunk away before the festivities ended.The night sky hung over the waters of the Great Azure. Thousands of sails fluttered in the wind, and the countless lanterns were like dragons.News of Su Yi taking the number one spot in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet spread across both sides of the river at shocking speeds. Before long, the ordinary citizens of both cities were all in the know.Before long, the sound of uproar filled the air, echoing throughout the night sky.\u2026\u2026The city gates.\u201cYou two should go back. No need to accompany me any further,\u201d said Su Yi, pausing to look at Huang Qianjun and Nie Teng.Huang Qianjun nodded and smiled; he knew better than to push.Nie Teng hesitated, then bowed to Su Yi. \u201cBrother Su, thank you for enlightening me! I\u2019ll remember this kindness for the rest of my life!\u201dThe way Su Yi used his duel with Mo Tianling to demonstrate the Sparrow-Catching Hand helped Nie Teng finally realize the true essence and charm of his own martial art.Facing Su Yi now, he felt awed and reverential.\u201cRemember what you said back then.\u201d Su Yi nodded, then turned and walked through the gates.\u201cWhat I said back then\u2026.\u201d Nie Teng\u2019s heart shook. Then, he took a deep breath. Su Yi was already far away, but Nie Teng nevertheless faced him and clasped his fist. \u201cBrother Su, don\u2019t worry. I, Nie Teng, will never forget!\u201d\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cNone of your business.\u201d Nie Teng turned and left.Huang Qianjun hurried after him. \u201cOl\u2019 Brother Nie, wait for me! Come on; we\u2019re both on Brother Su\u2019s side, so we should get to know each other better! How about we go to one of those flower boats and have ourselves a good time? I know just the girl. She\u2019s famous for her wit and singing voice, and she\u2019s a master of every type of instrument. In Guangling City, she\u2019s\u2026.\u201dThe two of them gradually faded into the distance.Meanwhile, Su Yi strolled leisurely through the city\u2019s empty streets.The vast majority of the city\u2019s inhabitants had gone to watch the festivities. The streets were normally bustling with activity, but today, they were all but abandoned. The lights were out, and the doors were closed.From time to time, he saw scattered groups returning from beyond the gates, all of them animatedly discussing the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet and the results of the competition.But even as they passed Su Yi, none of them recognized the very youth who\u2019d just easily taken home the championship.When Su Yi reached the Apricot Clinic, he turned and looked up at the night sky.The moon was bright, but the stars were sparse, the pale clouds soft as cotton.Even from a distance, he could dimly discern the sound of revelry. In the solitary darkness of the night, it sounded fleeting and ethereal.\u201cWhen does the turmoil of human affairs end? It\u2019s only after the bustling streets quiet down that everything seems the most authentic.\u201d Su Yi muttered to himself, then returned to the Apricot Cottage. His lean figure seemed solitary and detached.This was the 399th year of the Zhou Dynasty\u2019s history, the second day of the second month of the lunar calendar, as well as the second month of spring.This was the day insects awoke from hibernation, a day of universal rebirth.Were you to study the stars, you\u2019d discover that of the twenty-eight celestial mansions, the first of the seven comprising the azure dragon revealed itself in the east, but the rest of the dragon\u2019s \u201cbody\u201d was still submerged in the darkness.As such, today was known as \u201cthe day the dragon raises its head.\u201dOn this day, one year after losing his cultivation and marrying into the Wen Family, Su Yi stepped into the Dragon\u2019s Gate Arena, his skill shocking the entire audience. He became the center of attention.The people were in uproar.But although almost no one knew it\u2014In this lifetime, today was Su Yi\u2019s birthday too.And it was on this very day that his current incarnation\u2019s mother, Ye Yufei,\u00a0fell\u00a0sick and passed away.At the time, he was only four years old, and she left him all alone.Seth's ThoughtsThis chapter heavily references the Chinese Lunar Calendar and\u00a0traditional Chinese constellations. I think Wikipedia will do a better job explaining than I will, but basically, the night sky is divided into four directions, which are each divided into seven constellations called\u00a0\u201cmansions\u201d. The four directions are associated with the\u00a0four symbols, and the azure dragon is associated with the east.The dragon referred to here is, therefore, not a constellation. It\u2019s a grouping of constellations.\u00a0The \u201chorn\u201d is a distinct constellation.\u00a0Those same stars are considered part of \u201cvirgo\u201d in the Western tradition.The\u00a0dragon raising its head\u00a0is a real traditional festival, and although this is not directly stated, it is likely the reason the two cities chose to hold the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet tonight of all nights.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - My FateAs soon as Su Yi entered the courtyard, the red-clad Qing Wan floated out of his room.\u201cMystic Master, while you were out of the house, a large group of people hid outside the courtyard, all of them armed and ready for battle. They all radiated dense bloodlust; it was terrifying!\u201d Her fair features revealed lingering shock and terror. She looked tense as could be; she\u2019d clearly been scared senseless.\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Su Yi narrowed his eyes.Qing Wan stuck out her tongue, then said with an air of celebration, \u201cUh\u2026. I don\u2019t know why, but they left already.\u201dSu Yi furrowed his brow. \u201cCome inside, then tell me what happened in more detail.\u201d He then walked in ahead of her.\u201cOh! Okay.\u201d Qing Wan hurried after him.Who knew why, but after Su Yi returned to the courtyard, she felt much calmer, as if she\u2019d found her rock.Although she was still meek, timid, and reverent whenever she faced Su Yi, having him around was still better than being scared on her own.Soon, a lamp illuminated the room, dispelling the darkness and bringing them warmth.Qing Wan hovered not far from Su Yi, wincing. Her snowy white feet were bare, and her delicate little toes clenched and unclenched repeatedly.\u201cWhy are you so nervous?\u201d When he saw her acting like this, Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brow.Qing Wan hurriedly shook her head. \u201cMystic Master, I\u2019m not nervous.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Su Yi took a seat. His gaze traveled from her jade-like legs and up to her picturesquely beautiful face. \u201cWhen you\u2019re nervous, you clench your toes, your eyelashes quiver, your hands clench and unclench in front of you, and you subconsciously fidget with your clothes.\u201dQing Wan froze. Her rosy cheeks burned bright red; she felt as if he\u2019d seen through her completely and revealed all of her secrets, as if there was nowhere left to hide.This only made her even more nervous. Hidden beneath her long hair, the tips of her perfectly-formed little ears turned bright red.\u201cCowardly, bashful, nervous\u2026. Where did Wu Ruoqiu found a yin soul like this?\u201d Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but rub his forehead.\u00a0Then, he changed tacks completely. \u201cTell me about the people lying in ambush here.\u201dQing Wan instantly sighed in relief. She pondered a moment, then said, \u201cI was hiding in the old locust tree, and I heard part of their conversation.\u201dIn her soft, sticky voice, she recounted the night\u2019s events from beginning to end.\u00a0When she finished her tale, Su Yi\u2019s brow shot up, and he gently drummed his fingers against the table. He stared intently at the candlelight, lost in thought.According to Qing Wan, the group\u00a0laying\u00a0in ambush were from the Li Family!Furthermore, they\u2019d come at Li Moyun\u2019s orders, and they were waiting for him to return from the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. Then, they\u2019d charge into the Apricot Cottage and kill him.Except, something unexpected had disrupted their plans.An elderly attendant scampered over, told the group\u00a0laying\u00a0in ambush that the plan had changed, and all of them retreated.What Su Yi didn\u2019t understand was why they\u2019d do this. He had no grudge with Li Moyun.\u00a0Why does he want to kill me?Could this have something to do with Wen Lingzhao?\u00a0Su Yi recalled the incident at the Wen Family matriarch\u2019s birthday banquet.That\u2019s probably the case. According to Huang Qianjun, Li Moyun has been infatuated with her for a long time. He even announced, repeatedly, that he\u2019d marry her or no one.From this, I can infer that he plans to kill me, create an opening, and take my place.Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u00a0This nominal wife of mine sure is trouble.First it was Wei Zhengyang. Now it\u2019s Li Moyun.Now that she\u2019s at Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, and a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple at that, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s already attracted a whole new batch of lascivious, swaggering young men.\u201cMystic Master, you\u2026 what do you plan to do?\u201d Qing Wan asked weakly.\u201cEven if I kill all her admirers, I\u2019ll only be treating the symptoms of the problem, not the root cause,\u201d said Su Yi casually. \u201cAfter this incident, I\u2019m increasingly set on dissolving this marriage. Only then can I rid myself of this problem once and for all.\u201d\u201cMystic Master, you want to repudiate your wife?\u201d Qing Wan said blankly.\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Su Yi right back. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I'm overly heartless, do you?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Qing Wan immediately shook his head.Su Yi slumped back into his chair. Suddenly, he laughed, \u201cForget it. It\u2019s my birthday; let\u2019s not discuss such unpleasant matters.\u201dHe picked the flask off the table and poured himself a drink.Qing Wan said tentatively, \u201cMystic Master, did no one do anything to celebrate your birthday?\u201dSu Yi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked that sort of thing.\u201dQing Wan suddenly seemed more courageous. \u201cThen\u2026. Might I ask how old you are now?\u201d\u201cIf you add it all up, I\u2019m 108,017 years old,\u201d said Su Yi offhandedly. \u201cOh, but you can just think of me as seventeen.\u201dQing Wan was dazed, and she felt a bit lost, but she didn\u2019t ask any questions. After a moment\u2019s silence, she worked up enough courage to say, \u201cMystic Master, how about\u2026 how about I sing a birthday song for you?\u201d\u201cIf you like,\u201d said Su Yi, but his thoughts were elsewhere.Beneath the lamplight, Qing Wan took a deep breath, gently squeezed her red dress, and parted her pink lips. A voice like heavenly song or an ethereal chant soon echoed throughout the room.\u201cThe Mystic Master, long-lived as the moon, rising like the sun, towering like the southern mountains, never to fall or crumble, flourishing like the pines\u2026.\u201dHer voice was soft, like water bubbling from a spring or a stream flowing through a valley.Su Yi was briefly stunned, but soon, a faint smile spread across his face.\u00a0This is an ancient birthday song. The girl\u2019s actually pretty thoughtful.He listened and drank, leisurely and at ease.Outside the window, the night sky gradually darkened, and the stars lit up.Qing Wan\u2019s beautiful, ethereal melody was the perfect complement to a night like this.\u2026\u2026Beneath the same night sky.The Li Family.Li Moyun\u2019s hands clenched his sword, and his handsome face was dark and contorted beyond recognition.He fought back his fury and bitterness, gnashing his teeth so hard, they seemed they might break.Tonight was supposed to be the perfect chance to strike. He\u2019d already arranged everything. As soon as Su Yi was dead, he\u2019d leave for Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy and visit Wen Lingzhao.He\u2019d even prepared the present he was going to give her.But who would have guessed that all of his plans would fall apart at the last minute, and that everything would go to waste?The elderly attendant at his side whispered, \u201cYoung Master, the Family Head has spoken. You\u2019re to leave tonight, and you\u2019re not to enter Guangling City in the near future without his orders.\u201dLi Moyun could no longer repress his fury. He growled, \u201cSo what if that waste has recovered his cultivation? So what if he defeated Mo Tianling? Is Father really going to kick me out just because of that?\u201dHis chest heaved violently.He\u2019d already heard about what happened at the banquet tonight. This was why he\u2019d had to abort his plans.The elderly attendant whispered, \u201cYoung Master, the family head isn\u2019t worried about Su Yi, nor is he concerned about Fu Shan, Huang Yunchong, or Nie Beihu. He\u2019s concerned that your rage will lead you to make an irrevocable mistake.\u201dHe paused, then continued, \u201cRegarding killing Su Yi, we can wait and see. The family head said that Su Yi has other secrets too. We don\u2019t know what they are, but they\u2019re the only explanation for why Fu Shan treats him with such importance.\u201cIf we attack without first uncovering these secrets, we might invite unforeseeable disaster upon the entire Li Family.\u201dLi Moyuan froze. Quite some time passed before he exhaled and said, \u201cI understand. Tell my father I\u2019m leaving for the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital right now!\u201dWith that, he turned to leave.\u201cEscort the young master. Allow nothing to delay your journey. You are to reach the prefectural capital as soon as possible. Understood?\u201d The attendant dashed after him, then ordered the guards waiting outside.\u201cUnderstood!\u201d The guards\u2019 shouted their acknowledgement.Watching this, Li Moyun sighed to himself. He knew that despite agreeing to his father\u2019s arrangements, Li Tianhan didn\u2019t trust him not to sneak back into the city and ambush Su Yi anyway.Once his horse had carried him far beyond the city walls, Li\u00a0Moyun\u00a0turned to look back at the tall, imposing main gate. His eyes flashed with cold, murderous intent. \u201cSu Yi, just you wait!\u201dThen, he and his guards galloped off into the distance.\u2026\u2026Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy.A natural hot spring in a pavilion built atop a verdant mountain peak,It was late and night, and the stars were sparse and faint.Two slender figures soaked in the steaming waters of the hot spring. Only their long white necks and stunningly beautiful faces were visible.The air was misty, and the water rippled.Wen Lingxue sat on a boulder within the spring, only dimly discernible within the mists. She comfortably stretched her long white legs beneath the surface of the water and gently kicked her feet, stirring up warm currents, and her pretty face utterly relaxed and at ease.She raised a hand to wipe the beads of sweat from her brow, then asked in her crisp voice, \u201cBig Sister, what exactly\u00a0did Brother-in-law\u00a0write in his letter?\u201dWen Lingzhao was nearby, her hair up in a bun, her skin like jade. Within the mist, she was an ethereal beauty, like an illusion or a dream.\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Her brow furrowed slightly. Even when she was with her little sister, her features, expression, and temperament were as cold and aloof as ice.Despite her words, she couldn\u2019t help but recall the letter her younger sister had delivered her just a few days ago.It only included one sentence: \u201cI hope you can annul our marriage sooner rather than later. That way, everyone will be happy.\u201dWhen she first saw it, Wen Lingzhao was stunned. Even after extensive pondering, she couldn\u2019t tell whether he meant what he said, or whether this was some roundabout way of poking fun at her.It was just as Su Yi said: she cultivated so bitterly precisely because she felt stifled. She wanted to grow strong through her own hard work, and once she became sufficiently powerful, seize control over her own fate. She didn\u2019t want this sham of a marriage to fetter her any longer!Wen Lingzhao would never have guessed that the Su Yi she ignored, the man she saw as nothing but a stranger, would see right through her.If that were all it was, it\u2019d be one thing, but there was something strange about the tone of his letter.What did he mean, \u201cEveryone will be happy\u201d?No matter how she looked at it, it sounded like he was mocking her!As a result, every time Wen Lingzhao recalled that letter, she felt a discomfort she couldn\u2019t quite put into words.Taking a moment to calm herself, Wen Lingzhao\u2019s icy gaze turned toward her little sister. \u201cI\u2019ve already told our parents that there\u2019s no need for you to follow them back to Guangling City. Going forward, you\u2019ll remain in the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital and continue your cultivation at Blueriver Sword Manor.\u201dShe paused, then said contemplatively, \u201cOnce I\u2019ve officially become Master\u2019s live-in disciple, I\u2019ll come up with some way to get you into Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy. That way, we can be together long-term, and I can take care of you at all times.\u201d As she said this, a barely discernible hint of gentleness entered her voice.\u201cBig Sister, can\u2026 Can I refuse?\u201d Wen LIngxue blinked and said meekly.\u00a0She certainly didn\u2019t want to get stuck here like this.\u201cNo.\u201d Wen Lingxue looked up and gazed at the night sky. \u201cI was unfortunate enough to be forced into marriage with a complete stranger. Lingxue, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll let you suffer the same fate!\u201dThat cold, clear voice of hers revealed a hint of bitterness and hatred.Seth's ThoughtsThe word Qing Wan uses here, \u201crepudiate\u201d, is different from an ordinary divorce. It\u2019s used specifically for when a man renounces his wife.As a live-in son-in-law, Su Yi is not legally entitled to do this to Wen Lingzhao. He cannot \u201csend her back home\u201d or \u201ckick her out\u201d or otherwise \u201cretire her\u201d because he\u2019s currently living in her family\u2019s home.He may or may not be legally entitled to some other form of divorce. Nothing in the text thus far has specified whether or not he can.But assuming divorce in this world works like in ancient China? Odds are he can't. At least, he can't just by going through the legal system.This is a bit of an oversimplification, but in general, divorce in ancient China could happen by court order, mutual agreement, or when a man one-sidedly divorced his wife for one of\u00a0seven pre-approved reasons.Su Yi is male, but he\u2019s married into another family the way women usually did, so the typical roles are inverted, and women were not historically entitled to unilateral divorces. To the best of my knowledge, that went for live-in husbands too.But this isn\u2019t ancient China, and Su Yi is no ordinary live-in son-in-law. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what, if anything, happens between him and Wen Lingzhao. ;)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Winds to Carry You, Lifting You Into the CloudsThe third day of the second month of the lunar calendar.\u00a0Noon, the day after the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.Su Yi finished his cultivation in the mulberry grove. Just as he returned to the Apricot Cottage, he saw Fu Shan and a group of the Old Guard waiting there for him.\u201cMaster Su.\u201d Fu Shan walked up with a smile and cupped his fist. \u201cI\u2019m here to thank you for your assistance at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, as well as to deliver your rewards.\u201dWith that, he waved his hand, and three guards approached. Each of them respectfully proffered a jade box.Fu Shan smiled as he explained, \u201cThese are the prizes for the victor of the Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition. Altogether, there\u2019s a thousand taels of gold, ten clusters of pearls, three stalks of spiritual medicine, and one peak yellow-grade secret martial arts tome.He paused, then continued, \u201cI brazenly took it upon myself to convert the gold to silver notes. That will make it easier for you to carry it on your person, Master Su.He pointed to the first jade box. \u201cThis contains eighteen silver notes. Each is worth ten thousand taels of silver.\u201d\u201cThe second jade box contains three stalks of spiritual medicine. They are, respectively, Jadeleaf Poria, Bloodjade Ginseng, and Blue-Streaked Frostgrass.\u201cAnd the third jade box contains the peak-level yellow-grade martial art, \u2018the Flower-Plucking, Cloud-Sweeping Zen Hand.\u2019\u201dWhen he heard this, Su Yi opened the third box and flipped through the secret tome. After skimming it, even he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cThis martial art is obviously only suitable for women.\u201dFu Shan grimaced. \u201cIt was up to the Cloudfall City Lord, Li Jianyu, to prepare the prizes. He undoubtedly chose that technique as a deliberate insult. If you\u2019re displeased with it, given a little time, I can offer you an alternative martial arts manual instead.\u201dHe was obviously well aware of this martial arts tome\u2019s nature.Su Yi waved his offer away, not the least bit concerned. \u201cNo need. This will be fine.\u201dGiven his standards, how could he possibly take interest in such a low-grade martial arts anyway?\u201cDeliver Master Su\u2019s prizes to his room.\u201d Fu Shan turned and ordered his guards, who immediately got to work.Afterward, he smiled and said, \u201cMaster Su, Spiritbamboo Island belongs to Guangling City once more, and at least for now, it\u2019s under the control of the city lord\u2014me. I\u2019m here today in part to invite you to visit the island.\u201dSu Yi was tempted; he recalled that Spiritbamboo Island had a high concentration of spiritual energy, and that \u201cBluejade Spirit Bamboo\u201d grew there.\u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d asked Su Yi.Fu Shan immediately smiled. \u201cThis way, please. I\u2019ve already prepared a carriage. We can leave right now.\u201d He personally led the way.An hour later.The Old Guard rode warhorses as they escorted Su Yi and Fu Shan\u2019s carriage. The carriage stopped when it reached a spot roughly thirty miles from the city, along the banks of the Great Azure.This stretch of river bank was part of the Azurecloud Mountain Range. There were lush, ancient trees all over the place.Upon exiting the carriage, Su Yi and Fu Shan saw an awning-covered boat ready and waiting for them. They boarded it and crossed the water, nearing the center of the river.The island was small, more islet than island. It was only three hundred feet across. It\u00a0was covered in jagged rocks. Save for the verdant bamboo grove, the island was entirely barren; not even grass grew upon the boulders.\u201cHm? Why are there already people on the island?\u201d\u00a0From a distance, Fu Shan saw a boat moored to the side of Spiritbamboo island, and he could vaguely discern two figures walking amidst the bamboo.His expression instantly darkened.The attendant beside him hurriedly explained, \u201cCity Lord, they are most likely from Cloudfall City! They must have come from the other side of the river!\u201d\u201cLi Jianyu, that old fart. He dared send people to Spiritbamboo Island? Does he really think I won\u2019t dare kill them?\u201d Fu Shan\u2019s eyes flashed with murderous intent. Before long, their boat reached the island.It was then that Fu Shan saw the trespassers clearly for the full time. He couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brow in surprise.It was a youth and an old man.The youth wore jade-colored robes and a broad belt. His skin was clear, his features handsome, and he looked to be in high spirits.The elder wore a small black hat, and he was clad in cloth robes. He looked unexceptional, and his back was slightly bowed as he stood a foot away from the young man.\u201cThe peak of the Qi Accumulation Realm.\u201d At the same time, Su Yi\u2019s gaze landed on the youth and the black-hatted old man. At a glance, he could discern a fair bit just from their auras.The Four Realms of the Martial Dao, Blood Circulation, Qi Accumulation, Inner Furnace, and An\u0101srava.Reaching the pinnacle of the Qi Accumulation Realm was proof that one had already refined their qi to the level of \u201cAstral Manifestation.\u201d Martial artists like that could walk directly on water.On dry land, they could leap a hundred feet in a single bound. Their breath rumbled like thunder, and their vital energy outwardly revealed itself.Only a thin line separated such martial artists from reaching the Inner Furnace Realm and becoming Grandmasters!In Guangling City, someone like him would be a peak-level expert.Fu Shan, for instance, was merely in the late-stage Qi Accumulation Realm. He was a full level lower than the black-hatted elder.But before long, Su Yi looked away. A mere peak Qi Accumulation expert wasn\u2019t worth paying attention to.Instead, Su Yi took this time to silently evaluate Spiritbamboo Island itself.Before long, he nodded to himself. The island was likely connected to the Great Azure\u2019s water vein. The Azurecloud Mountain Range was nearby, so mountains and waters converged, and the essence of heaven and earth gathered here.It was indeed a blessed land, a spiritual ground. It was a step up from the mulberry grove Su Yi had found. No wonder it gave rise to a spiritual ingredient on the level of Bluejade Spirit Bamboo!At the same time, the jade-robed youth and the black-hatted elder noticed the commotion, and both of them looked over.The youth smiled and called out, \u201cMight you be City Lord Fu Shan?\u201dHe was only eighteen, but his every movement carried an air of nobility.And it seemed that meeting Fu Shan, the lord of an entire city, was perfectly normal for him.\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d said Fu Shan. \u201cMight I ask who the two of you are?\u201dHow experienced and crafty was Fu Shan\u2019s gaze? He could tell at a glance that these two were extraordinary. He subtly waved, indicating for his attendant to remain in the covered boat.He and Su Yi then disembarked onto Spiritbamboo Island.\u201cMy name is Zhang Yuanxing. I\u2019m from the prefectural capital\u2019s Zhang Family.\u201d He smiled and cupped his fist. \u201cCity Lord Fu, I once heard my father say that throughout Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s nineteen cities, few people are worthy of attention, but that you\u2019re one of those rare few. Meeting you now, I can see that it\u2019s true: you are indeed extraordinary.\u201dThe Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2019s Zhang Family!Fu Shan\u2019s pupils constricted slightly, and his expression became far more solemn. \u201cMight I ask your honorable father\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cMy master is none other than the current head of the Zhang Family,\u201d said the elder in the black hat, speaking for the first time.Fu Shan\u2019s heart shook, his gaze instantly serious. \u201cAh, I see. I\u2019m flattered to have received such high praise from your esteemed father.\u201dZhang Yuanxing smiled faintly; it seemed he\u2019d anticipated that Fu Shan would react like this. \u201cCity Lord Fu, you won\u2019t blame me for coming uninvited, right?\u201dFu Shan shook his head. \u201cHow could I?\u201dZhang Yuanxing nodded. Then, his gaze shifted from Fu Shan to Su Yi, an admiring look on his face. \u201cLast night, I attended the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet too. Young Lord Su, I watched your match with Mo Tianling. It was spectacular! It made me gasp with amazement.\u201dHe paused, then smiled. \u201cBut I also heard a bit about what happened to you back then, and I learned that your current situation in the Wen Family is\u2026 Well, it seems like it\u2019s not great. If you\u2019d like to change your predicament, I can help you.\u201dInwardly, Fu Shan snickered.\u00a0A disciple of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2019s Zhang Family is indeed lofty and extraordinary.But Su Yi is someone even the Spiritjade Marchioness treats with respect, a transcendent existence!How could he possibly need you to \u2018help him out of his predicament\u2019?Su Yi looked up at the smiling, confident youth and said calmly, \u201cHave you ever heard the phrase \u2018those who offer unsolicited hospitality are surely hiding evil intentions\u2019?\u201dA sharp light flashed through the elder\u2019s eyes. \u201cSpeak carefully, young man. Make sure not to bring disaster upon yourself!\u201dBut Zhang Yuanxing merely smiled and waved him away, not the least bit offended. \u201cElder Xiong, no need to get angry. Young Lord Su\u2019s straightforwardness is the very reason I admire him.\u201dHe paused, then addressed Su Yi directly. \u201cYoung Lord Su, you needn\u2019t overthink this. I want to help you purely because I admire your skills and attainments in the Martial Dao. It would be a waste for someone as talented as you to remain in Guangling City, no different from burying a pearl in the mud!\u201dSu Yi\u2019s expression was strange; it had been a long, long time since anyone had spoken to him like this.When he saw that Su Yi remained silent, Zhang Yuanxing assumed he was hesitating. He couldn\u2019t help but smile confidently, \u201cYoung Lord Su, please relax. If you follow me to Cloudriver Prefecture, I guarantee I\u2019ll give you the chance to show off your brilliance and stand out of the crowd!\u201dSu Yi was stunned. \u201cFrom the looks of it, you\u2026. Want me to follow you as a retainer?\u201dThe man in the black hat snorted coldly, \u201cIn the prefectural capital, there are as many talented young men eager to be at our young master\u2019s beck and call as there are carp in the river, yet those who win his favor are rare as qilin horns and phoenix feathers.\u201dAs if suspecting Su Yi didn\u2019t understand his meaning, the elder added, \u201cLet\u2019s put it like this. In Guangling City, taking first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet is enough to hold your head up high, but in the prefectural capital, there\u2019s no shortage of comparably talented youths!\u201dFinally, the corners of his lips arched upward. \u201cNow you ought to understand just how lucky you are to have won our young master\u2019s admiration.\u201dBy now, Fu Shan had a strange look in his eyes.If not for the other party\u2019s status, he probably couldn\u2019t have held back his laughter.But then, Fu Shan was well aware that neither Zhang Yuanxing nor Elder Xiong knew of Su Yi\u2019s true abilities.\u00a0Otherwise, they couldn\u2019t have possibly put on such airs and lectured him like an inferior.By now, Su Yi was at a loss for words. He didn\u2019t even know how to respond.\u00a0Hmm, it seems that he has good intentions\u2026. Right?\u201cYou can take some time to think it over. I\u2019ll leave Guangling City in three days. You can tell City Lord Fu Shan your decision then,\u201d said Zhang Yuanxing with a personable smile, as if he disdained resorting to coercion.Then, he turned back to Fu Shan. \u201cAlthough the tier of the Bluejade Spirit Bamboo growing here is ordinary, they\u2019re still pretty rare. I\u2019d like to purchase two stalks. Might you be willing to part with them?\u201d\u201cWhichever two strike your fancy, I\u2019d be honored to give to you,\u201d said Fu Shan forthrightly.Zhang Yuanxing shook his head. \u201cCity Lord Fu Shan, as everyone in the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital knows, I, Zhang Yuanxing, have always disdained taking advantage of others.\u00a0Elder Xiong, when we get back to the city, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to deliver a hundred spirit stones to the city lord\u2019s estate.\u201dThe elder in the black hat nodded.Before long, Zhang Yuanxing personally chose two stalks of Bluejade Bamboo. Then, he and Elder Xiong returned their vessel and left.Before their departure, this noble youth of the prefectural capital didn\u2019t forget to exhort Su Yi once more.\u201cYou\u2019ll fly further with strong winds to carry you, and I, Zhang Yuanxing, can send you soaring into the clouds!\u201dSeth's Thoughts\u201cThe Flower-Plucking, Cloud-Sweeping Zen Hand\u201d is a bit of a mouthful, I know. Will it come up again? Maybe, maybe not. In any event, Su Yi isn\u2019t going to use it.The phrase used for \u201cflower-picking\u201d, \u62c8\u82b1, is not the normal one. It's a term often used in a Buddhist context, which is why I added the \u201czen\u201d in there. Really it should be \"chan\" since \"zen\" is Japanese, but \"chan\" is less recognizable....\u00a0So it goes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - A Drumstick Drenched in Cliche DreckZhang Yuanxing and Elder Xiong boarded their boat and left. Before long, they faded from view.Fu Shan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cThe son of the Zhang Family Head has sharp eyes. But it\u2019s also laughable; he doesn\u2019t realize that you\u2019re like a dragon soaring through the heavens. How could you be as simple as he seems to think?\u201d\u201cPeople his age love recruiting talents for their own use,\u201d said Su Yi offhandedly. \u201cAt least he\u2019s ambitious.\u201dFu Shan nodded. \u201cWere he to ask any other talented youth in Guangling City, I\u2019m afraid few would have refused him.\u201dThe Cloudriver Prefectural Capital was the heart of the nineteen cities of the Cloudriver Prefecture. It was a far cry from places as remote as Guangling and Cloudfall City.The Cloudriver Prefectural Capital was home to numerous factions big and small.\u00a0Of them, four stood above all others. These peak-level factions included the prefectural government, which served the Great Zhou Dynasty directly, as well as the prefecture\u2019s number one cultivation faction, Blueriver Sword Manor.\u00a0The other two were large-scale family clans, the Zhang and Yuan Families.All other local factions paled in comparison.As the son of the Zhang Family Head, it was easy to imagine just how lofty Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s status was.\u00a0Even Fu Shan had to treat him with respect.As they conversed, they strolled toward the thirty-foot bamboo grove.The bamboo was lush and vibrant, with a faint, spiritual mist lingering around it. There were only a dozen or so mature bamboo plants. Although there were numerous others growing nearby, they had yet to reach maturity.Mature Bluejade Spirit Bamboo was only about as thick as an arm, and only about ten feet tall. The stalks were lustrous and translucent as jade, and they looked as if they\u2019d been carved from precious stones.Fu Shan carried a spade. He laughed, \u201cIf any appeal to you, just say the word.\u201dSu Yi didn\u2019t stand\u00a0on ceremony. He looked around, then\u00a0chose\u00a0one of the mature stalks.Fu Shan immediately went up to it and used the spade to dig it up, including the roots.It was, after all, a spiritual plant. Even its roots and leaves could be used to make medicine, while the stalk was a spiritual material. It was fair to say that every inch of the bamboo was precious.\u201cMaster Su, please take another look and see if any others appeal,\u201d laughed Fu Shan.\u00a0He\u2019d brought Su Yi here precisely for the purpose of sharing the benefits of winning Spiritbamboo Island. This was also a way to build a closer connection with him.Su Yi thought for a moment, then said, \u201cIf you\u2019re sure, I\u2019d take another two stalks. Any will do.\u201dThe stalk he\u2019d chosen was of particularly high quality. With a few slight modifications, he could make it into an all-natural bamboo sword sheath.He could use it as a walking stick in his daily life, and draw his sword instantly in battle. It would be extremely convenient.Furthermore, this bamboo was a spiritual material, so it could nourish and protect Mortal Edge, too.He planned to use the other two stalks of bamboo to refine a batch of talismans.Rearing beasts and refining talismans, weapons, and pills.Cultivators frequently engaged in all four. In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, they\u2019d already formed a comprehensive system of cultivation based on these skills.Pick a handful of low-class cultivators at random, and they\u2019d all have lots to say about any one of these four subjects.In his past life, Su Yi had been honored as the \u201cMaster of Ten Thousand Daos.\u201d He naturally wasn\u2019t ignorant of talisman refining.Unfortunately, this was the Azure Continent, a spiritually-barren landscape.Even if all he wanted to do was refine talismans, it was hard to find suitable spiritual materials.This Bluejade Spirit Bamboo qualified as a tier-two spiritual material. It was just barely enough to withstand the power of basic talismans.Su Yi naturally wouldn\u2019t pass up such an opportunity.Fu Shan went on to dig up two more stalks of mature bamboo, as well as a\u00a0shoot\u00a0hidden underground, all of which he gave to Su Yi.\u201cMaster Su, this Bluejade Bamboo Shoot is a rare treasure. It\u2019s brimming with spiritual energy, and its flesh is a delicacy. Ordinarily speaking, few could bear to consume something so precious.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Su Yi nodded his appreciation.Fu Shan waved his thanks away. \u201cNo need for such courtesy. If not for you turning the tides at last night\u2019s banquet, Li Jianyu would have seized control over Spiritbamboo Island.\u201dBefore long, they returned to their vessel and began their return journey.\u00a0When they reached the Apricot Clinic, Su Yi stepped out of the carriage. Suddenly, he said, \u201cCity Lord Fu, I might leave Guangling City in the near future.\u201dFu Shan was briefly stunned. Then, he sighed with emotion, \u201cI\u2019ve long since predicted that with your abilities, you couldn\u2019t possibly linger in a tiny place like Guangling City for long. I just didn\u2019t think this day would come so quickly.\u201dHe paused, then asked hesitantly, \u201cMight I ask your destination?\u201d\u201cThe Cloudriver Prefectural Capital,\u201d said Su Yi casually.He\u2019d cultivated in Blueriver Sword Manor for three years, so the prefectural capital was relatively familiar.Today, he\u2019d begun \u201cRefining Bone.\u201d The next step was entering the Qi Accumulation Realm. It was only in a prosperous area like the prefectural capital that he could find resources sufficient to meet a Qi Accumulation Realm cultivator\u2019s needs.Fu Shan nodded. \u201cWhen do you plan to set off?\u201dSu Yi thought for a moment, then said, \u201cA month from now at the latest.\u201dHe wanted to wait for his little sister-in-law to get back first, and he still had to visit Mother Ghost Ridge.Before he left, Fu Shan suddenly recalled something. \u201cRight, Master Su, how should I respond to Zhang Yuanxing?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Su Yi asked right back.\u201cI understand.\u201d After a brief pause, Fu Shan smiled. \u201cWhen you leave, I\u2019ll be sure to see you off personally.\u201dFu Shan and his group quickly left, while Su Yi entered the Apricot Clinic.\u201cSir.\u201d Hu Quan, Wu Guangbin, and the rest of the clinic\u2019s staff set aside the task at hand. All of them, even the servants, turned to look at Su Yi.Their gazes were awed.Word of last night\u2019s Dragon\u2019s Gate Competition had shaken both sides of the Great Azure, stirring up no shortage of waves within Guangling City.\u00a0Who could possibly remain ignorant of the fact that last night\u2019s champion was none other than Su Yi?As such, by the time the staff saw Su Yi enter the clinic, the way they saw him had undergone a cosmic shift.\u201cEveryone, you can return to your tasks,\u201d said Su Yi. After this simple order, he approached Hu Quan. \u201cSteward Hu, do you perhaps know which of our medicine pickers is most familiar with Mother Ghost Ridge?\u201dHu Quan\u2019s expression shifted. \u201cSir, that eerie place is dangerous! Under normal circumstances, it\u2019s very rare for anyone to visit. What do you want to do there?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cI just want to ask a few questions.\u201dHu Quan mulled it over, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s easily done. The Wen Family has over a thousand medicine pickers on payroll, and there\u2019s sure to be someone with the information you need. I\u2019ll ask around for you.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll leave it up to you.\u201d\u201cRest at ease, sir. I guarantee I\u2019ll have this done within the day!\u201d Hu Quan pounded his chest and smiled.Last night, he was fortunate enough to accompany Su Yi to the banquet. Everything he\u2019d seen and heard had practically opened the door to a brand new world, and he\u2019d spent the whole night awash in excitement.He could brag about this experience for the rest of his life.Su Yi didn\u2019t linger. He left through the back door, but surprisingly, when he returned to the Apricot Cottage, there was a beautiful woman waiting for him in the courtyard. It seemed she\u2019d been waiting for quite some time, too.She wore a snowy white dress, and her hair was tied up in a bun. Her eyes were bright, her lips rosy. She was a dainty beauty, but her expression was pitiable, which gave her a certain moving charm.His unexpected guest was none other than Nan Ying.When she saw Su Yi push open the gates, she whirled around to face him, her jade-like features filling with delight.But then, her delight faded. She bit her lip, and her beautiful eyes misted over. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, I\u2019m leaving Guangling City with Uncle Master Zhou today, but I couldn\u2019t help myself; I had to come and see you one last time first.\u201d Her soft voice carried a thread of grief.Were Su Yi any other man, the sight of a weeping beautiful might very well have softened his heart.Another man might assume that she\u2019d been unable to resist coming to see him. Perhaps her feelings for him were too much for her to ignore?But it was as if Su Yi didn\u2019t even notice her. When he did respond, his response was completely off script. He just asked directly, \u201cDid you climb over the wall?\u201dClimb\u2026.Did I climb the wall\u2026?Nan Ying\u2019s delicate, grief-stricken face went slightly rigid. The atmosphere was suddenly uncomfortably silent.But before long, Nan Ying stabilized her heart and sighed. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, I know what I said that day sounded heartless and mean, but if I didn\u2019t care about you, why would I have come looking for you that day?\u201cTrue heartlessness would mean treating you like a stranger. If I didn\u2019t care, I would have just drawn an irrevocable boundary between us. Why would I have visited you again just a year later? Why would I have come at you with such angry nonsense? It was because I lost my rationality and vented a year\u2019s worth of accumulated sadness\u2026.\u201cThat\u2026 That was because I still cared about you!\u201d As she said this, Nan Ying\u2019s voice was choked with sobs, and tears dripped from her beautiful eyes. She looked utterly forlorn.\u201cI\u2019ll admit that what I said back then was hurtful, and I won\u2019t demand you forgive me now, but\u2026 Can you give me a chance to assuage my conscience? I don\u2019t want to leave Guangling City still carrying this guilt.\u201dSu Yi said nothing in response.Nan Ying dashed up to him, frantic, her gaze pleading. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, back at Blueriver Sword Manor, didn\u2019t you say that no matter how many mistakes I made, so long as I changed my ways, you\u2019d forgive me? You\u2026. Surely you\u2019ll forgive me, right?\u201dAs she spoke, she reached for Su Yi\u2019s sleeves.Su Yi stepped back, and her hands grabbed nothing but air.Nan Ying\u2019s gaze was suddenly plaintive. She took a deep breath, then removed an exquisitely carved jade box from her sleeves and gently opened it.Inside was a chicken leg, except it had long since shriveled and rotted. It had a sickly, black sheen, and it looked downright vile.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, do you remember? When you became the outer sect\u2019s Sword Chief, the sect arranged a celebratory banquet. After the banquet ended, you came hurrying to find me with a chicken leg you\u2019d carefully wrapped in a lotus leaf, all because you heard me say I\u2019d yet to eat anything that\u00a0day\u2026.\u201dNan Ying\u2019s gaze was suddenly nostalgic, a mixture of honeyed sweetness and grief. \u201cThat night, I was so happy, I couldn\u2019t even sleep. How could I bear to just eat the gift you gave me? I saved it, because although drumsticks are a common sight, the one you gave me has an irreplaceable position in my heart.\u201dDespite having the temperament of one who\u2019d lived two lifetimes, Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but suck in a breath of cold air. He pointed at the drumstick. \u201cYou\u2026 Have you been carrying that thing with you all this time?\u201dNan Ying whispered, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, I\u2019d rather die than lie about something like that\u2026\u201dSu Yi turned and walked out of the courtyard.This reaction was entirely unexpected.\u00a0Isn\u2019t he supposed to pull me close and wipe away my tears?Caught off guard, she instinctively called out, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, where are you going?\u201dSu Yi stood in the gateway, then turned and laughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m going to find Ni Hao and repeat everything you just told me, word for word. Right, I\u2019ll tell him that \u2018dog blood\u2019, cliche-ridden dreck about the drumstick too. I\u2019m sure that once he hears it, he\u2019ll see you in an entirely new light.\u201dNan Ying reacted as if she\u2019d been struck by lightning, stunned senseless.Was my performance just now over the top?If not, given my understanding of Senior Apprentice Brother Su\u2019s personality, my story ought to have moved him!Seth's ThoughtsLooks like I can't put \"\u00e9\" in the chapter title. Alas.\u72d7\u8840, or \"dog's blood\", is a pretty standard (slang) term for cliche dreck. If you're immersed in this genre, odds are decent you've seen the term before. At least, I think it is. I mostly read raws, so I'm not sure how common the term is in translation. Just to be safe, I decided to leave it out of the title to avoid confusion. Translated a bit more literally, the title of this chapter is \"A chicken leg covered in dog's blood.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Picking Medicine in Mother Ghost Ridge\u201cSu Yi, you\u2019re horrible!\u201d\u00a0Nan Ying froze for a moment, then gnashed her teeth, flung the drumstick into the dirt, and charged out of the courtyard.\u00a0She ran off in a panic.When Su Yi turned back around, he saw the moldy, shriveled drumstick and recalled how infatuated he\u2019d once been with that woman.He was speechless. But then, who dared say they hadn\u2019t encountered this sort of debased woman in their youth?Su Yi shook his head, then returned to his room and began taking inventory of his gains.Eighteen ten-thousand-tael notes lay sprawled across his desk, as well as three spiritual medicines, a secret tome containing a peak yellow-grade martial art, three stalks of Bluejade Spirit Bamboo, and a Spirit Bamboo Shoot.It was fair to say that this time, his harvest was enormous.Unfortunately, although this was an ample supply of silver, it wasn\u2019t of much interest to Su Yi anymore.To the best of his knowledge, you actually could buy certain spiritual medicines with silver in the prefectural capital.But they were ordinary spiritual medicines, and they were absurdly expensive.For instance, the lowest class of spiritual medicines, tier-one medicines, went for as much as thirty thousand taels of silver!Second-tier medicines went for around eighty thousand a piece.But then, even in the markets of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, tier-two spiritual medicines were precious, and whenever they appeared, people snapped them up despite the high prices.That said, Fu Shan told him that buying spiritual medicines was much easier if you used spirit stones to purchase them.This was because, to martial artists, both spirit stones and spiritual medicines were cultivation resources, and both were indispensable.The three medicines before Su Yi were all the lowest-tier, just tier one.But the Spirit Bamboo Shoot looked exceptional. It qualified as a tier-two spiritual medicine.When I get to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, I\u2019ll exchange my silver for spirit stones,\u00a0Su Yi thought to himself.In the prefectural capital, you could trade ten thousand taels of silver for a single tier-one spirit stone.A hundred tier-one spirit stones could be exchanged for a single tier-two spirit stone.At the end of the day, even after proceeding to the prefectural capital, he\u2019d still have to earn money.\u00a0Only then could he obtain a never-ending stream of cultivation resources.Su Yi quickly put the silver notes, medicines, and\u00a0tome\u00a0away. He then exited his room and sat on the stone bench beneath the locust tree, using Mortal Edge to carve a stalk of bamboo.Shavings scattered across the yard, and before long, Su Yi held a brand new bamboo sheath.It was three feet long, roughly the same thickness as an infant\u2019s arm, and blue-green, as lustrous and translucent as jade.Su Yi sheathed Mortal Edge. It fit perfectly; only the hilt remained visible.But Su Yi thought the hilt was a bit of an eyesore too.He thought for a moment, then removed the hilt\u2019s two jutting edges. The sword no longer had a cross-guard, which meant even the hilt could disappear into the bamboo sheath.Finally, he used a bunch of bamboo strands to form a flexible but durable strap and attach it firmly to the top of the sheath. This allowed him to hang his weapon around his waist.Su Yi raised the finished bamboo sheath and examined it.Beneath the light of the sun, it was green and vibrant, with all the translucency of high-quality jade. It was comfortable to hold and felt cool and soft to the touch.It seemed more apt to call it a bamboo staff than a sheath.Su Yi gently shook his wrist, and\u2026Clang!Mortal\u2019s Edge popped out with a low hum.\u201cNot bad. I can use it as a walking stick in my day-to-day life. In battle, all I have to do is draw my blade. It\u2019s a far better look than constantly having a sheathed sword hanging from my waist\u2026.\u201dSu Yi was pleased.Although Mortal Edge only had the barest hint of spirituality, if it spent time within this Spiritjade Bamboo sheath, the bamboo would nourish and transform both the edge and the metal.This was the real reason Su Yi crafted this sheath.Next, he chopped up each of the remaining bamboo stalks, cutting them into seven-inch slices. By the time he finished, he had thirty-six in total.These were spiritual materials, so he could inscribe certain basic talismans upon them, then use them to set up formations, kill enemies, expel ghosts, and perform divinations\u2026Last of all, Su Yi made himself a bamboo hairpin.Of course, he scraped off all of the bamboo\u2019s outer layer, so the hairpin was a bright, simple, elegant white.\u00a0If he wore a\u00a0green\u00a0hairpin on his head, that hint of color might be enough to cause unfortunate misunderstandings.Su Yi approached the mirror and examined himself.The person looking back at him stood with his hands behind his back, his long hair pinned up with a lustrous white bamboo hairpin. A bamboo staff hung at his side. He looked neat and refreshing.Having obtained the experiences and mental state of his past life, he\u2019d become calmer and more indifferent. He had a casual ease, an extraordinary bearing, and a transcendent air.\u201cI\u2019m just seventeen, the prime of my youth. I\u2019m showing no signs of age, which is why I at least have a little bit of my past life\u2019s style.\u201d Su Yi nodded approvingly.Suddenly, Qing Wan\u2019s timid voice emerged from the Soul-Nurturing Gourd as she voiced her approval too. \u201cMystic Master\u2019s appearance reminds me of the poem that goes, \u2018Bai Shilang\u2019s beauty is unparalleled. Throughout the world, there\u2019s not another like him.\u2019\u201dIt seemed she\u2019d grown far braver than before; today, she even dared speak up of her own volition.\u201cIt\u2019s just a good-looking set of skin. Only girls like you care that much.\u201d Su Yi shook his head. He clearly didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201cI might be taking you to Mother Ghost Ridge soon,\u201d he said. \u201cSo make sure you\u2019re prepared.\u201dAfter giving his orders, he walked up to his desk and started crafting the bamboo pieces into talismans.\u2026..Nightfall.Hu Quan led a medicine-picker named Guo Bing to the Apricot Cottage.Guo Bing was aged, with sparse hair. His tall frame was\u00a0bony\u00a0and withered.He wore a conical hat, and beneath it was a terrifying face. Half of it was red, swollen, and bulging, while the other half ranged from blue and purple all the way to black. Worse, his features were hideously distorted, like a ghost. He looked terrifying!\u201cSir, Ol\u2019\u00a0Man Guo is the most experienced medicine picker in the city. Years ago, he used to roam Mother Ghost Ridge.\u201d When he saw Su Yi, Hu Quan introduced the elderly medicine-picker. \u201cOl\u2019 Guo is the most familiar with Mother Ghost Ridge. He knows the place like the back of his hand.\u201d\u201cSteward Hu, you\u2019re exaggerating. I haven\u2019t stepped foot in Mother Ghost Ridge ever since a ghost injured me. It\u2019s been ten years since my last visit.\u201d Guo Bing\u2019s voice was raspy and feeble. It seemed he was in poor health.Su Yi looked Guo Bing up and down. Suddenly, he asked, \u201cWas the apparition you encountered a \u2018Deathbringer\u2019?\u201d\u201cA Deathbringer?\u201d Guo Bing was dazed. He was just an ordinary person, and he knew nothing about ghosts at all.Su Yi explained, \u201cA Deathbringer is one of the lowest classes of vicious ghosts. They\u2019re born of tainted gravesites.\u201cThey're low-class, but if their aura touches you, their Jadefire Yin Poison will invade your body. Mild poisoning results in symptoms like yours, a permanent \u2018Yin-Yang Grimace.\u2019 Furthermore, the poison will corrode your life force day and night. The pain is excruciating.\u201cMore serious poisoning, and within three days, the victim is left with nothing but dried-up bones.\u201dWhen he heard Su Yi\u2019s full explanation, Hu Quan was stunned. This was his first time hearing something so eerie and inauspicious.Guo Bing froze, stunned. Then, he instantly got worked up, his face filling with hope and his voice trembling. \u201cSir, does that mean you have a way to treat injuries of this level?\u201dSu Yi nodded, then said lightly, \u201cYes, but the poison has afflicted you for over a decade, and the Jadefire Yin Poison has already infiltrated your internal organs. Getting rid of it completely won\u2019t be easy.\u201dGuo Bing collapsed to his knees with a thud, then kowtowed. \u201cSir, I beg you, save me! These past ten years, I\u2019ve suffered so much, I almost can\u2019t bear to go on! The pain is more than I can express in words; if not for my wife and son, I would have killed myself a long time ago!\u201cIf you can help me, I\u2019ll happily lead you to Mother Ghost Ridge myself!\u201dSu Yi glanced at Hu Quan. \u201cIn a bit, I\u2019ll write up a medicinal recipe. Go fetch and boil the ingredients.\u201dThen, to Guo Bing, he said, \u201cTake the medicine for half a year, and it will remove every last trace of yin poison in your body.\u201dHu Quan hurriedly agreed. As for Guo Bing, he was so overwrought that he kowtowed repeatedly, weeping and dribbling snot.\u201cEnough. Old Man Guo, Even Doctor Wu praises our family's son-in-law's\u00a0medicinal attainments. He\u2019s agreed to save you, so this medicine is certain to clear up your disease.\u201d Hu Quan helped Guo Bing to his feet. \u201cIf you really want to thank him, tell him everything you know about Mother Ghost Ridge. Leave nothing out.\u201dGuo Bing nodded repeatedly. \u201cSir, do you plan to visit Mother Ghost Ridge?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Su Yi calmly.Guo Bing took a deep breath, then clenched his teeth. \u201cMother Ghost Ridge has a complex terrain, and it\u2019s filled with unpredictable dangers. Words alone are insufficient to describe it. I\u2019m willing to lead the way personally!\u201dHu Quan was frantic. \u201cSir, you can\u2019t go to Mother Ghost Ridge lightly. You\u2026\u201dSu Yi cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ve already decided. Don\u2019t bother trying to dissuade me.\u201dThen, he turned to Guo Bing. \u201cCome to the Apricot Clinic early tomorrow morning, then guide me to Mother Ghost Ridge. You can rest assured; I\u2019ll be sure to bring you back safe and sound.\u201dGuo Bing agreed without a second thought.When he saw this, Hu Quan could only sigh, but he made no further attempts to dissuade them.Now that this was settled, in the interest of prudence, Su Yi took some time that night to prepare several items useful for\u00a0exorcizing\u00a0ghosts. That way, he could fully relax.Morning the next day.Si Yi held a bamboo walking stick. The Soul-Nurturing Gourd was strapped to his waist, and his hair was pinned up with an angled bamboo pin as he leisurely strolled out of the residence.When he reached the clinic\u2019s front doors, he saw Guo Bing waiting for him in his conical hat.But just as the two of them were about to set off, they heard a voice call out from down the street.\u201cGuo Bing, so this is where you were! I finally found you!\u201dSu Yi turned to look and saw a group hurrying towards them from afar.Wen Jueyuan led the pack.When he saw Su Yi standing next to Guo Bing, his pupils constricted, and his expression went somewhat rigid.But Guo Bing didn\u2019t notice the change. He clasped his fist and said, \u201cYoung Master, what was it you needed me for?\u201dHe picked medicine for the Wen Family, and Wen Jueyuan was the family head\u2019s son. He couldn\u2019t be disrespectful.Wen Jueyuan said solemnly, \u201cA distinguished guest has come all the way from the prefectural capital with plans to visit Mother Ghost Ridge. To the best of my knowledge, throughout all of Guangling City, only you have the skills necessary to act as her guide.\u201dGuo Bing froze. He instinctively glanced at Su Yi.\u201cGuo Bing, what\u2019s that look supposed to mean?\u201d Wen Jueyuan scrunched up his brow. \u201cRelax. Once this matter is settled, you\u2019ll receive your fair share of the benefits!\u201dGuo Bing hurriedly explained, \u201cYoung Master, you\u2019ve misunderstood. It\u2019s just that yesterday, I already agreed to escort Young Lord Su to Mother Ghost Ridge.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d This time, it was\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s turn to be stunned.When he next looked at Su Yi, he said stiffly, \u201cWhat do you want to go to Mother Ghost Ridge for?\u201dAlthough his attitude was cold, after witnessing the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, he dared not treat Su Yi with the same imperious attitude he had before.Su Yi played with his bamboo staff and said coldly, \u201cThat\u2019s my business. It has nothing to do with you.\u201dA hint of rage appeared on Wen Jueyuan\u2019s forehead, but he swiftly forced it back down.He stared right into Su Yi\u2019s eyes, pausing for emphasis between each word. \u201cSu Yi, I admit that after recovering your cultivation, you\u2019re extraordinary. Even City Lord Fu Shan attaches great importance to you.\u201cBut don\u2019t forget; you\u2019re still the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law!\u201dHe placed extra emphasis on the words \u201clive-in son-in-law\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - The Girl in Military UniformA live-in son-in-law.This term\u00a0had\u00a0always been derogatory. Although Wen Jueyuan\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t overtly mocking, if you read between the lines, you\u2019d find nothing but disdain.He could admit to himself that, were they to fight, he\u2019d be no match for Su Yi, but in his heart, Wen Jueyuan still looked down on him.Su Yi looked at\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan, shook his head, and sighed. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s harder to admit your own weakness than to acknowledge another\u2019s strength. You\u2019re the leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation, yet you can only resort to using my status to slander me. What a good-for-nothing.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wen Jueyuan\u2019s expression instantly turned incomparably unsightly. Su Yi\u2019s words were like a knife, stabbing him right where it hurt the most.Su Yi looked at him flatly. \u201cWhat, has your shame made you angry? I\u2019m standing right here. So long as you have the courage to attack, I\u2019ll take back what I just said.\u201dWen Jueyuan\u2019s expression shifted back and forth, so furious, his eyes practically spat fire.But in the end, he really didn\u2019t dare do anything.This was because he knew that he had no hope of victory whatsoever, and that if he tried and lost, he\u2019d only embarrass himself even further.Su Yi saw this, but couldn\u2019t be bothered to say anything more.\u00a0He has no guts, nor does he dare admit his own weakness. The \u2018leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation\u2019 is destined never to amount to much.Wen Jueyuan fought back his anger for quite some time before finally spitting through clenched teeth, \u201cSu Yi, don\u2019t be so pleased with yourself! Second Uncle says that as soon as Father gets back, we\u2019ll have a family meeting to discuss how best to punish you!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cI\u2019d actually be thrilled if you ended my marriage with Wen Lingzhao.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wen Jueyuan was at a loss for words.It was then that the sound of urgent hoofbeats rang out from far away. In but a few breaths of time, they reached the Apricot Clinic.A young woman in military uniform led the pack. She sat astride an extraordinary steed.The moment she arrived, she pointed her whip at Wen Jueyuan and said impatiently, \u201cDid you find him?\u201dShe was a slender, fiery little beauty, fully armored, outfitted with both sword and bow. The weapons made her seem somewhat valiant, but her every movement had a commanding, bossy air.A group of retainers trailed after her, like stars clustering around the moon. This further offset just how extraordinary her status was.Wen Jueyuan\u2019s expression shifted, and he hurriedly cupped his fist in greeting. \u201cMiss Yuan, please remain calm. I\u2019ve already found him. This man here is Guo Bing. Throughout all of Guangling City, no one understands Mother Ghost Ridge better than him.\u201dThe girl in military uniform glanced at Guo Bing. When she saw his hideously contorted face, her willowy eyebrows furrowed.But before long, she repressed that thread of disgust and said, \u201cFollow us to Mother Ghost Ridge. As a token of our gratitude, we\u2019ll give you a thousand taels of silver.\u201dGuo Bing shook his head. \u201cMiss, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve already agreed to guide our family\u2019s son-in-law today\u2026\u201dWen Jueyuan instantly cut him off. \u201cGuo Bing, you\u2019re the Wen Family\u2019s medicine picker. Do as I tell you! If you refuse again, don\u2019t blame me for my poor manners!\u201dGuo Bing froze, but he nevertheless steeled himself and said, \u201cYoung Master, forgive\u2026 forgive me, but I\u2019m afraid I cannot follow your orders!\u201d\u201cWen Jueyuan, what\u2019s going on?\u201d The girl in military uniform was somewhat baffled.Wen Jueyuan glared hatefully at Guo Bing, then smiled apologetically and gave her a brief overview of the situation.The girl then glanced at Su Yi for the first time. She looked rather surprised. \u201cYou want to go to Mother Ghost Ridge too?\u201d\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d said Su Yi flatly.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely dangerous. What are you going there for?\u201d The girl furrowed her bow.\u201cWhat are\u00a0you\u00a0going there for?\u201d Su Yi asked right back.This group\u2019s origins weren\u2019t simple. If they were here for Mother Ghost Ridge\u2019s treasures too, that seemed a bit overly coincidental.The armored young woman snorted, \u201cYou refuse to answer my questions, but that\u2019s not all. Now you\u2019re trying to inquire about us? You\u2019re so dishonest!\u201dSu Yi smiled dryly but shook his head. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with a stubborn, unreasonable girl like her.Su Yi turned to Guo Bing. \u201cElder Guo, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYou just don\u2019t listen!\u201d The armored girl on horseback suddenly raised her whip and pointed it at Su Yi. \u201cI\u2019ll say this one last time: that old man has to come with us!\u201dOne word, and her nearby retainers steered their horses forward, weapons in hand and expressions unfriendly. They stared coldly at Su Yi.Guo Bing shivered from head to toe and shrunk back, while a hint of excitement flashed through Wen Jueyuan\u2019s eyes.He was downright eager to borrow the armored girl\u2019s power to teach Su Yi a painful lesson!No one knew better than him how monstrously powerful the faction behind the young woman was. Even if City Lord Fu Shan showed up, he\u2019d be helpless to save Su Yi!But to his disappointment, Su Yi merely furrowed his brow and glanced indifferently at the young woman. \u201cAny other time, I\u2019d disdain to argue with a little girl who doesn\u2019t know her place, but now\u2026 You\u2019ve actually made me a bit angry.\u201dA cold glint flashed through his indifferent, inscrutable gaze, and his aura underwent a dramatic transformation.\u00a0The armored young woman felt a prickling sensation, like a sharp sword pressed against her throat. She felt a chill course through her, and goosebumps rose on her skin.Hair-raising!But before she could react, the mottled white horse beneath her shrieked in terror. Its limbs went soft, and it thudded to the ground, paralyzed.\u201cYoung Miss, are you okay?\u201d The grey-robed man reacted in the nick of time. The instant the horse fell, he flipped through the air, catching the armored young woman mid-fall.Once she was back on solid ground, she said, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201dBut it was obvious she\u2019d been startled. Her beautiful face had paled.When she next looked at her mottled white horse, she saw it whinnying in terror, trembling, too scared to get up.This scene startled everyone present, but more than that, they were baffled. What could have done this to what had always been such an excellent horse?But the girl fixed her gaze directly on Su Yi, her expression ashen. She gnashed her teeth. \u201cWas that your work just now?\u201dWhen he heard that, the grey-robed man and the other retainers\u2019 expressions darkened. They all leaped from their horses and surrounded Su Yi, looking downright murderous.But Su Yi remained completely calm, as if he hadn\u2019t even noticed the impending danger. He glanced at the horse quivering in the dirt and said, \u201cThat beast is far smarter than its owners.\u201d\u201cYou dare mock me?\u201d The girl in military uniform glared, eyes wide. Her pretty face soured.At the same time, Wen Jueyuan instinctively retreated, and when he looked at Su Yi, his gaze was\u00a0pitying.He has no idea who he\u2019s offending right now, does he? If only he knew just how lofty her status was!But against all expectations, just as they drew their swords, Guo Bing stood in front of Su Yi!Beneath the crowd\u2019s shocked gazes, Guo Bing said in a quivering voice, \u201cEveryone, please, don\u2019t be angry. You\u2019re all going to Mother Ghost Ridge, so there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t all travel together. But if you bully our family\u2019s son-in-law, I\u2026. I\u2019d rather die than act as your guide!\u201dAs he made this last declaration, the elderly medicine picker\u2019s expression filled with staunch determination.\u00a0Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but re-evaluate the bony old man before him.The grey-robed man and the girl\u2019s other retainers were already prepared to attack, but hearing this, they hesitated. All of them glanced at the young woman.\u00a0She looked uncertain, her expression alternating back and forth. Finally, she waved and said, \u201cFine. Visiting Mother Ghost Ridge comes first. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t go together.\u201dSomeone has to teach that blasted geezer a lesson!\u00a0Wen Jueyuan inwardly gnashed his teeth. His heart filled with disappointment.\u00a0And here he\u2019d thought that disaster had finally come knocking on Su Yi\u2019s door. Who would have thought Guo Bing of all people would ruin everything?\u201cSir, what do you think of this arrangement?\u201d Guo Bing asked tentatively.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Su Yi.When Guo Bing stood protectively in front of him, he was stunned. At the same time, he was moved.An ordinary old man, someone without a cultivation, hadn\u2019t been intimidated even in the face of such an imposing line-up. On the contrary, he\u2019d stepped up without any regard for his own life. This was truly rare!\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Guo Bing grinned, then sighed, relieved from the bottom of his heart.Although he didn\u2019t know it, if he hadn\u2019t stepped up, someone would have gotten bullied\u2026 But it absolutely wouldn\u2019t have been Su Yi.Of course, the girl and her retainers would surely never guess that Guo Bing\u2019s righteousness had actually saved\u00a0them\u00a0from a potential calamity.\u201cUncle Yong, give them each a horse,\u201d ordered the girl.Her mottled horse had returned to normal, crawling back to its feet. It was affectionately rubbing its nose against her arm, which improved her mood enormously.But whenever she looked in Su Yi\u2019s direction, her gaze was still icy.\u00a0It was clear that this daughter of a prestigious family still carried a grudge over what had just happened.\u201cNo need for horses. We\u2019ll walk,\u201d said Su Yi.The girl instantly snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t you realize that\u2019s a waste of time?\u201dGuo Bing hurriedly explained, \u201cPlease, miss, remain calm. I\u2019m getting on in years, and these old bones cannot withstand the bumps and jolts of a horse\u2019s back.\u201cThe two of us will walk. We can reconvene with you outside the city, by the unmarked graves at the foot of Mother Ghost Ridge.\u201dThe girl took a deep breath, then snapped irritably, \u201cFine, do whatever you want!\u201dWith that, she smoothly turned her horse, squeezed her firm, slender legs, and galloped off into the distance.\u00a0Her retainers hurried after her.Immediately before their departure, the grey-robed middle-aged man she called \u201cUncle Yong\u201d approached Wen Jueyuan and said coldly, \u201cThe others here don\u2019t know who the young miss is, but surely you know? Yet your performance just now was quite problematic; I urge you to behave yourself!\u201dWen Jueyuan\u2019s expression changed dramatically, and his forehead broke into cold sweats.\u00a0Just as he was about to explain, the man in grey galloped off.\u201cWhy did it end up like this\u2026.?\u201d Wen Jueyuan slumped as if he\u2019d lost his soul.Not far away, Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.Earlier, when Wen Jueyuan explained the situation to the armored young woman, his words seemed intended to instigate conflict. He must have thought he could just sit back and watch them fight.But none of them were stupid. Wen Jueyuan knew the girl\u2019s status. Ordinarily speaking, he\u2019d be sure to inform Su Yi and help the girl threaten him.But he did nothing of the sort. Instead, he chose to sit back and watch, like a spectator at a volcanic eruption.That was downright strange.The grey-robed man had clearly seen through Wen Jueyuan\u2019s intentions, which was why he\u2019d warned him before leaving.Wen Jueyuan didn\u2019t even have a firm grip on his backer, yet he wanted to borrow their powers to bully others. At the same time, he wanted to keep himself out of the line of fire. This wasn\u2019t \u201cclever\u201d. It was stupid!Su Yi couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay Wen Jueyuan any further heed. He and Guo Bing proceeded to the city gates.Wen Jueyuan watched Su Yi fade into the distance. His face went green, then white, and his fists clenched.\u201cSu Yi, just you wait! We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re still so brazen after my father gets back!\u201dIt seemed Wen Jueyuan thought that today\u2019s matter went wrong all because of Su Yi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - The Divine Statue Faces Away, Sighing Over the MassesAn hour later.Su Yi and Guo Bing arrived at the unmarked mass graves at the foot of Mother Ghost Ridge.They were greeted by the sight of overgrown grass, scattered headstones, and crows perched on distant leafless trees. From time to time, the birds let out raucous, unpleasant cries.Although it was still early in the morning, this scenery was enough to make someone panic.The uniformed young woman and her entourage had clearly been waiting for quite some time.\u00a0When they saw Su Yi and Guo Bing stroll leisurely toward them, the girl snorted in cold displeasure. \u201cYou\u2019re finally here!\u201dShe then jumped from her horse and ordered, \u201cHave two people stay behind to look after the horses. Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the others are to accompany me into the mountains.\u201d\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am!\u201d The attendants quickly got to work.\u201cGuo Bing, lead the way,\u201d ordered the girl.Guo Bing hurriedly obeyed. When Su Yi saw this, he went after him. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201dHe\u2019d agreed to ensure Guo Bing\u2019s safe return, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t let Guo Bing take the lead by himself.\u201cWho\u2019d\u2019ve thought a stubborn guy like you still had a bit of a conscience?\u201d The girl\u00a0in military\u00a0uniform mocked.Su Yi simply ignored her; he wouldn\u2019t lower himself by losing his temper at an unreasonable little girl, a child who\u2019d obviously been spoiled from a young age.The girl thought about it, then ordered, \u201cUncle Yong, you go up front too. Don\u2019t let Guo Bing face any danger.\u201dThe grey-robed middle-aged man she called Uncle Yong immediately did as he was told. Soon, he and Su Yi both flanked Guo Bing, one on each side.Guo Bing was shocked and flattered. He thanked them both repeatedly.But Su Yi inwardly shook his head.\u00a0This is a type of protection, but it\u2019s also a type of surveillance. There\u2019s nothing praiseworthy about it.The group proceeded, venturing further into the unmarked graveyard.They passed numerous long-abandoned, overgrown graves. They spotted many dried bones, scattered joss paper, used incense, and broken candles amidst the underbrush.The further they went, the deeper the grass and the thicker the mist. Aside from the occasional call of a crow, it was incomparably desolate and silent.Guo Bing held his hunting knife, cutting a path through the grass and brambles. He forged ahead with confidence; this was familiar territory for him.\u201cSir, what is it you want to do in Mother Ghost Ridge?\u201d Guo Bing suddenly asked.The girl in military uniform instantly pricked up her ears.\u201cFirst, tell me: does Mother Ghost Ridge have any particularly strange or eerie places?\u201d asked Su Yi.Guo Bing thought about it, then said, \u201cMother Ghost Ridge has always been prone to haunting. If you\u2019re looking for particularly strange or eerie places, there are actually several of them.\u201cOne is the temple halfway up the mountain in the white pine forest. It\u2019s been abandoned and in disrepair for a long time. Inside is a statue of a god, but it faces away from the doorway, and its head has long since gone missing.\u201dThe girl couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThe statue is facing away from the gates? Are you sure someone didn\u2019t move it on purpose?\u201d\u201cWhy turn away from the world? Because you sigh over the masses\u2019 unwillingness to see the light. If you ask me, this statue must be of Buddhist origins.\u201dGuo Bing was briefly stunned. Then, he said admiringly, \u201cYou\u2019re definitely well read, sir. Far more so than ordinary folk like me.\u201dThe armored girl snorted from further back, seemingly in disdain.Su Yi turned a deaf ear to this, then asked, \u201cAside from its strange statue, is there anything else strange or creepy about the temple?\u201dGuo Bing said, \u201cYes. Quite a bit, too. They say that at night, you can hear chanting from within the abandoned temple. Some say that it\u2019s the sound of ghosts conversing among themselves. All I know for sure is that if you spend the night at the temple, you absolutely cannot extinguish your campfire. Otherwise, the ghosts hidden in the darkness will emerge to devour you. Similar incidents have occurred numerous times in the past.\u201d\u201cOrdinary ghosts can\u2019t hurt us.\u201d The armored young woman\u2019s proud, confident voice drifted over from behind them. She\u2019d obviously been listening in.\u201cWhat about the rest of Mother Ghost Ridge?\u201d asked Su Yi.Guo Bing really was the medicine-picker best acquainted with Mother Ghost Ridge. He went on to explain its situation and layout in detail.But there were only three places that Su Yi took special note of.The first was a \u201cpeach orchard\u201d west of Mother Ghost Ridge. It was shrouded in miasma year round. Anyone who entered, regardless of whether they were human or animal, never found their way back out.Another was a place called \u201cThe Mountain Ghost\u2019s Path.\u201d It was on the other side of the mountain. The winding road was shrouded in blood-colored fog. Anyone who stepped into it was subject to ghosts attacking in a mad frenzy.The last was the building standing at the peak of Mother Ghost Ridge. It was nothing but ruins, but rumor had it that long ago, it had been a temple to the City God. At night, fluorescent jade will-o-the-wisps appeared there. Any living person foolish enough to draw near would burn right down to their bones.Those three places aside, there were several other danger zones in Mother Ghost Ridge.But the way Su Yi saw it, the \u201cSix-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse\u201d was sure to haunt one of those three!So long as he picked the right spot, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to find the inauspicious spirit vein, the Six Yin Grass, or the Extreme Yang Flowers, either.\u201cGuo Bing, first lead us to that peach orchard!\u201d The armored girl suddenly spoke up. She\u2019d heard his description too, and she\u2019d made up her mind.Guo Bing trembled. \u201cMiss, that\u2019s a perilous place\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo need to say anymore,\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cJust lead the way. We guarantee your safety.\u201dGuo Bing sighed, then turned to Su Yi. \u201cWhat do you think, sir?\u201d\u201cNo harm in going there first,\u201d said Su Yi lightly. He was already starting to suspect that he and the girl had a common objective.But natural treasures were ownerless objects, and finding them was a matter of fate. If, when the time came, it came down to a struggle, he wouldn\u2019t be polite.When she heard this, the girl\u2019s willowy eyebrows knit together.The guard beside her lowered his voice and said, \u201cYoung Miss, there\u2019s no need to worry. If he interferes with our operation, we can just kill him.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d She grunted but said nothing more.By now, they\u2019d already passed through the unmarked graves. Guo Bing led them down a rough trail and toward Mother Ghost Ridge.After arriving, the clear skies suddenly dimmed. Everything was shrouded in dense, dark clouds, creating a catch of darkness.Mountain winds blew past, rustling the trees and grasses. A suffocating presence started to permeate the air.\u201cSinister yin mists are rising throughout the mountain, and vicious energies are spreading. This really is the type of place most likely to give rise to malevolent ghosts,\u201d said Su Yi, as if lost in thought.One look at the mountains, and he picked up some clues.\u201cEveryone, be careful. We\u2019ve already entered the mountains, and it\u2019s highly likely that we\u2019ll encounter unpredictable dangers along the way,\u201d said Guo Bing. He took out a protective talisman and hung it from his neck, his expression serious and alert as could be.\u201cEveryone, have your weapons at the ready. Don\u2019t get complacent. If we encounter danger, remember to protect the young miss right away,\u201d said the grey-clad Uncle Yong solemnly.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The guards immediately took action.The girl in military uniform drew her sword too, only to see Su Yi just standing there, holding nothing but a bamboo staff, as if none of this had anything to do with him.Despite herself, she was stunned. A moment later, she snorted, suddenly eager to encounter a ghost or two and see Su Yi scared out of his wits.\u201cElder Guo, hold this bamboo talisman in your hand. It will protect you.\u201d Su Yi took out a seven-inch piece of bamboo and handed it to Guo Bing.Guo Bing was surprised, but although he wondered what use a trinket like that could possibly be, he still hurriedly accepted it. \u201cThank you, Sir!\u201dUncle Yong watched this play out, and when he saw the bamboo talisman, he couldn\u2019t help but stare.Although he couldn\u2019t see what specifically was inscribed on it, he could tell at a glance that it was made of Bluejade Spirit Bamboo!Never mind that his staff is made of Bluejade Spirit Bamboo. He just casually gave a talisman of such precious materials to a mere medicine-picker. I\u2019m afraid this\u00a0Su kid isn\u2019t simple.\u00a0Uncle Yong\u2019s brow furrowed slightly.Back in the city, Wen Jueyuan had introduced Su Yi simply as their Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law, someone of little importance.But looking at him now, it seemed things weren\u2019t that simple.Shortly after, Uncle Yong set those thoughts aside. His status and cultivation were enough to guarantee that nothing would go wrong with this expedition.As they forged their way ahead, the cloud cover became denser and denser. It was the middle of the day, but it seemed as if they\u2019d plunged into endless darkness.Furthermore, the mountain mists obscured their field of view, forcing them to slow their pace.Suddenly, a piercingly cold wind swept past. Guo Bing shuddered, and his expression shifted. \u201cThis is bad! A ghost has locked onto us! Hurry and retreat; we can\u2019t proceed any further!\u201dBut it was then that Uncle Yong snorted coldly, drew the saber he had strapped to his back, and leaped forward.Slash!A dazzling streak of red saber light shot into the mist, followed by an agonized wail.The shriek only lasted an instant before coming to an abrupt halt.\u201cIt was nothing but a low-class yin soul. It wasn\u2019t even sentient; no need to panic. Guo Bing, you can continue leading the way.\u201d The grey-robed Uncle Yong walked back, his expression calm. Murderous intent lingered around him.Guo Bing sighed, feeling much more at ease. He clasped his fist and said, \u201cWith an expert like you here, I don\u2019t feel the least bit afraid.\u201dAnother peak Qi Accumulation Realm martial artist. This level of cultivation is practically unheard of in Guangling City, yet here he is, acting as a mere bodyguard. I\u2019m afraid this girl\u2019s status is no lower than that Zhang Yuanxing guy from the prefectural capital,\u00a0thought Su Yi.Cultivation at the peak of the Qi Accumulation Realm\u00a0put\u00a0you near the top of the Great Zhou\u2019s martial artists, just beneath Inner Furnace Realm Grandmasters!The group continued forging ahead, without any more unexpected incidents.They had Guo Bing to thank for this. Without his understanding of the area, they would undoubtedly have encountered numerous dangers.Mother Ghost Ridge was just a single mountain, but it was huge, covering tens of miles. Its rocks were jagged, and its vegetation flourishing, with dense underbrush.Add that to the dark clouds and dense mists, and the group\u2019s speed slowed significantly.A full two hours passed before they finally reached the mountain\u2019s halfway point.\u201cSir, look over there! The run-down temple I told you about is there, deep in the pine forest.\u201d Guo Bing pointed into the distance.The group looked over, only to see a lush forest of white pines. They were barely discernible through the mists, but there was no way to see into their depths.\u201cIf it\u2019s already dark by the time we head back, we can always spend the night at the run-down temple.\u201d Guo Bing said this and was just about to proceed when a barely discernible, fiery glow lit up the distant white pine forest.\u201cHm?\u201d Su Yi and Uncle Yong, both positioned at the front of the group, noticed this at almost the same time.Jaspaaar's ThoughtsThis chapter includes describes a pretty specific subset of Boddhisatva statue. It was really confusing, honestly, and I\u2019m still a bit confused. I think I got it? At the very least, I did my best.The specific phrase Su Yi and the title use (\u201cWhy turn your back on the world? Because you sigh over the masses\u2019 unwillingness to see the light\u201d) is a reference to a specific statue and the mythology around it. I found exact matches for the quote, as well as articles about it by doing a little googling. Here\u2019s the\u00a0temple\u00a0and\u00a0the actual statue.But the statue described in the novel is a bit different. The real statue is described as sitting in \u201cin reverse\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s facing away from the door; that means its in the south, facing north, which is not the usual orientation. It\u2019s a relief carved into the back wall of a temple, so you couldn\u2019t move it without destroying it or moving the whole wall. There\u2019s no way you could just rotate it.The story here is, however, clearly described as facing away from the door, hence my initial confusion. I\u2019m not sure if this is a mistake on the author\u2019s part or if he\u2019s deliberately playing with the mythology here. Let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt and assume the latter, shall we?I don\u2019t have time or energy to translate the whole legend behind the original statue (I spent too much time on this bit already), but here it is in a nutshell: a young man is going down the wrong path in pursuit of wealth/women/power, and an old woman tries to help him mend the error of her ways, but this just makes him angry. He kicks her out, but then it turns out that she was really the Goddess Guanyin\u2026. He later gets struck by lightning and dies, which would have been preventable if only he\u2019d just listened.Guanyin is upset and frustrated by this. The idea is that, for all the Boddhisatva\u2019s power, she cannot make someone mend their ways if they\u2019re not willing to listen. So it\u2019s a story about people not knowing what\u2019s good for them and stubbornly refusing help.On a different note, you can read more about the City God\u00a0here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Malevolent Spirits Run Rampant, Without the Light of BuddhaThe light only lasted an instant, then disappeared without a trace.Uncle Yong thought for a moment, then turned to the armored girl behind him. \u201cMiss, there seems to be a person lurking deep in the white pine forest.\u201d\u201cA person?\u201d The girl in military attire wasn\u2019t the least bit scared. On the contrary, she looked curious. \u201cDoes that mean someone has come to Mother Ghost Ridge, just like us?\u201d\u201cMost likely,\u201d said Uncle Yong in a low voice.\u201cThat\u2019s actually rather interesting,\u201d said the girl after a moment\u2019s thought. She quickly made up her mind. \u201cSince we ran into them anyway, we might as well go take a look. It won\u2019t take up too much time.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s brow furrowed slightly, but in the end, he said nothing.The group changed course, heading toward the distant white pine forest.They were already halfway up the mountain. The entire route was covered in wild grasses tall enough to reach their knees; there was no \u201cpath\u201d anywhere in sight.Guo Bing waved a hunting knife, clearing the grass from their path. He smiled. \u201cDuring the day, that ruined temple is perfectly safe. It\u2019s at night that you have to be careful.\u201dBefore long, the group entered an area covered in white pine trees.The trees towered into the sky, their needles blocking out the heavens. White mists lingered in the air. As they walked, all they saw was the eerie darkness of the forest.The ground was covered in a dense layer of rotting leaves, the air pungent.Suddenly, Guo Bing, who was leading the way ahead, staggered. If Su Yi hadn\u2019t reacted and caught him just in time, he would have tripped and fallen.When Guo Bing saw the object that had almost tripped him, the blood drained from his face.It was a skull buried in the rotting leaves. It was stained and covered in dust, its empty eyes staring up into the sky.\u00a0One look was enough to make one\u2019s hair stand on end.However, Su Yi merely glanced at it, then looked away. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dUncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the others maintained their composure too, all of them calm as could be.It was just a skull, that\u2019s all. To martial artists like them, warriors who\u2019d experienced countless bloody battles, it was nothing at all.But not long after they resumed their journey, Su Yi stopped.In the distance, he saw shriveled skin after shriveled skin hanging from the white pines. There were over a hundred of them, all hung close together.They included men and women, elders and children. Nothing remained of them but skin. Their hair was disheveled, and they were a terrifying sight to behold, especially in the creepy, dimly lit woods.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Uncle Yong\u2019s pupils dilated; he was obviously unsettled.The girl in military uniform couldn\u2019t help but go rigid. \u201cWhat the hell are those creepy things?\u201dThe nearby guards clenched their weapons and drew closer to her, their expressions solemn.Guo Bing was already so scared that he was quivering from head to toe, and the blood had drained from his face. He said in a shaking voice, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before either. How about\u2026 How about we leave?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d said Su Yi lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of long-dead corpses.\u201dSuddenly, Uncle Yong spoke up. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, these corpses were likely devoured alive by Ghoul Worms. And in this world, only the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate raises wicked creatures like that!\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate destroyed a long time ago?\u201d The uniformed girl\u2019s eyebrows shot up.\u201cMiss, I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t know the full story. It\u2019s true that the Hidden Dragon Sword Sect rooted the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate out many years ago, but that heretical faction had numerous disciples, who in turn had disciples of their own. Many evildoers had already gone into hiding, allowing them to escape calamity.\u201dUncle Yong continued gravely, \u201cOver the past few years, a series of bloody, evil incidents have occurred throughout the Great Zhou\u2019s borders. We suspect the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate\u2019s involvement. In other words, the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate shows signs of rising from the ashes.\u201dHe paused, then frowned. \u201cLooking at those hanging corpses, although the wind and rain have worn away the skins, they\u2019re still well-preserved and mostly intact. It\u2019s obvious that they died within the past few years.\u201dThe uniformed girl\u2019s expression changed dramatically. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s highly likely members of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate are lurking in Mother Ghost Ridge?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, miss,\u201d said Uncle Yong gently. \u201cHeretical cultivators of their level are like rats; they only dare hide away in barren mountains and untamed rivers; they don\u2019t amount to much.\u201dThe girl gnashed her teeth. \u201cUncle Yong, I suspect the abandoned temple deep in the white pine forest has become a gathering point for the evildoers of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate. I want\u00a0to go investigate. If that\u2019s indeed the case, we can level the place. In doing so, we\u2019ll be carrying out heaven\u2019s will and protecting the people from this scourge!\u201dSu Yi couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. He hadn\u2019t realized that this unreasonable, bossy girl was so brave and big-hearted.\u201cAlright.\u201d Uncle Yong nodded.Although Guo Bing was strongly opposed to this dangerous endeavor, when he saw that Su Yi had no objections, he could only steel himself and go along with it.Shortly after passing the hanging skins, they saw a building in the distance. It was only dimly discernible through the mists.When they drew closer, they could see it more clearly. It was old and in disrepair. Weeds and vines grew nearby, but it did look like a temple.\u201cIt\u2019s true; there really have been people frequenting this place lately.\u201d At a glance, Uncle Yong saw that someone had cut the weeds growing on the stone staircase, clearing a path for people to walk.\u201cEveryone, be careful.\u201d After giving this order, Uncle Yong proceeded to the temple.Upon passing through the gates, he saw a dilapidated courtyard. The idol statue there had fallen into the dirt, and plants now grew on its surface.Near the front of a palace was a grand hall. No one had repaired it in a long time, and it was on the verge of collapse. Its red lacquer was flaking off, and\u00a0its\u00a0doors and windows were broken, the very picture of desolation.As soon as Su Yi and company arrived, a cold voice emanated from within the hall.Immediately afterward, a figure charged towards them.It was an old man, as gaunt as bamboo. He wore black robes, and his eyes glowed with faint, yet terrifyingly unnatural jade light.When he saw Su Yi and the others, the old man\u2019s expression shifted dramatically. He immediately reached for the bone flute at his waist and\u00a0blew, hard.Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!The shrill sound of a flute shattered the silence, the sound piercing.\u201cYou\u2019re seeking death!\u201d Uncle Yong\u2019s expression darkened. He drew his saber with a clang, then leaped forward, traversing a hundred feet in a single bound.Whoosh!The icy, glinting saber seemed to burst into flames. It now shone with a piercing, fiery red glow as he swung at the old man\u2019s skull.The gaunt elder turned and fled back into the hall, but he was half a step too slow.The red saber light slashed down, tearing a long, narrow gash in his back. Fresh blood exploded from the wound; he\u2019d almost been cut in two.Thud!As the gaunt elder fell into the dirt, he shrieked, \u201cDon\u2019t even think of getting out of here alive!\u201dBefore his words finished even finishing echoing through the courtyard, he breathed his last.Uncle Yong approached, then picked up the old man\u2019s bone flute. After examining it, he couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cUncle Yong, was that old man a fiend of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate?\u201d The girl hurried over, but when she saw the body, she seemed a bit disappointed. \u201cNo, he seemed a bit too weak. He couldn\u2019t even block a single one of your attacks.\u201d\u201cThat was just a small fry at the Refining Muscle stage of the Blood Circulation Realm,\u201d said Uncle Yong. He frowned. \u201cBut that bone flute he played just now was obviously a call for reinforcements. I\u2019m afraid there are numerous other members of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate in the area.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? Uncle Yong, with you here, we\u2019ll kill any who show up,\u201d said the uniformed girl, not the least bit concerned.Then, her willowy brow knit; she just saw Su Yi walk into the hall. Inside was another statue, which he was currently examining, as if nothing had happened just now.She strode towards him on her long, jade-like legs, then asked in a huff, \u201cHey! Don\u2019t you realize that we saved your life just now? But instead of thanking us, you have the time and energy to spare on\u00a0that\u00a0of all things?\u201dSu Yi was stunned. \u201cYou saved my life?\u201d\u201cYou think otherwise? Without us, would you have dared come here? Even if you did, the fiends of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate would have surely killed you. Without us, you\u2019d be just another empty skin hanging from a pine tree by now!\u201dThe girl glared, her words filled with cold mockery.Su Yi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t so much as ripple. \u201cRemember: you are here with me and Elder Guo, not the other way around. If you were really that capable, you would have just come here on your own.\u201dAs he said this, he ignored her completely and walked to the other side of the hall.The girl had numerous flaws.\u00a0For instance, she had a poor temper, she was prone to arrogance and tantrums, and she loved to boss others around.But none of her flaws were\u00a0that\u00a0bad.Su Yi certainly wouldn\u2019t turn this into a real fight over a few insults. It wasn\u2019t worth it.The uniformed girl stared at Su Yi, so angry, her chest heaved. Her pretty little face frosted over, and she audibly clenched her pearly white teeth.But despite her anger, she couldn\u2019t argue with what Su Yi had just said.Meanwhile, Uncle Yong had watched this entire scene play out. He was inwardly displeased too.No matter what he said, by accompanying them, Su Yi had reaped enormous, entirely undeserved benefits.\u00a0After all, had he come here without them, who knew how many dangers he would have encountered along the way?That kid looks clever, but it seems he still hasn\u2019t realized just how lofty the miss\u2019 status is. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid he wouldn\u2019t dare argue with her like that.\u00a0Uncle Yong inwardly shook his head, then cast those thoughts aside.He was well aware that nowadays, each youth was more arrogant than the next. Their confidence was through the roof.Su Yi\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t at all strange.\u00a0After all, without a bit of arrogance, could you even be called a youth?It was obvious that someone had cleaned the hall\u2019s interior; it was clean, at least relatively speaking, without the usual dust and cobwebs of an abandoned building.The idol statue at the center of the hall faced away from the door, but its head was missing. The colored clay of its body was cracked, and there was nothing overtly special about it.But on the sides of the hall, Su Yi discovered a few paint marks.The paint was mottled and damaged, the colors indistinct, but he could still dimly discern that the painted walls depicted living things trapped in the suffering of the mundane world.A Bodhisattva stood amidst the ignorant masses, expression compassionate. They seemed to be delivering a sermon.They see the agony of the masses and wish to share their doctrines and redeem the people? It\u2019s a lovely thought, but alas, this temple has been in disrepair for a long time. Worse, it\u2019s haunted. Ghosts and evildoers run rampant. Only the light of the Buddha is nowhere to be seen. How desolate.\u00a0Su Yi lamented to himself.In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, Buddhism flourished. Buddhists had their own province and countless disciples. Their altars were lit with incense year-round.But in a mundane nation like the Great Zhou, it seemed Buddhist monks had it awfully rough\u2026Meanwhile, the uniformed girl was still in a huff, her pretty lips pursed in displeasure. Seeing this, one of the guards silently approached and whispered, \u201cMiss, how about we teach that pipsqueak a lesson? Or we could just kill him and be done with it. In any event, we\u2019re all the way in the mountains and far from the city. No one will know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - A Rainy Night, Murder Comes with the WindThe girl in military uniform was sixteen this year, and she was used to getting whatever she wanted. If she wanted wind, it was windy. If she wanted rain, it rained. She\u2019d never encountered someone as stubborn as Su Yi before.She was well aware that the people clustered around her weren\u2019t afraid of her, but rather, the authority of the clan behind her.But she never would have guessed just how awful it would feel to meet someone who truly wasn\u2019t intimidated by her, and worse, who dared talk back on multiple occasions.Especially since, judging from Su Yi\u2019s attitude, he disdained arguing with her. This dealt an enormous blow to her sense of self-respect.Still, when she heard the guard\u2019s suggestion, she nevertheless clenched her teeth and refused.\u00a0Her conceited pride made her unwilling to let others do her dirty work like that!She took a deep breath, then ordered, \u201cGoing forward, no matter what dangers that guy runs into, don\u2019t do anything to save him unless he lowers his head and begs!\u201dShe made no attempt to lower her voice, as if she disdained the secrecy, or as if she wanted Su Yi to hear her.Unfortunately, all she saw was his back. He didn\u2019t so much as turn to look at her. It seemed he didn\u2019t take her words the least bit seriously.This left her gnashing her teeth in anger. She took several deep breaths for fear of losing control of her temper, charging, and cutting Su Yi\u2019s head clean off.\u201cMiss, you mustn\u2019t be angry. Our family\u2019s son-in-law is no ordinary person either.\u201d Guo Bing seemed to have picked up on the strange atmosphere. He smiled apologetically and explained in an attempt to alleviate the hostility between her and Su Yi.\u201cIs he that tough?\u201d She snorted coldly.Guo Bing didn\u2019t seem to pick up on her disdain. He said proudly, \u201cThat\u2019s only natural! At the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet two nights ago, our family\u2019s son-in-law suppressed every other challenger and seized the top spot! This incident shook both sides of the Great Azure. They\u2019re discussing our family\u2019s son-in-law even over in Cloudfall City!\u201dThe girl was briefly stunned. Then, she stared at the distant Su Yi, seemingly enlightened. \u201cSo that\u2019s why! No wonder he\u2019s been so haughty. He took first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet and now he thinks he\u2019s got stuff!\u201dThis time, Guo Bing finally picked up on the mockery in her words. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit displeased.\u00a0She might be young, but how can she be so blind?\u00a0Does she think taking first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet is an ordinary feat?Guo Bing shook his head, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain any further.Little did Guo Bing know, in the uniformed girl\u2019s eyes, taking first place in an event as paltry as Guangling City\u2019s little Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet really was nothing at all!\u2026\u2026Rumble!Low thunder rumbled over the horizon, shaking the tiles of the dilapidated temple. Clumps of dust fell from the rafters.The uniformed girl was stunned. She immediately looked outside the hall.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s about to rain.\u201d Uncle Yong furrowed his brow.Martial artists were the most sensitive to changes in heaven and earth. Just as the thunder rumbled overhead, Uncle Yong picked up a hint of moisture in the air.As expected, shortly after that distant rumbling, rain started pouring down in buckets, plunging all of heaven and earth into darkness, as if night had fallen already. Raindrops clattered against the temple roof in rapid succession.The rain and dark clouds enveloped the distant, towering white pine forest. The intermittent flashes of lightning within the clouds lit up the trees. Amidst the fierce winds and rain, they looked like a pack of ghosts and goblins baring their teeth and swinging their claws.Cold, dark, and imposingGuo Bing cried out in alarm, \u201cHurry, light a fire! Mother Ghost Ridge is most dangerous when it rains. Whatever you do, you cannot go out. Otherwise, you\u2019re surely doomed!\u201dHis hideously contorted, perpetual grimace filled with sheer terror.Uncle Yong instantly grew solemn. Not daring to be negligent, he ordered the others, \u201cThe few of you are to get a fire going. The rest of you, dispose of the corpse, then stand guard outside the grand hall. Make absolutely certain none of those villains sneak in under the cover of rain.\u201dThe guards hurriedly got to work.\u00a0Before long, they\u2019d built a blazing fire, which dispersed the dark, sinister atmosphere of the grand hall.The girl and her guards sat around the fire. Some of the guards were carrying food with them, which they offered to the girl. There was wine, meat, and light refreshments. It was actually rather sumptuous.The girl took some of the wine and meat and passed them to Guo Bing. \u201cEat up!\u201dHe gulped, then gazed outside the great hall, looking a bit hesitant. \u201cSir, it\u2019s likely already noon. How about you come eat with us too?\u201dSu Yi simply stood beneath the eaves, staring into the distant rain. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201dThe uniformed girl snorted. \u201cThis food wasn\u2019t for you in the first place!\u201dTime slipped by.The girl and her entourage were soon fully sated, but it was still pouring outside, and the rain showed no signs of letting up.Su Yi had long since returned to the hall. He sat alone, facing away from the statue before the gates, his eyes closed in silent meditation.The statue turned away from the populace.\u00a0And Su Yi? He turned away from the statue. The two rather complemented each other.Thud! Thud! Thud!The rain fell against the roof, and mists rose within the darkness.Outside, it was pouring, and the winds were fierce, but within the great hall, the campfire was toasty warm.Uncle Yong had the saber he usually kept strapped on his back across his knees. He faced the gateway, his back perfectly straight. His eyes were closed as he recovered his energy.The other guards were quietly talking amongst themselves.Guo Bing was curled up on one side of the fire, looking fretful. He could tell that rain of this intensity was unlikely to let up by nightfall.This meant it was highly likely they\u2019d have to spend the night in the abandoned temple.The uniformed girl was already a bit impatient. She muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long! Why haven\u2019t those villains of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate shown up yet?\u201dAlmost as soon as she said that, Su Yi\u2019s eyes popped open.Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!The ambient yin energy suddenly surged like a whirlwind, popping the tightly sealed door to the grand hall right open.The blazing campfire surged, scattering countless sparks, but within a few seconds, it had fizzled out completely.This plunged the entire hall into complete darkness.\u201cProtect the young miss!\u201d\u201cCareful! That\u2019s a swarm of Ghoul Worms!\u201d\u2026.The interior of the hall was in complete chaos. The guards\u2019 shouts and the sound of weapons leaving their sheaths echoed throughout the pitch-black great hall.At almost the same time, Guo Bing felt himself lifted into the air; someone had grabbed him by the back of his shirts.One sudden development after another had already scared him almost out of his wits, but just as he was about to scream and struggle, Su Yi\u2019s calm voice whispered into his ear, \u201cElder Guo, don\u2019t panic.\u201dGuo Bing paused, stunned. Then, he exhaled and stopped struggling.The hall was so dark that they could see practically nothing at all.Yet Su Yi walked as calmly as if he were taking a stroll, carrying Guo Bing and returning to the statue.The darkness restricted his vision, just like it did the others\u2019. He could see only dimly.But this didn\u2019t hinder his movements.On the contrary, this type of atmosphere heightened his sensitivities.Fighting had already broken out throughout the hall. The sound of slaughter and clashing weapons rang out alongside hurried, changing footsteps and low, heavy breathing.There was also the sound of crunching and something shooting through the air.The entire great hall was in chaos, plunged into incomparable peril. It was enough to make one\u2019s heart jump.Clang!Suddenly, Su Yi shook his wrist, and Mortal Edge shot from its bamboo sheath. With a flash of cold light, he stabbed each of the ten or more Ghoul Worms hurtling towards him. Their bodies burst into pieces and scattered.Guo Bing broke out into cold sweats.He hadn\u2019t sensed this sudden, impending danger in the slightest!The ominous winds howled, repeatedly slamming the main gates. An unknowable number of Ghoul Worms surged into the building, riding the bone-chillingly cold air currents.The battle continued.Su Yi just stood there. Every time he sensed impending danger, Mortal Edge struck as if it had eyes of its own, slaying the worms with impeccable accuracy. It didn\u2019t miss, not even once. Su Yi seemed perfectly relaxed.This was enormously reassuring for Guo Bing, whose heart gradually calmed down. Before long, he wasn\u2019t nearly as panicked.Fifteen minutes later.The piercing sound of a bone flute rang out in the rain and darkness outside the hall.It acted like a signal. The sinister winds instantly ceased their rampage, and the remaining Ghoul Worms reacted as if they\u2019d been summoned, all of them rushing outside.\u201cDon\u2019t chase them! Start a fire first!\u201d Amidst the darkness, Uncle Yong called out, his voice like iron.Before long, they\u2019d lit a new campfire, its warm glow dispelling the darkness.When they recovered their field of view, they saw that the interior of the hall was covered in rubble. Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the other guards stood protectively around the young woman. Without exception, their expressions were grave and fearful.The corpses of countless black worms littered the floor.Su Yi looked around, then said to Guo Bing, \u201cWe\u2019re safe for now.\u201dBut suddenly, Uncle Yong\u2019s expression shifted, and he dashed out of the hall.\u00a0When he returned, his expression was unsightly. \u201cMiss, Hu Jiu and Zhang Tong have been murdered.\u201dThey were the two he\u2019d first assigned to stand guard outside the main gate.But when Uncle Yong went outside to check up on them, they were already lying on the ground, dead, more than half of their flesh devoured. The sight was brutal and terrifying.The uniformed girl\u2019s eyes were wide, and the blood drained from her pretty face.\u00a0In all her years of life, she\u2019d never seen anything so brutal before. For a moment, the combination of rage and grief left her at a complete loss.\u201cMiss, to martial artists like us, life and death are commonplace. There\u2019s no need to be overly upset.\u201d Uncle Yong walked up to her and said gently, \u201cYour father agreed to let me lead you here because he wanted you to experience more of the world. Only then can you truly mature.\u201dThe girl seemed somewhat dejected. She sighed, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think anyone would die on this expedition.\u201d\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Su Yi suddenly interjected. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, this night won\u2019t be at all peaceful. The task at hand is preparing for battle. We don\u2019t have time for grief.\u201d\u201cWhat does my business have to do with you?\u201d snapped the girl. \u201cIn the battle just now, you didn\u2019t seem so skilled! On the contrary, you hid faster than any of us!\u201dUncle Yong whispered, \u201cMiss, he\u2019s right. It\u2019s highly likely that we\u2019ll face brutal combat soon.\u201dHis expression was grave. It seemed he\u2019d sensed how perilous their situation was too.The girl\u2019s expression shifted. \u201cWill anyone else die?\u201dUncle Yong was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to let anything like that happen again.\u201dShe fell silent for a moment. She trusted Uncle Yong more than anyone else here. For even him to say that, just how perilous would this night be?It was then that Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up, and he glanced outside the hall.\u00a0What he saw was\u2014A figure strolling leisurely through the temple\u2019s main gates.\u00a0Despite the darkness and pouring rain, he seemed confident and utterly at ease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Exorcising Mountain Ghosts with a Folding Fan, the Unhindered Heavenly Frost SwordThe rain poured down in buckets, and the night was dark as ink, yet someone was leisurely strolling about the run-down temple!This unusual, unsettling scene immediately put Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the other guards on edge. They readied their weapons, instantly on high alert.As the figure drew near, Su Yi and the others finally saw their appearance clearly.He was a man in cloud-patterned long boots, his eyebrows dark as ink and his hair bound up in a crest. He had a straight nose and held a folding fan.He was handsome, his jade robes tight-cut and form-fitting, like a dandy young nobleman. Every inch of him emanated elegance.The uniformed girl was stunned. She muttered subconsciously, \u201cThat guy\u2019s really pretty!\u201dUsing the word \u201cpretty\u201d to describe a man seemed a bit inappropriate, but she couldn\u2019t think of a better way to describe him.\u201cCareful, Miss. Whoever he is, he\u2019s not simple.\u201d\u00a0Uncle Yong reacted as if a powerful foe had arrived. His expression went solemn, his gaze sharp as a knife. He stared intently at the elegant young lord drawing closer and closer to the hall.\u201cThis is an abandoned temple in the wilderness, a place where ghosts run rampant. You\u2019d best go back from whence you came, Young Lord. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame us for our poor manners!\u201d shouted one of the guards. His words were harsh and threatening, but also probing.The young lord stopped about thirty feet from the gates, playing with his folding fan. He said in a carefree tone, \u201cPoor manners? Heh heh, if I hadn\u2019t taken pity on you earlier, I\u2019m afraid the ghoul worms would have devoured you by now. You\u2019d be nothing but rancid empty skins already.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Everyone visibly started, waves coursing through their hearts.\u201cAre you a member of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate?\u201d asked Uncle Yong solemnly.\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. Those Deathbringer\u2019s Gate guys are just flunkies I took under my wing, that\u2019s all.\u201d The young lord shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m here to see you for much the same reason. So long as you acknowledge me as your master and pledge your loyalty to me, you can live on.\u201dHe stood amidst the downpour, but an invisible force seemed to disperse the rain before it hit him. His clothes weren\u2019t the least bit damp, and he didn\u2019t look at all bedraggled. On the contrary, he emanated an incomparably mysterious air.\u201cAcknowledge you as your master? Who the hell do you think you are? What gives you the right to speak with such arrogance?\u201d the girl in military attire snorted.\u201cWhen you pledge allegiance to me, you\u2019ll naturally learn who I am.\u201d The young lord smiled as he looked at her.Then, for the first time, all of them saw the young man\u2019s bloody red, faintly lustrous pupils. They shone like crimson moons, eerie and terrifying.The girl\u2019s heart shook. Her eyes went blank, and she suddenly drew her sword and held it at the ready.Uncle Yong reacted quickly, pushing down on her shoulder and saying in a voice that boomed like spring thunder, \u201cMiss, hurry and clear your head!\u201dEvery word boomed like thunder, echoing throughout the skies and sweeping away the unsettling atmosphere. Even the stone tiles shook.The girl felt a buzzing in her ears as she suddenly regained mental clarity.When she next looked at the beautiful but unnatural young lord, her gaze carried a hint of newfound terror, and her pretty face was noticeably paler than before.Just now, she\u2019d been in a daze, as if struck by some demonic magic. She\u2019d completely lost her awareness!\u201cOh? A peak Qi Accumulation Realm martial artist. That body of yours is actually quite well trained.\u201d The young lord looked Uncle Yong up and down appreciatively, with the air of someone choosing goods from a store. It was deeply uncomfortable.\u201cSo, \u2018Your Excellency\u2019, what will you do if we refuse? Will you use force?\u201d Uncle Yong took a deep breath, and his aura expanded, like signal fires billowing into the skies. Even his voice boomed like thunder, every word carrying terrifying force.This was a martial artist at the peak of the Qi Accumulation Realm: blood and qi like signal flares, forceful as thunder!Were an ordinary yin soul to see this, it would be no different than if they\u2019d seen the sun; the soaring power of his blood and qi would exterminate them where they stood.But the young lord didn\u2019t seem to care in the least. He said, \u201cI came here to give you a chance at life, so I urge you to treasure it. Otherwise, once I attack\u2026.\u201dHis blood-colored eyes narrowed, and his gaze swept across the group before he said, \u201cI guarantee that not one of you will leave this place alive.\u201dHis words were casual, yet utterly scornful and confident.The guards\u2019 hearts sank, their expressions noticeably more solemn.\u201cAll of you, protect the young miss!\u201d Uncle Yong took a deep breath, then stepped forth.In that instant, he was like a saber leaving its sheath. His bones cracked like booming thunder, and his energy surged, roaring like the currents of the Yangtze River.Clang!Uncle Yong drew his saber with explosive force.The force cut right through the downpour, dispersing the nearby raindrops. Countless beads of water burst into mist. As the water scattered, Uncle Yong shot forward like lightning.His fierce bravery left the girl and the other guards stunned.Only Su Yi silently shook his head.They then watched as the young lord stood in place. He casually\u00a0waved his\u00a0fan.Clang!The heaven-shaking sound of a collision rang out. The folding fan effortlessly blocked Uncle Yong\u2019s enraged attack. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t move it even a hair.\u201cYou\u2019re no good.\u201d The young lord shook his head, then raised his fan.Uncle Yong felt an abundant cold yin energy course through the fan and into his saber, like a limitless chill slamming into him. The webbing of his hand shook, and he staggered several steps back.His saber almost flew from his hand.Bang! Bang! Bang!With every step he retreated, the stone tiles beneath his feet split and shattered, stirring up smoke and dust.It was easy to imagine just how terrifying the strike Uncle Yong had just endured was. The uniformed girl and the guards were rooted to the spot, their hearts quivering.\u00a0How could that young lord be so terrifying?It\u2019s worth noting that Uncle Yong was the strongest member of their party. Throughout the nineteen cities of Cloudriver Prefecture, he was a peak expert, second only to Grandmasters!Yet now, a young man had sent him staggering back with a casual, understated swing of a folding fan!\u201cThe Grandmaster Realm!?\u201d Uncle Yong\u2019s expression was unsightly. He was completely stunned.\u201cA Grandmaster?\u201d The young lord paused, thought, then said, \u201cSomeone of that level can barely even put up a fight against me. I only just dealt with an old man of that level. Alas, he escaped in the end\u2026..\u201dHis voice carried a thread of regret.The group\u2019s heart\u2019s clenched. They felt as if they\u2019d plunged into an icy abyss.Even Grandmasters are no match for this young lord?Who is he? Why has he hidden himself away in a haunted place like Mother Ghost Ridge?But Su Yi\u2019s expression seemed to say, \u201cIndeed, just as I suspected!\u201d From the look of him, he\u2019d long since seen through their opponent\u2019s secrets.The young lord glances at the skies, then\u00a0let\u00a0out a long sigh. It\u2019s getting late. I\u2019ll give you one last chance: submit, or die.\u201d\u201cUncle Yong, take this!\u201d The uniformed girl suddenly took out a silver longsword and tossed it to him.The sword was silvery with a frosty sheen, white and translucent like snow. It was engraved with obscure, distorted symbols and cloud patterns, as bright as moonlit snow.\u201cAn Origin Talisman Weapon!\u201d Surprise flashed across Su Yi\u2019s face. He immediately recognized this sword\u2019s extraordinariness.This blade was forged of spiritual materials. It was a true blue spiritual weapon.But unlike ordinary spiritual weapons, an Origin Dao cultivator had carved markings into the blade, giving it the power of a talisman or formation array. Its uses far exceeded ordinary spiritual weapons.Thus, such weapons were known as \u201cOrigin Talisman Weapons.\u201dIn the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, such weapons weren\u2019t particularly rare, but in the spiritually-barren Great Zhou, this was absolutely a top-class divine weapon! For the girl in military uniform to carry such an object on her person only made it increasingly obvious that her background was extraordinary.With this sword in hand, Uncle Yong grew noticeably calmer, and he emanated an air of great confidence. His eyes blazed with a hint of intensity as he stared at the weapon.The sword was called \u201cHeavenly Frost,\u201d and it was a gift from an Earthly ImmortalWhen the young lord saw it, his unnatural, blood-red eyes flickered with a hint of dread. He\u2019d clearly picked up on how extraordinary this weapon was. He struck without any further hesitation.Whoosh!He lunged forward, practically flying. His fan opened, revealing the image of eighteen mountain ghosts. Black light surged, and murderous energy billowed forth.As he raised his hand, eighteen streams of black smoke emerged, transforming into eighteen vicious ghosts. Their murderous intent spread, blotting out the skies.It was as if they\u2019d been plunged into an infinite hellscape. Ghostly wailing and unearthly howls echoed throughout the air.Uncle Yong held the Heavenly Frost Sword aloft, its blade flashing a dazzling silver, like flowing mercury or pouring moonlight.He swung, sending arcs of sword light. Without exception, every vicious ghost that drew near writhed as if they\u2019d been set on fire. Wounds burst open on their bodies, and a bloody smell permeated the air as they let out agonized howls.But beneath the young lord\u2019s control, the eighteen vicious ghosts didn\u2019t retreat at all. They just charged ahead like fiends, lunging at Uncle Yong with no regard for anything else.In a breath of time, Uncle Yong was surrounded. As dazzling as the Heavenly Frost Sword was, he couldn\u2019t kill so many apparitions so quickly.The young lord then seized this opportunity to leap up. He avoided the sword energy with the utmost caution; it seemed he dared not clash with it head-on.When he locked onto his target, he slashed his folding fan against the sword.Clang!The resulting clash was enough to split stone or pierce metal.Uncle Yong trembled, the Heavenly Frost Sword shaking so violently that he almost lost his grip on it.There was no way he\u2019d miss that his foe had set his sights on the Heavenly Frost Sword!He gnashed his teeth and endured that terrifying power, then tightened his grip. He rallied all the power of his Martial Dao and fought with all his might.In just a few breaths of time, he slaughtered three vicious ghosts. The sword light had sliced and injured the others, dispersing their malevolent energies and leaving them heavily wounded.The young lord snorted coldly, then shot forward in a flash, aiming for the girl in military uniform standing near the gateway.\u201cCrap!\u201d Uncle Yong immediately sensed something was wrong, shouting, \u201cHurry and use your Godshadow Crossbows! Don\u2019t let him get any closer!\u201dThe guards near the young woman didn\u2019t hesitate. They each immediately drew distinctive-looking crossbows, then placed sharp-edged bolts against the bows\u2019 taut strings.Godshadow Crossbows!These were the highest-class crossbows available to the armies of the Great Zhou. They included abstruse iron bolts, and when fired, they had enough force to kill ordinary Qi Accumulation martial artists.If they were surrounded, even Martial Dao Grandmasters would suffer grievous injuries.\u00a0Of course, Grandmasters wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to just stand there and let themselves be surrounded\u2026.Godshadow Crossbows were powerfully destructive, but their lifespans were short. After firing just thirty bolts, they\u2019d become nothing but scrap metal.But even so, a single Godshadow Crossbow was worth over ten thousand taels of silver. If you included the cost of the abstruse iron bolts, the price was even higher.It\u2019s worth noting that the method of crafting and using these crossbows was under the strict control of one of the Great Zhou\u2019s nine non-Zhou, \u201coutside-surnamed\u201d kings, \u201cThe Sea-Swallowing King.\u201d They were rarely made available to the public.Any faction capable of obtaining one was certain to have a powerful background and deep roots!Twang! Twang! Twang!As the guards pulled the triggers, a dense rain of crossbow bolts shot forth with an ear-splitting wail. Every last one of them was aimed directly at the young lord.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - A Deity Holding the Sun Aloft, Illuminating the Mortal WorldThe crossbow bolts shot through the air, piercing through the rain and darkness, tearing up the surrounding space and glinting with terrifyingly cold, sharp light.The dense volley of arrows shared a single target, like a concentrated downpour. There was no escape!But the young lord didn\u2019t try to escape.His clothes rustled, and he waved his folding fan repeatedly in the air.Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!The crossbows, each of which was strong enough to bore a hole through a wall, snapped in mid-air, shattering into pieces.Although the first round of bolts slowed the young lord\u2019s approach, he quickly reduced them to nothing but metal fragments.They broke as easily as rotting wood!Upon witnessing this unbelievable sight, the armored girl and the guards\u2019 expressions shifted.This was their first time witnessing someone break through the concentrated joint attack of so many Godshadow Crossbows so easily!But the guards were well-trained. Despite their shock, their movements didn\u2019t slow down, and they fired yet another volley of explosive attacks.The young lord\u2019s clothes billowed as he stood there, his bearing forceful as he easily shattered their attempts to stop his approach.But his brow still furrowed.This was because the concentrated volley of arrows was influencing the speed of his approach.Before he could draw any closer, a third round came flying straight towards him.\u201cHmph!\u201d He snorted coldly, his handsome features suddenly dark and murderous. Wisps of bloody light blazed in his eerie, bright red eyes.A hoarse, low whistle left his lips, spreading through the downpour.Sinister winds gathered, shaking everything around them.In response to his call, one swarm of Ghoul Worms after another flew in on the howling winds, hurtling towards the uniformed girl and her guards.\u201cThis is bad!\u201d Their expressions shifted.Each individual Ghoul Worm was only about the size of a human thumb. Against opponents like this, there was only one option left to them\u2014They cast aside their Godshadow Crossbows, took out their blades, and slashed at the worms.But this was no different from giving the young lord an opportunity to approach.They could neither advance nor retreat!\u201cProtect the young miss! I\u2019ll deal with him!\u201d Uncle Yong charged explosively from a distance.His blood and qi blazed as if they were on fire. He attacked valiantly, his hands gripping the radiant Heavenly Frost Sword. Murderous intent billowed around him, and his energy pierced right through the downpour.The young lord furrowed his brow.Of the eighteen vicious ghosts he\u2019d just unleashed, only six remained, all of them grievously wounded.But when he saw Uncle Yong\u2019s wounds, his red eyes flashed with unconcealed disdain.There was no way he\u2019d miss that Uncle Yong was fighting with his life on the line. This was no different from killing a thousand enemies, only to lose eight hundred of your own troops in the process!`\u201cFine. If you\u2019re seeking death, I don\u2019t mind sending you on your way. It\u2019s just a pity about that lovely skin of yours\u2026.\u201d The young lord sighed.Swoosh!He suddenly turned. As he fluttered his fan, streak after streak of malevolent, ghostly energy surged forth, like countless knives.He clearly wasn\u2019t holding back anymore. This time, he struck to kill.Dark, baleful energy surged, like a current of countless sharp blades, wreaking havoc in the rain and darkness.Uncle Yong attacked fearlessly with his sword, but he was well aware of just how dangerous their situation was!Their opponent was too terrifying; he was on par with a Grandmaster, or perhaps even stronger!Furthermore, there were still four vicious ghosts remaining, and they fought like mad, with no regard for their own safety. If not for the Heavenly Frost Sword, he couldn\u2019t possibly have held out this long.What worried him even further was that the girl and his companions were under attack too. Ghoul Worms had them surrounded. Even if he kept the young lord occupied, they had no chance to escape at all.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 We\u2019re really going to die here?\u201d Uncle Yong\u2019s heart filled with indescribable bitterness.At the end of the day, he\u2019d been overly confident. He\u2019d assumed that his peak Qi Accumulation cultivation was enough to fight any ghosts or goblins haunting Mother Ghost Ridge.Who would have thought that, so soon after entering the mountains, he\u2019d encounter such a limitlessly powerful foe?Rumble!The skies darkened, as if night had fallen. Fierce winds ran rampant.The dilapidated temple was now a battlefield of asuras, their combat shaking the heavens.With so many people to protect her, the uniformed girl had nothing to worry about, at least for now.But even so, her pretty face was deathly pale, her panic and terror written on her face.She\u2019d grown up in the lap of luxury.But even if her status were loftier, she was still just a sixteen-year-old girl. When had she ever experienced such violence and bloodshed?Especially since their current predicament wasn\u2019t just perilous; it was eerie and terrifying. This was a haunting; conflict with ghosts was nothing like ordinary combat between martial artists!The girl\u2019s mind went blank. She didn\u2019t know what to do.Even if they wanted to run now, it was too late!\u201cDon\u2019t tell me we\u2019re all going to die here\u2026?\u201d The girl\u2019s expression was bleak. She felt overcome with indescribable regret.She was the one who insisted on visiting Mother Ghost Ridge. Her goal was simple; she was after a certain spiritual medicine, which she planned to give her father as a birthday present. Who would have thought that in doing so, they\u2019d run the risk of total annihilation?If she\u2019d known it would be like this\u2026.It was then that she caught a glimpse of a tall figure out of the corner of her eye.She was stunned, and she subconsciously asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cKill the enemy,\u201d said Su Yi offhandedly.\u201cAre you insane? Don\u2019t make trouble, okay? You\u2019re still so arrogant and opinionated even now!? Can you please just not make this even worse?\u201d The girl shouted.Su Yi had been getting on her nerves this entire time. Now, all of her accumulated anger and displeasure erupted. Her panic and helplessness transformed into rage and burst forth.The nearby guards, who were engaged in vicious slaughter with the Ghoul Worms, had unsightly expressions too.One of them directly called out, \u201cYoung Miss, never mind him. I never liked the look of him anyway. If he wants to get himself killed, let him!\u201dGuo Bing was frantic, his expression overwrought with concern. \u201cSir, hurry! Come back!\u201d\u201cThis particular prey is the reason I came to Mother Ghost Ridge in the first place,\u201d said Su Yi flatly.With that, beneath their indignant, disbelieving gazes, he walked outside.Although no one noticed it, as Su Yi passed, the nearby Ghoul Worms retreated, not daring to draw near. He encountered no obstacles in his path!Meanwhile, Uncle Yong\u2019s plight was already incomparably perilous.He\u2019d already slaughtered the four remaining vicious ghosts, but he\u2019d paid a heavy price to do so. Malevolent yin qi was already corroding his body, and his skin was stained black and blue.And when he clashed with that young lord, the shock of their collisions left him hacking up blood. The power of his Martial Dao was like a candle flickering the wind.The young lord\u2019s attacks were swift and ferocious, his beautiful yet eerie face cold and murderous. He waved his folding fan, his killing intent like a blade slicing apart the very air itself. He was terrifying!But he wasn\u2019t going all out; he resembled a cat playing with a mouse. His icy, blood-colored eyes carried amusement and disdain.If not for his dread of the Heavenly Frost Sword, defeating someone on Uncle Yong\u2019s level would have been as easy as turning over his fist.Uncle Yong sighed bleakly.He\u2019d wandered Cloudriver Prefecture unimpeded for decades, but against all expectations, it seemed highly likely he\u2019d perish here in Mother Ghost Ridge.The most ridiculous part was that even now, he couldn\u2019t determine his opponent\u2019s origins or cultivation\u2026.Fine. I\u2019ll just have to use this old life of mine to buy the\u00a0young miss a\u00a0chance at survival!\u00a0Suddenly, Uncle Yong\u2019s gaze filled with staunch determination.His body blazed like a furnace, shaking the air. His energy surged, baleful and resolute, instantly making him stronger.But before he could even go all out, the young lord laughed coldly. \u201cIs that the limit of your abilities?\u201dBoom!He shook his folding fan, and a bloody mist of murderous intent surged forth, as if all of heaven and earth had been plunged into the depths of winter. A bone-chilling, malevolent chill spread out. Throughout the surrounding area, both the pouring rain and the fallen dust froze solid.This was a mouthful of the Six-Yin Baleful Aura the young lord had cultivated. It was as cold as could be; a single breath could encase an entire river in ice, freezing and killing every living thing in its waters.Any mortal who drew near would freeze into an ice statue, and their life force would slip away!Uncle Yong was already nearing the end of his rope, and he\u2019d been caught off guard. No matter how desperately he swung his sword, the bloody, icy, baleful aura relentlessly invaded his body.He felt as if he\u2019d been plunged into an endless icy abyss. He froze, rooted to the spot, like a fish trapped in a layer of ice. He could no longer move a muscle.From a distance, his companions saw the bloody, baleful mist freeze around him. They could only dimly discern the weak flow of his blood and qi.\u201cUncle Yong!\u201d The girl shrieked in shock and panic.When the other guards saw Uncle Yong in peril, it was as if they\u2019d been struck by lightning. Uncle Yong was the strongest among them. If he fell here, who among them was worthy of being that young lord\u2019s opponent?We\u2019re finished\u2026.\u00a0Uncle Yong wasn\u2019t dead yet, but he could feel the end coming for him.He despaired, and was just about to give up all resistance when he saw someone draw near.Wait!What\u2019s that Su Yi kid doing, rushing out here?Uncle Yong\u2019s impression of Su Yi wasn\u2019t exactly \u201cgood.\u201d He thought Su Yi ridiculously haughty and contemptuous.He wouldn\u2019t have guessed that at a time like this, the boy would risk his life like this. Although he seemed like a moth throwing himself into the flames, this fearlessness in the face of death left Uncle Yong moved.This kid\u2026. He\u2019s not so bad after all!It\u2019s just a shame that courage alone isn\u2019t enough to turn this situation around\u2026Su Yi had already walked over. He looked at the nearby young lord and said calmly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed that a mere\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse like you would achieve sentience or use human skins to cultivate. Alas, your vicious nature remains. You\u2019ve yet to truly refine your natural murderous yin energy, so this is your limit.\u201dThe young lord froze, then whipped around, his bright red eyes staring at Su Yi in surprise. \u201cHow did you tell?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in no mood to explain that to an evil creature like you.\u201d Su Yi shook his head. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give you a chance. If you get down on your knees and beg for mercy, I\u2019ll grant you a painless death.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026. You want me to get down on my knees and beg?\u201d The young lord\u2019s expression was strange, as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe a mere youth had said such a thing to him.Su Yi shook his head and sighed.As expected, an evil creature like this had no powers of discernment.He no longer hesitated. He waved his sleeves, and eighteen streaks of green appeared. They revolved smoothly through the air. Upon closer inspection, they were bamboo talismans, their green surfaces lustrous and carved with mysterious symbols.Every last bamboo talisman fired a dazzlingly bright illusory sword, They intercrossed and gathered in the air, condensing into a single streak of jade-green sword light.The sword light was as radiant as a miniature green sun. It hung in the air, a full three feet across, with fluctuating wormlike patterns shifting around its surface. It emanated an aura as lofty as the skies and intangible as the workings of fate.Its appearance lit up the rain and darkness, its radiance piercing the eyes, like a sun rising from the darkness of the Netherworld.Su Yi stuck out his form and grabbed the air. The green sword light fell directly into his palm.He looked like a god carrying the sun, its light so dazzling, it could illuminate the entire human world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - A Sword to Cut Mountains and Seas, Trouble PassesIt was dark and pouring rain, yet a sun had appeared out of nowhere. What was going on?The uniformed girl and her guards had already given into despair when they felt something prick at their eyes, and the chill pervading their bodies dispersed. Warmth returned for what seemed like the first time in a long time.Afterward, they saw Su Yi holding a ball of green sword light. All of them\u00a0stared, eyes wide, as if they\u2019d just witnessed a divinity descending to the mortal world!Kssh! Kssh! Kssh!The Ghoul Worms surrounding the girl and her guards disappeared, like snow melting into water. Their bodies turned into black smoke and disappeared.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Uncle Yong was already nearing his limit when felt the baleful chill freezing his blood quickly disperse. He felt like a man on the verge of drowning when someone suddenly pulled him onto the shore: delighted, but also confused.When he saw Su Yi, he couldn\u2019t help but feel stunned.The blue-robed youth seemed like an entirely different person. His sword seemed to look down on the entire world, his bearing unique, with the deportment of a divinity!At the same time\u2014The young lord\u2019s expression changed completely; he\u2019d sensed the danger.Especially facing the sword light in Su Yi\u2019s hand. He felt a painful, burning, pricking sensation all over his skin.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed I\u2019d run into a tough one this time!\u201d The young lord roared, his gaze vicious as he swung his fan.Boom!A current of chilling, blood-colored malevolent energy many times stronger than before surged towards Su Yi, like floodwaters breaking through a dam.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to tell you that I prepared this sword with you in mind!\u201d\u00a0Su Yi then gently tapped the green sword light, and a clear, impassioned sword hum reverberated throughout the vastness of heaven and earth.His gaze was calm as his clothes fluttered about. He strode forward, the green sword light waving back and forth.It instantly sliced through the air, creating an arc of indomitable sword light and piercing through the curtain of rain. It tore open the night skies with a momentum that threatened to cleave everything in its path.With my sword, I split mountains and seas. My troubles recede like the tides.This was the Rejoicing Sword\u2019s \u201cSplitting Mountains and Seas\u201d!There was no way to describe this strike\u2019s power.When Su Yi slashed, his sword seemed capable of splitting open a hundred thousand tall mountains, or of dividing the endless blue seas. Nothing could stand in its way!The onlookers saw nothing but a streak of sword light cleaving through heaven and earth, piercing everything in its wake.Wherever it passed, it easily penetrated the currents of overflowing, blood-colored, malevolent energies. It ripped open the skies, cleaving directly into the young lord.How powerful was the young lord? He wasn\u2019t even afraid of Martial Dao Grandmasters!But as this slash drew close, it was as if he\u2019d encountered his natural enemy; he was scared out of his wits. It was too late to even dodge!The sword light was like a sun blotting out the skies. It was omnipresent, and as it reached the young lord\u2019s body, it passed through him as easily as a knife through canvas, easily cleaving him in half.\u201cNo\u2014\u2014!\u201d The young lord let out a desperate, agonized howl.Then, his body split in two, right down the center, like two perfect mirror images. Both halves thudded to the ground.The young lord who\u2019d once disdained Grandmasters, who\u2019d once pushed a peak Qi Accumulation martial artist to the brink of despair, had fallen beneath a single sword, his body split in two.The power of this single swing was like that of a god or immortal!\u201cThat\u2026. is this level of power even possible in the Blood Circulation Realm?\u201d The guards were rooted to the spot, especially one, who couldn\u2019t help but cry out.\u201cI never would have thought that I was the blind one. I completely overlooked the expert standing right in front of me\u2026.\u201d Uncle Yong had already recovered a bit of his power. This scene stunned him too. His heart was in turmoil, his expression complicated. There was disbelief, shock, as well as shame\u2026.Could our Wen Family\u2019s son-in-law\u2026. Could he be an immortal of legend?\u00a0Guo Bing was stunned senseless. This one thought replayed through this mind.The girl in military attire stared intently at Su Yi, waves coursing through her heart. She\u2019d never felt so conflicted, nor so out of control of the situation.She\u2019d experienced all sorts of emotional ups and downs todayThere was the excitement of disposing of a villain of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate, her rage at Su Yi\u2019s disdainful attitude, her sadness and grief over her fallen guards, her despair and terror at this sudden crisis\u2026..It was as if all the surging emotions she\u2019d accumulated up until this point had been sliced in two; as Su Yi swung his sword, her emotions seemed to burst within her chest. Immediately afterward, delight, bewilderment, and disbelief coursed through her like a tidal wave.Her mind went entirely blank. All she could do was stand there, staring at the young man in blue, the youth reminiscent of a banished immortal. A long time passed before she regained her senses.Whoosh~!At the same time, Su Yi let out a breath of turbid air.That single streak of sword light was built on the foundation of the bamboo talismans he\u2019d inscribed the night before. He called it \u201cthe Great Evil-Burning Sun Formation.\u201dThis formation wasn\u2019t all that special, but it certainly wasn\u2019t something Martial Dao cultivators could create, not on their own.It was precisely due to his insufficient cultivation that he\u2019d made this set of talismans. He\u2019d held nothing back, even using a brand originating from the Sword of the Nine Hells and infusing it into the talismans. This allowed him to complete the formation, but only just barely.Furthermore, at his current cultivation, just activating the formation was an enormous expenditure.He was overdrawn; he\u2019d used up practically all the energy he had, and even his soul showed signs of weakness.If I were even just in the Qi Accumulation Realm, this might not have been such a strain\u2026.\u00a0Su Yi inwardly mocked himself.In his past life, there wouldn\u2019t have been any need for the Great Evil-Burning Sun Formation. All he\u2019d need was his \u201cSplitting Mountains and Seas\u201d attack. That alone was once enough to wipe out experts of the Imperial Realm!Never mind a petty, insignificant, unaccomplished\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse.Su Yi took out the Bluejade Bamboo Shoot, which he\u2019d prepared in advance, then swallowed it in a few bites. When he felt its abundant energy circulating through his depleted body, he sighed in relief, then glanced at the fallen corpse.The young lord had been cleaved in two. Dense, pitch-black blood poured from both halves, the stench rancid and irritating to the nostrils.Upon closer inspection, the young lord\u2019s handsome skin was loose and starting to split. Beneath it was a long-rotted corpse!In other words, the handsome face the corpse had on display earlier was nothing but a skin he\u2019d draped over himself.Uncle Yong suddenly seemed to recover from his shock. He hurried over and clasped his fist. \u201cMystic Master, thank you for saving us. I will remember this benevolence for the rest of my life. Should you need anything from me going forward, know that I won\u2019t refuse any request!\u201dHis expression was filled with respect and gratitude. An expert of his level could naturally tell that a youth like Su Yi was no ordinary martial artist!Furthermore, with one swing of his blade, Su Yi had stemmed the raging tide, saving all of them from certain doom. Thus, facing him now, Uncle Yong\u2019s every word came straight from the heart. His gratitude was more than mere words could express.It was no exaggeration to say that Su Yi\u2019s single attack was enough to convince even Martial Dao Grandmasters to lower their heads!Uncle Yong might be a peak Qi Accumulation Realm expert, but now,\u00a0even he\u00a0lowered his head and called Su Yi \u201cMystic Master!\u201dSeeing this, the other guards frantically expressed their gratitude as well.\u201cMystic Master, thank you for saving our lives! We\u2019ll remember this gratitude for the rest of our lives!\u201dBut in their hearts, they couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous.\u00a0From the moment they first met him in Guangling City, and even after entering Mother Ghost Ridge, they\u2019d excluded and disdained him on numerous occasions.Many of them had even considered stepping in to teach him a lesson.Facing him now, after watching him slay the \u201cyoung lord\u201d in a single attack, how could they\u00a0not\u00a0be nervous?Even someone as strong as Uncle Yong had acknowledged Su Yi\u2019s strength and lowered his head. He\u2019d called him \u201cMystic Master\u201d, hadn\u2019t he?\u201cSir\u2026 Are you\u2026. Are you\u00a0really an immortal?\u201d Guo Bing approached, quivering and recoiling, but his gaze was incomparably passionate, like an ordinary man upon seeing an immortal of legend.\u201cI\u2019m nothing of the sort,\u201d said Su Yi. As he spoke, his gaze swept across Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the others. He said flatly, \u201cI came to Mother Ghost Ridge specifically in search of this particular prey. I just happened to save you while I was at it, so there\u2019s no need to be so polite.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t saying that out of good manners.When he decided to visit Mother Ghost Ridge, he predicted that if he searched for the Six Yin Grass or Extreme Yang Flowers, it was highly likely that he\u2019d encounter the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse too.That was why he\u2019d spared no effort in inscribing those basic bamboo talismans. With them on hand, even if he encountered the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse, he\u2019d have enough cards up his sleeve to kill it.\u201cAh, Mystic Master, so you came here to slay this wicked creature.\u201d Uncle Yong finally understood. His expression was even more respectful than before.But although they didn\u2019t know it, as powerful and miraculous as that sword had looked, that was the power of talismans designed specifically to counter ghosts.Were Su Yi\u2019s target a human Martial Dao Grandmaster, the effect wouldn\u2019t have been nearly so pronounced.In short, that was a sword he\u2019d prepared specifically to kill the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse.But even if Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the guards knew that, they wouldn\u2019t have dared show the least bit of disrespect. After all, the profundity and power of that sword far exceeded the limits of their comprehension.\u201cIf you\u2019re so tough, why didn\u2019t you attack right away?\u201d Suddenly, the uniformed girl stormed over, her expression contorted with rage. \u201cIf you\u2019d done something a little earlier, how could Hu Jiu and Zhang Tong have been eaten by Ghoul Worms? How could Uncle Yong have come so close to death? How could we have remained so scared for so long?\u201dEveryone fell silent.In the face of this unreasonable string of questions, even a simple man like Guo Bing couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He couldn't help but say, \u201cMiss, you\u2019ve insulted and rejected our family\u2019s son-in-law at every turn, but he\u2019s never taken you to task for it. Now, he\u2019s even saved your life! It\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019re ungrateful. Don\u2019t you think interrogating him like this is a bit much?\u201dUncle Yong\u2019s expression had shifted dramatically too, and his heart shook.Young Miss, ah, Young Miss. That Su Yi is a terrifying limitlessly terrifying existence.\u00a0With the power at his disposal, he could destroy everyone present effortlessly. How can you be so disrespectful to him even after witnessing his strength?He suddenly stepped forward, his expression severe as he rebuked her. \u201cYoung Miss, wake up! We mistreated Mystic Master Su Yi earlier. We couldn\u2019t fault him even if he chose not to save us, yet he did so anyway out of the goodness of his heart. This is an enormous act of benevolence. How can we repay his kindness with enmity?\u201dHis words weren\u2019t the least bit polite; the girl in military uniform felt as if she\u2019d been slapped in the face. She stood there, dazed, for quite some time.This was the first time she\u2019d ever seen her Uncle Yong, who\u2019d always doted on her, lose his temper at her.This harshness felt incomparably strange and unfamiliar.She\u2019d enjoyed comfort and high status from a young age, and countless people doted on her. Add that to her exceptional appearance and renowned family background, and no matter where she went, she heard nothing but flattering words.She never would have guessed that Uncle Yong would scold her over a single sentence spoken out of turn!\u201cMiss, Mister Cheng is right. Whatever you do, don\u2019t let your anger overcome your rationality.\u201d The guards chimed in as well.Her disrespect had stunned them too, and they broke out in cold sweats, terrified that in a fit of rage, Su Yi would turn his sword on them. If he did, all of them would perish here.Uncle Yong was speaking up on Su Yi\u2019s behalf.\u00a0Even her guards were against her.At that moment, the girl felt as if she were all alone in the world. Different expressions flitted across her face, and she looked lost and bewildered.\u00a0Was I really wrong?A while later, she finally seemed to regain her mental clarity and rationality. She faced Su Yi and silently lowered her proud head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - A Three-Inch Jade, A Three-Foot WorldBeneath everyone\u2019s gazes, the girl said bitterly, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Just now, I was overly presumptuous\u2026\u201dThis was her first time lowering her head and apologizing like this. She felt conflicted about that, as well as a bit dazed.Was this the price of growing up?When he saw this, Uncle Yong sighed in relief, looking somewhat gratified.He then turned to Su Yi and said respectfully, \u201cMystic Master, everyone in the family has spoiled the young miss since she was a baby. She\u2019s never experienced wind or rain; a little recklessness is almost inevitable. I humbly request your forgiveness!\u201dThe other guards followed suit, each of them requesting his forgiveness.Su Yi merely glanced at the girl, but he said nothing. Instead, he went up to the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse and looked it over carefully.He\u2019d never planned to make things hard on the girl in the first place.It was just as he\u2019d said; he\u2019d come here for the purpose of killing the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse. He\u2019d just happened to save the girl and her guards while he was at it.\u00a0He\u00a0disdained demanding\u00a0their everlasting gratitude.When he saw this, Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the guards finally relaxed. They realized that Su Yi wasn\u2019t about to take the young miss to task over her poor manners.They weren\u2019t sure when, but the downpour had silently tapered off. The tense, dark clouds had dispersed. Light returned to what had been darkness mere moments before.\u00a0They could even dimly discern faint, rosy hues just over the horizon.Dusk was approaching.The floor of the dilapidated temple was already nothing but rubble, yet weeds flourished in its soil. The hall was a scene of both life and death, like the outline of a desolate, unbridled scroll painting.The uniformed girl and her guards returned to the hall to treat the wounded.Only Su Yi remained in the courtyard, examining the folding fan he\u2019d picked up from the ground.\u00a0Its edges and ribs were forged of a spiritual material, \u201cInk-Splattered Spirit Iron.\u201d The cloth was Blood Yin Silk, with crudely painted clouds and the outlines of eighteen mountain ghost totems.\u201cThis is most likely a product of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate. The craftsmanship is coarse and shoddy; it\u2019s not even worth looking at. What a waste of quality spiritual materials,\u201d said Su Yi with a hint of regret.The fan was heavily damaged, practically ruined. Otherwise, he could have extracted the materials and used them to make a decent sword.\u00a0He casually tossed it aside. Then, his gaze returned to the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse.But in the end, he found nothing.He couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brow.\u00a0The corpse had gained sentience, and he\u2019d even recruited several members of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate as his subordinates. It was highly likely that he\u2019d already plucked both the Six Yin Grass and the Extreme Yang Flowers. Su Yi couldn\u2019t even eliminate the possibility that the corpse had already gotten his hands on the inauspicious yin spirit vein.Yet there were no treasures of any kind on its corpse.Don\u2019t tell me this wicked creature has a nest somewhere out there, and that it\u2019s long since hidden its treasures inside?\u00a0Su Yi pondered for a moment, then took out a flame stick. Sparks fell into the dirt, and the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse\u2019s remains instantly burst into flame.Dense black smoke billowed into the air.Soon, the entire corpse was nothing but ash. Su Yi was just about to rejoin the others in the hall when his eyes lit up.He\u2019d just noticed a jade pendant amidst the ashes. It was about the size of a baby\u2019s fist, dark and non-reflective. It was extremely difficult to notice unless you were looking carefully.Su Yi immediately picked it up and examined it. Soon, he couldn\u2019t help but smile.The pendant was smooth to the touch, its surface carved with mountains and rivers. It was inky black, with a simple, stately elegance.More importantly, this was actually a storage treasure!According to Su Yi\u2019s memories of his current life, spatial treasures were incredibly rare within the Great Zhou\u2019s borders. Even some Grandmasters weren\u2019t fortunate enough to possess them.It wasn\u2019t that they were so expensive so much as that they were overly rare.Su Yi wouldn\u2019t have guessed\u00a0this\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse would possess a treasure of this caliber.After examining it briefly, Su Yi exerted strength through his fingers and brushed the inky black pendant\u2019s surface. This instantly dispersed the layer of weak seals protecting it.He sensed its interior, and discovered that the space inside was extremely narrow, only about three square feet. It was only barely enough to fit a large wooden chest.The storage space was already full of numerous items: scattered jade bottles, spiritual medicines, spirit stones, scrolls, etc.This was undoubtedly the sum total of the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse\u2019s possessions. Everything was here, including the Six Yin Grass and Extreme Yang Flowers Su Yi had come here in search of.However, he didn\u2019t find that inauspicious yin spirit vein. He wasn\u2019t sure if the corpse had already refined it, or if it were still hidden somewhere within Mother Ghost Ridge, undiscovered.Before long, Su Yi took inventory of his spoils: nine stalks of spiritual medicine: five tier-one, two tier-two, and three tier-three.It\u2019s worth noting that although the Six Yin Grass and Extreme Yang Flowers were both tier-three, they were prime supplements for Inner Furnace Realm cultivators, far beyond what normal tier-three spiritual medicines could compare with.It was for this reason that the Martial Dao Grandmaster, Xiao Tianque, had come here in search of Six Yin Grass.Aside from the spirit medicines, there were fifty-five spirit stones and about a dozen bottles of various types of cold yin medicines. Ghost cultivators used them to temper their abilities, but they weren\u2019t useful to Su Yi. Still, he could at least give them to Qing Wan.Finally, there was a scroll. It was made of leather, but it was so old and worn that its pages were yellowed.It described a secret cultivation method called the \u201cNine Devils Profound Yin Technique.\u201dAs impressive as the name sounded, after Su Yi flipped through it, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head in disappointment.This was nothing more than a \u201ccorpse refining\u201d technique, an aberrant branch of ghost cultivation.Even if you practiced it to its highest limit, you could at most \u201cborrow corpses to condense a body\u201d and \u201cundergo metamorphosis to become more\u00a0human-like.\u201d At best, you\u2019d barely be on par with an Origin Dao cultivator.It couldn\u2019t even begin to come close to the Ten Directions Asura Sutra he\u2019d given Qing Wan, and it wasn\u2019t worth so much as a second look.At my current level, my regular daily cultivation alone burns through a tier-one spiritual medicine. Even with all the herbs I acquired today, I\u2019ll at most be able to support my expenditures for another two weeks\u2026.But if I want to reach the pinnacle of \u2018Refining Bone\u2019, I\u2019m afraid half a month won\u2019t be enough.Going forward, I\u2019ll have to keep searching for spiritual medicines\u2026.But then, finding this dark jade pendant means I didn\u2019t make this journey in vain.He set those thoughts aside, then hung the pendant from his waist.With a storage treasure, he\u2019d have no need to drag around heavy luggage during his upcoming journeys.This was what pleased Su Yi the most.When it came to cultivation, he was confident that he was more diligent and assiduous than anyone.But when he wasn\u2019t cultivating, he was as lazy as could be. If he could leave something to other people, he would. He wouldn\u2019t so much as lift a finger if he didn\u2019t have to.Darkness spread, and night fell.The group lit a new campfire within the dilapidated great hall.When Su Yi walked back inside, Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the others hurriedly rose to greet him.\u201cMystic Master Su, it\u2019s already gotten late. We\u2019ve prepared a modest meal to express our gratitude. Please, take a seat.\u201d Uncle Yong invited him with a smile.Su Yi glanced at the fire and saw a sumptuous array of food and drink. Furthermore, they\u2019d cleared a wide, comfortable space, and it was obviously intended for him.\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d Su Yi wasn\u2019t the type to put on airs. He simply sat down and stretched.When he saw that everyone else was still standing, he casually ordered, \u201cSit down, all of you. No need to be reserved. I\u2019ve never cared about these sorts of details.\u201dOnly then did Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the others\u00a0smile\u00a0and\u00a0sit\u00a0down.From beginning to end, the armored girl looked as if her soul had left her body. Her head was lowered, her pretty face pallid, and she said nothing. It seemed she\u2019d yet to recover from her earlier shock.But she didn\u2019t have any of her former domineering, prideful temper, either.Su Yi certainly didn\u2019t care how she felt. He ate and drank as he pleased, ignoring her completely.When they saw Su Yi\u2019s disregard for the details, the guards gradually relaxed. They started toasting him and making small talk.\u00a0Su Yi didn\u2019t refuse, but he barely spoke, either.Even so, this level of amiability was a huge comfort to Uncle\u00a0Yong\u00a0and the rest of the guards.\u00a0They\u2019d been truly terrified that this mighty existence capable of cleaving a\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse directly in two would hold a grudge. If so, it would be a nightmare far greater than any of them could bear.Guo Bing was delighted too.Everything he\u2019d seen today had expanded his horizons. He was increasingly convinced that with Su Yi\u2019s abilities, he could easily cure the yin poison afflicting him.As they conversed, Uncle Yong no longer kept their origins a secret. Intentionally or unintentionally, he revealed their identities one by one, as well as the purpose of their expedition.Only now did Su Yi learn that they hailed from another of Cloudriver Prefecture\u2019s four peak-level factions, the Yuan Family.The girl in military attire was called Yuan Luoxi. She was the youngest daughter of Family Head Yuan Wutong, the apple of his eye and the pearl of the family. Everyone doted on her.Uncle Yong\u2019s full name was Cheng Wuyong. He was an elder, albeit one with an outside surname, and he\u2019d accompanied Yuan Luoxi as the leader of her guards.The guards were all elites with cultivations in the Blood Circulation\u2019s Refining Sinew or Refining Bone stages. They were valiant and capable on the battlefield.They\u2019d come to Mother Ghost Ridge in search of Six Yin Grass. Yuan Luoxi wanted to give it to her father, Yuan Wutong, as a birthday present.When he heard that, Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cHow did you learn that Six Yin Grass grew in Mother Ghost Ridge?\u201dHe\u2019d first heard from the Spiritjade Marchioness, Zi Jin, that almost no one in Cloudriver Prefecture knew that Six Yin Grass grew here.The uniformed girl, Yuan Luoxi, had sat there in silence throughout their conversation. This time, she spoke up. \u201cA little while ago, Grandpa Xiao visited our family home. He mentioned it in passing while discussing something with my father, and I secretly committed that information to memory.\u201dEven as she spoke, she hung her pretty head. She sounded dejected.\u201cXiao Tianque?\u201d asked Su Yi.Yuan Luoxi was briefly stunned. She finally raised her head, her pretty eyes blank. \u201cYou\u2026 Mystic Master, you know Grandpa Xiao too?\u201dEven the way she addressed him had changed.This was indirect proof that she now saw Su Yi in an entirely different light.\u201cOf course I know them. Not long ago, he led his granddaughter into Mother Ghost Ridge, only to suffer grave injuries at the hands of that\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse. If he hadn\u2019t bumped into me, I\u2019m afraid he would be long dead by now,\u201d said Su Yi casually.Cheng Wuyong and the other guards\u2019 visibly started.All of them were well aware of just how lofty Xiao\u00a0Tianque\u2019s\u00a0status was. When he visited the Yuan Family, the family head had personally gone out to greet him!Meanwhile, something seemed to occur to Yuan Luoxi, who blurted, \u201cMystic Master, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re that \u2018lofty expert\u2019 Grandpa Xiao told me about?\u201dThe way she looked at Su Yi had now changed completely. Her eyes brimmed with shock, disbelief, bewilderment, as well as a hint of awe.\u201cIf he was talking about the person who saved his life, yes. That was me,\u201d said Su Yi, but his thoughts were elsewhere.He\u2019d already understood. They\u2019d learned of the Six Yin Grass from Xiao Tianque. That was what prompted Yuan Luoxi and the others to undertake this expedition.Jaspaaar's ThoughtsAncient Chinese lighters looked like\u00a0this.\u00a0I wanted to call the thing a lighter, but it felt like an anachronism, so \u201cflame stick\u201d it is.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Trading Medicine for Medicine, the Five Stages of the Inner Furnace RealmThe skies grew darker and darker.Outside the ruined temple, the night was dark as ink, silent save for intermittent howls of distant wild beasts. Occasionally, strange, terrifying cries rang out, as if the ghosts were maliciously conversing amongst themselves.The campfire illuminated the great hall, the flames crackling audibly.When they got some unexpected answers out of Su Yi, Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but recall something Xiao Tianque had said to her father during his time as their guest.\u201cThat lofty expert looks young, but he has miraculous skill, like an\u00a0immortal of legend. He\u2019s beyond the comprehension of someone like me!\u201dAt the time, her father, Yuan Wutong, had been curious about this mysterious expert\u2019s identity too.But Xiao Tianque guarded the secret closely. He merely smiled, shook his head, and said no more on the subject.It was due to this very secretiveness that the \u201cmysterious expert\u201d who'd saved Xiao Tianque left such a deep impression on Yuan Luoxi.During their expedition to Guangling City, she actually planned to test her luck and see if she could find the expert Xiao Tianque respected so deeply.Who would have guessed that although she did in fact find him, she\u2019d only realize his identity after so many misunderstandings?For a while, Yuan Luoxi felt anguished and bitter.\u00a0For the first time in her life, she understood what people meant when they said \u201ctrue experts don\u2019t show off.\u201dShe suddenly rose, her hands crossed in front of her, then bowed low at the waist. \u201cMystic Master, I\u2026 I was wrong to blame you earlier. I\u2026.. I\u2019m willing to apologize, and no matter what compensation you require, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to obtain it for you. I just hope\u2026 I just hope you won\u2019t take offense at my earlier rudeness.\u201dHer tone was sincere, but she sounded a bit ill at ease.Cheng Wuyong and the others were stunned.\u00a0They\u2019d never seen their young miss apologize so solemnly to anyone. It was as if she were an entirely different person!When she sensed their surprise, Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but feel uncomfortable, as well as a bit embarrassed.\u00a0Do they really see me as someone who doesn't know how to apologize?Su Yi looked up at her and said, \u201cEarlier, you said you\u2019d root out the evildoers of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate to protect the populace. Your heart was in the right place; I\u2019ll let your poor manners slide on account of your good intentions. Sit down; no need to be so polite.\u201d\u201cThank you, Mystic Master.\u201d Yuan Luoxi was stunned. She wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the words she said back then would convince Su Yi not to pursue this matter.But when she thought of it, a thread of admiration rose within her heart.\u00a0Is this the magnanimity of a true expert?\u201cYoung Miss, if your father knew how you\u2019d changed today, he would surely be gratified,\u201d said Cheng Wuyong emotionally.It wasn\u2019t enough to speak of the ways of the world. People had to overcome wind and rain before they could truly change.The other guards nodded their agreement.Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but smile. She finally stopped sulking and said crisply, \u201cUncle Yong, let\u2019s begin our journey back as soon as we find the Six Yin Grass.\u201dSu Yi suddenly interjected, \u201cI already found the Six Yin Grass.\u201dYuan Luoxi was stunned. Then, she said tentatively, \u201cMystic Master\u2026 Might I ask if you\u2019d be willing to part with it? Would you possibly be willing to sell it to me?\u201dCheng Wuyong and the guards\u2019 hearts clenched for fear that Su Yi would misunderstand her intentions.But against all expectations, Su Yi nodded. \u201cI currently have no use for Six Yin Grass. If you\u2019re willing to offer thirty stalks of tier-one spirit medicine in exchange, this Six Yin Grass is yours.\u201dYuan Luoxi instantly lit up with delight. Without a second thought, she said, \u201cI can give you fifty stalks!\u201dCheng Wuyong instantly broke out in cold sweats. \u201cMiss, don\u2019t be rude. How could someone as lofty as the Mystic Master care about a few extra herbs?\u201dYuan Luoxi instantly reacted. She said apologetically, \u201cMystic Master, just now, I was overly excited, so I\u2026\u201dSu Yi waved. \u201cI understand.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but sigh inwardly.\u00a0This Cheng Wuyong guy has really let his imagination run wild. How does he know I don\u2019t care about a few extra stalks of medicine?He shook his head, then removed the Six Yin Grass from his pendant and handed it over.\u201cInner Furnace Grandmasters can use this spiritual medicine to refine their kidneys, but no matter what, your father must remember to take it slowly. He\u2019d be best off using medicines with blazing yang energy as a supplement. Otherwise, this \u2018medicine\u2019 will become a poison and hurt his foundations in the Martial Dao.\u201dInner Furnace cultivators refined the Five Major Organs: the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, which in turn corresponded to the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.The Inner Furnace Realm was thus split into five stages. Fully tempering one organ was called reaching \u201cthe first level of the Inner Furnace Realm.\u201dThe commonfolk referred to such experts as \u201cfirst-level Grandmasters.\u201dIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the five major organs didn\u2019t need to be refined in any specific order. Everyone could proceed in accordance with their own cultivation method.And Six Yin Grass, a tier-three spiritual medicine, could only achieve its full miraculous effect when used to refine the kidneys.Yuan Luoxi reached out and accepted the grass with both hands. \u201cThank you, Mystic Master!\u201dShe was grateful, but Cheng Wuyong and the guards were inwardly stunned.\u00a0As Su Yi gave her the herb, he casually instructed her on how best to use it. That was tantamount to guiding a Martial Dao Grandmaster\u2019s cultivation!The implications were huge; just thinking about it shook them to the core.And when Cheng Wuyong keenly picked up on the way Su Yi took the Six Yin Grass from the inky jade pendant at his waist, his eyelids twitched.A storage treasure!Those were treasures so rare that even many Martial Dao Grandmasters weren\u2019t fated to obtain them!There\u2019s no way Su Yi is just some live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family! His background can\u2019t be so simple.\u00a0Waves surged through Cheng Wuyong\u2019s heart. The more he learned about Su Yi, the less he could repress his awe.\u201cUncle Yong, do you have enough treasure on you?\u201dYuan Luoxi\u2019s question woke Cheng Wuyong from his daze and scattered thoughts.He took out his bag and rifled through it. He couldn\u2019t help but hesitate, \u201cI only have seventeen spiritual medicines. Twelve are tier one, while the other five are tier two.\u00a0Them aside, I have about seventy or eighty tier-one spirit stones and three tier-two spirit stones.\u201dWhen Su Yi heard that, he couldn\u2019t help but lament.\u00a0A major clan like the Yuan Family really is different. Guangling City\u2019s \u2018Three Great Clans\u2019 aren\u2019t even remotely comparable.A single guard\u2019s spiritual treasures were comparable to years of the entire Wen Family\u2019s accumulated wealth, and this was just what Cheng Wuyong happened to have on him!Yuan Luoxi asked softly, \u201cMystic Master, how about we convert the thirty tier-one medicines you requested into five tier-two medicines and twelve tier-one medicines instead?\u201dSu Yi nodded.In terms of actual value, tier-two spiritual medicines were far more expensive than tier-one medicines.Yuan Luoxi inwardly sighed in relief, and her eyes lit up. She was obviously delighted to have obtained the Six Yin Grass.Cheng Wuyong passed the spiritual medicines over. Su Yi then casually placed them into his black jade pendant.When they saw this, Yuan Luoxi and the guards were stunned too. They\u2019d finally noticed that Su Yi carried a storage treasure!Su Yi was rather pleased with this trade, too.He was still quite some distance from the Grandmaster Realm, so he truly had no practical use for a treasure like Six Yin Grass. That was why he traded it for tier-one and two spiritual medicines.If I add up all the spiritual medicine I have on me, it should be enough to last me until the peak of the Refining Bone stage,\u00a0he thought to himself.\u201cMystic Master, we plan to begin our return journey tomorrow at dawn. Might I ask when you plan to return?\u201d asked Cheng Wuyong.\u201cI want to go see the rest of Mother Ghost Ridge,\u201d said Su Yi. He\u2019d already risen to his feet.\u201cSir, are you planning to leave now?\u201d exclaimed Guo Bing.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll take advantage of the night and perhaps see things I might not encounter during the day.\u201d Su Yi nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s not proper! At night, Mother Ghost Ridge is incomparably perilous. You\u2026.\u201dBefore Guo Bing finished speaking, Su Yi smiled. \u201cThe ghosts ought to be afraid of me, not the other way around. Elder Guo, you should wait here with them. If I make it back by daybreak, we can all go back to the city together. Otherwise, you can head back without me.\u201dWith that, he gripped his bamboo staff and walked out of the hall. His slender, calm figure quickly disappeared into the darkness.Yuan Luoxi, Cheng Wuyong, and the guards looked at each other, but then, they weren\u2019t the least bit worried about Su Yi\u2019s safety.The Mystic Master killed even a\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse with a single swing of his sword. Which of Mother Ghost Ridge\u2019s remaining undead could possibly be his opponent?\u2026..The skies were dark as ink, and mists lingered around the mountains.Su Yi left the run-down temple, then gently tapped the Soul-Nourishing Gourd at his waist. \u201cQing Wan.\u201dWhoosh~!White smoke billowed from the mouth of the gourd, and a picture-perfect young beauty in a red dress drifted into view.In the time since she began cultivating the \u201cTen Directions Asura Sutra\u201d, Qing Wan had obviously undergone numerous minute transformations.First and foremost, her beautiful soul body was much more solid, and her skin was no longer ghastly pale or transparent. On the contrary, it seemed lustrous and pure as jade.Her beautiful phoenix eyes glinted with spirituality. Even just looking around, she inadvertently gave off a shocking charm.Add that to her pretty face, still soft with a hint of baby-fat, and a unique, somewhat contradictory temperament, and there was a hint of allure amidst her pure-hearted innocence.A blood-red dress, skin as fair as snow, pretty features, and distinctive charm. Even knowing she was a ghost, few men wouldn\u2019t be interested.Su Yi nodded to himself, pleased with what he saw.Qing Wan\u2019s talent and powers of comprehension were both extremely exceptional. She\u2019d changed so much already. He couldn\u2019t help but look forward to seeing just how far she\u2019d go in the future.Of course, to the likes of Su Xuanjun, who\u2019d seen all the beauties the world had to offer in his past life, the current Qing Wan was still lacking a certain something. She was still far from arousing his interest.After emerging from the gourd, Qing Wan\u2019s big eyes swept the surrounding area, and she said timidly, \u201cMystic Master, this is Mother Ghost Ridge, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just as scary as people say.\u201dHer voice was soft and pleasing to the ear.\u201c\u2018As scary as people say\u2019?\u00a0You\u2019re a ghost, not a person, you know.\u201d Su Yi corrected her, then continued, \u201cUse your perception to see where the yin energy is densest.\u201dHe didn\u2019t find the inauspicious yin spirit vein on the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse, so he decided to go looking for it himself.Qing Wan was meek, and obedient too. She immediately closed her eyes and circulated her cultivation base.Whoosh!Her red dress billowed like a fire lighting up the night sky, revealing her slender, pearly white legs. Indistinct wisps of soul power rose up around her.She looked like a peerlessly beautiful immortal ghost, an enchantress from a painting.A mere moment later, Qing Wan\u2019s eyes popped open, and she turned and peered into the distant darkness.\u201cDid you sense something?\u201d asked Su Yi.Qing Wan stuttered, \u201cMystic Master, with my cultivation, I can only vaguely sense that in the distant northwest, the inauspicious yin energy is far more concentrated than it is here. I just don\u2019t know whether or not that\u2019s the place you\u2019re looking for or not.\u201d\u201cThe northwest? That should be where the \u2018peach orchard\u2019 Guo Bing described is.\u201d Su Yi pondered momentarily, then ordered, \u201cLead the way.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Ge Changling Left a Stele, Su Xuanjun Left His NameSu Yi and Qing Wan proceeded northwest under the cover of darkness.Throughout their journey, they heard nothing but the chirping of crickets, the rustling of leaves, and the occasional bestial howl. They didn\u2019t run into any other ghosts.Su Yi naturally understood why.When a tiger went out for a stroll, all other beasts got out of its way.To the various low-class ghosts roaming the mountains, Qing Wan\u2019s aura was like a tiger\u2019s; it was more than enough to send them scampering off in terror.However, it was difficult for a bashful girl like Qing Wan to make such a mental connection.They traveled northwest for an hour.A patch of multi-colored mists rose within the darkness. From a distance, it looked like silk ribbons floating down to the mortal world. The sight was particularly eye-catching at night.The rainbow mists covered a peach orchard that stretched as far as the eye could see.Before they even drew close, Qing Wan stopped in her tracks, then exclaimed, \u201cMystic Master, that powerful yin energy is deep inside the peach orchard, but I can sense another terrifying presence within the woods. It seems like it's specifically designed to counter yin souls like me.\u201dSu Yi stared for a moment. Then, his eyes lit up with a strange light, and he whispered, \u201cHere, yin harbors yang. Yang conceives yin, and yin gives rise to yang. This is actually a natural \u2018Yin-Yang polarity land.\u2019 No wonder the woods give off such a dense Peachblossom Miasma.\u201dThe colorful mists looked bright and beautiful, but they contained one of the most deadly poisons in the world. It was known as Peachblossom Miasma.The miasma would invade the body of any living thing that drew near, melting them into nothing but a pile of pus.Suddenly, Su Yi laughed. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, in addition to the inauspicious yin spirit vein I\u2019ve been searching for, there\u2019s also a Pure Yang Fire Peach Tree with its roots planted directly in the spirit vein!\u201dHe understood.Even if the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse knew the inauspicious yin spirit vein was buried here, there was no way he\u2019d dare approach the peach orchard.The reason was simple: the pure yang aura of the Fire Peaches was a natural counter to wicked creatures like him!\u201cTo produce such dense Peachblossom Miasma, that Fire Peach Tree has to be at least five hundred years old. Both its fruit and its heartwood are tier-four. Within the Great Zhou Dynasty, that\u2019s extremely rare!\u201dWhen he realized this, Su Yi inwardly celebrated that he hadn\u2019t left earlier. Otherwise, he would likely have missed this grand stroke of fortune.\u201cHold this piece of bamboo in your hand.\u201d Su Yi took out two bamboo talismans. He kept one for himself, then passed the other to Qing Wan.The bamboo was inscribed with a basic mark called a \u201cCloth-Cleansing Inscription.\u201d When you held it in your hand, it warded off filth and the taint of wicked creatures. It could protect you from toxins, miasma, and corpse poison. It was one of the treasures Su Yi had prepared specifically for their journey into Mother Ghost Ridge.When Qing Wan held her talisman, her keen senses picked up on threads of clean energy flowing around her, like gentle breezes. It was indescribably comfortable.The two of them immediately proceeded toward the peach grove.Whoosh~!The lustrous, rainbow mists of\u00a0Peachblossom\u00a0Miasma receded like the tides before reaching them, unable to draw any closer. It was an amazing sight.Even Qing Wan couldn\u2019t help but exclaim to herself,\u00a0The Mystic Master\u2019s methods really are indescribably wondrous.The incomparably toxic Peachblossom Miasma cleared a path for them, so their journey was smooth and uninhibited. They walked for a few more miles until suddenly, Su Yi paused.In the distance, he saw a tree that emitted a radiance as bright and red as flame. It lit up the night sky, dazzling to the extreme.The tree wasn\u2019t large; it was only about ten feet tall. Its branches curved like an umbrella of jade-green leaves. Each individual leaf flowed with halos of verdant light.The trunk was about as thick as a human wrist, and the bark looked like a dragon\u2019s scales.That surging, fiery light originated from the tree. Even from a distance, it gave off a burning sensation, much like staring directly into the sun.\u201cYin alone cannot grow, and yang alone cannot create. In this Yin-Yang polarity land, only the inauspicious yin vein could give rise to a Pure Yang Fire Peach Tree of this level\u2026.\u201d Su Yi felt great.It was fair to say that all of his gains from this journey combined paled in comparison to this single peach tree!Especially since there was an inauspicious yin spirit vein beneath it. That was no less valuable than the tree.\u201cMystic Master, that peach tree\u2019s power is too scary. I\u2026 I don\u2019t dare get any closer\u2026.\u201d Qing Wan was still far away from it, but she was trembling, anxiety written all over her pretty little face.Peach wood was a natural counter for ghosts.Each time the common folk welcomed a new year, they\u2019d carve peachwood talismans and place them above their doors to ward off evil, calamity, and ghosts of all kinds.But this Pure Yang Fire Peach Tree was no ordinary peach wood; it was a tier-four spiritual material, brimming with power. How could any ghost endure it?If Qing Wan could cultivate to the \u201cphantasm\u201d level and step into the Origin Dao, she would no longer need to fear such spiritual materials.\u201cYou can just remain here,\u201d said Su Yi, proceeding on his own. He could already tell that this Pure Yang Fire Peach Tree was eight hundred years old, far older than his initial estimate.Furthermore, peaches red as flames dangled beneath the leaves, like radiant miniature suns. They were only dimly discernable beneath the cover of jade-green leaves.But when Su Yi drew near, his pupils suddenly constricted.That was because he saw a stone stele embedded in the dirt beside the Fire Peach Tree.The words\u00a0\u201cThis\u00a0stele was left by Ge\u00a0Changling. No one is to approach. Anyone who does shall be summarily executed!\u201d were written on its surface.The characters were with vigorous strokes and fine details, and they emanated a solemn killing intent.Ge Changling?\u00a0Su Yi furrowed his brow. The name sounded a bit familiar; he dimly recalled hearing it during his first seventeen years in this body. However, he still couldn\u2019t quite recall who that was.But that didn\u2019t stop him from realizing that Ge Changling had long since discovered the Pure Yang Fire Peach Tree, and furthermore, that he saw it as his private property. The sign was a warning for others to stay away.\u201cSpiritual lifeforms like this are born of heaven and nourished\u00a0in earth. Are they yours just because you say they are?\u201d Su Yi sneered and shook his head, disregarding the warning completely.But when he approached, the leaves shook. Fiery light condensed within the branches, outlining a short, stumpy figure.The dwarf looked like a child, but his hair and eyebrows were white with age, and his eyes were bright green.As soon as he appeared, he shouted, \u201cYoung man, didn\u2019t you see the words written on that stone stele? Leave right this instant! Or else, don\u2019t blame this old man for killing you on the spot!\u201dBoth his words and\u00a0expression\u00a0were harsh.But Su Yi merely glanced at him inquisitively. \u201cAnd here I almost took you seriously. It turns out you\u2019re nothing but a teensy little nature spirit!\u201dThe dwarf was stunned, then he roared, \u201cWhat a mouth you\u2019ve got on you! You dare look down on me?\u201dSu Yi suddenly stepped forward, his eyes flashing with terrifyingly cold light. He stared directly at the dwarf and said flatly, \u201cEven someone who\u2019d cultivated into a yao emperor wouldn\u2019t dare be so impudent before me. You\u2019re nothing but a puny little nature spirit. Who the hell do you think you are?\u201dWhen he met Su Yi\u2019s gaze, the dwarf felt his soul palpitate. Indescribable terror coursed through him, as if a divine monarch were bearing down on him. He quivered in fright, then fell from the tree with a thud. He lay there, sprawled in the dirt, unable to get back up.\u201cMystic Master, forgive me! Forgive me!\u201d The dwarf lowered his head and begged for mercy, trembling from head to toe. He looked as if he were about to collapse.A mere thread of the Sword of the Nine Hell\u2019s aura scared him this badly? No wonder that, despite countless years, few figures of note have emerged from the ranks of nature spirits.\u00a0Su Yi inwardly shook his head.He put his hands behind his back, then turned his attention to the Fire Peach Tree. \u201cGet up. So long as you answer a few questions honestly, I\u2019ll forgive your earlier display of poor manners.\u201d\u201cThank you for sparing my life!\u201d The dwarf kowtowed repeatedly. Only then did he dare get back up.Su Yi pointed to the words on the stone stele. \u201cWho is this Ge Changling guy?\u201d\u201cMystic Master, Ge Changling is one of the nine \u2018non-Zhou\u2019 kings, the \u2018Sea-Swallowing King.\u2019 He\u2019s in the An\u0101srava Realm. When he first came here thirty years ago, he was already publicly recognized as one of the dynasty\u2019s ten Xiantian Martial Ancestors,\u201d Said the dwarf respectfully.An\u0101srava was the last of the Four Realms of the Martial Dao. Reaching it meant stepping into the ranks of \u201cxiantian\u201d, or \u201cprecelestial\u201d cultivators. This represented a full-body metamorphosis, akin to rebirth.Thus, such cultivators were known as \u201cXiantian Martial Ancestors.\u201dSetting aside those so-called \u201cEarthly Immortals\u201d, Xiantian Martial Ancestors were the strongest experts the Great Zhou had to offer.As he said this, the dwarf snuck a glance at Su Yi, only to discover that he seemed perfectly calm, as if he didn\u2019t care in the least. Su Yi\u2019s casual composure made the dwarf\u2019s heart shake.This youth made it here easily, and his aura was so terrifying earlier. Now, he doesn\u2019t even seem afraid of a Xiantian Martial Ancestor. Then he\u2026 Just how terrifying of an existence is he?\u201cThis Ge Changling guy didn\u2019t just cut the tree down. Was that because he planned to come back periodically and pluck the Fire Peaches? Does he plan to use them as a medicinal foundation for his attempt to break into the Origin Dao?'' asked Su Yi.The dwarf said hurriedly, \u201cMystic Master, your eyes are bright as torches. The Sea-Swallowing King once said that Fire Peaches were born of heaven and nourished by the earth, and that they were rare treasures. Cutting the tree down would be like desecrating a divine treasure. That\u2019s why he left that\u00a0stone stele to\u00a0warn people from coming too close.\u201dHe paused, then continued, \u201cThe Fire Peach Tree flowers and fruits once every ten years. Each time, it will produce nine Fire Peaches. Judging by the time, the Sea-Swallowing King will visit to pick the fruit within the year.\u201dSu Yi smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that if I pick the peaches, I\u2019ll offend the Sea-Swallowing King? Should I take that as a warning?\u201dThe dwarf was so scared, his lips quivered. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare! Mystic Master, please don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201dSu Yi rubbed his chin, then looked over the fruit. \u201cHow many of the fruits currently on the tree are ripe?\u201d\u201cThree,\u201d said the dwarf honestly. \u201cThe other six still need time to mature. It\u2019ll be at least half a year until they\u2019re ready.\u201dSu Yi furrowed his brow, then sighed. \u201cFine, then. You can just go fetch the three ripe Fire Peaches.\u201dI really came at the wrong time. If the Fire Peaches aren\u2019t ripe, they\u2019re tier-two spiritual medicines at most\u2014not worth much at all.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d The dwarf hesitated, then whispered, \u201cMystic Master, this humble one dares not offend you, but I dare not offend the Sea-Swallowing King either. How\u2026.\u201dSu Yi walked right up to the stone stele and shook his wrist. Mortal Edge emerged from its sheath, and he used the blade like a writing brush. After a few quick swishes and scattered stone fragments, a line of text appeared on the stele:\u201cOn the fourth day of the second month of the Great Zhou\u2019s calendar, Su Yi took three Fire Peaches and left.\u201dThe words were clear and elegant, yet they surged with power.Su Yi then returned his sword to its sheath and looked at the dwarf. \u201cIf Ge Changling shows up, just show him the words on the stele.\u201dThe dwarf sighed in relief, then bowed gratefully. \u201cThank you for your understanding, Mystic Master. This old man will go pick your peaches now.\u201dPoof!He vanished, then reappeared above the tree.Before long, he\u2019d plucked three lustrous Fire Peaches, each glowing with spirituality. They were about the size of a fist, bright red and translucent, with an enticing, fruity aroma. The smell alone soothed the nerves and calmed the heart.Su Yi took out three jade boxes, then placed one peach into each box and sealed them away.Then, he pointed to the ground beneath the tree. \u201cI\u2019m here for the inauspicious yin spirit vein too. I\u2019ll\u00a0have to trouble\u00a0you to remove it for me.\u201dIt was just one sentence, but the dwarf felt as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning. He wanted to cry, but he had no tears.This was no \u201cmystic master.\u201d This was obviously a demon king hellbent on ransacking the place!Jaspaaar's ThoughtsTLDR I\u2019m going with the pinyin \u201cyao\u201d over the common translation \u201cdemon.\u201dIt seems the most common translation for \u5996, \u201cyao\u201d is \u201cdemon\u201d, and a part of me is like \u201cwell, if \u2018demon\u2019 is good enough for -insert translator I admire-, it\u2019s good enough for me\u201d.But another part of me is like \u201cyeah, but come on. A tree or stone or cat that obtains sentience is not the least bit \u2018demonic\u2019 and if readers of Japanese content can handle the word \u2018youkai\u2019, readers of Chinese content can handle \u2018yao/yaoguai.\u2019\u201dAlso, \u201cDemon\u201d has specific connotations I\u2019d just as soon avoid, especially since there may or may not be actual demons (\u9b54)\u00a0in this novel. Are there? We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. ;)I think \u201cspirit\u201d is closer in feel to the Chinese word \u201cyao\u201d, but I use spirit in eight million other unrelated terms already. I think I\u2019m going to do is use \u201cyao\u201d as an overarching term for this whole broad category of creatures, and \u201cspirit\u201d for individual varieties, ie \u201cfox spirits.\u201d Like, \"I saw a yao, I think it was a fox spirit.\"Is that confusing? I hope not, but if you think so, feel free to tell me in the comments. I\u2019m reasonably well-versed in these novels and their tropes by now, but I\u2019m not as well-versed in their translation conventions since I generally read these things raw. I\u2019m happy to just make decisions on my own, but I\u2019m open to reader feedback and constructive criticism, too.\u00a0If you object, don't be shy!BTW, the word I\u2019m translating as \u201cnature spirit\u201d is \u7cbe\u602a, which is a bit more specific, and doesn\u2019t contain the character \u201cyao.\u201d Su Yi\u2019s remark about yao emperors implies that \u201cnature spirits\u201d are either a subset of yao, or that they have the potential to become yao through cultivation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Enlightening Tao Qingshan, the Secrets of the Soul JadeThe dwarf took a deep breath, rallied his courage, and said, \u201cMystic Master, as I\u2019m sure you know, if you take the inauspicious yin spirit vein, the Fire\u00a0Peach Tree\u00a0can\u2019t survive on its own\u2026.\u201dSu Yi cut him off. \u201cI just want a segment of it. I won\u2019t damage the tree.\u201dWhen he saw that Su Yi wouldn\u2019t tolerate any disobedience, the dwarf no longer dared hesitate. He transformed into a streak of spiritual light and burrowed into the ground.Shortly after, he re-emerged, carrying a foot-long piece of black chalcedony.The chalcedony emanated a bone-chilling cold; the dwarf\u2019s eyebrows, hair, and whiskers were all coated in a layer of white frost, and he shivered to stay warm.\u201cMystic Master, the inauspicious yin vein segment is within this piece of chalcedony.\u201d The dwarf proffered it with both hands. He smiled, but it was so rigid that it was uglier than if he\u2019d burst into tears.He didn\u2019t dare try any funny business with regard to the spirit vein; if Su Yi saw through him, it could lead to disaster.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Su Yi accepted the foot of chalcedony, looked it over, and nodded in satisfaction.This was a spirit vein! Yes, it was only a foot long, but no number of spirit stones could compare to it!When he reached the peak of the Qi Accumulation Realm, using this treasure to cultivate would achieve unbelievable effects!Of course, this inauspicious yin vein was best suited for a yin soul like Qing Wan. When she needed it, Su Yi wouldn\u2019t mind sharing it with her.He took out another jade box, then placed the spirit vein segment inside. He watched as the dwarf winced; he obviously couldn\u2019t bear to part with it.Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but find it funny. \u201cRelax. I wouldn\u2019t sink so low as to take advantage of a little nature spirit like you.\u201dHe then took his bamboo staff and began writing in the dirt.\u00a0Before long, a cultivation incantation appeared in the soil.\u201cYou\u2019re a nature spirit born of heaven and nourished of earth. Realizing your dao will be exceptionally difficult. This \u2018Spirit-Nourishing Incantation\u2019 can help you metamorphosize and transform from a\u00a0nature\u00a0spirit into a \u2018yao cultivator.\u2019 Its value far exceeds a few Fire Peaches and a segment of spirit vein. You\u2019d best treasure it.\u201dWith that, Su Yi smiled and turned to leave.Nature spirits were all classified as \u201cyao.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter whether they were plants, birds, or terrestrial beasts. Any of them that achieved sentience became nature spirits. They were also sometimes called \u201cyaoguai\u201d, or \u201cgoblins.\u201dBut becoming a real yao cultivator wasn\u2019t easy.Especially for those with distinct bloodlines or unique talents. Stepping into the ranks of yao cultivators required first overcoming unimaginable hardships.The dwarf was a nature spirit born of the Fire Peach Tree. Although he could appear in human form, he was far from undergoing a true metamorphosis or obtaining a true human body. He naturally didn\u2019t count as a real yao cultivator.When Su Yi and Qing Wan disappeared from the peach grove, the dwarf finally relaxed, as if a massive weight had been lifted from his shoulders. His heart shook with lingering terror.Then he turned his attention towards the ground. The lines of elegant, unrestrained handwriting gradually drew him in.A long time passed before he finally regained his senses. His features flooded with shock, delight, excitement, and bewilderment.\u201cWith this incantation alone, I\u2019ll be able to cast off the shackles of my true body and undergo metamorphosis!\u201dThe dwarf exclaimed in excitement, jumping for joy, beside himself with delight.It wasn\u2019t at all strange that he\u2019d lose control like this. The Spirit-Nourishing Incantation Su Yi had given him was an incantation from the treasured classic of the yao way, \u201cFostering the Dao.\u201d It described the profundities of metamorphosis, and it was one of the most top-class cultivation methods out there.Although the dwarf didn\u2019t know its origins, there was no way he\u2019d miss how shockingly profound it was!He suddenly knelt in the direction Su Yi had left in and kowtowed, his expression pious as he vowed, \u201cMystic Master, I, Tao Qingshan, will never forget your grace!\u201d\u2026..Outside the peach grove.Qing Wan carefully trailed after Su Yi. She dared not get too close, but she also dared not stray too far away. She was meek as could be.Su Yi took out a dozen or so pill bottles and passed them to her. \u201cQing Wan, you should hold onto these.\u201dHe\u2019d obtained all of these pills from the\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse. They were perfectly suited for a yin soul\u2019s cultivation.\u201cAh?\u201d Qing Wan didn\u2019t quite know what to do. She said uncomfortably, \u201cMystic Master, I achieved no merit, so I deserve no reward. I\u2014.\u201dShe was just considering how best to refuse when Su Yi irritably cut her off. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of stupid pills. Why be so polite? Just take them!\u201dQing Wan quivered in terror, then hurriedly accepted them, looking ashamed of herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you angry. I\u2026 I won\u2019t dare do it again\u2026.\u201dWhen Su Yi saw how nervous she was, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh.He didn\u2019t know why, but when he saw how pitiful, timid, and reserved she was, he couldn\u2019t resist the urge to chastise her.\u00a0He was perhaps\u2026 annoyed that she didn\u2019t fight back?\u201cMystic Master, are you still mad at me?\u201d Qing Wan asked tentatively.She tilted her head and looked over, her beautiful but slightly chubby face fraught with worry.From Su Yi\u2019s perspective, she looked downright silly.He couldn\u2019t help but stretch out his hand and pinch her cheek. \u201cSilly girl. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll cause me endless worry going forward.\u201dDespite his words, he found himself smiling.When she felt her cheeks pinched, Qing Wan jumped in fright.\u00a0But when she saw Su Yi smile, she couldn\u2019t help but smile too. Soon, her pretty face lit up.Her eyebrows curved, and she looked as pretty as a painting.The two of them, one man, one ghost, walked through the empty wilderness under the cover of night, but they didn\u2019t feel the least bit lonesome.Fifteen minutes later, Su Yi\u2019s ears twitched. He heard the faint rustling of distant footsteps in the underbrush. Although it was faint, it couldn\u2019t escape his keen hearing.He stopped, then said casually, \u201cBe careful. If the situation looks bad, hide in the Soul-Nourishing Gourd.\u201dQing Wan was startled, but she hurriedly nodded.Before long, a group emerged from the darkness.There were seven men in total, all of them clad in black and carrying weapons. They\u00a0emanated\u00a0a cold, sinister air and a slightly baleful aura.Their leader, a middle-aged man with twin sabers and a hideous scar across his forehead, exclaimed when he saw them. \u201cQing Wan!\u201dHe recognized the floating young woman in the red dress at a glance.\u201cDidn\u2019t that traitor Wu Ruoqiu take her with him? Why would she appear here now?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that scumbag has come back?\u201dThe others were in uproar too. All of them were stunned.Shortly after, all of them fixed their gazes on Su Yi. They immediately realized that he wasn\u2019t Wu Ruoqiu, but rather, an unfamiliar youth.\u201cWhat\u2019s your connection to Wu Ruoqiu? Why do you have Qing Wan with you?\u201d The leader said icily, his gaze somewhat guarded.It was the middle of the night, and these mountains were haunted and far from civilization. Why was this youth here now, and why did he have Qing Wan with him?Something fishy was going on here.\u201cAh, so Wu Ruoqiu betrayed the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate? No wonder no one\u2019s come looking for trouble despite how long he\u2019s been dead,\u201d Su Yi pondered out loud. After seeing through their identities, he pointed to Qing Wan. \u201cI can see that you recognize her. Might you tell me her origins?\u201dThe scar-faced man and his followers frowned. They\u2019d just realized two things:First, Wu Ruoqiu was already dead, and it was highly likely that this delicately handsome youth was the one who\u2019d killed him. Second, the youth didn\u2019t know Qing Wan\u2019s origins!\u201cWant to know? We can tell you, but give us your Soul-Nurturing Gourd first,\u201d said their scarred leader coldly. \u201cThat thief, Wu Ruoqiu, stole it. It should never have belonged to an outsider like you in the first place!\u201dThe others clenched their weapons, ready to strike at any moment.Su Yi merely tossed the gourd over. \u201cTell me.\u201dThe scarred man caught the gourd. He was briefly stunned, as if he dared not believe it had been so easy.\u00a0The others were stunned too.But when they next looked at Su Yi, they were no\u00a0longer as on\u00a0guard, and their eyes glinted with newfound viciousness.One of them growled a warning, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Qian, time is short. I\u2019m afraid that stubborn bunch might catch up to us at any moment now\u2026..\u201dThe leader\u2019s eyes flashed with cold light. \u201cHow about this? If you want to know Qing Wan\u2019s origins, come with us. We\u2019ll take you somewhere, and once we arrive, we\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know.\u201dSu Yi rubbed his nose and sighed. \u201cQing Wan, do they think I\u2019m a pushover?\u201dBefore Qing Wan could respond, the scarred middle-aged man snorted coldly, \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t behave yourself. All of you, attack! Kill him!\u201dThe others smiled hideously and charged. They raised their sabers, spears, and axes, cutting through the tranquility of the night.But then, a clear sword hum rang out, followed by several flashes of cold light.Then there was a clang as the cold light disappeared into its sheath.Meanwhile, the group charging at Su Yi froze momentarily, then toppled to the ground like falling logs.Every last one of them had a new, bright red gash on their throats. Blood poured from the wounds, drenching the ground below.Even in death, their faces still wore those same hideous grins.Victory and defeat, life and death, all decided in the blink of an eye!Su Yi stood in place, holding his bamboo staff, as if he\u2019d never moved at all.Only the scarred middle-aged man remained, but he was already scared out of his wits. His thighs quivered, and he was drenched in cold sweats. He\u2019d practically lost his soul.The sword struck like lightning, then was back in its sheath just as quickly, ending all six of his companions\u2019 lives in an instant.Overwhelmingly terrifying!\u201cNow\u00a0do you have anything you want to say to me?\u201d asked Su Yi casually, his hands behind his back.The scarred middle-aged man thudded to his knees, lowered his head, and begged, \u201cSenior, please show mercy! I was blind and foolish to have offended you. I humbly beseech you to spare my pitiful little life!\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I wanted to hear.\u201d Su Yi\u2019s brow furrowed slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one last chance. If you answer badly, you can\u00a0just go rejoin\u00a0your companions.\u201dThe scarred middle-aged man said in terror, \u201cSenior, please calm your fury! I\u2019ll talk, I\u2019ll talk!\u201dHe then proceeded to spill the beans in full detail, telling Su Yi everything he knew about Qing Wan. He seemed terrified that if he held back, he too would fall beneath Su Yi\u2019s sword.According to his tale, Wu Ruoqiu and his master, Weng Yunqi, had betrayed the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate ten years prior.As he betrayed and fled the sect, Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s master, Weng Yunqi, stole three of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate\u2019s treasures.They were the Soul-Nurturing Gourd, which housed a ghost infant at the time, a secret scroll detailing how to raise Ghoul Worms, and most mysterious of all, a soul jade of unknown origins.Qing Wan was the yin soul they\u2019d found within the soul jade.Not even the heretical cultivators of the older generation knew her origins, but they were certain it wasn\u2019t simple.They'd discerned this from the soul jade they first discovered her in.Seth's Thoughts\u2026.Am I the only one who had never heard the name\u00a0chalcedony\u00a0before? I really wanted totranslate the Chinese characters literally, \u201cjade marrow\u201d or \u201cjade essence\u201d, but it looks like it actually refers to real stone that actually exists\u2026.Sigh.Anyway, the part I translated as \u201c(Su Yi was) annoyed that she didn\u2019t fight back\u201d is half of a\u00a0Lu Xun\u00a0quote. The full quote, \u54c0\u5176\u4e0d\u5e78,\u6012\u5176\u4e0d\u4e89, means something like \u201cpity his misfortunate, but be angry that he didn\u2019t struggle\u201d or \u201cpity his misfortune, but condemn his passivity.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - A Familiar Face Outside the City GatesHow unusual was that soul jade?The scarred middle-aged man didn\u2019t know.\u00a0All he knew was that the elders of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate viewed Qing Wan as a treasure on account of that soul jade.Otherwise, given those heretical cultivators\u2019 tendencies, discovering such a pure yin soul would have been an irresistible temptation. They likely would have already used her as a \u2018living\u2019 sacrifice.When he heard this, Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but glance at Qing Wan. \u201cDo you remember that piece of soul jade?\u201dQing Wan shook her head and whispered, \u201cWhen I woke up, I was already with that Wu Ruoqiu. Everything before that is a complete blank.\u201dThis was her first time hearing that she\u2019d once occupied a piece of mysterious soul jade.So, they found me in a piece of soul jade. I didn\u2019t simply become a yin soul upon my death.\u00a0This revelation left her daze.\u00a0Who\u2026 Who exactly was I before?\u201cHow did the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate obtain that soul jade?\u201d Su Yi glanced at the scarred middle-aged man once more, but the man merely shook his head.\u00a0His position in the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate wasn\u2019t high at all; he had no access to classified information of this level.Su Yi mulled it over, then asked a few other questions about the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate.It turned out that ever since facing annihilation a hundred years ago, the lucky survivors went dormant for a hundred years. They\u2019d already secretly recovered a certain degree of power.Today, the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate headquarters had a sect leader, two vice sect leaders, and nine elders.Them aside, the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate had six branches dispersed throughout the Great Zhou.Each branch had a branch leader and four dharma protectors, and they reigned over all the sect disciples and underlings in the area.The scarred middle-aged man and his late companions, as well as Wu Ruoqiu and Weng Yunqi, were all members of the sect\u2019s Imperatorial Province Branch.When he heard this, Su Yi instantly understood.The Great Zhou was divided into six provinces and thirty-six prefectures, while the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate had six branches. They\u2019d undoubtedly built one branch per province.For instance, the Imperatorial Province that Cloudriver Prefecture was a part of had just one such base.In other words, it was highly likely that the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate had already spread their forces throughout the Great Zhou\u2019s territory!Of course, the way Su Yi saw it, if the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate was relying on inept small fries like the ones he\u2019d just fought, they wouldn\u2019t be able to stir up any waves worth mentioning.The scarred middle-aged man might be a disciple of the Imperatorial Province Branch, but he didn\u2019t even know who their branch leader was\u2026.It was utterly ludicrous.All the man knew was that Wu Ruoqiu\u2019s master, Weng Yunqi, was once one of the Imperatorial Province Branch\u2019s four dharma protectors, and that his whereabouts had been unknown ever since he betrayed the sect.After learning all this, Su Yi sank into thought.Ten years ago, Weng Yunqi and Wu Ruoqiu fled the sect, taking the mysterious soul jade, Soul-Nurturing Gourd, and the secret method for raising Ghoul Worms with them.Yet when Su Yi killed Wu Ruoqiu not long ago, all of these treasures fell into Su Yi\u2019s hands save for the soul jade.Of course, that included Qing Wan.But this revelation only led to more questions.\u00a0If Wu Ruoqiu was only Weng Yunqi\u2019s disciple, why did he have his master\u2019s stolen treasures?Where has Weng Yunqi gone? Is he alive or dead?If I\u2019d known Qing Wan\u2019s origins were so unusual, I wouldn\u2019t have killed Wu Ruoqiu so soon\u2026.\u00a0Su Yi sighed to himself.I would never have guessed that Qing Wan\u2019s origins touched on so many secrets.\u00a0If I want to learn Qing Wan\u2019s origins, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to start with investigating the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate\u2026..Su Yi then set those thoughts aside.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t all that concerned about who Qing Wan had been in life, but if she wanted to uncover the truth, he didn\u2019t mind lending her a hand.\u201cSenior, I\u2019ve told you everything I know, so please show mercy and spare my humble little life!\u201d When he saw Su Yi sink into a long silence, the scarred man hurriedly kowtowed. He was scared out of his wits.But it was then that the sound of distant, hurried footsteps cut through the darkness. Shortly after, Cheng Wuyong, Yuan Luoxi, and their companions appeared.\u00a0When they saw Su Yi, as well as the corpses sprawled out nearby, Cheng Wuyong and the guards couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.\u201cWere you chasing them?\u201d asked Su Yi.Cheng Wuyong nodded. \u201cMystic Master, just now, this bunch took advantage of the cover of darkness to approach the run-down temple in secret. They snuck about like ghosts; it was obvious at a glance that they were up to no good. When I discovered them, they scampered off in a panic. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed they\u2019d run into you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m finished\u2026.\u201d The scar-faced man sank into despair, looking as dejected as if he were attending his parents\u2019 funerals.\u201cThey\u2019re from the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate, but there\u2019s only one survivor left to interrogate. I\u2019ll leave him to you.\u201d After giving these orders, Su Yi picked up the Soul-Nurturing Gourd and led Qing Wan away.Cheng Wuyong naturally didn\u2019t stand on ceremony. He immediately ordered the other guards to tie the scarred middle-aged man up and bring him back to Guangling City for a thorough interrogation.\u201cMiss, what are you looking at?\u201d Cheng Wuyong suddenly noticed that something was strange about Yuan Luoxi\u2019s expression.Yuan Luoxi whispered, \u201cUncle Yong, did you notice? Just now, there was a girl in a red dress floating beside the Mystic Master. She was really pretty\u2026 Her eyes were so big, and her skin was white as snow. She was almost a bit\u00a0too\u00a0pretty\u2026.\u201dCheng Wuyong\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMiss, if my deductions are correct, that\u2019s most likely a yin soul the Mystic Master has subdued.\u201d\u201cA ghost?\u201d Yuan Luoxi gasped.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut a ghost like that isn\u2019t scary at all! This is my first time hearing that there are such peerlessly beautiful specters out there!\u201dShe suddenly seemed envious. \u201cIf I had a ghost like that as my subordinate, I\u2019d definitely brush her hair every day and make her try on different clothes. Oh, and I\u2019d have her wear all sorts of beautiful jewelry. It would definitely be a blast!\u201d\u201c....\u201d Cheng Wuyong didn\u2019t even know what to say.\u00a0What\u2026 What kind of hobby is that?\u2026\u2026The run-down temple.When they returned, Su Yi immediately sat down and crossed his legs.During this trip to Mother Ghost Ridge, he\u2019d had quite the harvest. He\u2019d killed the Six-Severings Yin Corpse, obtaining a ink jade pendant storage treasure, nine stalks of spiritual medicine, fifty-plus spirit stones, and around a dozen bottles of pills suitable for Qing Wan\u2019s cultivation\u2026.Then, he\u2019d traded the Six Yin Grass with Yuan Luoxi in exchange for seventeen stalks of spiritual medicine, five of which were tier two.On top of all that, in the peach orchard, he\u2019d obtained three tier-four Fire Peaches and a foot-long segment of yin spirit vein.Adding all these treasures together, Su Yi wouldn\u2019t have to worry about cultivation resources any time soon.There was still more to see in Mother Ghost Ridge, but Su Yi had no plans to investigate any further.He could vaguely deduce that between the Six-Severings Yin Corpse and the heretical cultivators of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate, others had long since swept the mountain of all its treasures.\u201cI just don\u2019t know when Lingxue is getting back\u2026.\u201d Su Yi muttered to himself.He planned to leave Guangling City in the near future, and he had no lingering attachments to the place.The only thing he couldn\u2019t just let go of was Wen Lingxue.When dawn broke over the horizon,\u00a0Su Yi, Yuan Luoxi, and company set off and left Mother Ghost Ridge.....Outside the mountains, near the unmarked mass graves.The group had left two retainers by the foot of the mountains to look after the horses. When the two of them saw Yuan Luoxi and their companions return safely, they finally sighed in relief.Once everyone reconvened, they set off for Guangling City.Except that this time, Yuan Luoxi and her companions led their horses on foot, walking so as to accompany Su Yi and Guo Bing. None of them showed any signs of impatience, either.Su Yi noticed all of these changes, but he declined to comment.As they neared Guangling City\u2019s main gate, he suddenly recalled something, and he warned them, \u201cEveryone, it would be best if you didn\u2019t speak of what happened in Mother Ghost Ridge. If you do, well, I\u2019m not worried about myself, but I\u2019m afraid you might get mixed up in something dangerous.\u201dMixed up in something dangerous?\u00a0Yuan Luoxi was stunned for a moment. Then she said hurriedly, \u201cMystic Master, thank you for your warning, but we\u2019re not at all afraid of the Deathbringer\u2019s Gate knocking on our door.\u201dShe sounded completely confident.But she\u2019d obviously misunderstood.\u00a0Cheng Wuyong and the others seemed confused too.Su Yi thought about it, then explained in more detail. \u201cIf Ge Changling finds out you were with me, it\u2019s hard to say whether it\u2019ll end well for you or not.\u201dGe Changling!Cheng Wuyong\u2019s expression changed dramatically. This was one of the Great Zhou\u2019s nine non-Zhou kings, the Sea-Swallowing King. Furthermore, of the nine of them, he was solidly in the top three!He\u2019d leaped into the ranks of Xiantian Martial Ancestors a full thirty years ago!The other guards went rigid, their eyes blank.How on earth could our expedition into Mother Ghost Ridge land us in hot water with the Sea-Swallowing King?He\u2019s like a god of war amongst men! A legend every martial artist in the Great Zhou can only look up to!Yuan Luoxi\u2019s confident smile faltered. Her eyes widened, and her pretty face looked lost.Ge Changling?Father says he\u2019s an expert so lofty, even our Yuan Family can only gaze upon him from afar\u2026.A while later, Cheng Wuyong finally regained his composure. \u201cMystic Master, are you saying that some of what occurred in Mother Ghost Ridge had a connection to the Sea-Swallowing King?\u201dSu Yi dared call the Sea-Swallowing King directly by name, but Cheng Wuyong certainly didn\u2019t.\u201cGiven his status, he\u2019s unlikely to make this hard on you,\u201d said Su Yi offhandedly. \u201cIn the unlikely event he does, have him come find me instead.\u201dThese words only made it harder for Cheng Wuyong to remain calm.\u00a0Is Mystic Master Su implying that it\u2019s highly likely the Sea-Swallowing King will come looking for him?But the most unbelievable part is that he doesn\u2019t seem at all concerned about the threat the Sea-Swallowing King represents!This small interlude only silently increased the awe Yuan Luoxi and company already felt for Su Yi.This time, Guo Bing was actually the most relaxed member of the group.\u00a0Although he was confused too, he had no idea just how terrifying the Sea-Swallowing King, Ge Changling, really was.\u00a0The ignorant were without fear.\u201cMiss Luoxi, you\u2019re finally back!\u201d Suddenly, they heard a burst of hearty laughter from the city gates. A handsome young man in jade robes and a thick cloth belt strode toward them.The black-hatted elder followed immediately after.They were none other than Zhang Yuanxing and Elder Xiong.When he saw them, Su Yi\u2019s expression went a little strange.Two days prior, on Spiritbamboo Island, this young dandy of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2019s Zhang Family had said that working with him would be like flying with the support of powerful winds, and that he\u2019d send Su Yi soaring into the clouds\u2026.Even Fu Shan had found it amusing.As for Su Yi, he naturally saw the entire incident as a mere joke. He laughed, but didn\u2019t take it the least bit seriously.\u00a0He wouldn\u2019t have guessed that he\u2019d run into Zhang Yuanxing again now.\u201cEh? Young Lord Su? Why are you with Miss Luoxi?\u201dAt practically the same time, Zhang Yuanxing saw Su Yi. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you plan to seek refuge with the Yuan Family and serve Miss Luoxi?\u201dHis smile faded, and his brow furrowed in displeasure.After witnessing Su Yi\u2019s performance at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, Zhang Yuanxing appreciated his abilities and took the initiative to extend an invitation. If Su Yi agreed to work under him, he wouldn\u2019t mistreat him.Who would have thought that just two days later, Su Yi would reappear by Yuan Luoxi\u2019s side?This was a blatant slap in the face!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Storekeeper Yue, a Life Lived in VainYuan Luoxi and company all picked up on the displeasure in Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s tone. It caught them all off guard.\u00a0This guy sure has gall. How can he talk to Mystic Master Su like that?Then, they seemed to realize something.\u00a0Zhang Yuanxing most likely doesn\u2019t understand Mystic Master Su\u2019s capabilities, just like us when we first met him\u2026A strange light shone in Yuan Luoxi\u2019s eyes. Indescribable shame and discomfort coursed through her.\u00a0When she first met Su Yi, she was far more brazen than Zhang Yuanxing was now.\u00a0Looking back, I was really stupid\u2026Cheng Wuyong coughed dryly and explained, \u201cYoung Master Zhang, you\u2019ve misunderstood. We and Mys\u2014... Young Lord Su were just traveling together.\u201dAs he spoke, he suddenly recalled Su Yi\u2019s warning against revealing what had happened in Mother Ghost Ridge. That was why he changed Su Yi\u2019s title from \u201cMystic Master\u201d to \u201cYoung Lord.\u201d\u201cIs that really the case?\u201d Zhang Yuanxing was stunned, and he didn\u2019t seem fully convinced.\u201cZhang Yuanxing, is my business with Young Lord Su any of your concern? Actually, I\u2019m the one who ought to be asking questions. Why are you here?\u201d Yuan Luoxi furrowed her brow and interrogated him coldly.Zhang Yuanxing hurriedly laughed, \u201cMiss Luoxi, I heard you were in Guangling City too, so I asked around and learned that you\u2019d led a group to Mother Ghost Ridge. I decided to wait here for you.\u201dYuan Luoxi gazed coldly at him. \u201cAnd why has the glorious young master of the Zhang Family taken it upon himself to wait for me? If you have no other business with me, get out of my way!\u201dIn the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, both the Yuan and Zhang families were among the four peak-level factions.In terms of both status and cultivation, Yuan Luoxi wasn\u2019t the least bit inferior to Zhang Yuanxing. In some ways, she even surpassed him.\u00a0There was naturally no need to be polite to him.Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s smile went a little rigid, and he inwardly felt stifled.\u00a0In the past, Yuan Luoxi wasn\u2019t so impatient with me!\u00a0What\u2019s going on?Just as he was about to say something, he saw Yuan Luoxi turn to look at Su Yi, her oval face carrying a hint of nervous anticipation. \u201cYoung\u2026 Young Lord Su, how about we get something to eat in the city?Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s pupils constricted, and doubt rose within his heart.\u00a0What\u2019s going on here?Cheng Wuyong smiled too. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Without you and Elder Guo, we never would have found the spiritual medicine we were looking for in Mother Ghost Ridge. Now that we\u2019ve returned to the city, it\u2019s only right that we arrange a banquet to express our regard.\u201dWhen he saw this, Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s jaw practically dropped.He knew full well that Cheng Wuyong was an elder of the Yuan Family, as well as a peak Qi Accumulation Realm expert. In terms of status, he wasn't inferior to Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s Uncle Xiong.Seeing Cheng Wuyong treat Su Yi with such respect, it was inevitable that Zhang Yuanxing would be stunned!\u201cSure.\u201d Su Yi nodded.Dawn had passed, and morning had come. Hunger was already gnawing at his stomach.Yuan Luoxi instantly broke into a radiant, moving smile. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! Let\u2019s go right away. I heard that the Immortal Gathering House is the best restaurant in the city, so let\u2019s go there!\u201d\u201cElder Guo, you should come too.\u201d Cheng Wuyong smiled at Guo Bing.Guo Bing hurriedly clasped his fist. \u201cIt would be my honor!\u201dThen, without any further ado, the whole group set off.From beginning to end, none of them paid Zhang Yuanxing any further heed.\u201cUncle Xiong, can you tell what\u2019s happening here?\u201d Zhang Yuanxing furrowed his brow. He felt thoroughly unpleasant. He was the young master of the Zhang Family, yet they\u2019d completely ignored him!\u201cWhen Yuan Luoxi went looking for the medicine picker, Guo Bing, Su Yi was there too. The information you obtained yesterday said as much. It also said that all of them went to Mother Ghost Ridge together.\u201d Uncle Xiong murmured, \u201cFrom the look of things, Su Yi and Guo Bing helped Yuan Luoxi find the medicine they came here in search of. That\u2019s presumably why they\u2019re so grateful?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It seems I\u2019m overthinking this!\u201d Zhang Yuanxing clapped his hands, and the scowl disappeared from his brow. \u201cUncle Xiong, let\u2019s go! We\u2019re going to the Immortal Gathering House too!\u201dWhen he saw Zhang Yuanxing regain his usual high spirits, Uncle Xiong couldn\u2019t help but warn him, \u201cYoung Master, Yuan Luoxi is the Yuan Family Head\u2019s youngest and most spoiled daughter, and her maternal grandfather is the famous \u2018Jingyuan Marquis\u2019, Gu Chenfeng. He\u2019s famous for his temper, and he once said that if anyone sets his sights on Yuan Luoxi before she turns eighteen, he\u2019ll sever all three of the offender\u2019s legs!\u201dZhang Yuanxing\u2019s smile froze, and he unwittingly clenched his legs. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? I\u2019m just trying to make friends for now. Even if there\u2019s a chance of making this a proper marriage, I can just wait until she turns eighteen.\u201dUncle Xiong said, \u201cBut Young Master, you ought to know that Yuan Luoxi has been thoroughly spoiled from a young age, and she\u2019s proud and unreasonable. If you want to pursue her\u2026. You\u2019ll have to mentally prepare yourself first.\u201dZhang Yuanxing nodded animatedly. \u201cHer wildness is the thing I like best about her. She\u2019s like a wild horse; you can\u2019t help but want to tame her\u2026.\u201dUncle Xiong made no further attempts to persuade him.\u00a0He\u2019d been around the block before, and he knew that when it came to pursuing women, young men wouldn\u2019t give up or lower their heads without first falling flat on their face a few times.Meanwhile, in the Immortal Gathering House.It was still early in the morning, so the building was mostly empty, with few guests.But when he learned that the daughter of the prefectural capital\u2019s Yuan Family had come to dine, the owner, Yue Tianhe, struggled free from his concubine\u2019s tender embrace and rushed over to the restaurant at top speeds.He had a servant fetch an aged wine he\u2019d been saving for years. Then, he followed the serving girl delivering their food into the private room on the second floor of the Immortal Gathering House.His face was nothing but warm, welcoming smiles. He was just about to bow and introduce himself when he froze and gasped, \u201cSu\u2026. Su Yi?\u201dThe sizable private dining room currently sat just four people: Su Yi, Guo Bing, Yuan Luoxi, and Cheng Wuyong.And Su Yi sat calmly in the seat of honor!Yue Tianhe was so shocked, his jaw practically fell off.He naturally knew Su Yi, and he knew better than most that this young man wasn\u2019t just some ordinary live-in son-in-law. Even City Lord Fu Shan and Commander Nie Beihu treated him with the utmost respect.News of Su Yi taking first place at the recent Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet had already spread throughout Guangling City. How could someone like\u00a0Yue\u00a0Tianhe remain in the dark?But he still never would have guessed that this early in the morning, the daughter of the prefectural capital\u2019s Yuan Family would host Su Yi at his restaurant, and furthermore, that he\u2019d be the guest of honor!For a moment, Yue Tianhe forgot the greetings and self-introductions he\u2019d prepared.\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Yuan Luoxi. She certainly didn\u2019t recognize Yue Tianhe.Yue Tianhe jumped, then hurriedly bowed, his face nothing but smiles. \u201cYoung Miss Yuan, I\u2019m the owner of the Immortal Gathering House. When I heard that you\u2019d graced us with your presence, I came to offer you a pot of quality wine as a humble token of my respect.\u201dAs he spoke, he proffered it to her.\u201cOh,\u201d said Yuan Luoxi. \u201cDo you recognize Myst\u2014\u2026 Young Lord Su too?\u201dYue Tianhe hurriedly said, \u201cHow could I not know an illustrious youth like Young Lord Su? He\u2019s a first-class celebrity within Guangling City, and I admire him from the bottom of my heart\u2026.\u201dThe words came out in an unceasing torrent. He praised Su Yi with the utmost enthusiasm, clearly trying to indicate that he and Su Yi were on good terms.But when he saw Su Yi\u2019s aloof expression, Cheng Wuyong picked up the hint. He coughed drily and interrupted Yue Tianhe\u2019s endless stream of compliments. \u201cThank you. You can go back for now.\u201dYue Tianhe knew better than to push. He nodded repeatedly, but before he left, he didn\u2019t forget to bid Su Yi farewell. \u201cYoung Lord Su, if you need anything, anything at all, just say the word. I\u2019ll be waiting downstairs, ready to assist at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d\u201cYou really can\u2019t get rid of this guy.\u201d Su Yi laughed after Yue Tianhe finally left, and the others laughed along.In short, the atmosphere was pretty good.But even after returning to the front desk, Yue Tianhe felt dazed. His thoughts kept returning to the same question\u2014When exactly did Su Yi finagle his way into the Yuan Family\u2019s good graces?Suddenly, a crisp, hearty voice rang out. \u201cOwner, which private room is the Yuan Family\u2019s Yuan Luoxi dining in?\u201dYue Tianhe looked up, and when he saw who this new arrival was, he couldn\u2019t help but gasp. He shot forward with a toadyish smile. \u201cAh, so it\u2019s Young Master Zhang!\u201dThis new arrival was none other than Zhang Yuanxing, who exclaimed, \u201cYou recognize me?\u201dYue Tianhe smiled welcomingly and said, \u201cYesterday, I visited the city lord\u2019s manor to deliver wine, and I had the good fortune of seeing you from afar. It was but a single glance, but your peerless grace and lofty bearing left an unforgettable impression on me. That\u2019s why I recognized you as soon as you arrived.\u201dHearing all this flattery made Zhang Yuanxing feel great, but outwardly, he said, \u201cEnough of that. Hurry and lead me to see Miss Luoxi.\u201dYue Tianhe hurriedly did what he was told, practically groveling.Zhang Yuanxing and Uncle Xiong followed him. When they arrived at the door to their private room, Zhang Yuanxing adjusted his clothes and mentally reviewed the excuse he\u2019d prepared.Then, he opened the door, and in the face of Yuan Luoxi\u2019s baffled gaze, he apologetically cupped his fist.\u201cLuoxi, I misunderstood Young Lord Su earlier, so I came here to apologize. Please don\u2019t kick me out.\u201d This was the excuse he\u2019d prepared. He was using Su Yi as an entry point, cleverly preventing anything Yuan Luoxi might say to refuse him a seat at the table.As expected, Yuan Luoxi\u2019s expression softened.\u00a0This left Zhang Yuanxing pleased with his own skill, but he also felt a hint of wordless irritation.Why is bringing up Su Yi so effective with her?\u201cYou said you\u2019re here to apologize to me?\u201d said Su Yi, a strange look on his face.Zhang Yuanxing walked right up to him and helped himself to a seat, a broad smile on his face. \u201cI misunderstood you earlier. Here I thought you\u2019d joined the Yuan Family, but it turns out that you did Luoxi a huge favor\u2026.\u201dAfter explaining himself, he raised his wineglass and said, \u201cI\u2019ll start by taking three penalty drinks!\u201dAfter draining his glass repeatedly, he glanced at the door to the private room. Yue Tianhe was still standing there, just outside the room.Zhang Yuanxing couldn\u2019t help but frown. \u201cCan\u2019t you take a hint? Hurry up and close the door!\u201dYue Tianhe quivered, smiled hurriedly, and left, shutting the door behind him.Tidal waves of shock coursed through his heart, and when he returned to the front desk, he slumped as if he\u2019d lost his soul.The daughter of the Yuan Family has made him her guest of honor, and the young master of the Zhang Family came to apologize to him in person? Since when was Su Yi in such high demand?Yue Tianhe just couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it.It took me decades of bitter toil just to become the owner of the Immortal Gathering House. How old is that kid? Yet he\u2019s already extended his reach to two of the prefectural capital\u2019s peak-level factions\u2026 It\u2019s really\u2026. It really makes no damn sense!When he compared himself to Su Yi, Yue Tianhe couldn\u2019t help but feel as if he\u2019d lived all these years in vain.Seth's ThoughtsThe author seems to have switched \"Elder Xiong\" for \"Uncle Xiong.\" Let's wait a few chapters and see which one he settles into. Then, I'll go back and clarify.Writing this mostly to say that yes, they're the same person. This is a (minor) author error. I would guess it's because of \"Uncle Yong\". Uncle Xiong is like Zhang Yuanxing's Uncle Yong equivalent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Guests Arrive One After Another, Each With a Load on his MindA while passed before Yue Tianhe calmed down.After a moment\u2019s thought, he waved over some of the servants and ordered, \u201cOne of you is to go to the city lord\u2019s manor, another to the Li Family, and another to the Huang Family. Say Yuan Luoxi of the Yuan Family and Young Master Zhang Yuanxing of the Zhang Family are currently dining at our Immortal Gathering House. There\u2019s no need to say anything beyond that.\u201cI have only one request: be quick about it!\u201dThe servants scampered off to obey his orders.With this, Fu Shan, Li Tianhan, and Huang Yunchong will all owe me a favor. Furthermore, I can borrow the prestige of the Yuan and Zhang families to boost the Immortal Gathering House\u2019s reputation. Two birds, one stone\u2026.\u00a0The more he thought about it, the better Yue Tianhe felt.He was well aware that Fu Shan, Li Tianhan, and Huang Yuanchong would all jump at this opportunity to build a connection with the Yuan and Zhang families.\u00a0Even if they failed to build any real connection, they could at least get familiar.The only one Yue Tianhe didn\u2019t send a servant to inform was Wen Changjing of the Wen Family.His reasoning was simple: to the best of his knowledge, the Wen Family looked down on their live-in son-in-law more than anyone.\u00a0If Yue Tianhe sent someone to inform them, it would almost inevitably lead to misunderstandings.\u2026.The private room on the second floor.Zhang Yuanxing apologized, and without any regard for whether or not Su Yi accepted his apology, he turned his full attention toward Yuan Luoxi.Although Yuan Luoxi was inwardly impatient, she worried losing her temper would make her look bad in front of Su Yi, so she had no choice but to endure.\u00a0Any other time, she would have already flipped the table over and stormed off.Meanwhile, Cheng Wuyong went on chatting and drinking with Su Yi. But then, he was the one doing most of the talking; Su Yi rarely opened his mouth.As he watched this play out, Uncle Xiong couldn\u2019t help but find it strange.\u00a0Even if Su Yi had done the Yuan Family a huge favor in Mother Ghost Ridge, surely there was no need for Cheng Wuyong to treat him with\u00a0this\u00a0much fervor, right?As for Su Yi, he occasionally broke his silence to bump glasses with Guo Bing and say a few casual words.\u00a0He could tell that although the elderly medicine picker was enjoying his meal, he was very reserved; he didn\u2019t even dare so much as breathe too loudly.Guo Bing noticed what Su Yi was doing, and it made him feel warm inside.He was just a low-status medicine picker. The grand fortune of dining with so many distinguished people felt unreal, almost as if he were dreaming.But his position was so humble, and he was just an ordinary person. It was inevitable that the others would overlook him.\u00a0Only Su Yi was willing to chat and drink with him. This made him feel respected, and he felt warm and fuzzy inside.Suddenly, Yue Tianhe\u2019s humble, impassioned voice rang out from just outside the door.\u00a0\u201cDistinguished guests, City Lord Fu Shan and Commander Nie Beihu have arrived.\u201dSu Yi glanced at Yuan Luoxi and Zhang Yuanxing, then understood.\u00a0I\u2019m afraid Fu Shan is here for them.\u201cWhat\u2019s Fu Shan doing here?\u201d Zhang Yuanxing furrowed his brow. He\u2019d been chatting away happily, delighted at this chance to get closer to Yuan Luoxi, only for someone to interrupt them. This left him feeling deeply displeased.But then Su Yi rose to welcome Fu Shan personally.And Yuan Luoxi, who\u2019d been watching him this entire time, reacted instantly. Her pretty eyes focused, and she shot to her feet, then beat him to the door.When she saw Fu Shan standing outside, the girl in military attire smiled sweetly. \u201cCity Lord Fu, I\u2019d planned to pay you a visit, but you came to see me before I got the chance. Please, take a seat.\u201dFu Shan froze momentarily, both stunned and flattered, then clasped his fist. \u201cMiss Yuan, I\u2019ll be satisfied so long as you don\u2019t fault me for showing up uninvited.\u201dHe and Nie Biehu stepped into the room.The sight of Su Yi in the seat of honor was obviously unexpected. The two of them looked at each other, and their gazes underwent a subtle shift.But then, both were long accustomed to occasions of all sorts, so they quickly repressed their inner confusion and smiled in greeting. \u201cSo you\u2019re here too, Young Lord Su.\u201dSu Yi smiled and nodded back.But that was just the beginning. Against all expectations, the Immortal Gathering House was lively as could be today.Shortly after Fu Shan and Nie Beihu, Huang Yunchong arrived, Huan Qianjun in tow.Just like Fu Shan, when they saw Su Yi in the seat of honor, they couldn\u2019t help but gasp, and their hearts shook.They\u2019d long since known that Su Yi had the Spiritjade Marchioness behind him, but they wouldn\u2019t have expected even the young miss of the Yuan Family and the young master of the Zhang Family to make him the guest of honor!Not much later, Family Head Li Tianhan arrived as well.When he saw the scene within the private dining room, he was flabbergasted. Waves coursed through his heart, and he couldn\u2019t calm himself down.So many major powers, yet Su Yi was the one at the head of the table. What was going on?Despite his vast breadth of experience and vast array of knowledge, he couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it.By now, with the sole exception of Wen Changjing, all of the most important people in Guangling City were present.\u00a0Any one of them could shake the entire city with a single stomp of their foot!But today, they could only sit in the last and least prestigious seats of the private dining room.This was quite interesting.Su Yi sat at the head of the table. Yuan Luoxi and Zhang Yuanxing sat to his sides, followed by Cheng Wuyong, Uncle Xiong, and Guo Bing.By the time Fu Shan and the others arrived, they could only take the remaining seats.The atmosphere in the private dining room instantly dulled. It was a bit strange; although everyone was still chatting, all of them had something else on their minds.Yuan Luoxi and Cheng Wuyong wanted to get closer to Su Yi, and they were wondering how best to chat and share a few more drinks with him without revealing his secrets.Zhang Yuanxing was fully fixated on Yuan Luoxi.Fu Shan, Nie Beihu, Huang Yunchong, and the others subconsciously assumed that Su Yi\u2019s position at the head of the table was due to Yuan\u00a0Luoxi\u00a0and Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s respect for him.Li Tianhan thought the same, but he was already starting to wonder if he should stop his son from intervening in Su Yi\u2019s marriage after all\u2026Guo Bing was increasingly reserved, and he looked unsettled.\u00a0He felt like an ant who\u2019d wandered into a banquet of dragons; everyone present was someone he could only gaze upon from afar. It was easy to imagine how tense he felt.Only Su Yi remained perfectly calm.\u00a0His heart was like a mirror; he could roughly deduce everyone\u2019s thoughts, and he couldn\u2019t help but find it funny.\u00a0This was what it meant to be a martial artist of the mundane world. They could never escape the shackles of authority, prestige, profit, and desire.It\u2019s important to know that cultivation was, at its core, a rebellion against fate!If you wanted to reach greater heights of the Dao and become a peerless, ageless, indestructible, and eternal existence, you\u2019d inevitably have to sever your ties to the trivial affairs of mundanity.So-called authority, fame, fortune, love, and lust\u2026. They were like flowers reflected in a mirror or the moon reflected in the water, fleeting and immaterial.Only one\u2019s own strength was a firm foundation upon which to establish oneself. Only this would never change!Meanwhile, outside the restaurant.Wen Jueyuan rushed over to the Immortal Gathering House, then stopped outside. He led a group of Wen Family guards.Wen Jueyuan forcefully repressed his excitement and asked solemnly, \u201cAre you certain that Su Yi is inside?\u201dHis father, Wen Changjing, had returned from Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy just last night, and he brought with him news so wondrous, it left the entire Wen Family overcome with excitement.Furthermore, that very night, Wen Changjing held a family-wide meeting. It was then that he learned of Su Yi taking first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. He immediately ordered Su Yi to come see him in the clan\u2019s great hall.But at the time, Su Yi wasn\u2019t at the Apricot Clinic.Finally, this morning, Wen Jueyuan heard from his subordinates that Su Yi had been sighted. That was why Wen Jueyuan rushed right over to the Immortal Gathering Horse.\u201cYoung Master, just fifteen minutes ago, I happened to pass by the Immortal Gathering House, and I saw Su Yi and a group of others enter the restaurant. There\u2019s no mistake!\u201d the attendant hurriedly made a solemn guarantee.\u201cExcellent!\u201d Wen Jueyuan hesitated no further. He led his people directly into the restaurant.\u201cYoung Master Wen?\u201d Yue Tianhe exclaimed. \u2018What are you\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhich room is Su Yi in?\u201d said Wen Jueyuan coldly.\u201cNaturally, the first private room on the second floor\u2026.\u201d\u00a0As soon as Yue Tianhe said this, he saw Wen Jueyuan lead his guards up to the stairs. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cHey! Young Master Wen, wait! What are you here to do?\u201dWen Jueyuan ignored him.He was completely focused on dragging Su Yi back to the Wen Family for his father and uncle to deal with!When he reached the private room, Wen Jueyuan stood outside the door. He heard conversation and laughter on the other side, and he laughed coldly to himself,\u00a0Su Yi, let\u2019s see if you can still laugh when we\u2019re through with you!He took a deep breath, put his hands behind his back, and glanced meaningfully at the two guards beside him.Bang!They suddenly pushed the door open.The room instantly fell silent as everyone turned their attention to the doorway.\u201cSu\u2026.\u201d Wen Jueyuan cleared his throat and was just about to bellow for Su Yi to come out, but when he saw just who was seated in this private dining room, the words stuck in his throat, and his eyes widened.It was as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning; his legs quivered beneath his robe, and sweat poured down his back.He\u2019d been struck dumb.\u201cWen Jueyuan, what are you doing?\u201d Yuan Luoxi\u2019s willowy eyebrows knit together, and her pretty eyes glinted with anger.\u201cI\u2026..\u201d Wen Jueyuan gulped. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were here, Miss Luoxi.\u201dHis gaze swept across the room. The world seemed to darken with each familiar face he saw.City Lord Fu Shan, Commander Nie Beihu, Family Head Huang Yunchong, Family Head Li Tianhan, Yuan Luoxi of the prefectural capital\u2019s Yuan Family\u2026.Although he didn\u2019t recognize Zhang Yuanxing or his Uncle Xiong, Wen Jueyuan knew that just being at such a feast was proof of their lofty status!\u201cWho is this barbarian?\u201d said Zhang Yuanxing, his expression dark and unfriendly.\u201cWen Jueyuan, the son of the head of the Wen Family.\u201d Huang Qianjun laughed as if twisting a knife. \u201cI\u2019m surprised; when did the leading figure of the Wen Family\u2019s younger generation become so ill-mannered?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Shock and fury overlapped in Wen Jueyuan\u2019s heart, but when he saw Huang\u00a0Yunchong\u2019s\u00a0cold glare, he trembled.\u201cEven your father, Wen Changjing, isn\u2019t as brazen as you!\u201d City Lord Fu Shan said expressionlessly.Nie Beihu, Li Tianhan, and the others all looked at him with unconcealed displeasure.Wen Jueyuan felt as if the world were spinning around him. His heart was on the verge of collapse.How could he possibly have guessed that so many major powers would be gathered in this one room?\u201cGet the hell out of here!\u201d shouted Zhang Yuanxing.It was just a few words, but as humiliating as they were, Wen Jueyuan felt as if he\u2019d received an imperial pardon.However, just as he was about to lead his people away, Yuan Luoxi said coldly, \u201cWait. You still haven\u2019t told us why you\u2019re here.\u201dWen Jueyuan\u2019s entire body went rigid. He scanned this gathering of influential figures, then looked at Su Yi, who sat among them. His lips quivered, and he lowered his head and said bitterly, \u201cMiss Luoxi, my father returned from Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy last night, and he said he wanted to see Su Yi, but Su Yi wasn\u2019t around. Just now, I heard that he\u2019d been spotted at the Immortal Gathering House, so I came here to tell him to hurry home as soon as possible\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - A Brief Absence, a Whole-New PersonWen Jueyuan\u2019s heart quivered.The private dining room was unusually silent. It seemed they didn\u2019t quite believe it.\u00a0Wen Jueyuan came here with such ferocity\u2026. Just to call Su Yi back home?If that\u2019s all it was, why not send a servant to notify him? Why come with so many guards and cause such a disturbance?Yuan Luoxi seemed to have sensed that something was amiss too. She couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat is your family head summoning Young Lord Su for?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wen Jueyuan found himself at a loss for words.\u201cEnough,\u201d said Su Yi flatly. \u201cGo back and report to your father. Say I\u2019ll be there in a little while.\u201dBut Wen Jueyuan just glanced at Yuan Luoxi. It was obvious that he didn\u2019t care what Su Yi said; he only cared about her opinion!Fu Shan, Huang Yunchong, and the others inwardly shook their heads.\u00a0This Wen Jueyuan\u2019s powers of discernment are truly lacking! Hasn\u2019t he realized the implications of Su Yi sitting in the seat of honor?Yuan Luoxi pondered for a moment, then said coldly, \u201cIn Mother Ghost Ridge, Young Lord Su and Guo Bing did us an enormous favor. This banquet was arranged specifically to thank them. If your Wen Family has any objections, you\u2019re welcome to come looking for me.\u201dShe waved him away. \u201cGo on. Leave.\u201dWen Jueyuan reacted as if he\u2019d been granted an imperial pardon. He led his people and hurried away.After this little interlude, Su Yi was in no mood to eat anymore, so shortly after, he rose and bade the others farewell.\u00a0Yuan Luoxi, Fu Shan, Huang Yunchong, and the others hurriedly rose to see him off.Only Zhang Yuanxing was inwardly displeased.\u00a0If you want to leave, just leave! Do you really need everyone to see you out the door?But when he saw everyone else follow Su Yi out of the private room, he could only sigh to himself and follow them. No matter what, he had to consider his bearing.Outside the Immortal Gathering House.\u201cYoung Lord Su, we\u2019ll be leaving Guangling City today. Should you ever visit the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, please give us the chance to show off our hospitality,\u201d said Yuan Luoxi seriously.\u201cIn the prefectural capital, our Yuan Family has a certain degree of influence. If you ever need us, we won\u2019t refuse,\u201d said Cheng Wuyong, cupping his fist solemnly.\u201cLet\u2019s leave it up to fate.\u201d Su Yi waved, gripped his bamboo staff, and walked into the distance.It was only after he disappeared from view that Yuan Luoxi looked away. \u201cUncle Yong, how about we gather our things and head out too?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Cheng Wuyong nodded.Zhang Yuanxing said hurriedly, \u201cLuoxi, I\u2019m planning to return to the prefectural capital today too. This\u2019ll work out perfectly! We can keep each other company on our way back.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Without Su Yi around, Yuan Luoxi instantly recovered her proud, cold, spoiled-little-princess attitude. She turned and walked off.Zhang Yuanxing was just about to follow her when she whipped around and aimed a kick directly at his crotch.He shrunk back in terror, dodging just in time. His forehead broke into cold sweats.If a kick like that hit its mark\u2026. Just the thought made him cringe.\u201cDo you have\u00a0any\u00a0idea how hard it was putting up with you for that long? You\u2019d better not follow me around anymore!\u201d Yuan Luoxi snorted and stormed off.Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s expression flitted back and forth, a mixture of shame and rage.Fu Shan, Nie Beihu, and the others were nearby, but although their expressions went a little strange, they didn\u2019t dare laugh for fear of setting Zhang Yuanxing off.Uncle Xiong walked up to him and sighed. \u201cYoung Master, you ought to understand how unruly Yuan Luoxi is now, right? If you ask me, you\u2019d be better off avoiding her. When that girl takes action, she doesn\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t get it. Why did her attitude change so quickly? Back at the banquet, she wasn\u2019t that way at all,\u201d sulked Zhang Yuanxing.\u201cSu Yi isn\u2019t around anymore, so she felt no more need to hide anything.\u201d How shrewd and experienced was Uncle Xiong? He\u2019d long since picked up numerous clues. Although he couldn\u2019t deduce the whole picture, that didn\u2019t stop him from making this judgment.\u201cBecause of Su Yi?\u201d Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s expression darkened. He thought back to how Yuan Luoxi had behaved back at the Immortal Gathering House, recalling everything in detail.And indeed, he discovered that her behavior changed when Su Yi was around. She was respectful, with a hint of admiration in the mix. Even her behavior became modest and reserved.But when she faced him, she was blunt and put no thought into her words. It was all just perfunctory\u2026.Realizing this, Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s fists clenched, and an irrepressible wave of jealousy and fury coursed through his heart.\u201cUncle Xiong,\u201d he said stiffly, as if he\u2019d made up his mind. \u201cArrange another meeting with Su Yi tonight. I want the truth!\u201dUncle Xiong fell silent, then nodded.\u00a0His heart was full of doubt. He, too, wanted answers from Su Yi.For example, what exactly had happened in Mother Ghost Ridge to make Yuan Luoxi and Cheng Wuyong treat Su Yi with such respect?\u2026\u2026On his way back to the Wen Family, Su Yi couldn\u2019t suppress his anticipation.Lingxue, that girl. She\u2019s been gone for over half a month. It\u2019s been so long! This place is really missing something without her around.Mm, when I see her, I\u2019ll have to check up on how her cultivation is going.And before I leave Guangling City, I\u2019ll have to give her some spiritual medicines and spirit stones. That way, she won\u2019t have to worry about her cultivation for a while.Also, her monthly spending money is only a few hundred taels of silver. I\u2019ll have to leave her some silver notes, too.Oh, and I should prepare some defensive treasures for her. That way, if she runs into danger, she can protect herself even if I\u2019m not around.And I\u2019ll have to trouble Fu Shan to keep an eye on her in my absence\u2026Similar thoughts raced through Su Yi\u2019s head, and he was back at the Wen Family estate before he knew it. He went straight toward Wen Changtai and Qin Qing\u2019s residence.\u201cSir, you\u2019re back?\u201d When they saw Su Yi return, the two servant girls cleaning the courtyard were startled, and they hurriedly called out to him in greeting.Who in the Wen Family didn\u2019t know about Su Yi taking first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet?\u00a0This news had resulted in a stark difference in how the servants treated Su Yi.\u201cIs Lingxue home?\u201d asked Su Yi.Before the servant could respond, Qin Qing\u2019s shrewish voice rang out from within the atrium. \u201cYou\u2019re finally back, you moocher?\u201dEven as she spoke, Qin Qing stormed outside. She\u2019d been gone for a while, but she seemed like an entirely different person. She looked radiant with happiness and full of spirit, while her make-up was unusually exquisite, making her look even more beautiful than usual. Her every moment was stylish and showy.She looked Su Yi up and down, then snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t think you can walk around with your head held high just because you took first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. That\u2019s nothing compared to Lingzhao\u2019s current status and reputation!\u201dSu Yi smiled, not the least bit concerned.His mother-in-law was always like this. Fiery, unreasonable, and foul-mouthed, but not a bad person at heart.In the year following his marriage into the Wen Family, despite Qin Qing\u2019s deep resentment over this arrangement and despite her utter disdain for her \u201ccrippled\u201d live-in son-in-law, she\u2019d never really been cruel to himThis was why Su Yi couldn\u2019t be bothered to get even with her.\u201cCome with me.\u201d When she saw that Su Yi behaved just as he had before\u2014when she saw that he wasn\u2019t talking back\u2014Qin Qing inwardly sighed in relief, and her expression mellowed somewhat.She\u2019d only returned home last night. It was then that she heard of Su Yi\u2019s shocking performance at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet for the first time. At the time, she\u2019d been overcome with shock. This revelation delighted her, but it worried her too.She was happy to learn that Su Yi wasn\u2019t a good-for-nothing after all, but she was worried that after this stellar performance, Su Yi might not respect his in-laws anymore.Looking at him now, it seemed as if he hadn\u2019t changed much. Just like before, he didn\u2019t seem to mind her mockery or chastisements in the least.They entered the atrium, where Wen Changtai was drinking tea. When he saw Su Yi, he smiled and got to his feet. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve risen to prominence too! That\u2019s great.\u201dSu Yi couldn\u2019t help but laugh.This father-in-law of his was intriguing; he was honest and unexceptional, with no grand ambitions. Many other members of the Wen Family looked down on him.But in Su Yi\u2019s eyes, Wen Changtai had a strong point too: his kindness.He\u2019d never been cold or harsh, not even to his live-in son-in-law.It seemed Wen Lingxue had inherited her pure-hearted kindness from her father.\u201cSu Yi, in any event, as parents, we\u2019re happy to see you recover your cultivation.\u201d Qin Qing sat down, then paused to organize her thoughts. \u201cIn the past, your father-in-law and I might have treated you poorly. Going forward, we\u2019ll do our best to remedy that, but you\u2019d best understand this now: with Lingzhao\u2019s personality, it\u2019s simply not possible for her to accept you. I just hope this won\u2019t lead to resentment.\u201dSu Yi keenly picked up on the change in Qin Qing\u2019s attitude.He said offhandedly, \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking this. I\u2019ve never cared whether or not Wen Lingzhao accepted me.\u201dQin Qing sighed, \u201cNow that I think about it, you and Lingzhao are both victims of this arranged marriage. I\u2019ve wanted to dissolve this marriage contract for a long time, but the matriarch refused to let me. No matter how great my resentment, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d said Su Yi flatly.\u201cAlso, there\u2019s something I need to tell you straight,\u201d murmured Qin Qing. \u201cDuring our visit to Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, Lingzhao said she\u2019d consider every possible option to annul this marriage. But don\u2019t misunderstand; she doesn\u2019t hate you, but rather the marriage itself. To her, you\u2019re ultimately just a stranger.\u201dAgainst Qin Qing\u2019s expectations, Su Yi didn\u2019t get angry. He only laughed, \u201cShe wants to dissolve our marriage? I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dThis response actually made Qin Qing a bit uncomfortable.\u00a0Does this kid think that just because he took first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, he\u2019s hot stuff? Is he that eager to draw a line between himself and our family?Also, Lingzhao isn\u2019t just gorgeous; she\u2019s even a Grandmaster\u2019s disciple! Over in Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, countless talented youths are pursuing her. Is she that unappealing to you?After calming herself, she continued, \u201cSu Yi, I\u2019ve already said everything I need to say. Soon, the family head will summon you directly. I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t be happy, either. You\u2019d best mentally prepare yourself.\u201dWhy would Su Yi concern himself with something like that? He just asked directly, \u201cWhere\u2019s Lingxue?\u201dQin Qing was dazed.\u00a0He\u2019s really got the energy to spare thinking of my other daughter even at a time like this?Wen Changtai\u2019s warm voice chimed in, \u201cLingxue remained at Blueriver Sword Manor to continue her cultivation. Lingzhao said she plans to arrange for her sister to enter Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy in the near future, so Lingxue won\u2019t return to Guangling City any time soon.\u201dSu Yi suddenly fell silent. All that expectation, all for nothing. His brow furrowed.\u201cLingzhao is doing this for her sister\u2019s sake,\u201d said Qin Qing. \u201cBack then, she was helpless as the family forced her into marriage against her will. How could she possibly let the same fate befall her little sister? If Lingxue remains in Guangling City, what will she do if the matriarch arranges a marriage for her next?\u201dWhen Su Yi heard this, he understood. Wen Lingxue hadn\u2019t remained behind of her own volition; her sister had made these arrangements for her.Seth's ThoughtsThe bit about Yuan Luoxi attempting to kick Zhang Yuanxing in the balls includes a pun that I am not smart enough to translate cleverly.\u5f53\u673a\u7acb\u65ad is an idiom that means \u201cto make a prompt decision.\u201d\u88c6\u9e21\u7acb\u65ad is internet slang that\u2019s pronounced the exact same way, right down to the tones, except they replaced two of the characters with words that refer to the male genitilia. \u65ad can mean \u201cdecide\u201d but it can also mean \u201csever\u201d or \u201csnap.\u201d So this new idiom means \u201ca swift kick to the balls\u201d or really any other sudden, grievous harm to a certain very sensitive part of a man\u2019s body.If you google the term, you\u2019ll find lots of painful-looking videos. Consider yourselves duly warned!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - As a Live-in Son-in-Law, Your Life and Death are out of Your HandsThis works too. I\u2019ll be going to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital soon anyway, so I\u2019ll be able to visit Lingxue at Blueriver Sword Manor regularly\u2026\u00a0Su Yi suddenly relaxed significantly.Qin Qing hesitated for a moment, her beautiful face suddenly solemn. \u201cSu Yi, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201dQin Qing said, \u201cIn the year since your marriage into the Wen Family, have you\u2026 Have you ever resented us?\u201dSu Yi shook his head.\u00a0To the person he\u2019d become, no one in the Wen Family was worthy of his resentment.What did it mean to resent someone?It meant you couldn\u2019t let something go!This was something Su Xuanjun only felt when he encountered an enemy he temporarily couldn\u2019t overcome. Only then would he carry resentment in his heart.As for minor figures he could easily dispose of, people he could turn to ash in minutes? He couldn\u2019t possibly\u00a0resent\u00a0them.\u201cYou really don\u2019t?\u201d Qin Qing didn\u2019t quite seem to believe it.Su Yi sighed in exasperation. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201dThis was what they meant when they said \u201cSummer insects don\u2019t speak of ice, and cicadas know nothing of spring or fall.\u201dQin Qing visibly relaxed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t harbor resentment in your heart, you shouldn\u2019t bring disaster upon us. After all, aren\u2019t we victims of this marriage arrangement too? If you want to blame someone, you should blame\u2026.\u201dShe was just about to say \u201cthe matriarch\u201d when her mouth clamped shut.\u00a0Finishing that thought would be too disrespectful!Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re trying to say. I have no reason to keep this from you: I\u2019ll be leaving Guangling City in the near future, and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t come back. You can relax knowing that, yeah?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d exclaimed Qin Qing. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dWen Changtai couldn\u2019t help but look over. \u201cYou\u2019re the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law. With the marriage contract still in place, I\u2019m afraid the family head won\u2019t let you leave so easily.\u201d\u201cIf I want to leave,\u201d said Su Yi, \u201cNo one in this world can stop me.\u201dHis tone was casual, but his words revealed his confidence and disdain.Qin Qing and Wen Changtai glanced at each other, obviously caught off guard. Neither of them could have anticipated that Su Yi had such plans.It was then that a servant rushed in and reported, \u201cThird Elder, the family head has ordered Su Yi to see him in the clan\u2019s great hall.\u201dQin Qing\u2019s expression shifted, and she hurriedly reminded Su Yi, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the warning I gave you just now. I\u2019m afraid the family head won\u2019t let you off lightly. You\u2019d best bite your tongue and endure; don\u2019t talk back. If you do, not even your father-in-law and I will be able to help you.\u201dWen Changtai nodded repeatedly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Endure, and it\u2019ll be over soon. A true man knows when to lower his head; that\u2019s the smartest way to live your life.\u201dThis was Su Yi\u2019s first time experiencing his in-laws\u2019 concern. Despite his momentary surprise, he soon shook his head and laughed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201dWith that, he gripped his bamboo staff and left the atrium.\u2026.The Wen Family, the clan hall.Family Head Wen Changjing, Second Elder Wen Changqing, and several other Wen Family higher-ups had gathered inside.It was just, all of their expressions were stunned and uncertain.Wen Jueyuan sat in the last, lowest-ranked seat, looking bewildered.He\u2019d just repeated everything he\u2019d experienced in the Immortal Gathering House, but even now, he felt an indescribable sense of frustration, dejection, and shame.\u201cWhat dog-shit good luck! That Su Yi actually managed to sink his claws in the prefectural capital\u2019s Yuan Family?\u201d Wen Changqing\u2019s expression was sour and unsightly.The others found it hard to calm down too.The live-in son-in-law they\u2019d always ignored had, just a few days prior, taken first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, becoming a household name and a famed rising star overnight.Now, just a few days after that, this live-in son-in-law had established a connection with the daughter of the Yuan Family. This was enough to surprise anyone!\u201cThe medicine picker, Guo Bing, helped Young Miss Yuan too. From the look of things, it seems that Su Yi hasn\u2019t really \u2018established a relationship' with her. He\u2019s at most won her recognition and appreciation,\u201d said Wen Changjing indifferently. \u201cI called you all here to discuss what we should do with Su Yi.\u201dThe crowd\u2019s eyes flashed with thoughtful light.\u201cHe\u2019s not the waste he was once. On the contrary, his cultivation base is a bit stronger than even\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s. Throughout our entire younger generation, I\u2019m afraid only Lingzhao can compete with him,\u201d said an elder gravely. \u201cIf you ask me, if we treat him with importance, we can train a talent of his caliber into a highly useful member of the family!\u201dWhen he heard this, Wen Changjing furrowed his brow, and Wen Jueyuan felt stifled. He was the leading figure of the family\u2019s younger generation, but now, others saw him as no more than Su Yi\u2019s stepping stone!\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d said someone else. \u201cThe boy\u2019s schemes run too deep. Before he took first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, none of us knew he\u2019d recovered. We still don\u2019t know when he regained his cultivation. Furthermore, he\u2019s been insulted and denigrated ever since he married into the family; I\u2019m afraid his heart is already full of accumulated resentment!\u00a0Putting him in a position of power would be no different from raising a tiger; he\u2019ll just turn around and bite us. It would be the height of foolishness.\u201dThis argument won quite a few people\u2019s approval.This was a young man who surely already resented them, someone who knew how to endure in silence. As soon as he\u2019d accumulated enough power, his revenge was sure to be incomparably terrifying. It would be unavoidable and difficult to guard against.\u201cIf you ask me,\u201d said someone else, \u201cWe should just kick him out of the family, draw a line between him and us, and be done with it.\u201dAnother immediately argued, \u201cRidiculous! Su Yi just took first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, and City Lord Fu Shan thinks highly of him. Even the Huang Family favors him. If we expel him from the family, we\u2019ll become the laughingstocks of the entire city!\u201dSoon, the entire hall was in uproar as the family higher-ups\u00a0argued\u00a0amongst themselves, unable to reach an agreement.Wen Changjing\u2019s expression darkened in response.\u00a0Who would have thought that a mere live-in son-in-law already had enough influence to affect the family higher-ups to this degree?\u201cEnough!\u201d Wen Changjing suddenly spoke up and suppressed all other voices. \u201cI\u2019ve already decided.\u201dEveryone froze, stunned.\u201cElder Brother, what do you plan to do?\u201d Wen Changqing couldn\u2019t help but ask. The others pricked up their ears as well.\u201cThe matriarch won\u2019t agree to simply dissolve Su Yi\u2019s wedding contract. In that case, we can\u2019t just exile him either.\u201d Wen Changjing took a deep breath, and his eyes glinted. \u201cBut if we give him too much power, it really will be no different from raising an untamed tiger. In that case, we need someone to keep a leash on him and make sure he puts his fangs to use for the family\u2019s benefit!\u201dAs soon as he said this, a servant solemnly reported from beyond the hall, \u201cFamily Head, the Wen Family son-in-law, Su Yi, has arrived!\u201dWhoosh!\u201dEveryone looked over and saw Su Yi\u2019s tall, lean figure, his long hair pinned up. His robes were jade-green, neat, and clean, and he had an indifferent, detached air.He approached, leisurely and unhurried, carrying a bamboo walking stick. He completely disregarded the crowd\u2019s gazes as he strolled into the hall.When they saw this, many of the family higher-ups looked conflicted.\u00a0If only this kid were surnamed \u2018Wen\u2019.....\u201cWhat did you want to see me about?\u201d Su Yi stood in the center of the hall, hands behind his back, staring directly at Wen Changjing. He offered no respectful greeting, nor did he lower his head. He just got straight to the point.Wen Changjing\u2019s face twitched subtly. \u201cWhen I got back last night, I heard that you recovered your cultivation, and that you took first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cYou outshadowed every other competitor. I called you here, first to congratulate you on becoming a martial artist once more, and second, to share a piece of good news.\u201d\u201cGood news?\u201d Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to clean out my ears and listen up.\u201dHis words carried a hint of sarcasm, which made many of the listeners uncomfortable.Wen Jueyuan\u2019s expression darkened.\u00a0This Su Yi\u2026. Just how brazen is he?But\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changjing didn\u2019t linger on that. He continued, \u201cJust now, the elders and I discussed the matter. Starting tomorrow, you\u2019ll be the younger generation\u2019s captain of the guards. You\u2019ll receive eight thousand taels of silver per month, as well as a stalk of spiritual medicine, and you\u2019ll be assigned eight servants. How does that sound?\u201dEveryone turned to look at Su Yi.These conditions weren\u2019t\u00a0that\u00a0lavish, but they weren\u2019t shoddy, either.But Su Yi merely froze. \u201cYou\u2019re planning to put me to work for the Wen Family?\u201dWen Changqing snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re\u00a0our\u00a0live-in son-in-law. Working for us is the natural order of things. What\u2019s so inappropriate about that?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re displeased with the conditions I\u2019ve offered you, please feel free to say so,\u201d said Wen Changjing, feigning magnanimity. \u201cI just have one request: once you begin your role as the younger generation\u2019s captain of the guard, you are to obey Jueyuan\u2019s orders. You are to ensure his safety, but you are not to go against his commands. You\u2019re both young, so I trust that the two of you will get along.\u201dWhen they heard this, the crowd instantly understood.\u00a0The family head is planning to have\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u00a0keep\u00a0a leash on Su Yi!As the captain of the guards, Su Yi would be like a sharp sword in Wen Jueyuan\u2019s hand!The family head really is shrewd. He\u2019s essentially just paved his son\u2019s way forward. With a tough customer like Su Yi under his command, what need will Wen Jueyuan have to worry about maintaining his position as the next family head?\u00a0Many of them sighed with emotion.Wen Jueyuan was briefly dazed, but then, he practically went mad with delight.\u00a0Even he would never have guessed that his father would make such a wondrous arrangement.\u00a0Doesn't this mean that Su Yi is to become my underling?It won\u2019t matter that Su Yi has the higher cultivation. Even if Su Yi were tougher than he already is, in terms of rank, he\u2019ll still be a full head lower than me!The more he thought about it, the more excited\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan felt. It was as if his father\u2019s words had swept away all the stifled anger and dark clouds he\u2019d accumulated over the past few days. His whole body relaxed.But it was then that Su Yi couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. He burst into laughter. \u201cWen Jueyuan? What even is he? Is he worthy of my allegiance?\u201dThe entire hall fell silent.Everyone was flabbergasted; they almost didn\u2019t dare believe their ears.Wen Jueyuan was the heir of the family head, the future leader of the Wen Family. How could Su Yi say something so depraved?Wen Jueyuan had been brimming with excitement just seconds before, but now, he practically jumped up and down with rage. He couldn\u2019t help but bellow, \u201cSu Yi, cease your impudence!\u201dSu Yi sighed, his gaze pitying. \u201cHow could you be this stupid? Didn\u2019t you learn anything from what happened at the Immortal Gathering House this morning? Anything at all?\u201dBang!Wen Changjing slammed his chair\u2019s armrests, shattering them. He glowered, his expression terrifyingly dark. \u201cSu Yi! Don\u2019t forget your position! Not even the daughter of the Yuan Family can intervene in our family\u2019s private affairs!\u201dHe continued icily, \u201cAlso, City Lord Fu Shan cannot help you here. No matter what, you\u2019re still the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law, and the Wen Family is well within its rights to discipline you as it pleases. I advise you to behave yourself!\u201dHis words were cold and callous, and they carried a blatant threat.The Wen Family higher-ups\u2019 expressions frosted over.This live-in son-in-law has clearly let his pride go to his head. Does he really think that finding a backer or two is enough to let him overturn the heavens?According to the laws of the Great Zhou, a live-in son-in-law\u2019s fate is under the control of the family he marries into. We can kill and cripple him as we please, and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Kneel, or DieAn incident once shook the entire Great Zhou.A young man who\u2019d married into the imperial family and become the imperial son-in-law couldn\u2019t handle the rules and restrictions that came with his new position and attempted to dissolve his marriage, only for his in-laws to order his dismemberment by five horses!This was the fate of the live-in son-in-law.And in the eyes of the Wen Family, no matter how exceptional Su Yi became, he was still just their live-in son-in-law, and his fate was still firmly within their grasp.\u00a0Even if they killed him, no one would point the finger at their Wen Family.Thus, despite knowing that Su Yi had recovered his cultivation, that Fu Shan thought highly of him, that Huang Yunchong favored him, and that the daughter of the Yuan Family admired him, Wen Changjing wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned.This was a private family matter!Wen Changjing certainly didn\u2019t think the likes of Fu Shan and Huang Yunchong would have a falling out with the Wen Family over a mere Su Yi.Of course, that was only the worst-case scenario.Wen Changjing was confident that in the face of such terror, Su Yi, a seventeen-year-old, would cave beneath the pressure and obediently accept the conditions he offered.The atmosphere within the great hall was stifled. A chill hung in the air.But Su Yi didn\u2019t seem to mind. On the contrary, he sighed. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that if I don\u2019t agree, you people won\u2019t ever let me hear the end of it?\u201d\u201cSu Yi, you were once a prominent young talent, and you once fell back into obscurity. Now, you\u2019ve finally become a martial artist once more. It can\u2019t have been easy; don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know how to cherish your good fortune? I urge you to hurry and lower your head; don\u2019t provoke our family head any further!\u201d said an elder coldly.Another sighed, \u201cYoung man, remember these words: you have to know when to lower your head if you want to live to a ripe old age. If your success makes you insolent, you\u2019re certain to put your life at risk.\u201d\u201cSu Yi, what do you have to be dissatisfied about?\u201d someone snorted coldly. \u201cBecoming the younger generation\u2019s captain of the guards is an honor. Don\u2019t you know what\u2019s good for you?\u201dIt was then that Wen Jueyuan rose as well. \u201cSu Yi, if you\u2019ve really got the guts, go ahead and refuse. I dare guarantee that if you do, you won\u2019t leave our clan hall in one piece.He sounded awfully pleased with himself, and inside, he was indeed as pleased as punch.But Su Yi merely swept his gaze around the room, his expression gradually dulling. His\u00a0inscrutably\u00a0deep pupils were already utterly indifferent.He glanced at his bamboo staff, then smiled faintly. \u201cWen Jueyuan, you\u2019ve made yourself quite clear, so I\u2019ll put everything out in the open too. If any member of the Wen Family dares act against me, this place will flow with rivers of blood.Although he smiled, his emotions didn\u2019t so much as ripple.An inexplicable chill coursed through the hearts of all in attendance.Wen Changjing completely lost his temper. \u201cGuards! Seize this scoundrel and throw him in the dungeons! Don\u2019t let him out until he lowers his head and learns penitence!\u00a0\u201cIf he dares resist, kill him where he stands!\u201dThere was an uproar as a group of armed guards charged into the clan hall and surrounded Su Yi.All of them were on guard. They were well aware that Su Yi was no longer the cripple they\u2019d once known; he was the dazzling figure who\u2019d recently claimed first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet!\u201cWen Family Son-in-law, the family head has already graciously granted you an important position. Why must you refuse? I urge you to come quietly. Don\u2019t make this difficult; weapons don\u2019t have eyes. If you get hurt, it won\u2019t be our fault,\u201d said the leader of the guards gravely.As he spoke, all of them surrounded Su Yi, step by step.\u201cTry me,\u201d said Su Yi indifferently.\u201cAttack!\u201d The leader of the guards\u2019 expression darkened, and he hesitated no longer. He and his subordinates all charged at once.Ten or so guards, all of them Wen Family elites. Even the weakest was at the Refining Sinew Stage. All of them charged at once, their swords flashing, the sight terrifying to behold.Clang!Su Yi stood there proudly, unmoving. Mortal Edge emerged from its sheath with a clear hum, as if thirsting for blood.With a shake of his wrist, Mortal Edge arced, leaving afterimages in its wake. In a flash, countless illusory swords struck in all directions.Airy and ethereal, distant and at ease, without the slightest spark, yet omnipresent and inescapable, with a profound charm.My sword wanders the ten directions, from the blue dome of heaven to the yellow springs below!This was the Rejoicing Sword Sutra\u2019s \u201cWandering the Ten Directions\u201d!The name came from the phrase \u201cMy sword wanders the ten directions, with nowhere it cannot reach.\u201dIn his past life, this stance could pierce the limitless heavens and kill his foes from hundreds of thousands of miles away!In its current form, it was nothing but a sword move, but when Su Yi used it, it was far stronger than any ordinary martial arts technique.Clang!The guard leading the charge lost his grip on his weapon. His saber flew through the air as the bones of his right wrist shattered, and a streak of sword light pierced him in the chest. It went three inches into the bone, leaving a bloody gash behind.He screamed, then fell to the ground, writhing in agony.Clang! Clang! Clang!Similar noises rang out in rapid succession. All the guards\u2019 weapons were sent flying.\u00a0Soon, without exception, all of them had three-inch gashes in their chests. The wounds spurted blood as the impact forced them backward.The hall\u2019s chairs, tables, and furnishings were soon nothing but rubble. The floor was covered in ruined furniture.In the time it took to snap your fingers, Su Yi left a dozen or so guards wounded and defeated!As for Su Yi? He stood in place, his clothes unruffled and undamaged, not injured in the least.\u00a0The only thing that had changed was his sword; tiny drops of blood dripped from its edge and fell to the floor.The liquid was bright red and eye-catching.\u201cYou can\u2019t even block a single swing of my sword. Don\u2019t embarrass yourselves in front of me again.\u201d Su Yi shook his head.The guards\u2019 faces were pallid, their hearts full of terror.Their weapons had flown from their hands, and all of them were injured in the exact same place. They naturally understood that Su Yi had shown mercy upon them!\u00a0Had he wished to kill them, all of them would already be dead!The entire hall was in chaos. Everyone\u2019s expression shifted dramatically, and they started shouting:\u201cScoundrel! You dare use violence here?\u201d\u201cWhat gall! Su Yi, are you trying to overturn the heavens?\u201d\u201cAre you trying to force us to execute you!?\u201d Wen Changjing, Wen Changqing, and the other higher-ups were infuriated. They barely dared believe their eyes.None of them could have anticipated that a live-in son-in-law like Su Yi would dare fight back!Even\u00a0Wen\u00a0Jueyuan\u2019s jaw had dropped, and his mind went blank.He\u2019d always thought that Su Yi was just like him: young. They might be full of youthful vigor, but in the face of so many higher-ups\u2019 joint intimidation, they had no choice but to lower their heads.Who would have thought that a youth like Su Yi would dare commit assault in the middle of the Wen Family\u2019s great hall, in front of all the family higher-ups?Throughout all of Guangling City, which member of the younger generation would dare do such a thing?He was practically seeking death!\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t kill anyone just now, but if you keep refusing to\u00a0wisen\u00a0up, I wouldn\u2019t mind killing a few of you as a warning to the rest,\u201d said Su Yi flatly.Wen Changjing\u2019s face went ashen, and he shouted in fury, \u201cChangqing, seize him!\u201d\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Wen Changqing coldly. He strode right up to Su Yi.In an instant, all eyes were upon Wen Changqing.Wen Changqing\u2019s cultivation was on par with the family head\u2019s; both were in the middle stage of the Martial Dao\u2019s Qi Accumulation Realm, \u201cOpening Meridians.\u201dWhat did it mean to open the meridians?The body housed twelve meridians in total. Each one a martial artist opened meant an increase in power.As of today, Wen Changqing\u00a0had\u00a0fully opened eight of them!Among Guangling City\u2019s Qi Accumulation martial artists, he was a first-rate expert.Wen Changqing\u2019s eyes glinted, and his qi coursed around him like a river. His aura expanded, and his robes billowed in the resulting wind.This was the bearing of a Qi Accumulation expert. His aura was so oppressive, those present could barely breathe. All of them were visibly moved.\u201cSecond Uncle, whatever you do, don\u2019t go easy on that scoundrel!\u201d Wen Juejuan gnashed his teeth and shouted.Wen Changqing nodded, his gaze sharp as a hawk\u2019s. His lips parted, and he whispered a single sentence: \u201cKneel, or die!\u201dHis words weren\u2019t loud, yet went off like thunder, echoing throughout the hall and ringing in the onlookers\u2019 ears.His bearing was so imposing, he shook their very souls!But Su Yi remained as calm as ever. The only difference was that his eyes glinted with a hint of murderous intent.He said nothing.He just stepped forward, Mortal Edge in hand, and stabbed.He\u2019s throwing his life away!\u00a0Many of those present sneered derisively.\u00a0A Blood Circulation Realm kid like him dares attack a Qi Accumulation Expert? That\u2019s like an egg throwing itself against a rock. How is this any different from suicide?Wen Changqing snorted. His hands rose, then interlocked.The Divine Eagle Talons!This was the strongest technique currently in the Wen Family\u2019s possession, a mid-tier profound-grade martial art. Its users\u2019 palms and fingers were like blades; they could split swords, shatter boulders, and rip tigers and leopard limb from limb!If a wielder of the Divine Eagle Talons struck an ordinary martial artist, a light touch would tear flesh from the bone, while a stronger impact would rip their bodies right open. This art was vicious, sharp, and incomparably bloody.Clang!Claws clashed against\u00a0sword, scattering sparks.The talons firmly clamped the sword in place, like an eagle seizing a snake.When they saw this, those in attendance exclaimed in delight.A hint of a smirk tugged at\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changqing\u2019s lips.But an instant later, Mortal Edge suddenly hummed in excitement, then burst with limitlessly terrifying power, like waters breaking through a dam. It broke through Wen Changqing\u2019s grip effortlessly.The newly-freed sword struck like lightning, as easily as an ax through rotting wood.This is bad!\u00a0Wen Changqing\u2019s expression shifted dramatically. He tried to dodge, but he was one step too late. Mortal Edge had already pierced right through his chest, coming straight out the other side.He\u2019d been run through!The entire hall fell silent.They\u2019d only just been cheering Wen Changqing on, only to see this bloody scene play out before them. Despite themselves, they were tongue-tied. Their eyes widened, and they trembled.\u201cThis\u2026..\u201d It seemed Wen Changqing could barely believe it either. A Blood Circulation Realm Youth had run him through in just one attack!?Splurt!Su Yi pulled his sword back out, splattering drops of piping hot blood. Wen Changqing grunted, staggered, then collapsed onto the floor.The sword had penetrated him just two inches away from his heart. The wound was severe and so agonizing, his vision was starting to go dark. His face was pallid, and sweat poured from his forehead like a waterfall.\u201cKneel or die?\u201d A hint of a mocking smile tugged at Su Yi\u2019s lips. \u201cYour cultivation might be a mess, but you sure can talk.\u201dHis gaze swept across the room. \u201cDoes anyone else want to test if my sword\u2019s edge is sharp or not?\u201dEveryone\u2019s hair stood on end. They felt as if they\u2019d plunged into an icy abyss; none of them dared meet Su Yi\u2019s gaze.Wen Jueyuan was so scared, he shook from head to toe. He was practically on the verge of collapse.Su Yi had grievously injured an Opening\u00a0Meridians\u00a0Qi Accumulation Expert, one of the strongest fighters in the entire Wen Family, with just one swing of his sword!It was like a blood-soaked nightmare!But then, Family Head\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changjing suddenly inhaled, his face ashen, before shouting, \u201cSu Yi, do you really want to wage war against the entire Wen Family?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Just This Once, This Ends HereSu Yi glanced at Mortals Edge and said flatly, \u201cI disdained getting even with the Wen Family right from the start, yet you stubbornly refuse to back down. Even now, you dare ask such questions\u2026..\u201dHe looked up, a faint hint of a smile on his lips. \u201cIn that case, I don\u2019t mind killing my fill of everyone in the room.\u201dThe moment he said this, a terrifyingly sharp energy spread out around him. The air seemed to freeze. Bone-chillingly cold murderous intent swept across the hall.Everyone quivered, visibly shaken.What terrifying murderous intent!\u00a0Even Wen Changjing felt suffocated, and his heart surged with inexplicable terror. For a moment, he was so shaken, he dared not say a single word.Wen Changqing, who lay sprawled out before Su Yi, was the most affected. He felt as if tens of thousands of swords were pointed right at him, and so long as Su Yi willed it, he\u2019d perish on the spot!\u201cEnough!\u201d Suddenly, a harsh shout rang out from beyond the great hall.Su Yi turned to look, then saw the white-haired Wen Family matriarch standing there, her face ashen, clouded over and furious.And in her hand, she clenched a jade talisman.This talisman was called Star Cleaver, and it was a gift from Su Hongli of the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family. It could kill Martial Dao Grandmasters in a single hit!Su Yi naturally recognized it.The Wen Family matriarch had threatened him with it during their meeting in the Floral Tea House.\u201cOld woman, didn\u2019t you warn them not to provoke me after your birthday feast?\u201d asked Su Yi calmly.The Wen Family matriarch looked at the panicked, helpless\u00a0Wen\u00a0Family members, then at the impaled Wen Changqing sprawled out on the floor. Uncontrollable grief and indignation rose on her face.She took a deep breath, then fixed her gaze back on Su Yi. \u201cMight you give this old lady face and let this matter end here?\u201dSu Yi thought about it and said, \u201cJust this once.\u201dAlthough he\u2019d endured a lot of jeers and mockery in the year following his marriage into the Wen Family, no one had ever really hurt or physically bullied him.\u00a0This certainly wasn\u2019t because everyone in the family was kind-hearted. It was because those were the matriarch\u2019s orders.Today, the elderly matriarch, someone long accustomed to power, had lowered her head. He\u2019d let this go on her account; he at least owed her that much.When they heard Su Yi\u2019s response, the gathered Wen Family higher-ups inwardly heaved sighs of relief; they\u2019d sensed that they\u2019d just narrowly avoided calamity.The matriarch\u2019s dark expression warmed somewhat. \u201cI\u2019ll remember this favor.\u201dSu Yi sheathed his blade, then turned and walked outside. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to spare the others so much as a second glance.But as he passed the matriarch, he paused and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving Guangling City shortly. Going forward, I won\u2019t interfere in the Wen Family\u2019s affairs any further.\u00a0Of course, if you\u2019re displeased, you\u2019re welcome to write a letter to the Jade Capital and request that the Su Family deal with me.\u201d With that, he turned and left.His silhouette slowly faded into the distance. No one dared attempt to stop him.The Wen Family matriarch\u2019s expression shifted back and forth. Finally, she sighed and put away the jade talisman she had clenched tightly in her fist.Then she turned and entered the great hall.The floor was covered in rubble, and the pools of blood were jarring and unmistakable. She then examined everyone\u2019s uneasy, fearful expressions. An inexplicable emotion coursed through her.As big as the Wen Family was, they didn\u2019t have a single man capable of turning the tides today!\u201cThe injured should leave for treatment right away. Everyone else, stay behind.\u201d The matriarch repressed her grief and fury, then calmly gave her orders.Before long, Wen Changqing and the injured guards were carried off for treatment.Meanwhile, Wen Changjing told the matriarch everything that had happened, from beginning to end. He dared not hold back the slightest detail.When she heard the full story, the matriarch was so angry that she quivered with rage. She stormed forward and slapped Wen Changjing right across the face, hard.Whap!This resounding slap left\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changjing a bit bewildered.The others in the hall were stunned senseless.\u00a0What\u2019s up with the old lady?The matriarch was practically burning up with rage. She shouted, \u201cWhen Su Yi married into the Wen Family, did I not tell you to leave him to his own devices? That no one was to get involved in his affairs, regardless of his life or death?\u201dWen Changjing said nothing; he naturally remembered her saying just that.\u201cIf he were an ordinary live-in son-in-law, you could kill him as you pleased. But you\u2019re the family head. Don\u2019t tell me you still haven\u2019t realized even after all this time that Su Yi is no ordinary person?\u201d She looked at\u00a0Wen\u00a0Changjing in disappointment, then furiously rebuked him. \u201cTell me, \u2018esteemed head of the Wen Family\u2019: is the champion of the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, a youth both Fu Shan and Huang Yunchong think highly of, only worthy of becoming your son\u2019s underling?\u201dWen Changjing\u2019s expression was unsightly.\u00a0Wen Jueyuan stood nearby, and he felt utterly ill at ease; he even felt the urge to crawl into a hole and hide.\u201cMatriarch, I just thought that giving Su Yi too much power would invite disaster, but that you wouldn\u2019t agree to simply kick him out. That\u2019s why I proposed those conditions,\u201d said Wen Changjing solemnly, attempting to explain himself. \u201cFurthermore, I already made it clear that if he needed better conditions, he could go ahead and ask for them. I figured he was just a seventeen-year-old, and our live-in son-in-law at that, so I thought my offer was generous enough to get him to work for us. Who would have thought that he\u2019d\u2026.\u201dHis voice trailed off, and regret coursed through his heart.\u00a0If he\u2019d known just how powerful Su Yi\u2019s Martial Dao was, how could he possibly have been so stupid?The matriarch let out a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m to blame as well. I\u2019ve been under orders this entire time, so I couldn\u2019t tell you the truth about Su Yi\u2019s origins. Otherwise, this never would have happened\u2026.\u201dHer tone revealed both bitterness and self-recrimination.\u201cMatriarch, are you saying there\u2019s something unusual about Su Yi\u2019s background?\u201d Wen Jueyuan couldn\u2019t help but ask.The others all turned to look at her. The matriarch then said with an air of self-mockery, \u201cDo you really think that I\u2019d simply hardened my heart to force Lingzhao to marry the cast-off disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor just because? I had no choice either\u2026.\u201dEveryone was stunned.\u00a0So, the matriarch had no choice but to accept this arrangement either. There really was something fishy about this wedding arrangement!Wen Changjing suddenly recalled something; it was as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMatriarch, don\u2019t tell Su Yi has something to do with the Jade Capital\u2019s Su\u2026.\u201d\u201cSilence!\u201d The matriarch immediately cut him off, but his words were still enough to get the others pondering. Wen Jueyuan aside, all of their expressions filled with surprise.All of them were well aware that years ago, when the matriarch was still young, she worked in the Jade Capital as the Su Family Head\u2019s personal servant!The Su Family! That was one of the top clans in the Jade Capital!By comparison, the Wen Family was like an ant; they could only gaze upon the Su Family from afar!But Su Yi was surnamed \u201cSu\u201d too\u2026.Who wouldn\u2019t have been shocked after putting the pieces together?When the Wen Family matriarch saw this, she sighed inwardly, but on the outside, she was unusually solemn and grave. \u201cNot one word of this is to leave the hall. Otherwise, it\u2019ll bring annihilation upon the entire Wen Family. That\u2019s no empty threat, either!\u201dEveryone\u2019s hearts shook, and chills coursed down their spines.With the power available to the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family, they wouldn\u2019t even need to take action themselves. All they had to do was say the word, and countless people would charge forth to annihilate the Wen Family on their behalf!\u201cIf I\u2019d known there was something fishy about Su Yi\u2019s background, I\u2026 I would never have\u2026.\u201d It was as if Wen Changjing had lost his soul; he completely lost control of his emotions.\u201cNo, you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d The matriarch\u2019s expression turned indifferent. \u201cSu Yi is Su Yi. He doesn\u2019t represent anybody except himself. He\u2019s just the unworthy child of a concubine. The more he jumps around, the closer he is to death.\"The crowd\u2019s minds went blank.\u00a0Su Yi? An unworthy descendent?That was certainly food for thought.\u201cToday\u2019s incident ends here. Su Yi won\u2019t remain in Guangling City any longer. That\u2019s excellent news for the Wen Family.\u201dThe matriarch rose and exited the hall. \u201cRemember what I said today. You are not to get involved with that boy in any way. He\u2019s a walking disaster, both to himself and to others!\u2019Wen Changqing suddenly recalled something, and he hurriedly asked, \u201cMatriarch, what about Lingzhao? That girl wants nothing more than to annul this marriage. If she offends Su Yi, won\u2019t that lead to trouble?\u201dThe matriarch instantly froze midstep, her expression alternating back and forth.Wen Lingzhao was a disciple of Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, the live-in disciple of the Martial Dao Grandmaster, Zhu Guqing. She represented the Wen Family\u2019s hope for a brighter future.She couldn\u2019t let a good seedling like Lingzhao fall to ruin.\u201cI\u2019ll personally write Lingzhao a letter and tell her what to do,\u201d said the matriarch. With that, she turned to leave.They sealed all word of what had happened in the clan hall today. No one was to spread news of this incident.Fortunately, this incident\u00a0had\u00a0occurred within the clan hall, and there\u2019d been no random bystanders present.Otherwise, they could never have kept this under wraps.But even so, Wen Changjing and the other higher-ups knew that they could hide this for a while, but not for a lifetime.Still, this was all they could do now.\u2026\u2026Late at night.The Apricot Cottage.Su Yi stood, hands behind his back, before the courtyard\u2019s old locust tree. He narrowed his eyes and peered through the branches and up at the sky, perfectly relaxed.\u201cGuangling City is barely the size of my palm. There\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d After a while, Su Yi looked away, went to his room, and started packing his things.He\u2019d originally planned to wait for Wen Lingxue\u2019s return and spend some time with her before he left.But she\u2019d stayed behind, and was currently cultivating at Blueriver Sword Manor. There was nothing else keeping Su Yi here, so he decided to leave for the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital at dawn!The skies gradually darkened.Once Su Yi had everything in order, he lazed in the courtyard\u2019s bamboo chair and admired the light of dusk over the horizon.Inwardly, he was pondering various matters. Most were related to the next steps of his cultivation, but some were memories of his time in the prefectural capital.He\u2019d spent three years cultivating in Blueriver Sword Manor, and he\u2019d been to the prefectural capital many times.It was just that most of his memories of those three years were tinged with grey; there was grief, regret, depression\u2026When he first entered Blueriver Sword Manor, he was just thirteen, and he was all on his own.Due to his aloof nature and inability to get along with others, because he didn\u2019t know how to ingratiate himself to his elders, and because of his stubborn refusal to lower his head to wealthy and influential sectmates, he\u2019d suffered an unknowable amount of bullying, attacks, insults, and rejection\u2026But none of this knocked him down. On the contrary, it only fanned the flames of his hatred, motivating him to cultivate harder and pursue strength with everything he had.During those three years, he\u2019d advanced step by step, becoming the Sword Chief of the outer sect!But then\u2026.Before he could avenge his three years of accumulated hatred, an accident robbed him of his cultivation.As a result, he\u2019d yet to resolve the resentment he\u2019d accumulated during those three years or the grudges and hatred he\u2019d buried deep within his heart. They haunted him even now.My past self could only suffer in silence. Although he was pitiable, he had an iron will. He never once lowered his head to fate\u2026\u00a0Su Yi leaned into his bamboo chair and let out a breath of turbid air. Those distant, profound eyes gradually lit up with sharpness and fire.This time, when I return to the prefectural capital, I\u2019ll be sure to resolve everything that happened then, one by one. I\u2019ll cleanse my heart of all its grievances!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Roast Chicken and Pear Blossom BrewThe night was cool and tranquil. Moonlight bathed the world below.The occasional burst of uproar emanated from the distant alleyways, but this only further offset the peace and quiet of the courtyard.Just as Su Yi\u2019s thoughts raced, someone knocked at his gate.\u201cYoung Lord Su, are you home?\u201d Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s voice sounded from just outside the courtyard.Su Yi rose, opened the doors, and saw Zhang Yuanxing standing there with a pot of wine and a roast chicken.\u00a0The ever-present, black-hatted Uncle Xiong was with him as usual.\u201cMight I ask why you\u2019re here?\u201d asked Su Yi.\u201cDoesn\u2019t sharing a drink and conversation on a beautiful night like this sound grand?\u201d As he said this, Zhang Yuanxing strolled right into the courtyard, a broad grin on his face. He looked around, then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit crude, but it's nice and quiet.\u201dZhang Yuanxing set the wine and chicken on the stone table beneath the old locust tree, then sat on one of the stone benches and smiled. \u201cPlease take a seat, Young Lord Su.\u201dHe really made himself right at home, huh?\u00a0Su Yi didn\u2019t call him out on it, though. He took two wine glasses and sat across from Zhang Yuanxing.\u201cI brought this wine from home. It\u2019s called \u2018Pear Blossom Brew\u2019, and it\u2019s made from the first pear blossoms of spring steeped in spiritual spring water. Thirty-six varieties of spiritual medicine are infused into the liquid, which is then sealed and aged in clay vats for nine years. Even back at home, we only bring this out to entertain our most distinguished guests.\u201dAs he said this, Zhang Yuanxing opened the wine, and a clear fragrance immediately permeated the night sky.\u00a0When Zhang Yuanxing poured the wine into the two cups, the liquid was crystal-clear and a faint, translucent amber. It reflected the moon and emanated a hint of spiritual light.\u201cCheers.\u201d Zhang Yuanxing smiled and toasted Su Yi, a boastful smile on his face.\u00a0He trusted that with Su Yi\u2019s keen powers of observation, he\u2019d be able to sense how exceptional this Pear Blossom Brew was.But against all expectations, Su Yi remained quite calm. \u201cYoung Master Zhang, I\u2019m afraid you aren\u2019t just here for a drinking partner. Why not tell me what you\u2019re really here for? There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t drink after we finish our business.\u201dThis Pear Blossom Brew really was an excellent wine, but that was by the standards of the mundane world.Alas, it was light years away from the immortal brews and exquisite ambrosias Su Yi had savored in his past life. How could something like this move him?Zhang Yuanxing might seem personable, but in truth, he was blatantly showing off.The funny part was, he didn\u2019t even realize it. Zhang Yuanxing froze, then set down his glass. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing major. I just wanted to ask about what happened in Mother Ghost Ridge.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you learn all that a long time ago?\u201d asked Su Yi.Zhang Yuanxing said directly, \u201cNo, I want to ask what specifically you helped Yuan Luoxi and Cheng Wuyong with to make them treat you with such respect.\u201dBoth he and Uncle Xiong looked over. Although their expressions were calm, their combined gazes were enough to put an enormous amount of pressure on someone.Su Yi could vaguely sense the true purpose of\u00a0Zhang\u00a0Yuanxing\u2019s visit. \u201cWhy not just ask them?\u201dZhang Yuanxing furrowed his brow. He felt a bit impatient, but he nonetheless explained, \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019d share that information with me. If it were that simple, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to come here and disturb you in the first place.\u201dSu Yi said lightly, \u201cThe answer\u2019s actually quite simple. In Mother Ghost Ridge, I saved their lives, and I sold them a stalk of Six Yin Grass. I expect that\u2019s why they\u2019re treating me with such respect.\u201dHe didn\u2019t hide anything. He disdained lying about something so trivial.There was no need, either.But Zhang Yuanxing merely froze, stunned, and furrowed his brow. \u201cYoung Lord Su, that joke isn\u2019t the least bit funny.\u201dHe obviously didn\u2019t buy it.With a peak Qi Accumulation expert like Cheng Wuyong at her side, how could Yuan Luoxi possibly need a Blood Circulation Realm youth to save her life?The very concept was ludicrous.The nearby Elder Xiong suddenly asked, \u201cMight you explain in more detail just how you saved them?\u201dZhang Yuanxing was a bit stunned. He looked at Su Yi, half-convinced, but still doubtful. He too wanted to hear a more detailed explanation.Su Yi said casually, \u201cLast night, a\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse took advantage of the rain to ambush our party. Cheng Wuyong alone wasn\u2019t any match for it, but by perfect coincidence, I went to Mother Ghost Ridge specifically in pursuit of that very creature. I killed it, so you could say I inadvertently saved their lives in the process.\u201dZhang Yuanxing\u2019s expression gradually darkened. He forced back his rage and said, \u201cSu Yi, I treated you like a friend, someone I could really talk to, yet you\u2019re trying to deceive me with such blatantly obvious nonsense? Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re looking down on me a bit too much?\u201dAs he spoke this final sentence, he looked and sounded stern.Seeing Su Yi and Yuan Luoxi together outside the city had already left him quite displeased. He thought that Su Yi had failed to appreciate his kindness, that he\u2019d admired Su Yi in vain.Then there was their banquet in the Immortal Gathering House. Just thinking about the awed, respectful way Yuan Luoxi treated Su Yi soured Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s mood.That was why, by the time he paid Su Yi a visit tonight, rage had already accumulated in his heart. He\u2019d thought that so long as Su Yi obediently cooperated with him, he wouldn\u2019t mind showing some magnanimity and letting off just this once.Who would have thought that Su Yi would stubbornly persist in telling blatant lies full of holes? Su Yi was insulting his intelligence!The nearby Uncle Xiong furrowed his brow as well. \u201cSu Yi, if you\u2019re saying this to show off before our young master, all I can say is, you\u2019re acting like a child. Ridiculous!His voice carried a chill.It was obvious that neither of them believed that Su Yi could use his Blood Circulation Realm cultivation to kill a\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse, a foe even Martial Dao Grandmasters would struggle to overcome.Su Yi was like an ant bragging about biting a tiger to death: ridiculous and absurd to the extreme.Su Yi sighed.\u00a0He was telling the truth, but no one believed him. This was really exasperating. \u201cI already said everything I have to say. If you don\u2019t believe me, you\u2019re welcome to ask Yuan Luoxi and her companions. I\u2019m in no mood to explain myself any further.\u201dWith that, he turned and entered his room. \u201cHave a good journey home. Forgive me for not seeing you off.\u201dHe was effectively giving them an eviction order.Whap!Zhang Yuanxing picked up his wine glass and flung it against the ground, shattering it. \u201cSu Yi, you\u2019ve refused my good intentions. You\u2019re forcing my hand!\u201dSu Yi suddenly turned around, his gaze increasingly cold. \u201cWhat? Young Master Zhang, do you plan to cause a disturbance at my residence?\u201d\u201cA disturbance?\u201d Zhang Yuanxing was so angry, he laughed, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to concern himself about his bearing any longer. \u201cI was polite to you earlier because I admired your performance at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, but you\u2019ve repeatedly pushed your luck. Do you really think I\u2019m so easy-going that I\u2019ll just let this slide?\u201dHis expression frosted over, and he pointed at Su Yi. \u201cListen up! If you don\u2019t give it to me straight, don\u2019t blame me for my poor manners!\u201dThe nearby Uncle Xiong said indifferently, \u201cYoung Master, please remain calm. Su Yi says he\u2019s capable of killing a\u00a0Six-Severings\u00a0Yin\u00a0Corpse, so why not let me test him? We\u2019ll see for ourselves if he was lying or if he\u2019s really as skilled as he says.\u201dZhang Yuanxing took a deep breath, then nodded. \u201cThat works too, but Uncle Xiong, whatever you do, you mustn\u2019t kill him. I still want to ask him about Mother Ghost Ridge. If I don\u2019t learn the truth, it\u2019ll gnaw away at my heart.\u201dUncle Xiong nodded. \u201cYoung man, too much is just as bad as too little. It\u2019s not too late for you to mend your ways and tell the truth.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s lips angled upward. In the end, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, as if he were looking at a pair of buffoons. \u201cYou\u2019re well aware that Yuan Luoxi and Cheng Wuyong respect me, yet you dare act so brazenly in front of me? Should I call you stupid? Or just reckless?\u201dZhang Yuanxing froze. From the look of him, he didn\u2019t dare believe that even at a time like this, Su Yi would speak with so few reservations.Uncle Xiong\u2019s expression darkened, his gaze suddenly murderous.\u00a0Even he was stunned; he would never have imagined that a paltry little Blood Circulation Realm cultivator like Su Yi would treat him with such disrespect!He hesitated no further. He stepped towards Su Yi, his stride as powerful as a tiger or dragon, his aura billowing around him.Bang!The courtyard gates suddenly swung open.A graceful figure charged over and roared, \u201cZhang Yuanxing, try it if you dare!\u201dShe wore military attire, with long, slender legs. Beneath the moonlight, her pretty face blazed with unconcealed rage.This was none other than Yuan Luoxi.Three people\u00a0trailed\u00a0after her: Cheng Wuyong, Fu Shan, and Nie Beihu.Their expressions weren\u2019t the least bit pleasant either.Su Yi was briefly stunned.\u00a0What are they doing here?Zhang Yuanxing had obviously been caught off guard too. He froze, then asked, \u201cLuoxi, didn\u2019t you depart the city this morning?\u201dUncle Xiong frowned, then stopped in his tracks, forcibly suppressing his killing intent.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come, how could I have witnessed your \u2018awe-inspiring might\u2019?\u201d Yuan Luoxi\u2019s beautiful eyes flashing with intimidating fury.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the distinguished son of the Zhang Family Head would be so short-sighted,\u201d Fu Shan snorted coldly.When Yuan Luoxi flung blatant insults at him, Zhang Yuanxing could endure.\u00a0But when he saw that even Fu Shan dared mock him, he instantly lost his temper. \u201cFu Shan, who gave you the gall? How dare you talk to me like that?\u201d\u201cI am the lord of Guangling City, and you\u2019re attacking someone in my territory. Am I not entitled to say a few words? Do you really think this is your home turf?\u201d asked Fu Shan, his expression imposing.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Zhang Yuanxing was just about to say something when Uncle Xiong pulled him back.\u201cYoung Master, we ought to leave,\u201d said Uncle Xiong gruffly.He could tell at a glance that with Yuan Luoxi present, if they really dared touch Su Yi, Cheng Wuyong, Fu Shan, and the others would stop them without hesitation.Cheng Wuyong was enough to restrict their movements. With two more Qi Accumulation experts like Fu Shan and Nie Beihu in the mix, the results were sure not to be in their favor.But Zhang Yuanxing wasn\u2019t willing to just leave like this\u2026.He took several breaths, suppressed his irritation, and said sincerely, \u201cLuoxi, it\u2019s really not what you think\u2026.Yuan Luoxi cut him off, not the least bit polite. \u201cScram! Who wants to hear your explanations? If you don\u2019t get out of here right this second, don\u2019t blame me for losing my temper! When that happens, I\u2019ll be interested to see whether or not your daddy comes running to help you get even!\u201dThese words were more than a little rude; she was blatantly trampling all over Zhang Yuanxing\u2019s dignity.His expression went red, and the veins\u00a0bulged\u00a0in his forehead. He was on the verge of losing it.He wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Yuan Luoxi would throw all caution to the wind and oppose him directly over the Wen\u00a0Family\u2019s\u00a0live-in son-in-law!\u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t forget the bigger picture. This is but a moment\u2019s shame; you\u2019ll naturally make this right one day!\"\u00a0As he spoke, Uncle Xiong grabbed Zhang Yuanxing by the shoulder and dragged him off. They soon disappeared from view.The moonlight flowed like water through the misty night skies.The roast chicken on the stone table was left uneaten, the Pear Blossom Brew undrunk. The hostile stand-off vanished into nothingness, just like that.But Su Yi\u2019s brow furrowed slightly.Yuan Luoxi and company arrived right in the nick of time\u2026. They\u2019d essentially just saved Zhang Yuanxing and his Uncle Xiong\u2019s lives\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Universal Self-Embodiment SutraOnce Zhang Yuanxing and Uncle Xong faded from view, Yuan Luoxi\u2019s anger dissipated.She gently pursed her pink lips, a hint of trepidation on her brow as she lowered her head, not daring to meet Su Yi\u2019s gaze. \u201cMystic Master, you\u2026 You\u2019re not angry, are you?\u201dCheng Wuyong hurriedly cupped his fist and said apologetically, \u201cMystic Master, we\u2019re well aware that with the methods at your disposal, you could have killed them both. It\u2019s just, we thought that since this incident arose because of us, we ought to resolve it ourselves. This would prevent you from being implicated any further.\u201dYuan Luoxi hurriedly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly it.\u201dSeeing this, waves coursed through Fu Shan\u2019s heart once more.When she faced Zhang Yuanxing, Yuan Luoxi was\u00a0aggressive\u00a0and unreasonable, not the least bit concerned that this might offend the prefectural capital\u2019s Zhang Family. But when she faced Su Yi, the pearl of the Yuan Family was as nervous as a child who\u2019d made a mistake.Then there was Cheng Wuyong, a peak Qi Accumulation expert. He was nearly a peak expert even by the standards of the prefectural capital, but he was every bit as scrupulously polite as Yuan Luoxi.The difference in attitude was enormous!Fu Shan pondered briefly, then bowed in solemn greeting. \u201cMaster Su, it was I who brought them here, inadvertently arriving just in time to witness this incident. If you\u2019re displeased, I will accept full responsibility.\u201dSeeing this, Su Yi\u2019s lingering displeasure faded. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to pursue the matter any further, so he waved away their concerns. \u201cThis matter ends here.\u201dYuan Luoxi, Cheng Wuyong, and Fu Shan all inwardly sighed in relief.The more they understood Su Yi\u2019s unbelievable abilities, the more awed they felt.Facing him wasn\u2019t like facing an ordinary youth. It was more like facing a proud immortal who\u2019d descended from the clouds.His heart was like the ocean; they couldn\u2019t fathom its depths!\u201cSo, to what do I\u00a0owe tonight\u2019s\u00a0visit?\u201d asked Su Yi offhandedly. He clearly recalled Yuan Luoxi saying she planned to leave this morning, yet here she was, standing here now.Yuan Luoxi responded in a crisp clear voice, \u201cI heard City Lord Fu say that you were planning to leave Guangling City and go to the prefectural capital in the near future, so I decided to visit and ask when you planned to depart. If we could go together, that\u2026 that would be even better.\u201dHer words carried a hint of anticipation.Fu Shan hurriedly added, \u201cMaster Su, there\u2019s something you should know. I just received word that tomorrow at noon, a massive tower ship from \u2018the Roving City of Commerce\u2019 that floats atop the Great Azure will be passing through Guangling City. It will dock here briefly.\u201cIf you take this boat to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, you\u2019ll arrive in just three days. Furthermore, the cabins are extremely comfortable. The tower has nine floors, with twelve pagodas built on its roof. It can house up to eight thousand passengers. It\u2019s a top class treasure ship of the Great Zhou.Fu Shan paused, then continued, \u201cIf you travel by horseback, in addition to the hardships of the road, the journey is long. You\u2019ll need to pass through numerous cities and mountains. It\u2019ll take at least five days to reach the prefectural capital. Thus, I thought that if you\u2019re set on leaving, you might as well travel by boat.\u201dSu Yi was surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s very thoughtful of you.\u201dHe was surprised that Fu Shan would consider his needs so thoroughly.\u201cMystic Master\u2026.\u201d Yuan Luoxi was about to say something, but Su Yi cut her off.\u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary sword cultivator of the mundane world. I\u2019m no \u2018Mystic Master.\u2019 Going forward, just call me by name. \u2018Young Lord\u2019 is fine too.\u201d\u201cUh, then may I call you \u2018Master Su\u2019 like City Lord Fu Shan does?\u201d Yuan Luoxi said hesitantly.\u201cMaster\u201d had a special meaning to martial artists. It included the character for \u201cfirst\u201d, and thus meant \u201cone who knows more\u201d. It wasn\u2019t just a respectful title; it was an honorific.\u201cYou may,\u201d said Su Yi. Why would he care about something like that?The only reason he didn\u2019t want to be called \u201cMystic Master\u201d was that in this mundane world, most of those who called themselves \u201cmystic masters\u201d were scammers and swindlers.\u201cMystic Master\u201d was a popular title among wandering Daoists, vagrant warriors, traveling snake-oil salesmen, and adherents of unorthodox offshoots of cultivation.Su Yi didn\u2019t want to be mistaken for a third-rate character like that.When Qing Wan called him that, he didn\u2019t mind. After all, she was a ghost, not a human.But Yuan Luoxi was different. She and her companions were ultimately just martial artists of the mundane world. If they called him \u201cMystic Master\u201d and others overheard, it would be hard to avoid unfortunate misunderstandings.\u201cMaster Su, might I ask if you\u2019ll be boarding the ship tomorrow?\u201d asked Yuan Luoxi gently, but her tone was hopeful.\u201cThinking about it, this really does work out perfectly. I was planning to leave Guangling City tomorrow anyway. In that case, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t travel together.\u201d Su Yi smiled and nodded.\u201cWonderful!\u201d A radiant smile blossomed across Yuan Luoxi\u2019s face. She was beside herself with excitement.Only at times like this did she have the pretty, graceful air of a young woman.\u201cCity Lord Fu Shan and I have already arranged rooms on board,\u201d said Cheng Wuyong with a smile.The way he saw it, traveling with Su Yi meant more chances to interact with him and tighten their bond.Fu Shan smiled as he watched this play out.\u00a0I\u2019m glad I came tonight. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid I would have missed Master Su\u2019s departure.Before long, Yuan Luoxi and the others bade farewell.Su Yi then strolled up to the old locust tree, carrying the pot of Peach Blossom Brew Zhang Yuanxing had left on the stone table. He casually poured its contents into the dirt. \u201cI might not treasure it, but it\u2019s still a decent spiritual brew. You\u2019ve\u00a0sure\u00a0profited this time.\u201dOnce the pot was empty, Su Yi glanced up at the flourishing old tree and muttered to himself, \u201cIf I ever come back, and if you\u2019re still here, it\u2019ll mean we\u2019re connected by fate, and I\u2019ll grant you a stroke of fortune.\u201dHe then laughed and returned to his room.The night was dark and tranquil, and the branches of the old locust tree rustled in the wind, scattering flecks of moonlight,Candles still lit Su Yi\u2019s room.He was seated at his desk and lost in thought. He unfurled a roll of paper and, in a few brush strokes, wrote a line of text. He then bound the paper in wire and placed it into his ink jade pendant.With my current cultivation, I should be able to start tempering my soul.\u00a0Su Yi rubbed his forehead and sank into thought.Cultivation base, soul, and physique. The three supported, formed, and complemented each other.Cultivating the qi tempered the body, and a strong body nourished the soul.Thus, in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, anyone with the ambition to reach the pinnacle, the Imperial Realm, would start cultivating their souls alongside their bodies right from the early stages of their journey.A powerful soul had numerous advantages. It could increase your ability to comprehend the Grand Dao of Heaven and Earth, and it made it easier to fathom the profundities of mysterious inheritances and secret tomes.Of course, most important of all, it was also useful in battle!Cultivating the soul was an exacting process because any injury to the soul was a severe setback; it damaged your Dao.In the peak factions of the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, it was only after disciples cultivated their bodies to the \u201cInner Furnace Realm\u201d, passed a stringent selection process, and met strict requirements that their seniors would impart soul tempering techniques to them, one-on-one.In his past life, Su Yi had done the same thing when he taught his nine inheriting disciples.This was because the soul was a person\u2019s root, the core of their personality. Especially in the early stages of cultivation, there was no room for even the slightest error.But to Su Yi, none of that posed a problem.In this life, he\u2019d used the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique to cultivate the Martial Dao anew. At step along of the Blood Circulation Realm, he\u2019d forged foundations far sturdier than his past self.It was no exaggeration to say that should he return to the Nine Provinces, his Martial Dao foundations would surpass all peerless monsters and unparalleled immortal beauties beneath the heavens!This was why Su Yi planned to begin his soul cultivation earlier than most.This wasn\u2019t recklessness; his decision came from his understanding of his current foundations.The reason I got stuck at the peak of the Profound Unity Realm in my past life, the reason I couldn\u2019t so much as brush against higher levels of the Dao, was partially because I wasn\u2019t fated for it; there was no turning point of fate or stroke of fortune for me to seize. But it was also partially because the foundations of my soul cultivation were insufficiently powerful.Su Yi began sifting through and summarizing the experiences of harsh lessons of his past life.At the end of the day, it\u2019s because when I began cultivating my soul, I lacked an exquisite, peerless soul cultivation method. As a result, the foundations I established in my youth were far too ordinary.Even though in the tens of thousands of years that followed, I sought out every secret technique, treasure, and divine medicine capable of nourishing and enhancing the soul, it was hard to fix the fundamental inadequacies of my foundations\u2026Now that I\u2019ve reincarnated, I cannot allow my earlier mistakes to play out once more!Su Yi\u2019s gaze was calm, but his eyes contained an ancient, unshakeable resolve.It was only after suffering the consequences that he realized just how important the early stages of cultivation were. There was no room for even the slightest negligence!He needed to use steadfast determination, boldness, and breadth of spirit to polish his soul. No matter what, he couldn\u2019t rush this process.Of the secret techniques at my disposal, countless involve the soul in some way. Each has their own distinctive attributes and profundities, but only a select few can truly be said to stand above all others.In this life, I must cultivate a perfect, flawless soul. I don\u2019t just have to be stronger than I was at the same stage in my past life; I have to be stronger than everyone at my cultivation level. In that case, I have to choose my soul cultivation technique with the utmost care.As Su Yi pondered, three different secret soul cultivation techniques floated up into his mental sea.The Amitabha\u2019s Heaven Reflecting Sutra is the highest inheritance of the top Buddhist cultivation holy land of the Nine Provinces, \u2018the Little Western Paradise.\u2019 With it, I can cultivate twenty-four lotus platforms within my soul. When they bloom, their light will illuminate the heavens.Unfortunately, this particular sutra requires secret Buddhist techniques as supplements. You have to be fearless and indomitable, remaining still and seated even while undergoing the six purgatories. You must undergo life and death meditation for eight thousand years to forge a full set of perfect soul lotus platforms. Only then can your soul be as a lotus, blooming with light that illuminates the marvelous truths of the heavens.It was fair to call this the ultimate Buddhist soul cultivation technique, but after pondering for a while, Su Yi gave up on it.The Grotto of Profound Light Mental Courtyard Sutra? It\u2019s one of the Four Great Daoist Canons. If cultivated to the Imperial Realm, the soul will be like a separate world. This sutra opens the Mental Courtyard and unlocks the profound light hidden within. It\u2019s as if the user has infinite Mental Courtyards. They can live forever, unwithering, and manifest as any of the three thousand Spiritual Gods of Profound Light\u2026.Su Yi pondered in silence for a long time. In the end, he sighed, then gave up on this peerless technique of the Daoist way.This was for no other reason than that this secret art was particularly stringent in its requirements. From day one, users had to cultivate another peerless Daoist inheritance alongside it, \u201cthe Supreme Clarity Vital Energy Sutra.\u201dBut Su Yi had peerless secret cultivation methods of his own that he wanted to use. There was no way he\u2019d start over as a Daoist.Don\u2019t tell me I really have to cultivate the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra?\u00a0Su Yi hesitated for a while.This soul cultivation technique was something he\u2019d obtained in his past life, the result of a thread of enlightenment he\u2019d gleaned from the ninth of the Divine Chains sealing the Sword of the Nine Hells!Afterward, he used his own intelligence to further grasp its profundities. This, combined with the original thread of enlightenment, combined to form this secret soul cultivation method.In other words, this technique was the combination of 108,000 years of cultivation experience, 108,000 years of accumulated wisdom, and the power of enlightenment originating from the Divine Chains sealing the Sword of the Nine Hells.Seth's ThoughtsThe name of the technique here was a bit hard to translate\u2026If you\u2019ve read Perfect World, the Chinese is almost the same as in Shi Hao\u2019s\u00a0Embodiment Transformation Method. The only difference is that Su Yi calls this a \"sutra\", not a \u201cmethod\u201d.Even though the characters are the same, the technique itself seems pretty different. Shi Hao\u2019s is a clone technique. (Here\u2019s a quote for those who haven\u2019t read it/need a refresher: \u201cOne that can change the body of another, borrow the dao fruit of another, create a present embodiment! It is heaven-defying, a great method in the Age of Emperor Collapse!\u201d)But Su Yi\u2019s method is more like\u2026 transforming the \u201cother\u201d and making it into your own power or absorbing energy from all available sources and putting it to use. No cloning involved.The original source of the name appears to be Buddhism. While I can\u2019t say for sure if the authors of the two novels got it from other novels or directly from religious texts, I can say with certainty that neither novel is the original source.When I googled it, I got a bunch of Japanese results for \u4ed6\u5316\u81ea\u5728\u5929, Takejizai-ten, the \u201cHeaven of Freely Enjoying Things Conjured by Others\u201d, also translated as \u201cThe Heaven of Controlling Others\u2019 Emanations.\u201d I saw Chinese, Japanese, and even Sanskrit\u2026.It\u2019s the\u00a0sixth of the heaven of the desire realm, apparently? I\u2019m not entirely sure what that means. For our intents and purposes, it means \u201cputting almost literally anything to use\u201d.-\u201cMental courtyard\u201d, otherwise known as \u201cmind courtyard\u201d or \u201cgoverning vessel\u201d, is an accupoint located in the center of the forehead, right by the hairline. The term comes from Chinese Traditional Medicine.-I think I\u2019ve mentioned this before, but the choice to translate titles comes at a cost. English doesn\u2019t have direct equivalents for many Chinese titles, so I do the best I can. Some detail is lost, but I still prefer that to having a million \u201cguye\u2019s\u201d and \u201cshibo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdaren\u2019s\u201d in the translated text.Anyway, the term I\u2019ve been translating as \u201cmaster\u201d is a standard form of address for a man in normal conversations\u2026.\u00a0More like \"mister\" or \"sir\".However, it\u2019s written with the same characters for \u201csensei\u201d in Japanese, and does occasionally have the meaning of \u201cteacher\u201d or \u201cmaster\u201d in Chinese too, especially in older texts. So this chapter is saying that this normally polite (but otherwise unremarkable title) means something closer to \u201csensei\u201d when used by martial artists.I had to just pick /something/ so I went with \"master\", which seems closest to the intended meaning, but it's a bit of an unfortunate compromise, especially since there are so many other terms that include the word \"master\" in English translation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Ten Streams of Qi from the Sword of the Nine HellsIn his past life, Su Yi never managed to unlock the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2019 nine seals.His only gain was made shortly before reincarnating. He obtained a single burst of enlightenment power from the Sword of the Nine Hells, with which he created the soul cultivation technique he called the \u201cUniversal Self-Embodiment Sutra\u201d.He was certain that the subtle profundities of the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra were in no way inferior to the loftiest sutras of the Buddhist and Daoist paths, the Amitabha\u2019s Heaven-Reflecting Sutra and the Grotto of Profound Light Mental Courtyard Sutra!It might even surpass them!This was the confidence of the Swordmaster of Abstruse Force!After 108,000 years of experience, this was his judgment as the sole sovereign of the Wilds!But what made Su Yi hesitate was that the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra was incomplete. He could only cultivate it until the Profound Dao\u2019s \u201cImperial\u201d Realm.The Profound Dao was divided into three great realms: Profound Illumination, Profound Serenity, and Profound Unity.Even with all the methods at his past life\u2019s disposal, he\u2019d only managed to derive and formulate the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra until the Profound Illumination Realm.It wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t intelligent enough to go further, but that was the limit of the burst of enlightenment he\u2019d obtained from the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2019 seal.I already planned to unlock the Sword of the Nine Hell\u2019s secrets in this lifetime. I obtained that initial burst of enlightenment from it before reincarnating, so why can\u2019t I get another after reincarnating?Gradually, Su Yi\u2019s hesitation gave way to determination.The Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra it is!Universal self-embodiment. Universal transformation.The core of this Daoist sutra was that it could use any power of heaven and earth to temper the soul.And as the soul increased in power, it could manifest every heavenly and earthly phenomenon, from all aspects to nature to entire worlds.The word \u201cuniversal\u201d referred to \u201cheaven and earth\u201d and \u201cthe Grand Dao.\u201dUpon cultivating this sutra, the soul became like a \u201cuniverse\u201d in its own right. It could absorb the energies of heaven, earth, and the Grand Dao to temper itself, as well as to manifest the countless subtle mysteries and intrinsic qualities of creation. Its wondrousness was indescribable.Upon cultivating it to the Imperial Realm, you could manifest vestiges of the heaven\u2019s ten thousand Daos within your soul, which you could then put to use in unbelievable ways.This was what it meant to manifest creation in all forms, to create worlds within oneself.Universal Self-Embodiment. This naturally means I can draw upon any form of energy and use it to temper my soul!The Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra is undoubtedly the ideal method in a spiritually-barren place like the Azure Continent.After making his decision, Su Yi hesitated no further. He turned his focus to pondering how exactly he\u2019d go about cultivating this soul cultivation technique.Although the ambient spiritual energy of the Azure Continent was sparse, these lands included numerous other potentially usable energies.Like baleful or yin energy.Cultivating the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra meant you could make ample use of these energies too.It was no exaggeration to say that this sutra could put even the power of the sun, moon, stars, and the qi of every living creature of the mortal realm to use!This was the essence of the phrase \u201cSelf-Embodiment\u201dIt was not subject to the shackles of heaven and earth, not restricted to the ten thousand Daos. Anything and everything could be put to use!If I use the power of the Sword of the Nine Hells to temper my soul, will that result in a similar miraculous effect?\u00a0Su Yi\u2019s heart shook.The Sword of the Nine Hells had always drifted within his soul. If he could use its power, he wouldn\u2019t need to concern himself with searching the world for other sources of energy with which to temper his soul.Besides, the subtle mysteries of the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra originated from the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2019 nine-layered seal in the first place. His initial burst of enlightenment came from the sword, so it was fair to say the sword and sutra were connected.Su Yi promptly decided to give it a shot.Even if he encountered danger, all he had to do was stop promptly.Hah~\u00a0Su Yi let out a breath of turbid air, then cleared his mind.After casting aside all his scattered thoughts, he silently circulated the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra\u2019s cultivation method.He used his soul to visualize heaven and earth, and heaven and earth appeared.He used his soul to visualize mountains and seas, and mountains and seas appeared.He used his soul to visualize the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2026.He silently pictured the shape of the Sword of the Nine Hells, its aura and its charm, outlining it bit by bit, painting it within his mental sea.It was as an invisible\u00a0brush were painting\u00a0a formless scroll, delineating the outline of the sword and vaguely capturing charms\u2026.Bit by bit, he outlined the nine layers of Divine Chains wrapped around the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2026..Every layer\u2019s shape, position, and luster appeared in perfect detail.But even now, it was still just \u201csuperficially reminiscent\u201d of the true Sword of the Nine Hells.Next, Su Yi began attempting to visualize the sword\u2019s aura.Because only by visualizing it in its entirety, down to its subtle charms, could he make use of its power to refine his soul.But although Su Yi was scrupulously cautious, the instant he began visualizing the sword\u2019s aura, something expected happened.Boom!The nine layers of chain suddenly rattled, emitting nine completely different sealing energies, as sudden as a collapsing mountain or a tidal wave.Presences of this level were overly terrifying; each seemed capable of destroying all of creation. They were as despotic as flame, as icy as snow, as unbridled as wind, or as steady as mountains\u2026.Now, all nine erupted at once, like nine gods awakening within Su Yi\u2019s soul, their respective auras overflowing. Their powers seemed as if they\u2019d easily rip Su Yi\u2019s soul to shreds!But then\u2026.Before the nine sealing energies could overflow, a low, clear hum rang out. The Sword of the Nine Hells shook, emitting a vast, dense, ancient aura and suppressing the seals\u2019 nine distinct energies.The nine Divine Chains all fell silent. All was just as it had been before.The Sword of the Nine Hells stilled as well.As if that terrifying scene from mere moments ago were nothing but a hallucination.But Su Yi was already so startled, he was covered in a cold sweat.Who knew how many years he\u2019d spent researching the Sword of the Nine Hells in his past life? Yet despite all his efforts, nothing so unbelievable had occurred before.Who would have thought that merely visualizing the sword would set off such a chain reaction?It seems the nine Divine Chains sealing the sword are fiercely opposed to my attempts to comprehend their energies, while the Sword of the Nine Hells itself did me an enormous favor\u2026.\u00a0After Su Yi regained his composure, he keenly picked up on something strange.Logically speaking, the nine layers of chains should be there to seal away the Sword of the Nine Hells, but it seemed reality didn\u2019t quite mesh with his assumptions.On the contrary, the sword seemed to be suppressing the Divine Chains!In that case, whatever secret is hidden within the nine-layered chains is far out of the ordinary,\u00a0pondered Su Yi.After a while, he shook his head, then gave the matter no further thought.At his current cultivation, he was nowhere near capable of fathoming the mysteries of the nine Divine Chains.He controlled his breath, focused, and resumed visualizing.Within his mental sea, he restarted gradually outlining the sword and its nine-layered seal.Then, without any hesitation, he began visualizing the Sword of the Nine Hells\u2019 aura and distinctive charm.A familiar scene appeared. The nine Divine Chains rattled, emanating a terrifying energy, but before it could burst borth, the Sword of the Nine Hells suppressed it.But this time, Su Yi didn\u2019t pause his cultivation. He simply continued visualizing.An unknown amount of time later\u2026.Su Yi\u2019s soul captured a wisp of an obscure, marvelous charm, and he managed to visualize it within the outline of the Sword of the Nine Hells.Su Yi instantly felt his soul tremble. An unbelievable flood of power coursed through his awareness, like boiling water or tumbling rapids.This surge of power came in ten varieties.One came from the Sword of the Nine Hells itself. It was vast and ancient, profound, subtle, and inscrutable.Although Su Yi could sense its existence, he couldn\u2019t even begin to sense the subtleties of its power.The other energies came from the nine-layered Divine Chains.The chains of the first layer emananted a power like wind: willful, wanton, unrestrained, and incomparably despotic.The second blazed like fire, so hot, it seemed as if it could burn all of creation to cinders.The third was as cold as snow\u2026..Each distinct power had its own terrifying momentum, each towering like gods of their respective Grand Daos!Alas, just like the Sword of the Nine Hell\u2019s aura, although he could sense their presences, that was it. He couldn\u2019t visualize or outline them.The only exception was the ninth seal. He could sense a trace of its energy!That burst of enlightenment power he\u2019d captured before his reincarnation was from the sealing power of the ninth Divine Chain too.\u2018The Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra I\u2019m currently circulating comes from a power of enlightenment originating from the ninth Divine Chain.Perhaps this is why, when I attempted to sense it with my soul, it resulted in a compatibility with the energy of the ninth Divine Chain\u2026.A thread of enlightenment rose within Su Yi\u2019s heart.His cultivation experience was so ample that he immediately determined that the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra was like a key; it could open the \u201clock\u201d that was the nine-layered Divine Chains!What made Su Yi even more excited was that this discovery proved beyond a doubt that as he tempered his soul, he could indeed make use of the power contained within the ninth seal!In this way, he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about seeking out other sources of power with which to refine his soul.As my soul cultivation boundary rises step by step, I should be able to achieve a deeper compatibility with the power of the ninth seal. When the time comes, I\u2019ll naturally be able to unlock its secrets!This sudden enlightenment left Su Yi beside himself with excitement.In his past life, despite countless years of research, he never discovered a way to unlock the secrets of the Sword of the Nine Hells.But now, there was finally light at the end of the tunnel. With this, he could forge a path ahead, step by step!Of course he was excited!But before long, Su Yi\u2019s lips twitched subtly.He got so excited just now that all his visualizations collapsed again\u2026.But Su Yi was already satisfied.Tonight\u2019s experiment had resulted in an enormous harvest, the kind of fortune that could be found but not sought.After all, if he hadn\u2019t decided to use the Universal Self-Embodiment Sutra to refine his soul, how could he have discovered all these exquisite profundities?\u2026\u2026Noon the next day.The skies were bright and clear, and the breeze was gentle and refreshing.Su Yi wore his blue robes, his dark hair pinned up in a top-knot. He gripped his bamboo staff in his right hand as he exited his chambers.He then walked right out of the courtyard without any trace of reluctance.Click!The moment he locked the gates, he effectively announced the end of this stage of his life. The curtain was about to open on a brand-new journey\u201cTake care, sir!\u201d When he saw Su Yi leave, the Apricot Clinic\u2019s steward, Hu Quan, as well as Wu Guangbin and the other doctors, all set aside the tasks at hand and walked out to bid Su Yi farewell, one by one. All of them seemed reluctant to part with him.During their time with Su Yi, his skills and elegant bearing had won them all over.His leniency and the fact that he\u2019d never once chastised any of them only made them respect him even more.As a result, when they learned that Su Yi was about to leave for faraway lands, and that it was uncertain when or if he\u2019d return, they all sank into deep melancholy.\u201cYou can all get back to work.\u201d Su Yi smiled and waved them farewell. Then, beneath their collective gazes, he exited the Apricot Clinic.A horse-drawn carriage was already waiting by the side of the road.The driver was none other than the commander of the Old Guard, Nie Beihu!He smiled, clasped his fist, and said, \u201cMaster Su, City Lord Fu and the others are waiting by the banks of the Great Azure. Please board the carriage and allow me to escort you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - His Highness, His Martial Aunt, and a Young DaoistOutside of Guangling City.A massive tower ship was docked along the banks of the magnificent Great Azure River.Its main tower had nine stories, and it was topped by twelve pagodas. Each was ornately carved and colorfully painted, and all of them had an old-fashioned charm.Numerous passengers stood on the decks, gazing at the distant Guangling City.Some had disembarked, seizing this rare lull to stroll or play along the riverbank, while others went and bought refreshments. It was quite a lively sight.When Su Yi arrived, City Lord Fu Shan, Yuan Luoxi, and Cheng Wuyong were already there waiting for him.Surprisingly, Huang Yunchong and Huang Qianjun were there too.\u201cMaster Su.\u201d They each greeted him in turn.The sight of so many influential people greeting a youth like Su Yi so respectfully instantly attracted a good deal of attention. Even some of the passengers still on board looked over.\u201cWhat about your other attendants?\u201d Su Yi glanced at Yuan Luoxi.\u201cThey\u2019re returning on horseback. I sent them on their way last night.\u201d Yuan Luoxi still wore military attire. She looked valiant, but also charming and beautiful.Su Yi nodded, then turned his attention toward Huang Yunchong and son. He laughed, \u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201dHuang Yunchong hurriedly smiled and said, \u201cMaster Su, now that you mention it, it\u2019s really quite the coincidence. I was already planning to send Qianjun to cultivate in Blueriver Sword Manor sometime in the next few days. Last night, City Lord Fu just happened to inform me that you were boarding this very vessel and heading towards the prefectural capital, so I wondered if it\u2019d be possible for my son to travel with you. I asked around today, and indeed, there happened to be a few empty spots left, so I brought my son and hurried over.\u201dSu Yi laughed, but said nothing.Huang Qianjun looked a bit awkward; it was obvious to everyone that this so-called \u201ccoincidence\u201d was actually anything but!But when they saw that Su Yi had no objections, neither Fu Shan nor Cheng Wuyong pointed this out. They just smiled in silence.The only exception was Yuan Luoxi, whose eyebrows shot up skeptically. \u201cLast night, Uncle Yong said that the tower ship was fully booked. We only got in thanks to City Lord Fu Shan pulling some strings. Don\u2019t tell me the ticket salesman was tricking us?\u201dHuang Yunchong coughed. \u201cMiss Yuan, there\u2019s an old saying that sums it up nicely: \u2018money makes the world go round.\u2019 Offer enough cash, and you\u2019ll surely find someone willing to give up their spot.\u201dYuan Luoxi instantly understood. \u201cAh, so you just threw money at the problem. I can do that too.\u201d\u201c\u2018I can do that too\u2019? What are you saying\u2026?\u201d Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but find it funny.As they chatted, a man with coppery skin, a halberd-shaped beard, grey robes, and a determined expression walked over\u201cOl\u2019 Fu, we\u2019re about to depart. Are these the distinguished guests you spoke of?\u201d asked the elder in grey.He was clad in worn grey warrior\u2019s robes, a saber and bow at his waist. Despite his age, he was imposing, and he emanated a faint murderous intent.As he spoke, his gaze swept across the group. He directly ignored Su Yi, Huang Qianjun, and Yuan Luoxi, the three youths.It was only when his gaze landed on Cheng Wuyong that he paused briefly, and his brow lifted in mild surprise.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Fu Shan nodded, smiled, and introduced him. \u201cThis is the Roving City of Commerce\u2019s commander of the guards, Zhang Yiren. He fought under the banner of the Spiritmartial Marquis\u2019 Greenplate Army for twenty years. He commanded ten thousand warriors, and his entire Martial Dao was achieved and polished on the battlefield. He\u2019s as brave and heroic as it gets.\u201dThe grey-robed Zhang Yiren waved him away. \u201cOl\u2019 Fu, no need to flatter me. Of late, I\u2019m nothing but a humble security guard. You could say I\u2019ve given my life to\u00a0this here boat.\u201dDespite Zhang Yiren\u2019s objections, Cheng Wuyong cupped his fists. \u201cSo, you were a martial artist beneath the Spiritmartial Marquis, Chen Zheng\u2019s banner. I apologize for not recognizing you earlier.The Spiritmartial Marquis, Chen Zheng!He was in the top five among the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s eighteen \u201cforeign-surnamed\u201d marquises. Chen Zheng and his Greenplate Army were stationed in \u201cthe Bloodthistle Yao Mountains\u201d. They\u2019d killed countless yao, accumulating enormous military merit, and their name shook the entire nation.Zhang Yiren said in mild surprise, \u201cFriend, you know our marquis?\u201d\u201cI was once fortunate enough to witness Marquis Chen Zheng slaying the great \u2018Jade Snake\u2019. He had the bearing of a deity; I admire him greatly to this day.\u201dZhang Yiren\u2019s face lit up. \u201cOnce everyone\u2019s on board, I\u2019m inviting you over for a drink. Let\u2019s have ourselves a nice chat!\u201dHe then glanced up at the sky and said, \u201cIt\u2019s already time to depart. Everyone, please follow me on board.\u201dFu Shan had planned to introduce everyone one by one, but when he saw this, he could only give up on the idea.\u201cOl\u2019 Fu, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d Zhang Yiren waved, then strode towards the ship. Su Yi and company followed.Before long, all the passengers were back on board.It was only after the massive tower ship gradually faded from view that Fu Shan, Nie Biehu, and Huang Yunchong retracted their gazes.\u201cA wise man lies low and waits for the opportune moment. Who knows how many waves Master Su will make during his visit to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital?\u201d Fu Shan sighed with emotion.He had a premonition that with Su Yi\u2019s abilities, he could easily bring a storm to the prefectural capital!Nie Beihu and Huang Yunchong\u2019s hearts coursed with emotion as well.\u2026\u2026A young man watched them board from the ornate window of his room within one of the tower ship\u2019s twelve pavilions. He then turned to his companion and asked with great interest, \u201cMartial Aunt Qing Jin, can you tell who that youth in the blue robes is?\u201dHe wore pale purple robes, and he wore a feather headdress. He had a jade belt around his waist, and he was handsome and upright. He stood there with his hands behind his back, emanating a formless air of nobility.\u201cYou\u2019ll know if you send someone to ask, won\u2019t you?\u201d said the woman reclining against the window lattice disinterestedly.She looked about seventeen or eighteen. Her features were perfectly formed, and her dark hair was tied in a ponytail. Her skin looked as smooth and delicate as porcelain, and beneath her eyebrows, her eyes glinted like knives.She had a prideworthy figure, and although her clothes were plain, white, and loosely-fitted, they couldn\u2019t hide her ample chest or delicate waist. She was entirely unadorned, her attire plain as could be save for the jade bracelet on her snowy white wrist, which only further offset her fair complexion.\u201cMartial Aunt Qing Jin, you\u2019re perfect in every way\u2026. Except you\u2019re too lazy! You don\u2019t care about anything at all. That\u2019s no good, you know!\u201d The purple robed youth in the feather headdress sighed and shook his head.\u201cThese mundane affairs are nowhere near as satisfying as killing yao, and there\u2019s nothing worthy of my concern. Besides, on this operation, I\u2019m only responsible for ensuring your safety. I can\u2019t be bothered with anything else.\u201d The woman snorted sluggishly, then turned and climbed onto the couch, stretched that praiseworthy figure of hers, and shut her sharp, beautiful eyes.She was like a lazy little cat, not the least bit dignified, yet with an unrestrained, wild beauty.The purple-robed youth was stunned despite himself, and his heart shook.But when he recalled how ferocious this martial aunt of his was when she lost her temper, he shuddered, then looked away.\u201cGo ahead and rest, Martial Aunt. I\u2019m going out for a walk.\u201d He turned and left the room.The girl\u2019s pink lips parted, and she muttered indistinctly, \u201cIf you run into danger, just yell.\u201d A moment later, she was fast asleep.\u201cDanger? This is the Spiritmartial Marquis\u2019 tower ship. What danger could there possibly be?\u201d said the youth with a smile, not the least bit concerned. He exited the room, then closed the door.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d A middle-aged man stood guard outside, his bearing as steady and grave as a mountain.\u201cWe have to maintain secrecy during this operation, and we cannot allow anyone suspicious onto the ship. Zhang Duo, go investigate the origins of that group Zhang Yiren just led on board.\u201dThe purple-robed, headdressed youth reminded him, \u201cRemember, be polite, and don\u2019t reveal our identities.\u201dThe middle-aged Zhang Duo said solemnly, \u201cYes, sir!\u201dBut when he saw that the purple-robed youth was headed out the door, Zhang Duo couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYour Highness, where are you going?\u201d\u201cSh!\u201d The youth in the headdress put his finger to his lip. He then glanced toward the door furtively and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to find Miss Cha Jin for a game of chess. If I can hear her play a tune, even better.\u201d\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Zhang Duo said with obvious concern, \u201cJust in case, we\u2019d best have Miss Qing Jin accompany you. That way, I\u2019ll be able to rest at ease too\u2026.\u201dBut the youth in headdress ignored him, then left on his own. Zhang Duo couldn\u2019t help but grimace.\u00a0His Highness would be perfect in every way, except that he\u2019s a bit overly amorous\u2026.He shook his head, then turned and left in a hurry. He decided to first seek out Zhang Yiren for a chat and ask about that group who\u2019d just boarded the tower ship.Back within the room, the \u201cfast asleep\u201d Qing Jin laughed coldly.\u00a0Men are all the same!\u2026\u2026The Wen Family\u2019s Floral Tea House.The matriarch examined the letter she\u2019d just written.It was addressed to Wen Lingzhao.Its contents were simple. It essentially just told her that, should she encounter Su Yi, she ought to treat him as a passerby.And more importantly, the letter said she shouldn\u2019t be in such a hurry to dissolve their marriage. This was because, according to the matriarch\u2019s predictions, the more of a fuss Su Yi kicked up, the closer he was to death.Once Su Yi got himself killed, their marriage contract would end on its own.After carefully rereading the letter several times to ensure she conveyed her point clearly enough to avoid misunderstandings, she found an envelope and sealed it.It was then that a servant reported from outside the doors, \u201cMatriarch, just now, Wen Family son-in-law Su Yi boarded the tower ship and departed the city.\u201dThe Wen Family matriarch was stunned. She sank into a brief silence, then sighed to herself,\u00a0Third Young Master, had you remained in the Wen Family and quietly lived out your days as a live-in son-in-law, you might have made it to a ripe old age. Why insist on making waves? You\u2019re just seeking your own annihilation\u2026.She was keenly aware of just how terrifying the Jade Capital\u2019s Su Family was. That level of authority was enough to make even the world\u2019s Martial Dao Grandmasters shake in their boots!\u2026\u2026On the three hundred, ninety-ninth year of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the sixth day of the second lunar month, Su Yi boarded the tower ship and left Guangling City.That night, the skies above Mother Ghost Ridge were as dark as ink.A swift immortal crane beat its knifelike wings, slicing holes through the layers of cloud. It drifted down into the mountains and landed outside the peach orchard.A figure jumped from its back.It was a youth in apricot robes, a bright-eyed, dashing young man.The young Daoist gently rubbed the crane\u2019s head, then commanded, \u201cCraney, you rest here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dWith that, he dashed into the peach forest.The clouds of multicolored Peachblossom Miasma receded like the tides, clearing a path for him.Before long, the Pure Yang Fire Peach Tree came into view.The young\u00a0Daoist\u2019s\u00a0gaze swept around the area, and he clasped his fist. \u201cTao Qingshan, where are you? I am Ge Qian, and I am here to pick Fire Peaches on my master, the Sea-Swallowing King Ge Changling\u2019s orders.\u201dSeth's ThoughtsJust fyi, I originally had Qing Jin's title translated literally as \"Uncle Master\" but have decided to change it to \"martial aunt\" due to reader feedback.\u5e08\u53d4 and \u5e08\u4f2f (the terms translated as uncle master/martial uncle) contain words that clearly refer to a father's brothers. They're not gender neutral, except in this specific context. Calling Qing Jin \"uncle master\" is a literal translation.However, calling a woman \"martial uncle/uncle master\" seems needlessly weird and confusing in English, and I don't believe in being 100% literal all the time. Certaintly I don't believe in being literal at the cost of confusing readers.Also, I'll be changing Zhou Huaiqiu's title to match. He'll now be \"Martial Uncle Zhou Huaiqiu.\" Why? Because while I like \"uncle master\" and \"martial uncle\" equally, \"martial aunt\" sounds a lot better than \"aunt master\" to me. And I at least try and keep my terminology consistent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Carrying an Old Man Everywhere You GoThe mists circulated around the Fire Peach Tree, manifesting the dwarvish figure of Tao Qingshan.He said suspiciously, \u201cAre you the Sea-Swallowing King\u2019s disciple?\u201d\u201cHere is my master\u2019s command token.\u201d The young Daoist smiled and took out a jade medallion and waved it in the air. It was engraved with clouds that condensed into the character \u201cGe.\u201dTao Qingshan instantly grew reverent. \u201cPlease forgive me for not going out to welcome you personally.\u201dGe Qian put away the medallion. \u201cAccording to my master\u2019s estimates, there ought to be ripe Fire Peaches on the tree right about now. I\u2019ll have to trouble you to fetch them for me.Tao Qingshan went rigid, then said hesitantly, \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, Young Lord. You\u2019re one step too late. Just two days ago, there were indeed three ripe Fire Peaches, but someone already came and took them away.\u201dGe Qian frowned. \u201cWho took them?\u201dTao Qingshan hurriedly pointed at the stone stele. \u201cYoung Lord, please look.\u201dGe Qian looked over and saw a new line of casually elegant text: \u201cOn the fourth day of the second month of the Great Zhou\u2019s calendar, Su Yi took three Fire Peaches and left.\u201dGe Qian\u2019s brow furrowed even deeper. \u201cWho is this \u2018Su Yi\u2019?\u201dTao Qingshan\u2019s heart quivered. \u201cYoung Lord, Su Yi is a mystic master possessed of vast supernatural powers. His methods are simply unbelievable; from my perspective, he\u2019s like a banished immortal descending upon the mortal plane, a transcendent existence. But I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know his origins.\u201dGe Qian pondered for a moment, then said, \u201cHe was well aware that my master claimed this land long ago, yet he still dared leave with the Fire Peaches, and even leave his name upon Master\u2019s stone stele? No ordinary man would have the courage to do such a thing.\u201d\u201cYoung Lord, I don\u2019t think Mystic Master Su Yi is wicked,\u201d said Tao Qingshan cautiously. \u201cHe seemed more like an enlightened being. Before he left, he said that if His Excellency the Sea-Swallowing King wishes to blame someone, he should look for him directly.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not even afraid of my master?\u201d Surprise arose on Ge Qian\u2019s face. He thought, then asked, \u201cDo you remember what he looks like?\u201d\u201cJust a moment, please,\u201d said Tao Qingshan hurriedly. He then plucked a green leaf from the Fire Peach Tree and used his fingernail to carve an outline. With a burst of spiritual light, a tall, lean figure appeared on the leaf\u2019s surface.He held a bamboo staff and had his hair tied up. He had an ethereal, otherworldly air.Ge Qian examined the image closely, looking stunned. \u201cAnd here I thought he was an expert of the older generation. Who\u2019d have thought he\u2019d be a young man\u2026?\u201dTao Qingshan explained, \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that he\u2019s mastered the art of eternal youth. After all, someone like Mystic Master Su Yi has long since transcended the ordinary martial artists of the mundane world.\u201dGe Qian glanced at him. \u201cIt seems you\u2019re rather frightened of this Su Yi?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you,\u201d said Tao Qingshan hurriedly. \u201cI feel nothing but awe and reverence for Mystic Master Su Yi.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Ge Qian. He paused, then shouted, his voice booming like thunder. \u201cTao Qingshan!\u201dThe dwarf\u2019s body went rigid, and he instinctively looked up, then saw a flash of faint purple light shine in Ge Qian\u2019s eyes.Tao Qingshan felt his soul buzz, then he lost all awareness and stood there, frozen.A hint of barely perceptible exasperation arose on Ge Qian\u2019s handsome face. \u201cOld Man, I\u2019ll leave the soul searching up to you. I just want to know if Tao Qingshan is telling the truth or not.\u201dAs he said this, something palpitated within his soul. A burst of low, raspy laughter soon followed. \u201cIn exchange, after you obtain the Pure Yang Fire Peaches, you have to give me half.\u201dGe Qian twinged in pain. \u201cAn existence on your level has no need for such low-grade spiritual materials, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true; I have no need for a tier-four Fire Peach, but those are the rules. My goal is to make you understand: to obtain something, you must first pay the corresponding price.\u201dThe raspy voice continued, \u201cWork hard, young man! The more you put in, the more you\u2019ll get out. With me here, you are the chosen son of heaven! Your future accomplishments in the Dao will exceed that \u2018master\u2019 of yours a hundred times\u2014no, a thousand! I\u2019m sure of it!\u201dHis tone seemed designed to entice.But Ge Qian merely laughed. \u201cOld Man, if you were really all that, what need would you have to seek refuge within my soul? And when I\u2019m in front of my master, you\u2019re always too scared to even say a peep! Look at you now, bragging like that. Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201dThat raspy voice fell silent, then sighed. \u201cShrimp can torment a dragon in shallow waters, and dogs can bully tigers on open plains. If not for\u2026. Forget it, no need to go into that. Those who know me ask about my troubles, while those who don\u2019t question my motives!\u201dGe Qian snickered, then said as if coaxing a small child. \u201cLet\u2019s get to work now! If you do, I\u2019ll give you delicious peaches!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dGe Qian heard a cold snort, then felt a stinging pain in his eyes as whirlpools of purple light surged through his pupils. He fixed his gaze on Tao Qingshan.\u00a0A moment later, that raspy voice exclaimed in surprise, sounding grave.\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Ge Qian asked hurriedly.After a lengthy silence, the raspy voice responded, \u201cThat Su Yi is merely a Blood Circulation Realm Youth, not some old monster making himself look young. But\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d Ge Qian was a little frantic. This was the first time he\u2019d seen the \u201cold man\u201d in his soul dither like this.Historically, he talked about even Earthly Immortals as if they were beneath his notice.\u201cAll I can say is, there\u2019s something strange about Su Yi. He likely has secrets no one else knows!\u201dThe raspy voice paused, then suddenly suggested, \u201cLittle fellow, I have a certain premonition that if you overpower Su Yi and force him into submission, you might very well obtain an unexpectedly grand stroke of fortune. How about it? Want to give it a shot?\u201dGe Qian instantly went on guard, but outwardly, he feigned disinterest. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good enough reason. Besides, I\u2019m a natural-born coward. Even Master says he\u2019s never seen anyone so scrupulously cautious in his life. I have to cover my eyes just to kill a chicken.\u201d\u201c.....\u201d The raspy voice fell briefly silent. \u201cBut he stole three Fire Peaches. As Ge Changling\u2019s disciple, shouldn\u2019t you get even with him? How about this? So long as\u00a0you go deal\u00a0with that Su\u00a0Yi, I can make an exception and act directly! Whatever benefits we obtain, we can split fifty-fifty. That ought to be good enough, right?\u201dBut this only put Ge Qian more on edge.He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll report this incident\u00a0to Master, and let him decide how to respond.\u201dThe raspy voice was clearly frantic. \u201cWhat right does a coward like you have to talk about standing above the world and suppressing all enemies in his path? Feh! Your master\u2019s right about you; you\u2019re a coward right down to your bones!\u201dGe Qian merely laughed, not the least bit upset. \u201cI\u2019ll live longer if I don\u2019t play games with my life. Being careful is never a bad thing. If I listen to you and go after Su Yi, and if he has other secrets about him, it won\u2019t just be the end of me, Old Man. Your soul will scatter into nothingness too.\u201dWith that, he turned and left the peach orchard. His apricot robes fluttered, but his handsome face was grim.\u00a0This was the first time he\u2019d seen the old man hiding in his soul so desperate to deal with a youth roughly his age!This put Ge Qian on guard.On their way back, the raspy voice fell silent. It seemed he\u2019d realized that no matter what he said, it would be almost impossible to change Ge Qian\u2019s decision.\u201cSu Yi, you stole my master\u2019s peaches. You\u2019ll definitely pay for this. Perhaps it won\u2019t be long before I go looking for you\u2026.\u201d Gu Qian emerged from the peach orchard, exhaled, then flew away on his immortal crane.\u2026\u2026A massive tower boat floated atop the Great Azure River.The ninth pavilion.\u201cMaster Su, this pavilion has two stories. You take the second floor, and we\u2019ll take the first,\u201d said Yuan Luoxi crisply.The tower ship had nine stories, as well as twelve standalone pavilions. Occupying a pavilion wasn\u2019t simply a matter of money; it required sufficient connections, too.Take their pavilion: It was Fu Shan\u2019s relationship with Zhang Yiren that got them in.\u201cThis place is really nice.\u201d Huang Qianjun looked around, his heart filled with emotion.The pavilion only had two stories, but it had its own courtyard, and it was fully furnished and outfitted with daily necessities. The decor had an old-fashioned charm, and from the latticed windows, they had a clear view of the banks of the Great Azure.\u201cHow about you stay here too?\u201d said Su Yi offhandedly.\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Huang Qianjun was extremely tempted. His father had spent a lot of money to get him a room aboard the tower ship. His cabin was within the nine stories of the main tower, and it was a first-class room too.But how could that compare with a stand-alone pavilion?\u201cHow about this? The second floor has two rooms. You take one of them.\u201dWhy would Su Yi care about such details? He went ahead and made the decision on Huang Qianjun\u2019s behalf.Huang Qianjun instantly beamed. He was so happy, he couldn\u2019t help but thank Su Yi repeatedly.Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but reevaluate him. She realized that Su Yi seemed closer to Huang Qianjun than to her.Once everything was in order, the group sat at the table in the courtyard, sipped tea, and rested.\u201cMaster Su, during my conversation with Zhang Yiren, he made a point of telling me that eight hundred spirit beasts are caged on the first five floors of the tower ship.\u201d Cheng Wuyong suddenly spoke up. \u201cAll of them are from the Bloodthistle Yao Mountain. They\u2019re all spoils of war captured alive by the Spiritmartial Marquis\u2019 Greenplate Army. He urged us not to go near them.\u201d\u201cSpirit beasts?\u201d Su Yi was stunned. \u201cWhy capture so many beasts alive?\u201dThere were numerous inhospitable regions of the Great Zhou. Such places were perilous, and they were typically home to spirit beasts and other yao.Take the Bloodthistle Yao Mountain the Spiritmartial Marquis was stationed at. It was one of the Great Zhou\u2019s famed \u201cEight Great Yao Mountains.\u201dThe Great Zhou divided Spirit beasts into nine tiers based on their threat level.Tier-one was the weakest; they were only marginally more powerful than ordinary wild beasts.Tier-nine was the strongest. Such beasts already had a degree of sentience, and they had innate talent and inborn yao energy. Ordinary Martial Dao Grandmasters would have to run for their lives upon encountering them.Only Xiantian Martial Ancestors had a fighting chance.Within the Great Zhou, there were rumors of levels above tier-nine. People said that yao spirits existed too. These were terrifying existences capable of contending with Earthly Immortals.But of course, Su Yi knew that this classification system only applied to the Azure Continent.In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, even tiny, ordinary sects could easily dispose of so-called \u201cyao spirits.\u201d\u201cMost of the spirit beasts are headed for the prefectural capital for peak-level factions to purchase. They\u2019re used as whetstones to sharpen warriors\u2019 Martial Daos. Factions like Heaven\u2019s Origin Academy, Blueriver Sword Manor, the Governor\u2019s Estate, as well as our Yuan Family purchase live beasts from the battlefield year-round,\u201d explained Cheng Wuyong. \u201cThis is common practice throughout the Great Zhou. After all, a warrior who\u2019s never experienced bloodshed is unworthy of the title.\u201dWhen he heard that, Huang Qianjun\u2019s face heated up in embarrassment. Despite all his years of life, he\u2019d never even seen a spirit beast, much less killed one.He couldn\u2019t help but ask in a whisper, \u201cMiss Yuan, have you killed a spirit beast before?\u201dYuan Luoxi rolled her eyes then said derisively, \u201c When I was nine years old, I used a knife to stab a stork spirit to death. From that day forth, I\u2019ve been certain to kill a spirit beast of one sort or another once a week. I\u2019ve long since lost track of how many yao have perished at my hands. You\u2019re asking \u2018if I\u2019ve ever killed one before\u2019? What a joke!\u201dHer shiny pink lips curved upward with unspoken pride.Miss Yuan, your words are like a dagger to the heart\u2026!\u00a0Huang Qianjun felt the sudden urge to cover his face and flee the room.Seth's Thoughts\u201cThose who know me ask about my troubles, while those who don\u2019t question my motives!\u201dThis is a line of poetry. You can find the full poem the Old Man in Ge Qian\u2019s soul quotes\u00a0here. It\u2019s number 65, \u9ecd\u96e2 \u00a0SHU LI.____The terms used here might be a bit unclear, so here\u2019s a somewhat more detailed explanation. The author has been somewhat vague, and there's a lot we don't know yet, so it\u2019s possible that I\u2019ve misunderstood some of the finer points. This is just how I understand it:Spirit beasts are a type of yao, but more animal-like. They\u2019re not fully sentient, but their sentience increases with their strength. At low levels, they\u2019re basically just animals, but they\u2019re strong enough to contend with cultivators. At high levels, they still look like animals, and they can\u2019t talk, but they\u2019re intelligent. They cannot take on human form or feign a human appearance. Think \u201canimals, but stronger and with more potential.\u201dThis is in contrast to a fully sentient nature spirit like Tao Qingshan. Think \u201cunsexy dryads\u201d. Nature spirits can and do include animals, though, which weren\u2019t necessarily spirit beasts to begin with. Tao Qingshan can appear in human form, but he has yet to cast aside the limitations of his original body.The text hasn\u2019t said anything about this outright, but you can probably assume that plants/animals that become nature spirits were either special to begin with (ie they were spiritual materials or spirit beasts) OR that they had some kind of lucky encounter ie \u201cthey just happened to grow beside a spiritual spring\u201d or \u201cthey ate a special medicinal herb.\u201d Tao Qingshan falls into the former category, as the Pure Yang Fire Peach Tree is a high-quality material. We have not seen any yao in the latter category, but then, Tao Qingshan is the first yao to appear unless you count the great peng in the first chapter. And a great peng was definitely special to begin with.Note that nature spirits are not necessarily stronger than spirit beasts. They're just different categories of (relatively low-level) yao.We don't know much about proper yao cultivators yet, but it sounds like the line that separates them from lesser yao is that they've shed the metaphorical shackles of their true body. Tao Qingshan is appearing in human form, but that\u2019s more like the tree\u2019s avatar; he\u2019s still fundamentally a peach tree. A proper yao cultivator (presumably) still has some connection to their original body, but they will spend most of their time in human form, and their human(oid) body is the real deal.In short:No sentience= normal plants and animals or low-level spirit beasts/spiritual medicinesSome degree of sentience but cannot take on a human appearance= high-level spirit beastsFull sentience, and can appear in human form, but lacks a truly human body= Nature SpiritsFully sentient, has a fully humanoid body, and has cast aside the shackles of their original animal/plantlike body= full-fledged yao cultivatorHopefully that helps!___I might need to change the term \"yao spirits\" later. It's a literal translation, but I don't like it, and the word spirit is over-used.... But that's what it says, and I temporarily can't think of anything better. I'll revisit the term when it becomes more relevant to the plot. If I change the term, I'll let you know in another note.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - The Targeted Young NobleCheng Wuyong grinned as he watched this play out, but when he sensed that Su Yi didn\u2019t seem interested, he hurriedly changed the subject. \u201cAccording to Zhang Yiren, there\u2019s a mysterious VIP guest aboard the tower ship. He\u2019s currently staying in the first pavilion.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Yuan Luoxi curiously.\u201cZhang Yiren wasn\u2019t sure either. He just knows that Chen Zheng, the Spiritmartial Marquis, pulled some strings to get him on board. He suspects he\u2019s the son of some noble family. Although he only has four guards with him, every one of them has a cultivation in the Qi Accumulation Realm.\u201dYuan Luoxi\u2019s beautiful eyes were suddenly serious. \u201cHe\u2019s sure traveling in style. I\u2019m afraid that even in the Jade Capital, only scions of peak-level clans and factions can enjoy such treatment.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not all there is to this young noble. He also has a woman with him, and although she\u2019s only seventeen or eighteen, Zhang Yiren, a late-stage Qi Accumulation expert, felt his heart shake facing her. According to him, it\u2019s highly likely that she\u2019s a Martial Dao Grandmaster!\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d exclaimed both Yuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun.\u00a0A seventeen-year-old Martial Dao Grandmaster?\u00a0Do monsters like that really exist in this world?\u201cThat\u2019s just Zhang Yiren\u2019s speculation. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true or not either, but what I can be sure of is that this young lord\u2019s origins aren\u2019t simple.\u201dAs he said this, Cheng Wuyong discovered that Su Yi was just sipping away at his tea, tranquil and composed, as if this topic didn\u2019t arouse his interest at all either.Cheng Wuyong couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u00a0I wonder, just what in this world can pique the interest of someone like Master Su?Wealth?Authority?Women?I\u2019m afraid none will suffice.Suddenly, the clear, sweet sound of a zither as ethereal as mists and rain emanated from a distance. The melody had a poetic, picturesque charm, sending listeners into a dazed reverie.They couldn\u2019t help but stop and strain to listen.But although no one else noticed, Su Yi\u2019s brow furrowed at the sound.It was only after the music faded away that Huang Qianjun could no longer hold back his praise. \u201cThat was simply divine! It was as gentle and soothing as a spring breeze; I feel refreshed!\u201d\u201cIt really was lovely. It had no traces of conscious artistry; it floated like clouds and flowed like rivers, as if it were formed naturally.\u201d Yuan Luoxi nodded and commented too, looking stunned.\u00a0\u201cUncle Yong, don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s a master of the zither on board too?\u201d\u201cThe one playing the zither just now is most likely the number one songstress of the Roving City of Commerce\u2019s \u2018Garden of Blossoms\u2019, Cha Jin. They say she\u2019s peerlessly skilled on top of being a rare beauty. She\u2019s quite famous.\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s eyes filled with longing. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that a brothel could give rise to such a peerlessly talented beauty. I\u2019d love to go see her for myself!\u201dYuan Luoxi snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s just a singing courtesan. Even if she were prettier, and even if her music were lovelier, she\u2019d still be nothing but a toy for men to drool over.\u201dHer voice was rife with disdain.What\u2019s she talking about?\u00a0Can\u2019t she tell from Cheng Wuyong\u2019s description that Miss Cha Jin sells her artistic talent, not her body?\u00a0She\u2019s a peerless beauty who remains pure even when surrounded by filth. Isn\u2019t it natural that men would admire and covet her?Although Huang Qianjun wanted to argue, Yuan Luoxi\u2019s status was far loftier than his, so he could only force his words back down.Suddenly, Su Yi spoke up out of nowhere. \u201cThere\u2019s something fishy about Cha Jin. If you run into her down the line, you\u2019d all best keep your distance.\u201dIt was just two sentences, but they left the entire group stunned.\u201cMaster Su, did you notice something amiss?\u201d asked Cheng Wuyong gravely.\u201cI can\u2019t be certain yet, but it has nothing to do with us, so no need to give this matter any further heed.\u201d Su Yi rose. \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. Where can we find something to eat?\u201dCheng Wuyong hurried to his feet. \u201cMaster Su, I\u2019ve already arranged a banquet. There\u2019s a spacious terrace on the ninth floor of the main tower. We can eat and drink with a full view of both banks of the Great Azure. The scenery is remarkable.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go right now.\u201d Yuan Luoxi got up, and the entire group left the pavilion. Cheng Wuyong led the way to the ninth floor.Meanwhile, two beautiful maids were escorting the youth in the purple robes and feathered headdress out of the third pavilion.\u201cTell Miss Cha Jin that I\u2019ll be back tomorrow,\u201d he ordered, then turned to leave. It sounded as if he\u2019d yet to get his fill.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d On his way back, the middle-aged Zhang Duo rushed over and whispered, \u201cI already asked about that group you sent me to investigate. One of them is Yuan Luoxi from the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital. She\u2019s\u2026.Zhang Duo hurriedly explained Yuan Luoxi and Cheng Wuyong\u2019s origins, touching on all key points.As for Su Yi and Huang Qianjun, he only mentioned them in passing.The purple-robed youth nodded. \u201cI see. If they\u2019re from the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2019s Yuan Family, there\u2019s no need to worry about them. Come on, let\u2019s go eat.\u201dWith that, he walked right off into the distance.When they reached the open terrace, numerous people had already gathered there, all of them clustered in groups, chatting as they dined.There was a sumptuous array of dishes, most of them delicacies of the mountains and rivers. The wine was aged, and the serving girls were pretty as butterflies flitting through fields of flowers.As night fell, the staff lit torches around the terrace, the firelight swaying as the stars sparkled overhead. The faint sound of the currents emanated from the waters of the Great Azure. The venue was elegant and soothing.Of course, those who could dine on the ninth floor\u2019s terrace were all either rich or members of the nobility.\u201cOh? They\u2019re here too.\u201d As soon as the purple-robed youth arrived, he saw Yuan Luoxi and her group seated near the rail.The torchlight only offset her valiant beauty, making the already heroic-looking young woman seem even prettier.\u201cYour Highness, our seats are over there.\u201d Zhang Duo was about to lead the way when the young man shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m going\u00a0to go pay\u00a0Miss Yuan a quick visit.\u201d With that, he quickened his footsteps and sped off.Zhang Duo froze, stunned, but when he saw Yuan Luoxi\u2019s bright, beautiful face, he instantly understood.He laughed bitterly, but he\u2019d long since grown accustomed to this, so he hurried after his master.Su Yi and company were enjoying their food and drink when the purple-robed youth in the feathered headdress first appeared on the terrace. Cheng Wuyong noticed him immediately, then looked him over, a hint of surprise on his face.He hurriedly said, \u201cUnless my guess is mistaken, that youth over there is the ultra-VIP guest Zhang Yiren spoke of.\u201dYuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cUncle Yong, how can you tell?\u201d\u201cThose purple robes of his are made of woven Snowspirit Silk, which is invulnerable to both water and flame. That feather headdress has a hint of spirituality; it\u2019s obviously no common item. His belt, boots, jade pendant.... Every last one is exquisitely crafted. His outfit alone had to cost at least five hundred spirit stones!Cheng Wuyong lowered his voice and continued, \u201cMore importantly, his attendant is a late-stage Qi Accumulation expert, and although he looks outwardly ordinary, he can\u2019t hide his aura from me; one look and I know he\u2019s an experienced killer.\u201dYuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.Even Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but re-evaluate Cheng Wuyong.\u00a0I didn\u2019t realize he was so perceptive. He\u2019s got good senses.Alas, he\u2019s overlooked the most important point.There was a barely perceptible trace of a spiritual imprint within the purple-robed youth\u2019s aura. It was reminiscent of the marks left by various soul techniques.There was no doubt about it: someone proficient in soul-based secret arts had set their sights on the purple-robed youth!But Su Yi didn\u2019t point it out.They were merely passersby; there was no need to go out of his way to warn the young man.But to Su Yi\u2019s surprise, he then saw the young man in purple walk right towards them.\u201cMiss Yuan, would you mind if I joined you?\u201d The youth walked right up to Yuan Luoxi, smiled personably, and cupped his fist.\u201cYou recognize me?\u201d Yuan Luoxi was surprised, but also confused.\u201cYou\u2019re the pearl of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2019s Yuan Family. How could I not know you?\u201d Even as he said this, the youth had already taken a seat, a broad smile on his face. \u201cEveryone, please forgive me for showing up uninvited. The road is lonely; I just hope to meet a few new friends.\u201dHuang Qianjun almost rolled his eyes. There was no way he\u2019d miss that this stranger was here for Yuan Luoxi!But when he saw Zhang Duo standing silently nearby, his heart filled with awe.Thanks to Cheng Wuyong\u2019s forewarning, Yuan Luoxi was aware of the youth\u2019s presumed extraordinary background, so she forced down her displeasure instead of sending him packing.As for Su Yi, he merely glanced at the youth, then looked away, returning his attention to his meal.The way he saw it, the purple-robed youth was trouble. It was better to keep his distance and avoid bringing trouble upon himself.\u201cMiss Yuan, are you planning to return to the Prefectural Capital?\u201d The purple-robed youth poured himself a glass of wine and flashed a winsome smile as warm as a spring breeze. He was easy to like.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Yuan Luoxi, then asked him right back, \u201cYou know who I am, so why haven\u2019t you introduced yourself? That\u2019s a bit rude, you know.\u201dThe purple-robed youth froze, then clasped his fist and smiled. \u201cI was negligent. My name is Zhili, and I\u2019m from the Jade Capital. I\u2019m headed to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital too.\u201dHuang Qianjun interjected, \u201cYoung Lord Zhili, might I be so bold as to ask what you\u2019re visiting the prefectural capital for?\u201dThe purple-robed youth smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019m visiting a few friends.\u201dWith that, he changed the subject and began chatting up Yuan Luoxi.There was no denying it: the purple-robed youth was a smooth-talker, but he was modest and unassuming, too. Combined with his handsome looks, most other girls would likely have taken a shine to him already.But Yuan Luoxi was merely irritated. She didn\u2019t like idle small talk with strangers.Especially when she sensed that the other party was interested in her. This only increased her aversion.If not for the fact that she didn\u2019t know his origins, she likely would have lost her temper by now.When he saw that Yuan Luoxi\u2019s replies were merely perfunctory, the purple-robed youth took the hint and backed off before pushing his luck.He seemed to realize that he couldn\u2019t come across as overly zealous during their first meeting.He rose, then clasped his fist. \u201cEveryone, please carry on. I should be on my way.\u201d\u201cRight, Miss Yuan, during my trip to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, it\u2019s possible I\u2019ll pay your family a visit. Don\u2019t be too surprised to see me!\u201dWith one last dashing smile, he turned and was about to leave\u2026But it was then that\u2014The massive tower ship beneath them trembled, as if it had crashed into a coral reef. All several hundred feet of it shook back and forth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Fortune and Disaster Are Things We Bring Upon OurselvesAs the tower ship shook back and forth, the tables and chairs on the ninth-floor terrace toppled, scattering food and wine. Countless cups and plates shattered audibly on impact, one after another.Startled cries soon followed.\u201cHurry up and hide!\u201d\u201cDammit, what\u2019s happening?\u201dEveryone shot to their feet and scattered, throwing the entire venue into chaos.Practically the instant the massive vessel first shook, Zhang Duo leaped to the purple-robed youth\u2019s side, nimble as a civet, and stood protectively in front of him. His gaze swept across the surrounding area, his eyes overflowing with sharp light.Su Yi and his companions rose as well, then steadied themselves. When they saw what was happening, they couldn\u2019t help but frown.What\u2019s going on?It was already dark out, and from their position on the ninth floor terrace, they couldn\u2019t tell what the tower ship had collided with.\u201cRoar~!\u201dSuddenly, the roars of spirit beasts filled the air, one after another, the sound filled with ferocity.Immediately afterward, a series of startled cries rose from the first five floors.\u201cThis is bad! All the captive spirit beasts have escaped! Hurry up and run!\u201d\u201cThe spirit beasts we had in captivity have all escaped!\u201d\u201c%@$&*! Who opened all those cages?\u201dTheir shouts mixed with the roars, reverberating throughout the night sky.From time to time, someone let out a piteous shriek; it seemed some of the guests were under attack!When they saw this, everyone on the terrace panicked. All of them were at a loss.They were well aware that the ship currently housed a full eight hundred captive spirit beasts!Just the thought of so many escaped beasts was enough to cause a mental breakdown.\u201cWhy would something like this happen all of a sudden\u2026.?\u201d Yuan Luoxi\u2019s pretty face was utterly graveCheng Wuyong said in a low voice, \u201cMiss, please relax. Given the power of Zhang Yiren and his subordinates, dealing with a handful of beasts won\u2019t be difficult.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid this incident won\u2019t be as simple as a few spirit beasts running rampant.\u201d Huang Qianjun sighed.Someone ill-intentioned had obviously opened the beasts\u2019 cages on purpose!Su Yi brushed his fingers along his bamboo staff, then glanced at the panicked guests, his expression just as calm as before. He said nothing.It was then that the purple-robed youth strode over to Yuan Luoxi and comforted her with a smile. He seemed perfectly composed. \u201cMiss Yuan, please rest at ease. I\u2019m here, and I won\u2019t let any harm befall you!\u201dThat guy sure can talk!\u00a0Huang Qianjun sneered inwardly.Yuan Luoxi furrowed her willowy brows. \u201cThanks, but the way I see it, you ought to worry about protecting yourself first.\u201dThe youth shot her another dashing grin. \u201cOver the past year, I\u2019ve overcome countless dangers. What does a minor incident like this amount to?\u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive my immodesty, if even I cannot resolve this crisis, I\u2019m afraid no one on board will escape calamity.\u201dHe said this, then smiled. \u201cOf course, nothing of the sort will happen.\u201dHuang Qianjun froze. A moment passed before he understood the young nobleman\u2019s implications. He couldn\u2019t help but find it funny.\u00a0Is he saying he\u2019s the strongest person on board this ship?He couldn\u2019t help but glance at Su Yi, only to find that Su Yi seemed as composed as ever, as if he hadn\u2019t even heard what the purple-robed youth was saying.Huang Qianjun thought to himself,\u00a0Look! That\u2019s Brother Su for you! He can\u2019t even be bothered to pay attention to you!It was then that the group\u2019s keen senses alerted them to the fact that, although the ship was no longer shaking, it had stopped firmly in place.But the nonstop roars of the spirit beasts still rumbled like thunder, filling the night skies and mixing with the screams of passengers scattered throughout the ship.Everyone\u2019s expressions were solemn. Fortunately, this was the ninth-floor terrace. No beasts would show up here. At least, not for a while.Suddenly, a man in warrior robes charged onto the platform. He rushed up to the purple-robed youth and whispered something in his ear.The youth immediately gave his orders. \u201cTell them they needn\u2019t worry about my safety. Once you reconvene with them, go help Zhang Yiren slay the spirit beasts. Get this situation under control as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The man in warrior\u2019s robes cupped his fists, then left.That\u2019s another late-stage Qi Accumulation tough customer!\u00a0Cheng Wuyong\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.The purple-robed youth then smiled at Yuan Luoxi. \u201cMy subordinate just reported that someone deliberately unlatched the spirit beasts\u2019 cages, and that Zhang Yiren is currently leading his subordinates into the fray. I\u2019ve already sent my own men to help out. I trust that before long, we\u2019ll resolve this incident.\u201dHis words were smooth and self-confident.But it was then that Su Yi suddenly spoke up. \u201cWe should leave.\u201dBefore the words even left his lips, he turned and walked away.He\u2019s leaving? At a time like this?\u00a0Yuan Luoxi, Huang Qianjun, and Cheng Wuyong were stunned, but despite their confusion, they hurriedly followed him.The purple-robed youth\u2019s eyes went blank, and he felt a hint of displeasure. He\u2019d planned to seize this opportunity to chat up Yuan Luoxi. Who\u2019d have thought Su Yi would leave just like that?If he wants to leave, so be it. But why does he have to take Yuan Luoxi and the others with him?\u00a0This was an affront to the youth\u2019s dignity. He couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cYao are currently attacking the ship, yet you want to leave? How stupid are you!? If you want to throw your life away, fine, but don\u2019t drag others down with you! How selfish can you be?\u201dWhen he lost his temper, he emanated the air of one long accustomed to power.He\u2019d already learned Su Yi\u2019s background from his guards; he knew that Su Yi was nothing but a live-in son-in-law from a backwater like Guangling City, and furthermore, that he was only in the Blood Circulation Realm.The only praiseworthy thing about him was that a few days ago, Su Yi had taken the top spot in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet.But in the eyes of a lofty noble like the purple-robed youth, a minor accomplishment like that wasn\u2019t worthy of notice.That was why he dared openly rebuke Su Yi.Su Yi\u2019s companions\u2019 expressions shifted, but Su Yi himself merely responded coolly, \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive my bluntness, we\u2019ll be in more danger if we stay here with you. You\u2019ve perhaps already guessed why this incident happened tonight.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d The purple-robed youth\u2019s expression darkened, and his eyes flashed with cold light, but Su Yi\u2019s words were right on the mark.Su Yi\u2019s companions couldn\u2019t help but start.\u00a0Did Master Su sense something?\u201cFortune and disaster aren\u2019t up to destiny; people bring their fates onto themselves. You\u2019d best watch out. Good luck.\u201dSu Yi shook his head, lifted his foot, and was just about to leave when Zhang Duo blocked his path. He glared coldly and said, \u201cYoung man, it won\u2019t be too late to leave\u00a0after\u00a0you\u2019ve explained yourself!\u201dHis words carried an unconcealed threat.Cheng Wuyong instantly stood and growled, \u201cFriend, that was but a minor verbal disagreement. What need is there to threaten others? Let\u2019s all step back, shall we? No need to take this too far!\u201dZhang Duo ignored him, looking instead at the youth in purple.The youth was already angry. He glared at Su Yi, saying, \u201cIt was out of respect for Miss Yuan that I even bothered trying to stop you. Since you insist on throwing your life away, fine. Go right ahead. But don\u2019t drag the others down with you!\u201d\u201cIf we want to \u2018throw our lives away\u2019, what does that have to do with you?\u201d Huang Qianjun laughed coldly.\u201cImpudent!\u201d Zhang Duo\u2019s expression darkened, and he was just about to say something when the youth in purple waved impatiently.\u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cLet them go. I\u2019ve never seen such a willfully ignorant group before!\u201dHe then turned to Yuan Luoxi and said with the utmost confidence, \u201cMiss Yuan, please relax. I guarantee you\u2019re safest right here with me!\u201dBut Yuan Luoxi merely shook her head. \u201cNo, I want to stay with Master Su.\u201dShe paused, then added, \u201cYoung Master Zhili, I\u2019ve experienced something like this before too, so I urge you to calm down and consider why Master Su said what he did; don\u2019t just get angry for no reason. Rage will only lead to errors in your judgment.\u201dShe sounded sincere, and she was. Every word came straight from the heart; she\u2019d learned this lesson the hard way.But the purple-robed youth froze; he almost didn\u2019t believe his ears. A sense of utter absurdity filled his heart.The glorious daughter of the Yuan Family would rather throw her life away alongside some Blood Circulation Realm youth than trust my words?And she even\u2026. She even urged me to cool my head and consider \u2018Master Su\u2019s\u2019 words\u2026.?The youth\u2019s anger was so overwhelming that he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Given his lofty status, no one had ever lectured him like this before.What angered him the most was that the one lecturing him was a girl he rather admired!In the end, his spirits sank, and he sighed. \u201cAnd here I thought you were different from other people. Who\u2019d have thought you were so shortsighted? Fine. All of you can leave.\u201dHe suddenly felt alone, as if no one understood him.The people of Cloudriver Prefecture, even the pearl of the Yuan Family, had limited perspectives. Their world was too small; they couldn\u2019t grasp just how lofty the person they now faced really was!He was willing to offer them his protection, something others could only dream of. The funny part was, they didn\u2019t even realize it\u2026How foolish!But if they wanted to throw their lives away, he\u2019d let them.As he thought this, the youth\u2019s temper fizzled out.Su Yi had no idea how many emotional changes the youth underwent in that short period of time.But even if he had known, he wouldn\u2019t have cared in the least.Because in his eyes, the youth with a spiritual brand on his soul was\u00a0trouble. The loftier his status, the more trouble he\u2019d bring!But just as they neared the stairs, someone blocked their path.\u201cEveryone, please do as we say and go back. Or else, don\u2019t blame us for our poor manners.\u201d The speaker was a middle-aged man dressed like a scholar. It was unclear when he\u2019d arrived, but he was already standing in the shadowed stairwell.His cheekbones were gaunt, his eyes sunken and flashing with sharp light. His right hand hovered over the hilt of the sword strapped to his waist, and his aura was cold and sinister as winter gales.Several others stood behind him, blocking the way down. There were over a dozen of them, all of them emanating murderous intent and fierce bloodlust.When Su Yi saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cWe were one step too late. It seems we can\u2019t count on Zhang Yiren to stabilize the beasts\u2019 rampage anytime soon.\u201dYuan Luoxi, Cheng Wuyong, and Huang Qianjun\u2019s hearts sank. All of them sensed that something was amiss.It seemed tonight\u2019s incident wasn\u2019t as simple as a mere beast rampage. They also had to contend with the ill-intentioned scoundrels planning to take advantage of the chaos!\u201cMaster Su, what do you\u2026.\u201d Yuan Luoxi was just about to ask if they should force their way through or not when Su Yi shook his head.\u201cLet\u2019s go back. Given the current situation, it doesn\u2019t matter where we go. Trouble is sure to come knocking at our door, so we might as well just bide our time and see what happens.\u201dAs he spoke, he turned and went back, and his companions followed.The middle-aged scholar was stunned; he seemed surprised at Su Yi\u2019s obedience. He snorted and shook his head.\u00a0And here I thought they were tough. Turns out they\u2019re nothing but cowards!When he saw Su Yi\u2019s group making their way back, the youth in purple was stunned too. Then, a hint of a cold smile tugged at his lips, and his eyes shone with amusement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - A Body Like Water and Clouds, the Charm of the MistsThe purple-robed youth felt the urge to jeer, but out of consideration for his bearing and propriety, he simply smiled faintly, put on an air of magnanimity, and went up to greet them. \u201cSu Yi, the wise know when to go with the flow. I\u2019m pleased that you realized your mistakes and decided to return. I won\u2019t linger on that earlier unpleasantness, so you shouldn\u2019t take it to heart either.\u201dYuan Luoxi and the others were stunned, and their expressions went a bit strange.\u00a0Why does this guy think so highly of himself?Su Yi pointed to the stairwell. \u201cTrouble has already come knocking. Young Master Zhili, you\u2019d best be careful.\u201dWIth that, he returned to his chair by the railing, gazed at the distant river shrouded in darkness, and sank into thought.He feared tonight wouldn\u2019t be peaceful.Trouble?\u00a0The purple-robed youth frowned, then glanced at Zhang Duo. \u201cGo take a look.\u201d\u201cYour High\u2014.... Please be careful sir.\u201d Zhang Duo hesitated, then leaped into action.The youth then turned his gentle gaze toward Yuan Luoxi. \u201cMiss Yuan, I said it earlier: so long as I\u2019m around, this is the safest place on the entire tower ship!\u201dBut how could she possibly be in the mood to waste words with him?Just as she was about to leave, a woman carrying a swaddled infant hurried over, her words flowing out in a panic.\u201cI have to go downstairs! My husband is on the eighth floor\u2026.\u201dThe purple-robed youth frowned, then went up to stop her. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous downstairs. Listen to me: you and your child will be safest if you remain here.\u201dThe woman had kept her head lowered this entire time, but she suddenly looked up, a hint of a cold smile on her lips. \u201cThat so?\u201dAs she spoke, a dagger emerged from the bundle she clutched to her chest. She grabbed it by the hilt and viciously stabbed the youth right in the stomach.She was unquestionably an experienced assassin. Her disguise was on point, but more than that, her movements and bearing were no different from an ordinary woman\u2019s.Yet when she struck, she was fast, arrogant, and ruthless!The purple-robed youth bent at the waist and clutched his side, staggering backward. Shock and bewilderment were written all over his face.\u201cYou\u2019re seeking death!\u201d Cheng Wuyong wasn\u2019t far away, and when he realized what was happening, his eyes glinted. He swung at the woman, but her nimbleness far exceeded his expectations. She dodged, reappearing nearby.She\u2019d tossed the \u201cswaddled infant\u201d she\u2019d used to disguise herself away, but she didn\u2019t look happy; on the contrary, her expression was grave and unsightly.\u201cYoung Master Zhili, are you alright?\u201d asked Cheng Wuyong gravely.Huang Qianjun and Yuan Luoxi had only just realized what had happened, and they broke out in cold sweats.Neither of them had sensed the woman\u2019s assassination attempt!Su Yi sat not far away, minding his own business. He merely glanced at the woman, then looked away.The woman had seized the perfect opportunity to make her assassination attempt; she timed it for just after Zhang Duo left his master\u2019s side.Without Zhang Duo to protect him, there was nothing the youth could do to stop such an assassination attempt.Unfortunately for her, the woman still failed.It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t capable enough. Her dagger was just too low quality\u2026\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said the young man in purple. His brow was covered in sweat, but he was alive and well. \u201cWith the Golden Nephrite Rainbow Armor to protect me, even ordinary spiritual weapons can\u2019t hurt me.\u201dAnd indeed, when the crowd looked over, they saw that although the dagger had torn through the youth\u2019s clothes, he wasn\u2019t injured, and there was no trace of blood.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Zhang Duo dashed over like a gust of wind, shock, rage, and concern written all over his face.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The purple-robed youth took a deep breath, and his expression darkened. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t have thought that would-be murderers lurked on the ninth-floor terrace!\u201dHe turned his gaze towards the woman, icy and intimidating.Against all expectations, the woman didn\u2019t shrink back or flee. She merely crossed her arms and sighed. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t have guessed the Sixth Highness had spiritual artifact flexible\u00a0armor on under\u00a0those robes.\u201dMany of those nearby retreated in panic; this scene left all of them too startled to draw near.\u201c\u2018Sixth Highness\u2019? You\u2026. You\u2019re\u2026..\u201d Yuan Luoxi clasped her hand to her lips, and her beautiful eyes widened.The Sixth Highness!This was a title reserved for either kings hailing from the imperial family, the emperor\u2019s brothers, or the current emperor\u2019s direct descendants!Judging from the purple-robed youth\u2019s age, he was most likely the latter!Huang Qianjun went rigid, and his eyes widened in disbelief.\u00a0That braggart is actually an imperial prince!?Even Cheng Wuyong\u2019s expression changed as waves of shock coursed through his heart.The Cloudriver Prefecture was one of the six prefectures of the Imperatorial Province. It was in the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s southwestern territory, far removed from the Jade Capital at the heart of the Sky Province.From their perspective, Yujing, the Jade Capital, was far, far away.But now, a prince of the imperial family was standing right in front of them. It was easy to imagine the extent of their shock.\u201cHe really is trouble. Big trouble.\u201d Su Yi furrowed his brow.Whoever these people were, they dared assassinate a prince of the imperial family. It was easy to imagine just how great a storm this incident would stir up!And it was highly likely that they\u2019d all get dragged into this mess through no fault of their own.But before long, Su Yi\u2019s brow relaxed. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to worry about this.If trouble came knocking at his door, he\u2019d just swing his sword around and be done with it.\u201cEveryone, I apologize for hiding my status earlier, but this expedition was supposed to remain a secret. Who\u2019d have thought these crooks would set their sights on me anyway?\u201dThe youth grimaced, but the way Yuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun looked at him had clearly already changed. They dared not be as\u00a0impudent\u00a0as before.Su Yi noticed this, but said nothing.At the end of the day, this was the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s territory. Everything was subject to imperial authority. Never mind Yuan Luoxi and the others; even Martial Dao Grandmasters would have to be respectful.Thud thud thud!Footsteps rang out, and a group emerged from the stairwell.The leader was the same scholarly middle-aged man who\u2019d blocked Su Yi\u2019s path earlier.A group of black-robed, masked figures followed him. Only their eyes were visible, but they looked strong, and all of them emanated vicious murderous intent.\u201cWe must have startled you, Sixth Highness.\u201d The middle-aged scholar approached with a smile. \u201cZhang Yiren and his subordinates are busy fighting for their lives; they have no time to spare worrying about others. Our people are restricting those three subordinates of yours too. I\u2019m afraid only Zhang Duo is left to protect you.\u201dHe paused, then continued, \u201cSixth Highness, if you know what\u2019s good for you, please hand it over. I guarantee that if you do, we\u2019ll turn and leave here and now.\u201d\u201cWho sent you?\u201d The purple-robed youth asked, his expression cold as ice.The scholarly middle-aged man sighed. \u201cTo tell the truth, I\u2019m wondering the same thing. Just who spent such a vast sum to hire us? It was too tempting an offer to resist despite knowing capture might very mean death for our entire families. We would never have agreed to such a dangerous undertaking otherwise.\u201d\u201cSomeone hired you?\u201d The purple-robed youth\u2019s brow knit together. \u201cHow much did they spend? I can give you double. All you have to do is leave right now. If you do, I swear on my name that I won\u2019t pursue this matter.\u201dThe middle-aged scholar laughed and shook his head. \u201cSixth Highness, no need to stall for time. I\u2019ll count to three. If you don\u2019t hand it over, don\u2019t blame me for my poor manners.\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d He extended a finger, his expression calm.The men in black behind him clenched their weapons, ready to strike. Tension filled the air, so thick, you could cut it with a knife.\u201cIs there really no room to negotiate?\u201d The purple-robed youth frowned, but although his expression was unsightly, he wasn\u2019t panicking.The middle-aged man didn\u2019t even dignify this with a response. His lips parted, and he said, \u201cTwo.\u201dBy now, Yuan Luoxi, Huang Qianjun, and Cheng Wuyong felt the tension too. They inwardly cried out.If possible, I would have preferred not to have learned that purple-robed youth\u2019s true identity.This is just great. If something happens to His Sixth Highness, how can we just stand back and watch?If the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s imperial family blamed them for their inaction, it would inevitably implicate their families and factions too!Master Su was right,\u00a0Yuan Luoxi sighed to herself.\u00a0This guy is a walking disaster.\u00a0The most dangerous part of the ship is whatever part he\u2019s in!But for some reason, when she saw Su Yi sitting comfortably and at ease not far away, she felt reassured.\u00a0With Master Su here, what\u2019s there to be afraid of?As she thought this, Yuan Luoxi adjusted her posture, standing more upright than before.Meanwhile, before the middle-aged man could say \u201cthree\u201d, the purple-robed youth shouted, \u201cMartial Aunt Qing Jin, if you wait any longer, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m really done for!\u201dHis voice boomed throughout the darkness.Everyone was stunned.Immediately afterward, a lazy, yet uniquely magnetic feminine voice rang out. \u201cHmph! What are you carrying on about? The fighting hasn\u2019t started yet, has it?\u201dA flash of movement accompanied her voice, and before the crowd knew what was happening, a slender figure stood before them.Her eyes were bright and sharp as knives, and her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, revealing her exquisitely beautiful face.Her fair skin was as smooth and unblemished as porcelain, and her simple white clothes did little to obscure her winsome figure. The fabric nevertheless outlined her shocking curves.She carried a jade circlet in one hand, a pot of wine in the other as she slumped lazily. Her bearing was rather unique, but she had quite the presence.The crowd\u2019s gazes converged on her. Most had never seen someone so stunning.Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cWhat a pretty big sister!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got good taste!\u201d Qing Jin gave her a thumbs up, her full red lips curving into an intoxicating smile.In a rare display of bashfulness, Yuan Luoxi blushed, then averted her gaze, not daring to meet Qing Jin\u2019s eyes.Huang Qianjun\u2019s heart pounded in his chest.\u00a0This woman is monstrous\u2026.. How could any ordinary man withstand her charms!?Even Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but take a second glance at Qing Jin. He was a bit stunned.\u00a0A body of water and cloud with the mysterious charm of the mist. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the Great Zhou was home to a natural-born Spiritmist Jade Physique. It\u2019s included in \u2018the Heavens\u2019 Guide to Spiritual Physiques\u2019, although admittedly only in the low eighth-tier. Still, for a mundane nation like this, that\u2019s already quite rareNumerous exceptional spiritual physiques existed in this world, and their owners typically blossomed into talents whose radiance far exceeded their peers.The strongest such physiques included the Nine Yang Solar Physique, the Five Elements Physique, Sword Bone Spirit Embryos, Lightning War Physiques, among others. All were heaven-defying existence.Even in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, they were as rare as qilin horns and phoenix feathers. Ten thousand years might pass without a single such individual appearing.But the girl the purple-robed youth had just called \u201cMartial Aunt Qing Jin\u201d had a natural Spiritmist Jade Physique!This spiritual physique was as soft and ethereal as the clouds, with a spirituality as pure as mist. Talent like this was enough to warrant calling her a \u201clittle monster\u201d!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Twin Scarlet MoonbladesAt the same time, Su Yi noticed that as powerful as Qing Jin\u2019s aura was, she was still only in the early stages of the Qi Accumulation Realm.\u00a0It\u2019s no wonder Cheng Wuyong mistook her for a seventeen-year-old Martial Dao Grandmaster. With a spiritual physique of that level, the realms of mundane martial artists are insufficient to describe her.Of course, with the power of her spiritual physique, she unquestionably far surpassed mundane martial artists of the same cultivation!When Qing Jin stepped onto the battlefield, the scholar and his followers\u2019 expressions turned grim.But then, the woman who\u2019d just tried and failed to kill the purple-robed youth laughed coldly, \u201cSixth Highness, do you really think we\u2019d carry out this operation without taking into account the most threatening member of your party?\u201dAs she said this, she gazed into the crowd of guests who\u2019d long since fled to the far end of the terrace. \u201cSenior, please strike!\u201dEveryone instinctively glanced over.Off in the distance, there was a disturbance among the crowd, and they quickly cleared a path. The only one who didn\u2019t move was a man in hemp clothes.His complexion was dark, and his temples were starting to gray. He carried a four-foot cloth bag on his back, but his appearance wasn\u2019t otherwise noteworthy.When he sensed that everyone was looking at him, the man frowned, let out a long sigh, then approached with large strides.Thud! Thud! Thud!\u00a0With each footstep, the thick wooden deck shook, and his aura rose another level.\u00a0Beneath the crowd\u2019s transfixed gazes, the man seemed to transform into a mountain. Even as he walked, he seemed towering and steady, and he emanated a suffocating pressure.\u201cA Grandmaster!\u201d Cheng Wuyong\u2019s expression turned unsightly.While they were dining here just a few minutes ago, he shockingly failed to sense the Martial Dao Grandmaster mixed into the crowd!No, that\u2019s not it. Earlier, Master Su suggested that we leave this place. I\u2019m afraid he realized a long time ago that trouble lurked on the ninth-floor terrace too.He couldn\u2019t help but glance at Su Yi again, but Su Yi looked as composed as ever.At the same time, Su Yi\u2019s voice echoed through Cheng Wuyong\u2019s ears. \u201cIf we really can\u2019t avoid trouble, all you have to do is protect your family\u2019s young miss and Huang Qianjun.\u201dCheng Wuyong\u2019s heart shook, but he instantly relaxed.\u201cA Grandmaster!\u201d Yuan Luoxi, Huang Qianjun, and the other guests only just reacted. Without exception, their expressions changed, and they felt a chill reach all the way to their extremities.Upon becoming a Grandmaster, a martial artist was like a soaring dragon!Within the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s borders, only factions with a Grandmaster to hold down the fort were considered \u2018major.\u2019Even if you searched all nineteen cities of Cloudriver Prefecture, you\u2019d find\u00a0but\u00a0a handful of Martial Dao Grandmasters.Yet now, a Grandmaster had appeared on the ninth-floor terrace, right in front of them.\u201cThey sure went all out!\u201d The purple-robed youth\u2019s expression changed, and his eyes blazed with fury.They\u2019d actually sent a Grandmaster to assassinate him! It was clear how poisonous the other party\u2019s heart was and how determined they were to end him!\u201cI knew it would be like this.\u201d Qing Jin whipped around, her knifelike eyes boring into the man in hemp clothes.She sneered, her disdain readily apparent on her beautiful face. \u201cA Grandmaster is as lofty as the sun. They should be open and candid as they gaze down upon the masses. But look at you, hiding in the crowd with your tail between your legs. You\u2019re only just showing your face now? You might have a Grandmaster\u2019s cultivation, but you sure aren\u2019t worthy of a Grandmaster\u2019s reputation.\u201dHer words were utterly domineering.The crowd\u2019s expressions shifted, but the hemp-clad man looked as staunch and unmoving as a boulder. He said flatly, \u201cDragons are ever-changing and adaptable. They can be large enough to stir up winds and clouds or small enough to hide in the most minute of crevasses. The same applies to the Grandmasters of the world: we come in all stripes. Miss, your sweeping generalizations have blinded you to the greater picture.\u201dThe night was dark and somber. The air was rife with tension, and a storm was imminent.\u201cA dragon? Hah? That\u2019s a word mundane martial artists use to compliment others. Describing yourself as a dragon is a bit much. Ridiculous!\u201d Qing Jin made no effort to hide her disdain. She was stunning, beautiful, and forceful.She tossed her pot of wine, which landed steadily on a table. Then, she raised her thin, jade-like finger and rubbed the jade circlet on her left wrist.Sparks flew.Clang! Clang!When the noise and sparks faded, she held a pair of sabers, one in each hand.The sabers were curved like crescent moons, and dense but faint spiritual firelight glowed along the blades. When she held them both, it looked as if she were gripping a pair of crescent red moons!The Twin Scarlet Moonblades!\u201cOn a night like this, decapitating a Grandmaster before having my drink actually sounds rather pleasant.\u201dHer voice was lazy and magnetic, and her clothes swayed as she moved. Those slender curves were now shockingly imposing.Her twin sabers buzzed, clear and melodious.Everyone held their breath. They felt something prick at their skin, as if sharp knives were pressed against their throats; it was suddenly difficult to even breathe.Even Cheng Wuyong and Zhang Duo, Qi Accumulation experts, tensed up as waves of pressure slammed them right in the face.Suddenly, Qing Jin charged, her hair flying into the air.Whoosh!She was so fast, she left an afterimage in her wake. Her sabers crossed, and she attacked mid-charge.It was as if a pair of scarlet crimson moons had slashed through the night sky. Their radiance stung the eyes, their glow illusory and ethereal as it descended into the mundane world.Flowing Scarlet Arcs!This was an upper earth-grade secret technique, and she\u2019d already achieved proficiency in it. When she unleashed it, she fully realized its subtle mysteries.The man in hemp clothes narrowed his eyes, then reached behind him.The four-foot cloth strapped to his back burst into shreds of fabric, and a short black halberd appeared in his hand.Clang!!!An ear-splitting collision rang out, the sound piercing metal and shattering stone.The man in hemp clothes retreated several steps backward before finally stabilizing himself. His energy churned, and his short halberd buzzed and shook.When he looked at Qing Qin, he saw her standing tall and holding her twin sabers, their energy filling the air around her. Her bright eyes glinted like blades, beautiful but imposing.She\u2019s so strong!\u00a0Without exception, everyone who witnessed this was stunned.A Martial Dao Grandmaster, pushed back in a single attack!Before they fought, Qing Jin\u2019s appearance set her apart from the masses. If the terrace was a stage, she was the stylish, eye-catching lead actress.But when she attacked, she was sharp and despotic, attacking in a flash of arced light. She put many of the men present to shame; they could only sigh over their own inferiority.\u201cShe\u2019s amazing!\u201d Yuan Luoxi\u2019s eyes sparkled as she cried out in excitement.Clang!Qing Jin didn\u2019t pause her offensive. In combat, every inch of her billowed with grim murderous intent, her twin sabers filling the air with illusory red crescent moons, each swing faster and more despotic than the one before.They weren\u2019t just sharp; they were as domineering as a wildfire!Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!Saber clashed against\u00a0halberd\u00a0in rapid succession, like the beating of a drum. The sound echoed throughout the night sky, churning the blood and stinging the ears.The onlookers watched as fiery blade shadows intercrossed. Qing Jin perfectly resembled a bolt of lightning, fierce yet intangible.The man in hemp clothes was forced back several more times.But he was utterly terrifying too; he was steady as a mountain, with the force of a boulder. No matter how fierce the sharp storm of cuts was, it had yet to do him any real damage.Suddenly, his eyes crackled with electricity, and his voice boomed like thunder. \u201cFor someone of the Qi Accumulation Realm to possess such power is terrifying indeed, but alas, you are not fit to provoke a Grandmaster!\u201dBoom!He stomped against the deck, and his aura shot up another level. He suddenly swung his halberd.At that moment, it looked as if he were wielding a bolt of black lightning!Bang!They clashed, and Qing Jin froze in mid-air before hurtling backward.This attack had sent her flying!The entire terrace fell silent. Even the birds went quiet.Cheng Wuyong and Zhang Duo\u2019s expressions shifted.\u00a0This\u2026 This is the power of a Grandmaster!Meanwhile, those on the scholar\u2019s side inwardly sighed in relief.Just now, Qing Jin\u2019s offensive had been too powerful. Just watching made their hearts shake with terror and left them barely able to breathe.Fortunately for them, the tides were starting to turn in their favor!\u201cHmph. It seems that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. Time is precious, so I\u2019ll kill you now!\u201d Qing Jin\u2019s bright eyes blazed with killing intent.She shot forth in a flash, sabers swinging.But this time, overflowing rosy light surged around her, as if she were the rising sun. Her glow was particularly dazzling against the night skies.Yet she simultaneously seemed more ethereal and indistinct, as if she were made of misty clouds.The true meaning of mist, a power that originates from her bloodline. It\u2019s this trump card that gives her the confidence to fight Inner Furnace Realm opponents.\u00a0Su Yi inwardly nodded. He\u2019d anticipated this development.But didn\u2019t her foes have trump cards of their own?After all, they were here to assassinate an imperial prince, and it was obvious that they\u2019d been preparing for this for quite some time. They had to have more up their sleeves than a single Martial Dao Grandmaster.Clang!As Su Yi pondered, the battle erupted once more.After unleashing the power of her innate talent, the true meaning of mist, Qing Jin\u2019s power noticeably went up a level. As she fought the enemy Grandmaster, she didn\u2019t just hold her own; she even had a slight advantage.Their fight drew every eye on the terrace. Everyone watched nervously.A moment later\u2014Traces of blood trickled from the corners of the Grandmaster\u2019s lips.This scene stunned everyone present. He was a Martial Dao Grandmaster, yet he\u2019d suffered internal injuries in battle!But against all expectations, the man in hemp clothes showed no signs of anger or surprise. Instead, he let out a long sigh. \u201cFine. I agreed to this operation. Why cling to life any further?\u201dHis voice was melancholy, but as he spoke, his energy seemed to boil like wave-tossed seas. A destructive aura then spread throughout the terrace.\u201cA secret art at the expense of your own life?\u201d Qing Jin\u2019s beautiful brow furrowed, her pretty face suddenly solemn. She attacked with all her might, the Twin Scarlet Moonblades striking like a rain of shooting stars.Clang!But after the next startling impact rang out, it was her slender figure that was sent staggering back. The blood drained from her face, and her bright eyes widened in disbelief.In contrast, the man in hemp clothes was like a raging, inextinguishable wildfire. He gripped his halberd and charged at Qing Jin with the intent to kill.He was like a demonic god!Boom!He waved his halberd, which flashed with bright light, striking like a sudden crack of thunder.Qing Jin gnashed her teeth, but she didn\u2019t dodge. She clashed with him head-on.Bang!She was sent flying once more, and she coughed up blood. Her beautiful face was now deathly pale, and her brow contorted in a rare display of shock and anger.Both the purple-clad youth and Su Yi\u2019s companions felt a chill, and their expressions shifted.The scholar and his followers looked on, murderous and ready to strike at any moment. They planned to seize this opportunity to capture tonight\u2019s main prey.The hemp-clad man\u2019s indifferent voice resounded throughout the battlefield as he attacked once more. \u201cA life for a life, a worthy sacrifice!\u201dClang!He raised his black short halberd, and a limitless flood of staunch baleful energy slashed towards her.There was nowhere for Qing Jin to run.His attack looked simple, but it covered all directions, like an inescapable net. Her only choice was to resist head-on.A hint of bitterness rose unbidden on her lips.\u00a0It seems I underestimated how terrifying Grandmasters are\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - You\u2019ll Do Anything?\u201cMartial Aunt!\u201d The purple-robed watched from a distance. He cried out, his heart on tenterhooks.The other onlookers paled too.Bang!In the face of imminent crisis, Qing Jin wasn\u2019t the least bit afraid. She resisted with all her might, only for her opponent\u2019s attack to send the Twin Scarlet Moonblades flying from her hands.She hurtled through the air too, landing several dozen feet away. She was now so pale, even her lips were white, and she repeatedly coughed up blood. Her bright eyes dimmed, and her breathing was shallow.\u201cYou actually survived?\u201d The man in hemp clothes furrowed his brow in surprise.\u201cSixth Highness, hurry up and leave while there\u2019s still breath in my body. I know you have other life-saving trump cards. When the time comes to use them, don\u2019t be stingy.\u201d\u00a0She coughed violently as she struggled to her feet, then glanced at the Twin Scarlet Moonblades, which had been flung far away. She looked frustrated and helpless.Then, she shook her head and took a deep breath. By the time she exhaled, her pallid face was completely tranquil. \u201cIf he can disregard his life, I can too!\u201dThe hemp-clothed man\u2019s pupils constricted in a rare display of hesitation.\u201cMartial Aunt, if we die, we die together!\u201d The youth in purple cried out, his eyes blazing with ruthless determination. \u201cWhen Imperial\u00a0Father finds out about this, all of them will pay with their lives!\u201dNot far away, the scholar and his companions\u2019 expressions shifted.\u201cI escorted you all the way here. How could I let you throw your life away? Hurry up and\u00a0scram!\u201d rebuked Qing Jin.\u201cWant to leave? Forget it! No one is leaving this place alive!\u201d said the scholarly middle-aged man grimly. \u201cSo long as all of you are dead, no one will ever discover our involvement!\u201dYuan Luoxi, Cheng Wuyong, and the other guests\u2019 hearts went cold.But it was then that an exasperated sigh rang out. \u201cSee? I told you this was going to be trouble.\u201dAs he spoke, Su Yi walked over from his spot by the railing, bamboo staff in hand, looking indifferent and detached.Everyone instinctively glanced toward him.His companions\u2019 eyes lit up with excitement.\u00a0Is Master Su finally going to intervene?When he saw that the speaker was the very youth he\u2019d intimidated back at the stairwell, the middle-aged scholar instantly burst into cold laughter. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, little guy. I\u2019ll guarantee I\u2019ll take your head off in a single swing and give you a painless death!\u201dThe nearby men in black burst into laughter.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d When he heard Su Yi\u2019s words, the purple-robed youth\u2019s face went ashen. \u201cYou still think me keeping you here brought you harm?:His expression was contorted and unsightly, his rage seemingly without limit.\u201cAre you saying it didn\u2019t?\u201d Su Yi fired right back. \u201cDespite knowing your own secrets\u00a0full well, you still chose to come here to indulge in revelry. How stupid are you? In doing so, you\u2019ve implicated everyone else here. How selfish can you be?\u201dThe youth in purple was so angry that he almost coughed up blood.Earlier, he rebuked Su Yi for his foolishness and stupidity. Who\u2019d have thought that now, Su Yi would rebuke him right back?\u201cLook! They\u2019ve started fighting amongst themselves! It sure is a dog-eat-dog world out there! Hahaha!\u201d The woman who\u2019d made the initial assasination attempt against the purple-robed youth burst into brazen laughter.Su Yi glanced at her indifferently. \u201cLet\u2019s hope you can still smile after this.\u201dAn inexplicable chill coursed through the woman\u2019s heart, and her laughter came to an abrupt halt. She was suddenly uncertain.\u00a0How can a mere Blood Circulation Realm youth have such a terrifying gaze?\u201cSixth Highness, only Master Su can save us now. I\u2019ll say it once more: don\u2019t let your anger muddle your judgment,\u201d Yuan Luoxi took a deep breath and said seriously.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that he\u2026. You\u2019re saying that\u00a0he\u00a0can save us?\u201d The purple-robed youth seemed a bit bewildered, as if he\u2019d just heard an enormous joke.\u201cMiss Yuan, I ask that you don\u2019t make jokes like that at times like this!\u201d Zhang Duo\u2019s expression was unsightly.Even someone as terrifying as Qing Jin was no match for that Martial Dao Grandmaster, much less a Blood Circulation Realm youth like Su Yi!The middle-aged scholar and his followers were briefly stunned. Then, all of them burst into laughter.The Grandmaster in hemp clothes shook his head. In his eyes, Su Yi was nothing but a dancing clown throwing his life away.If he weren\u2019t on guard against Qing Jin\u2019s last-ditch, life-and-death attack, he\u2019d have killed Su Yi already.Even Qing Jin couldn\u2019t help but lose her temper. She glared at Su Yi, then said mockingly, \u201cIf you can really save everyone here, I\u2019ll do anything you want! If not, pipe down and\u00a0scram!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d do \u2018anything\u2019 I want?\u201d Su Yi mulled it over, then said, \u201cI can just barely accept those conditions. Otherwise, helping a group of strangers resolve their troubles for nothing would leave a bad taste in my mouth.\u2019Qing Jin was stunned.\u00a0Is this kid insane?The hemp-clad man\u2019s eyes flashed. He seized Qing Jin\u2019s temporary distraction to swing his halberd with all his might.A Grandmaster\u2019s sudden attack. How terrifying was that?But then\u2014Boom!The black halberd swung, wrapped in majestic, dazzling power, splitting the air with piercing, high-pitched booms.\u201cDodge! Hurry!\u201d Qing Jin\u2019s pretty face filled with alarm, and she tried to push Su Yi out of the halberd\u2019s path.But to her astonishment, despite her immense power, pushing Su Yi felt like pushing a mountain. He didn\u2019t even budge.Clang!The low, clear hum of a sword reverberated through everyone\u2019s ears.A flash of sword light followed, like lightning illuminating the night sky and tearing through the inky darkness.Everyone\u2019s eyes pricked with pain, to the point that they almost cried.The Grandmaster felt his soul palpitate, and his eyes went blank. His awareness split, like chaos at the dawn of the universe. A streak of sword qi, like the eternal skies, surged from the void. It was so vast, so majestic, so lofty and ancient\u2026.Then, the streak of sword qi slashed ruthlessly down!A feeling of utter helplessness, insignificance, and despair surged throughout the Grandmaster\u2019s body. He shrieked in terror.\u201cNo\u2014!\u201d His voice shook the night sky, rolling like thunder.Everyone shuddered, and when they looked up, a terrifying sight greeted them\u2014The Grandmaster stopped mid-assault, his black-halberd frozen mid-swing. That staunch, swarthy face of his was now written with shock, terror, and despair.Then, he thudded to the ground, falling flat on his face. The impact shook the entire terrace.He had no trace of injuries, but it was as if his life force had evaporated into thin air, leaving nothing behind.\u201cNo\u2014!\u201d\u201cNo\u2014!\u201dThe man\u2019s final, desperate shout still echoed through the air.Witnessing this unnatural death made the onlookers\u2019 hair stand on end. Chills went down their spines.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d The middle-aged scholar and his subordinates were so stunned, they were rooted to the spot.How could a Martial Dao Grandmaster just drop dead all of a sudden? And in such a bizarre way?\u201cHe\u2019s dead? Just like that?\u201dThe purple-robed youth practically jumped. He looked bewildered, and his head buzzed. He even wondered if he was dreaming.Although he didn\u2019t notice it, his attendant, Zhang Duo, was uncharacteristically stunned. Witnessing the Grandmaster\u2019s death had shocked him too. Even his hands and feet trembled slightly.\u00a0What level of sword art is that!?\u201cMaster Su\u2019s methods are only getting more and more inscrutable!\u201d\u00a0Even Yuan Luoxi, Cheng Wuyong, and Huang Qianjun, with their understanding of Su Yi, were astonished. Waves coursed through their hearts; they couldn\u2019t have been any more shocked.A single swing of the sword, like a sudden crack of lightning, cleaving the night sky.And a Martial Dao Grandmaster died on the spot without any visible injuries. His manner of death was far too strange and terrifying.\u201cYou\u2026. You\u2026.\u201d Qing Jin was the closest, so her shock was the greatest. She could barely even speak.When the man in hemp clothes attacked, she planned to push Su Yi out of his way and save him from his own foolishness. Who\u2019d have thought that she\u2019d fail?But by attempting to save him, she witnessed how Su Yi attacked.He shook his wrist, and a sharp blade emerged from the bamboo staff, like a sudden bolt of lightning, cutting through the darkness at unbelievable speeds.But what left her truly baffled was that even as it struck, the sword was still a good ten meters from the Grandmaster. It didn\u2019t so much as touch the hems of his clothes.Yet he\u2019d just gone and died, and in such an unreasonable manner!As she stood there in a daze, Su Yi suddenly leaped past her and arrived before the lady assassin.Mortal Edge moved even faster than he did, effortlessly piercing a bloody hole right through the woman\u2019s throat.Splurt!Blood splattered from the wound.The woman\u2019s eyes went wide, her bewildered astonishment written all over her face.Witnessing the Grandmaster\u2019s death shocked her too; by the time she came to her senses, Su Yi\u2019s sword had already hit its mark. She was like a lamb to the slaughter, and she perished on the spot.\u201cLaughing at inopportune moments will get you killed,\u201d whispered Su Yi.He pulled his sword back out, not sparing the woman so much as a second glance as her corpse toppled over backward. He then turned his attention to the middle-aged scholar.The scholar and his followers came to their senses as well, and all of their expressions changed as their hearts surged with indescribale terror.The man in hemp clothes had been their pillar, yet now he\u2019d fallen, and after just one attack.Of course they were startled!\u201cHurry! Hurry up and run!\u201d The middle-aged scholar cried out, then turned and charged toward the stairs.His dozen-or-so black-robed subordinates took it a step further; they dashed toward the rails, hoping to jump from the ninth-floor terrace and into the waters of the Great Azure.But how could Cheng Wuyong, Zhand Duo, and the other martial artists just let them do as they please? They immediately charged into the fray and attacked.\u201cKill! We can\u2019t let those scoundrels escape!\u201d\u201cEveryone\u00a0attack\u00a0at once!\u201d\u201cGet them!\u201dThere were lots of people present, not just Su Yi\u2019s group. The other passengers, the group who\u2019d retreated earlier, included no shortage of martial artists.Now, all of these warriors charged, shouting and screaming as they charged.Su Yi had initially planned a follow-up attack, but when he saw this, he immediately stopped and sheathed his sword.He\u2019d always been lazy. If he could get others to do something for him, he certainly wouldn\u2019t volunteer to do it himself.He turned, found a chair, and sat down. He let out a breath of turbid air. When he sensed the feeling of exhaustion emanating from his soul, he couldn\u2019t help but mock himself.The attack he\u2019d just used to kill the middle-aged man in hemp was a soul technique he\u2019d only just begun cultivating, \u201cThe Great Void Soul Sword Incantation\u201d.His sword was like a divine mountain towering in the emptiness, towering into the heavens. It could attack the soul directly, killing someone without a trace of exterior wounds!This was a secret art of soul cultivators. It wasn\u2019t particularly grand or lofty, but that was why Su Yi could just barely put it to use with his current soul power reserves.Even so, that one attack had practically drained his soul completely.I have to pick up the pace with the Universel Self-Embodiment Sutra. Only then can I use the Great Void Soul Sword Incantation freely and easily,\u00a0thought Su Yi.As he pondered, Su Yi suddenly sensed the nearby purple-robed youth\u2019s gaze.Seth's ThoughtsHad a few people asking about a glossary?\u00a0Well, gaze upon it in all it's majesty!Gonna repeat this on a few other chapters to make sure people see it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Heart Surging Like the Tides, a Beautiful Brow FurrowsThe purple-robed youth\u2019s expressions were a sight to behold.There was shock, bewilderment, shame, and awkwardness, all alternating nonstop.He just stared directly at Su Yi, as if he wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t quite manage it.Having another man stare at him like that made Su Yi a bit uncomfortable. He couldn\u2019t help but frown and say, \u201cIf you want to apologize, no need. What you ought to do now is investigate and discover just who sent these people to assassinate you. I hope you can give me an answer before we arrive at the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital.\u201dThe purple-robed youth hurriedly responded, \u201cPlease rest at ease; I can definitely do that.\u201dEven his tone had become respectful.\u201cAlso, although I don\u2019t fear getting mixed up in all this, what happened tonight is highly likely to implicate others. I hope you can resolve that too,\u201d said Su Yi flatly.The purple-robed youth took a deep breath, then made a solemn vow. \u201cThat\u2019s only natural. This incident arose because of me; I won\u2019t allow any further harm to befall the innocent.\u201dYuan Luoxi watched this\u00a0play out from\u00a0the sidelines. Her maiden\u2019s heart trembled slightly, and she felt a wordless, indescribable warmth. When she next looked at Su Yi, her eyes shone with gratitude.She wouldn\u2019t have guessed that this\u00a0man like\u00a0a fallen\u00a0immortal would\u00a0be so thoughtful. He was looking out for them too, without overlooking the slightest detail.Su Yi said no more. He simply closed his eyes in repose.He wanted to leave earlier because he didn\u2019t want to get swept up in unnecessary trouble.But it was already too late to\u00a0avoid incident, so he naturally had to resolve this matter properly.After all, their foes hailed from a faction that dared assassinate an imperial prince of the Great Zhou. When they discovered what had happened tonight, they were sure to retaliate in a mad frenzy.Su Yi wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned, but it would be a problem if this implicated Yuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun.Something suddenly occurred to Su Yi, and he turned to the nearby Huang Qianjun. \u201cAh, yes. Go search their belongings and see if you can find any clues.\u201dHuang Qianjun hurriedly got to work.\u00a0A moment later, he returned carrying the black short halberd, but he looked baffled. \u201cHe was a glorious Martial Dao Grandmaster, yet he had nothing on him save for his weapon.\u201dSu Yi accepted the halberd and looked it over. \u201cHe came here determined to die. The reason his strength shot up earlier is because he traded his life for it. He used a secret art that destroyed his own life force.\u201dHuang Qianjun looked enlightened. \u201cNo wonder.\u201d\u201cAlthough this short halberd\u2019s craftsmanship is a bit lacking, the materials themselves are rather decent. It\u2019s made of Concentrated Profound Iron mixed with a dozen or so spiritual materials, including Pyrophosphate and Jadelight Silver Power. If I melt it down, it could just barely serve as a base for a spiritual sword.\u201dAfter briefly examining it, Su Yi stored the halberd within his jade pendant. He planned to refine it upon arriving in Cloudriver Prefecture.Mortal Edge had but the slightest trace of spirituality. It was just barely good enough to use, but its power was limited.Once his cultivation broke into the Qi Accumulation Realm, he wouldn\u2019t be able to display his full strength without a better weapon.Thus, Su Yi had already started considering how to gather enough spiritual materials to forge himself a quality blade.\u201cJudging by the sounds coming from the lower floors, we should be able to leave without encountering too many problems. Do you want to leave, or would you rather remain here?\u201d Su Yi rose, then glanced at the nearby Yuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun.\u201cWe\u2019re coming with you,\u201d they said without even pausing to think.Su Yi nodded, but as they walked past the purple-robed youth, he suddenly paused. \u201cWant to hear another suggestion?\u201dThe youth hurriedly clasped his fist. \u201cPlease don\u2019t withhold your wisdom.\u201dHe\u2019d already corrected his attitude. He no longer dared treat Su Yi as he might an ordinary person.Su Yi said offhandedly, \u201cAfter your subordinates return, return to your residence right away. Don\u2019t visit that Cha Jin girl again before we arrive in the prefectural capital.\u201dThe purple-robed youth was stunned, and he felt a bit awkward. He assumed that Su Yi was warning him not to wander randomly to prevent any additional assassination attempts.Su Yi saw through him at a glance, and he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, she has a hidden agenda for you.\u201dA hidden agenda!The youth went rigid, and waves of doubt rose within his heart. But before he could ask any questions, Su Yi led Yuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun away.When he reached the stairway, Su Yi\u2019s voice emanated from afar. \u201cTell that \u2018Martial Aunt Qing Jin\u2019 of yours not to forget what she agreed to tonight.\u201dThe youth was first dazed, then bewildered.\u00a0This guy\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s set his sights on Martial Aunt Qing Jin?The group proceeded down the stairs, passing evidence of battle. Corpses littered the ground, and blood splattered the walls and floors. However,\u00a0most of the corpses belonged to spirit beasts, which came in all shapes, sizes, and colors.Just walking through the carnage broadened Huang Qianjun\u2019s horizons, but it was as if Su Yi didn\u2019t even see it.\u00a0These spirit beasts were all tier-one and two, with the odd tier-three yao mixed in. Even the strongest of them was only on par with a peak Blood Circulation Realm martial artist.None of them were worthy of Su Yi\u2019s notice.When they returned to their temporary residence, the ninth pavilion, Su Yi went directly to his room.His soul was exhausted, and he\u2019d yet to cultivate today. He had to seize every available moment.Great willpower revealed itself through the small choices you made in your day-to-day life.Cultivation was much the same. It required withstanding the solitude and tedium, but at the same time, it took reflection and self-discipline. Only then could you persist day after day in perpetuity.With Su Yi\u2019s temperament, he wouldn\u2019t skip his daily cultivation unless he truly couldn\u2019t extricate himself from his situation.\u00a0In other words, Su Yi could let most worldly affairs go, but he always gave his cultivation his full attention and effort.Time slipped by.It was late at night when the fighting finally died down.Zhang Yiren was injured in battle, and of his thirty-seven elites, eleven fell, while the others all had varying degrees of injuries.Of the eight hundred captive beasts, over a hundred died, while some took advantage of the chaos to flee into the river. In the end, only five hundred were recaptured and returned to their cages.At the same time, five of the would-be assassins died in battle. Three were captured alive, and the remaining six escaped into the waters of the Great Azure.It was only after the curtain fell on tonight\u2019s battle that Zhang Yiren investigated and discovered the reason the tower ship had shaken so violently: they\u2019d collided with massive chains stretched all the way across the river.The chains went all the way across, and there were around ten of them, each about as thick as a tree trunk. All were underwater, making them difficult to discover.From this, Zhang Yiren could determine that their enemies had been preparing this ambush for quite some time!\u00a0Otherwise, they couldn\u2019t possibly have placed chains large enough to stretch and block the entire river on short notice.Fortunately, the damage to the boat was minimal. If the ship sank, their losses would have been unimaginable.The first pavilion.The candlelight illuminated Qing Jin\u2019s beautiful but pallid face. Her skin emanated a faint glow, and her ponytail had come undone. Her long hair was in disarray, an undercurrent of exhaustion amidst her indolence.She\u2019d already taken several recovery medicines, and she was currently meditating.Not far away, the purple-robed youth was listening to his subordinate, Zhang Duo\u2019s report. His expression changed erratically.Finally, his eyes glinted with icy light. \u201cWe cannot allow the three assassins we captured alive to die. Even if they\u2019re the type that values money more than their lives, we have to pry their mouths open and figure out just who they were working for!\u201dZhang Duo said solemnly, \u201cYes, sir!\u2019\u201cHave Li Mo go investigate the Garden of Blossom\u2019s Cha Jin. For now, don\u2019t alert her: everything is to happen in secret.\u201dZhang Duo was a bit confused, but he nevertheless nodded his assent.The youth pondered in silence for a moment, then added, \u201cAlso, prepare a generous gift. I\u2019m going to visit Su Yi in the ninth pavilion tomorrow morning.\u201dThis time, Zhang Duo was happy to agree. \u201cIt was Young Lord Su that turned back the tides tonight. He didn\u2019t just save your life; he saved all of us from certain doom too. It\u2019s only right that we thank him generously.\u201dThe youth waved him away. \u201cGo on.\u201dZhang Duo turned and left.The youth let out a long breath, then plopped into his chair, looking deeply exhausted.\u00a0Tonight\u2019s peril left him completely on edge. It was only after he finally relaxed that exhaustion washed over him, both physically and mentally.But when he considered how close he\u2019d come to death, he felt irrepressible rage growing within him, and his gaze turned dark and sinister.\u201cYou already suspect someone, don\u2019t you?\u201d said a certain uniquely magnetic voice.The youth\u2019s heart shook. He didn\u2019t know when, but the meditating Qing Jin had opened her eyes, and she was staring right at him.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He nodded, his tone grave and a bit icy. \u201cOnly my third brother knew about this operation. I suspect that even if he isn\u2019t the one behind this, he\u2019s almost certainly the reason word of our expedition leaked.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you always had a good relationship with His Third Highness?\u201d asked Qing Jin in confusion.The purple-robed youth sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re both Imperial Father\u2019s sons. We might be siblings, but we were born into the imperial family. Brothers with qualifications to succeed the throne are each other\u2019s greatest enemies.\u201dWhen he said this, he shook his head in dejection. It seemed he was unwilling to discuss this matter any further.\u201cThe mundane world\u2019s squabbles over imperial power are ultimately as immaterial as the passing clouds. Alas, those directly involved will never understand this,\u201d said Qing Jin with a hint of mockery. \u201cAllow me to warn you in advance: as soon as this operation is over, I\u2019ll return immediately to my sect.\u201dThe purple-robed youth froze, stunned, then laughed bitterly. \u201cI\u2019ve long since predicted that with your pure, lofty disposition, you couldn\u2019t possibly remain by my side. I just didn\u2019t expect that this day would come so quickly.\u201dQing Jin\u2019s expression was perfectly tranquil. \u201cI single-mindedly pursue the Dao. How could I ingratiate myself to mundane powers for personal profit? And you needn\u2019t act so pitiful; with your status, roping in a few Martial Dao Grandmasters should be easy.\u201dWhen he saw her put everything out in the open, the youth got his emotions under control and said no more.But then, he suddenly recalled something, and his expression went a little strange. \u201cMartial Aunt, there\u2019s something else I\u2019m afraid I must tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThat Su Yi guy told me to remind you not to forget what you said today.\u201dWhen she heard that, Qing Jin froze. Then, her sharp eyes narrowed, her peerlessly beautiful face suddenly rigid. She felt a wave of discomfort, as well as a thread of something strange and indescribable.That guy\u2026Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s set his sights on me?Beneath the candlelight, a beauty\u2019s heart rolled like the tide, and her delicate eyebrows knit together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - I\u2019ll Repay You with the Position of Imperial PreceptorMorning the next day.When Su Yi woke from his meditation, the tower ship had already resumed its journey down the Great Azure, and everything was peaceful once more.He left his room, and when he reached the first floor of their private pavilion, he saw his companions waiting for him. A sumptuous breakfast was already on the table.\u201cMaster Su, we were waiting for you to begin. Let\u2019s eat,\u201d said Yuan Luoxi chipperly.\u00a0Her eyes were bright as the light of dawn reflected in spring waters, and her tone was affectionate.Su Yi noticed the subtle change in her demeanor, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile. He casually took a seat. \u201cLet\u2019s eat together.\u201dOnly then did Yuan Luoxi, Cheng Wuyong, and Huang Qianjun take their seats.As they were eating, Cheng Wuyong suddenly started coughing.Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cWere you injured last night?\u201d\u201cA minor injury, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Cheng Wuyong with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big problem.\u201dHuang Qianjun couldn\u2019t help but interject, \u201cBrother Su, last night, Senior Cheng relentlessly chased that rogue who insulted you. He got injured in the life-or-death battle that followed.\u201d\u201dSu Yi was stunned for a moment before he suddenly recalled something. \u201cYou mean the man who promised to take my head off in a single swing?\u201dThe image of the middle-aged scholar he\u2019d seen the night before rose up in his mind.\u201cNone other,\u201d said Huang Qianjun with a smile. \u201cBut Cheng Wuyong already took his head off instead.\"\u201cThat was considerate of you.\u201d Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but glance at Cheng Wuyong.Cheng Wuyong said hurriedly, \u201cMaster Su, you needn\u2019t be so polite. It was the right thing to do.\u201dIt was then that a low voice rang out from beyond the door to the pavilion\u2014 \u201cOl\u2019 Cheng, is Young Lord Su awake?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Zhang Yiren,\u201d said Cheng Wuyong softly. \u201cMaster Su, he already knows what happened last night. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, he\u2019s here to thank you.\u201dWith that, Cheng Wuyong went to welcome their new guest.As Su Yi ate, he ordered Yuan Luoxi, \u201cTell me what happened last night.\u201d His tone was calm and natural.Yuan Luoxi instantly set down her bowl and chopsticks, then spoke in a tone reminiscent of a bird chirping from a secluded valley.\u00a0When Huang Qianjun saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but admire Su Yi.That\u2019s the pearl of the Yuan Family, the little princess famed throughout the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital! But Brother Su is talking to her as if she were a servant. Who\u2019d dare believe such a thing?How arrogant and unreasonable is Yuan Luoxi\u2019s personality? She even\u00a0dared kick\u00a0Young Master Zhang Yuanxing in the family jewels! But in front of Brother Su, she\u2019s downright meek and obedient!And looking at her face, she seems to like him\u2026.As a pampered playboy and frequent patron of Guangling City\u2019s brothels and flower boats, there was no way Huang Qianjun would miss it. He could tell that if Su Yi were interested, Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t escape his clutches. He\u2019d take her easily.Of course Huang Qianjun admired him!He thought himself an old hand at wooing women, and he had confidence in his approach.But now, Su Yi seemed to tower like a mountain; Huang Qianjun could only look up to him.\u00a0If Brother Su wanted to \u2018play the field\u2019, I\u2019m afraid even fairies and immortal beauties would fall right into his arms!The sound of footsteps drew near, interrupting Huang Qianjun\u2019s scattered thoughts.When he looked up, he saw the stalwart, grave, and resolute Zhang Yiren walking over alongside Cheng Wuyong.\u201cMaster Su, you needn\u2019t get up. I\u2019m only here to express my gratitude. I\u2019ll leave as soon as I\u2019m finished.\u201d When he saw that Su Yi was about to rise, Zhang Yiren hurriedly gestured for him to sit back down.Then, he cupped his fist, crossed his arms, and bowed solemnly at the waist.He was indeed the straightforward type. Even his gratitude was clear and to the point. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he turned and left.But Cheng Wuyong was beside himself. He sighed with emotion, \u201cMaster Su, that bow Zhang Yiren did just now? That\u2019s the Greenplate Army\u2019s highest ceremonial show of respect. It represents a great benevolence that\u2019s yet to be repaid, a kindness to be remembered at all times. It\u2019s an expression of his willingness to repay you no matter what, even if it kills him!\u201dSu Yi couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. He nodded. \u201cSomeone like him is worthy of praise.\u201dImmediately before his departure, Zhang Yiren presented a generous gift, a jar of spirit wine.This wine was called \u201cBlizzard Stride,\u201d and the Spiritmartial Marquis, Chen Zheng, had brewed it himself.He soaked sixteen types of spiritual medicine in the blood essence of tier-four spirit beasts, then buried the jars deep in ice and snow to absorb their piercingly cold energies. The wine only reached full maturity after a decade.The wine contained surging spirituality and vitality. It far surpassed ordinary tier-two medicines.The value of a jar of wine like this was impossible to estimate.Blizzard Stride? Great winds and snow, descending with aplomb. The name is actually rather extraordinary,\u00a0thought Su Yi.Presenting him with such a generous gift made it obvious just how grateful Zhang Yiren was.Su Yi opened the jar and poured a cup. The liquid was a bright, clear red, lustrous as nectar, with an extremely potent alcoholic fragrance.\u201cYou decapitated my enemy for me, so allow me to \u2018borrow another\u2019s flowers as an offering to the Buddha.\u2019\u00a0Consider\u00a0this wine is a show of my respect.\u201d Su Yi raised the glass, then gave it to Cheng Wuyong.Cheng Wuyong was stunned and flattered. He hurriedly accepted it. \u201cThank you for generously sharing your wine.\u201d\u201cNo need to be polite. It should help your wounds heal,\u201d said Su Yi offhandedly.When he saw Yuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun staring pathetically at him, he couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThis wine is extremely potent. If you drink it now, you\u2019ll spend the rest of the day cultivating. Let\u2019s wait for evening, then drink together.\u201dYuan Luoxi and Huang Qianjun smiled and agreed.Not long after, the purple-robed youth and Qing Jin paid them a visit as well.\u201cYoung Lord Su, fortunately, you were there to help us last night. It\u2019s thanks to you that we averted an enormous crisis. Here\u2019s a humble gift, a token of my respect. Please accept it.\u201dAs soon as he stepped through the door, the purple-robed youth proffered a gift box in both hands.When he saw that Su Yi didn\u2019t object, Huang Qianjun shot to his feet and accepted it.Cheng Wuyong, meanwhile, smiled and invited the youth and Qing Jin to sit down.When they faced the sixth prince, even Yuan Luoxi and company were noticeably more reserved than usual.But Su Yi just sat there leisurely as if none of that had anything to do with him. \u201cHave you already finished your investigation?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t keep it a secret: after last night\u2019s interrogation, we\u2019ve already determined that the assassins all hailed from the \u2018Starbane Alliance.\u2019The youth continued gravely, \u201cThey\u2019re an underworld organization lying dormant in the empire\u2019s dark underbelly. The experts under their command are all heinous evildoers.\u201cSomeone hired them to carry out this operation. Their client promised ten thousand taels of gold, one hundred stalks of spiritual medicine, ten profound-grade secret tomes, as well as a heaven-grade cultivation technique\u2026..\u201dWhen he saw that the youth seemed to have more to say, Su Yi cut him off. \u201cWho hired them?\u201dThe purple-youth instantly looked a bit awkward. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know either. They made contact with their client through an anonymous middleman.\u201dSu Yi had anticipated something like this, so he didn\u2019t find it strange. \u201cThen who do you think the mastermind who hired them is?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d The purple-robed youth hesitated, then said, \u201cMy guess is that this incident can be traced back to my third brother.\u201dThe third prince!Yuan Luoxi and Cheng Wuyong looked at each other, shock written on their faces.\u201cConflict between princes? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s yet another inheritance struggle.\u201d Su Yi shook his head.This was a mundane nation. Even its martial artists saw imperial authority as the ultimate power, and they went mad over it.The purple-robed youth pondered, then suddenly rose and clasped his fist. \u201cYoung Lord Su, there's no need to hide the truth any longer. My full name is Zhou Zhili, and I am the sixth prince in the direct line of descent. Last night, I witnessed your peerless bearing, and I\u2026..Before the prince even finished speaking, Su Yi chuckled. \u201cYou want me to work for you?\u201dZhou Zhili\u2019s expression was earnest, his words sincere. \u201cWith your support, I\u2019d be like a tiger granted wings! I can guarantee that, should you aspire to governmental office, I can assist you in becoming a king or minister.\u201cOr if you single-mindedly pursue the Dao, I can do everything in my power to scour the empire for rare and secret arts!\u201dHe paused, and his eyes shone with determination. \u201cAnd if I one day claim the throne, I\u2019ll be certain to name you imperial preceptor!\u201dJust hearing these words sent waves through Su Yi\u2019s companions\u2019 hearts; they were utterly shaken.An imperial preceptor!In the Great Zhou, the position of imperial preceptor was second only to that of the emperor. Their status was so lofty and their authority so vast that oftentimes, even princes needed to rely on their prestige.Take the current Imperial Preceptor, Hong Shenshang.He was the head of one of the Jade Capital\u2019s peak-level clans, as well as the palace head of \u201cPhoenix Pass Academy\u201d, one of the Great Zhou\u2019s ten great academies.Furthermore, he himself was a long-established Xiantian Martial Ancestor. The power of his Martial Dao was profound and inscrutable!\u201cImperial preceptor?\u201d Against all expectations, Su Yi merely arched his brow and said flatly, \u201cSetting aside the fact that I have no desire for such a title, you\u2019re just the sixth prince; you\u2019ve never held true authority. Your words are nothing but rhetoric and empty promises. How pompous!\u201dZhou Zhili was dazed, and his cheeks flushed red. \u201cMaster Su, I sincerely hope you can lend me a hand. I dare swear to the heavens that I meant every word I said. If I\u00a0uttered\u00a0any falsehoods, may I die a terrible death!\u201d\u201cNo need to say more,\u201d said Su Yi indifferently. What a joke! A mere prince? Was he worthy of Su Xuanjun\u2019s allegiance?He was off his rocker!Zhou Zhili instantly fell silent, then slumped dejectedly into a chair.He felt stifled. Were Su Yi anyone else, even a Martial Dao Grandmaster, he likely would have agreed by now.Yet Su Yi stubbornly disdained to lower his head!\u00a0This inevitably left the prince a bit frustrated.After witnessing this entire exchange, Yuan Luoxi, Cheng Wuyong, and Huang Qianjun lamented inwardly.The way they saw it, Zhou Zhili had made an enormous mistake. He simply didn\u2019t understand that Su Yi was like a fallen immortal wandering the mortal realm. How could mere mundane wealth and authority buy his loyalty?Had Zhou Zhili humbled himself, set aside his position as prince, and approached Su Yi as a friend, he might very well have won himself some of Su Yi\u2019s benevolence.Suddenly, Qing Jin spoke up, her words carrying a hint of rebuke. \u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? Those experts whose aspirations are focused on their cultivation disdain the wealth and power of the mundane world. I told you, but you refused to listen.\u201dZhou Zhili smiled bitterly and shook his head.How was he supposed to know that this youth with lofty and inscrutable attainments in martial arts already saw wealth and authority as no more important than the passing clouds?Zhou Zhili took a deep breath then said lightly, \u201cNo matter. I was fortunate enough to meet you; I\u2019m already pleased. Besides, you saved my life. I\u2019ll naturally bear your benevolence in mind.\u201dHe then rose and prepared to leave, but Qing Jin hesitated. Then, she seemed to\u00a0steel\u00a0herself.She looked up, turning her beautiful face toward Su Yi, and her sharp eyes bore into him. \u201cI know what I said last night, and I intend to keep my word. Tell me: what is it you want me to do?\u201dHer tone was decisive, like a convict awaiting sentencing and mentally preparing herself for death.Everyone\u2019s expressions suddenly went strange.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - The True Interpretation of Spiritmist, the Cloudriver Prefectural CapitalQing Jin might have looked composed, but inwardly, she was frantic.Due to a single sentence uttered in a crisis, she spent the whole night tossing and turning, barely sleeping a wink for fear that Su Yi would demand something shameless and excessive.That was why this morning, she steeled herself to come along and lay everything out in the open.If she had to face this sooner or later anyway, it was better to get it over with. Still,\u00a0now that she truly faced the matter head-on, she couldn\u2019t help but tense up.I hope my guess is right. Given his temperament, he\u2019s unlikely to demand anything over the line\u2026\u00a0Qing Jin prayed to herself.In her eyes, while Su Yi looked young, and although he was quiet and indifferent, he was proud right down to his bones.She\u2019d only seen eyes like that, eyes that took everything in with calm indifference, back in the sect. Some of the elders, the true experts, had gazes like that too.All were mighty figures capable of shaking the entire Great Zhou Dynasty with a single stomp of their foot.But if anything, they seemed\u00a0less\u00a0proud than Su Yi. He gave off the impression that he saw everything beneath the heavens as fleeting and insignificant; he felt no need to concern himself with any of it!His eyes were empty; he saw nothing worthy of his attention.Qing Jin found it rather strange.\u00a0He\u2019s a live-in son-in-law from a minor city. How could he be prouder than the heavens?There\u2019s definitely something strange about it.But it was precisely because she could sense Su Yi\u2019s deep-rooted pride that she was fairly certain that he\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t demand anything she couldn\u2019t accept, nor would he humiliate her.Time seemed to slow to a crawl.\u00a0An instant passed before Su Yi responded, but to Qing Jin, it felt longer than a year. She was inwardly tormented with nervousness.But in the end, Su Yi merely glanced at her and asked, \u201cWhy are you so tense?\u201d\u201cOh? Am I tense?\u201d Qing Jin feigned calm, her bright eyes meeting Su Yi\u2019s gaze directly, as if trying to prove that she wasn\u2019t nervous in the least.However, her eyes inadvertently revealed a thread of panic, betraying her true feelings.\u201cIf you use any more force, your fingernails are going to rip the hems of your clothes right off,\u201d laughed Su Yi.Qing Jin froze, then looked down. Only then did she realize that she\u2019d unwittingly started fidgeting with the fabric of her clothes. Her fingers exerted so much force that the veins\u00a0bulged\u00a0on the backs of her hands.Her beautiful face flushed bright red, and her eyes flashed with shame and rage. She glared viciously at Su Yi, \u201cJust tell me! Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for going back on my word!\u201dZhou Zhili watched this play out in a daze.\u00a0So, Martial Aunt is shy too?Su Yi merely muttered, \u201cYou have a Spiritmist Jade Physique. In this mundane word, that sets you apart, and I just so happen to be lacking a serving girl. If you\u2019re willing to follow me, within a year at most, I won\u2019t just return your freedom\u2014I\u2019ll even help you fully realize the innate talents of your physique.\u201dWhen he finished his offer, the entire room fell so quiet, you could hear a pin drop.Yuan Luoxi and the others\u2019 eyes widened. This woman\u2019s attainments in the Martial Dao were so terrifying, she was on par with a Grandmaster, and her status was obviously lofty; even the sixth prince called her \u201cMaster Aunt\u201d!But now Su Yi wanted her as his serving girl!?Zhou Zhili couldn\u2019t help but gasp. He knew Qing Jin\u2019s status better than anyone, and when he heard Su Yi\u2019s request, his mind went blank.If the sect behind Qing Jin found out about this, how would they react?Qing Jin was similarly dazed. She stared directly at him.She\u2019d long since decided that if Su Yi really coveted her good looks, that if he really demanded anything shameless, she\u2019d refuse, even if it meant a fight to the death.Who could have guessed that he\u2019d demand something even more unreasonable?He actually\u2026. He actually wants me as his serving girl?\u00a0Qing Jin\u2019s entire face flushed red, and she clenched her teeth, her bright eyes sharp as knives. Beneath her loose clothing, her ample chest heaved.\u201cWho do you think I am?\u201d Qing Jin paused for emphasis between each word, murderous intent billowing around her.Everyone suddenly tensed up.Except for Su Yi, who merely frowned. \u201cAn opportunity to follow me is a stroke of fortune others might fail to obtain no matter how much karmic merit they accumulated.\u201d\u201cA stroke of fortune?\u201d Qing Jin was so angry, she laughed. Her sect had treated her as the chosen daughter of heaven since she was little. She could speak freely even in front of an imperial prince like Zhou Zhili.Yet now, someone was looking down on her to such a degree? Of course she was angry!If not for the fact that Su Yi had saved her life last night, she might very well have drawn her sabers and cleaved this shameless braggart in half by now.Simply detestable!Against all expectations, Su Yi laughed too. \u201cI know. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re resigned to this, and you think I\u2019m just saying this to humiliate you. But it won\u2019t be too late to make up your mind after you\u2019ve read this.\u201dAs he spoke, he took a rolled-up piece of paper from his jade pendant and passed it to her.Qing Jin was stunned. She forced down her fury, accepted the paper, and opened it, only for the first line of text to stun her again. \u201cThe True Interpretation of Spiritmist?\u201dShe continued reading.Within moments, she was completely immersed. Irrepressible emotions surfaced on her brow: surprise, bewilderment, shock, excitement, and more. Her beautiful face changed erratically.This made even Zhou Zhili, Yuan Luoxi and the others curious. They couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was written on that paper.Alas, it was too far away for them to see clearly.A while later, Qing Jin reluctantly looked away. It seemed she\u2019d yet to get her fill. She stood there, dazed and silent.Her inner turmoil was obvious to all of them!It was then that Su Yi said calmly, \u201cThat\u2019s just the introduction, a rough overview of its principles. The way I see it, with your powers of comprehension, you should be able to fully comprehend the text\u2019s mysteries within a year. But of course, if you\u2019re unwilling, forget it. I won\u2019t lower myself by pushing the matter.\u201dThe page\u2019s contents were from something he called \u201cthe True Interpretation of Spiritmist.\u201d It described the subtle mysteries of the innately talented Spiritmist Jade Physique, and it included numerous incantations for unearthing further abilities as well as practical applications for the physique\u2019s power.He thought back to his past life. To research and deduce the applications of various types of innate talent in pursuit of the Dao, he\u2019d used the \u201cthe Heavens\u2019 Guide to Spiritual Physiques\u201d as his basis, searching the world for bearers of all kinds of spiritual physiques. He then researched and pondered their mysteries, one by one. It was fair to say his gains were enormous.The \u201cTrue Interpretation of Spiritmist\u201d was but one of the incantations he\u2019d developed through this research.Everyone glanced at Qing Jin, as if interested to see what she\u2019d decide.After a while, Qing Jin finally stuttered awkwardly, \u201cCan\u2026. Can I take some time to think it over?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Su Yi nodded. \u201cBut my patience is limited. You must give me a clear answer before we arrive in the prefectural capital.\u201dQing Jin inwardly sighed in relief, and she didn\u2019t linger. She and Zhou Zhili bade him farewell, then hurried away.Once she was gone, Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMaster Su, if you\u2019re in need of serving girls, I can help you find some. Any personality you like, and as many as you want.\u201dSu Yi laughed. \u201cI merely saw a rare innate spiritual physique and felt a bit curious. Of course, it\u2019s fine if she refuses: we all have our own ambitions.\u201dHuang Qianjun lamented, \u201cBrother Su, only you have the confidence to try something like that. Anyone else, and I\u2019m afraid Qing Jin would have already killed them in a rage.\u201dCheng Wuyong couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cFrom my perspective, rather than saying Master Su is demanding something of her, it\u2019d be better to say he\u2019s offering her an opportunity to change her destiny. Whether she takes it or not is up to her.\u201dSu Yi smiled, but he didn\u2019t deny it.Yuan Luoxi suddenly recalled something. \u201cRight, Master Su, we\u2019ll arrive at the prefectural capital tomorrow night. If you don\u2019t already have a place to stay, why not come to my family\u2019s estate?\u201d\u201cI naturally have a place to stay.\u201d Su Yi shook his head. He couldn\u2019t help but recall the three years he\u2019d spent at Blueriver Sword Manor, as well as some of the people and incidents he\u2019d encountered in the prefectural capital.And, of course, Wen Lingxue.\u2026\u2026The eighth day of the second lunar month.Outside the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, a pier extended into the Great Azure. Countless boats were docked there, and the port was lively as could be.The enormous tower ship gradually drew closer.Su Yi gazed at the riverbank and the distant outline of the city from the latticed windows of the ninth pavilion. He couldn\u2019t help but mutter to himself, \u201cCloudriver Prefectural Capital, I, Su Yi, have returned\u2026.\u201dThe Cloudriver Prefectural Capital was the heart of the nineteen cities of the Cloudriver Prefecture, with a population of over three million.Furthermore, the Blueriver Sword\u00a0Manor famed\u00a0throughout all nineteen cities of Cloudriver\u00a0Prefecture was\u00a0built here.Compared to Guangling City, the prefectural capital was unquestionably far more prosperous and densely populated.Factions big and small occupied chunks of the city, while martial artists were as numerous as the clouds.Throughout the prefecture, practically any young genius or youth with aspirations of pursuing the martial way gathered here.\u201cMaster Su, the boat is about to dock near the harbor. Shall we prepare to disembark?\u201d Yuan Luoxi wore her usual military attire, a hint of excitement on her face.She was about to return home. This spoiled, unreasonable little princess was obviously delighted.Cheng Wuyong and Huang Qianjun had already gotten their things in order too.Seeing this, Su Yi nodded. He walked straight out of the pavilion.\u201cSu Yi.\u201d Before they got far, he saw Qing Jin walk over from afar.Her wounds had fully knit together, and her long hair was in its usual ponytail. Her skin was clear as ice or jade, and the look on her exquisitely formed features suggested that she was in high spirits. Her shocking beauty set her apart from the masses.When she walked over, before Su Yi could even speak, she announced, \u201cI\u2019ve already thought it through. You might very well have good intentions, but I don\u2019t want to lower myself before you!\u201dHer figure was tall and slender, and she crossed her arms across her chest and pursed her red lips. Her bright, dewy eyes shone with pride.\u201cAn admirable decision,\u201d said Su Yi with a calm smile.Qing Jin saw no sign of disappointment in Su Yi\u2019s gaze, which left her a bit stunned. She paused to consider her words before saying, \u201cBut I still owe you my life, and I\u2019ll be certain to repay you one day.\u201dSu Yi thought nothing of it. \u201cNo need. If you ask me, you\u2019d be better off worrying about that martial nephew of yours. It might prevent future disasters.\u201dQing Jin hesitated, looking a bit embarrassed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, might I be so bold as to inquire where you obtained \u2018the True Interpretation of\u00a0Spiritmist\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the result of my own pondering,\u201d said Su Yi casually.Qing Jin was stunned. She couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cIf you ask me, producing a miraculous tome on the level of \u2018the True Interpretation of Spiritmist\u2019 is likely beyond even Earthly Immortals. You\u2019re just disappointed that I refused to become your servant, right? Otherwise, why would you say something so ridiculous?\u201dShe obviously thought Su Yi was deliberately refusing to tell her the truth.Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cRemember what I told you yesterday: an opportunity to become my servant is a blessing others can only dream of, no matter how much karmic merit they accumulate. How about this? If it\u2019s\u00a0fated, we\u2019ll meet again.\u201cNo, wait. It\u2019d be better if we didn\u2019t meet again; I certainly have no desire to get swept up into needless trouble again.\u201dWith that, he continued walking ahead. Yuan Luoxi and the others hurried after him.Beneath the light of the heavens, a young man in blue robes walked away, hands behind his back, leisurely and contented.Qing Jin froze on the spot, watching Su Yi\u2019s figure fade into the distance, feeling inexplicably conflicted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - The Redscale Valiant, Talent on Par With KingsI just don\u2019t know how to go about obtaining the full True Interpretation of Spiritmist from Su Yi.\u00a0Qing Jin fell silent for a while, then sighed in her heart, feeling a bit despondent.\u201cMartial Aunt Qing Jin, what did Su Yi say?\u201d Zhou Zhili walked over, accompanied by Zhang Duo and three other attendants.\u201cIn his heart, he\u2019s definitely unhappy about it.\u201d Qing Jin gently pursed her red lips, and her bright, knife-sharp eyes were calm as the surface of a lake.The sect behind her was strong enough to influence the politics of the entire Great Zhou dynasty, and many of her seniors in the sect doted on her.She was confident that even without borrowing Su Yi\u2019s power, she could carve out a place for herself along the path of the Martial Dao!\u201cAfter we finish this operation, we can find a chance to seek Su Yi out. No matter what, I have to help you try and get your hands on the full text,\u201d said Zhou Zhili solemnly.\u201cHe might look young, but he\u2019s enormously proud. I refused to agree to his conditions, so I\u2019m afraid he now carries a grudge. If you go ask him for help, you\u2019ll leave empty-handed. Worse, you\u2019ll only make him look down on you.\u201d Qing Jin stretched her slender, flexible waist, looking languid. \u201cBut then, we both owe him a favor. If he encounters trouble in the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, we can lend a hand.\u201dEven as she spoke, she continued ahead.\u2026..\u201cMaster Su, yesterday I received a messenger pigeon from the marquis himself. He ordered me to express my gratitude once more.\u201d Zhang Yiren personally came to see Su Yi off, his tone hearty and forthright. \u201cHe also said that, before long, he plans to visit the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital as well. Apparently, he intends to recruit a new group of talented youths from Blueriver Sword Manor to join the Redscale Army. If the timing works out, he\u2019ll pay you a visit in person.\u201dBefore Su Yi could speak, Huang Qianjun exclaimed, \u201cThe Spiritmartial Marquis is going to recruit in the prefectural capital?\"Zhang Yiren nodded. \u201cIndeed. Our Redscale Army recruits new blood every other year to replenish our ranks.\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s eyes filled with irrepressible longing. \u201cEver since I was a little boy, it\u2019s been my dream to fight on the battlefield, to laugh and feast and drink the blood of spirit beasts. If there\u2019s an opportunity to join up, I\u2019ll have to try my luck.\u201dZhang Yiren burst into laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s what a man of the Great Zhou is supposed to be like! If I weren\u2019t leaving so soon, I\u2019d insist on treating you to a few rounds of hard drinking!\u201dHuang Qianjun grinned, but\u00a0Yuan Luoxi\u2019s bright eyes turned toward Su Yi. She whispered, \u201cMaster Su, where will you be staying after we reach the city?\u201dSu Yi pondered, then said, \u201cDeep within Willow Alley.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of place is that?\u201d Yuan Luoxi asked Cheng WuyongCheng Wuyong seemed a bit uncertain. \u201cI vaguely recall that that\u2019s\u2026. An alleyway where the poor gather. It\u2019s near the southern corner of the city.\u201d\u2018A place where the poor gather\u2019? You mean a slum?\u00a0Yuan Luoxi was stunned, but she knew better than to pry. She just silently committed the name to memory.As they conversed, a voice as stern as iron emanated from further down the pier. \u201cLuoxi, Elder Cheng, we\u2019re over here!\u201dThe pier was densely packed, but one line-up was particularly eye-catching. Over a hundred armored guards stood in a neat formation, leading horses and standing at attention.A quietly graceful, beautiful woman stood at the front of this grand procession.\u00a0Her dark hair was tied up in a bun, displaying her long, slender neck. Her thin waist was upright, and she had the unique charm only time could give a woman.The one who just spoke was the youth beside her.\u00a0He was tall and well-built, with broad shoulders and a thin waist. He wore warrior\u2019s robes, and he had a fierce, valiant air. He stood out from the crowd, like a crane among chickens.\u201cWhy are my mom and second brother here?\u201d exclaimed Yuan Luoxi.\u201cWhen their children are far away, mothers worry. She\u2019s probably here because she missed you too much. I\u2019m more surprised to see the second young master. Hasn\u2019t he been training in the Redscale Army?\u201d Cheng Wuyong said in a low voice. The sight of that stalwart youth surprised him too.The beautiful older woman was none other than Yuan Luoxi\u2019s mother, Leng Yuqiu, the official wife of the head of the Yuan Family.And the one beside her was her second older brother, Yuan Luoyu!Within the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, Yuan Luoyu was a monster of the Martial Dao; he had innate divine strength that members of the same generation struggled to match.At thirteen, he\u2019d relied on nothing but his fists to dominate the entire Yuan Family's younger generation, revealing his dazzling sharpness.At fifteen, he\u2019d been sent to Shen Jiusong, the Cloudlight Marquis\u2019 Redscale Army for further training. A few years later, he already had an outstanding record of military accomplishments, and at just seventeen, he assumed command of ten thousand men. He was the youngest officer of such rank in the entire Redscale Army.Even the Cloudlight Marquis praised him as \u201cthe Redscale Valiant, one with the talent of a king or marquis\u201d!\u201cUncle Yong, don\u2019t forget our agreement,\u201d whispered Yuan Luoxi at top speed.Cheng Wuyong\u2019s expression was suddenly strange.Last night, Yuan Luoxi told him that she hoped he wouldn\u2019t tell their friends and relatives in the family about Su Yi. She wanted Cheng Wuyong\u2019s lips sealed tight.Her reasoning was that she feared her family would, upon learning of Su Yi\u2019s skill, attempt to investigate him, and that in doing so, they might disturb him. If so, it might result in unpredictable consequences.Her motivations were partly selfish, too: she didn\u2019t want her clan\u2019s intervention to change the nature of her relationship with Su Yi.Cheng Wuyong already had a certain degree of understanding of Su Yi\u2019s nature, and he knew that although this enormously capable young man might seem as calm as a stagnant pool, in reality, his pride was bone-deep.If the Yuan Family investigated him by force, it would likely win them Su Yi\u2019s displeasure and aversion. That was why, after thinking it over, Cheng Wuyong agreed to Yuan Luoxi\u2019s request. Still,\u00a0he was well aware that they could only keep this under wraps for so long.So long as the Yuan Family willed it, they\u2019d discover everything that happened both in Guangling City and on board the tower ship, right down to the slightest detail.\u201cCommander Zhang, we\u2019re going to take our leave.\u201d When he saw that Yuan Luoxi\u2019s family was already waiting at the docks, Su Yi cupped his fist and decided to leave.\u201cJust as mountains are constant, the flow of the river never ceases, and neither shall our gratitude. Master Su, take care of yourself!\u201d Zhang Yiren waved with a hearty smile.Su Yi nodded, then turned and disembarked. Yuan Luoxi and the others followed shortly after.When they reached the pier, the stalwart, valiant Yuan Luoyu grumbled irritably, \u201cGirl, didn\u2019t you notice that mom and I were waiting for you? You sure took your sweet time. In the past, I\u2019d have smacked you!\u201dAlthough he said this, he smiled with his eyes, his gaze completely doting and affectionate.\u201cWho asked you to wait for me?\u201d Yuan Luoxi rolled her eyes and said irritably, \u201cAnd why did you bring so many attendants? Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit attention-seeking?\u201dThen, she whipped around and pulled her mother, Leng Yuqiu, into a two-armed embrace. She immediately smiled. \u201cMom, you actually came all this way to welcome me? That means you must have missed me, right?\u201dThe rims of Leng Yuqiu\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, but her words were cold and harsh. \u201cYou\u2019re so young, yet you snuck out of the prefectural capital? How would I face your father if something happened to you?\u201dYuan Luoxi stuck out her tongue, not the least bit concerned. \u201cI\u2019m back, alive and in one piece, aren\u2019t I? Don\u2019t worry so much!\u201dLeng Yuqiu looked around, and her gaze landed on Su Yi and Huang Qianjun. \u201cElder Cheng, who might these two young lords be?\u201dFrom the pier, she sensed that Yuan Luoxi and Su Yi had exchanged quite a few words. Add that to Su Yi\u2019s handsome good looks and calm aloof temperament, and it was obvious he was extraordinary. As a mother, how could Leng Yuqiu\u00a0not\u00a0notice him?Cheng Wuyang said solemnly, \u201cMa\u2019am, this is Young Lord Su, and this is Young Lord Huang. The young miss and I paid a visit to Guangling City\u2019s Mother Ghost Ridge, and the two of them helped us avoid numerous dangers.\u201dCheng Wuyong paused, then continued, \u201cThey\u2019re in the prefecture capital to travel and temper themselves, so we wound up traveling together.\u201dAh, so they\u2019re from that backwater, Guangling City?\u00a0Leng Yuqiu\u2019s gaze was suddenly much calmer, and she said in a prim, reserved tone, \u201cElder Cheng, have you thanked the two young lords appropriately?\u201d\u201cPlease rest assured, Ma\u2019am. I naturally wouldn\u2019t dare forget to repay their kindness.\u201dYuan Luoyu\u2019s gaze lingered on the two of them; he was sizing them up too. Suddenly, he said in a low voice, \u201cFriends, you helped Luoxi, and that makes you our family\u2019s distinguished guests. If you run into problems in the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, you are welcome to call upon the Yuan Family name. I trust it will be useful.\u201d He spoke with obvious confidence, but also disdain.Hearing him, Cheng Wuyong and Yuan Luoxi couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty. They glanced at Su Yi and Huang Qianjun, as if trying to say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t take offense.\u201dSu Yi smiled faintly, not the least bit concerned.\u00a0Huang Qianjun, meanwhile, was stunned by the sheer size of the Yuan Family\u2019s procession; he was in no place to notice minor details like that.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, and your father is still waiting for you at home. We should go back.\u201d Leng Yuqiu took Yuan Luoxi\u2019s arm and said gently.Yuan Luoyu somersaulted onto the horse and shouted, \u201cRide!\u201dThe hundred-plus armored guards all took action. A procession of that size and grandeur made many of those gathered on the pier gasp.Su Yi and Huang Qianjun seemed to have been forgotten.When Huang Qianjun watched the grand procession pass through the pier and disappear through the city gates, he finally reacted.\u201cBrother Su, why were Miss Yuan and Senior Cheng so cold just now?\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cIt seems they deliberately failed to introduce us properly?\u201d\u201cTell me,\u201d said Su Yi. \u201cWhat would the Yuan Family do if they knew that I\u2019d saved Yuan Luoxi\u2019s life? What would they think?\u201d\u201cOf course they\u2019d treat you as their distinguished guest!\u201d Huang Qianjun said without hesitation, but then he said sheepishly, \u201cNo, wait. That doesn\u2019t sound right. The higher someone\u2019s position, the more thought they tend to give such things. There\u2019s no way they\u2019d believe that so easily.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Yuan Luoxi\u2019s behavior was actually quite considerate. She\u2019s undoubtedly worried that if she tells her family about us, they won\u2019t be able to resist investigating, which would likely lead to conflict.\u201d\u00a0As he said this, Su Yi pointed to the nearby riverbank and said, \u201cLook. See that old man fishing over there? He\u2019s actually a hidden Martial Dao Grandmaster.\u201dHuang Qianjun instinctively looked over and saw a bare-footed old man in a conical hat. He was bending over to wash a worn-out fishing net, and his gaunt, weathered face was dark and covered in wrinkles.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it!\u201d Huang Qianjun furrowed his brow, but Su Yi said no more.Huang Qianjun immediately realized what he was trying to convey. \u201cYou\u2019re right; if you say something like that out of nowhere, even someone like me won\u2019t believe it, much less the higher-ups of the Yuan Family.\u201d\u201cRemember this: as people live out their lives, regardless of whether they live in the mundane world or the world of cultivation, differences in breadth of vision, strength, and position will inevitably lead to prejudice and conflict. It\u2019s been like that since the ancient era, and it\u2019s still that way today.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bear your teachings within my heart. I won\u2019t forget for the rest of my life!\u201d said Huang Qianjun with a solemn bow.But Su Yi merely smiled drily, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to know but hard to put into practice. Even if you understood more of such principles, what good would it do you? So long as you\u2019re strong enough, there\u2019s no need to concern yourself with such things anyway.\u201d He then put his hands behind his back and walked off.Huang Qianjun hurried after him.But although he didn\u2019t notice it, the old man in conical hat, the swarthy, wrinkled fisherman washing his nets, looked stunned.\u00a0Did that boy in blue just see through my identity?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - Men Have TearsShortly after Su Yi and Huang Qianjun left, Zhou Zhili, Qing Jin, Zhang Duo, and the other guards left the tower ship, one after another.\u201cSixth Highness.\u201d The old man in the conical hat clasped his fist, a smile on his thoroughly wrinkled face. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for quite some time.\u201dZhou Zhili lit up with delight, and he hurriedly returned the greeting. \u201cElder Mu, I\u2019m shocked and flattered that you would come in person.\u201dQing Jin\u2019s painted eyebrows shot up; she recognized the old man.Mu Zhongting!He was the governor of one of the Imperatorial Province\u2019s Harmony Prefecture, a Martial Dao Grandmaster in possession of enormous authority.The Harmony Prefecture bordered the Cloudriver Prefecture. From the Harmony Prefectural Capital to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital took a day on horseback traveling at top speeds.The \"aged fisherman\", Mu Zhongting, scanned the area. \u201cSixth Highness, we shouldn\u2019t linger here. Let\u2019s go talk more in the city.Zhou Zhili happily agreed.Meanwhile, back on the tower ship,\u00a0Zhang Yiren watched Zhou Zhili and Mu Zhongting leave, then sank into thought.\u00a0Just what is the purpose of the sixth prince\u2019s expedition?Also, Marquis Cheng said that before long, he\u2019ll be paying the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital a visit too. Don\u2019t tell me the timing is just a coincidence?A while passed before Zhang Yiren shook his head and gave the matter no further thought.Within the city.Streets and alleyways branched in all directions, like a spider's web. The streets were bustling with pedestrians darting to and fro. It was like a painting of a flourishing, densely-populated scene of the mundane world.It wasn\u2019t really any different from the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital Su Yi remembered.\u00a0After all, only a little over a year had passed since his expulsion from Blueriver Sword Manor.If anything had changed in that time, it was him.As Su Yi strolled leisurely through the city\u2019s streets and alleyways, he asked, \u201cAre you going to enroll at Blueriver Sword Manor right now? Or do you have other plans?\u201d\u201cI want to accompany you until you\u2019re settled,\u201d Huang Qianjun responded hurriedly. \u201cIt won\u2019t be too late to register afterward.\u201dHe\u2019d gotten into Blueriver Sword Manor on account of family connections, so he could go register whenever he wanted.Su Yi said no more. He just followed his memories from back then and walked towards the southwest part of the city.Halfway there, an exquisitely decorated carriage suddenly rolled to a stop beside Su Yi.\u00a0The curtains opened, revealing a beautiful face quick to smile, but also quick to anger.Her hair looked soft as clouds, and it was bound up in an angled phoenix hairpin. Her eyes shone, bright as twin full moons save for her pitch-black pupils. Her lustrous skin looked as delicate as suet, as if you could break it just by blowing on it. Her bright eyes darted about, her gaze tender and alluring. In short, she was deeply and utterly charming.Huang Qianjun was dazed.\u00a0Isn\u2019t she a bit too alluring?The woman\u2019s lips parted slightly, and she said in a gentle voice reminiscent of flute music, \u201cMight I ask if you are Young Lord Su Yi?\u201dSu Yi nodded thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019re the songstress of the Garden of Blossoms, Cha Jin, right?\u201dSurprise flashed through the woman\u2019s eyes, then she smiled faintly. \u201cYou recognized me. What did I do to deserve such fortune?\u201dAnother man would have long since become intoxicated by her limitless charm, but Su Yi just said calmly, \u201cMight I ask why you\u2019ve sought me out?\u201dCha Jin bit her red lips, her bright eyes shining like water as she said solemnly, \u201cYoung Lord Su, please don\u2019t misunderstand. I just heard about what happened on the tower ship. You were the one who turned the tides and averted a crisis that might otherwise have impacted everyone on board. That\u2019s why, when I passed through here and recognized you, I couldn\u2019t help but stop to express my gratitude in person.\u201dIt was obvious that she wasn\u2019t even twenty yet, but her every movement, down to the slightest frown or subtlest smile, was charming and amorous. Just watching, Huang Qianjun already felt his heart shaking.\u201cOh,\u201d said Su Yi. He stared intently at her and said, \u201cNo need for thanks. I\u2019ll be happy so long as you don\u2019t assume I\u2019m allied with his Sixth Highness.\u201dCha Jin\u2019s pretty face froze, and her pupils subtly constricted. Then, she pressed her lips into a smile. \u201cI shan't disturb you any longer. I bid you farewell.\u201dWith that, she closed the curtains, and her luxurious carriage drove off into the distance.Huang Qianjun watched until the carriage stopped before a charming, antique building. His eyes lit up. \u201cDoes Cha Jin plan to do business at the \u2018Sand-Scouring Waves\u2019? Brother Su\u2026. Huh?\u201dWhen he turned, he saw that Su Yi was far away, and he hurried after him.\u201cBrother Su, that Cha Jin went into the Sand-Scouring Waves. That\u2019s the most famous brothel in the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital. They say, there, \u2018beauties are as common as the clouds\u2019 and that \u2018for a thousand gold, you can have a beautiful dream!\u2019\u201d Huang Qianjun was so excited, he was rubbing his hands together.Then, he asked tentatively, \u201cBrother Su, how about we scrounge up some free time and go check it out?\u201dAs soon as he said this, he felt the urge to slap himself.\u00a0What nonsense! How could I suggest such a thing to an \u2018immortal sent to the mundane realm\u2019 like Brother Su? What if he misunderstands?But Su Yi didn\u2019t seem to care in the least. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good about a place on that level.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Huang Qianjun inwardly sighed in relief, but at the same time, he was stunned. As he pondered, his thoughts took on a rather different flavor.Nothing good?It\u2019s true that aside from a few artful courtesans, no one in a brothel \u2018treats their body like a temple.\u2019\u00a0Looking at it that way, Brother Su actually understands the situation quite well!This thought immediately put an ambiguous smile on Huang Qianjun\u2019s face. Su Yi would never have guessed that Huang Qianjun\u2019s imagination ran wild so easily. Had he known, he might very well have split Huang Qianjun\u2019s head open like a melon and shouted, \u201cJust what do you spend all day thinking about!??\u201d\u2026\u2026The southwestern district.Willow Alley was all short, ramshackle mud huts. The ground was pitted and uneven, and it looked like it had rained recently, as the road was nothing but mud.This was indeed the slum Cheng Wuyong described. Everyone who lived here was on the lowest rungs of society.It was desolation as far as the eye could see.Compared to the rest of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, it was like an entirely different world.Su Yi led Huang Qianjun down this familiar path. Perhaps because their clothes were relatively clean and neat, they attracted numerous people\u2019s attention.\u201cYoung Lord, please give me a bit of money, just a little. My child has gone hungry for days.\u201dA bony woman threw herself to the ground and wept, drenching her whole body in muddy water.Huang Qianjun couldn\u2019t bear the sight of her. He was just about to fish out his wallet when Su Yi stopped him.\u201cIf you take your money out now, in an instant, a whole group of beggars will swarm you. You won\u2019t be able to leave until you\u2019ve given up everything you have on you.\u201dHuang Qianjun\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWith our power, don\u2019t tell me a bunch of beggars can stop us?\u201d\u201cWith your status, could you bear to hurt them?\u201d Su Yi asked right back. \u201cThey have no money, which means they can\u2019t afford medical treatment. If they get injured, they\u2019ll have no choice but to wait for death.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d Huang Qianjun hesitated.\u201cWe\u2019re friends with Feng Xiaofeng.\u201d Su Yi glanced at the bowing woman. \u201cIf your child is dying of hunger, you can take them to visit him.\u201dThe woman was briefly stunned. Then, she nimbly crawled to her feet, cursed, and left. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier? I threw myself into the mud for nothing!\u201d\u201cThat really worked?\u201d Huang Qianjun barely dared believe his eyes.\u201cIn order to survive, the bottom rungs of society have little choice but to huddle together for warmth. If you recognize even one of them, the others will no longer see you as a \u2018lost, fatty lamb ready for slaughter.\u2019\u201d As Su Yi spoke, he continued ahead.Huang Qianjun hurriedly caught up to him. \u201cBrother Su, who is Feng Xiaofeng?\u201d\u201cA friend.\u201d As Su Yi spoke these words, his eyes flashed a hint of emotion.To the person he\u2019d been before awakening his memories, the word \u201cfriend\u201d was far more important than any treasure.\u00a0Feng Xiaofeng was one of the few friends he had to his name.Finally, when they\u2019d traveled deep into the alleyway, Su Yi stopped before a run-down courtyard.The residence\u2019s four walls were short and made of mud, and they\u2019d been damaged a long time ago. The gate was flecked with rust. Just standing there, you could easily see into the courtyard\u2019s interior.When they scanned the area, they saw three mud and tile huts, a vegetable garden, a willow tree, and six or seven ducks and chickens.A gaunt figure sat in a wooden wheelchair. His coarse clothes were worn, and he was currently cooking over a fire.Smoke billowed from the firepit, obscuring his figure. From time to time, he coughed violently.When Su Yi saw this, his gaze was suddenly a bit more focused and grave. \u201cYou wait here.\u201dWith that, he pushed open the door and entered the courtyard.\u201cXiaoran, are you back? Go review your lessons. I\u2019ll finish dinner right away,\u201d said the gaunt figure in the wheelchair.But then, he realized something wasn\u2019t quite right. He looked up and saw a tall, lean figure standing before him.When he saw this unexpected guest\u2019s face, the man in the wheelchair was initially stunned. Then, his face lit up with excitement and delight. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su Yi! What are you doing here?\u201dHe reached for his cane and was about to rise, only for Su Yi to push him back down. \u201cI just arrived in the prefectural capital. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that after just a year apart, you\u2019d wind up like this.\u201dHis expression was complicated.The gaunt figure before him was indeed Feng Xiaofeng, but he was starkly different from the resolute, strong, and masculine youth he remembered.His hair was in disarray, and his clothes were old and full of holes. He was bony, and his skin was dull. His face ought to have been that of a high-spirited youth, but instead, it was tinged with hardship.Worst of all, both of his legs were obviously crippled, so he could only sit in a wheelchair.Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s delight gradually faded, and he fell temporarily silent before forcing a smile. \u201cThis is good too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good at all.\u201d\u00a0Su Yi\u2019s gaze swept across the ruined courtyard before finally landing on the pot hanging over the firepit.Despite all that steam and smoke, there was only a pathetically sparse handful of rice bran at the very bottom.Su Yi\u2019s spirits sank.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, the past is in the past. I\u2019m a cripple now. I might live a simple life in poverty, but I\u2019m getting by,\u201d said Feng Xiaofeng. He looked up and said seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t need your pity, nor do I need your help. I\u2019m just happy that you came to see me.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not happy.\u201d Su Yi patted Feng Xiaofeng on the shoulder. \u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about. You\u2019re afraid that I\u2019ll go avenge you, but that as soon as I appear, the people who bullied us back then will hurt me instead.\u201dAs he said this, Su Yi laughed, his gaze profound, inscrutable, and cold. \u201cBut you most likely haven\u2019t guessed that I came here precisely to resolve old grudges and rid myself of years of accumulated resentment!\u201d\u201cYou want revenge?\u201d Feng Xiaofeng exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve already recovered my cultivation.\u201d Su Yi nodded. Inwardly, he added,\u00a0And I\u2019m different than I once was. I won\u2019t just get revenge; I can even help your crippled legs recover!Feng Xiaofeng shouted in delight, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely wonderful news! Hahahaha\u2026.!\u201dBut as he laughed, tears gathered at the corners of his eyes. He suddenly took several deep breaths, fighting back the tears before they could fall. Soon, they vanished without a trace.Men had tears, but they didn\u2019t shed them easily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Moved to KillFeng Xiaofeng rubbed his eyes, then mocked himself, \u201cI haven\u2019t been so happy in a long time. I actually lost control a little.\u201dBut then, he shook his head. \u201cBrother Su, I still advise you against seeking revenge. Even if your cultivation has recovered, those guys\u2019 backgrounds are too prominent, and this is the prefectural capital, their home turf! It\u2019s too dangerous!\u201dHe took a deep breath, then looked up at Su Yi. \u201cWhen a gentleman takes his revenge, ten years isn\u2019t too long to wait. With your talent, you\u2019re certain to become a Martial Dao Grandmaster one day. You can get your revenge then.\u201dSu Yi just smiled. \u201cXiaofeng, I dared come all this way. I naturally am confident that I can settle all of our grudges. Besides, I\u2019m no gentleman; I can\u2019t wait that long.\u201dFeng Xiaofeng fell silent, then said bitterly, \u201cBut I\u2026. I can no longer help you\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou helped me many times over back in Blueriver Sword Manor,\u201d said Su Yi gently. \u201cThis time, you can leave it up to me.\u201dHe paused, then continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here because I needed your help, but because I owe you far too much. If I don\u2019t repay you, my heart will remain unsettled.\u201dFeng Xiaofeng sighed. \u201cWhat happened then isn\u2019t even worth mentioning. I\u2019m surprised you even remember.\u201d\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d Su Yi put his hands behind his back and thought back to the past. \u201cIt was autumn of the 396th year of the Great Zhou Dynasty. I was just fourteen years old, and it had only been two months since I began my cultivation in Blueriver Sword Manor.\u201cIt was the first day of the eleventh lunar month. I had just received my allotment of three bottles of pills and ten spirit stones, and I was on my way back when Jing Hu and his cronies surrounded me. He wanted to force me to give up my pills and spirit stones.\u201cI naturally refused, so all of them ganged up on me and beat me. I fell to the ground, covered in blood.\u00a0Many other outer sect disciples saw this, but out of fear of Jing Hu and the others\u2019 fury, no one dared step forth to rescue me.\u201cOnly you, some punk kid with no fear of death, charged in like a fool and tried to carry me off for treatment, only for Jing Hu and his cronies to beat you too. Your injuries wound up being even worse than mine. In the end, as soon as I recovered enough to move, I had to carry you back instead.\u201dWhen Feng Xiaofeng heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t been young once? I was really pure-hearted then, and compassionate too. I witnessed an injustice, so I had to do something. Even though I got a beating for my troubles, I don\u2019t regret it even now.\u201dSu Yi laughed. \u201cAfterward, we fellow sufferers became brothers. We endured so many rolled eyes, jeers, barbed words, and attacks, but we endured them together. Without you, I\u2019m not sure I could have held out.\u201dFeng Xiaofeng sighed wistfully too.\u201cWhen I became the Outer Sect Sword Chief, I thought that after I made it into the inner sect, I\u2019d pull you in after me. Who\u2019d\u2019ve thought\u2026.\u201d Su Yi trailed off, his expression a little strange. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought I\u2019d become the cast-off disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor and a live-in son-in-law?\u201dHe turned to Feng Xiaofeng and said, \u201cBut I\u2019m even more surprised to see you like this. Unless\u00a0I mistake\u00a0my guess, it was Yunqiao who did it, right?\u201dFeng Xiaofeng\u2019s expression changed, and his gaze darkened as he said bitterly, \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t keep it from you.\u201dSu Yi\u2019s tone was calm and indifferent. \u201cHe took both your legs. I\u2019ll make him pay with his life!\u201dFeng Xiaofeng was immediately frantic. He opened his mouth and was about to say something when Su Yi laughed and cut him off. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely about to tell me that Nian Yunqiao has the Nian Family behind him, and that they\u2019re enormously powerful, so I shouldn\u2019t be reckless. Right?\u201dFeng Xiaofeng sighed. \u201cYou already know, so why are you stubborn?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t called \u2018stubbornness,\u2019\u201d said Su Yi, but before he could elaborate, someone cried out from beyond the courtyard gates.\u201cBig Brother Xiaofeng, the Black Tiger Gang kidnapped Xiaoran!\u201d A sallow-faced, skinny young man rushed inside, looking completely frantic. \u201cBig Brother Xiaofeng, what are we going to do? Xiaoran has already fallen into the Black Tiger Gang\u2019s hands! They\u2019re sure to sell her to some brothel!\u201dFeng Xiaoran\u2019s expression changed dramatically, as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning.Xiaoran was his little sister, and she was only thirteen years old!His chest heaved, and his eyes went red. He gnashed his teeth, saying, \u201cA-Fei, where did you see them take her?\u201dThe youth he called A-Fei said, \u201cOver by Budding Spring Alley, but I suspect they\u2019ve already taken her back to their base.\u201d\u201cDo you know where the Black Tiger Gang\u2019s lair is?\u201d Su Yi followed up. He couldn\u2019t help but recall the image of a young girl. Her floral-print clothes were old and tattered, and she had two little pigtails, like sheep horns. Her eyes were big and bright, and she was clever and adorable.During his time cultivating at Blueriver Sword Manor, Su Yi visited Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s family home on numerous occasions. He naturally knew that Feng Xiaofeng doted on his little sister.\u201cI know!\u201d A-Fei hurriedly nodded.Su Yi patted Feng Xiaofeng on the shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t panic. You stay here; I\u2019ll bring Xiaoran home.\u201dHis tone was casual, but his words left Feng Xiaofeng overwrought. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, this time\u2026 I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll really have to trouble you.\u201d\u201cA-Fei, lead the way.\u201d Su Yi wasted no time. He simply walked right out of the courtyard.A-Fei hurried after him. When he stepped outside, Su Yi glanced at Huang Qianjun, who\u2019d been waiting outside. \u201cYou stay here just in case.\u201dHuang Qianjun hurriedly agreed.\u201cShe\u2019d better be alright. If something happens to that girl, I\u2019ll\u2026.\u201d Murderous intent coursed through Su Yi\u2019s heart, and his calm gaze frosted over.It was the first time since reawakening his memories that he truly felt murderous, for no other reason except that this time, he really cared.\u2026\u2026Where there was light, there was inevitably darkness as well.The Cloudriver Prefectural Capital was bustling and prosperous, but it was its very prosperity that gave rise to numerous underground organizations.The Black Tiger Gang was just one of them.This particular faction made their living selling women. Their methods were debased and despicable.But they were smart, too: the girls they sold all came from the lowest rungs of society, from the poorest families, those without backers or influence. Such families naturally had no means of getting revenge.Spring Jade Alley, the lair of the Black Tiger Gang.The gang occupied the entire area, so under ordinary circumstances, none dared draw near.The skies blazed like fire, the blood-colored sun setting slowly disappearing over the horizon.\u201cBig Bro, that alleyway in the distance is Spring Jade Alley, but I\u2026. I don\u2019t dare go any closer.\u201d A-Fei stopped when they were still far away, his young face filled with unconcealed terror.Su Yi nodded, then proceeded ahead on his own. He carried his bamboo staff, and although his gait looked unhurried, he was moving quickly. Beneath the light of the setting sun, his tall, lean frame cast elongated shadows.A-Fei initially planned to just turn and leave, but he hesitated, gnashed his teeth, then stayed put. Instead of fleeing, he hid himself in a corner beside a wall.\u201cYoung Lord, what are you here for?\u201d As Su Yi drew closer to Spring Jade Alley, two stalwart men rose within the darkness. They looked Su Yi up and down, and when they saw how he was dressed, their cold words were still somewhat polite.\u201cWhere\u2019s the little girl you people just kidnapped?\u201d said Su Yi, gazing further down the alleyway.Night had fallen, and lanterns hung from the buildings. He could vaguely discern the sound of distant partying and revelry.One of the men was instantly on guard. \u201cWhat little girl? Young Lord, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in the wrong place. We\u2019re well-behaved, law-abiding citizens who keep to ourselves.\u201dThe other frowned. \u201cI advise you to get out of here right now. Or else, you\u2019d best be careful you don\u2019t \u2018trip and fall\u2019 in the darkness!\u201dSu Yi\u2019s thumb shifted, and Mortal Edge popped from its sheath with a clang. He then stabbed without so much as a second look.A streak of cold radiance burst like starlight.Splurt! Splurt!Both men\u2019s eyes widened as blood coursed from the new holes in their throats. Their lips quivered, but they couldn\u2019t speak.Shortly after, both of them thudded to the ground.Su Yi then proceeded further down the dimly lit alleyway, completely at ease.A-Fei was watching from a distance, and when he saw this, he was so stunned, he almost screamed. Fortunately, he clamped his hands over his mouth in time.Even so, waves of shock coursed through his heart.\u00a0Is\u2026 Is this the power of a martial artist?At the end of the alley.Su Yi stopped before a courtyard gate of blue-grey brick and black tile. Large lanterns hung from the gates, and their mottled, orange radiance dispersed the darkness.\u00a0Two Black Tiger Gang guards stood by the red-lacquered gate, whispering amongst themselves. From time to time, they laughed obscene, ambiguous laughter.Suddenly, they saw a tall figure walking through the darkness.\u201cWho are you?\u201d One of them asked instinctively. The figure was only partially visible beneath the mottled lamplight, his handsome features indistinct, save for that cold, inscrutable gaze.Those eyes merely swept across them, but both guard guards felt chills course down their spines, and they shuddered involuntarily.Afterward, there was a sharp flash of sword light.Both guards felt sharp pain in their throats. Then, awareness left them, and they thudded limply to the ground.Su Yi didn\u2019t even look at them. He simply pushed open the gates and walked inside.There was a lively banquet within the courtyard, with five or six tables and at least twenty members of the black Tiger Gang drinking, shouting, laughing, and carousing. The sound of clinking glasses filled the air. In\u00a0a shadowed corner, some were even brazenly going enjoying each other\u2019s bodies. It wasn\u2019t just one couple, either.The scene was downright foul; there was no better way to describe it.Surprisingly, when Su Yi walked in, he didn\u2019t attract much attention.\u201cWho are you? Why haven\u2019t I seen you before?\u201d A man pulled up his pants and emerged from the corner. His breath reeked of booze; he was obviously intoxicated.A red-faced, half-dressed, flirtatious woman trailed after him.The man looked Su Yi up and down and barked drunkenly, \u201cI asked you a question! Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201dSu Yi glanced at him.\u00a0It was just one look, but the man trembled from head to toe, as if he\u2019d plunged into an icy abyss. His intoxication faded somewhat.Su Yi asked, \u201cTell me: where do you usually imprison the girls you kidnap?\u201d\u201cIn\u2026 In the dungeons,\u201d the man stuttered. He didn\u2019t know why, but he was incomparably terrified, like an ant being interrogated by a god.\u201cAnd where are the dungeons?\u201dThe man pointed toward the main atrium beyond the courtyard, his finger trembling.\u00a0He was just about to say something when\u2026Splurt!With a flash of metal, Mortal Edge went right through his throat.\u201cBig Brother Yong, I still want more\u2026\u201d The flirtatious woman had yet to realize something was amiss. She winked seductively, searing desire written all over her face. She walked up and tried to snuggle up against the man, only for blood to gush from his throat and splatter all over her face.She froze, then shrieked. \u201cAh\u2014! Murder! Murder!\u201dThe sound of her terrified voice cut through the night sky.The lively atmosphere came to a sudden standstill. Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked toward the shrieking woman.They then saw the figure lying beside her in a puddle of blood, and their expressions changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - When You Grow UpTheir shock only lasted a moment. The Black Tiger Gang members reacted quickly, and all of them locked onto their target: the blue-robed youth headed toward the main atrium!\u201cBrothers, seize him! Cut him up!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d There was a sudden commotion as the gang members seemingly transformed into malevolent gods. They raised their weapons, shouted, and charged at Su Yi.Perhaps this was simply because they\u2019d already had too much to drink, but every last one of them was ready and raring to go. They charged ahead without fear.But Su Yi was as calm as ever, as if he didn\u2019t even see them.He didn\u2019t so much as turn around to look at them. Mortal Edge let out a clear hum, and in an instant, sharp sword shadows shot out like lightning, one after another. Illusory blades crossed and overlapped, covering the entire area.The villains of the Black Tiger Gang were a motley crowd. At best, they knew a few coarse fist techniques or crude kicks. They\u2019d yet to so much as brush up against the threshold of the Martial Dao.How could they possibly be a match for Su Yi?In an instant, corpses lay scattered across the ground, fresh blood gathering into puddles, the red stark and eye-catching beneath the lamplight.Those Su Yi hadn\u2019t killed were scared out of their wits. They fled as far as they could, their faces ashen, the hands holding their weapons shaking uncontrollably.But Su Yi paid these small fries no further head. He just carried his sword and strode into the atrium.Wham!A halberd swung at him with dazzling, cold light.The attacker was a one-eyed middle-aged man clad in black. He\u2019d been hiding beside the doorway, but now, he struck explosively. He\u2019d seized the opportune moment with practiced ruthlessness.But it was as if Su Yi had precognition; he shifted subtly to the side, and the halberd hit nothing but air.Splurt!At the same time, Mortal Edge smoothly cleaved the one-eyed man\u2019s neck. His sizable head went flying, and his now headless body sprayed fresh blood before thudding to the ground.The hall was illuminated by candles and empty save for a single table, which was covered in a sumptuous feast. The delicacies were still piping hot, but the guests had already vacated their chairs.When Su Yi entered, he saw three people nearby: a man, a woman, and an elder. All of them clutched weapons, their expressions grave, unsightly, and completely on guard.The man said in a low voice, \u201cFriend, every injustice has its perpetrator, and every debt has its creditor. If we\u2019ve offended you in some way, I, \u2018Ol\u2019 Qing\u2019 will compensate you. Might I ask why you\u2019re doing this and see if we can smooth things over?\u201dSu Yi\u2019s gaze swept around the room. \u201cWhere is the entrance to the dungeon?\u201dThe man\u2019s heart shook, and he couldn\u2019t help but blurt, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me those blind subordinates of mine captured a friend of yours?\u201dSplurt!Su Yi suddenly strode forward, and his sword flashed like lightning, effortlessly penetrating the man\u2019s throat. In the last moments before his death, the man\u2019s astonishment was written all over his face.\u201cYou answer instead.\u201d Su Yi turned toward the woman.She was already so scared that her legs were quivering. Her face was as pretty as a flower, but it was now pale with fright. When she heard Su Yi\u2019s questions, she instinctively glanced at the screen door on the side of the room.Splurt!There was another flash of sword light.Blood sprayed from the woman\u2019s throat, and her body sprawled out on the ground. Her eyes were still open; she found no peace even in death.\u201cWe already told you,\u201d shouted the elder, the only one who remained. \u201cWhy did you have to kill her?\u201dHe was so scared, it was as if he\u2019d lost his soul, and his mind was on the verge of collapse.The only answer he got was the sharp edge of a sword.Splurt!His whole body split right down the midline, falling to the sides in two perfect halves, his blood and organs spilling out like a waterfall.\u201cDo I need a reason to kill you?\u201d said Su Yi. He turned towards the screen door. His gaze was calm as ever, his eyes indifferent and inscrutable. When Su Xuanjun killed in anger, he disdained offering explanations.There was another wall behind the screen, with a hidden gate cut into it.Su Yi swung his sword and cleaved open the lock, then pushed the door open and entered without delay.\u2026\u2026Feng Xiaoran crouched in the damp darkness of the dungeons, hugging her knees tight.Her hair was in disarray, and although her face was pallid, she showed no signs of panic. On the contrary, she was perfectly calm.The moment she was kidnapped, she knew that she was doomed to live out the rest of her days mired in darkness. She would never live freely beneath the sunlight ever again.She\u2019d long since heard that the girls the Black Tiger Gang kidnapped were sold to brothels to spend the rest of their lives as men\u2019s toys, enduring all kinds of humiliation, their lives no longer their own.But she wasn\u2019t afraid.She would never give up on any hope of staying alive.\u00a0So long as she was alive, she\u2019d use every method at her disposal to grow strong!Big Brother, please rest assured. I\u2019ll live, and live well, and one day\u2026 It will be my turn to protect you!\u00a0Feng Xiaoran said in her heart.She could give up everything she had, with one exception. She just couldn\u2019t let go of her older brother, Feng Xiaofeng.This was the source of her deep determination to survive.Suddenly, the sound of footsteps echoed through the darkness, gradually drawing closer and closer.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally come for me?\u201d Feng Xiaoran raised her pretty head to see who this new arrival was. Despite the darkness, she wanted to commit her kidnapper\u2019s face to memory so that one day, she could get her revenge!But the dungeons were so dark that despite her best efforts, all she saw was a tall, blurry silhouette.The figure then crouched, and his bright, deep gaze entered her field of view. She could even see his eyes filling with relief.Her heart shook, and she suddenly felt that in all her years of life, those eyes were the brightest, most beautiful things she\u2019d ever seen. They were like sunlight on a spring morning, washing over her and warming the icy darkness that had taken hold of her heart.\u201cDo you still remember me?\u201d said a friendly voice carrying a hint of laughter.Feng Xiaoran instantly trembled. She suddenly saw the handsome face of the person crouched nearby clearly.\u201cBig Brother Su Yi?\u201d Her eyes widened. She was bewildered; she almost felt as if she were dreaming.A familiar face had come for her while she was in captivity. The moment he arrived, it was as if endless light appeared to chase away the darkness.The contrast was so stark, she almost couldn\u2019t keep up.A little while later, Feng Xiaoran broke into a radiant smile. \u201cBig Brother Su Yi, you\u2019re here to rescue me!\u201dSu Yi tousled her hair, then picked her up and carried her on his back. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m going to take you home.\u201d\u201cMm!\u201d Feng Xioran nodded firmly, then wrapped her arms tightly around Su Yi\u2019s neck, as if afraid that this sudden good fortune would slip right back through her fingers.When he sensed the force the girl exerted through those tender, thin arms, Su Yi\u2019s spirits sank.\u00a0How much helplessness and despair must she have felt during her time in the dungeon?\u201cYou all can go home too.\u201d Su Yi turned toward the other figures huddled in the darkness. Most were girls in their teens.With that, he turned, left the dungeons, and returned to the atrium. With each step, he moved closer to the courtyard.\u201cXiaoran, close your eyes,\u201d whispered Su Yi.\u00a0The air was rife with the smell of bloodshed, and corpses littered the ground. It was an extremely unsettling sight.But Feng Xiaoran shook her head and only opened her eyes wider. She solemnly took in the carnage, and although her little face was pale, she was completely calm.\u00a0She wasn\u2019t the least bit scared. On the contrary, she felt absolutely amazing.When they left the residence and returned to Spring Jade Alley, she suddenly said, \u201cBig Brother Su Yi, teach me to cultivate the Martial Dao, okay?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to cultivate?\u201d asked Su Yi.Feng Xiaoran hesitated to tell him, but in the end, she still said it. \u201cI want to protect my big brother. I want to protect him for the rest of our lives. I won\u2019t let anyone bully him ever again.\u201dHer bright, crystal-clear eyes looked uncertain. \u201cHalf a year ago, a bad man broke my brother\u2019s legs, severing his Martial Dao. He never says it out loud, but I know he\u2019s suffering deeply inside.\u201cWhen my brother and I were still little, our mom ran off with some wild man. It was our father who raised us, but half a year ago, after learning that Big Brother was crippled, he couldn\u2019t take the shock. He got sick, and in less than a week, he was dead.\u201cEver since, my brother has been the only relative I have left in this world\u2026.\u201dWhen she said this, her pale face was utterly grim. Then, she took a deep breath and said with calm determination, \u201cIt was also then that I told myself, no matter what, I have to become strong! No matter the price, no matter how much humiliation and mockery I have to endure, if it means I can protect my big brother, I won\u2019t back down!\u201dSu Yi listened in silence. He felt sorry for her, and he sighed to himself, but he also felt something he couldn\u2019t quite put into words.He had known for a long time that Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s family was desperately poor. It was practically a miracle that he\u2019d made it into Blueriver Sword Manor to cultivate at all.But he never would have guessed that his friend\u2019s road had been so bumpy.Feng Xiaofeng and his sister relied on each other to stay alive. Feng Xiaoran was just thirteen years old, but her temperament and maturity were far beyond others her age. This was beyond Su Yi\u2019s expectations.Su Yi deeply understood Feng Xiaoran\u2019s feelings.When he left home at fourteen, traversing mountains and wastes all on his own to cultivate in Blueriver Sword Manor, wasn\u2019t he trying to use martial arts to change his destiny too?\u00a0Only those who\u2019d experienced darkness would fight tooth and nail to seize a ray of light and change their fates.When they left the alleyway, Su Yi said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to learn, I\u2019ll personally teach you the secrets of cultivation.\u201dA broad smile instantly spread across Feng Xiaoran\u2019s face. \u201cBig Brother Su Yi, did you know? I\u2019ll never, ever forget that moment you first appeared. One day\u2026 I\u2019ll have to repay you!\u201dSu Yi smiled. \u201cAll I want is for you and your brother to live well. That\u2019s the best reward you could possibly give me.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 How about I marry you when I get older?\u201d said Feng Xiaoran, and she sounded serious.Su Yi froze, then couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWe can talk after you grow up.\u201dA thirteen-year-old girl had, while trying to express her gratitude, chosen her words poorly. She probably didn\u2019t even understand what it meant to marry someone.But then, that was understandable.Feng Xiaoran laughed too, and her big eyes squinted, like luminous crescent moons. She said nothing, but in her heart, she thought,\u00a0Big Brother Su Yi, when I grow up, you\u2019d better not go back on your word\u2026.Beneath the darkness, the young woman\u2019s pallid face was utterly serious and expectant.She might be young, but she was already blossoming into a woman. Her eyebrows were dark, her nose straight and well-formed. She was slender, with skin as fair and delicate as cream.Especially her eyes. They were currently slightly sunken, but they were bright and profound, and they glittered like precious stones. When she smiled, they were like moons reflected against the lake, pretty as could be.She was still young, but it was already obvious that she was a picturesque beauty in the making.But her disheveled hair was slightly dry, her clothes were worn and covered in patches, and her sleeves were frayed. All of this revealed that she was born into poverty.She was still young, but she already showed signs of the kind of peerless charm that would one day topple cities.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - The Purple Jade Token, Madam Cuiyun\u201cBrother Su, you\u2019re amazing! You really brought Xiaoran back\u00a0safe!\u201d A-Fei dashed over from not far away, shouting in delight.\u00a0He\u2019d been waiting nervously this entire time, completely on edge. When he saw Su Yi carrying Feng Xiaoran, he was overcome with joy.\u201cCome on,\u201d Su Yi patted the young man on the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201dDeep in Willow Alley.Here, the night seemed dreary. The only lights were scattered lamps shining from within the residences. Fortunately, the moon hung overhead, its light accompanying them on their journey. Otherwise, Su Yi and company likely would have struggled to find their way back in the darkness.A campfire blazed beside a dilapidated residence built of mud.\u00a0Feng Xiaofeng sat in his wooden wheelchair, anxiously waiting.\u201cYou can relax,\u201d said Huang Qianjun. \u201cBrother Su went personally, so you have nothing to fear.\u201dHe crouched by the campfire and said offhandedly, \u201cYou might not believe me, but I\u2019d bet my life on it. If Brother Su goes all out, he can kill Martial Dao Grandmasters as easily as if they were chickens. It won\u2019t even tire him out\u201dFeng Xiaofeng sighed. \u201cI sure hope so.\u201dHe naturally didn\u2019t believe a word of it; he just assumed Huang Qianjun was trying to comfort him. \u201cBrother Huang, how did you and Su Yi meet?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Huang Qianjun scratched his head awkwardly. \u201cTo tell you the truth, it\u2019s a bit embarrassing. Hm\u2026. How do I put it? Back then, you could call me a prominent figure of Guangling City\u2019s younger generation. I wasn\u2019t necessarily a household name, but I was still famed throughout the area, so I thought rather highly of myself\u2026.\u201dHe stopped to compliment himself before getting to the point. He then told Feng Xiaofeng of his initial clash with Su Yi, but he made it sound like a clash of heroes who only bonded after duking it out\u2026Feng Xiaofeng didn\u2019t doubt a word of it. The story left him totally transfixed.When Huang Qianjun reached the part about Su Yi\u2019s shocking performance and complete domination of the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s blood surged, and his eyes sparkled.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su Yi really lives up to the name \u2018Outer Sect Sword Chief\u2019. He fell back into mortal dust, but he didn\u2019t lose his ambition, and now that he\u2019s stepped back into the Martial Dao, he shines brighter than ever!\u201dBut then, Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s spirits sank.Both of his legs were crippled. His cultivation might as well have been crippled too. It would be hard for him to imitate Su Yi and step back onto the Martial Dao\u2026.\u201cBro, don\u2019t get discouraged. What\u00a0is the Martial\u00a0Dao? It\u2019s a power that ordinary people cannot wield. It\u2019s seizing fortune from the heavens and transforming the old and rotten into treasure!\u201d When Huang Qianjun sensed Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s despondency, he hurriedly tried to comfort him.\u201cYou ought to know that this world includes Xiantian Martial Ancestors, as well as the even more incredible Earthly Immortals. They\u2019ve surely mastered the art of reviving the dead and restoring flesh to bone. For them, fixing your legs will be as easy as turning over their hands.\u201d\u201cReviving the dead and restoring flesh to bone?\u201d Feng Xiaofeng muttered to himself. \u201cBut how could a cripple like me dare covet a miraculous art like that?\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you covet it?\u201d A burst of sudden laughter filled the courtyard.Feng Xiaoran\u2019s head shot up, and he immediately saw Su Yi carrying Feng Xiaoran. He and A-Fei pushed the door open and walked inside.Feng Xiaofeng felt as if he\u2019d set down the massive boulder weighing on his heart. Every inch of him relaxed as he said emotionally, \u201cXiaoran, you\u2019re not hurt, are you?\u201d\u201cBig Brother, I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m not hurt at all!\u201d Feng Xiaoran replied, her voice lively and crisp.As if to prove her point, she jumped from Su Yi\u2019s back and stretched her slender body. \u201cSee? I\u2019m completely fine!\u201dThe rims of Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s eyes reddened, and he said in a trembling voice. \u201cGood. Wonderful! Senior Apprentice Brother Su\u2026.\u201dHe reached for his cane and was struggling to rise and express his gratitude when Su Yi shook his head and pressed him back down into his chair. \u201cWe weren\u2019t so polite with each other when we cultivated together in Blueriver Sword Manor. It wasn\u2019t that way then, and it won\u2019t be that way going forward.\u201dFeng Xiaofeng grinned. \u201cAs you say!\u201d\u201cBrother Xiaofeng, everything\u2019s settled, so I\u2019m going back home to eat,\u201d said A-Fei from the side.\u201cDon\u2019t go yet. Let\u2019s have dinner together first,\u201d said Su Yi.When A-Fei brought up food, Su Yi realized that he was a bit hungry too.There was nothing for it; those who cultivated the Martial Dao needed to supplement their bodies with vast quantities of food on a daily basis. Only then could they satisfy the needs of their vital energy.Once they stepped into the Origin Dao, they could abstain from food and subsist entirely on sunlight and morning dew.\u201cOkay! Then let\u2019s go to the House of Prosperity!\u201d Huang Qianjun rubbed his hands together; he was ravenous too!\u201cThe House of Prosperity?\u201d A-Fei was stunned. \u201cThat\u2026. Isn\u2019t that a place only the upper class can afford to dine in? A single dish costs over a hundred taels of silver. That\u2019s years of my family\u2019s income!\u201dHuang Qianjun burst into laughter. \u201cHahaha, I\u2019ll ensure you eat to your heart\u2019s content, my treat!\u201dAlthough this delinquent young master was in many ways ignorant and incompetent, he\u2019d fully mastered the illustrious arts of drinking, fine-dining, brothel-frequenting, and gambling.Feng Xiaofeng said hurriedly, \u201cThat place is too expensive. How about we\u2026.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Su Yi gave him no chance to refuse. He just pushed his friend\u2019s chair outside. At the same time, he ordered Huang Qianjun, \u201cGo arrange for a carriage.\u201dHuang Qianjun briefly voiced his assent, then dashed off to do as he was told. He was delighted;\u00a0It\u2019s finally my turn to shine\u2026.!\u201cXiaoran, A-Fei, you two follow me,\u201d ordered Su Yi.Both of them agreed, then stuck to Su Yi like glue.When they arrived at Spring Jade Alley, they saw a spacious, ornate, horse-drawn carriage waiting for them. Its driver was none other than Huang Qianjun.\u201cEveryone, please get on board. I\u2019ll be your driver for the night, said Huang Qianjun gleefully.A-Fei couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cBig Brother Huang, are you some kind of conjurer? How did you rustle up a horse-drawn carriage so quickly?\u201dHuang Qianjun said lightly, even dismissively, \u201cLittle fellow, remember this: in this world, problems you can resolve with money can\u2019t even be called problems.\u201dOnce he saw that everyone was on board, Huang Qianjun shook the reins like an experienced driver. \u201cEveryone, sit tight! Let\u2019s ride!\u201d\u2026\u2026The House of Prosperity.It was located in a prosperous strip of the prefectural capital\u2019s eastern district. It was famed as the city\u2019s top money pit; its guests were all either wealthy or noble.Night had just fallen, and the lanterns were freshly lit.All nine floors of the House of Prosperity were well-lit, and neatly-dressed servants were there to greet and see off guests. All of them had perfect manners.\u201cI apologize, but I\u2019m afraid none of our private dining rooms are currently available,\u201d said the servant with a bow when he saw Su Yi\u2019s group draw near. \u201cWould you like to wait? Or would you prefer to try another restaurant?\u201dHuang Qianjun snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t even try this trick. Do you really think I don\u2019t know that the House of Prosperity always leaves a portion of its private dining rooms open just in case?\u201dThe servant was briefly stunned. Then he explained, \u201cYoung Lord, if you know that, then you surely know that those empty private rooms are only\u00a0opened\u00a0for our most distinguished guests.\u201dHis attitude wasn\u2019t exactly bad, and he was perfectly polite.But when his gaze swept across Feng Xiaofeng, Feng Xiaoran, and A-Fei, his expression went a little strange.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that our status is insufficient to dine here?\u201d Huang Qianjun was a bit angry.The servant smiled bitterly. \u201cYoung Lord, please don\u2019t put it like that. I\u2019m but a humble servant. I wouldn\u2019t dare say such a thing.\u201dSuddenly, someone exclaimed, \u201cSu Yi?\u201dA man and woman walked over. The man was tall, heroic-looking, and handsome, but his eyes widened when he saw Su Yi, as if he dared not believe what he was seeing.Su Yi looked up. He recognized the man at a glance.Yan Chengrong, a\u00a0prominent figure of Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect.He was harsh-tempered and arrogant, and just like Wei Zhengyang, he was the scion of one of the prefectural capital\u2019s major clans.He and Su Yi had once been hostile to each other. When Su Yi was chosen as the outer sect\u2019s Sword Chief, Yan Chengrong was naturally unconvinced.He once said a line that was famed throughout Blueriver Sword Manor: \u201cSo what if I can\u2019t beat Su Yi? Does that mean I\u2019m not even allowed to look down on him?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t win, but he could still look upon Su Yi in disdain. He was like a hoodlum firing off wisecracks to satisfy himself. Even without a fight, they could fling insults to their heart\u2019s content.To Yan Chengrong, the son of a major clan, the Su Yi he once knew as the Outer Sect Sword Chief was indeed strong. Still,\u00a0Su Yi\u2019s status paled in comparison to his, which was what gave him the confidence to look down on Su Yi so brazenly.But of course, all of that was in the past.\u00a0After losing his cultivation and getting expelled from Blueriver Sword Manor, Su Yi was already nothing but an old joke.But Yan Chengrong wouldn\u2019t have guessed he\u2019d bump into Su Yi at the gates of the House of Prosperity of all places.\u201cOh? Junior Apprentice Brother Feng Xiaofeng is here too? Tch tch, you brothers in adversity are back together, huh?\u201d When Yan Chengrong saw Feng Xiaofeng, his words were mocking and his tone strange.\u201cSigh! What\u2019s the point of saying all that? You\u2019re nothing but a waste and a cripple. If I bully you now and word gets out, it\u2019ll just hurt my reputation.\u201d Yan Chengrong shook his head, as if this were no longer interesting. He wrapped his arm around his lady companion\u2019s slender waist, then proceeded into the House of Prosperity.\u201cRight,\u201d he said, almost as an afterthought, \u201cNian Yunqiao is here tonight too, and he brought Yu Qian. They\u2019re both in the seventh floor\u2019s \u2018Splendid Hall.\u2019\u201dFeng Xiaofeng didn\u2019t care about Yan Chengrong\u2019s taunts in the least, but when he heard that final sentence, his expression darkened and his fists clenched. His eyes flashed with pain, fury, and bitterness.Su Yi patted him on the shoulder and said flatly, \u201cWhy lose your temper at a group that\u2019s about to die? It\u2019s not worth it.\u201dFeng Xiaofeng whispered bitterly, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, let\u2019s just go back. If Nian Yunqiao finds out we\u2019re here, he\u2019s sure to show up and cause trouble.\u201d\u201cWhy go back? Actually, I think we picked just the right place to dine.\u201d Su Yi\u2019s tone was casual, but a chill flashed through the depths of his inscrutable gaze.Half a year ago, it was Nian Yunqiao who\u2019d broken Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s legs, transforming him into a cripple!And Yu Qian was originally the girl Feng Xiaofeng liked most, but she was also the one who stabbed him the most ruthlessly in the end.\u201cRight!\u201d said Huang Qianjun. \u201cAnd I insist on eating our meal at the House of Prosperity, and furthermore, I want us to enjoy ourselves thoroughly!\u201dThe servant couldn\u2019t help but repeat, \u201cI apologize, but there is currently no space for you to dine in the House of Prosperity. I suggest you try another restaurant.\u201dHe had just witnessed the way Yan Chengrong taunted Su Yi and Feng Xiaofeng. Looking at Su Yi\u2019s group now, his expression carried a newfound hint of impatience, and his tone was noticeably colder.Huang Qianjun was instantly furious; Yan Chengrong\u2019s brazen arrogance had enraged him too.\u00a0Now, even the servants dared look down on them. How could Huang Qianjun bear such humiliation?But just as he was about to speak, Su Yi casually tossed over a command token. \u201cTake a look at this. Is this qualification enough?\u201dThe servant caught the medallion. He was suddenly a bit uncertain.The command token was carved out of purple jade. It was heavy, and it glowed beneath the lamplight.On the back, the character \u201cXiao\u201d was engraved in an old-fashioned, exuberant style.\u201cPlease wait a moment. I need to check with the manager.\u201dThe servant couldn\u2019t determine the jade medallion\u2019s origins, but he sensed that it was no ordinary object, so he hurriedly entered the House of Prosperity.Before long, an entire group rushed out of the building. The sight left the servants stationed near the main gate utterly bewildered.What\u2019s going on?Why are the owner and all eight managers here?Is it to welcome some distinguished\u00a0guest?The scene drew some of the nearby guests\u2019 gazes too. All of them looked surprised.In the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital, the proprietor of the House of Prosperity, \u201cMadam Cuiyun\u201d, had eyes and ears all over the city, and her reach extended far and wide. She had deep connections with many of the city\u2019s long-established higher-ups.The managers were more than enough to welcome even most major powers. An \u2018ordinary VIP\u2019 was in no way qualified to receive Madam Cuiyun\u2019s personal welcome.Much less the joint efforts of Madam Cuiyun and all eight managers!Before long, all gazes turned toward them.\u201cYour Excellencies, it\u2026 It was this young lord who gave me this command token.\u201d The servant was covered in sweat, and he lowered his head and stood to the side, shaking, too afraid to even breathe heavily.The second he showed the token to a manager, the manager\u2019s expression underwent a dramatic shift, and he immediately went looking for Madam Cuiyun.That ultimately led to the current spectacle.The servant would never have guessed, not even if you cracked his head open, that a mere command token could wield such unbelievable power. Even a lofty, distinguished figure like the proprietor had been stunned into action. She\u2019d come here to welcome these guests in person!Whoosh!Madam Cuiyun\u2019s gaze landed on Su Yi, and she was briefly stunned. It seemed she hadn\u2019t anticipated that the medallion\u2019s owner would be so young.Then, she bowed and smiled, \u201cYoung Lord, thank you for gracing our humble shop with your presence. I apologize for not coming out to greet you earlier and humbly request your forgiveness.\u201dHer hair was tied up in a bun, and she wore a form-fitting, dark dress. Her face was dignified and beautiful, her skin snowy white and tender. Her every subtle movement carried a mature charm.The eight managers behind her each clasped their fists in turn.This scene left the nearby servants and guests dumbfounded.And the first servant, the one who\u2019d greeted them at the door, practically flung himself to his knees. He wanted to cry, but he had no tears.\u00a0He\u2019d thought\u00a0Su Yi\u2019s\u00a0party nothing\u00a0but a group of insignificant kids. Who would have thought\u2026. That they had such a grand background?Feng Xiaofeng, Feng Xiaoran, and A-Fei felt a bit dizzy.\u00a0It\u2019s just a command token. Why did it cause such a disturbance?\u201cWe\u2019d like to dine here. We\u2019ll have to trouble you to arrange a private room,\u201d said Su Yi.His calm composure made Madam Cuiyun nod to herself.To carry the most precious command token of the Lanling Xiao Family, the Purple Jade Token, meant that Su Yi was undoubtedly extraordinary, regardless of his age.But in contrast with the youth in blue, the others\u2019 attire was rather strange. A few of them were obviously just kids from the slums.But Madam Cuiyun was conscientious enough not to inquire any further, nor did her gaze or bearing let slip any sign that she found this unusual.She turned to one of the managers and ordered, \u201cGo and get the ninth floor\u2019s \u2018Mountain and River Palace\u2019 in order. Have someone brew tea, and remember: use the best we have, the kind reserved for entertaining our most distinguished guests.\u201d\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am!\u201d The manager ran off to carry out her orders.\u201cYou, fetch a jar of the\u00a0Azuresky\u00a0Burn from my private collection and have it delivered to the Mountain and River Palace. Consider it a token of the House of Prosperity\u2019s regard.\u201d\u201cYou, have the chefs prepare a feast. Have them choose the best ingredients we have on hand, and have Ol\u2019 Wang take charge of their preparation personally.\u201d\u201cAnd you: wait outside the Mountain and River Palace. Be prepared to receive further instructions at any moment. You are not to be the least bit negligent.\u201d Madam Cuiyun spoke at lightning speed. After this rapid-fire series of commands, the managers rushed off to do as they were told.When she was finished, she smiled radiantly, then bowed slightly and gestured for Su Yi\u2019s group to follow her. \u201cPlease, right this way.\u201dAs she said this, she already started leading the way.This level of courtesy and ostentatiousness left many of those nearby so stunned, their jaws practically fell off.It was only after Su Yi\u2019s group disappeared into the Hall of Prosperity that the servant who\u2019d initially turned away could no longer remain standing. He thudded to his knees, his face ashen.He had already sensed that this time, he might really be finished.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Arrogant Nonsense, Each Guest With Their Own ThoughtsThe ninth floor of the House of Prosperity.The Vast Desert Palace.Zhou Zhili stood near the window, watching this play out. He looked away, a strange expression on his face.\u201cSee? There\u2019s no need for you to intervene. Su Yi got in on his own,\u201d said Qing Jin languidly.When Su Yi\u2019s group first arrived at the House of Prosperity, Qing Jin just happened to spot them through the window.The sight then drew Zhou Zhili\u2019s attention too. He witnessed everything that happened by the House of Prosperity\u2019s entryway.\u201cThat servant is, after all, a low-level figure. He couldn\u2019t possibly tell how incredible Su Yi is. And here I thought I could seize this opportunity to invite Su Yi to join us. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed this would happen. Martial Aunt, you sure hit the nail on the head. Someone like him doesn\u2019t need us to back him up at all,\u201d lamented Zhou Zhili.The prefectural governor of the Harmony Prefecture, Mu Zhongting, was there too.He suddenly said, \u201cI have an impression of that blue-robed youth. That day you disembarked from the tower ship, he looked at me from a distance. It seemed he realized who I was.\u201dZhou Zhili was stunned.Qing Jin thought about it, then said, \u201cI doubt he knew who you were. It\u2019s more likely that he could discern your cultivation.\u201dIndeed, she was right on the mark.Mu Zhongting couldn\u2019t help but feel curious. \u201cWho is that young man? Why is that you attach such importance to him?\u201dQing Jin recalled everything that had happened between her and Su Yi during their time on the tower ship. An inexplicable thread of melancholy and despondency rose within her heart, and she said, \u201cYour Lordship, you\u2019d best ask His Sixth Highness.\u201dShe stood alone before the latticed window, arms crossed, staring out at the sea of lantern-lit buildings. Her eyes were bright and sharp, but it was clear her thoughts were elsewhere.\u201cYour Lordship Mu, let\u2019s sit and chat for a bit,\u201d said Zhou Zhili with a laugh. Unlike his martial aunt, he was in high spirits.The Mountain and River Palace.The floors were carpeted in red, and candles hung from the walls, fully illuminating the private dining room\u2019s interior.There was a massive vase, almost half as tall as a person, with a vibrant, blooming bouquet, and the walls were adorned with a thirty-foot-wide scroll painting of mountains and rivers, which provided an additional layer of elegance.The sandalwood table at the center of the room was massive; it could have easily accommodated twenty people. There were fresh, in-season melons and exquisitely prepared light refreshments laid out on its surface.And there were already five young servant girls waiting on one side of the room.When they entered the Mountain and River Palace, Feng Xiaoran and A-Fei were briefly dazed. A-Fei suddenly became a lot more reserved; he feared his shoes would dirty the red carpet.Feng Xiaofeng, meanwhile, was dumbstruck. He\u2019d grown up in poverty, and although he\u2019d once cultivated in Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s outer sect, he rarely entered luxurious or expensive places, much less the ninth floor of the House of Prosperity famed throughout the city. This was a place that only famed, influential people were qualified to enter.Huang Qianjun looked around and commented, \u201cNot bad, not bad at all. This is way better than Guangling City\u2019s Immortal Gathering House.\u201dThen he mocked himself, \u201cI\u2019ve been to the House of Prosperity, but I\u2019ve never had the chance to dine on the ninth floor.\u201dMadam Cuiyun smiled, the sight moving. \u201cOur House of Prosperity\u2019s hospitality was lacking. Young Lord, we welcome you to visit as often as you like going forward. Please, give us the chance to make up for our mistakes.\u201dHuang Quanjun couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He naturally didn\u2019t take her words seriously; he knew full well that the only reason he could enjoy such treatment now was that he was basking in Su Yi\u2019s light.Without Su Yi, Huang Qianjun feared that someone as well-connected and influential as Madam Cuiyun wouldn\u2019t even notice him.Su Yi was the calmest of all. It was as if he didn\u2019t even see the luxuriously intricate decor. He just pushed Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s wheelchair over to the banquet table, then called for Feng Xiaoran and A-Fei to join them.Only then did he turn his gaze towards Madam Cuiyun. \u201cThis place is rather decent. Please have them bring our meal as soon as possible.\u201dMadam Cuiyun\u2019s bright eyes surveyed the room, and she smiled radiantly. \u201cAs you wish, Young Lord. I shan't disturb you any longer, but if you have any further needs, please feel free to command the servants.\u201dWith that, she smiled, turned, and left.After the door closed, Feng Xiaofeng and the others each exhaled. They were much more relaxed without her here.They\u2019d grown up in poverty, so they couldn\u2019t adjust to a situation like this so suddenly. They couldn\u2019t possibly be as relaxed and at ease as Huang Qianjun.But Su Yi, meanwhile, didn\u2019t care about any of this at all.In his past life, he was the honored guest of Imperial Realm Emperors on numerous occasions. He had also hosted guests from all over the Wilds in his hidden realm, a place like an immortal paradise.By comparison, nothing in the world of the mundane amounted to much.Once Su Yi and Huang Qianjun were in their seats, the young servant girls poured tea and water. They were obedient and dextrous, and their service was meticulous.They didn\u2019t show the slightest negligence on account of Feng Xiaofeng and company\u2019s coarse clothing.Before long, one delicacy after another was laid out on the table, the dishes steaming hot and tantalizingly aromatic. Each contained rare, top-grade ingredients, prepared in a wide variety of styles. Just the sight was enough to make someone\u2019s fingers twitch with anticipation.Su Yi could also sense threads of spiritual energy drifting up from the dishes, and he realized that all of the ingredients were infused with spiritual medicines. That was what gave them their spiritual air.At first, Feng Xiaofeng and the others were reserved, but before long, they began eating with great relish.Feng Xiaoran sat next to Su Yi, and she didn\u2019t forget to fill his plate. When she saw that Su Yi\u2019s cup was empty, she refilled it before the servants got the chance.\u201cThis wine\u2019s quite good! It\u2019s strong, too. No wonder Madam Cuiyun kept it in her personal stash.\u201d Huang Qianjun was the least reserved. He drank and ate in big gulps.There was nothing for it; this was his first time enjoying such treatment too, and he naturally ate with great enthusiasm.\u201cBig Brother Huang, is this meal going to cost a whole lot of silver?\u201d A-Fei asked as he chewed on a piece of meat.\u201cSilver?\u201d Huang Qianjun shook his head. \u201cDo you remember what I said earlier? A problem you can resolve with money isn\u2019t really a problem. And a meal like this isn\u2019t something you can acquire with money alone.A-Fei\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThen how do you acquire it?\u201d\u201cHigh status and authority. Either does the trick,\u201d sighed Huang Qianjun.A-Fei only half understood.And Su Yi couldn\u2019t help but admit to himself that in the world of the mundane, status and authority really could resolve certain problems with greater ease.Xiao Tianque had said as much when he first gave him the medallion. When walking through the world of the mundane, it was hard to avoid trivial problems which weren\u2019t worth using force to resolve.Take tonight, for instance. Even if his cultivation were higher than it already was, what was he supposed to do? Use it against the mere servant who greeted them at the door?It was at times like this that the command token Xiao Tianque gave him was useful.\u2026The sixth floor of the House of Prosperity.The Splendid Hall.Yan Chengrong and his lady companion arrived, but with their status, they could only sit at the end of the table.That was because this banquet\u2019s host was a prominent figure of the Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s inner sect\u2014Chen Jinlong!His father, Chen Dakong, was a prominent figure within the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital. The River Gang under his banner had members numbering in the thousands, and they controlled half of the prefectural capital\u2019s water transportation industry.Chen Dakong and the Cloudriver prefectural governor, Qin Wenyuan, were close. Rumor had it that they\u2019d become sworn brothers in their youth.With Qin Wenyuan as his backer, Chen Dakong\u2019s River Gang naturally flourished, growing stronger with each passing day.Chen Jinlong was Chen Dakong\u2019s son. Even most scions of notable family clans could only look up to him, and they had to be polite.Several men and women accompanied Chen Jinlong. Their statuses were all exceptional too.Take Nian Yunqiao. He and Yan Chengrong were both outer sect disciples, but in terms of status, Yan Chengrong paled in comparison.Or Li Moyun. He was from the Li Family, the strongest clan in all of Guangling City, and he was the man of the hour in Blueriver Sword Manor\u2019s inner sect. In terms of cultivation, even Chen Jinlong was a bit inferior to him.The banquet was lively, although Chen Jinlong did most of the talking. As he spouted boastful nonsense, the others smiled and echoed his words.Even the girls. Their eyes frequently turned toward Chen Jinlong, their burning gazes carrying hints of awe.It took a while, but Yan Chengrong finally found and seized an opportunity to speak up. He cleared his throat and laughed. \u201cEveryone, can you guess who I bumped into just as I arrived?\u201d\u201cThe House of Prosperity welcomes distinguished guests and prominent figures every day. How could we possibly guess who you saw? Don\u2019t keep us guessing. Quick, tell us!\u201d said Nian Yunqiao.\u00a0His shirt was royal blue, and his cheeks were long and narrow, while his eyes were slightly dark and sunken. He looked a bit weak and sickly.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Hurry up and say it!\u201d Yu Qian urged from her seat beside Nian Yunqiao.\u00a0She had fair skin and beautiful features, and when she batted her big eyes, she looked sweet and adorable.When he sensed that he was now the center of attention, Yan Chengrong felt a rush of satisfaction. He didn\u2019t keep them in suspense. \u201cIt was Su Yi and Feng Xiaofeng, those brothers in adversity.\u201dThe banquet\u2019s lively atmosphere came to a sudden standstill. Everyone\u2019s expressions went strange, while Nian Yunqiao\u2019s eyes flashed with cold light.Yu Qian\u2019s pretty face went rigid, and she suddenly felt uncomfortable.Li Moyun\u2019s heart clenched as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning. His grip tightened around his cup.Su Yi!He\u2019s actually come to the prefectural capital?A few days ago, he received a secret letter from his father, Li Tianhan. In it, his father told him that Yuan Luoxi of the Yuan Family had honored Su Yi as a VIP guest and dined with him in the Immortal Gathering House.The letter explained what had happened in detail.The last portion of the letter used an extremely harsh tone to warn Li Moyun not to act against Su Yi, no matter what. Su Yi was no longer someone their Li Family could afford to offend!By the time he finished reading the letter, Li Moyun felt so stifled, he almost coughed up blood.About a week ago, on the second night of the second lunar month, he set up an ambush. He planned to kill Su Yi without anyone knowing about it.Who would have guessed that Su Yi would actually take first place in the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet, making a name for himself on both sides of the Great Azure overnight?As a result, Li Moyun had no choice but to give up on his plans, and under his father\u2019s orders, he was forced to leave Guangling City that very night!Yet now, just a few days later, Su Yi\u00a0had\u00a0ascended even higher, becoming Yuan Luoxi\u2019s distinguished guest!This news practically drove Li Moyun insane.Yuan Luoxi!The pearl of the Yuan Family, one of the prefectural capital\u2019s four peak-level factions! Her status was so lofty that even everyone in this room combined paled in comparison!Today was the eighth day of the second lunar month, but Su Yi was already here in the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital\u2026Li Moyun\u2019s chest felt tight and stuffy. He felt as if grey clouds had swallowed up the sun, casting his heart into endless darkness.What, is this guy fated to be my arch-enemy?\u00a0Li Moyun took a deep breath, then suppressed his sullen irritation.But then, their host, Chen Jinlong, couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. \u201cA cripple and a waste who lost his entire cultivation were foolish enough to attempt to dine at the House of Prosperity? I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t even make it through the door!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Those Mentally Unbalanced SectmatesChen Jinlong\u2019s disdainful jeers triggered a round of uproarious laughter.Only Li Moyun couldn\u2019t laugh.\u00a0How could someone Yuan Luoxi honored as a distinguished guest fail to even get through the House of Prosperity\u2019s doors?But then, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain.\u00a0When he received his father\u2019s letter, he understood something.The Blueriver Sword Manor inner sect elder, Zhou Huaiqiu,\u00a0as well as inner sect disciples Ni Hao and Nan Ying, had already left Guangling City. However, they'd yet to return to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital.Nor had news of Su Yi\u2019s recovery and victory at the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet made it back to the sect.Even now, no one in Blueriver Sword Manor knew that Su Yi was no longer the cultivation-less waste he\u2019d once been!If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t spread the news either. The disciple the sect heartlessly abandoned recovered just a year later? How would the sect\u2019s higher-ups feel if they knew?Once water spills, it\u2019s hard to gather back up!And Ni Hao and Nan Ying naturally wouldn\u2019t do anything to build Su Yi up at the cost of their own ambitions.It was then that Nian Yunqiao\u2019s long, narrow face sneered cruelly, and he snorted, \u201cIt seems Feng Xiaofeng still hasn\u2019t learned his lesson. He ought to be grateful that he didn\u2019t bump into me instead, or else I would\u2019ve taken his arms, too!\u201d\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Nian, he\u2019s nothing but a cripple. Why bother with him?\u201d said Yu Qian softly, a complicated expression on her face. \u201cLet\u2019s not discuss him any further; it\u2019ll only sour the mood.\u201dA youth suddenly spoke up. \u201cOne of my friends is from Guangling City, and a little while ago, he said that Su Yi seemed to have recovered his cultivation and that he took first place in Guangling City\u2019s biggest martial arts competition, the Dragon\u2019s Gate Banquet. Do you think that\u2019s true?\u201dEveryone froze. Then, all of them glanced at Li Moyun; all of them knew he was from Guangling City too.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Li Moyun\u2019s eyelids twitched, and he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t been in contact with my family lately, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s been happening in Guangling City recently.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t willing to discuss it. If he did, it would be like admitting how incredible Su Yi was.\u201cForget it. Never mind that waste. Let\u2019s continue our feast,\u201d said Chen Jinlong with a wave of his hand.But almost immediately afterward, a youth in silver robes pushed open the door and entered. He was carrying a jug of wine.Sun Qu.He was an outer sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor, and as soon as he entered the room, he said with an air of mysteriousness, \u201cWhen I went to grab some wine just now, I heard something interesting. Want to know what it was?\u201d\u201cOh? What is it?\u201d asked Chen Jinlong.\u201cJust now, Madam Cuiyun made a personal appearance,\u201d said Sun Qu. She led all eight managers of the House of Prosperity to the gates to greet a group of guests.Chen Jinlong explained, \u201cWho could possibly be so illustrious as to make Madam Cuiyun lead all her managers to greet him?\u201dThe others looked curious too.\u201cThey say it was a group of strange youths,\u201d said Sun Qu. \u201cTheir leader was a youth in blue robes. He looked seventeen, give or take. But it\u2019s his companions who were really strange.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d Chen Jinlong was starting to lose patience. \u201cQuit beating around the bush and get the point!\u201dSun Qu laughed. \u201cOne of them was a cripple in a wheelchair. One was a boy in straw sandals and dirt-smeared pants, while another was a little girl in coarse clothes. Doesn\u2019t that sound strange to you?\u201dThe group couldn\u2019t help but nod; such a line-up was indeed strange.This was the House of Prosperity! A place the poor couldn\u2019t even enter!Yet they hadn\u2019t just gotten in; Madam Cuiyun herself had rallied all eight managers to personally greet them at the door. That was far too out of the ordinary!Only Yan Chengrong\u2019s expression changed dramatically. He seemed to have realized something, but at the same time, he seemed not to quite believe it.\u201cBrother Yan, what\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Li Moyun suddenly picked up on Yan Chengrong\u2019s unusual state.\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m just going to step out for a moment.\u201d Yan Chengrong forced a smile, then rose and left the room.Before long, he found a servant and asked in hushed whispers about the group of guests Madam Cuiyun had just welcomed to the restaurant.When he finished, he returned to their private dining room in a daze, as if his soul had left his body.This was so out of character that even Chen Jinlong couldn\u2019t help but frown in displeasure. \u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Yan, what\u2019s going on with you? If you\u2019re not feeling well, go home. Don\u2019t sour everyone\u2019s mood!\u201dThe others noticed it too. Yan Chenrong\u2019s behavior was strange and out of place.Yan Chengrong shuddered, as if coming back to his senses. He swept his gaze across the room, then said bitterly, \u201cYoung Master Chen, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not feeling well. It\u2019s that earlier, I confirmed something, and it\u2026. Well, I just don\u2019t get it.\u201dBefore they could ask, he said, considering each word, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the guests Madam Cuiyun just went out to greet were almost certainly Su Yi, Feng Xiaofeng, and their companions!\u201dThe room instantly fell so silent that you could hear a pin drop.Astonishment was written all over their faces.Except for Li Moyun\u2019s. His heart shook, and he sucked in a breath of cold air.Su Yi really did manage to sink his filthy claws into Yuan Luoxi!But no; if all he did was win Yuan Luoxi\u2019s backing, that wouldn\u2019t be enough for Madam Cuiyun to lead such a grand procession to greet him. Is there some other mystery behind this?The more he thought, the more stifled and heavy Li Moyun\u2019s heart. He was so upset, he wanted to cough up blood.Chen Jinlong couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He frowned and asked, \u201cHow could the likes of Su Yi and Feng Xiaofeng be worthy of Madam Cuiyun coming down to greet them personally?\u201dHe\u2019d only just mocked Su Yi and his companions, saying that they wouldn\u2019t even make it through the House of Prosperity\u2019s front door.Who\u2019d have thought that, just a few minutes later, Yan Chengrong would say something so outrageous? It was a blatant slap in the face.Yan Chengrong hurriedly explained, \u201cIt was precisely because this doesn\u2019t make any sense that I was so out of sorts. Still, I\u2019m almost completely certain that it was in fact Su Yi and company.\u00a0\u201cFeng Xiaofeng\u2019s legs are crippled, so he\u2019s stuck in a wheelchair. I saw him clearly just now. There\u2019s no mistaking it!\u201dThe atmosphere instantly grew more stifled. Everyone was confused and uncertain.\u201cIf we go take a look, we\u2019ll know if it\u2019s true or not, now won\u2019t we? If it really is Su Yi and his cohort, well, we were once his sectmates. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t go greet him, is there?\u201d Nian Yunqiao\u2019s expression was unsightly, his eyes cold and sinister.\u201cWhere are they now?\u201d Chen Jinlong\u2019s eyes flashed.\u201cThe ninth floor, the Mountain and River Palace,\u201d said Yan Chengrong immediately.When he said this, the group in attendance only became more unsettled.Despite Chen Jinlong\u2019s status, he could at most arrange a banquet on the sixth floor!And that was special treatment he got by relying on his father\u2019s prestige.But Su Yi, someone all of them looked down on, had ascended to the ninth floor in a single bound. He could stand at the pinnacle of the House of Prosperity and gaze down upon the sea of lanterns. Furthermore, he could enjoy the highest-level feast and highest-level hospitality the restaurant had to offer!When they compared themselves to him, it was hard to remain mentally stable.\u201cCome on! We\u2019re going to the Mountain and Sea Palace!\u201d Chen Jinlong could no longer repress his displeasure. He got up and headed out the door.When the others saw this, they got up and followed him, one by one.Only Li Moyun remained behind.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Li, aren\u2019t you going to check it out?\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s a word of advice: this is the House of Prosperity. If Su Yi made it to the ninth floor, there\u2019s inevitably a good reason for it, so you\u2019d be better off staying here,\u201d said Li Moyun expressionlessly.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Li, we\u2019re just going to visit a former\u00a0sectmate, not to cause trouble. If you don\u2019t want to go, fine. We\u2019ll go without you.\u201d Chen Jinlong snorted, then led the others away.\u201cFoolish!\u201d Li Moyun laughed coldly.But then, even now, he still couldn\u2019t fully accept the reality that Su Yi had grown strong. A part of him still felt as if this were just a bad dream and that he\u2019d wake up any minute now.It\u2019s actually only reasonable they\u2019d act like this. Chen Jinlong and the others still don\u2019t know that Su Yi regained his cultivation, and there\u2019s no way they\u2019d ever guess that he\u2019s now the distinguished guest of the Yuan Family.In their eyes, Su Yi is still nothing but a pitiful, ridiculous waste\u2026..\u00a0Li Moyun sighed to himself.The ninth floor.As soon as Chen Jinlong and his group arrived, the manager standing outside the Mountain and River Palace stopped them. \u201cDear guests, might I ask what you\u2019re doing?\u201dThe manager was an overweight middle-aged man in brocade robes, and he had keen eyes.He swept his gaze across the group, and he immediately recognized Chen Jinlong and the other young masters. As such, his tone was extremely polite.\u201cWe\u2026.\u201d Chen Jinlong wasn\u2019t at all happy.\u00a0A manager is standing outside the door awaiting further orders? Not even my father can enjoy such treatment!He took a deep breath, then forced a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re here to visit our sectmates.\u201d\u201cSectmates?\u201d The man in brocade robes was stunned.Chen Jinlong repressed his dejected, stifled feeling and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We just learned that our sectmates, Su Yi and Feng Xiaofeng, are currently dining in the Mountain and River Palace, so we decided to stop in and say hello.\u201d\u201cPlease wait a moment,\u201d said the middle-aged manager. \u201cAllow me to ask our distinguished guests first. I can only allow you inside if they give their approval first.\u201dHe then turned, paused in the doorway, and tidied his clothes. He bowed slightly at the waist, and a natural, warm, respectful smile spread across his face as he gingerly opened the doors and stepped inside.He was one of eight managers of the House of Prosperity. This was a lofty position, and he rarely humbled himself, not even before most major figures. This was a man who knew when to give and when to take.Yet now, he was being so polite and so careful!Chen Jinlong and company noticed this, and tidal waves of shock coursed through their hearts. They were jealous, but they also found it hard to believe.Meanwhile, within the Mountain and Sea Palace.As Su Yi drank, he turned to Huang Qianjun and ordered, \u201cAfter we eat, go arrange for a courtyard-style residence. I have only one requirement: it has to be quiet.\u201dHuang Qianjun nodded repeatedly and pounded his chest. \u201cBrother Su, leave a trivial matter like that up to me. I promise I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s a hundred-thousand-tael note. Take it.\u201d Su Yi took the banknote from his black jade pendant and passed it over.\u201cOkay!\u201d Huang Qianjun knew better than to refuse, and he knew that this wasn\u2019t his money; he was just managing it on Su Yi\u2019s behalf\u2026.Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, when did you get so rich?\u201dFeng Xiaoran and A-Fei were dumbfounded too. A hundred thousand taels of silver?To them, that was an unimaginable number.\u201cMaterial wealth is no longer important to me,\u201d laughed Su Yi, but he didn\u2019t explain. \u201cBut if I run into problems I can solve with money, I have no lack of funds.\u201dHe suddenly recalled something Yuan Luoxi once said: \u201cYou threw money at the problem? I can do that too.\u201dIt was then that a middle-aged man in brocade robes walked into the room, his face nothing but smiles.First, he closed the door. Then, he turned and greeted Su Yi respectfully. \u201cMy sincerest apologies for disturbing you, but Young Master Chen Jinlong and his companions have come. They say they\u2019re your\u00a0sectmates, and they request an audience. If you\u2019re unwilling to see them, I\u2019ll turn them away immediately.\u201dChen Jinlong!Su Yi\u2019s eyebrows shot up.Feng Xiaofeng said in a low voice, \u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Su Yi, back at Blueriver Sword Manor, Nian Yunqiao and Yan Chengrong were tight with this guy. In short, they\u2019re a clique, and Chen Jinlong is their leader.\u201dSu Yi nodded, then suddenly, he laughed. \u201cI was actually planning to go pay them a visit. Who\u2019d have thought they\u2019d come knocking on my door of their own volition?\u201dHe then turned to the middle-aged man in brocade robes. \u201cGo ahead and let them in.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Standing With a Sword, Indifferent as a God\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The man in brocade robes turned to leave.Su Yi\u2019s gaze then swept across the servant girls. \u201cYou should leave too. I have some things to discuss with these\u00a0sectmates\u00a0of mine.\u201dThe manager waved, then led the serving girls away in a hurry.\u201cAll you need to do is watch from the sidelines,\u201d said Su Yi to his companions. \u201cLeave everything else to me.\u201dBefore long, Chen Jinlong and his companions surged into the room. The manager silently closed the door behind them.\u201cSu Yi! It really is you!\u201d When he saw Su Yi seated at the head of the table, Chen Jinlong\u2019s eyes widened. His last thread of hope that this was just some misunderstanding shattered, and his face went rigid.The others looked as if they\u2019d seen a ghost too.\u201cFeng Xiaofeng!\u201d Nian Yunqiao\u2019s expression darkened, and he looked confused and uncertain.Who would have guessed that Yan Chengrong was actually right?It was simply unbelievable!People they\u2019d disdained as mere cripples were now sitting proudly in a banquet hall\u00a0even they\u00a0were unqualified to enter!The gap between reality and expectation was huge. How could they accept all of this at once?Yu Qian\u2019s petite frame froze. Astonishment was written all over her sweet, adorable face. She subconsciously asked, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Feng, just which influential character brought you all here?\u201dA trace of bitterness and hatred rose on Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s brow as he said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m not your senior apprentice brother, and I haven\u2019t been for quite some time. Why should I answer you?\u201dYu Qian\u2019s expression froze. She sighed, but said nothing.Even so, her words served as a warning to her companions. They looked around the room, but to their confusion, they saw no trace of any such \u201cinfluential character\u201d!\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Su Yi, I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that you of all people could dine here.\u201d Chen Jinlong got his emotions under control, sighed with emotion, then laughed, \u201cIf I do the math, it\u2019s been about a year since we last saw each other. If Yan Chengrong hadn\u2019t said you were here, I never would have dared believe it.\u201dYan Chengrong coughed drily. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su Yi, aren\u2019t you going to invite us to sit down? This is no way to treat your guests.\u201dHuang Qianjun snickered. \u201cKid, do you need me to help you recall what you said at the entrance to the House of Prosperity?\u201dYan Chengrong\u2019s words choked in his throat.Chen Jinlong was inwardly losing his temper, but on the outside, he smiled and said, \u201cIt was surely just a misunderstanding. Let\u2019s not discuss that. We\u2019ve just come to see Su Yi and Feng Xiaofeng, but we don\u2019t plan to stay long.\u201dSu Yi just sat there, fidgeting with a suet-colored jade cup. He seemed casual and at ease. His expression was calm, and he didn\u2019t say so much as a single word.But his calmness seemed utterly arrogant, and it only made Chen Jinlong and his companions angrier.Whatever else you might say, they\u2019d come for a visit of their own volition, yet Su Yi was just sitting there, not reacting at all. This was a blatant affront to their dignity!This entire situation was just too strange and too far out of the ordinary. Otherwise, they would have lost their tempers by now.Chen Jinlong repressed back his rage and forced a smile. \u201cJunior Apprentice Su, it seems we\u2019re not welcome here, so we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201dHe was inwardly full of regret. If he\u2019d known it would be like this, he would have listened to Li Moyun and stayed behind. Coming here was reckless, no different from inviting his own humiliation.The others felt uncomfortable too. None of them wanted to linger here either.\u201cHmph. What are you so self-satisfied over?\u201d Yan Chengrong couldn\u2019t help but mutter. \u201cSo what if you get to sit here? You\u2019re still nothing but a waste, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ll never be able to cultivate again for the rest of your life!\u201dHe then turned and was about to leave with Chen Jinlong and the others when Su Yi finally spoke up.\u201cYou showed up uninvited, and now you just want to leave?\u201d he said flatly. \u201cJust what kind of place do you think this is?Chen Jinlong whipped around, his eyes practically crackling with electricity and his expression dark. \u201cSu Yi, what the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201dThe others were displeased to begin with, so when they saw that Chen Jinlong seemed to have lost his temper, they turned around too. All of them looked at Su Yi, their expressions decidedly unfriendly.\u201cSu Yi, Yan Chengrong is right, you know! You lost your entire cultivation. So what if you can dine on the ninth floor? You\u2019re still no warrior!\u201d mocked a pretty girl in a cold voice. \u201cAlso, we didn\u2019t come here looking for trouble. This is still the House of Prosperity! Not even major powers would dare cause trouble here!When they heard this, Chen Jinlong and his cronies felt a thrill of pleasure.The realization that there was no major power in attendance unwittingly made them much calmer.And the pretty girl\u2019s words served as a reminder. Indeed, the person before them was nothing but a waste. Their attitudes silently shifted.Although they still didn\u2019t dare cause trouble, they were now full of confidence, and they recovered a bit of their initial sense of superiority.How could a waste compare to a true martial artist?Nian Yunqiao laughed coldly, then brazenly looked Feng Xiaofeng up and down. \u201cThink about it! If our Junior Apprentice Feng had really turned his fate around by clinging to some powerful backer, would he still be dressed in such worn-out shabby rags?\u201cLook at him! That crappy old wheelchair is covered in mud. Is that the look of someone who\u2019s recently risen to prominence?\u201d When he said this, he could no longer hold back laughter.The others were initially stunned, and the look in their eyes turned strange.\u00a0He\u2019s right! If Su Yi and his posse really rose to prominence overnight, why is Feng Xiaofeng still dressed in rags? He looks no different from the beggars out on the streets!It\u2019s not just Feng Xiaofeng, either. The young man next to him is gaunt and sallow-faced. Plus, he looks panicked, reserved, and uncomfortable. He\u2019s obviously just some street kid from the lowest rungs of society!This discovery dispelled much of their doubt, and their gazes filled with playful mockery, pleasure, and excitement.\u201cTell me, guys. Were we just about to let those two wastes pull one over on us?\u201d asked someone, clearly enraged.Yan Chengrong said with obvious ill intent, \u201cNo, it\u2019s true that they\u2019re wastes, but it\u2019s also true that this is the ninth floor of the House of Prosperity. It\u2019s a real head-scratcher.\u201dChen Jinlong asked directly, \u201cSu Yi, how about you explain yourself?\u201dA cold smile hung on his lips, and his gaze was rife with disdain. He was in high spirits and ready to fight; he no longer felt any of his earlier confusion, stifled anger, or dread.Su Yi\u2019s expression remained calm. He drained his suet-colored glass, then rose to his feet and strolled toward Chen Jinlong.His gaze was deep and inscrutable. It was calm, without the slightest ripple of emotion.When they saw Su Yi walking towards them, Chen Jinlong was briefly stunned, as if he suspected Su Yi was about to do something.But when he saw those emotionless eyes, an inexplicable chill coursed through his heart, and goosebumps rose on his skin.In that moment, he sensed a life-threatening danger approaching, and, practically on instinct, he drew his sword and pointed it at Su Yi.\u00a0\u201cStay where you are!\u201dBut even before he finished shouting, Su Yi stretched out the index finger of his right hand and tapped on the blade.Crack!Chen Jinlong\u2019s longsword could cut through iron as if it were mud, yet it cracked instantly, shards scattering in all directions.The wrist with which Chen Jinlong held his sword cracked a moment later; Su Yi had broken it with a single finger, with just the vibrations transmitted through the metal!\u201cYou\u2026!\u2019 Chen Jinlong cried out in agony. He tried to dodge, only for Su Yi to press down on his shoulder.Bang!An irresistible force bore down on Chen Jinlong. His knees gave, and he knelt on the ground, colliding with the red carpet with a dull thud.His sword shattered!His wrist broke!He\u2019d been forced to his knees!All of this happened in the blink of an eye.The entire room went deathly silent.Nian Yunqiao, Yan Chengrong, and the others were scared senseless.Chen Jinlong was an inner sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor, and he was the strongest of their group, with a cultivation at the peak of the Refining Bone Stage. Just one more step and he\u2019d begin Qi Accumulation.Yet now, he seemed as fragile\u00a0as paper\u00a0mache. Su Yi had suppressed him effortlessly!Of course they were stunned! Who wouldn\u2019t be?Even Feng Xiaofeng couldn\u2019t help but gasp. He\u2019d only learned today that Su Yi had recovered his cultivation.But he never would have guessed that even Chen Jinlong, an elite of the inner sect, would seem so weak by comparison!Feng Xiaoran\u2019s big eyes sparkled like crystals as she stared fixedly at Su Yi\u2019s tall, detached silhouette. Her little face was full of nothing but admiration and infatuation.In stark contrast, Huang Qianjun just laughed coldly. He was a silkpants, so he understood other silkpants better than anyone.The way he saw it, this bunch\u2019s behavior was even worse than\u00a0his\u00a0had been back in the day.When he saw Chen Jinlong struggling, Su Yi merely glanced at him coolly. \u201cIf you dare get back up, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dIt was just a single sentence, gone in an instant, but it contained chilling murderous intent. Chen Jinlong tensed up, and a chill coursed through his heart.\u201cSu Yi, this is the House of Prosperity! You dare cause trouble here? Aren\u2019t you afraid to die!?\u201d Yan Chengrong shouted, and his expression changed dramatically.By now, which of them\u00a0hadn\u2019t\u00a0realized that Su Yi wasn\u2019t the waste they thought he was? His cultivation had long since recovered, and moreover, he\u2019d become incomparably terrifying!This realization was like a sucker punch. They felt as if they\u2019d taken a blow to the head, and it was hard to accept all of this at once.Whap!Before Yan Chengrong could even react, Su Yi slapped him viciously, right across the face. He spun a full three circles in place before collapsing to the floor, his left cheek collapsed in on itself, swollen, and red. Blood poured from his mouth and nose as he shrieked like a slaughtered pig.He was just about to say something when he felt the tip of a sword pressed to his throat. When he looked up, he saw Su Yi holding Mortal Edge, his gaze calm and indifferent. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t afraid to die, go ahead. Shout and see what happens.\u201dYan Chengrong shuddered, his jaw clamped shut.\u201cRun! Go call for help!\u201d bellowed Nian Yunqiao. He turned and fled.\u201cDid I say you could leave?\u201d As his indifferent voice rang out, Mortal Edge let out a clear sword hum, then stabbed.Splurt! Splurt!Nian Yunqiao felt a sharp, agonizing pain in his knees, and he thudded to the ground. His kneecaps had been cut clean off, taking a good deal of skin and flesh with them. Blood poured down his legs.\u201cAh\u2014\u2014!\u201d Yu Qian was right beside Nian Yunqiao, so terrified that the blood drained from her beautiful face. She shrieked, her petite frame rooted to the spot. She no longer dared move a muscle.When the others saw this, they dared not act randomly either. All of them were pale with fright.\u201cSu Yi, there\u2019s no grudge between us! Why must you treat us like this?\u201d said a beautiful girl in a quavering voice. She was the one who\u2019d mocked him earlier, saying that this was the House of Prosperity and that even if Su Yi had found himself a backer, there was no way he\u2019d dare cause trouble.But now, she was so scared, she was on the verge of mental collapse. Her eyes brimmed with panic.\u201cNo grudge?\u201d asked Su Yi, his tone flat. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a price to pay for aiding and abetting others\u2019 misdeeds?\u201dHe raised Mortal Edge, then used its unsharpened back like an iron whip, striking the girl in the face.Whack!Her cheekbone shattered, and teeth flew through the air. She shrieked in agony and landed not far away, her face covered in blood. She was in too much pain to crawl back up.When Huang Qianjun saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but gasp.\u00a0How ruthless! He doesn\u2019t even hold back against pretty girls!\u201cSu Yi, what exactly do you want?\u201d Chen Jinlong knelt on the ground and roared in fury, rage and resentment written all over his face.Yan Chengrong, Nian Yunqiao, and the others were, without exception, practically mad with anger too.The Mountain and Sea Palace was quite big, but the smell of blood had already started permeating the air. It was so dense, it was almost suffocating.Every last gaze was fixed on Su Yi.The youth\u2019s robes were blue tinged with green, like jade, and he stood there holding his sword.As indifferent as a god.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Solitary Drinking, Facing Enmity With TranquilitySu Yi glanced at Feng Xiaofeng. \u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Feng, do you have anything you want to say to Nian Yunqiao?\u201d\u201cI\u2026..\u201d Feng Xiaofeng was inwardly excited, and his hands tightly gripped his wheelchair\u2019s armrests.He stared intently at Nian Yunqiao. His old enemy now knelt on the ground, face wracked with agony. The sight filled Feng Xiaofeng with an indescribable joy.Both of Feng Xiaofeng\u2019s legs were crippled. That was little different from crippling his cultivation. Feng Xiaofeng had lived in constant suffering ever since his injury, and his heart was in darkness.It was so bad that, if not for the fact that he still had a little sister to take care of, he likely would have ended his life long ago.But now, he saw his most hated enemy kneeling before him. How could he not be excited? How could he not feel joy?But in the end\u2014He said bitterly, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su Yi, this is the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital. If you kill him, you\u2019ll only bring enormous trouble upon yourself. I don\u2019t want you to doom yourself on my account.\u201dHis words moved Huang Qianjun, but Nian Yunqiao only laughed hysterically. \u201cHaha, Feng Xiaofeng, you\u2019re actually pretty clever, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll just let this go!\u201dHe looked up, then glared hatefully at Su Yi. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the balls, just kill me, right here in the House of Prosperity! Go on! Do it!\u00a0Do i\u2014!\u201dThis was blatant provocation. He was hatefully lashing out.Splurt!The sharp tip of a sword penetrated his throat, splattering blood against the snowy white walls. The bright red was stark and eye-catching.Nian Yunqiao\u2019s eyes were wide, as if he still didn\u2019t quite believe that Su Yi would actually do it\u2026Then, his head lolled to the side, and his entire body crashed to the floor.\u201cYou\u2026 you really dared kill him\u2026.\u201d Chen Jinlong could barely even speak.The others jumped in fright, and chills ran down their spines.Nian Yunqiao was the son of the Nian Family's leader, yet he\u2019d died, just like that?Remember, this was the House of Prosperity!\u00a0Yet Su Yi dared swing his sword around and kill people!\u201cYou saw it too: he asked for death himself,\u201d said Su Yi flatly.\u201c.....\u201d The crowd was at a loss.Feng Xiaofeng was both worried and moved. The rims of his eyes reddened; there was no way he\u2019d miss that Su Yi was throwing all caution to the wind just to avenge him.\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Feng, how do you plan to deal with her?\u201d Su Yi glanced at Yu Qian.When she sensed Su Yi\u2019s gaze, Yu Qian reacted as if she\u2019d been struck by lightning. The blood drained from her pretty face, and she thudded to the ground, her voice quavering with terror. \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su Yi, I was forced into this! Nian Yunqiao said that if I didn\u2019t submit, he\u2019d kill me! I\u2026 I had no other choice!\u201dSu Yi\u2019s gaze was calm and indifferent, without the slightest ripple of emotion.How could he possibly remain ignorant to the fact that she\u2019d betrayed Feng Xiaofeng without the slightest hesitation, all for the sake of clinging to Nian Yunqiao and boosting her own position?But now, she made it sound like she\u2019d been forced into it. What a joke!But Feng Xiaofeng looked uncertain. Some time passed before he finally gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su Yi, she and I had no relationship to begin with, and I disdain pursuing this matter with an opportunistic bootlicker like her!\"\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s right! I\u2019m just a debased bootlicker, so please, let me go!\u201d Yu Qian sobbed as she begged for her life.\u201cOff to the side with you, then,\u201d Su Yi raised his foot and kicked her.Bam!Yu Qian went flying through the air. It hurt so badly that she gasped, but her expression was celebratory. She knew she\u2019d just barely escaped disaster.When he sensed Su Yi\u2019s gaze turn toward him, the kneeling Yan Chengrong went rigid. He then slapped himself repeatedly across the face, howling, \u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su, I was wrong! I was wrong!\u201dNian Yunqiu\u2019s status was a whole level loftier than his, yet Su Yi had killed him with a single flick of the sword. Of course Yan Chengrong was terrified! How could he not be?\u201cDo you know what I returned to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital to do?\u201d asked Su Yi.Yan Chengrong shook his head in bewilderment.Splurt!With another flash of sword light, Yan Chengrong\u2019s throat\u00a0split\u00a0open, and his body toppled to the floor.Only afterward did Su Yi whisper, \u201cI\u2019m here for revenge.\u201dChen Jinlong and the others instantly felt as if they\u2019d been plunged into an icy abyss. Even their souls shook with terror.I\u2019m here for revenge!It was just one sentence, just a few words, but it brought back memories of their time in Blueriver Sword Manor and all their past enmities with Su Yi.\u201cBut\u2026. But you and I have no grudge!\u201d Chen Jinlong cried out with no regard for his dignity. All he wanted was to live on.\u201cThat\u2019s right, so you ought to be celebrating the fact that you\u2019re just kneeling on the floor, and that you\u2019re not just another corpse.\u201d Su Yi glanced at him.Chen Jinlong suddenly sensed that he\u2019d make it out of this alive, and his entire body relaxed.But shortly after, an indescribable sense of humiliation coursed through him. His sword had shattered, and he\u2019d been forced to his knees. He couldn\u2019t possibly just let this go!\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother Su, during our time together in the sect, I never bullied you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! We might have looked down on you, but we never really hurt you!\u201d\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother Su\u2026.\u201d All of them begged for their lives in quavering voices, one after another.No one wanted to die. Everyone was terrified that Su Yi\u2019s rage would extend to them too.Suddenly, Su Yi asked, seemingly out of nowhere, \u201cAre you perhaps wondering why the House of Prosperity\u2019s staff haven\u2019t come for you yet?\u201dChen Jinlong and his cronies\u2019 expressions changed. None of them dared respond.Su Yi sheathed his sword, returned to his seat, and leisurely poured himself a full glass of wine. \u201cI\u2019m curious too. Just how will the House of Prosperity respond to this? How about we wait and find out together?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Everyone hesitated.If possible, they\u2019d much prefer to leave this blood-soaked ground as soon as possible.Yet none of them dared do so.\u201cYou were right just now, you know. We were once in the same sect, and today\u2019s matter has little to do with you. But now, you\u2019re already mixed up in this. If I don\u2019t make you give up on getting even now, it\u2019ll be hard to prevent you from self-defeating foolishness down the line.\u201dSu Yi leaned back his head and drained his glass, his tone casual. \u201cI don\u2019t fear your revenge, but I detest trouble. I might as well just seize this opportunity and make sure this all ends here.\u201dThis floating world was complex and intertwined. Chains of hatred were hard to break.If he wanted to wipe out all enmity with a single swing of his sword, he had to eliminate all potential dangers.\u201cYou want to end this?\u201d someone said in a shaking voice. \u201cSu Yi, after what you\u2019ve done today, never mind us; do you really think the Nian and Yan Families will let you go? Much less the House of Prosperity itself? There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll just sit back and watch.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a threat. It seemed more like a warning.Su Yi thought nothing of it. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.\u201dHe poured himself yet another cup, looking calm and at ease, as if the blood-covered floors weren\u2019t even there.He wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned about the House of Prosperity\u2019s potential threat.His demeanor filled Chen Jinlong and the others with an indescribable wave of emotion.Dread? Rage? Enmity? Bewilderment? Confusion?All of them seemed to apply.\u2026\u2026The first floor of the House of Prosperity, in the hall reserved for the proprietor, Madam Cuiyun.\u201cThe Purple Jade Token?\u201d said a whiskered, distinguished-looking elderly gentleman in navy-blue robes. He furrowed his brow. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, throughout the Lanling Xiao Family, only two types of people are qualified to carry such a precious token.\u201cThe first are the core disciples of the main branch, but even they must first possess peerless talent and win the approval of at least half the family\u2019s higher-ups. Only then can they earn the right to carry this token and enjoy the authority it entails.\u201cThe second group qualified to bear such a token are Martial Dao Grandmasters!\u201cAnd throughout the Lanling Xiao Family, the direct line of descent only has two Martial Dao Grandmasters. One is the elderly Xiao Tianque. His cultivation is the highest; he\u2019s in the third level of the Inner Furnace Realm. The other is the current head of the Xiao Family, Xiao Boyun.\u201cEach of the Xiao Family\u2019s two branches have a Martial Dao Grandmaster to hold down the fort too, but in terms of cultivation, they\u2019re both a level below Old Man Xiao.\u201dThe long-robed elder\u2019s gaze was suddenly serious. \u201cFrom this, we can deduce that the youth in blue is most likely one of the most dazzling younger-generation talents of the Xiao Family\u2019s main line of descent!\u201d\u201cI suspected as much, which was why I dared not show the slightest negligence.\u201d Madam Cuiyun currently draped her graceful, mature figure over a soft couch. The smoke of an incense burner billowed into the air.Her beautiful eyes looked thoughtful. \u201cBut the part I can\u2019t quite figure out is that the Lanling Xiao Family\u2019s power is distributed throughout the White Province, the province nearest the Jade Capital. Why would one of their disciples appear here, thousands of miles away, in the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital?\u201dThe long-robed elder smiled faintly, then said humbly, \u201cMadam, if you wish to know, you can bring me to see him. I\u2019ve met quite a few influential characters of the Xiao Family in recent years, and so long as we exchange a few words, I should be able to determine his background.\u201dBut Madam Cuiyun shook his head. \u201cNo need. I only recognize command tokens, not their owners. It doesn\u2019t matter who carries the Purple Jade Token. I\u2019ll treat him as a distinguished guest regardless.\u201dThe long-robed elder nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the most appropriate move you could make, as well as the smartest.\u201dA hint of a smile tugged at Madam Cuiyun\u2019s lips. \u201cElder Li, you flatter me.\u201dIt was then that they heard the sound of urgent knocking at the door. \u201cYour Excellencies, something has happened in the Mountain and River Palace!\u201dMadam Cuiyun shot to her feet. \u201cCome in. Let\u2019s talk inside.\u201dAn overweight, middle-aged man in brocade robes rushed in. He was none other than the manager she\u2019d left outside the Mountain and River Palace\u2019s door.\u201cMadam, just now\u2026\u201d The manager dared not delay. He spoke as fast as he could, recounting everything he\u2019d heard of the disturbance in the private dining room from beginning to end.\u201cMurder?\u201d Madam Cuiyun\u2019s pupils constricted, her clear features suddenly sinister.\u201cHe knows full well that this is the House of Prosperity, yet he dares engage in wanton violence? Even if the boy is a core disciple of the Xiao Family\u2019s main line, how can he be so brazenly arrogant?\u201d The elder\u2019s expression darkened too.\u201cEven if he\u2019s brazen and arrogant, what can we do about it?\u201d Madam Cuiyun sighed. But then, her eyes shone with determination. \u201cLet\u2019s go and see what\u2019s happening. We can decide what to do then.\u201d\u201cThat works too. I\u2019d quite like to see this youth of dubious origins for myself.\u201d The elder\u2019s eyes glinted with cold light.\u201cElder Li, promise me that you won\u2019t act out of turn. If you do, don\u2019t blame me for turning away and denying our relationship,\u201d said Madam Cuiyun coldly.When he heard her warning, Elder Li\u2019s eyes narrowed, but he said nothing.They left in a hurry, and before long, their group reached the ninth floor\u2019s Mountain and River Palace.Madam Cuiyun took a deep breath. As soon as she pushed open the door, the smell of blood assailed their nostrils.A moment later, her eyelids\u00a0twitched\u00a0violently.There were two corpses sprawled out on the floor. One belonged to Nian Yunqiao, the other to Yan Chengrong. Both had taken a sword right through the throat, and their blood had already cooled.Someone knelt not far away. Shockingly, it was none other than Chen Jinlong, the son of the famed leader of the River Gang, Chen Dakong!This scene alone was enough to make Madam Cuiyun\u2019s heart sink.But then, she had seen plenty of wind and waves in her day. Her expression barely wavered as she fixed her gaze on Su Yi at the head of the table.The youth in blue seemed perfectly composed. He was drinking by himself, perfectly content, as if there were no one else here.Madam Cuiyun interacted with prominent figures year-round, and she could tell at a glance that the youth\u2019s unruffled calm wasn\u2019t something just anyone could fake.Was this really \u201cbrazen arrogance\u201d?No, this was obviously absolute confidence!Seth's ThoughtsThree digits! Yay!I think I\u2019m finally getting into the swing of things, but it\u2019s been quite the ride so far. Still, we\u2019re only just getting started! Thanks to everyone who\u2019s stuck with me and Su Yi thus far! Lots more to come!___On a slightly different note, the term \u201cfloating world\u201d is now most commonly associated with Japanese (Specifically, \u201cUkiyo\u201d art). But it was originally a Buddhist term that refers to the world we live in, and how fleeting and transient it all is. You could think of it as a synonym for the \u201cmundane world\u201d Su Yi brings up semi-regularly, just more Buddhist in tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
