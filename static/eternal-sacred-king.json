He was Cao Gang, one of the Five Wolf Guards of Cang Lang City.The other individual was a young man with clear, bright eyes and delicate features. He wore a green robe and exuded a strong scholarly aura.The young man\u2019s name was Su Zimo, the second young master of the Su Family in Ping Yang Town. He was a famous household name, having passed the provincial examination at the young age of 17.\u201cSecond Young Master Su is different from the other scholars that I know of. You may look frail but you have excellent riding skills. They are as good as that of my guards.\u201d Cao Gang said.\u201cLord Cao is too generous with your praise.\u201d Su Zimo gave a faint smile. \u201cMy elder brother has been in the business of selling horses for a long time. Horses have been my companion since I was a child. I have some foundation. Moreover, Zhui Feng is quite spiritual.\u201dHaving said that, Su Zimo patted the fine horse that he was riding.That horse by the name of Zhui Feng seemed to have understood Su Zimo\u2019s praise. It looked up and responded with a snort, revealing an intelligent gleam in its eye.At this moment, loud noises could be heard nearby. Someone was shouting, \u201cBig news! I heard that that girl of the Shen family has been chosen by the immortals. She is going to be accepted into the immortal sect.\u201d\u201cThe girl in the Shen family? Which Shen family?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Shen Mengqi. The one who is in marriage talks with Second Young Master Su.\u201dThe news had spread rapidly. The people in the surrounding area were already beginning to discuss this. Many people were casting peculiar looks at Su Zimo.\u201cImmortal?\u201d Su Zimo murmured quietly. His knowledge of immortals still remained at those in the illusory legends.Would humans possess the power to summon wind and rain, burn the sky and boil the sea?If he did not see it with his own eyes, Su Zimo did not believe that immortals existed in this word.At the sound of the word \u2018immortal\u2019, Cao Gang\u2019s body quivered. He wore a strange expression; worry and fear flashed across his eyes. However, Su Zimo did not notice this as he was frowning and deep in his own thoughts.At this very moment, a beam of light suddenly flashed across the sky with lighting speed. Just as it flew across Su Zimo\u2019s head, it reversed and stopped in mid-air.Everyone looked up instinctively. They could see three people standing in the air without any form of support. Seemingly, invisible powers were holding on to them.Su Zimo\u2019s expression changed slightly.Immortal!Ordinary mortals would neither understand nor come into contact with such skills.\u201cThe immortal has made its presence\u2026\u201d\u201cImmortal, please bestow us your blessings!\u201dThe impenetrable and dense crowd knelt and kowtowed at the same time. They were muttering prayers; their faces full of fear and reverence.Cao Gang was extremely quick in his movement. He alighted from the horse and knelt on the ground, shouting loudly, \u201cCang Lang City\u2019s commoner, Cao Gang, pays respect to the immortal!\u201dSu Zimo was shocked by Gao Gang\u2019s action.As one of the Five Wolf Guards, Cao Gang had extreme power and authority within hundreds of miles of radius from Cang Lang City. Yet, upon seeing the immortal, he knelt to him without any hesitation.In the blink of an eye, Su Zimo was sticking out like a sore thumb on his horse. He looked extremely eye-catching in the black sea of people who were all kneeling.There was pressure everywhere!Su Zimo was silent for a moment. He leaped down from Zhui Feng and looked up.In mid-air, the man in the middle of the trio was dressed in a long turquoise robe. He looked cold and aloof. His pair of long and narrow eyes gazed at the people below his feet, emitting an overbearing aura of arrogance from between his brows.Beside the turquoise-robed man stood a man and a woman, both from Ping Yang Town. The man\u2019s name was Zhou Dingyun. He was the most infamous rogue in the town who bullied men, ravished women and carried out all sorts of evildoings. Two years ago, Su Zimo sent him to prison. Now, that turquoise-robed man had taken him out of prison.Su Zimo frowned slightly. Given Zhou Dingyun\u2019s temperament and conduct, he could have a chance to enter the immortal sect as well? If Zhou Dingyun were to become an immortal, how many people would suffer as a result?Su Zimo\u2019s gaze turned to the young girl standing mid-air.The young girl\u2019s name was Shen Mengqi. At a prime age of 16, her complexion was fairer than snow and she exuded a natural and gentle charisma.Su Zimo had deciphered Shen Mengqi\u2019s intent through her eyes.Their once promise had become so vulnerable in the face of the legendary immortal fate. Su Zimo did not expect to see such a scene when the two met again.One was high and mighty in heaven and the other was standing on mortal ground.Shen Mengqi was also gazing at Su Zimo, a man that she had once admired so greatly.Once, Su Zimo was invincible in her heart. Enlightened at three years old; proficient with the Four Books and Five Classics at seven years old; passed the college examination at 12 years old and completed the provincial examination at 17 years old. Such a talent was unprecedented in the Country of Da Qi. He would definitely become a giant among men in the future.Under the intervention of Elder Young Master Su, Su Zimo had never learned martial arts. Even so, Shen Mengqi believed that Su Zimo would also be able to rise in the official rankings if he were to pick up martial arts.However, Shen Mengqi discovered that she had been wrong.Su Zimo\u2019s achievements ultimately belonged to the mortal world. It was not worth a mention in the eyes of the immortals.It was just an opportunity and she was already qualified to look down on Su Zimo.\u201cMortal, why aren\u2019t you kneeling?!\u201dAll of a sudden, the sound of this interrogation exploded by Su Zimo\u2019s ears like thunder striking across the ground. Dizzy and numb, he almost fell to the ground.He did not mind kneeling to the legendary immortal. However, the attitude of the turquoise-robed man was too much like that of a bully. It triggered feelings of injustice in Su Zimo\u2019s heart!These feelings of injustice arose from the resoluteness in Shen Mengqi\u2019s eyes, the doubts on the immortal\u2019s criteria on choosing disciples and his own pride.Su Zimo took a deep breath and suppressed the annoyance in his heart. He said loudly, \u201cI have received scholarly honors all my life. I can even choose not to kneel to the Ruler of Da Qi, why do I have to kneel to you!\u201dThe more you wanted me to kneel, the more I refused to!The so-called scholarly honors were of course Su Zimo\u2019s excuses.Shrouded by the domineering aura of the turquoise-robed man, the commoners in the surrounding were keeping mum out of fear. They dared not even lift up their head. On the other hand, Su Zimo\u2019s aura did not seem any weaker although he was confronting the immortal as an ordinary man.\u201cTrue enough, you are a foolish mortal.\u201dThe corners of the turquoise-robed man\u2019s mouth curled up slightly. His gaze was cold and aloof as he said calmly, \u201cSince that is the case, from today onwards, your scholarly honors\u2026 will be written off.\u201dHis tone was monotonous but there was no doubt about it.The turquoise-robed man continued to say, \u201cWhichever state that dares to accept this individual as an official will be declaring themselves as an enemy of Iridescent Clouds Palace and me, Perfected Cang Lang!\u201dAt the sound of the few words \u2018Iridescent Clouds Palace and Perfected Cang Lang\u2019, Cao Gang, who had been kneeling, was dumbstruck. He quickly said in a quivering voice, \u201cPerfected, be rest assured. In the Country of Da Qi, Su Zimo will be an inferior commoner for life!\u201dAn inferior commoner for life!With just a few words, Su Zimo\u2019s destiny had been decided.There was a flash of reluctance in Shen Mengqi\u2019s eyes. On the other hand, that rascal Zhou Dingyun was looking thrilled.Su Zimo looked very calm, as if this did not impact him.After a while, Su Zimo laughed and mocked himself, \u201cIf scholarly honors are so cheap, what do I need them for?\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dPerfected Cang Lang\u2019s long and narrow eyes gradually formed a line, beams of icy cold lights flashing in them.Su Zimo\u2019s provocation had aroused his murderous intent!At this moment, Zhui Feng, who was standing beside Su Zimo, suddenly became agitated and uneasy. His hooves rubbed against the ground and he neighed continuously.Su Zimo was expressionless but his heart jumped.Zhui Feng had also behaved in this way during the few occasions that he had encountered danger in the past.\u201cIt is actually a spiritual beast. Hurmp, how dare he cause a ruckus in front of me!\u201dPerfected Cang Lang gave a faint yell. He stretched out his index finger and pointed it at Zhui Feng lightly.There was no time to react. A flash of red light had already entered Zhui Feng\u2019s body.Under the gaze of everyone, a gush of scorching flames surged out from within Zhui Feng\u2019s body and engulfed Zhui Feng in a matter of moments.Swoosh!This flame was strong and was actually going to engulf Su Zimo too!Su Zimo was not as weak as the typical scholar. However, he had never seen such eccentric methods. He was completely stunned and stood rooted to the ground.With Su Zimo almost engulfed by the flames, Zhui Feng neighed sorrowfully and galloped away madly.Petrified, the crowd fled in all directions. Just after a few steps, Zhui Feng fell to the ground listlessly. In the blink of an eye, it had been burnt into a cloud of ash. Neither the corpse nor bones was left!The entire process occurred within the moments of a few breaths. Such flame definitely did not belong to the mortal world!One could just imagine. If Zhui Feng had not galloped away in time and Su Zimo were to catch onto any of the flame, his life would definitely not be spared.\u201cThis is a psychic fine horse that protects it\u2019s master. What a pity.\u201d Cao Gang, the Wolf Guard, exclaimed his regrets quietly.There was a gentle breeze. Zhui Feng\u2019s ash was floating in the air and did not dissipate for a long time. It seemed to be saying goodbye to it\u2019s master.Su Zimo looked at the other party dazedly; tears welling up in his eyes. His lost and distracted demeanor made one\u2019s heart ache for him.Perfected Cang Lang did not manage to kill Su Zimo on this occasion. There was a flicker of coldness in his eyes. He was having murderous intent again!\u201cMaster, forget it. He is just a mortal. Why do you need to lower yourself to his level?\u201dShen Mengqi said in a low voice as she looked at the Su Zimo beneath her. She eventually could not bear to harm him.Perfected Cang Lang hesitated a little.If he had to take actions continuously to deal with someone, it would certainly lower his status.Zhou Dingyun did not wish to let Su Zimo off so easily. He quickly said, \u201cMaster, you have to nip this problem in the bud to eliminate it completely, in case this person becomes your greatest problem in the future!\u201dPerfected Cang Lang was initially undecided. Upon hearing Zhou Dingyun\u2019s words, feelings of arrogance rose in his heart. He smirked and said, \u201cHe is just an inferior commoner without any spirit root. He won\u2019t be able to cultivate for life. In terms of potential, he can\u2019t even be compared to that beast earlier!\u201d\u201cSo what if I spare his inferior life?! Is he fit to become the greatest problem in my life? Maybe in the next life!\u201dZhou Dingyun secretly cursed. He did not expect his words to be counterproductive.Su Zimo was silent. He quietly picked up a handful of Zhui Feng\u2019s ash, turned and left.A hint of sarcasm flashed across Perfected Cang Lang\u2019s eyes. He said lightly, \u201cAlthough the inferior ant yearns for the sky, how can they ever touch the eagle\u2019s wings?\u201dAt the sight of Su Zimo leaving unscathed, Zhou Dingyun looked indignant.If not for this person, he would not have suffered so badly in prison. At the thought of this, Zhou Dingyun\u2019 eyes turned resentful and vicious. His expression was as capricious as the weather. One was uncertain what he was scheming about.Looking at Su Zimo\u2019s lonely and sad silhouette, Shen Mengqi quietly sighed in her heart.In less than half an hour, this man had lost everything. Perhaps he was only left with that pitiful pride.However, what was the use of that?\u201cSigh, Second Young Master Su had lost his honors and became an inferior commoner. He is no different from a good-for-nothing now.\u201d\u201cThe two young masters of the Su family. One is good in martial arts and the other a scholar. In recent years, they have the potential to rise in power and ranks. Unexpectedly, they have been dealt with such a blow. Fortunately, Elder Young Master Su is a Connate Expert.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of being a Connate Expert? That Lord Cao of Cang Lang is also a Connate Expert. Didn\u2019t he also kneel in fear upon seeing the immortal?\u201d\u201cBased on the immortal\u2019s words, Second Young Master Su is not even fit to cultivate. I\u2019m afraid he will eventually die of depression.\u201dSu Zimo lowered his head. He walked on quietly, seemingly oblivious to the discussions of the passers-by.\u201cZimo, wait a minute.\u201dThis voice was so familiar. Yet, the address was somewhat strange. Before today, the girl behind him had always addressed him intimately as Brother Zimo.Su Zimo continued to walk, without halting a step.Shen Mengqi caught up with him. There were delicate beads of sweat on the tip of her nose and she was frowning slightly. Panting, she said, \u201cZimo, have you become a fool by studying too much? What does it matter if you kneel down for a while?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. But I am not willing to.\u201d Su Zimo said calmly.Shen Mengqi was already angry at Su Zimo for not stopping for her. Upon hearing this, she was furious. She quickened her steps and blocked Su Zimo\u2019s path.\u201cSu Zimo, sober up!\u201dShen Mengqi stared at Su Zimo\u2019s eyes and said loudly, \u201cDon\u2019t think about revenge. It is impossible. You are already 17 years old and have missed the best age to learn martial arts. Moreover, you don\u2019t have the spirit root and can\u2019t cultivate at all. Even if you were to attain the Postnatal or Connate levels, they are mortal abilities. It is still vulnerable before the immortal!\u201dSu Zimo was silent. He looked at Shen Mengqi quietly.Shen Mengqi could not withstand Su Zimo\u2019s gaze. She lowered her head and said softly, \u201cYes, we did have a promise. I am also grateful to you for helping the Shen family all these years. But.. they are already a thing of the past. Moreover, we are people from two different worlds henceforth.\u201dSu Zimo laughed. He raised his eyebrow. \u201cIs your world so great?\u201dShen Mengqi said, \u201cZhou Dingyun and I will be leaving Ping Yang Town with the Perfected tomorrow. I came to bid you farewell. I don\u2019t wish to argue with you on these meaningless things.\u201d\u201cGo ahead. I am not able to send you off. We will meet again if we have fate.\u201dSu Zimo was downhearted. He walked past Shen Mengqi and moved on.Just as the two rubbed shoulders with each other, he heard Shen Mengqi mutter softly, \u201cOur fate has come to an end. We are separated as mortals and immortals. I\u2019m afraid\u2026 we will not see each other again.\u201dSu Zimo paused slightly in his steps. In the end, he walked away without saying another word.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It had totally changed how he looked at this world. It turned out there were indeed immortals in this world. With their powers, any immortal could be above the country, notwithstanding their backers, Iridescent Clouds Palace.To Su Zimo, it was nothing to lose his scholarly honors. But Zhui Feng was his companion since a young age. It was more than a horse to him, it was his closest kin.Not long after, Su Zimo reached his mansion.This mansion was small and deserted. There were only a few rooms. His older brother Su Hong rewarded him with this mansion when he passed the college examination at 12 years old.Su Zimo carried Zhui Feng\u2019s ashes and buried them beside the peach blossom tree in the center of the courtyard.\u201cZhui Feng, I planted the peach blossom tree by myself. It will keep you company in the future. There will be a day where I will pour the blood of Perfected Cang Lang on your ashes!\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s eyes turned red. He stood by the peach blossom tree quietly for a long while before he turned to leave.Su Zimo caught sight of someone as he turned to leave.It was a woman in a blood-red robe. She was beautiful. She was not flirtatious nor garish. She did not put on any makeup. She seemed like someone who had just come out from a painting.Su Zimo sighed. Like the ancient saying, she was a natural beauty, seemingly like a hibiscus that rose out of clear water.Despite being an exquisite beauty free from worldly cares, she was dressed in a scarlet, blood red long robe. It did not seem to match, but the contrast created a unique aura about her.Two years ago, Su Zimo returned home to find an unconscious lady near Cang Lang mountains. He was worried that she might be eaten by the beasts and hence he brought her back with him.The red-robed lady regained consciousness not long after she reached the mansion. She seemed to be well. However, she refused to say a word no matter how Su Zimo asked about her name or place of residence.The red-robed lady had lived here for two years, and Su Zimo never tried to drive her away.There was no servants in the mansion. Su Zimo was not used to being waited on. He took care of his three meals a day by himself.To him, it was nothing to have one more person in the mansion. All he needed to do was to prepare one more serving of food.In the past two years, whenever Su Zimo prepared the meals, he would bring one portion to the red-robed lady. He would put the food outside her room, knock on the door and leave.The red-robed lady rarely appeared, and Su Zimo had never seen her venture outside the mansion. The two of them had not even had a proper conversation before.The Su family and Ping Yang Town did not know of her existence.The lady\u2019s name was Die Yue. She was reclusive and was a person of few words. That was all that Su Zimo knew about her.Su Zimo had no idea since when Die Yue stood behind him. However, it seemed strange in the way Die Yue looked at him today. He could not put it into words.Su Zimo nodded towards her and went back to his room.Both of them had already become used to this form of greeting in the past two years. Besides, Su Zimo knew that even if he spoke to her, Die Yue would ignore him.Su Zimo shut the door, and took out a sharp knife with a one foot long handle from the corner. It was rusty. It seemed like it had not been used for ages.Su Zimo searched around before he took out a whetstone. He looked solemn as he sprinkled water on it. There was a cold glare in his eyes as he sharpened the knife.After a short while, Su Zimo seemed to think of something. He pushed the door open and looked at Die Yue who was at the courtyard. \u201cMiss Die Yue, have an early rest today. You must not come out of your room if you hear any sounds tonight.\u201dDie Yue made no comments, she remained cold and aloof.Su Zimo could not help but have a strange notion inside his head.Die Yue who was right in front of him resembled an immortal in terms of her temperament and the way she conducted herself. She was graceful and beyond worldly cares, indifferent to everything around her. A true immortal would never get angry and injure people just because a mortal refused to kneel down before him.Of course, this was just his thoughts. Su Zimo did not think too much about it.Su Zimo carried a jar of wine from the cellar in the courtyard. He dusted the mud off and deliberately spilled some strong wine on the way back to his room.Upon reaching the door, Su Zimo let go of the jar of wine and it shattered onto the floor. The wine was spilled all over the floor, giving off a strong smell.Die Yue witnessed the entire scene. There was a vague smile in the corner of her lips.Su Zimo went into the room but did not shut the door tightly, leaving it unlatched.Su Zimo went to the corner and continued to sharpen the knife.It was destined to be chaotic tonight.Su Zimo waited.He was waiting for a person\u2026\u2026The dark night had come.A sneaky figure trailed along the wall and slipped into Su Zimo\u2019s mansion.He made quite a large commotion when he landed on the floor. The dark figure rushed to the corner agilely.The dark figure waited for a while in the corner. The courtyard seemed quiet and there was not the slightest abnormality. The dark figure finally stood up and took out a dagger from his waist. The cold dagger glittered in the dark.Through the glitter of the dagger, one could vaguely tell that it was Zhou Dingyun who joined the immortal sect together with Shen Mengqi!Zhou Dingyun was one who sought revenge over the smallest grievance. Initially, he was wary of the Su family and Su Zimo who had scholarly honors.Now that Su Zimo was reduced to an inferior commoner, while he had joined the immortal sect, soaring to new heights, he would not let Su Zimo go easily.Besides, he would kill Su Zimo without anyone knowing tonight and leave Ping Yang Town with Perfected Cang Lang tomorrow.Even if the Su family realized the murder, they would not dare to make trouble, otherwise Perfected Cang Lang might exterminate their entire family when angered.Zhou Dingyun was not highly skilled except that he was strong and had physical strength. He believed that it would be easy to take down a frail scholar.He treaded carefully and smelled the fragrance of strong wine. He swept his gaze across the courtyard and noticed that there was a broken jar of wine in front of one of the rooms.\u201cHaha.\u201d Zhou Dingyun felt reassured. He grinned. \u201cIndeed, you have not suffered any setbacks before and decided to drown one\u2019s sorrows in wine. You must be dead drunk now. It is just nice. I will cut off the tendons of your hands and legs and take the time to torture you!\u201dZhou Dingyun swaggered to the door of the room. The room was unlatched. He peeped through the door and saw that there seemed to be a person lying on the bed. But the light was weak, therefore he could not see clearly.Zhou Dingyun did not stop to think but pushed the door open with a menacing look on his face, dashing into the room.There was an even stronger smell of wine in the room. Zhou Dingyun frowned and walked stealthily toward the bed.When he was about to reach the bed, a shadow came out from behind the door like a ghost.Suddenly!There was a cold light in the dark. Zhou Dingyun had yet to react and he could feel a cool touch to his neck. It was prickly and there was a cold voice next to his ears.\u201cMove and I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dZhou Dingyun felt a chill on his back. He had goosebumps all over his body.He might be physically strong, but Zhou Dingyun was unable to exert any strength.He knew very well that the thing that was on his neck was a sharp weapon, which could easily pierce through his throat.\u201cW-who are you?\u201dZhou Dingyun panicked, feeling as if his throat had been punctured, and warm liquid flowed down from his neck to his chest.The feeling was terrifying!It was as if his life was draining bit by bit but there was nothing he could do.All of a sudden, someone pulled Zhou Dingyun\u2019s hair by force and jerked him to the back!There was a tearing pain in his scalp. It felt as if it was close to being torn off from his head!\u201cAh!\u201dZhou Dingyun screamed in pain.Zhou Dingyun\u2019s legs went limp and he fell to his knees at the severe pain and life-threatening knife at his neck.Zhou Dingyun never felt so close to death.\u201cTake a look at who I am.\u201d The person behind him spoke up again. It was cold and eerie, as if the person was a ghost from hell, seeking his life.Zhou Dingyun threw his head back in an odd posture, widening his eyes to look upward.One glance at the person and Zhou Dingyun was terror-stricken.In the dark, Su Zimo did not have the scholarly aura of a scholar. His expression was grim and menacing. His eyes were sharp and scary. The expression in his eyes was colder than the sharp knife in his hands!At this moment, Zhou Dingyun could sense Su Zimo\u2019s determination and strong intention to kill.\u201cOh no! Now that Su Zimo had lost his scholarly honors and been reduced to an inferior commoner, he is serious about killing me!\u201d\u201cNo, I am joining the immortal sect. I can\u2019t die!\u201dThousands of thoughts fleeted through Zhou Dingyun\u2019s mind in that split second. They all morphed into a strong desire to survive.Zhou Dingyun quivered. \u201cY-you can\u2019t kill me. If others know about it, y-you can\u2019t escape death\u2026\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dSu Zimo smiled. \u201cMy life is worthless. I want to get someone to die with me. You are really down on your luck to come looking for me. You mustn\u2019t blame me.\u201dTo Zhou Dingyun, Su Zimo\u2019s smile in the dark seemed particularly eerie.Zhou Dingyun felt even more fear at his calm and indifferent tone.\u201cCrazy, Su Zimo is crazy!\u201dHe had barely shouted when Zhou Dingyun felt the slight movement of the sharp knife at his throat.Zhou Dingyun had a mental breakdown at the pulsating pain at his throat.\u201cS-Second Young Master Su, I beg you to spare my cheap life. I will never do evil in the future.\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master Su, I swear that even if I am lucky enough to join the immortal sect, I will never seek revenge on you. If not, I will suffer a painful death where countless of arrows pierce through my heart.\u201dSu Zimo was silent. He squinted his eyes and looked at Zhou Dingyun.Zhou Dingyun panicked further at the dead silence.Zhou Dingyun could not tell what was on Su Zimo\u2019s mind.Time trickled by. Just when Zhou Dingyun was close to despair, the grip on his scalp was loosened and the sharp knife on his neck was being removed slowly.\u201cScram.\u201dSu Zimo said coldly.To Zhou Dingyun, the word sounded like an immortal\u2019s voice. He felt as if he was being pardoned. He crawled and rolled, fleeing from the room.Zhou Dingyun covered the wound on his neck with his hand and ran to the courtyard, panting heavily.After the narrow escape from death, Zhou Dingyun gritted his teeth and had a malicious thought again.\u201cSu Zimo is after all a scholar. Previously he was prepared, but right now, he won\u2019t have chances of survival.\u201dThere was a murderous look in Zhou Dingyun\u2019s eyes. He could not help but turn to look toward the room.Su Zimo stood at the doorway. He was clad in green clothes, with a sharp knife that had a one-foot long handle in his right hand. His eyes were cold, he looked like a tiger that was capable of devouring humans. There was a murderous aura about him!There was a sense of ridicule in his expression, he seemed to have seen through Zhou Dingyun.Zhou Dingyun\u2019s evil thought vanished instantly.Zhou Dingyun had no idea about how deep the wound on his neck was, and he was clueless about whether Su Zimo had any other tricks up his sleeves. No matter what, he would not take the risk again.\u201cRevenge is a dish best served cold.\u201dWith that, Zhou Dingyun fled the mansion hurriedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But luckily, it was as what he had predicted.Su Zimo took note of a piece of information during the conversation with Shen Mengqi. She and Zhou Dingyun would leave Ping Yang Town with Perfected Cang Lang tomorrow.Su Zimo expected that Zhou Dingyun would definitely seek revenge tonight!Su Zimo had thought of seeking help from the Su family. But in this way, other than implicating the Su family, it would not change the outcome in any way.This was because Zhou Dingyun could not be killed.He was no longer the ruffian he used to be. Instead, he was about to join the immortal sect. If he died, Perfected Cang Lang would definitely come looking for him. By then, who would be able to stop him?Su Zimo had never killed anyone before. But when the knife touched Zhou Dingyun\u2019s throat, he was not the least nervous, scared or frightened. Instead, he was slightly excited and eager to try.He did not give a damn as to what would happen tomorrow. The sky might collapse or the ground might sink. He would be able to relieve his pent-up frustrations if he killed the bully. That would be so cool!Su Zimo indeed had the murderous intent and aura. He did not disguise it. He almost could not control himself and wanted to stab him with the knife!This was the first time that Su Zimo discovered that the blood that flowed inside of him was not the scholarly blood, but more of a general in the battlefield that was used to killing, or of those brutes who believed in an eye for an eye.He might used to have scholarly honors. But he was unable to stop the evildoers. Instead it was his sharp knife that sent them away.\u201cLong years of hard study could not be compared to the sharpness of the knife.\u201dSu Zimo laughed at himself. \u201cA scholar is indeed useless. He could only do this much.\u201dSu Zimo returned to the room. He threw the knife aside, lying on the bed, but he did not sleep at all.He was worried about one thing.Given Zhou Dingyun\u2019s temperament, he would definitely return to Ping Yang Town after cultivation and seek revenge for what happened today!He would meet his end then.It might be a month later, or perhaps a year later or ten years later.Nevertheless, Zhou Dingyun would definitely come back!Su Zimo knew it very well, but he had to tolerate the wicked acts of him today.That was because if he killed Zhou Dingyun, he would definitely die tomorrow. However, if he let Zhou Dingyun off, at least there was still a glimmer of hope.The glimmer of hope was that he would be able to gain the ability to fight against him before Zhou Dingyun came back after completing his cultivation.But, was that possible?What was a spirit root?Why did he not have a spirit root?Why could he not cultivate without a spirit root?Why\u2026Su Zimo felt confused. He was curious about the immortal sect and was bewildered about the future.Su Zimo\u2019s eyelids felt heavy and he drifted off to sleep.Su Zimo had a weird dream.In the dream, an immortal whispered into his ears. \u201cDo you want to cultivate?\u201dYes, Su Zimo would love to do that.Never before had he felt so eager to have power.Su Zimo felt that something was odd.Su Zimo was startled awake shortly after. He sat up suddenly. There was uncertainty in his eyes, and his back was drenched in cold sweat.He finally realized what was wrong.This was not a dream!Someone was really asking whether he wanted to cultivate.Su Zimo got up and opened the door, witnessing a scene that he would never forget in his entire life.There was an exquisite beauty next to the peach blossom tree in the courtyard. She was clad in a blood red robe. She stood there with sparkling eyes, watching him quietly.The clouds seemed to have dispersed, and the moonlight was clear as water. The petals of the peach blossoms fell off the tree and the lady was standing in the midst of it. It seemed as if there were mist and clouds in the twilight. This did not look like the mortal world.\u201cDo you want to cultivate?\u201dDie Yue asked once again. Her voice was gentle and pleasant, seeming somewhat lazy.Su Zimo took a deep breath and gradually calmed down. He had lots of questions and doubts. But he only manage to utter a single word. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d Die Yue replied casually. It was as if teaching Su Zimo was a simple chore like eating or dressing.Su Zimo walked down the stone steps and stopped in front of Die Yue. He gazed into her clear, watery eyes.Die Yue was gazing at him as well.After a while, Su Zimo realized that the lady in front of him was like a mystery. He could not see through her at all.On the contrary, Su Zimo felt as if he was seen through by Die Yue, and he could not hide any secrets from her.For a moment, Su Zimo had a flickering thought that Die Yue knew everything that happened to him today.She knew everything that he was thinking about!\u201cI have no spirit root.\u201d Su Zimo took a while before he said.\u201cThere is a cultivation technique that does not require spirit root.\u201d\u201cWhat cultivation technique is that?\u201d Su Zimo asked automatically.\u201cThe cultivation technique of the demon clan!\u201d Die Yue widened her eyes and there was a special aura about her.Su Zimo\u2019s countenance changed and he could not help but retreat half a step.Even though he knew nothing about cultivation, Su Zimo knew that human beings and demons belonged to different paths. According to legends, there were many cases where fiendish demons harmed human beings.Did he want to cultivate the cultivation technique of the demon clan and to become a fiendish demon who was bent on killing?It did not take long for Su Zimo to make up his mind.\u201cI\u2019ll learn.\u201dSu Zimo did not know what he would become in the future, but he knew that if he did not make use of this opportunity, soon afterwards, when Zhou Dingyun returned, he would certainly die, not to mention what would happen in the future.Die Yue was not surprised at all. It seemed she had expected Su Zimo would say yes. She continued on. \u201cIf you want to learn the cultivation technique of the demon clan, you have to agree to two conditions. Firstly, don\u2019t ask me about my identity or background, I will teach and you will learn. Secondly, you must not tell others of this cultivation technique.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Su Zimo nodded.Die Yue continued on. \u201cOne more thing, if you want to learn this cultivation technique, you will experience unimaginable dangers. You may lose your life at any time. Do not expect me to save you.\u201dSu Zimo smiled faintly. \u201cLife and death are preordained.\u201d\u201cIf there are any questions, you can go ahead and ask.\u201d Die Yue smiled lightly.This was the first time in two years that Su Zimo saw a smile on Die Yue\u2019s face. He marveled at her smile and seemed to be lost in it.But Su Zimo cleared his thoughts in the blink of an eye and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat is the spirit root? What is cultivation? Why did Perfected Cang Lang say that I can\u2019t cultivate without spirit root?\u201d\u201cCultivation, can also be called cultivation or cultivation of Dao. There are three oldest major schools of cultivation of the humans clan\u2014Immortal, Buddha, Fiend. The so-called spirit root is the immortal sect\u2019s way of calling it. For Buddhism, they called it as the root of wisdom, while the fiend sect called it as fiend seed. It is basically the same. As humans, if one doesn\u2019t have spirit root, one cannot join any of the sects.\u201dSu Zimo understood her words. What Die Yue meant was that demon cultivation did not need the spirit root.Die Yue continued. \u201cHumans have five senses, namely sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and the spirit root is equivalent to the sixth sense. It is the key to sense the aura between Heaven and Earth.\u201dSu Zimo suddenly saw the light.Without the spirit root, one could not \u201csee\u201d the aura of Heaven and Earth and one could not cultivate.Su Zimo continued to ask, \u201cAre there different realms to cultivation? Which level of cultivators does Perfected Cang Lang belong to?\u201d\u201cThe immortal sect can be divided into Qi Condensation Realm, Foundation Establishment Realm, Golden Core Realm, Nascent Soul Realm\u2026 He is a Golden Core Realm cultivator. There are different realms to demon cultivation, immortal cultivation, fiend cultivation and Buddha cultivation. It is just different means of achieving the same end. But no matter what, the path of Golden Core is the natural chasm that everyone has to pass through. There are many cultivators, but half of them would be stuck at the path of Golden Core, with no hope of success.\u201d\u201cCultivation is to be in defiance of the natural order and to seize the good aura of Heaven and Earth. Once one entered the path of Golden Core, it means that one breaks the shackles of Heaven and Earth for the first time. One\u2019s lifespan could increase to five hundred years. There is the saying that once one swallows an elixir, one\u2019s lifespan will not be decided by nature!\u201dDie Yue continued. \u201cThe cultivation technique that you are going to learn is divided into nine sections. The first section is Body Tempering, the second section is Tendons Transformation, the third section is Bones Strengthening, the fourth section is Marrow Cleansing, the fifth section is Organs Refinement, the sixth section is Orifice Clearing, the seventh section is Core Formation. If you want to take revenge, you must cultivate to the seventh section.\u201d\u201cWhat is the name of this cultivation technique?\u201d Su Zimo asked.\u201cThe Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness.\u201dSu Zimo was shocked. He could feel a strong, menacing aura surging toward him at the mention of the title. It was suffocating.\u201cBody Tempering, the first section of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, can be divided into two parts, to harden and refine the skin and flesh. There are different breathing and expiration methods, techniques and moves that correspond to it.\u201dThere was a demonic glitter in Die Yue\u2019s eyes. Thereafter, there were several lengthy and profound incantations in Su Zimo\u2019s mind.There were no mountain of immortals or clear waters, Grotto-heaven paradise, or bejeweled jade palace, Su Zimo had started on the path to cultivation right in the inconspicuous courtyard, under the peach blossom tree that was in full bloom!It seemed to be casual, and coincidental, but it also felt as if everything was predestined.Not long after, Su Zimo\u2019s expiration-inspiration gradually became different under Die Yue\u2019s guidance.This did not seem like the breathing method of normal humans.After being repeatedly corrected and going through countless practices, Su Zimo gradually seemed to get the hang of it.With this breathing and expiration, his body felt warm and his blood and flesh seemed to be burning and boiling, turning into boundless energy, bubbling to the surface of his skin.Su Zimo felt an itch in his skin.\u201cThis skin tempering breathing method originates from the Wild Bovine Demon King. One can practice when on the go or when sitting or sleeping. There is no definite posture to it. The bovine is resilient and has tough skin. Knife or sword will not be able to penetrate it. Take your time to appreciate it.\u201dSeeing that Su Zimo\u2019s breathing was gradually on the right track, Die Yue turned to go back to her room, not disturbing him.Su Zimo had long been immersed in this wonderful breathing and expiration method. He could feel that his skin had become tougher, stronger and more powerful with every breathing cycle.The night faded.Su Zimo had lost track of time. He even forgot where he was. He was focused on comprehending the incantations, and his breathing and expiration.The first ray of sunshine lit up part of the sky. Su Zimo was stunned to realize that something hard and strong seemed to be sticking out of his head, facing the sky! There were two of them!At this moment, Su Zimo seemed to have turned into an unrivaled bovine demon, taking in and breathing out the entire Heaven and Earth!\u201cMmm?\u201dDie Yue who was meditating in the room jolted. Her gaze pierced right through the walls to land on Su Zimo.\u201cHe actually understood the essence of it within such a short time? Oh\u2026 he is indeed a genius meant for demon cultivation. I have not wasted my efforts in giving him such a chance.\u201d There was a look of praise in her eyes. Although she did not make a single movement, strangely, she had ended up at the courtyard and appeared before Su Zimo.Bang!Su Zimo who was immersed in cultivation was hit by an external force all of a sudden. He flew to a small distance away and stopped his breathing and expiration exercise.Su Zimo got up from the ground, feeling slightly dizzy. He looked around, but there was no one in the courtyard.Su Zimo frowned as he saw Die Yue who stood in the distance.\u201cAre you courting death?\u201d Die Yue hid the look of praise in her eyes, and instead spoke in a cold tone.\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Zimo was dazed.Die Yue waved the sleeves of her robe and a sparkling water mirror emerged out of nowhere to appear in front of Su Zimo.Su Zimo looked dumbstruck. This was far beyond his imagination.When Su Zimo saw his own reflection in the water mirror, his surprise turned into panic!\u201cHow could this be?\u201dSu Zimo was originally on the thin side. But his reflection in the water mirror was far thinner than his original build. He seemed to be emaciated.If not for the familiar facial features and the contours of the cheek, Su Zimo could not believe that the person in the water mirror was himself.\u201cNo matter what kind of practice, the power will not appear out of thin air. Cultivators from the immortal, Buddha and fiend sects take in the aura of the Heaven and Earth into their bodies, while those stronger demons clan will use the essence of the sun and the moon to harden the body. You have yet to attain that realm. Therefore, whenever you breathe in and out, you are using the essence of your own blood and flesh. If this goes on, you will die in three days.\u201d\u201cWhat then?\u201d Su Zimo was startled.\u201cYou will naturally have to devour flesh and blood to supplement your energy before you continue with your cultivation.\u201dAt the mention of eating, Su Zimo\u2019s stomach began to growl. He felt severe pangs of hunger that almost drove him crazy.Su Zimo dashed straight to the kitchen in lightning speed. In less than a quarter of an hour, he made a clean sweep of everything edible in the kitchen and gobbled them down his stomach before he slightly eased his hunger.Su Zimo only discovered until now that he did not sleep all night. Not only did he not feel tired, instead he was energetic and full of strength.Su Zimo picked up the thin iron basin next to him and squeezed it.To his surprise, there were a few clear fingerprints on the iron basin!\u201cPsst! That powerful?\u201dSu Zimo was secretly amazed at himself.He underwent a huge change with a single night of cultivation. Su Zimo was full of confidence in the days to come.\u201cI suppose even if Zhou Dingyun comes back from the immortal sect, I will have the capability to spar with him.\u201dAt this time, Su Zimo still did not know the scariness of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. This cultivation technique was the supreme demon classic that disrupted the balance of Yin and Yang, seizing the good aura of Heaven and Earth, changing the universe and turning the vital energy. This was something that did not belong to this world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Tri Bovine StylePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosOn the second day, Su Zimo went to the market early in the morning to buy a few cattle as his food supply for the next few days.After putting them aside, Su Zimo went to Die Yue\u2019s room, knocking on the door. \u201cMiss Die?\u201dTo Su Zimo\u2019s surprise, the door slowly opened at his knocking.Although the sky was bright, the room was strangely pitch dark.\u201cCome in.\u201d Die Yue\u2019s voice could be heard coming from the room.Su Zimo took a deep breath and stepped into the room.Su Zimo could not help but feel odd. He seemed to have passed a soft and cold water curtain into another world.Su Zimo took a look and was startled.The sight in front of him was no longer Die Yue\u2019s room. Instead it was much more spacious than his mansion. He stood on a green lawn and there was a wooden barrel that was slightly more than half as high as normal humans.Die Yue sat slanted on a huge green stone, lazing around. Although she had a large blood red robe around her, it could not hide her slim and exquisite figure.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Su Zimo opened his mouth slightly.Die Yue had shown him a lot of incomprehensible prowess within a day. To him, it was strange and fascinating.\u201cThis is to insert the largest thing into the smallest one. You will understand when you reach a certain realm. There is no need to think too much about it right now.\u201d Die Yue replied, leaving no room for doubt. \u201cThis is the cultivation field that I have created. You will cultivate here in the future.\u201dDie Yue jumped down lightly from the green stone. \u201cI will teach you three more styles. These are called the Tri Bovine Style. Practice it in conjunction with the breathing and expiration method.\u201d\u201cThe first style is Plow Heaven Stride. Although there is only one style, it is ever changing. It is the only way to cultivate one\u2019s leg strength.\u201dWhile talking, Die Yue walked on the grass.Su Zimo widened his eyes and concentrated on what she was doing, staring at every step and movement of Die Yue, for fear that he would miss the details.After a few steps, Su Zimo vaguely grasped what Die Yue was talking about.There did not seem to be anything fascinating about her steps. But if he observed carefully, he discovered that Die Yue seemed to be making her way through muddy water.She drew in her chest slightly and erected the back, bending her knees and lowered her center of gravity. She never let her knees bend past her toes, but her strides were very wide!She seemed to have calculated the distance between each step. It was exactly the same!Die Yue stopped in her tracks, and turned to look at Su Zimo. \u201cYour turn.\u201dSu Zimo was not in a hurry to practice. Instead he stood in place for a long time to ponder before he took the first step.Su Zimo had just taken the first step and he sensed that he had made a mistake.Die Yue came to Su Zimo\u2019s side without any expression. She extended her leg and gave a slight kick at Su Zimo\u2019s extended leg.\u201cPsst!\u201dSu Zimo gasped.Die Yue\u2019s kick sent unbearable piercing pain down his thigh. He felt as if someone poked his legs mercilessly with needles.\u201cHold this position, continue.\u201d Die Yue\u2019s indifferent voice could be heard in the room.Su Zimo lowered his head and realized that after being kicked by Die Yue, the extended leg had a higher resemblance to Plow Heaven Stride.\u201cShe is helping to correct me.\u201d Su Zimo understood Die Yue\u2019s intentions.Su Zimo pursed his lips and tried to recall the stance of Plow Heaven Stride, making another stride with his left leg.\u201cWrong!\u201dThe sole of the foot had just touched the ground and Die Yue\u2019s voice could be heard again, followed by a piercing pain on Su Zimo\u2019s left leg.Su Zimo automatically corrected his stances under the stimulation of the pain in his leg.Su Zimo took a breather before taking another stride with his right leg.\u201cWrong!\u201dHe could feel the familiar sting again.Wrong!Stinging pain!He continued to practice and was being corrected over and over again\u2026In the end, Su Zimo could not even feel his legs. It was numb from Die Yue\u2019s constant kicks.Su Zimo clenched his teeth, drenched in perspiration. His only thought was that he had to keep walking.Time passed by without him knowing.Finally, he no longer heard the word \u201cwrong\u201d being hollered at him. It sounded like a nightmare to him.Su Zimo also realized that he had begun to understand the crux of Plow Heaven Stride.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what I taught you last night?\u201dSu Zimo suddenly saw the light with Die Yue\u2019s reminder. He began to use the breathing and expiration method that he learned yesterday night as he practiced Plow Heaven Stride.At the beginning, Su Zimo could not apply both of them together. He could not breathe properly after making a stride.But with the passage of time, Su Zimo gradually found a way to use the breathing method together with the Plow Heaven Stride.In fact, this breathing method coexisted with the Plow Heaven Stride. Su Zimo went faster and faster, and he no longer felt numbness in his legs. His flesh and blood seemed to be burning, and he had infinite strength in his legs, his strides became wider as well.He did not make any movement, but he was able to move five feet wide in a stride!Su Zimo was thrilled to know that he was learning it correctly.But Su Zimo could vaguely feel that his Plow Heaven Stride seem to be lacking something.Su Zimo automatically looked toward Die Yue who sat slanted on the green stone.Die Yue had a look of disdain on her face, her eyes cynical and morose.Su Zimo thought to himself, \u201cI am very skilled at using the breathing and expiration method with Plow Heaven Stride. Why does she still look down on me?\u201dSu Zimo felt angry, hence he deliberately practiced the Plow Heaven Stride, circling the green stone, moving about in front of Die Yue.Die Yue sneered after a short while. \u201cDo you intend to train yourself to become an ox? This stride is meant to plow the Heaven, it is not for you to plow the land!\u201dSu Zimo was startled. He stopped in his tracks.Die Yue floated down the green stone and went outside. She said coldly, \u201cWhen you can understand the profound meaning of \u2018plow heaven\u2019, you will then be able to master the essence of this set of footwork.\u201dSu Zimo finally realized what was missing in his Plow Heaven Stride.His every stride was supposed to plow a ravine out of the Heaven!How much boldness and vigor would one need to do that?Although he was skilled in this footwork, he lacked the vigor and boldness. Therefore, he could only be reduced to the cattle that plowed the land.\u201cPlow heaven, plow heaven\u2026\u201dSu Zimo kept pondering over it, and he gradually saw the light.Die Yue walked out of the room to the courtyard, with a faint smile on her face. Gone was the harsh and cold attitude that she displayed in front of Su Zimo.\u201cHe could achieve this with one day and one night of cultivation. He seems to be slightly better than me back then\u2026\u201dThe lady\u2019s whispers could be faintly heard under the peach blossom tree. But it was gone with the breeze.\u2026For a month, Su Zimo spent most of his time practicing Plow Heaven Stride in the cultivation field. He worked hard in grasping the essence of \u201cplow heaven\u201d and had a deeper understanding of the footwork.During this period, Su Zimo occasionally went out to buy some cattle and sheep and he vaguely heard some news.Success was a relative term. It brought so many relatives. The Shen family in Ping Yang Town used to be an ordinary family. But many pugilistic experts worked for the Shen family during this period of time.In the eyes of all, it was inevitable that the Shen family would rise to success. As long as Shen Mengqi succeeded in her cultivation, even if she made a one-time visit to her family, it was enough to bring success to the Shen family for generations. The pugilistic experts might even have the chance to join the immortal sect. They would not mind even if it was as their servants.On the contrary, the Su family had been in constant trouble lately.There were originally three large families, namely the Zhao family, the Lee family and the Yang family in Ping Yang Town. Su family rose to success in recent years. Furthermore, Su Hong was a Connate Expert, and Su Zimo had scholarly honors, therefore, the four families had been living in harmony.And now, Su Zimo\u2019s scholarly honors had been written off and he had been reduced to an inferior commoner. He also offended an immortal. The three families got restless and could not wait to take over the Su family\u2019s business in Ping Yang Town and there had been several conflicts and clashes between them.However, Su Zimo did not take these to heart.There was Uncle Zheng to take charge in the Su family, as well as Liu Yu and other Postnatal Experts to help out. The most important thing was that his older brother was not at Ping Yang Town now. When he was back, given his swift and harsh style, he would be able to suppress those evildoers.\u2026This day, Die Yue came up to Su Zimo and said, \u201cI will teach you the other two styles. Afterward, you can practice the three styles together.\u201dDie Yue paused for a while before continuing. \u201cMost of the styles in The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness are killing techniques. The next two styles are meant for killing. Bear that in mind.\u201d\u201cFirst style, Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing.\u201dDie Yue took a step forward, that was the stance of Plow Heaven Stride. She then leaned forward, her arms suddenly outstretched from the abdomen. She clenched her fists, with her index finger slightly raised. She dabbed her finger and shifted slightly upward.At this moment, Die Yue seemed to have disappeared right in front of Su Zimo. In replacement was a domineering bovine demon with its horns upraised!Die Yue\u2019s arms were the horns. The clenched fists with the raised joint of her index finger was the pointed part of the horn.\u201cPlow Heaven Stride is the foundation for Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing. Get into the Plow Heaven Stride stance, and exert force at the waist and abdomen, in the meantime throw out your fists. You must be able to charge toward the top as well as to do an upward thrust\u2026\u201dDie Yue explained in detail while Su Zimo listened attentively.Even so, when Su Zimo really practiced it, it was still inevitable that he suffered kicks from making mistakes. Die Yue stood by the side with a cold face. She would give him a kick whenever there was the slightest mistake.In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.Su Zimo was starving. He rushed to slaughter a cow. He prepared a wok and began to boil a pot of delicious beef.While waiting, Die Yue picked up the cow tongue that Su Zimo threw aside saying, \u201cTake the knife to stab at me.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Su Zimo was startled. He did not understand Die Yue\u2019s intention.Die Yue replied. \u201cI will teach you the third style. There is no way to show you how to do it. You will have to appreciate and understand the moment of change by yourself.\u201dSu Zimo knew that given Die Yue\u2019s abilities, even if he exerted all his force, he would not hurt her.Su Zimo gripped the knife and made a stab toward Die Yue\u2019s shoulder, while concentrating on watching her movements.Die Yue looked aloof. She raised the smooth and tender cow tongue and tapped it gently on the knife.\u201cPa!\u201dThere was a brittle sound. leaving Su Zimo gaping in shock.The cow tongue was intact, while Su Zimo was only left with a handle of the knife in his hands. The blade had shattered into pieces onto the ground!Su Zimo slaughtered the cow by himself. He knew that the cow tongue was just an ordinary tongue. It could never withstand the blow from the sharp knife.Moreover, Su Zimo could not tell that Die Yue had exerted any force just now. Otherwise, he would not be holding on to the handle. It would have flown out of his hands.This was just an ordinary cow tongue, but it shattered the sharp knife into pieces!If the cow tongue tapped on a man instead of a knife, would the person turn into powder?\u201cThe third style is called Bovine-tongued Saber. It may sound ordinary, but it represents the essence of this style.\u201d Die Yue continued. \u201cYou once asked me when would you know that you have made initial success at cultivating skin tempering? Let me tell you now. When your palm has the same force as this cow tongue, you will be considered as having initial success at it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Su family's MisfortunePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosSu Zimo often heard from other people that time passed by very fast when one cultivated. After he started cultivation, he finally realized what it meant.To his surprise, Su Zimo had spent three months in the cultivation field, and his body had undergone a total transformation.Others might not sense the change in Su Zimo, but he knew it very well.During this time, he was already skilled in using the two styles, Plow Heaven Stride and Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing. Coupled with the breathing and expiration method, Su Zimo\u2019s skin had toughened and was impenetrable to ordinary swords and knives!He felt immense strength in his every movement.The only thing that Su Zimo was distressed about was the Bovine-tongued Saber. He could not get the gist of it.At the cultivation field, Su Zimo took a deep breath, drew in his chest slightly and straightened his back, he took a step forward with his left foot, getting into the stance of Plow Heaven Stride.Originally, when Su Zimo stood there without moving, he looked like a frail scholar.But when he took a step forward, there was a drastic change in his aura. It was as if he had the whole sky under his foot!At the same time, Su Zimo exerted force at his waist and abdomen, punching his fists forward pointing and thrusting upward. He seemed to let out a mooing sound similar to bovines. It was deep and powerful, startling other people.When executing Plow Heaven Stride and Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing, it was natural and unforced. Coupled with the breathing and expiration method, it made them even more powerful.Die Yue who sat on the green stone saw this scene and nodded secretly.After executing Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing, Su Zimo continued by opening his fists and giving a harsh slap.The third style, Bovine-tongued Saber!Pa!The palm made a loud cracking sound in the air.Su Zimo sighed, shaking his head.There was still something off about it.The palm looked strong, but he was unable to execute the flexibility of Bovine-tongued Saber.Die Yue shifted her gaze elsewhere.It had only been three months, but Su Zimo was able to achieve this level. It had already exceeded her expectations.Bovine-tongued Saber was the most difficult and most powerful style among the Tri Bovine Style. It was useless to keep practicing. One would never comprehend the essence of it.One needed to have the power of understanding in order to grasp its essence. Otherwise, notwithstanding three months, one might not be able to succeed for three years or thirty years.Su Zimo felt frustrated after constantly failing at this style. He left the cultivation field and took a stroll in the courtyard, looking around.Inadvertently, Su Zimo\u2019s gaze fell on the cow that was chewing on the grass not far away and he stopped suddenly.It was the most common cow in the market. It was used by the farmers to plow the fields. It chewed the grass in its mouth and swallowed them into its belly. It then lowered its head, sticking out its tongue to sweep over a handful of tender grass, rolled them about and took them into its mouth.Su Zimo\u2019s eyes lit up and he suddenly saw the light.The tender grasses were the most common couch grass. Its leaves were thin and slender, and they had serrated edges. When Su Zimo was a child, he was scratched by the leaves accidentally.The cow tongue was so tender, but it had no fear of these couch grasses.The palm was the cow tongue, while the blade was the couch grass. This was the essence of Bovine-tongued Saber!Su Zimo was exhilarated. The scene where the cow ate the grasses kept coming up in his mind. He tried to comprehend the changes in that instant and thought it over and over in his mind, and began to practice automatically.\u201cI heard that the Su family had suffered a misfortune.\u201d\u201cIt was said that the Su family\u2019s restaurant was being smashed. I don\u2019t think it can open for business. I heard that someone died as well!\u201d\u201cIs it that serious?\u201dSu Zimo heard murmurs coming from outside the mansion, and he was startled from his cultivation.Su Zimo sobered up from his cultivation and his heart sank at the rumors. He pushed open the door and dashed to Su family\u2019s residence.Su Zimo overheard the discussion of others along the way, and roughly knew what was the cause of the misfortune this time.Several people picked quarrels and started trouble in the Su family\u2019s restaurant. They smashed the furniture and Uncle Zheng brought people with him to the restaurant. However, those people turned out to be Postnatal Perfected Experts. They came prepared and Uncle Zheng was injured instead.\u201cDamn, I can\u2019t take this lying down!\u201dSu Zimo had just arrived and he heard angry shouts coming from the house. He was Yuchi Huo. He was one of the guards at Su family, and he had a fiery temper.Everyone in the house was Su Zimo\u2019s trusted men. Su Zimo lost his parents when he was two years old. Uncle Zheng and others had been with the Su family for the longest time and they were very fond of him.In the beginning, it was these few people who helped his older brother to gain a foothold in Ping Yang Town. The brothers had a close relationship with these uncles.A strong smell of medicine wafted toward him and there was also a faint smell of blood.\u201cSecond Young Master is back.\u201dAlthough he had lost his scholarly honors, everyone in Su family were very respectful toward Su Zimo.Su Zimo nodded and went to check on the elder that laid on his sides on the bed.\u201cSecond Young Master.\u201d The old man\u2019s hair was white and his face was gaunt and yellow. He seemed to have one foot in the grave. Despite that, he still smiled at seeing Su Zimo. There was a tenderness in the way he looked at Su Zimo.Uncle Zheng was in charge of managing the Su household. Although he did not know martial arts, everyone in the Su family, including Su Hong showed respect toward him.Uncle Zheng had become thin and was getting on in years. Now that he was injured, it was still unknown whether he could survive or not.\u201cUncle Zheng, who is the other party?\u201d Although Su Zimo was boiling in anger, he appeared very calm, speaking softly at the bedside.\u201cWho else could it be? It must be the grandchildren of the three families, Zhao family, Lee family and Yang family!\u201d Yuchi Huo shouted in anger.\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d The man who spoke up was over 40 years old. He looked calm and composed. He was the leader of the Su family guards.\u201cUncle Liu, what do you mean?\u201d Su Zimo asked.Liu Yu looked at Su Zimo, swallowing back the words on the tip of his tongue.Yuchi Huo could not contain his anger, he hollered. \u201cLiu Yu, why are you being wishy-washy? Don\u2019t you know the seriousness of the situation? Mr Zheng was wounded by them, and Old Guan had suffered a terrible death. If those young lads under you were not smart, and broke out of the siege, Mr Zheng would have died. Those people wanted us dead!\u201d\u201cUncle Guan is dead?\u201d Su Zimo\u2019s heart ached at the news.When he was a child, Su Zimo often rode on Uncle Guan\u2019s shoulder, grabbing and clutching his hair.But no matter how much Su Zimo fooled around, Uncle Guan would never get angry at him. He would laugh it off and play with him.Su Zimo spoke through gritted teeth, \u201cWon\u2019t the authorities step in?\u201d\u201cThe authorities will be in charge of the affairs of the civilians. This is the conflict between several family clans. They would try all means to avoid it. Besides, whatever that is in the pugilistic society will be settled in the pugilistic way.\u201d Liu Yu shook his head.Su Zimo\u2019s voice sank. \u201cUncle Liu, what is going on?\u201dLiu Yu gave a slight sigh. \u201cMy guards followed those people and saw them entering Shen family\u2019s residence.\u201d\u201cThe people from Shen family are such ungrateful scumbags!\u201d Yuchi Huo smashed the table next to him with his fist, breathing angrily.Due to the relationship between Su Zimo and Shen Mengqi, the Su family rendered a lot of help to Shen family these past few years. Now that Shen Mengqi joined the immortal sect and skyrocketed to a top position, the Shen family turned to target the Su family.Liu Yu continued. \u201cI have done some investigations. The Shen family has been preparing to open a restaurant these days. Our restaurant is in their way.\u201dSu Zimo was expressionless as he listened to Liu Yu\u2019s analysis quietly.\u201cAhem!\u201dUncle Zheng coughed, panting slightly. \u201cAlthough the Shen family is the one who started it, the three families might have been adding momentum to it. This is the end of the matter, we shall wait until the Young Master is back.\u201d\u201cDo we just put up with it?\u201d Yuchi Huo gritted his teeth.Liu Yu sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s endure it for now. The fact that the Shen family has risen through the ranks within such a short period of time, I suspect that Connate Experts might be working with them. If we go to them without any plan, we might suffer even more casualties.\u201d\u201cWhen will Young Master return?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I guess he will be back soon.\u201dSu Zimo suddenly said, \u201cUncle Zheng, have a good rest, I will go out to take a breather.\u201dThat said, Su Zimo turned and left.\u2026Three months ago, Su Zimo\u2019s scholarly honors were written off and Shen Mengqi left the town. Zhui Feng was also dead. Su Zimo had been suppressing his anger and frustration at all that had happened.That was why he almost gave in to his urge to kill the ruffian with one stab that night.During this time, under Die Yue\u2019s guidance, Su Zimo had been working hard on his cultivation. But in fact, he had never forgotten his grievances and he still could not take it lying down.Now that the Su family suffered this misfortune, Uncle Zheng was seriously injured and Uncle Guan died a terrible death, all these events further sparked the anger in Su Zimo\u2019s heart.Su Zimo left the Su family\u2019s residence. This was his only thought in mind\u2014those people had gone too far in bullying them!Su Zimo had some vague idea of the differences between Connate and Postnatal in the pugilistic society.Postnatal and Connate were divided into early-stage, mid-stage, late-stage and perfected. His older brother, Su Hong was an early-stage Connate Expert.Su Zimo had no idea which stage he belonged to. He was clueless as to which expert and from which stage could he handle.In Su Zimo\u2019s opinion, he had only cultivated for three months, he would not be able to defeat others who had cultivated for more than 10 years.Despite that, Su Zimo had to demand an explanation from the Shen family. After all, he had spent more than ten years studying. He believed that everything must be based on reasons.The Shen family had to give him an explanation!Shortly after, Su Zimo reached the Shen family\u2019s residence.In just three months, the Shen family had undergone tremendous changes, changing from an ordinary family to the prestigious Shen family now. On the two sides of the vermilion red door stood two majestic stone lions.If Su Zimo did not remember its location by heart, he would never believe that this was Shen Mengqi\u2019s house.Su Zimo walked up the stairs. He did not bother to knock, but pushed the door open.At this moment, many people were gathered at Shen family\u2019s residence. They were happily drinking, laughing and chatting with each other.Now that Su Zimo suddenly barged into the residence, the crowd in the courtyard slowly dispersed. Many of them stopped whatever they were doing, staring at Su Zimo with a grim expression on their faces.These people seemed wild and uncultivated, looking ferocious. Their cold and flashing weapons were placed by the side.One of them had sharp eyes and recognized Su Zimo, speaking in a peculiar tone. \u201cOh, isn\u2019t this Second Young Master Su, the successful candidate in the imperial provincial examination in Country of Da Qi? Why do you have the time to grace Shen family\u2019s residence?\u201d\u201cHaha, you must not have known. Second Young Master Su\u2019s scholarly honors had been written off. Right now, he is a big idler.\u201dThe ruffians of the pugilistic society ridiculed Su Zimo one after another. They stared at him with obvious evil intentions, and they hit their weapons against each other to send sparks flying, creating the piercing sounds of metal clashing against each other.If he was just an ordinary scholar, he would have gone limp in his legs at the current situation, where he was surrounded by menacing ruffians.However, Su Zimo maintained the same expression, and he even moved to stand in the center of the courtyard.Back then when Su Zimo had yet to start cultivating, he was brave enough to confront Perfected Cang Lang at the unjust treatment. Right now, the ruffians in front of him were worlds apart from Perfected Golden Core. They did not exude the same vigor and aura like him. There was no way that he would be scared of them.Su Zimo maintained a calm expression while his eyes swept across the courtyard, speaking calmly, \u201cI want to see Shen Nan.\u201dShen Nan was Shen Mengqi\u2019s older brother.\u201cHehe, Second Young Master Su came uninvited. Please pardon me for not welcoming you.\u201dThe voice was heard first before seeing the person himself.Su Zimo turned his gaze to the direction where the sound was coming from. A man in a white robe slowly walked over from the long corridor of the courtyard. He was all smiles, but he did not make any effort to conceal the mockery in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed like a rich man\u2019s son.But everyone in Ping Yang Town knew of his background. Shen Nan used to be the manager of the Su family\u2019s restaurant. He was given the job on account of Su Zimo.Shen Nan took a cup of wine next to him and walked up to stand in front of Su Zimo, passing the cup of wine to him, putting on a fake smile. \u201cWelcome Second Young Master Su. No matter what, I have to serve you wine. Please accept it.\u201d\u201cRegarding what happened today, whose idea was it?\u201d Su Zimo ignored him but asked him softly.Shen Nan maintained the smile on his face, leaning his head to the side, pretending not to know. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what Second Young Master Su is talking about.\u201d\u201cShen Nan, I want an explanation. Who is the murderer?\u201d Su Zimo stared at Shen Nan\u2019s eyes, but his tone remained very calm.Shen Nan raised his eyebrow, putting away his smile. He looked upward and finished the cup of wine as he said lightly, \u201cIt seems that Second Young Master Su wants to make things difficult!\u201dWith that, Shen Nan threw the cup in his hand onto the ground, smashing it into pieces.All the ruffians in the courtyard stood up at the sound, unsheathing their weapons from their scabbards. All of them looked menacing and eager to fight.\u201cDamn, I can no longer stand this guy. Did he really think that he is a young master? He is merely an inferior-class commoner. We gave him a way out but he refused!\u201d\u201cI am Mo Song. I am the one who slaughtered the man by the surname of Guan!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s me as well.\u201d\u201cHehe, it\u2019s a pity that the old man did not die under my palm.\u201dSu Zimo swept his gaze over everyone who spoke up. He nodded and said, \u201cVery well, very well.\u201dShen Nan sneered. \u201cSu Zimo, don\u2019t seek trouble for yourself. Today I will take into account your relationship with my sister and let\u2026\u201d\u201cScram!\u201dShen Nan was not finished, but he was interrupted by Su Zimo\u2019s holler.Everyone in the courtyard found it weird and unbelievable. Shen Nan looked ferocious as he said coldly, \u201cHow dare you scold me?\u201dSu Zimo glared at him.Shen Nan was taken aback by his sharp gaze. He had yet to recover and Su Zimo made his move.Su Zimo did not make any other movement. He stretched his palms and slapped Shen Nan on the face.Pa!After being slapped by Su Zimo, Shen Nan was sent ten feet away under the watchful eyes of everyone!Shen Nan had been practicing martial arts for the past three months and he had made huge improvements, achieving the Postnatal early-stage. He could not imagine that he would fly away after being slapped by Su Zimo.The other party was not being swift in his attack. Why could he not react in time?In the eyes of the ruffians, they had different views to Su Zimo\u2019s attack.No ordinary man would be able to send people ten feet away with the strength of the palm.But everyone present survived through battles and fights. Many of them were Postnatal Experts. Mo Song and several others were Postnatal Perfected. They thought nothing of Su Zimo.\u201cKill him for me!\u201dShen Nan\u2019s cheek was swollen and there was blood at the corner of his lips. He laid on the ground and hollered as he pointed his finger at Su Zimo.Without waiting for Shen Nan\u2019s orders, Mo Song already led a group of men to slash at Su Zimo. They attacked him from all sides, it was frightening!Although Su Zimo had been cultivating for three months, he only knew three styles and he had never engaged in a fight with others.Su Zimo felt a slight panic at the current situation. He automatically used Plow Heaven Stride, and charged toward Mo Song.Swish!Su Zimo took two steps forward, covering a distance of more than ten feet. His speed was alarming and he managed to escape from most of the attacks directed at him.The rest of the people seemed to have blurred vision. A shadow flashed past them and their knives and swords missed the target.\u201cNo!\u201dMo Song\u2019s eyelids kept twitching. His countenance changed.The other people could not tell, but Mo Song who was at the front shivered at the monstrous force that was directed at him when Su Zimo took two steps forward!Su Zimo was no longer a feeble scholar. He was obviously a ferocious beast that devoured humans!Mo Song had yet to recover from his shock and therefore he was slow to react.By then, Su Zimo had already reached Mo Song\u2019s side. He stretched his arms from under his abdomen, clenching his fists with the joint of his index finger slightly raised, thrusting and pushing forward!Su Zimo was very familiar with these series of movements. He would be able to execute it with precision even when he shut his eyes.And right now, Su Zimo directed all his pent-up frustrations in the past three months in his attack.Poof!Everyone turned silent.Mo Song had an odd expression on his face. He lowered his head slowly and realized there were two bloody hollows as huge as bowls in his chest. Two muscular arms were protruding from the hollows.The blood was gone from Mo Song\u2019s face. He slanted his head and died on the spot!In the eyes of the other people, the two sides had only sparred with each other for a single round. Mo Song had yet to land his saber on Su Zimo, and the latter had already driven his arms into Mo Song\u2019s chest!Two bloody fists were seen protruding from the back of Mo Song\u2019s chest. It was a terrifying sight.Although the ruffians of the pugilistic society had been through many fights, they could not imagine the scene that they had just witnessed. How could a fist drive a hole through blood and flesh?A Postnatal Perfected Expert was taken down by a frail scholar!Who would have believed it if they had not seen it themselves?Murder!Su Zimo was in a daze. All he could remember was that Die Yue once told him lightly, \u201cMost of the styles in The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness are killing techniques\u2026\u201dThere were killing techniques. If he used them, he would definitely take lives!Until now, Su Zimo finally understood her words.Someone waved a knife to hack at Su Zimo\u2019s neck while he was in a daze, while another person attacked him with a sword, stabbing him in the middle of his back.Clang! Clang!Instead of the sounds made by the weapons when they pierced through human flesh, one could only hear the sounds similar to the clashing of metals.The steel knife that was on Su Zimo\u2019s neck strangely bounced up, while the long sword in the middle of his back bent into an arc. It could not stab into his flesh!\u201cPsst!\u201dEveryone present gasped.Su Zimo might have worn superior-class armor and hence the sword could not stab through his flesh. But what about the steel knife that slashed his neck? There was no way to explain why it bounced back?Corporal mortification martial arts?What kind of corporal mortification martial arts would be so powerful?Although the knife and sword did not hurt Su Zimo, he staggered from the force of it.The skin tempering skill could block the cutting edge of the knife and sword, but it could not block the force directed at him through the knife and sword. Su Zimo felt immense pain in the middle of his back and neck. He gritted his teeth to endure the pain.\u201cScoundrel, you must be courting death!\u201dSu Zimo hollered, executing Plow Heaven Stride and charged toward the person on the left.Bang! Bang!Su Zimo plowed and made two deep ravines out of the ground that was made of extremely hard green stone. The gravel and small stones flew around, it was a frightening sight!The person\u2019s countenance changed. He finally knew the fear and terror Mo Song felt in the final moments before his death.Su Zimo was too imposing and terrifying!He merely strode forward, but the menacing aura about him was enough to suffocate him.Poof!He executed Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing, making two hollows in the chest of a late-stage Postnatal Expert. He died on the spot.Seeing that Su Zimo seemed immune to swords and knives, everyone had no idea how to take him down.Su Zimo had killed two men consecutively in no time. His blood seemed to be boiling. The initial panic and tension had disappeared.\u201cAnd you!\u201dSu Zimo turned and directed his fiery gaze at the last person.The person had boasted of wounding Uncle Zheng just now. But he felt a chill at his back and had goosebumps all over his body now that Su Zimo fixed his gaze on him.\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s attack him at once. No matter how powerful his corporal mortification martial arts is, he would definitely have a vital gate, and there is a limit to his endurance!\u201d The man hollered.Everyone in the courtyard felt like taking him down together, but they were still wary of him. They were frightened by his menacing aura and they did not attack at once.Ta! Ta! Ta!Su Zimo took three steps and had already arrived in front of the man in no time. He executed Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing without another word.The man already realized that Su Zimo only executed the few styles.Although he was frightened by the sheer power of Plow Heaven Stride, he was able to avoid the attack by dropping to the ground agilely. He did not care to preserve his dignity, but to execute a Lazy Donkey Roll.Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing was meant to attack one\u2019s waist and upper abdomen.The man counterattacked with the move and was able to avoid Su Zimo\u2019s fists.Even so, he could still smell a strong and musty smell of blood in the air, extinguishing all his desire to fight back.\u201cRun! He is invincible!\u201dThe man managed to escape from his Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing. Su Zimo watched as his opponent rolled about on the floor, feeling somewhat confused.This was the only movement technique that he knew.If Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing was unable to kill the opponent, Su Zimo had no other way to defeat him.Right then, a thought came to Su Zimo\u2019s mind and he took big strides to catch up with the opponent.Lazy Donkey Roll might be a brilliant move and when used occasionally, it was quite effective. However, his speed of rolling on the floor would not be as fast as his running legs.Su Zimo roared and caught up to the man in no time.The man heard Su Zimo\u2019s roar and knew that he was in serious trouble, looking upward at him.His view was blocked by flying gravel and stones. Right then, an enormous force smashed right into his chest.Bang!The next moment, the man smashed against the wall, and he slowly slipped off the wall seconds later. His chest was punctured and he died on the spot.Su Zimo was able to react according to circumstances, using the brute force of Plow Heaven Stride to kick at the man.Killing techniques!Plow Heaven Stride was a killing technique as well!Several experts at the courtyard who were jeering at Su Zimo turned silent. There was fear in their eyes. Everyone retreated slowly, for fear that they would be Su Zimo\u2019s next target.It was understandable that everyone was fearful of him. Su Zimo had displayed very formidable prowess.It had only been ten minutes since he made his first move and he had already killed two Postnatal Perfected Experts and one late-stage Postnatal Expert!Su Zimo sneered as he turned to walk toward Shen Nan who had turned pale in fright.\u201cW-what do you want?\u201dShen Nan\u2019s voice trembled. He wanted to turn and flee, but his legs were too weak. They gave way on him and he could only sit limply on the ground, while he inched slowly away from Su Zimo.\u201cWhose idea was it today?\u201d Su Zimo towered Shen Nan, looking down at him, as he posed his question, enunciating each word slowly.\u201cN-no, it\u2019s not me\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is it?!\u201d Su Zimo roared with anger.Shen Nan trembled, gasping for air. There was a flicker of malice in his eyes as he said through gritted teeth, \u201cIf you dare to wound me, Su family will be exterminated!\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s expression darkened. He squinted his eyes. \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201dSu Zimo had barely suppressed his murderous intent, but he could feel the strong urge to kill again.Right then, an eerie and sorrowful sound could be heard from the inner hall of Shen family\u2019s residence.\u201cYou are a junior, you must be courting death. How dare you behave so atrociously here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Connate ExpertPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosThe voice was still resonating and the figure that was as fast as a ghost swooshed and appeared right before him.Su Zimo took a careful look. He was a middle-aged man. His cheeks were gaunt but he had eagle-like sharp eyes. He merely pointed his toes on the ground and he covered the distance in no time, standing right in front of him.Su Zimo was shocked.The middle-aged man was much stronger than the crowd in the courtyard in terms of his movement technique and aura!Connate Expert!\u201cBuzz!\u201dThe middle-aged man hid his hand behind his back. He suddenly stretched out his hand and it was accompanied by a clear buzzing sound of the sword.A cold longsword stabbed towards Su Zimo\u2019s face. The tip of the sword trembled like a flexible poisonous snake, giving out tongue-lashing sounds. It was disturbing.The sword had yet to reach him, but a gush of cold air blew against his face. Su Zimo felt slight pain on his face.Su Zimo realized that given the strength and toughness of his skin right now, he could never stop this sword!The power of the Connate Expert was enough to threaten his life.After all, Su Zimo barely had any fighting experience. He lost his focus just now and missed the chance to make the first strike.Even if Su Zimo executed Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing to withstand the force from the sword, his head would already be pierced through by his sword.Retreat!Su Zimo had no time to think. He executed Plow Heaven Stride and retreated quickly.\u201cHumph!\u201dThe middle-aged man sneered loudly, increasing his speed and his sword followed Su Zimo right on his heels. There was no way that Su Zimo could escape from his advancing sword. The tip of the sword was within distances of Su Zimo\u2019s face.The situation was very dangerous for Su Zimo!Su Zimo could only see the glitter of the sword in front of him. His eyes hurt and he could not help but shed tears.Right then, there was a look of malice in the middle-aged man\u2019s eyes.\u201cOh no, there is the wall right behind me!\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s heart sank.The courtyard of the Shen family\u2019s residence might be spacious, but there was a boundary as well. Both parties were advancing and retreating in a superior speed and in the blink of an eye, Su Zimo had been forced to retreat to the wall.There was no way to retreat!Even if Su Zimo used brute force to break the wall, there would be a moment of delay.The middle-aged man was able to slash Su Zimo with his sword in that single moment!\u201cStop!\u201dA figure suddenly barged in from the door, carrying a steel saber in his hand. The figure yelled and charged aggressively towards the middle-aged man.\u201cIt\u2019s Uncle Liu.\u201dAlthough Su Zimo could not afford the slightest distraction to check the person who arrived, he could tell from the voice the identity of the person.The middle-aged man took a glance and sneered.Liu Yu was only a Postnatal Perfected. Even if he was a Connate Expert, he would not be able to save Su Zimo.There was only a stone\u2019s throw distance away between the long sword and Su Zimo!\u201cIt\u2019s too late, he will die for sure!\u201dThe middle-aged man snarled lightly. His expression turned cold as he charged forward with his sword.In this moment of life and death, Su Zimo suddenly calmed down, there was not the least bit of panic in his eyes. He was unexpectedly calm and his senses became sharper than usual.Su Zimo knew very well that he was the only one who was capable of saving himself.Faced with the advancing sword, Su Zimo closed his eyes instead and the scene of cattle grazing grass in the cultivation field flashed in his mind.Su Zimo raised his palm automatically and rested it on the body of the advancing sword.Wrap, hit, pull!Bovine-tongued Saber, the most powerful style among the Tri Bovine Style!Pa!A crisp sound that was as loud as thunder resonated in the courtyard of Shen family\u2019s residence.The next moment, everyone froze on the spot. There were confusion, doubt, and disbelief in their eyes.The long sword in the middle-aged man\u2019s hands was shattered into multiple fragments, he was left with nothing but the hilt of the sword. The fragments scattered onto the ground. There was a strange brilliance about them.The middle-aged man opened his mouth, his pupil constricted suddenly, as he looked at Su Zimo who was not far from him. He did not advance, instead he retreated a few steps and looked wary.Su Zimo opened his eyes, panting slightly. He looked somewhat confused.Had he survived?Moments ago, Su Zimo finally realized what death felt like.Until now, Su Zimo still felt that everything was surreal.There was a breeze in the air. Su Zimo\u2019s back was drenched in perspiration. He was so terrified that he broke out in cold sweats.\u201cHurry, let\u2019s go!\u201dRight then, Su Zimo could hear Liu Yu\u2019s voice by his ear. Liu Yu pulled him by the arm and he automatically followed Liu Yu to run out of Shen family\u2019s residence.Apart from everyone present in the Shen family\u2019s residence, Su Zimo himself was unable to recover himself. He was in a state of confusion as he hung his head and ran with Uncle Liu.Along the way, Liu Yu kept looking at Su Zimo.Before this, not long after Su Zimo left Su family\u2019s residence, Uncle Zheng told him that Second Young Master looked odd. He was worried that he might go to the Shen family\u2019s residence to demand an explanation, and he ordered Liu Yu to protect him.By the time he reached Shen family\u2019s residence, he already saw the middle-aged man attacking Su Zimo.Liu Yu had good eyesight, he could tell that the man was a Connate Expert.He did not understand why Su Zimo, a feeble scholar provoked a Connate Expert? The situation was critical and he had no time to think. All he could do was to make the first move to save Su Zimo.However, the scene that Liu Yu saw thereafter was a huge shock to him.Liu Yu\u2019s eyes kept lingering on Su Zimo\u2019s palm. He had lots of doubts and he wondered what was going on. \u201cCould it be that Second Young Master put on an armor-like glove? But even so, how much power would he need to shatter the long sword of the Connate Expert to pieces?\u201dThe most puzzling thing was that he could not tell that Su Zimo had been practicing martial arts. In fact, he seemed thinner than before.\u201cWeird.\u201dLiu Yu had an idea and decided to test Su Zimo. He released his grip on Su Zimo, and increased his speed.Su Zimo hung his head, looking absent-minded. He seemed to be deep in his thoughts, but he followed right behind Liu Yu automatically.Liu Yu and Su Zimo reached Su family\u2019s residence in no time.There were beads of perspiration on Liu Yu\u2019s forehead and he was breathing heavily, but he could not hide the surprise in his eyes.He sped up thrice consecutively on the way back. To the end he had already reached his limit, but Su Zimo was still following closely behind.The most scary thing was that Su Zimo was breathing like usual, and he did not seem as if he was tired or exhausted. It was obvious that he still had a lot of energy!Su Zimo had finally recovered himself upon reaching Su family\u2019s residence.Actually, Su Zimo was just as shocked as everyone.Although Su Zimo could tell more or less that The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness was extraordinary, he did not expect that he would have such power after cultivating for merely three months.Su Zimo looked at his palm.There was no injuries.Success!Su Zimo had mastered Bovine-tongued Saber during the life and death moment just now.Su Zimo was overjoyed and thought of sharing the news with Die Yue later and to show off to her.But then, Su Zimo seemed to sense something and he looked up to see that Liu Yu was staring at him with an odd expression.\u201cWhat is wrong, Uncle Liu?\u201d Su Zimo asked.Liu Yu said in a low voice, \u201cNothing, go on in. You should rest in your room, I will look for you later.\u201dSu Zimo nodded.Liu Yu sent Su Zimo away and went directly to Uncle Zheng\u2019s room, telling everything that he saw at Shen family\u2019s residence to him.Everyone in the room was surprised.If not for the fact that it was Liu Yu who told them, no one would believe it.\u201cCould it be that Second Young Master is a Connate Expert?\u201d Yuchi Huo asked.Liu Yu shook his head. \u201cPeople who practiced martial arts would have significant changes in their physique. For instance, the temple will bulge and the knuckles will be bigger. There will be calluses on the hands and one will have a strong physique. But I don\u2019t see these changes in Second Young Master. He does not have any calluses and he has long fingers. It doesn\u2019t seem as if he has used a weapon before.\u201dUncle Zheng also said, \u201cSecond Young Master has spent all his time on studying, he didn\u2019t have the chance to practice martial arts. It\u2019s impossible that we not know about it. What\u2019s more, one would need to practice for 10 years before one can advance to a Connate. And we are referring to those who are gifted and cultivated and practiced the mental cultivation method and internal power. Second Young Master is still so young.\u201dLiu Yu thought about it and said, \u201cOn the way back, I deliberately tested Second Young Master and I can be certain that his movement technique is faster and above me!\u201dAh!Everyone was shocked.As the leader of the Su family guards, although Liu Yu was not well-versed in movement technique, he ranked the top ten in terms of his speed.Uncle Zheng frowned and asked, \u201cDid Second Young Master cultivate some superb qinggong?\u201dThere were superior qinggong in the pugilistic society that were similar to \u201cchasing toad in eight steps\u201d. After cultivation, one was as light as the swallow and it could indeed increase the speed of one\u2019s movement technique.\u201cUnlikely.\u201d Liu Yu shook his head and said, \u201cSecond Young Master merely kept up with me without using any martial arts. He did not use any clever moves.\u201dEveryone was puzzled.Liu Yu said in a low voice, \u201cIf I am correct, the middle-aged man is Tang Mingjun, he is known as the \u201cSoul Reaping Sword\u201d. He is an early-stage Connate Expert.\u201d\u201cThis does not make sense. Why will a Connate Expert attack Second Young Master? Won\u2019t it be a disgrace to him?\u201d Uncle Zheng frowned slightly.What Uncle Zheng meant was that if the person wanted to kill Second Young Master, he could send anyone who had practiced martial arts. There was no need for a Connate Expert to do it?Actually, Liu Yu arrived too late in time, he did not see that Su Zimo had killed three people consecutively.By the time he arrived, Su Zimo was in a dangerous situation. Liu Yu had yet to take in the surroundings around him and he brought Su Zimo to flee from Shen family\u2019s residence.No one present would have known that it was not that Tang Mingjun, the \u201cSoul Reaping Sword\u201d wanted to attack Su Zimo, in fact, he was forced to do it.\u201cOh no!\u201dRight then, one of the Su family guards pushed the door open, looking alarmed and panic. \u201cThere are many people outside. They look aggressive, saying that they want Second Young Master to pay a life for a life.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t panic, who are these people?\u201d Liu Yu asked in a deep voice.\u201cThey are from Zhao family and Lee family. Shen Nan from the Shen family also brought many people with him!\u201d The Su family guard swallowed with difficulty before he replied, breathing heavily.\u201cA life for a life?\u201dUncle Zheng spoke softly, deep in his thoughts.If according to what Liu Yu said, Su Zimo did not kill anyone in the Shen family, why would they demand him to pay a life for a life?\u201cDamn, this is a clear provocation. How could Second Young Master kill someone? I will go out to meet them!\u201d Yuchi Huo was riled up. He stood up and dashed outside.\u201cWait!\u201dUncle Zheng coughed before he said softly, \u201cHelp me out.\u201d\u201cMr Zheng, you must not move about so as not to aggravate your injuries.\u201d Liu Yu hurried to stop him.Uncle Zheng shook his head. His attitude was firm. \u201cHe who comes is surely ill-intentioned. Now that Young Master is not around, I have to take a look no matter what.\u201dThe few of them from the Su family went out to take a look and their hearts sank.There were hundreds of people outside the residence. All of them looked menacing and most of them were Postnatal pugilistic experts. Three of them were early-stage Connate Experts. Tang Mingjun was one of them.Given Su family\u2019s manpower and capabilities now, if they did not deal with this properly, all of them might end up dead!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone, try to take things lying down and don\u2019t take the offensive. We must wait until Young Master is back.\u201d Uncle Zheng whispered.Everyone in the Su family was shocked.Mid-stage Connate!Liu Yu whispered. \u201cThe man looks unfamiliar, he might not belong to Ping Yang Town. Be on your guard.\u201d\u201cWhere is Su Zimo? Get him to come out!\u201d Shen Nan covered his swollen face and shouted angrily.Liu Yu stepped forward, and said in a deep voice with cupped fists. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the crowd? Why do you want to look for Second Young Master?\u201dA young man in a brocade robe who was one of the leading men held a folding fan in his hands and smiled. \u201cA life for a life. It\u2019s right and unalterable. Second Young Master Su had to pay for killing people.\u201dThe person was Zhao Yu, Young Master Zhao. He was a Postnatal Perfected, he was well-known in Ping Yang Town.The person next to him was Lee Yuanmao, Young Master Lee.\u201cTo hell with you!\u201dYuchi Huo pointed to Zhao Yu, ranting out loud. \u201cIf you insist to pay a life for a life, you must do so first. You have taken Brother Guan\u2019s life!\u201dUncle Zheng had a severe cough, gasping for breath. \u201cWhat proof do you have that Second Young Master has taken three lives?\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dShen Nan grinned hideously. \u201cOld man, everyone in Shen family witnessed how Su Zimo killed them.\u201dWith that, the people from Shen family edged to the front carrying the corpses of Mo Song and the rest.Although they were dead, they did not shut their eyes. There were terror and fear in their eyes. It went to show that they were greatly shocked moments before their deaths.Liu Yu and the rest were taken aback when they saw the corpses.It was too ruthless!The chests of two of them seemed to have been pierced through by weapons that were as thick as arms, while the chest of the other person collapsed and his bones were shattered.Uncle Zheng swept his gaze over them, remaining calm as he shook his head. \u201cHe who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick. Everyone in Ping Yang Town knows that Second Young Master is a scholar, How can he possibly kill these three Postnatal Experts?\u201d\u201cEnough of your nonsense!\u201dZhao Yu spread out his paper fan, saying coldly, \u201cIf the Su family doesn\u2019t hand Su Zimo over, all of you will have to die today!\u201d\u201cI am the one who killed them!\u201dAt this time, a voice came from outside the crowd, and everyone turned toward the sound. A green-robed scholar strode up with big steps, his head high and chest out. It was Su Zimo.Su Zimo stood in front of everyone from the Su family, displaying no fear at the hundreds of people in front of him, giving a loud shout. \u201cI killed them, I will take responsibility for it!\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master, don\u2019t be impulsive.\u201d Yuchi Huo stopped him.Liu Yu whispered. \u201cSecond Young Master, they have evil intentions. They are after other motives. It is just an excuse to look for you. Don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dLee Yuanmao had a strange smile. \u201cSince Second Young Master Su has admitted to it, things are simple. Get him!\u201d\u201cProtect Second Young Master.\u201d Uncle Zheng\u2019s tone was firm and steady. \u201cAt no costs!\u201dClang!Everyone unsheathed their weapons. Liu Yu and the rest surrounded Su Zimo and Uncle Zheng, protecting them from the crowd. The two parties were on the verge of breaking into fights.Zhao Yu kept his folding fan and coldly said, \u201cCapture Su Zimo. Kill all those who stand in the way!\u201dSu Zimo clenched his fists, getting ready to execute Plow Heaven Stride. He wanted to dash into the crowd to fight with the Connate Experts.In all fairness, he could hardly deal with the early-stage Connate Experts. Moreover, there was a mid-stage Connate Expert among them. But right now, there were no other options.Suddenly!Galloping sounds could be heard from afar. In no time, it was nearing them.\u201cI will kill whoever who dares to touch my younger brother!\u201d Su Hong shouted.The crowd dispersed, as a single man rode a horse and galloped toward them, full of murderous intent. He tightened the reins upon reaching Su family\u2019s residence.The man rode on a tall horse and held an iron spear of the flowing spring. There was a powerful and murderous aura about him. His gaze was fiery and one dared not look him in the eyes.There was a hideous scar on the person\u2019s face. It stretched from his glabella to his earlobe. Although it had healed, the tender red skin near the wound was protruding from the scar. It looked frightening and the person looked even more vicious with it.Su Hong, Young Master Su!Everyone in the Su family was glad to see him. They could not conceal their joy at seeing him.\u201cZhao Yu, Lee Yuanmao, have the two of you matured? How dare you seek trouble at the Su family?\u201d Su Hong did not get off the horse. Instead, he sat on the horse, looking down on the two of them, his tone icy cold.\u201cHaha, so it\u2019s Young Master Su. You have come at the right time. I have been waiting for you for a long time.\u201d Zhao Yu smiled, he seemed to have come prepared.The burly chap who stood behind Zhao Yu was dressed in martial arts outfit. His eyes were cold and he carried a thick saber on his back. He shouted, \u201cI heard that Young Master is an early-stage Connate Expert at 30 years old. You are a giant among men. It\u2019s my pleasure to meet you today. Shall we exchange blows to learn from each other? I\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no interest in the name of the dead.\u201dThe person had yet to finish his sentence and he was cut off by Su Hong.Go!Su Hong gave a soft yell and his horse charged forward, reaching the burly chap dressed in martial arts outfit in no time, thrusting his long spear at the same time.\u201cYou must be courting death!\u201dThe burly chap looked calm while he took out his thick sword, releasing his Connate aura. He jumped up, raising his arms while swinging his saber at Su Hong who was coming toward him!\u201cHe is indeed a mid-stage Connate.\u201d Liu Yu nodded.Su Zimo felt nervous upon hearing his words.The Zhao family had come prepared. They even estimated that Su Hong might rush back and therefore they asked a mid-stage Connate Expert to deal with him.Su Zimo swept his gaze over the crowd. To his surprise, neither Liu Yu nor Uncle Zheng and the rest of them were nervous.What did that mean?He was still pondering when Su Hong and the burly chap exchanged blows!\u201cClang!\u201dThe thick saber of the burly chap landed heavily on the iron spear of the flowing spring, sparks came flying.The force was so huge that the horse that Su Hong was riding was forced to a stop!\u201cHaha!\u201dSu Hong laughed. He flicked the iron spear of the flowing spring. It gave off a buzzing tremor, followed by a stunning force that bounced the thick saber away.The burly chap\u2019s countenance changed.Poof!Blood was splattered all over the floor. The burly chap was sent flying by Su Hong\u2019s spear, landing on the long street, his blood staining the ground.\u201cYou pretended that you are of a lower level, y-you are a late\u2026\u201d The burly chap had yet to finish his sentence, but blood kept surging in his mouth. It was obvious that he would not get to live past tomorrow.Everyone was shocked.Nobody expected that they had only exchanged blows for one round and a mid-stage Connate Expert would be killed by a single thrust of Su Hong\u2019s spear!The most terrifying thing was what the burly chap said moments before he died. Although he did not finish his sentence, everyone present could guess what he meant.Late-stage Connate!All these years, people in the Ping Yang Town had underestimated Su Hong\u2019s abilities.\u201cHurry, let\u2019s go!\u201dThe Connate Experts of the Zhao family, Lee family and Shen family reacted quickly by protecting their masters and fleeing from the scene. All the pugilistic experts were frightened by the aura of a single man. They fled hurriedly, having no intention to stay for another second.Su Hong sneered, making no move to chase them. He got down from the horse, nodding at Su Zimo before he said, \u201cBack to the residence!\u201d\u2026Inner hall of Su family\u2019s residence.Su Hong sat in the middle like the master of the house, as Liu Yu gave a report on what happened in Ping Yang Town these past few months. He would nod occasionally as he listened to him.Su Zimo sat at the side, with his head lowered, keeping silent.Before this, his older brother never allowed him to enter the inner hall and he never participated in such meetings.After Liu Yu was done with his report, Su Hong\u2019s gaze landed on Su Zimo. He asked in a deep voice, \u201cDid you really kill the three Postnatal Experts from Shen family?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Su Zimo hesitated slightly before he admitted it.Bang!Initially, Su Hong was seated on a chair, but then he stood up suddenly, placing his feet on the ground, letting off a loud sound. He reached Su Zimo in no time and he punched in his direction.This happened too quickly, everyone in the inner hall, let alone Su Zimo could react in time.Su Zimo was startled. He had yet to recover from his shock and he automatically stretched out his palm, landing on Su Hong\u2019s fist.Wrap, hit, and he was about to execute Bovine-tongued Saber.But right then, Su Zimo remembered the scene when he shattered the long sword of the Connate Expert at Shen family\u2019s residence.The power of Bovine-tongued Saber had just been executed and Su Zimo stopped in mid-tracks.Bang!There was a loud sound as the palm and fist clashed with each other. The chair that Su Zimo was sitting on broke into pieces.Su Zimo lost his balance under the impact of the strike. He was about to sit back on the floor when he released the power of Plow Heaven Stride automatically.Su Zimo sank and it seemed as if his entire body was lying flat on the ground. However, his legs did not move a single inch and he was rooted into the ground!Su Zimo exerted strength at his waist and legs at the same time and stood up.His move was really brilliant and everyone in the inner hall could not help but be amazed.There was a sparkle in Su Hong\u2019s eyes, he kept nodding as he smiled. \u201cGood, good, you have done a good job by killing them!\u201dSu Zimo knew that his older brother was testing him just now.Right at the moment when the palm and fist collided, he could feel that his older brother had cut back on the force exerted.Of course, Su Zimo did not use all his force, he stopped in mid-tracks as well.Su Zimo knew the power of Bovine-tongued Saber. He dared not use it on his older brother.\u201cZimo, you should go back to rest. It is nothing to lose the scholarly honors. There are plenty of good ladies in the world. Don\u2019t take it to heart. Xiaoning will be back from Cang Lang City soon. If you have time, do keep her company.\u201dSu Xiaoning was Su Zimo\u2019s younger sister. She was two years younger than him. She was sent by Su Hong to study at Cang Lang City as well.Su Zimo smiled as he agreed to it, he then turned to leave.Su Hong watched as Su Zimo left. He remained silent for a long while, seeming to have mixed feelings.\u201cYoung Master?\u201d Liu Yu asked softly.Su Hong recovered himself, speaking softly, \u201cI don\u2019t think Zimo is cultivating any internal power. He used his body strength to withstand the impact from my fist just now.\u201d\u201cI have heard from others that some people are born with immense strength. Second Young Master could be such people.\u201d Liu Yu was glad.Su Hong smiled. \u201cThis is not just a matter of strength. When we sparred just now, I felt pain in my arm. It was as if it has been distorted. I suppose, he did not use his full force.\u201dYuchi Huo said, \u201cSince Second Young master is so capable, why don\u2019t we tell him about our origin and our intention?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dSu Hong shook his head. His attitude was firm. \u201cPreviously I forbade Zimo from learning martial arts as I don\u2019t want him to be embroiled in it. I don\u2019t intend to live but nothing must happen to Zimo and Xiaoning. This is final. I will hear no more about it!\u201dUncle Zheng sighed. \u201cI watched Second Young Master as he grew up. Given his intelligence, I am afraid he has already discovered something amiss.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t know as long as we keep it a secret.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were only Uncle Zheng, Liu Yu and some other people with them. Su Hong was 15 years old, while Su Zimo was only two years old and Su Xiaoning was just born.Their parents died that year.According to the Su family, they encountered a lot of beasts where they passed by Cang Lang Mountain range. Many of them died, and their parents were among those who died.Su Zimo had always been skeptical of this statement all these years.Su Zimo felt that his older brother and the rest of the Su family had been hiding many things, other than their parents\u2019 death from he and his sister.Back then when his older brother gave him the mansion, it was said that he could study hard without anyone disturbing him, but Su Zimo knew that his older brother meant to send him away.Su Zimo studied hard to get scholarly honors so that there would be a day where he could help his brother. However\u2026Su Zimo had finally sorted out his thoughts after reaching his mansion.Since his brother refused to tell him, he would not force him. His only hope was that he would become stronger so that no matter how dangerous the situation was, they could survive it.Su Zimo stepped into the cultivation field. Die Yue was lazing around on the green stone. She did not cast him a look. It was as if she did not see Su Zimo come in.\u201cI have succeeded at Bovine-tongued Saber,\u201d Su Zimo said.Die Yue acknowledged him with an indifferent attitude.Su Zimo knew that it was considered as a praise to get Die Yue\u2019s acknowledgment.\u201cGo in to cultivate.\u201d Die Yue pointed to the wooden barrel not too far away.The wooden barrel had been in the cultivation field for quite some time. It had always been empty. Su Zimo had no idea what it was used for.Today, the barrel was filled with a thick black liquid, exuding a strong smell of medicine.\u201cSo it is for my cultivation.\u201dSu Zimo jumped in without another thought.\u201cPsst!\u201dSu Zimo sucked in a cold breath as soon as he jumped into the barrel. His countenance changed.Cold!Too cold!Su Zimo felt that his hands and limbs were turning numb in no time. His hair was covered with a layer of frost. His face had turned gray and his lips purple. His body could not help but tremble uncontrollably.\u201cW-what is this?\u201d Su Zimo said in a quavering voice.Die Yue spoke lightly, \u201cYou can come out if you can\u2019t take it.\u201dSu Zimo could not stand it anymore.He even felt that if he continued to stay in the barrel, he would freeze to death.Su Zimo had just gotten up getting ready to jump out when he caught a glimpse of scoff in Die Yue\u2019s eyes. He was riled. He clenched his teeth and sat back down in the barrel.He had only taken ten breaths and he felt a chill to his bones. Under the stimulation of the medicinal liquid, Su Zimo began to lose his consciousness.Su Zimo remembered what Die Yue said to him in the past, \u201cIf you want to learn this cultivation technique, you will experience unimaginable dangers. You may lose your life at any time. Do not expect me to save you.\u201dSu Zimo knew that even if he froze to death, Die Yue would not save him.Su Zimo shut his eyes, trying to ignore the coldness that he felt. He used the breathing and expiration method of skin tempering and began to breathe slowly.All of a sudden!There were a few mysterious and lengthy sutra in Su Zimo\u2019s mind and he could hear Die Yue\u2019s voice. \u201cThere is in fact only one sutra in Body Tempering. Since you have no foundation, hence I divided it into two parts, skin tempering and flesh tempering. What you saw just now is the sutra for flesh tempering. From today onward, you will combine both of them when you cultivate.\u201d\u201cThe breathing method of flesh tempering originates from Rock Bear Demon King. The flesh of the bear is thick and sturdy. It is slow but powerful. It has the power to erect its neck, strengthen its upper limb, come out from its cave with full force, and to fight the tiger majestically. Combine the two methods of breathing and it will be the Body Tempering Sutra.\u201dDie Yue explained while she taught Su Zimo the breathing and expiration method.Su Zimo began to get the gist of it gradually and his breathing became slow and long.With each breathing and expiration, the essence of the medicinal liquid in the wooden barrel would rush into his body through the pores on his skin, supplementing the skin and nourishing the blood and flesh.This kind of cultivation method was much more direct and effective than devouring food and cultivating!Su Zimo felt that his own flesh and blood were being nourished. His skin had toughened and he seemed to have grown more muscular.If Su Zimo opened his eyes at this time, he would see an even more shocking scene.The black viscous liquid had formed a huge vortex in the wooden barrel. Su Zimo hovered in the middle of the vortex.A cow-shaped monster and a bear-shaped monster loomed next to Su Zimo. They were hazy but their eyes were bright and exuded a cold eerie light. They looked ferocious and they exuded an aura that could shake Heaven and Earth!With the passage of time, the chill in the body gradually dissipated. An inexhaustible amount of essence continued to cleanse his muscles and skin. Su Zimo\u2019s realm had been advancing rapidly.In the blink of an eye, the night had passed.Su Zimo opened his eyes and was surprised to find that the liquid in the wooden barrel had become transparent and was as clear as water.Die Yue jumped down from the green stone, saying, \u201cI will impart three more styles to you. The first style is Ground-rupturing Palm. The angle of the palm can change as you please. All you need to remember is the technique to execute the force and to understand the concept of rupturing the ground.\u201dDie Yue raised her hands slightly as she explained.Su Zimo had an idea and he shut his eyes.Su Zimo had a strange thought. It was as if he was not facing Die Yue but a hideous bear demon. It raised its gigantic bear paw and smashed it down suddenly!Although Su Zimo knew that it was only an illusion, under the powerful impact of the slam, he could not help but retreat.Swoosh!Su Zimo forgot that he was still in the barrel. He collapsed on the ground, looking like a mess. The water in the barrel was spilled all over the floor.\u201cThe second style is Mountain Reliance. You have to exert all your strength and press forward, and the opponent will die. He will have no time to react.\u201dDie Yue nudged her foot and pressed forward, her body shaking!Su Zimo\u2019s pupil constricted instantly.The air around Die Yue froze when she executed the Mountain Reliance. It seemed to turn solid then spread out thereafter!The air around them was not immune to the swiftness and impact of the pressing in movement!\u201cThe third style, Body Petrification.\u201dDie Yue paused before saying, \u201cThis is the defensive method of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. It can be considered as a mental cultivation method. After you succeed, the flesh and blood will turn into a boulder instantly. One becomes indestructible, minimizing the injuries sustained.\u201dSu Zimo began practicing Tri Rock Bear Style while Die Yue watched coldly by the side, pointing out whenever he made a mistake.Whenever Die Yue pointed out his mistakes, Su Zimo would be in agony.At the end of the day, Su Zimo had not made any progress with the Tri Rock Bear Style, but he was already covered with wounds. He had bruises all over his body and he was drenched in perspiration, lying down drained of all energy on the grass, panting heavily.Of course, Su Zimo knew very well that if not for such a harsh environment, it would take him even longer to succeed in Tri Rock Bear Style!At night, Die Yue prepared another barrel of medicinal liquid for Su Zimo\u2019s cultivation.The amazing part was that, regardless of how heavily injured Su Zimo was in the day, after cultivating in the wooden barrel for a night, he would be alive and healthy in the day and he would not have any scars on his body.In the next three months, Su Zimo slaughtered cattle and ate them, practicing Tri Rock Bear Style in the day and going into the wooden barrel at night, practicing his breathing and expiration under the stimulation of the medicinal liquid.Su Zimo gritted his teeth to endure the endless cultivation.Under such a harsh cultivation environment, Su Zimo had a deeper understanding of Body Tempering Sutra. He was able to reach initial success at his Ground-rupturing Palm and Mountain Reliance.However, he did not make much progress with Body Petrification.Su Zimo\u2019s skin, had changed from the rough texture when he first practiced Tri Bovine Style to being smooth and delicate. It was as if he had regained the natural state.His skin looked as fair as jade, but in fact it was even tougher than before!Su Zimo had become more muscular and his body was firm and sturdy. He seemed to become taller. Although he was only 17 years old, he was more than six feet tall, similar to Die Yue\u2019s height.Three months ago, when Su Zimo tried his hand at Shen family\u2019s residence, he was slashed by swords in the fight. Although he did not sustain any external injuries, the impact from the saber and sword still caused damage to his muscles and he was in pain for a long time.Right now, Su Zimo surmised that if he was stabbed by Postnatal Perfected Experts, it would not cause any damage to him.After cultivating Body Tempering, and through half a year of tough practice, his body was similar to swords and sabers.Of course, these were not the only changes he underwent after cultivating Body Tempering.He had immense strength and amazing speed. There was a sharpness in his gaze. All these brought about a transformation in Su Zimo.This morning, Su Zimo walked out of the cultivation field. He changed into a green robe, tidied up and went to the Su family\u2019s residence.Su Xiaoning would be back today.Regardless of whether it was Su Zimo, Su Hong or anyone else in the Su family, everyone doted on her and could not bear for her to suffer any grievances.Su Zimo reached Su family\u2019s residence in no time.\u201cSecond Young Master is back.\u201d The people in Su family were delighted and greeted him warmly.Su Zimo smiled and nodded at them.After recuperating for three months, Uncle Zheng\u2019s injuries had healed, but he seemed much older than before.\u201cBrother is not around again?\u201d Su Zimo asked casually.Uncle Zheng smiled. \u201cHe is caught up with business recently. He had to take care of the business and won\u2019t be able to make it back today.\u201dSu Zimo and Uncle Zheng chatted in the hall while waiting for Su Xiaoning to return.Two hours had passed\u2026Four hours\u2026Noon had passed.Cang Lang City was not too far from Ping Yang Town. It would take at most two hours to reach by foot. But right now, Su Xiaoning had yet to come back.Su Zimo turned solemn, there was a cold glitter in his eyes.Uncle Zheng frowned, thinking before he shouted. \u201cLiu Yu!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201dUncle Zheng said in a deep voice, \u201cBring some men to Cang Lang City and check whether Miss Su has set off or not. Report to me if there\u2019s any news.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dSu Zimo waved his hands.He knew his sister best.Su Xiaoning had been very obedient since a young age. She would never do things that would cause her family to be worried.Since Su Xiaoning had yet to reach Ping Yang Town, there was only one explanation. She had run into mishap!Su Zimo stood up slowly, his expression cold.Uncle Zheng and Liu Yu could feel a suffocating pressure at his single movement!These two people had been through multiple fights and battles and had many experiences where they had a close brush with death. They had no fear even when they faced immortals or thousands of army.But right now, they could not help but tremble with fear when facing Su Zimo!\u201cSecond Young Master has indeed changed!\u201d Uncle Zheng and Liu Yu stared at each other, having the same thought.\u201cReport\u2014Shen Nan from the Shen family is outside the door, seeking entry.\u201d One of the Su family guard shouted.Uncle Zheng took in a deep breath. \u201cLet him in.\u201d\u201cHehe, how are all of you doing?\u201d Shortly after, Shen Nan who was clad in white strolled in smilingly.Su Zimo did not utter a word, his eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at Shen Nan.Shen Nan\u2019s heart skipped a beat.For some unknown reason, Shen Nan felt like being targeted by a ferocious tiger and a starving wolf. He might be torn into pieces in a blink of an eye!\u201cI am only here to send a message. Zhao family and Lee family wanted to invite the two young masters of Su family to a banquet,\u201d Shen Nan hurried to say, feeling somewhat guilty.Su Zimo came to Shen Nan\u2019s side, saying calmly, \u201cMy brother is not in, I will go with you.\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master, there must be something funny about the banquet. You must not go!\u201d Liu Yu hurried forward and whispered to Su Zimo\u2019s ears.Su Zimo swept his gaze at him.Liu Yu bowed his head, and said through clenched teeth, \u201cSecond Young Master, I will go with you!\u201dSu Xiaoning was missing and the Zhao family suddenly invited Su Hong and Su Zimo to a banquet. It was obvious that it was an ambush. He might not make it back alive. But he would never stand by while Second Young Master went alone to fight the enemy.\u201cLiu Yu, Young Master Zhao has said that he only invited the two young masters from Su family, no one is to go with him, otherwise\u2026\u201d Shen Nan did not finish his sentence, but it was obvious that he was threatening them.\u201cLead the way,\u201d Su Zimo said coolly.Shen Nan gave Uncle Zheng and Liu Yu a provocative look, before he sneered and swaggered away from Su family\u2019s residence.\u201cMr Zheng, what do we do? Should I bring people to attack then. Nothing must happen to Second Young Master!\u201d Liu Yu was anxious.\u201cNo!\u201dUncle Zheng shook his head, frowning. \u201cThe other party is obviously ready. Right now, the Zhao family\u2019s residence is full of danger. Given our current strength, we will not be able to compete with them.\u201dUncle Zheng paused for a long while before he said in a deep voice, \u201cGet the nearest black armored cavalry to come as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 will they be able to arrive in time?\u201d Liu Yu asked.\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Uncle Zheng sighed. \u201cRight now, we can only hope that Second Young Master and Miss Su can hold on for as long as possible. This is the only solution.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were Postnatal Experts. They had their weapons ready, they were glittering with coldness.They looked surprised when they saw that it was Su Zimo who arrived at the courtyard. Many of them ridiculed and sneered, shaking their heads at him.The hall at the Zhao family\u2019s residence was situated at the end of the courtyard. There was an eight seater square table at the end. Many people were already seated, including Zhao Yu and Lee Yuanmao.Shen Nan arrived with Su Zimo and went to take a seat at the table.Su Zimo walked slowly into the hall, his eyes sweeping over everyone, looking calm and composed.There were a total of 17 people in the hall. Except for Zhao Yu, Lee Yuanmao and Shen Nan, everyone was a Connate Expert. Among them were Tang Mingjun, the \u201cSoul Reaping Sword\u201d who once sparred with him in Shen family\u2019s residence.Out of the 14 Connate Experts, seven of them had stronger aura than Tang Mingjun. Three of them had the strongest aura!Not surprisingly, four out of the seven people were mid-stage Connate Experts, while the other three were late-stage Connate Experts!Su Zimo had a grasp of the situation now.The Zhao family was obviously taking drastic measures to deal with a situation. They wanted to get rid of he and his brother today. Unfortunately, Su Hong was not around.\u201cWe wanted to catch a big fish, but we did not expect to catch a small shrimp instead. If we had known, there is no need to gather such a crowd over here.\u201d Zhao Yu sneered, looking at Su Zimo with disdain.\u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201d Su Zimo sounded calm and composed.Zhao Yu clapped his hands.Two women walked out side by side from the back of the hall. To be exact, one of which was being held hostage.Su Xiaoning wore a green dress, looking quick-witted. She was 15 years old, and she was already beautiful and had a flawless complexion.However, at this time, Su Xiaoning had tears in her eyes and she was trying to contain her tears. She pursed her lips as she stared at Su Zimo, refusing to say a word.Su Zimo\u2019s heart ached at the sight of her.All these years, this was the first time that he had seen his sister in such a predicament. She must have suffered a lot of grievances.Lee Yuanmao smiled. \u201cThe person next to her is my younger sister, Lee Xiangtong. It seems like she gets along very well with Miss Su.\u201dThe lady next to Su Xiaoning smiled, pulling Su Xiaoning to take a seat. She waved a sharp dagger in her hands while she spoke softly, \u201cSister, don\u2019t cry. I\u2019ll do manicure for you.\u201dWhile Lee Xiangtong was talking, she pulled Su Xiaoning\u2019s trembling fingers and glided the dagger gently across the fingertips.\u201cYah!\u201dLee Xiangtong gasped softly as drops of blood oozed from Su Xiaoning\u2019s fingertips. It was glaringly red.\u201cSister, you must not tremble. Fortunately I was being careful, otherwise your fingers would be cut off.\u201d Lee Xiangtong had a malicious smile on her face.Su Zimo did not move a single inch.Lee Xiangtong was no weak lady. She was a Postnatal Expert.Su Zimo and Lee Xiangtong were separated by an eight seater square table. They were four mid-stage Connate Experts, three late-stage Connate Experts seated at the table. There were also seven early-stage Connate Experts who stood by both sides of Su Zimo.Su Zimo had no way to save her.\u201cWell, well, well\u2026\u201dRight then, an elder in his fifties, seated at the eight seater square table clapped his hands slowly, as he nodded and said, \u201cFaced with calamities, he is still able to remain calm and unperturbed. He is a talent. Yu-er, this is no small shrimp. Given his temperament, he is worthy of this banquet.\u201dZhao Yu curled his lips.\u201cI am Zhao Chengping, the master of Zhao family.\u201dThe elder in his fifties pointed to the left and said, \u201cThis is the Lee family\u2019s master Lee Xing, as for this\u2026\u201dZhao Chengping looked to the right, saying in a deep voice, \u201cThis is Zeng Yao, Swordsman Zeng from Cang Lang City. People hailed him as \u2018Thunderbolt Saber\u2019. The person who died under Su Hong\u2019s spear three months ago was Swordsman Zeng\u2019s junior martial brother.\u201dThese three were late-stage Connate Experts!Su Zimo remained composed as he spoke slowly, \u201cThe family should not be implicated in the pugilistic affairs. Will the few of you let her go and I will stay behind to accompany you?\u201d\u201cHehe, you are not considered as part of the pugilistic society. You are merely an inferior commoner!\u201d Lee Yuanmao smiled and made a dig at him.Zhao Yu spoke in a peculiar tone, \u201cIt is alright if it is your brother, Su Hong, but you are not qualified.\u201d\u201cBrother, run\u2026\u201dSu Xiaoning had barely said a few words and her mouth was covered by Lee Xiangtong. She could only utter a few sounds, her tears rolling uncontrollably down her cheeks.Zhao Chengping sighed. \u201cI am an elder, and I don\u2019t want to lower myself to your level and deal with a junior like you. However, the Su family has been too arrogant.\u201dSu Zimo spoke with mockery, \u201cOne should fight openly for any disputes between the family clans, the Su family would not shy from it. Aren\u2019t you worried that you will be a laughingstock by doing these insidious things?\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dLee Xing, the master of the Lee family laughed and shook his head. \u201cYoung lad, you are still very inexperienced. You have not encountered any sinister events in the pugilistic society. This is nothing compared to it.\u201d\u201cIs Lee Xiangtong your daughter?\u201dSu Zimo raised his eyebrows slightly, asking a seemingly insignificant question.\u201cSo what if she is?\u201d Lee Xing snorted.\u201cThen prepare to die!\u201dA loud snarl that sounded like thunder resonated in the hall.In the meantime, Su Zimo strode forward, releasing the impact of plowing the heavens. The eight seater square table was overturned in no time, smashing to pieces.It was too fast!No one would have thought that under such circumstances, Su Zimo would make the first move even when he was unable to save himself.Everyone except Zhao Yu and two other were Connate Experts. They reacted quickly and grabbed their weapons, advancing toward Su Zimo, shouting in anger, \u201cWhat an audacious junior!\u201dAll at once, there were glint and flash of cold steel everywhere in the hall. It was cold and terrifying, no one could pass through.Zeng Yao, \u201cThunderbolt Saber\u201d had a backhand grip on his saber. There was a flash of glaring light and he directed his attack toward the area under Su Zimo\u2019s rib.Su Zimo was oblivious to the surrounding swords and sabers. He fixed his gaze on Lee Xing as he slapped with his palm, releasing a ferocious and formidable aura!Ground-rupturing Palm!Lee Xing\u2019s countenance changed at Su Zimo\u2019s violent and domineering aura. His first thought was to turn and flee.His years of experience in the pugilistic society told him that if he did not flee, he would definitely die!Lee Xing widened his eyes in anger, giving out a loud shout. He was not in time to draw his weapon, he could only use his arms to block the attack.On the other side, Zhao Chengping held the sword with one hand, a wicked light shone in his eyes. The sword quivered slightly as it dabbed toward Su Zimo\u2019s eyes.Zhao Chengping had long heard that Su Zimo practiced corporal mortification martial arts. But no matter what type of corporal mortification martial arts one practiced, one\u2019s eyes were still vulnerable.Snap!There was a loud bone-cracking sound. Lee Xing shrieked in pain. Su Zimo slapped his palms against Lee Xing\u2019s arms, breaking his bones. The broken bones protruded from the flesh, being exposed. It was a gruesome sight.A late-stage Connate Expert could not survive one single stroke of Su Zimo\u2019s!Everyone was aghast!After executing Ground-rupturing Palm, Su Zimo charged forward, capturing Lee Xing by the throat.At the same time, Su Zimo took a big step toward the left, he faced Zhao Chengping sideways, putting his cheek at the mercy of his long sword, while his left hand seemed as soft as the cow tongue, wrapping around his hand!Zhao Chengping stabbed his sword at Su Zimo\u2019s cheek. However, it did not pierce through his skin, instead it bent into an arc at the strong force.\u201cPsst! His corporal mortification martial arts is so powerful?\u201dZhao Chengping was shocked, he knew that things were not going well, and he made a move to retreat.Right then, Su Zimo\u2019s palm rested on Zhao Chengping\u2019s arm that had yet to retract.Wrap, hit, pull!Poof!Nothing could be seen except bits and pieces of flying flesh and spurting blood. The tendons and bones of Zhao Chengping had been shattered to pieces by Su Zimo\u2019s palm. The arm was being abruptly pulled out from the shoulder!Zhao Chengping fell to the ground, staring in shock at the blood spewing from the broken arm, howling in pain.Bang! Bang! Bang!At the same time, all the swords and sabers that were swinging at Su Zimo bounced back.Although Su Zimo\u2019s clothes had been chopped to pieces, there was no blood on his body.Impenetrable?All the Connate Experts could not get past Su Zimo\u2019s defense even with their weapons!Poof!Right then, there was an abrupt sound of weapons cutting into flesh.A saber stabbed inches into the area under Su Zimo\u2019s rib. Blood oozed out and stained the clothes.Regardless of whether it was Su Zimo or Zeng Yao who grabbed the saber, both were stunned momentarily.Su Zimo did not expect that someone could break through his defense.Zeng Yao thought that he would kill Su Zimo with one stab. Instead the saber was stuck and he could not move at all.Zeng Yao was hailed as \u201cThunderbolt Saber\u201d in the pugilistic society not because he has good with his saber. Instead it was his saber that was famous. It was extremely sharp. It could cut a strand of hair and split metal as if it were made of soil.To his surprise, the Thunderbolt Saber did not stab through Su Zimo\u2019s flesh. Instead it seemed to hit upon a boulder and was faced with a lot of resistance. In the end, the saber was stuck in between flesh!This was the power of Body Tempering.Zeng Yao retracted the Thunderbolt Saber and retreated a few steps. He did not continue to advance.Zeng Yao was wary of Su Zimo after seeing how he crushed Zhao Chengping\u2019s arm.Moreover, although the stab did not result in serious injuries, Su Zimo was wounded. He believed Su Zimo would be drained of energy eventually and he would not be able to walk out of Zhao family\u2019s residence alive!\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dLee Xiangtong and Su Zimo shouted at the same time.Since Su Zimo made the first move, it had only been a short while since all the Postnatal Experts in the courtyard rushed to join in the fight. By the time Lee Xiangtong realized what was happening, her father had already been captured by Su Zimo.Lee Xiangtong grabbed the dagger and placed it against Su Xiaoning\u2019s fair neck, giving a faint shout. \u201cLet my father go!\u201dSu Zimo squeezed Lee Xing\u2019s throat. Lee Xing could not resist as the bones in his arms had been shattered. His face turned a reddish purple, and he made gasping sounds.\u201cLet my sister go and I will let him off,\u201d Su Zimo said lightly.Su Zimo had made up his mind from the moment he ascertained Lee Xing\u2019s identity.It was impossible to save Su Xiaoning right away. If anything went wrong, Su Xiaoning might die. Su Zimo dared not take the gamble.But it was relatively easy to catch everyone by surprise and capture Lee Xing.\u201cSu Zimo, don\u2019t force me. If my hands shake slightly, your sister will have a wound on her face!\u201d Lee Xiangtong dangled her dagger in front of Su Xiaoning\u2019s eyes.Su Zimo smiled, revealing a row of fine white teeth.\u201cIf you dare to touch her, I will annihilate the Lee family.\u201dSu Zimo sounded very calm. It did not seem like a threat. Instead, he seemed to be telling a fact. He sounded domineering like it was unquestionable!Lee Xiangtong\u2019s heart jumped a beat.She felt unsettled at Su Zimo\u2019s tone and expression.She had no doubts of Su Zimo\u2019s capability.Given what happened so far, once Su Zimo escaped from this place, the Zhao family and the Lee family would never have peace!He was much more terrifying and vicious than Su Hong.\u201cWho exactly is the person that we have provoked? Why did we provoke him?\u201d Lee Xiangtong was full of regrets.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Anyone could tell that Lee Xiangtong was in a state of confusion and did not know what to do.Lee Xiangtong looked toward her brother, Lee Yuanmao automatically, wanting to seek help from him.Lee Yuanmao was about to say something when there was a drastic change in his expression. There was terror and fear in his eyes.Lee Xiangtong\u2019s heart plummeted at the sight of Lee Yuanmao\u2019s odd expression. She exerted force in her dagger, wanting to slice Su Xiaoning\u2019s throat.\u201cYou have no chance anymore.\u201dThis was the last sentence that Lee Xiangtong heard.Lee Xiangtong felt that someone had a death grip on her wrist. It was close to being squashed to pieces. She had no idea since when Su Zimo had reached her side.That was a pair of cold and murderous eyes, causing palpitations to whoever who saw it!Bang!Lee Xiangtong was sent flying into the air by Su Zimo\u2019s kick. She was already dead when she was mid-air.The turn of events was so fast that no one had time to react.When Lee Xiangtong glanced sideways at her brother, Su Zimo had already exerted force in his fingers, squashing Lee Xing\u2019s throat, and executed Plow Heaven Stride to come next to Lee Xiangtong, saving Su Xiaoning from her.Lee Yuanmao was scared stiff.This was supposed to be an ambush on the two brothers of the Su family. They were very sure of success. But in the blink of an eye, among the three late-stage Connate Experts, one died and one was injured, Zeng Yao was the only one left.Su Xiaoning trembled slightly. She sobbed as she stared at Su Zimo. There was fear, panic and a distant look in her eyes.Su Zimo\u2019s eyes turned soft, a smile on his face. He tore a piece of cloth from his clothes and covered Su Xiaonings eyes gently.He turned the cloth for a few rounds before he tied them together.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I will bring you home.\u201dSu Zimo spoke softly in his sister\u2019s ears.Zeng Yao witnessed the scene. He was not in a hurry to attack, instead he felt more assured.If Su Zimo chose to fight his way out, Zeng Yao believed that no one would be able to stop him including the hundreds of Postnatal Experts at the courtyard.After which, Zeng Yao would return to Cang Lang City as soon as possible, leaving Ping Yang Town with his family, so that Su Zimo could not take revenge on him.But right now, seeing how Su Zimo highly valued Su Xiaoning, his chances of escaping here alive was smaller.To Su Zimo, Su Xiaoning was his burden and weakness!\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t panic. He has been injured by me just now. He won\u2019t be able to hold out for long. Let\u2019s all target the lady!\u201d Zeng Yao sneered.Everyone present had years of experience in the pugilistic society. They knew right away what Zeng Yao meant by saying that.In fact, the injury at the area under Su Zimo\u2019s rib was not as serious as what other people imagined.If Su Zimo looked at the wound, he would be shocked to discover that the muscles around the wound had hardened and he had stopped bleeding.Body Petrification would not only strengthen Su Zimo\u2019s defense, it was also effective to stop bleeding and conserving one\u2019s energy!\u201cAttack!\u201dZeng Yao shouted and everyone roared in return, charging forward.Su Zimo protected Su Xiaoning in his embrace, exposing his back to all the pugilistic experts.Bang! Bang! Bang!There was the smell of blood in the air, with flying arms and limbs everywhere. The sabers and swords were broken to pieces, scattered all over the ground.Mountain Reliance!He released all his power at one go, executing the powerful killing style of the Tri Rock Bear Style!Everyone who was blocking Su Zimo from behind was sent flying. Some of them were scattered into pieces instantly!There was a path streaked by blood in the chaos.Although Su Zimo cultivated The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness for half a year, and he only practiced the first section, the power and strength of his flesh had already reached an unimaginable level.Although he stood at the same spot, ordinary Postnatal and Connate Experts were unable to injure him!The reason why Zeng Yao was able to hurt Su Zimo was because of the Thunderbolt Saber in his hands.With the impact and power of Mountain Reliance, Postnatal Experts became completely useless in front of him!Su Zimo stopped for a second after knocking people away for more than ten feet.More than ten Connate Experts led by Zeng Yao followed him around. They had arrived right in front of Su Zimo. They had swords and sabers ready, there were glint and flash of cold steel everywhere, dazzling and glaring.The most important thing was that the swords and sabers were all directed at Su Xiaoning.Su Zimo only had one pair of hands, he was unable to block the advancing weapons from more than ten experts.There was a vicious glare in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes. He changed his stance, with his back facing the experts, protecting Su Xiaoning as he tried to fight his way out. He executed Ground-rupturing Palm with his left hand while his right hand executed the killing technique of Bovine-tongued Saber.Poof!No one was spared with the use of his Ground-rupturing Palm.Su Zimo\u2019s right hand might seem soft, however, as he waved his hands in the air, more than ten weapons were shattered to pieces, scattering all over the ground.Su Zimo looked domineering and imposing. He was like a man-eating beast. He was too aggressive and powerful.Pierce him!Su Zimo staggered, uttering a small sound. There was blood on his back.Although the Connate Experts were unable to hurt Su Zimo, Zeng Yao made use of the chance to make a slash on Su Zimo\u2019s back. The wound was more than one foot long, it was gruesome and hideous.Su Xiaoning\u2019s eyes might have been covered, but she could sense what was going on.\u201cBrother, you should leave. Don\u2019t bother about me.\u201d Su Xiaoning sobbed.Su Zimo clenched his teeth, a murderous gleam in his eyes as he said coldly, \u201cEveryone who stop me shall die!\u201dBang!Su Zimo executed Plow Heaven Stride. He exerted strength in his legs and there were two chasms on the ground, gravel flying everywhere.The gravel contained the force of Plow Heaven Stride as well. When the gravel hit onto the people in the crowd, it would cause a huge destruction. Many of the broken weapons were being kicked into the crowd by Su Zimo.In a blink of an eye, Su Zimo had dashed to the surrounding wall of the courtyard of Zhao family\u2019s residence.Along the way, Su Zimo sustained two more wounds on his body.One of them was in the middle of his back. It was a close shave. If it was a few inches closer, Su Zimo would have died.Su Zimo finally appreciated the power of Body Tempering Sutra, He gradually understood the benefits of soaking in the dark liquid for the past three months.If it was someone else, they would be exhausted from the loss of blood.However, Su Zimo\u2019s wounds were not as serious as it seemed. Every wound had began to harden and he did not lose a lot of blood from it.Of course, if Su Zimo was able to achieve initial success at Body Petrification, the Thunderbolt Saber that Zeng Yao had would not be able to hurt him!Su Zimo protected Su Xiaoning by standing in front of her, they leaned against the wall, facing the crowd. His green robe was torn and tattered and stained with blood. He swept his gaze over the crowd. There was a burning and murderous glitter in his eyes. He was fearless.The crowd could tell Su Zimo\u2019s intention from his position.Su Xiaoning stood with her back facing the wall. Su Zimo no longer had to worry about the enemies attacking her from the back and was able to launch an aggressive attack on the enemies.As long as Su Zimo remained standing, no one could hurt Su Xiaoning!\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to last for long. Kill him!\u201dZeng Yao gave a loud shout and launched his attack.Su Zimo squinted his eyes, fixing his gaze on Zeng Yao.Zeng Yao was the only one among the crowd who posed a threat to him. To be exact, it was his Thunderbolt Saber that was able to threaten him.Swish!The long saber broke through the crowd, it was a fearsome sight. Su Zimo was oblivious to all the other weapons. He stretched his palm and held the Thunderbolt Saber. Wrap, hit, pull!Zeng Yao\u2019s countenance changed. He yelled before the Thunderbolt Saber was grabbed away from him.If other weapons were being shrouded by the power of Bovine-tongued Saber, they would have shattered to pieces. But Thunderbolt Saber was still intact and it landed in Su Zimo\u2019s hands.Su Zimo grabbed the saber with the back hand, waving it around, blocking the advancing weapons.Clang! Clang! Clang!All the advancing weapons were cut into two pieces by Thunderbolt Saber.\u201cGood saber!\u201dSu Zimo laughed loudly. He took a big stride forward, swinging the saber at Tang Mingjun who lunged toward him.Tang Mingjun\u2019s pupil constricted, there was no way to dodge.Blades of light flashed. Tang Mingjun was cut into two pieces by Su Zimo, blood spewing everywhere.Su Zimo did not know any saber techniques, but the Body Tempering Sutra was meant to cultivate one\u2019s body.If his body was powerful and fast enough, although he did not know of any proper strokes, he would be able to cause great damage.After striking with the saber, Su Zimo returned to his spot right away, guarding Su Xiaoning.Zeng Yao lost his Thunderbolt Saber, but there were still hundreds of people advancing on Su Zimo. However, they could not pose any threat to him.The situation had changed subtly.No matter how the crowd attacked Su Zimo, they could not hurt him at all. Whenever Su Zimo had the chance, he would take the initiative to attack and kill one or two people.Su Zimo was invincible when he had no weapons. Now that he had Thunderbolt Saber with him, his power was redoubled.The people who besieged Su Zimo gradually reduced. Initially, there were a dozen Connate Experts, but right now only four of them were trying their best to hold off Su Zimo\u2019s attack.The reason why they did not retreat was because they hoped that Su Zimo would be drained of his energy eventually. After all, one would not have endless amounts of energy.Moreover, everyone had witnessed it for themselves that Su Zimo had several wounds on his body.This fight had lasted for nearly four hours. If it was someone else, given that he had several wounds on his back, and he had been engaging in intense brawls, he would have died from excessive blood loss.But Su Zimo did not seem the least exhausted.All along, Su Zimo had a ferocious gleam in his eyes. Even after engaging in the fight for four long hours, his gaze seemed to be burning and he was stronger after more fights.Not knowing how long had passed, Su Zimo held Su Xiaoning\u2019s hands after chopping yet another man. Together they advanced toward the crowd slowly, looking awe-inspiring.While Su Zimo advanced, Zeng Yao and the rest retreated step by step, fear and terror evident in their eyes.All of a sudden, the crowd realized that the predators had become the prey.Su Zimo lowered his head, looking at the long saber that was still dripping with blood, saying softly, \u201cAll of you shall not leave today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The leader was Liu Yu, the guard of the Su residence.\u201cHurry, hurry!\u201dLiu Yu urged the army constantly, his forehead perspiring and his expression full of anxiety.It had been three hours since Su Zimo left the Su residence. At the moment, even the calm and collected Uncle Zheng revealed great worries in his eyes.\u201cMmm?\u201dLiu Yu\u2019s gaze focused on a few people nearby with ghastly pale faces fleeing in panic towards his direction. They seemed to be terrified.\u201cThese few people are the guards of the Zhao family!\u201d A murderous intent rose in Liu Yu\u2019s heart immediately. He wanted to order his troops to surround them.Uncle Zheng suddenly said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother about them. Go to the Zhao residence to save people first!\u201dFrom the moment that they entered the Ping Yang Town and made their way to the Zhao residence, Uncle Zheng and the others saw about a dozen pugilistic experts. All of them were dashing out of the place desperately, looking panic-stricken.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dUncle Zheng and Liu Yu felt very uneasy.Not long after, Uncle Zheng and Liu Yu led the hundreds of cavalry to the doors of the Zhao residence. Just as they were about to break in, the doors of the Zhao residence suddenly opened.A man and a woman stepped out of it.The young girl\u2019s eyes were covered with a few layers of cloth strips that had been splattered with drops of blood. Her thin face looked ghastly pale and her delicate frame quivering. She looked so pitiful that one could not help but sympathize with her.The man\u2019s clothes were torn, tattered and badly stained with fresh, red blood. He was carrying a long blood-stained knife in his left hand and holding onto the girl with his right hand, slowly making his way out of the doors of the Zhao residence.Everyone\u2019s gaze inadvertently drifted across this pair of man and woman to the courtyard of the Zhao residence.It was a creepy scene that one would not forget for life.In the courtyard, dead bodies were scattered all over the ground. Scarlet blood was flowing quietly in between the cracks of the stones. Some people\u2019s bodies had been split into half, some of their skulls shattered into pieces and some of the heads and bodies separated with broken limbs twitching.The deathly aura was pervasive. Smell of blood filled the air!This was simply a terrifying and sinister place of eternal hell!The man was drenched in blood. Carrying a long knife, he looked like a slayer who had just emerged from hell.Nevertheless, his gaze was still bright and clear. When the afterglow of the sunset landed on the exquisite and youthful face of that man, it cast a vague and mysterious glow on it.There was pin-drop silence among the hundreds of cavalry!Seemingly suppressed by an invisible and imposing aura, even the fierce horses beneath them lowered their heads and kept quiet out of fear.To everyone, the Su Zimo at this moment was both strange and familiar.Su Xiaoning seemed to have sensed something. She could not help but tear off the strips of cloth covering her eyes and turned towards the courtyard of the Zhao residence.Su Zimo reached out his palm and blocked her sight. He said gently, \u201cDon\u2019t look. Go home and rest. Forget about today\u2019s matter.\u201d\u201cUncle Zheng, Uncle Liu, send Xiaoning back to the residence.\u201d Su Zimo sounded very calm but, somehow, everyone present felt very nervous.Uncle Zheng nodded and Liu Yu immediately went forward to help Xiaoning onto the horse. He then personally escorted her back to the Su residence.After watching Liu Yu and the group leave, Su Zimo strode off gradually. His strides were heavy, leaving a long trail of bloody footprints. It was a ghastly and horrifying sight.\u201cSecond Young Master, you\u2026 \u201dWith his back facing everyone, Su Zimo waved his hands and said, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201dThe hundreds of cavalry did not move. No one dared to question or oppose him.It was only until when Su Zimo\u2019s figure disappeared at the end of the long street that everyone heaved out a long sigh of relief.Facing this seemingly frail-looking second young master of the Su family, these warriors who had experienced gutsy massacres actually felt overwhelmed by him.\u201cMr Zheng, it seems that most of the people inside are dead. There are a dozen of Connate Experts and also the family masters of both the Zhao and the Lee family!\u201d Yu Chihuo ran out from the courtyard of the Zhao family and said in a low voice.There was a commotion.At the sight of the horrible scene in the courtyard of the Zhao family, everyone was already mentally prepared. However, no one expected a dozen Connate Experts to lose their lives in this place in just half a day!Most importantly, the family masters of both the Zhao family and Lee family were dead. In addition, hundreds of pugilistic experts had been killed. It meant that these two big family clans had technically been eliminated from Ping Yang Town.Did second young master kill all these people?This was a doubt in everyone\u2019s heart.Yu Chihuo frowned and said, \u201cMr Zheng, from what I understand from young master and Liu Yu, second young master could barely compete with early-stage Connate Expert three months ago. Why did he become so scary after three months?\u201dMr Zheng looked perplexed. He sighed. \u201cWe have been guarding some secrets and refusing to talk about them. Our second young master\u2026 I\u2019m afraid he also has many secrets.\u201d\u2026Su Zimo returned to his own mansion. His face revealed a deep fatigue the moment that he closed the door.He did not lose a lot of blood from the few wounds on his body. However, the pain was still unbearable. Furthermore, Su Zimo had been killing continuously for three hours without a moment of rest. The muscles all over his body were already sore and swollen.Su Zimo sat down for a while to rest before entering the cultivation field.After half a year, Su Zimo realized that he had inadvertently became very reliant on the cultivation field. He had the feelings of homecoming when he was back.Die Yue remained seated on the green stone with a cold and indifferent expression. She did not even look at Su Zimo.However, no one had any idea of when the wooden barrel had been filled with a pitch dark medicinal liquid that was emitting a faint medicinal scent.Su Zimo conveniently threw the Thunderbolt Saber aside. He dragged his heavy body and climbed into the barrel. He could feel the icy cold medicinal liquid but his heart was warm.Su Zimo fell asleep unknowingly.During the past six months of cultivation, the Body Tempering breathing method had already become his habit. Even in his sleep, Su Zimo could still cultivate and absorb the essence of the medicinal liquid to harden and refine his skin and flesh.The killings this time had made Su Zimo experience the crux of Body Petrification.If Su Zimo was conscious, he would be shocked to discover that the wounds on his body were healing at a rate that was visible to the naked eye.The reasons were twofold. First, his body had a strong regeneration ability after cultivating the Body Tempering sutra. Second, it was due to the boundless essence that originated from the medicinal liquid.The first absorption was much faster than usual!Su Zimo woke up only after three hours of sleep. All of his previous fatigue had been swept away and he was full of vigor and energy.Su Zimo felt something was different. He touched the wounds incurred today but did not feel any scars. There was only skin that was as smooth and fine as jade!\u201cSuch powerful healing ability!\u201d Su Zimo was secretly astonished.Simultaneously, an idea flashed across Su Zimo\u2019s mind. He mentally cultivated the Body Petrification quietly.Su Zimo could clearly feel the tightening of his muscles instantly. Every inch of his flesh was squeezed together without any gap. They were as hard and firm as a rock.\u201cThis is also considered a blessing in disguise.\u201dSu Zimo secretly thought and said. \u201cWithout the trigger of these external injuries, it is most likely very difficult to understand the profound meaning of Body Petrification in such a short time.\u201dSu Zimo got up and said to Die Yue, \u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201dDie Yue did not seem to have heard him. She seemed to be resting with her eyes closed.Su Zimo walked out of the cultivation field, returned to his mansion and changed into a green robe. He headed to the Su residence directly.Su Zimo had pent-up frustrations in his heart regarding today\u2019s matter. However, it was not targeted at the Zhao family and Lee family. Instead, it was targeted at the Su family and his older brother Su Hong.At this moment, the night was pitch dark and the streets were isolated. Su Zimo used the Plow Heaven Stride and dashed ahead crazily. Soon after, he arrived at the Su residence.The doors of the Su family were not tightly shut. Instead, it was wide open.Su Zimo pondered for a while before heading to Uncle Zheng\u2019s living quarters.The courtyard was not big. There was a round stone table in the middle of it. Uncle Zheng was just sitting there. He seemed to have waited for a long time.\u201cSecond young master, you eventually still came.\u201d Uncle Zheng was a little emotional.Su Zimo sat beside the stone table and looked into both the eyes of Uncle Zheng. He said in a deep voice, \u201cSince you know the intent of my visit, is Uncle Zheng still going to keep it from me?\u201dUncle Zheng bitterly smiled and shook his head.\u201cSince a young age, older brother forbade us from learning martial arts. He sent me away to study and forbade us from intervening in the family business\u2026 There are too many things. Older brother had intentionally or unintentionally distanced Xiaoning and me from the Su family. Xiaoning is simple and innocent and doesn\u2019t sense it. But I have long noticed this.\u201dSu Zimo said softly, \u201cIf Xiaoning had learned martial arts since she was a child, today\u2019s matter might not have happened. I can tell that those people behind Uncle Zheng today are all Postnatal Experts who had been through countless fights and battles. Since our family clan has such strength and power, why didn\u2019t we reveal them earlier? What business is older brother into? Is he only selling horses? Why did he go to the Country of Yan and not Country of Da Qi to do business?\u201dUncle Zheng looked like he was in a difficult position. He wanted to say something but held back his tongue.The two faced each other in silence. The atmosphere was becoming increasingly stifling.Su Zimo\u2019s words were startling when he spoke suddenly, \u201cWere my parents murdered by someone?\u201dUncle Zheng\u2019s countenance suddenly changed. However, it reverted to normal in the next moment.\u201cUncle Zheng, Zimo is not the once frail and weak scholar. I believe you have also seen it yourself. What exactly is the Su family afraid of? Who is the Su family\u2019s enemy? Tell me!\u201d Su Zimo held onto Uncle Zheng\u2019s arm, his eyes shining sinisterly and coldly.Uncle Zheng gave a long sigh. \u201cSecond young master, it is not that I don\u2019t want to say it. It is just that telling you won\u2019t do you any good. Certainly, you are different from before. You have become stronger and can even kill many Connate Experts. But\u2026 \u201dAfter pausing for a while, Uncle Zheng shook his head and said, \u201cAfter all, these are still just the strength of mortals.\u201dThese words seemed familiar.Half a year ago, before she left, Shen Mengqi had told Su Zimo that even if he were to attain the Postnatal or Connate realms in the future, they are only of mortal strength and could not withstand even a blow of the immortals!Su Zimo understood what Uncle Zheng was implying.However, he did not expect that the enemy of the Su family had been the legendary immortal cultivators since a long time ago.In addition, Su Zimo himself had incidentally offended a Perfected Golden Core. All these events seemed to be part of destiny. After numerous twists and turns, they still could not get out of it.\u201cAt what realm is the enemy of the Su family at? Qi Refinement Warrior? Foundation Establishment Cultivator or Perfected Golden Core?\u201d Su Zimo asked calmly.He had long heard from Die Yue that mortals at the Qi Condensation Realm were called Qi Refinement Warrior. There were ten levels and the tenth level was the Perfected level. Those in the Foundation Establishment Realm could be called a Cultivator. Only those in the Golden Core Realm were qualified to be called \u2018Perfected\u2019.\u201cYou\u2026 \u201dObviously, Uncle Zheng was surprised that Su Zimo actually knew the terms of cultivation. His expression was full of shock.After some time, Uncle Zheng said, \u201cThe Foundation Establishment Cultivator and Perfected Golden Core are far beyond our reach. Ordinary mortals are certainly not a match for even the Qi Refinement Warrior.\u201d\u201cYou may be able to kill the Connate Experts now. However, even a Level 1 Qi Refinement Warrior can kill you.\u201dSu Zimo furrowed his brows slightly.Naturally, Su Zimo did not believe Uncle Zheng\u2019s words.According to Die Yue, demon cultivation was also a kind of cultivation of Dao. It was definitely not any lesser than the three sects of Immortal, Buddha and Fiend.He had already mastered the Body Tempering section of the The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. Could he not defeat even a Level 1 Qi Refinement Warrior?Furthermore, the two massacres during the half a year had boosted Su Zimo\u2019s confidence greatly.\u201cUncle Zheng, do you mean that you will tell me everything and no longer keep the truth from me if I am powerful enough to attack and kill the Qi Refinement Warrior?\u201d Su Zimo asked again.\u201cThis\u2026 \u201d Uncle Zheng said hesitatingly. \u201cSecond young master, you don\u2019t have the spirit root. You can only be a mortal for life. Ultimately, you won\u2019t be a match for the immortals.\u201dSu Zimo sneered. He thought of what Die Yue had said before and casually commented, \u201cWhat kind of immortals are Qi Refinement Warrior considered as? Even the Perfected Golden Core dare not be so impudent to call themselves immortal!\u201dWhen Die Yue said this, Su Zimo was stunned and speechless by her supercilious and domineering aura that belittled the heaven and earth.Now, Uncle Zheng had the same expression on his face. His jaws dropped slightly and his face was filled with shock.\u201cLet\u2019s wait for young master to be back before we talk about this again.\u201d Uncle Zheng finally spoke.\u201cOkay, I will ask older brother when he is back.\u201dSu Zimo did not stay behind. He turned and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the sight of Die Yue, he asked, \u201cMiss Die, I have already mastered Body Tempering. Although I have only attained initial success, I should have some chances of defeating the Level 1 Qi Refinement Warrior?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You will die for sure!\u201dDie Yue glanced at Su Zimo and said coldly.Su Zimo stood dazedly on the ground. He could not hide the disappointment in his eyes.He had felt quite disdainful when he heard Uncle Zheng\u2019s words earlier as he thought that he could suppress the Qi Refinement Warrior easily. He did not expect\u2026As such, doubts rose in Su Zimo\u2019s heart at this moment.Since demon cultivation was also a form of the cultivation of Dao, why was it that he could not even defeat a Level 1 Qi Refinement Warrior?Die Yue seemed to have read Su Zimo\u2019s mind. She said nonchalantly, \u201cYour current strength is enough to kill a Level 4 Qi Refinement Warrior. However, you don\u2019t have a good understanding of combat. There are too many factors that can influence combat and strength is only one of them.\u201d\u201cKill a Level 4 Qi Refinement Warrior!\u201dSu Zimo was stunned. He gradually recovered from his senses. So, it was not that he was not powerful enough but because he lacked the combat techniques.It was akin to a peerless knife that would unleash varying degrees of potency, depending on whose hands it landed in.Since that was the case, Su Zimo still felt a little indignant. He raised his voice, \u201cI know a little about fighting. When I was round up by hundreds of pugilistic experts, I can also carve out a path amidst the adversity!\u201d\u201cYou have been beaten up so miserably by a group of mortals. Yet, you think that it is something worth bragging about it?\u201dDie Yue sneered. She waved her hands lightly. Seemingly led by an invisible force, the Thunderbolt Saber that was initially pierced in the ground rose and floated in the air.\u201cJee!\u201dA few feet away, Die Yue stretched out her finger and pointed at Su Zimo\u2019s direction.Swoosh!Blades of light flashed. The Thunderbolt Saber had already appeared in front of Su Zimo\u2019s eyes. It was hanging in front of his glabella without moving an inch!It was too fast!He did not even have the time to react.Die Yue said with a lazy drawl, \u201cThis is the most common attack stroke of Qi Refinement Warrior \u2013 making use of spirit qi to control the spirit weapon. If you are fighting with the Qi Refinement Warrior, you will be dead meat by now.\u201d\u201cS-so fast? How do I dodge it?\u201d Su Zimo was a little dazed.Die Yue said, \u201cThere are two abilities in demon that are far beyond that of the cultivators. First, a strong and powerful body. Second, an acute spirit perception. You must remember. Most of the cultivators\u2019 bodies are relatively weak. As long as you can avert their first wave of attack and take the chance to shorten the distance between the both of you, you will be able to make use of the strong and powerful close combat ability of the demon clan to slay them!\u201dSu Zimo frowned and pondered deeply. After some time, he asked, \u201cI understand what is meant by strong and powerful body. The objective of Body Tempering is to train the body. But what is spirit perception?\u201dDie Yue said, \u201cIt is hard to explain spirit perception. You can take it that it meant alertness and sense of danger. The demon clan believed in jungle laws and the survival of the fittest. If you don\u2019t have a keen spirit perception, you will be eliminated and your entire family annihilated!\u201d\u201cThe cicada senses it before the autumn wind approaches?\u201d Su Zimo\u2019s eyes shone brightly.Die Yue nodded.\u201cHow do I cultivate the spirit perception?\u201d Su Zimo asked again.\u201cSimple.\u201dThe corners of Die Yue\u2019s mouth curled up slightly. With an odd smile, she suddenly waved the sleeves of her robes and swirled towards Su Zimo.Swoosh!Space became contorted and everything turned black. Su Zimo felt that he had lost all his senses.In the next moment, it seemed that he had been brought to another place.\u201cWhere am I?\u201dAfter Su Zimo regained his senses, he looked around. There was pin-drop silence in the surroundings. It was pitch black and exuding an aura of primitive wilderness. A peculiar atmosphere filled the air.Die Yue casually said, \u201cThis is the Cang Lang Mountain Range. If you can survive here for one year, you will have successfully cultivated the spirit perception.\u201dSu Zimo was stunned.The Cang Lang Mountain Range was about a few tens of kilometers from Ping Yang Town. It was famous for being a dangerous terrain. Dominated by demons and beasts, there was danger at every step. There was absolutely no way that one could pass through this place at night.Previously, he had heard many legends about the Cang Lang Mountain Range. There were fiendish demons that suck in human essence and energy as well as fearsome beasts with eyes like bronze bells.Of course, the lord of Cang Lang Mountain Range were the wolves, which were the majority. Blood thirsty and brutal, they definitely bore grudges.A few decades ago, a hunter from a nearby village caught a small wolf from Cang Lang Mountain Range. Unexpectedly, that same night, the entire village had been devoured and wiped out by thousands of wolves. Even fowls and dogs were not spared. It had become a ghostly village that no one dared to live at.The surrounding states could not do anything about the Cang Lang Mountain Range. None of the armies dared to venture deep into the place.Not to mention surviving in it, it was as difficult as reaching the sky just to pass through it safely and unscathed.Die Yue continued to say, \u201cThere is a difference in realms between the demons too. Those at the lowest realm are not even qualified to be called a \u2018demon\u2019. They are termed as spirit beasts in the cultivation arena, meaning, they are beasts that can understand humans. There are weak and strong spirit beasts. That Zhui Feng of yours is considered the weakest kind of spirit beast. It\u2019s spirit intellect had just been activated. For powerful spirit beasts, their ability is comparable to a Perfected Qi Refinement Warrior!\u201d\u201cAbove the spirit beast is the spirit demon. There is an even greater gap between the weak and strong ones. The strong ones are comparable to Perfected Golden Core. The weak ones are equivalent to Foundation Establishment Cultivators.\u201dSu Zimo frowned and asked, \u201cAre there spirit demons in Cang Lang Mountain Range?\u201dAccording to Die Yue, he could not even defeat the most commonplace Qi Refinement Warrior, let alone the spirit demons whose abilities were equivalent to the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core Realms.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Die Yue smiled imperceptibly.Su Zimo was stunned.What kind of answer was that?Su Zimo believed that it was impossible that Die Yue did not know. The only possibility was that Die Yue did not wish to tell him.Die Yue said calmly, \u201cThis is a test. If you can survive, you will completely transform and unleash the true powers of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. If you can\u2019t endure it\u2026 You will no doubt be shared and devoured by the spirit demons. Everything will end then.\u201dSu Zimo realized that if he were to survive in the Cang Lang Mountain Range for one year, he would definitely face various kinds of spirit beasts. Danger would be lurking in every corner. This was a cruel test.Of course, it was also a form of training.A life and death experience!In the moments of struggle between life and death, one could mould a strong and powerful spirit perception!Die Yue said, \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to regret now. If you decide to stay here, I won\u2019t take care of you. If I don\u2019t see you in Ping Yang Town one year later, I will leave on my own.\u201d\u201cRegret?\u201dSu Zimo smiled. Be it Zhou Dingyun who could come back to look for him at any point in time, the enemy of the Su family or to seek revenge for Zhui Feng, he did not have a choice.\u201cI will return alive in one year\u2019s time.\u201dIn the darkness, Su Zimo\u2019s eyes were bright and clear, and firm and resolute.He requested a brush and paper from Die Yue and wrote the words \u2018I will be away for some matters. Please don\u2019t miss me\u2019.Su Zimo folded the paper and passed it to Die Yue. He said, \u201cFind a way to send this to the Su residence. Uncle Zheng recognizes my handwriting.\u201dDie Yue nodded and said, \u201cThere are still three hours to dawn. I will impart the Tendons Transformation section to you and leave before dawn. You only have three hours to cultivate. Make full use of the time.\u201dA page of sutra verses appeared in Su Zimo\u2019s mind again.\u201cThe Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. Body Tempering is the foundation. If the flesh and skin are not hard and strong enough, when one cultivate Tendons Transformation, the body will swell and explode amidst the contraction, expansion and pulsation of the large tendons. The cultivator will become paralyzed.\u201d\u201cThe Tendons Transformation method originates from the Anaconda Demon King and the Sanguine Ape Demon King. Cultivate the anaconda section, followed by the ape section. Anaconda is the most agile one. It has the ability to cut swathes, twist and coil as well as bend and stretch. Apes are adept at climbing the mountains and ascending the rocks.\u201d\u201cUpon the initial success of Tendons Transformation, the body\u2019s resilience will increase tremendously. It will be as agile as the python and as light as the ape. It will rise like the wind and fall like an arrow. Your strength will also increase. The pulsating sound of the large tendons will be similar to that of the vibration of bowstrings. Upon phenomenal success, the three body parts \u2013 skin, flesh and tendons \u2013 will be in perfect harmony. One will be able to expand and contract the muscles and change his figure or appearance. No one will be able to see through him unless the Perfected Nascent Soul make use of his detection methods to do so.\u201dDie Yue spoke about the profound meaning of Tendons Transformation tirelessly.In the deep forest, it was dark and silent. Even the cicadas were not making any sound. It was only resonating with the pleasant and lazy-sounding voice of a lady.The green-robed scholar beside the lady was focused and listening attentively.Time passed and the dark sky gradually faded.When the first ray of sunlight broke through the mist and landed in the forest, Die Yue stopped and turned to Su Zimo. She said softly, \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dIn Su Zimo\u2019s memory, he had never seen Die Yue speaking to him with such a tone.For some unknown reason, there was a strange feeling in Su Zimo\u2019s heart.As if he had been possessed, Su Zimo asked, \u201cIf I encounter any danger, will you really leave me in the lurch?\u201dSu Zimo regretted as soon as he finished his words.True enough, Die Yue sneered. \u201cWhat has your life and death got to do with me?\u201dThese words seemed very cold-blooded and inhuman.After inviting a snub, Su Zimo looked embarrassed. He was silent.Die Yue turned and left. In the blink of an eye, she disappeared into the dense forest.Su Zimo\u2019s lonely figure remained rooted to the ground Just as Su Zimo was feeling a little disappointed, Die Yue\u2019s voice rang again. It became increasingly distant and gradually faded off.\u201cCang Lang Mountain Range is the world of \u2018demons\u2019, especially at night. If you can tide over the first month, you will have 30 percent chances of leaving it alive in one year\u2019s time.\u201dSu Zimo was stunned.No matter what, Die Yue was not completely unconcerned about him. Otherwise, there was no need for her to impart the Tendons Transformation to him last night.\u201cThere is only a 30 percent chance of survival after enduring the first month?\u201dSu Zimo was secretly shocked. He assessed the surroundings with vigilance. After confirming the absence of danger, he tied the Thunderbolt Saber on his back and sat cross-legged to recall the contents of the Tendons Transformation sutra.If he wished to survive in the Cang Lang Mountain Range, he would have to master the Tendons Transformation as soon as possible.According to Die Yue, his ability would be of a threat to the Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior upon attaining the initial success of Tendons Transformation.This also meant that he could slay most of the spirit beasts in the Cang Lang Mountain Range. His chance of survival would increase tremendously.Su Zimo constantly used the breathing and expiration method and diligently tried to comprehend the Tendons Transformation.It could be due to the foundation of the Body Tempering or the pressure of being in danger; not long after, Su Zimo managed to master the initial stage of the Tendons Transformation breathing method.He did not need Die Yue\u2019s reminder this time. Su Zimo combined the sutras of both Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation and cultivated them simultaneously.With each breathing and expiration, Su Zimo was hardening and refining not only his flesh and blood but also his large tendons. He had become more flexible and powerful.Su Zimo was immersed in the cultivation and had forgotten his whereabouts.After an unknown period of time, Su Zimo suddenly felt a liquid-like substance dropping onto his face. It felt a little warm and sticky.\u201cIs it raining?\u201dJust as this thought arose, Su Zimo opened both his eyes immediately. His countenance changed greatly.Wrong!How could rain drops feel warm and sticky?Su Zimo was instantly jolted awake. He finally realized that he was in the danger-filled Cang Lang Mountain Range and not the original cultivation field!There was danger!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Fiendish AppearancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosUnprecedented feelings of fear arose and Su Zimo felt his scalp blistering. He had goosebumps all over his body.Su Zimo\u2019s reflexes kicked in and both his lower limbs moved to flee before he even stood up completely.Swoosh!A malicious and stinking breeze attacked in his direction and Su Zimo dodged it just in time. He could not help but look back.Su Zimo\u2019s pupils contracted violently. Instantly, his heart was in his throat.This was an anaconda that was beyond Su Zimo\u2019s recognition. It\u2019s humongous body was as thick as a water barrel. Covered tightly with scales, it\u2019s body shone with a cold and metallic lustre. It was glaring at Su Zimo with greenish, squinted eyes and big predacious mouth; saliva was continuously dripping from in between it\u2019s teeth.He was too careless. Su Zimo still had some lingering fear.He had been approached by such a large species and he actually did not sense it at all!The anaconda curled itself around an old tree that was as tall as the clouds and looked down at Su Zimo from the great heights. There was a flash of contempt in his eyes.This was a spirit beast!This kind of human-like glances appeared in an anaconda. It was evident that it was psychic and as intelligent as humans. It was just that it could not speak human language.Although there was a huge gap in size between the python and human, Su Zimo did not look the slightest bit afraid after he calmed down. On the contrary, he was very eager to try.This was a rare opportunity.The python\u2019s gaze was cold and sinister. It attacked first. The humongous body dropped onto the ground and twisted a few times in the grass. All was quiet. In the blink of an eye, it had slithered to Su Zimo with intelligent movements and lighting speed.\u201cOh no!\u201dSu Zimo had a great shock.The anaconda slithered over, erratically moving it\u2019s head. In that instance, he suddenly found it difficult to grasp the chance and had to abolish all of his original plans.If he were to fail in his first strike, he would undoubtedly die!In between flashes of light and stones on fire, Su Zimo exerted strength on both his lower limbs. His body backed off rapidly and averted the attacks.At this moment, a surge of evil aura that was as resilient as a knife swept over. Before he could react, his body had been hit firmly at the sweep of the python\u2019s tail and was thrown off.Bang! Bang! Bang!After crashing into and breaking three old trees consecutively, Su Zimo fell onto the ground and vomited a mouthful of blood. His face was as white as a sheet.This collision had injured him greatly.At this moment, Su Zimo felt that the tendons and bones in his body were about to shatter. The pain was unbearable and he simply did not have anymore energy to fight.\u201cA difference of one stroke actually landed me in such a miserable state.\u201dBefore he could finish this thought, he sighted the anaconda chasing closely and pouncing on him again. A black shadow engulfed him. Su Zimo gritted his teeth, twisted his arm, pulled out the Thunderbolt Saber on his back and slashed forward with all his might!There were flashes of blood.The anaconda gave a sorrowful cry. A bloody wound appeared on its head. One of the eyes was already blinded!Having suffered such a grievous injury, the humongous body of the anaconda tossed and twisted continuously, causing the surrounding trees to break one by one. The sound and atmosphere was appalling.Su Zimo knew that he was definitely not a match for this anaconda despite the latter\u2019s injury. Their abilities were not on the same level.Furthermore, he was more seriously injured. If he were to receive another crazy whip by the anaconda, he would definitely die on the spot.Su Zimo dared not stay any longer. He fled quickly using the Plow Heaven Stride.Before he could run far, he felt drained of energy. His chest felt stifled; he could not help but spit out another mouthful of fresh blood.In the battle at the Zhao family, he was covered in blood but they were caused by external injuries. The Connate Experts\u2019 strength was not powerful enough to penetrate his skin and flesh.However, the tail of this anaconda not only mangled his chest but also injured his internal organs.If Su Zimo had not used the Body Petrification, that strike was enough to blast his body!\u201cAm I going to be buried in this place on the very first day?\u201dSu Zimo bit the tip of his tongue and tried hard to stay sober. He quietly pondered and said, \u201cI must find a good place to hide as soon as possible. Otherwise, any spirit beast that I encounter can kill me easily.\u201dAfter running for a while, he sighted a steep mountain wall in front of him. There was a cave on it a few feet from the ground.Su Zimo\u2019s eyes lit up.He arrived at the mountain wall and used the Thunderbolt Saber to dent the walls as he climbed up.Stepping on these dents, Su Zimo climbed up the mountain wall and carefully peeped into the cave. He flipped inside after ascertaining that there was no danger.This \u2018torture\u2019 had already exhausted his last bit of strength.The cave was not big and could barely fit three people. Fortunately, the location was not bad and could avoid most of the terrestrial beasts.Su Zimo lay in the cave and tried to perk himself up. He used the breathing and expiration method continuously and the healing power of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness to recover from his injuries.Time passed quickly and the sun was gradually setting.When Su Zimo was following Die Yue on the first night, he did not feel the horror of the Cang Lang Mountain Range. Last night, there was complete silence. It was as if all the living things had gone into hiding.Today, the night had just arrived and spirit beasts were already beginning to appear. Sounds of roars shook the wilderness. From time to time, giant birds would fly pass the mountain wall, casting their shadows and blocking the moon.In the forest, the spirit beasts prowled fearlessly, the old trees swayed and an eerie atmosphere filled the air. There were constant sounds of terrifying roars.This was the true colors of Cang Lang Mountain Range!If Die Yue was not accompanying him last night, he could not even tide over it!Earlier on, Su Zimo saw for himself a spider with a human face as big as a basin. It moved at lighting speed as it climbed towards this wall mountain.To his surprise, a black figure suddenly appeared on the wall mountain rolled into the spider\u2019s body and disappeared in between the cracks of the rocks.When Su Zimo was fear-stricken, he heard a ferocious roar from the sky. Immediately after, a divine eagle with a pair of purple wings appeared out of nowhere. It\u2019s super sharp claws were shining coldly like daggers. It dug into the cracks of the rocks on the wall mountain and crushed a big piece of rock.\u201cRoar!\u201dA miserable cry could be heard from the crack of the rocks. The purple-winged eagle had already captured a crawling spirit beast. It\u2019s claws pierced deeply into the body of the spirit beast and fresh blood splattered out.This spirit beast was huge. It was a hundredfold bigger than the purple-winged eagle. However, it could not escape no matter how it struggled. The purple-winged eagle carried it and soared into the sky.Before it left, the purple-winged eagle had obviously discovered Su Zimo. It even glanced back at the cave on the wall mountain with a chilling glare.It could be that Su Zimo seemed too frail and weak in comparison to that spirit beast. Hence, the purple-winged eagle did not bother. It spread its wings and flew away.That one gaze was enough to land him in trepidation and send chills up his spine.This was a spirit demon!This purple-winged eagle was definitely a spirit demon!\u201cIt is too powerful. Just the aura that it exuded could make me feel defenseless. I don\u2019t know if it is a spirit demon at the Foundation Establishment Realm or Golden Core Realm.\u201dSu Zimo swallowed the lump in his throat. He shifted himself deeper into the cave.In the forest under the wall mountain, there were killings everywhere. The air was moist and filled with a bloody stench. The earlier scene was just the tip of the iceberg.This was the Cang Lang Mountain Range. Bloody, brutal and filled with the most primitive slaughters!After surviving the second night with much difficulty, Su Zimo discovered that there was another test awaiting him.One night had passed but his injuries had not completely recovered. Hence, he dared not continue to cultivate.In Ping Yang Town, he did not need to worry about food. However, food had become his greatest problem in Cang Lang Mountain Range.Su Zimo was injured and dared not act rashly.However, without food, each time he breathed in and out, he was using the essence of his own blood and flesh to cultivate. His hunger would increase and he would not be able to endure for too long.It was a vicious cycle.Without food, there was no energy source and he would not be able to cultivate. It would be difficult to heal the injuries on his body and advance to another realm. It was even harder to obtain food.Henceforth, every step that he took would determine his destiny!Su Zimo moved his body and used the Thunderbolt Saber to dig and deepen the cave. He placed some leaves and branches near the entrance of the cave to camouflage it and hide himself.One day\u2026Two days\u2026Despite the torture of starvation and pain arising from his injuries, Su Zimo waited patiently and did not leave the cave.On the third day, he finally received an opportunity to turn the tides.Last night, there were many killings below the mountain wall. One of the spirit beasts died and a lot of flesh and blood were left on it\u2019s dead body.Su Zimo stared at the remains of the spirit demon for a long time. After much consideration, he finally made up his mind and walked out of the cave, carrying the Thunderbolt Saber.Worried that he would attract other spirit beasts, Su Zimo dared not start a fire. He bore with the disgust and devoured the flesh and blood mouthful by mouthful. His eyes surveyed the surroundings continuously and he was high-strung.He dared not bring this spirit beast back to the cave, for fear that the bloody stench would expose the location of his cave.Only three days had passed and his scholarly aura and inexperience subsided. He was strangely calm, as if he belonged to the most primitive human clan. He cautiously struggled to survive in the bleak and remote land, devouring raw flesh and drinking blood.After cultivating The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, Su Zimo\u2019s appetite had increased greatly. Soon after, he finished off the flesh and blood on this spirit beast.After returning to the cave, he began to cultivate.He discovered the difference when he cultivated.The energy essence contained in the flesh and blood of the spirit beast was richer than that of ordinary cattle and sheep. Taking in this raw flesh and blood allowed the essence to be absorbed into his belly directly without any wastage.Prior to this, after Su Zimo consumed one cattle, he would cultivate and drain all the energy from the flesh and blood in just half a day.On this occasion, he cultivated for one entire day and night.Of course, the benefit was evident. The injuries caused by the anaconda had completely healed. In addition, the Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation Realms had advanced substantially.In the time to come, Su Zimo did not venture too far away.He spent most of his time cultivating the Tendons Transformation in the cave. Occasionally, he would secretly observe the killing techniques of the spirit beast below the mountain wall to comprehend them.After he felt that he had learned something, Su Zimo left the cave to hunt and kill spirit beasts to nurture his spirit perception and polish his martial skills.Although he suffered more losses than victories, was unkempt and covered in wounds at times, Su Zimo could always escape alive with Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation as the foundation.In between life and death struggles, he constantly concluded, comprehended and cultivated.Three months later, Su Zimo returned to the old place and looked for that anaconda. He then slayed it with his bare hands.Henceforth, Su Zimo completely left the cave that he had been living in. He wandered in countless mountains and ravines, traveled in dense forests and big pools and engaged in combat with various kinds of birds and spirit beasts.This was a bloodshed world about the survival of the fittest. The so-called most powerful one did not exist.In one moment, one was proud and majestic. In the next moment, he could possibly end up as a prey in the belly of other spirit beasts.There were countless miserable and intensive bloody battles, countless narrow escapes from death, constant vigilance and constantly on tenterhooks. As time passed by, Su Zimo acquired a unique and indescribable sense of danger.That\u2026. was spirit perception!In this mountain range that no one paid attention to, a young boy from the human clan without spirit root was undergoing a thorough transformation. A fiendish appearance was taking root!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Holding on to his chin, his eyes were closed. He was frowning and deep in thought.\u201cCity Lord, did you request for my presence?\u201dShortly after, Cao Gang, one of the Five Wolf Guards, walked in, cupped his fists and bowed to him respectfully.\u201cMmm.\u201dLuo Tianwu opened his eyes. A beam of light streaked across them but only lasted for a moment. He asked, seemingly casual, \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the Su family of Ping Yang Town?\u201dCao Gang pondered and said, \u201cThe Su family\u2019s background is mysterious. Most likely, they are not from our Country of Da Qi. I suspect that they are from the Country of Yan. In addition, the Su family is not as weak as they appear to be. Young Master Su had hidden his ability for many years. He is a figure not to be underestimated. He is most probably hatching a major ploy. As for Second Young Master Su\u2026 \u201dCao Gang paused for a while. Luo Tianwu revealed a look of curiosity, he smiled imperceptibly and asked, \u201cWhat about Second Young Master Su?\u201d\u201cOne year ago, I witnessed Second Young Master Su offending the immortal.\u201dCao Gang shook his head. \u201cThis lad is an inexperienced and aggressive youngster. He is initially quite clever and has also attained scholarly honors. His honors had been written off now and he is reduced to an inferior commoner. We don\u2019t need to bother about him.\u201d\u201cQuite clever? Haha.\u201d Luo Tianwu smirked. \u201cCao Gang, your judgment is off this time.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Cao Gang was stunned for a moment.\u201cThis is the information from my subordinate\u2019s spy. Take a look.\u201d Luo Tianwu passed a few confidential papers on the table to Cao Gang.Cao Gang swept his gaze across them; his expression gradually changed.Luo Tianwu said in a low voice, \u201cSix months ago, Su Zimo almost destroyed all the pugilistic experts of the Lee family and Zhao family relying on his own strength. These two families have virtually been wiped out, although their names still exist. The Yang family avoided the disaster and took the chance to fawn on the Su family. Now, the Su family is holding the power in Ping Yang Town. This individual is not a frail scholar. He is a character who is more terrifying than Su Hong!\u201d\u201cHow can this be possible?\u201d Cao Gang was dumbstruck.Luo Tianwu said, \u201cThere are two possibilities. First, Su Zimo transformed from a frail scholar to a top-notch expert in six months\u2019 time. Second, Su Zimo concealed his abilities and lied to everyone. Regardless of the possibility, this individual is not a mediocre character.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is this Su family plotting at?\u201d Cao Gang drew his brows together.Luo Tianwu snarled, \u201cPeople from Country of Yan. 15 years ago. By the last name of Su. Combining these few pieces of information, can\u2019t you guess?\u201d\u201cLord Wuding of the Country of Yan, Su Mu!\u201d Cao Gang said, his voice trailing off.Luo Tianwu nodded and said regretfully, \u201cSu Mu is considered an outstanding hero. He led tens of thousands of armored cavalry and dominated the battlefields, sweeping up victories wherever they went. How famous and majestic was he then? Which of the surrounding states dared to launch attacks and take over the glory? Unfortunately, he was too foolish. In the end, his outcome was akin to casting the bows aside once the birds are gone and slaying the lackeys after they have outlived their usefulness.\u201dAfter pausing shortly, Luo Tianwu closed both his eyes, exuding a sharp and imposing aura. He gradually said, \u201cSince there is a lesson drawn from other\u2019s mistakes, we can\u2019t follow the footsteps of Su Mu! Although the Great Zhou King is ruling the four states, there are signs of chaos. The dukes are rising in power. It is time to invade the city, seize the territory and declare ourselves as the king!\u201d\u201cCao Gang is willing to obey the City Lord\u2026 obey the King!\u201d Cao Gang was quick to adapt to the circumstance. He changed his address immediately.Luo Tianwu nodded satisfactorily. He said, \u201cCao Gang, I also have Qi Refinement Warriors as my backers. I won\u2019t act without confidence.\u201dAt the sound of the three words \u2018Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019, Cao Gang\u2019s eyes lit up and his mood livened up.\u201cSince the Su family has such a background, we can make use of them\u2026 \u201d Luo Tianwu revealed a playful smile.\u2026In the Cang Lang Mountain Range.After six months of wandering in the wilderness, Su Zimo had made tremendous progress in the realm of Tendons Transformation. He was close to initial success. After cultivating the anaconda styles, he had begun to cultivate the ape styles.Most importantly, Su Zimo now possessed a spirit perception that was skin to that of a beast. He was extraordinarily sharp and sensitive.Relying on the spirit perception, Su Zimo had countless narrow escapes from deaths. He even got away from some spirit demons before.However, in the recent one month, Su Zimo encountered some trouble.The lord of Cang Lang Mountain Range, the wolf clan, that had an astronomical number of members.Su Zimo encountered a wolf preciously. After a bloody battle, he killed it but unexpectedly provoked the endless hunting by the wolves.If he were to fight them on one-on-one, most of the wolves were not Su Zimo\u2019s match.However, the most terrifying thing about the wolf clan was their patience and acute sense of smell.Su Zimo had escaped from the packs of wolves countless times. But not long after, the wolves would hunt him down again with their keen sense of smell.This manhunt continued for one month.If Su Zimo\u2019s body was not strong enough or did not have the foundation of the two classic demon sections, Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation, he would have most probably died of exhaustion.In the long and endless escape, Su Zimo\u2019s clothes had long been torn by the spirit beasts during the combats. He was dressed in the random pieces of beast skins and had a grey stubble on his face. He did not look any different from a wild man.In the recent few days, the wolf clan seemed to have sensed that Su Zimo\u2019s physique had reached its limit. They hunted him even more closely and harassed him repeatedly!Su Zimo had a few terrifying wounds on his body. Although the bleeding had stopped, they had not healed completely.The wolf packs did not give Su Zimo any time to recover from his injuries at all.Su Zimo clearly knew that his condition would only worsen if this were to continue but he could not think of any solution to get away from the hunt of the wolf clan.This night, Su Zimo arrived at a valley. Mid-way at the valley, he stopped in his tracks suddenly. His expression was grave.The cold breeze in his face carried traces of murderous aura!Behind him, pairs of greenish and sinister eyes of wolves appeared. Ferocious gazes were apparent. Wolves walked out from the darkness, filled the entire place and rounded up Su Zimo who was in the center.On the two sides of the valley, there were also many wolves. They were howling at the moon.\u201cYou are finally here.\u201dSu Zimo licked his dry and chapped lips. His eyes were filled with a murderous intent.One month of sleepless and restless nights had reduced Su Zimo\u2019s spirit perception to its worst state. As a result, he had fallen into the situation of being rounded up by the wolf packs.Of course, this period of killing and escape were enough to prove the wits of the wolves. The current situation was also meticulously set up by them.When Su Zimo\u2019s strength, energy and all areas were reduced to their worse states, the wolf packs then launched the final battle!Prior to this, Su Zimo hardly used his saber. On the one hand, he did not know the techniques of using one. One the other hand, he wanted to hone his close combat skills as much as possible.Now, Su Zimo\u2019s used a backhand grip and pulled out the Thunderbolt Saber in preparation for the last gamble.\u201cHowl!\u201dThe leader of the wolf pack howled on the top of the valley. The wolves on the two sides as well as front and back of the valley swarmed in like bees!Poof!Su Zimo\u2019s flipped his hands and slashed. He slayed the first wolf that dashed to him into half. Fresh blood was spilling out crazily.Bang!Su Zimo used the Ground-rupturing Palm with his right hand and smashed the skull of another wolf with all his might, splitting the latter\u2019s brains!The killings could not stop the wolves from advancing. On the contrary, it provoked their ferocious nature. Stepping on the corpses of their own clan, the wolves pounced on him continuously.Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!Su Zimo began to use the Plow Heaven Stride. Carrying the saber in his left hand, punching with his right hand, he dashed across the valley with ease, attacking on his left side and charging on his right.If one was watching the combat by the side, he would be shocked at a discovery.Despite being attacked and round up by dense packs of wolves, Su Zimo could still avert most of the attacks and avoid injuries to the vital points of his body.At the sight of the sharp wolf claws about to pierce into Su Zimo\u2019s head, without even looking, he suddenly dodged, punched with his backhand and hurled off a wolf.This was spirit perception!It could sense and avert danger without even looking or listening!In comparison to half a year ago, Su Zimo\u2019s methods had become more simple, direct and succinct. Nevertheless, they were extremely effective.Su Zimo was no longer restrained in his styles. His head, shoulder, wrist, fist, knee and back could all be used to kill the enemies. This was the close combat techniques that he had honed during the fights. It was filled with the smell of blood.It was swift, sharp, fearsome and merciless!Pierce!There was now an additional wound on Su Zimo\u2019s body. Fresh blood was dripping from it.Although he had the aid of the powerful spirit perception, Su Zimo\u2019s body gradually lost it\u2019s strength under such successive and intense attacks.After a round of fierce and violent killings, the wounds that had not fully healed burst open. Blood was spilling non-stop, causing disharmony in his vital energy and blood flow. Su Zimo felt dizzy and was seeing some stars.\u201cI can\u2019t hang on for too long.\u201dSu Zimo gnashed his teeth and stared at the leader of the wolf pack which was not too far away. It was about one feet tall and the size of a huge elephant. Ignoring the attacks from both sides, he charged forward with all his might with the Plow Heaven Stride!Mountain Reliance!Bang! Bang! Bang!A few wolves collided with one another on the spot, spitting blood everywhere.At the same time, Su Zimo also received rampant attacks and suffered many injuries. A piece of his flesh had been torn off by one wolf!Su Zimo\u2019s legs wobbled and he nearly knelt on the ground.Seemingly sensing Su Zimo\u2019s intent, there was a flash of mockery in the eyes of the lead wolf, whose entire body was as white as snow.At this moment, the wolf packs dispersed and the lead wolf gradually made his way over like a victor. He was exuding an endless aura of murderous intent.Su Zimo stared at the approaching wolf. The palm of his left hand carrying the sword was drenched in sweat. He quietly took a deep breath, in preparation for the last strike.Today, it was hard for him to escape death. If he could slay the lead wolf before he perished, he considered himself to have gained something.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dThe lead wolf leaped vertically. A violent aura enshrouded the air and charged towards Su Zimo.Su Zimo opened his mouth and took a deep breath, seemingly devouring the sun and the moon. He lifted his chest high. The pulsation of his flesh and blood was visible on the surface of his skin. The large tendons were knotted together, seemingly coiled by countless anacondas!\u201cP-sst!\u201dFlows of air surged into his lungs crazily, giving out a strange noise.Anaconda Eclipse!This was one of the styles of the Tendons Transformation section. It enlarged the large tendons and could unleash mighty powers instantly!Su Zimo lifted the Thunderbolt Saber using one hand, dashed directly to the lead wolf and aimed for it\u2019s head. At the same time, his right hand threw a surprise attack with the Ground-rupturing Palm!This was already considered Su Zimo\u2019s most powerful strike.There was a flash of fear in the lead wolf\u2019s eyes. The humongous figure was extremely agile. It dodged in the air to avoid the Thunderbolt Saber coming towards him and landed his claw on Su Zimo\u2019s chest.Initially, this claw could penetrate Su Zimo\u2019s chest directly. However, Su Zimo had smashed his hand on the side of the wolf\u2019s body with the Ground-rupturing Palm at the same time.\u201cRoar!\u201dThe lead wolf howled in pain. It was flung by Su Zimo. After rolling on the ground once, it climbed up rapidly and shook its head, seemingly fine.Su Zimo had already ran out of ideas and energy.Although the sharp wolf claws did not punch through his chest, it had mangled it.Su Zimo was thrown off by the explosive impact from the lead wolf\u2019s blow. He looked like a kite with broken strings as he tossed up and then dropped down towards the pack of wolves.Su Zimo had lost all his strength. He swept his gaze across. Beneath him, numerous wolves were salivating and opening their mouth, waiting for the moment that he dropped to tear him to pieces!\u201cIn the end, I still didn\u2019t overcome this\u2026\u201dSu Zimo began to feel dazed.At the sight of Su Zimo falling into the pack of wolves, a figure suddenly flashed in the darkness and swayed past him mid-air. It took Su Zimo away from the corners of the mouths of the wolves in passing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was covered in long hair and smelled nauseating. How could that be Die Yue?Su Zimo struggled to open his eyes to catch a clearer glimpse of the person\u2019s looks.However, a gush of fatigue overtook him. Su Zimo\u2019s vision was getting increasingly blurry.He could vaguely see the dark figure grabbing onto things and swinging to and fro above the valley; his movements extremely swift, agile and light. Shortly after, he had reached the hill top of the valley and got away from the wolf packs encirclement.\u201cGa! Ga!\u201dThe black figure looked back at the numerous wolves in the valley and gave out an eerie laughter. Thereafter, carrying Su Zimo, with two to three moves at a time, he disappeared into the forest.\u2026Not knowing how long had passed, Su Zimo gradually regained his consciousness and struggled to sit up. He was in pain all over and his muscles were numb and aching.Su Zimo looked down and saw that some unknown herbs had been applied on his wounds. They felt light and cool.The rest of the body parts without injuries had also been smeared with some unknown material that emitted a foul and repulsive stench.Su Zimo drew his brows and looked around.This was a rather wide and spacious cave without an extraordinary appearance. However, many wolf skins were hanging on the walls.At this moment, gurgling sounds could be heard coming from the entrance of the cave. A tall and big figure snuggled in. The way he walked was a little odd. He seemed to be tip-toeing and leaping.Su Zimo focused his sight and was stunned on the spot.What came in was not a man but a monkey\u2026He had actually been saved by a monkey?Su Zimo\u2019s mood was a little complicated. During the past six months at Cang Lang Mountain Range, there were at least 800 to 1000 spirit beasts that died in his hands. He did not expect himself to be saved by a spirit monkey in the end.This spirit monkey looked very ordinary. It had super long forelimbs that exceeded the knees when hung down. A dot of red light was swirling in the depths of his eyes. It was a little strange and mysterious.\u201cThank you.\u201dSu Zimo cupped his fists at the spirit monkey.The spirit monkey pursed his lips in a human-like manner. He did not reciprocate Su Zimo\u2019s gratitude. It waved its hands, pointed at the wolf skins on the wall and chattered \u2018Walawala\u2019 for some time.Lastly, the spirit monkey pointed at Su Zimo, extended one of it\u2019s fingers and swaying it from side to side in a mocking manner.It was spiritually enlightened!Besides not knowing how to speak, this spirit monkey was no different from an ordinary man.The spirit monkey could convey the emotions of an adult perfectly with gestures and expressions.Su Zimo could not stifle his laughter. He tried to probe by asking, \u201cDo you mean to say that you didn\u2019t wish to save me at all? It is because you have an enmity with these wolves?\u201dThe spirit monkey opened his mouth and smiled. It nodded.\u201cSince that is the case, we have a common enemy. We can join forces in the future.\u201dSu Zimo had been enduring loneliness in the Cang Lang Mountain Range for the past six months. He also wished to have someone that he could talk to. The spirit monkey before him was extremely intelligent and was no different from a human. It would make an excellent confidant.\u201cSpat!\u201dThe spirit monkey spat and gave a disdainful look. He made a gesture, showing his contempt to Su Zimo, seemingly mocking Su Zimo for being too weak.\u201c\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo was stunned and speechless. He had been looked down on by a monkey.After all, it was his savior \u2018monkey\u2019. Hence, it was not good for Su Zimo to say anything. He looked a little awkward.Su Zimo glanced at the sky through the cave entrance. Suddenly, a doubt arose in his heart.He had been unconscious for at least one day. This time, the wolf packs actually did not chase over?At the smell of that pungent stench on his body, Su Zimo\u2019s eyes shone. He could not help asking, \u201cDo you have a way to cover my body smell to avoid the wolves\u2019 sense of smell?\u201d\u201cGagagaga!\u201dUpon hearing this question, the spirit monkey opened his big mouth and laughed complacently. His eyes were filled with mockery and laughter.Looking at the spirit monkey, Su Zimo suddenly had a bad premonition.Thereafter, he saw the spirit monkey bending and squatting down, showing the posture of passing motion and placing his palms to catch something below his butt. He then wiped the mess all over his body.\u201cThe thing that is smeared on my body is your poop?\u201d Su Zimo turned pale. He asked after much difficulty.\u201cGagaga!\u201dThe spirit beast lifted his head and laughed out loud. He waved his arms and skipped around, as if he had done something proud and great.\u201c\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo had the feeling of being struck by lightning. He endured the the urge to sprout profanities, gnash his teeth and say, word-by-word, \u201cYou\u2026. this damn money. I\u2026 \u201dAt the sight of Su Zimo\u2019s disgust, the spirit monkey looked even more delighted. He chattered \u2018Wo!Wo!\u2019 non-stop and was extremely thrilled.Su Zimo gritted his teeth and said, \u201cDamn monkey, I will definitely fight with you when I fully recover!\u201dThe spirit monkey did not seem to care. It only stood on the same spot and laughed arrogantly while crossing its arms.Su Zimo was covered in pain and wounds. He could not do anything to the monkey for the time being. He lay down swiftly on the ground and tried to calm down.Just as he lay down, not far from his head, Su Zimo saw a red and lush fruit hanging and swaying slowly. It looked juicy and shiny and emitted a tempting fragrance.Su Zimo was thirsty and his mouth dry. Without thinking much, he stretched out his hands and stuffed the red fruit into his mouth.The flesh of the fruit softened as soon as it entered his mouth. The juice was refreshing and sweet, transforming into a surge of warmth into his tummy.The spirit monkey inadvertently witnessed this scene. It\u2019s pupils shrank. Sounds of it\u2019s laughter ceased abruptly.Su Zimo sucked his lips, savoring the good taste of this fruit. When he wanted to look for another one of it, he suddenly sensed a murderous aura in the cave!The atmosphere seemed to have turned stiff.\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo was stunned. He instinctively sat up but nearly bumped into that big face of the spirit monkey.The spirit monkey glared at Su Zimo with bloodshot eyes, gnashing and clenching it\u2019s teeth, panting heavily. It looked like it could not wait to tear Su Zimo apart alive!Su Zimo\u2019s heart stirred. He vaguely guessed that the fruit that he had eaten earlier was probably not ordinary.\u201cHey, you disgusted me once. I ate your fruit. We are even now.\u201d Su Zimo felt a little guilty.\u201cOh! Oh!\u201dAt the sound of Su Zimo\u2019s words, the spirit monkey was fuming with anger. He was so furious that he jumped up and pounded his chest, making deafening \u2018Guang! Guang!\u2019 sounds.The spirit monkey dashed towards the mountain wall beside him and hit his head against the wall. Rocks shattered and flew all over. The sound was terrifying.Su Zimo was secretly shocked.This spirit monkey was very powerful. He might not be it\u2019s opponent even if he were to recover fully and was in his best condition.Fortunately, the spirit monkey did not vent it\u2019s frustration on him. He continued to pound the mountain rocks and almost punched through the mountain walls.At this very moment, Su Zimo suddenly felt his belly warming up and turning boiling hot. Flows of warm air surged towards his limbs and bones, emitting endless flows of heat.Su Zimo\u2019s skin began to redden. It was as if a huge stove was inside him and barbecuing his body. The pain was unbearable.\u201cPsst!\u201dSu Zimo exhaled and looked down. He saw the flesh and blood surrounding his wounds throbbing, integrating and healing at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. Only the scars remained thereafter.In the blink of an eye, the scars came off and the skin was rejuvenated to be like before.Even the piece of flesh on the thigh that had been torn by the wolves was repairing itself rapidly at this moment.\u201cAh!\u201dSu Zimo hollered at the sky. He felt like he was exploding!\u201cThis is bad. This energy is too strong. My body will burst if this continues!\u201dSu Zimo did not have the time to think. He circulated Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation immediately and carried out the breathing and expiration techniques.At the same time, Su Zimo leaped up vertically with the Plow Heaven Stride. He crazily dashed around the mountain cave, constantly practicing the styles of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. He wanted to vent out this surge of energy.The spirit monkey seemed to be shocked by this scene. He stopped rampaging all over the place. Stunned and with his jaws-dropping, it stared at Su Zimo, who seemed even crazier than him.A huge surge of unbearable essence energy ran wildly in Su Zimo\u2019s body, constantly nourishing his body, refining, hardening his skin and stretching his large tendons.He was advancing tremendously in the Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation Realms!Zeng! Zeng! Zeng!The large tendons in Su Zimo\u2019s body throbbed. Sounds of bowstring vibrations could be heard.Initial success of Tendons Transformation!The body\u2019s flexibility and agility had improved. His steps were apparently much swifter and lighter than before. His strength rose rapidly!According to Die Yue, as long as he attained initial success of Tendons Transformation, Su Zimo\u2019s power was enough to be a threat to a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior!Despite the case, Su Zimo still could not transform the huge source of essence in his body.Su Zimo\u2019s skin was torn apart and blood stains covered his body densely. It was a menacing and gruesome scene.\u201cWhat exactly is this thing?!\u201dSu Zimo was terrified. He did not expect that casually taking a fruit almost caused him to lose his life.In fact, this red fruit was famous in the cultivation world. It was the spirit item, Scarlet Flame Fruit, whose flowers bloomed and bore fruit only once in a thousand years.The Scarlet Flame Fruit contained strong and powerful essence. It was a huge tonic. It\u2019s medicinal properties were akin to fire. It was heaty, dry and explosive. No one dared to take it in its raw form. Most people would supplement it with other spirit medicine and refine it into elixirs to moderate the effect and make it convenient to consume too.If not for the fact that Su Zimo was cultivating The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness and had a strong and powerful physique, he would have been consumed by the heat in the fruit and burnt to ashes the moment that he swallowed the Scarlet Flame Fruit.The spirit monkey had guarded the Scarlet Flame Fruit for many years. He was waiting for the Scarlet Flame Fruit to turn ripe in these few days.It initially intended to pick a date and consume this Scarlet Flame Fruit. Unexpectedly, it had been devoured by Su Zimo in one gulp. Neither the fruit nor skin was left.One could imagine how frustrated and upset the spirit monkey was earlier.It was just that, now, at the sight that Su Zimo was in so much pain, the spirit monkey was frightened.The spirit monkey was extremely intelligent. He could tell that if he was the one who consumed this Scarlet Flame Fruit, he would not end up in a better state. Most likely, he would perish.At the thought of this, the spirit monkey felt a little guilty.No matter what, this calamity of Su Zimo was caused by him.The spirit monkey scratched his ears and cheeks and looked at Su Zimo, who was in extraordinary pain and red all over. However, he could not think of any solution.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each time he breathed out, his nose would release a scarlet airstream.The life span of the Perfected Golden Core was at most 500 years.A flower that blooms and bear only one fruit in a thousand years \u2013 What kind of concept would this spirit item possess?This flow of energy was rich and massive. Su Zimo could not endure it at all. He should count his blessings on having sustained for five minutes with The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness.\u201cAh!\u201dSu Zimo hollered at the sky. He had no place to vent out the energy in his body. It was such a torture that he wished to die.\u201cBang!\u201dSu Zimo circulated all the energy in his body and executed Mountain Pressing. He bumped against the stone walls in the cave with all his might. One-by-one, many rocks cracked and fell to the ground.Bang! Bang! Bang!Both Su Zimo\u2019s eyes were red. He repeatedly bumped against the stone walls, seemingly wanting to release all the energy in his body.Each time he bumped against the wall, the cave would shake violently, plummeting gravel. The cave looked like it was going to collapse at any point in time.If the cave were to collapse, it would be akin to a hill top or object weighing up to ten thousands of pounds crashing down. No matter how strong one\u2019s body was, he would be crushed into mud. Death in this place was imminent for a man and a monkey!Su Zimo had already lost his sanity but not the spirit monkey.Obviously, Su Zimo was going to die. He was neither relative nor acquaintance to the spirit monkey. They only met by chance. Escaping from this place as soon as possible would be the wisest option for the spirit monkey.However, there was a flash of worry in the spirit monkey\u2019s eyes at this juncture.The spirit monkey hesitated for a moment and did not choose to leave.Standing by the side, he was on pins and needles. He blinked his eyes constantly, seemingly hoping for a miracle to happen.\u201cBang! Boom! Boom!\u201dAt this moment, deafening sounds could be heard coming from the stone walls. The entire mountain trembled for a while!\u201cOh?\u201dThe eyes of the spirit monkey shone. He discovered that Su Zimo\u2019s knock on this occasion had actually broke the cave\u2019s stone walls and he had fallen into another cave.There was a cave within the cave!The spirit monkey quickened his steps and caught up with Su Zimo. The second cave was narrow and small and there was a small lake in the middle. The air was chilling and icy coldness penetrated one\u2019s bones.Before he could approach the cave, the spirit monkey was already shivering in the cold. He quickly halted his steps.The cool air emitted by the pond was extremely strong and even a little creepy. When the spirit monkey inched closer, a layer of frost appeared and was spreading slowly on his body\u2019s hair. Coldness penetrated him, as if countless steel needles were piercing through his blood and flesh!At this moment, Su Zimo was burning all over. When he sensed the bone-chilling coldness, he did not resist. Instead, he stepped towards the cold lake.The coldness was overwhelming and unbearable.However, Su Zimo, who had eaten the Scarlet Flame Fruit by mistake, seemed to have innumerable flames burning in his body, that could coincidentally offset the effect of the cold.Su Zimo jumped directly into the cold lake. Thereafter, sizzling sounds could be heard as if a striking hot iron bar had been immersed into the icy water.Cold and hot, ice and fire, these two distinct forces collided in Su Zimo\u2019s body.Su Zimo rose and fell in the cold lake, his figure submerged and reappearing from time to time. Vapor rose and mist enshrouded. It felt like an immortal land.The spirit monkey stood and watched this scene from afar. He faintly guessed that Su Zimo had already survived this calamity under a twist of circumstances.As the ancient saying goes, the antidote to any venomous poison will always be present in the latter\u2019s vicinity.Everything in the world mutually reinforced or countered each other. This was the order of nature that would never change.Since the cave had bred such a radical fruit like the Scarlet Flame Fruit, a contrasted and radically cold item should be growing within the vicinity in accompaniment.Su Zimo had taken the Scarlet Flame Fruit by mistake and could not endure the massive energy. Nevertheless, he discovered the cold lake by chance and borrowed the coldness to suppress the searing essence and sealed it into every inch of his flesh and blood!These searing essence had not yet been dissipated from Su Zimo\u2019s body.However, a huge treasure trove had been sealed in his body. Each time he cultivated, he would refine the essence within him until he drained the energy of the Scarlet Flame Fruit!This was greatly beneficial to Su Zimo in advancing in the realms in the future.From the moment that he leaped into the cold lake, Su Zimo had already regained his senses.Soon after, he realized that the energy of the Scarlet Flame Fruit no longer posed a threat as it had been sealed in his body. Su Zimo wanted to jump out of the cold lake but his heart suddenly wavered.Since this place could breed the Scarlet Flame Fruit, could there be other such fruits breeding around the cold lake?The cave where the cold lake was situated was small and narrow. One could see everything in it at a mere glance. Su Zimo did not discover anything. If he had guessed correctly, there was a high possibility that they would be at the bottom of the lake!Su Zimo took a deep breath and plunged into the cold lake.The cold lake was extremely cold. Oddly, there were no signs of freezing. Su Zimo dived deeper and deeper, withstanding the intensifying pressure as he dived. The lakes waters were also getting colder and colder!After cultivating The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, Su Zimo\u2019s ability to hold his breath was very strong. He could hold it for fifteen minutes long.However, as Su Zimo dived deeper, the coldness in his body intensified, his limbs gradually turned cold and his blood circulation slowed down.This cold lake seemed bottomless. Su Zimo realized that he would freeze to death before he could see the bottom of it if he were to continue to swim.At this moment, a beam of red light suddenly streaked across the depths of the corner of the cold lake suddenly.Su Zimo focused his gaze towards the light but he could not see it clearly as the lakes waters were blocking his view. He could only vaguely see a rock with four words engraved present in the deeper waters. The words were very blurry.Su Zimo slid both his arms and dived downwards again. After covering some distance, he had already reached the limit of his physique.Su Zimo opened his eyes wide and looked at that piece of huge rock.Fire!Su Zimo distinctively saw \u2018fire\u2019, one of the four words on the rock.The other three words still looked blurry.Coldness entered his body and Su Zimo shivered all over.\u201cIf this continues, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to die!\u201dSu Zimo dared not continue. He moved all his four limbs and swam towards the surface of the water.Soon after, Su Zimo climbed out of the cold lake. There was a layer of frost on his hair and brows. His lips were purplish and his face was ghastly pale.Swoosh!Su Zimo panted heavily, white clouds of vapor rising from the top of his head.\u201cWowowo!\u201dNot far away, the spirit monkey chattered while staring at him. He was gesturing to Su Zimo anxiously, seemingly asking how Su Zimo was doing.\u201cI am fine.\u201dSu Zimo smiled. After resting for a while, he stood up and left the cold lake.After this round of \u2018torture\u2019, Su Zimo had gained something from the misfortune. He had not only achieved initial success for the Tendons Transformation section but also sealed a massive energy source in his body.This meant that, henceforth, Su Zimo could cultivate at any point in time to refine and absorb the essence sealed in his body without the need to consume any food or drinks.Su Zimo\u2019s mood improved tremendously. He patted the shoulders of the spirit monkey and said smilingly, \u201cDamn monkey. Thanks.\u201d\u201cChey!\u201dThe spirit monkey glanced at the sky and snorted \u2018Hurmp!\u2019. He did reciprocate Su Zimo\u2019s gratitude.Su Zimo could not stifle his laughter.This monkey was very proud. Su Zimo understood it\u2019s temperament a little.Su Zimo stood aside. He stood with his legs apart, parallel to his shoulders, in preparation to cultivate the three styles of Tendons Transformation \u2013 Sanguine Ape Tri-style.Sanguine Ape Fist Seal, Sanguine Ape Fruit Offering and Sanguine Ape Transformation.The first two styles were killing moves while the third style was the core move. Die Yue once told Su Zimo that one could not casually execute the Sanguine Ape Transformation unless he was on the brink of death.When he was surrounded by the packs of wolves in the valley, Su Zimo did not release the Sanguine Ape Transformation because he had not attained initial success of Tendons Transformation. If he were to do so, his large tendons would split, his body would explode and he would die on the spot.Anaconda\u2019s tendons were flexible and resilient whereas ape\u2019s tendons were both strong and soft. The outcome of cultivating ape first would cause the large tendons to burst and split, for they could not withstand the vigorous forces of the constant tugs and vibration. One would become paralyzed.This was the reason for the need to cultivate the anaconda prior to the ape styles.Su Zimo rested for a while. His body straightened. With his left fist guarding his chest, his right fist drew an arc in mid-air and smashed downwards.Sanguine Ape Fist Seal!Right on the heels of that, Su Zimo retracted his fists, bent his knees and shrunk his body like an agile monkey. Seemingly kneeling with one knee, he put his palms together as if he was holding a fruit and lifted them upwards.Sanguine Ape Fruit Offering!Be it name or posture, these two styles did not seem like killing moves.Su Zimo was baffled. He could not figured it out and had a hunch that he seemed to be missing something.\u201cGagagaga!\u201dAt this very moment, a fearless and bold laughter rang in his ears.Su Zimo looked back. He saw that spirit monkey sitting on the ground, laughing out loud and pointing at Su Zimo. His eyes were filled with contempt. He was only short of writing the word \u2018fool\u2019 and similar words on his face.\u201cI have been looked down upon by this damn monkey again.\u201dSu Zimo glared at him and said, \u201cWhat is wrong with you again?\u201dThe spirit monkey stopped mocking. Leaping up, he suddenly dashed towards Su Zimo like an arrow. Both his hands were guarding the chest, his right hand cupped into a fist, drawing an arc in mid-air, charging and aiming at Su Zimo\u2019s head.\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s expression changed greatly.The Spirit monkey\u2019s punch was completely the style of Sanguine Ape Fist Seal. It was exactly the same and even more vicious, filled with a murderous and imposing aura!Su Zimo did not understand the meaning of the word \u2018seal\u2019 in Sanguine Ape Fist Seal previously.He had a moment of realization at the sight of the spirit monkey smashing down his fist.The spirit monkey clenched his fist. It\u2019s greenish-black large tendons protruded, it\u2019s flesh and blood expanding. The fist that swelled up like a huge seal suddenly dropped!There was an explosive sound in the air with this punch!So, that was the case.After easing the tendons, one could make use of the strength of the tendons to tighten the flesh and skin. When the tendons and flesh were knitted together, one would use the fist as a seal. This was the essence of the Sanguine Ape Fist Seal!How much force could a human create by smashing his fist?However, if a huge seal were to smash directly in the face, what would be the outcome?Both Su Zimo and the spirit monkey used the same style but at two completely different levels, there was a world of a difference in impact.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Zimo was taken aback.Su Zimo was suddenly enlightened on the gist of this style. Slightly distracted, he was hit right in the face by the spirit monkey\u2019s punch.The blow was severe. Su Zimo was caught off guard. He was flung out and he bumped onto the stone walls in the cave, causing a huge dent on it. Dense cracks started to appear around the stone wall.\u201cI\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo was dazed by the hit.At one moment, this monkey was laughing in such a carefree manner. In the next moment, he turned hostile and attacked. It was completely illogical.In fact, although the spirit monkey was intelligent and psychic, it did not understand the way humans interacted with one another. Hence, it was not influenced by the fighting and scheming as well as deceiving and blackmailing means in the mortal world.In the forest, the only communication between the demon clan was combatThe spirit monkey was simple and innocent. It retained the most primitive instinct of survival. It would fight or smile when it felt like it. He saved Su Zimo only because of it\u2019s enmity with the wolves. He completely did not care whether Su Zimo was human or demon.When it released it\u2019s punch, the spirit monkey had not even thought of retracting it.If Su Zimo had not cultivated The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness and consumed the Scarlet Flame Fruit, attained initial success with Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation, this Sanguine Ape Fist Seal style would most probably make him half dead!Su Zimo touched the blood flowing out of his nostrils. His face darkened as he said, \u201cDamn monkey, do you wish to fight?\u201d\u201cWowowo!\u201dThe spirit monkey was full of disdain. He curled his fingers at Su Zimo and provoked the latter, chattering continuously.Without a word, Su Zimo got up and released the Plow Heaven Stride. In the blink of an eye, he appeared before the spirit monkey, turned his palm in the posture of rupturing the ground and landed it!\u201cWo?\u201dThe spirit monkey shivered all over, seemingly shocked by the prowess of the Plow Heaven Stride combined with the Ground-rupturing Palm.The spirit monkey seemed to have sensed the powers of the Ground-rupturing Palm. Hence, it did not continue with the fight. It tip-toed and retreated with lightning speed and agility.It was an empty hit but Su Zimo did not take it to heart. He followed on closely.After six months of life and death experiences, Su Zimo had not only cultivated spirit perception but also mastered close combat ability and various kinds of fighting techniques.Su Zimo followed on closely, clenching both fists below his belly. Knuckles protruded, and it was as if a pair of horns was piercing towards the chest of the spirit monkey!At the sight of this, the spirit monkey did not retreat. It attacked instead. It\u2019s body curled, one knee seemingly. At the same time that he dodged the Bovine\u2019s Moon-gazing, both of it\u2019s palms seemed to be holding onto a fruit and lifting it up.Sanguine Ape Fruit Offering!When the spirit monkey executed this style, Su Zimo could not sense the slightest bit of murderous intent.The posture of Sanguine Ape Fruit Offering looked like someone kneeling on one knee and paying respects obediently.However, for some unknown reason, Su Zimo suddenly felt his scalp blistering and also goosebumps breaking out all over his body.The spirit perception that he cultivated told him that a huge killing move was concealed in this style!Su Zimo closed his eyes and retreated rapidly. At the same time, he paid attention to the spirit monkey\u2019s next moves.Pang! Pang! Pang!The initial curl of the spirit monkey\u2019s body suddenly bounced open upon reaching right before Su Zimo. The large tendons in its body were pulsating, sounds of the bowstring ran. It was suddenly releasing and gushing with murderous intent!Thoughts flashed across Su Zimo\u2019s mind. He had faintly grasped the crux of the Sanguine Ape Fruit Offering.On one hand, when his large tendons contracted and suddenly stretched, it would release greater powers.On the other hand, Sanguine Ape Fist Seal first displayed weakness and restrained the murderous intent, followed by a counterattack.Apes loved peach and fruits most but it offered the fruit at this point in time. Something was amiss. When it offered the fruit, it was evident that the ape already had a murderous intent!Bang! Bang! Bang!Su Zimo and the spirit monkey sparred constantly in the cave, feet curling and colliding, palms moving like saber.With Su Zimo\u2019s combat techniques, he could receive and release blows freely. He was forceful and resilient, swift and flexible. He carried an aura that could block the heaven and split the earth.Shortly after, he subdued the spirit monkey.However, it was not easy for Su Zimo to defeat the spirit monkey.The spirit monkey realized that it was difficult to gain the upper hand in the combat. Hence, it began to move in all directions and flee from Su Zimo with swift styles and agile steps.Of course, from the beginning till the end, Su Zimo did not use all of his strength.Hence, although the spirit monkey would occasionally scream loudly, gnashing his teeth, it could still get up and fight again when he was overturned by Su Zimo\u2019s hit.The spirit monkey was a good sparring partner. Su Zimo not only wanted to practice his martial skills but also comprehend the gist of the Sanguine Ape Tri-style as much as possible.A human and a monkey did not interact much but they had an indescribable, tacit understanding with each other.In the time to come, Su Zimo lived in this cave.A man and a monkey occasionally went out to look for trouble with the wolf clan. After killing many wolves, they fled before the wolves could round them up.Of course, Su Zimo refused to smear himself with the spirit monkey\u2019s poop anymore. He found a type of herb that could conceal his smell and avoided the wolves.Outside the cave, Su Zimo and the spirit monkey joined forces to kill wolves.After returning to the cave, after just a few interactions, a human and a monkey would indulge in a sparring match.Later on, when the spirit monkey realized that he could not gain the upper hand, it felt indignant and started to do sneak attacks.Sometimes, when Su Zimo was resting, eating or sleeping, the spirit monkey would sneak up to punch him before turning and escaping, then make funny faces at Su Zimo from afar, laughing arrogantly and loudly as if it was the victor.After some time, as Su Zimo\u2019s spirit perception became increasingly acute, the spirit monkey found it hard to succeed in his sneak attacks.In the blink of an eye, another five months passed.The one year of test in Cang Lang Mountain Range was almost coming to an end.During this period, Su Zimo had been refining the energy of the Scarlet Flame Fruit and devouring blood and flesh at the same time. The Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation Realms advanced continuously towards phenomenal success.Su Zimo\u2019s body was coordinated, it could be hard or soft; and his strides were as light as a raccoon. When he walked, there was no sound in the air and no traces in the snow. He leaped and shuttled in the dense forest like apes. Using the old tree branches as his support, his feet did not even need to touch the ground.Of course, to Su Zimo, his close combat ability had improved the most.In Cang Lang Mountain Range, there were not many spirit beasts that were Su Zimo\u2019s match now.A man and a monkey seemed to have become the lord of the place. Many spirit beasts would choose to retreat at the sight of them.Su Zimo had a hunch that the cold lake in the cave was not ordinary. During this period, he dived into the cold lake countless times, wanting to explore it.However, before Su Zimo could travel to the lakebed, bone-chilling coldness would penetrate his body and slow down his blood circulation, showing signs of freezing. He would return without any success each time.Today, Su Zimo planned to check out the cold lake one last time before he left the Cang Lang Mountain Range.Not long after, Su Zimo rose to the surface of the water. He could not hide the disappointment in his eyes and shook his head.He still did not succeed.Body Tempering and Tendons Transformation sections trained the flesh, blood and large tendons. In the deeper waters, the three body parts could endure the invasion of the cold but when the coldness penetrated the bones and seeped through the blood veins, Su Zimo could not endure it longer.In The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, the two sections after Tendons Transformation were Bones Strengthening and Marrow Cleansing.\u201cIt seems that I have the capability to get close to the bottom of the lake only after cultivating the Marrow Cleansing section. I can come again and explore at that time.\u201d Su Zimo said secretly.He did not know where the spirit monkey went. Perhaps it went out to look for the wolf clan\u2019s trouble.Su Zimo was not worried.The spirit monkey was extremely alert and intelligent. Although there were many spirit beasts in Cang Lang Mountain Range, it was difficult for them to hurt it.Furthermore, during this period, the spirit monkey\u2019s ability had improved much after sparring and fighting with Su Zimo.Su Zimo was most curious of something. The spirit monkey seemed to have learned the Tendons Transformation section before.The spirit monkey not only knew the Sanguine Ape Tri-style. His usual breathing and expiration was also similar to that in the Tendons Transformation section. Yet, it was a little different.It seemed a little strange.When Su Zimo questioned the spirit monkey, it seemed to be a taboo. It always averted his question.Later on, Su Zimo no longer questioned him.Today, Su Zimo did not leave the cave. He intended to bid farewell to the spirit monkey upon its return and then return to Ping Yang Town.One year had passed. Su Zimo missed the Su family very much, especially his older brother and younger sister.Of course, Su Zimo also look forward to meeting Die Yue again.In the blink of an eye, the sun gradually descended and it was almost evening.The spirit monkey had not returned.Su Zimo furrowed his brows. There was a flash of worry in his eyes.Cang Lang Mountain Range was very eerie at night. Scary spirit demons would often appear, looking for prey. Although Su Zimo and the spirit monkey were very powerful, they were not a match for spirit demons.Hence, before the night arrived, they would return to the mountain cave.The situation of the spirit monkey not returning for the entire day had never happened before.Su Zimo felt very uneasy. He suddenly stood up and drew out the Thunderbolt Saber that was pierced in the stone wall. He tied it to his back and stepped out of the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - You Are the One Courting Death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosThe sky gradually darkened. It was almost evening.It was extremely dangerous to tread in Cang Lang Mountain Range at this hour. Even Su Zimo could not guarantee his own safety. If he were to encounter spirit demons, the odds would not be in his favor.However, Su Zimo still decided to look for the spirit monkey.The spirit monkey had not only saved his life but also was deeply bonded to him. After six months\u2019 of interaction and numerous sparrings, a man and a monkey had gradually forged a close relationship.Getting along with the spirit monkey was much easier than getting along with humans.Mutual sincerity was the only requirement.Although the spirit monkey loved to fight and poke fun at Su Zimo, it would not lie to or make use of him. There was neither mutual deceit and distrust nor plotting against each other.It was easy to identify the spirit monkey through it\u2019s awful body odor. After getting a few whiffs outside the cave, Su Zimo decided to dash towards a certain direction.It was only later on did Su Zimo realize that this monkey had a special preference for its own poop. Hence, the fact that it was willing to smear it\u2019s poop on Su Zimo meant that it had treated him as one of its own.Along the way, Su Zimo encountered many spirit beasts.However, Su Zimo did not engage in any fights with them. Instead, he detoured and continued to search for the spirit monkey via the latter\u2019s body odor.Most of these spirit beasts recognized Su Zimo. Hence, they would not court trouble by looking for him on their own accord.Not long after, Su Zimo halted his steps. Both his ears wriggled and captured the faint sounds of weapons clashing against one another.\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo narrowed his eyes.Why would there be sounds of weapons clashing in Cang Lang Mountain Range?Even Connate Experts dared not venture deep into Cang Lang Mountain Range, especially when night was nearing.Cultivator!This word flashed across Su Zimo\u2019s mind. His expression was as capricious as the weather.If it were one year ago, like an aggressive and ignorant rookie, Su Zimo would be very eager and thrilled to fight them on.However, having gone through a year of solid training, Su Zimo was not as immature and impetuous as before.Most importantly, cultivators who dared to remain at Cang Lang Mountain Range in the evening were definitely at advanced realms. They could not possibly be Level 1 or 2 Qi Refinement Warriors!Most of the spirit beasts in Cang Lang Mountain Range were not threats to the spirit monkey. However, the situation would be different if the spirit monkey were to encounter a cultivator.At the thought of this, Su Zimo crawled on the ground with both his hands and legs. He was twisting and turning like an anaconda slithering across the forest without a single sound.Anaconda Swath!The first style of Tendons Transformation was to approach the opponent without a sound.The sound of weapons clashing ahead were becoming increasingly clearer and intensive. In between the clashes, he could even hear the sounds of some men taunting and a woman snarling.Under the dark and misty sky, Su Zimo lay in the grass and observed the battle that was occurring about ten feet from him.The trees and plants surrounding the battle had already been cut by the weapons. A relatively wide and spacious open space could be seen. Five men dressed in taoist robes were surrounding and attacking a lady in yellow robe.Each of the five men was controlling a flying sword and brandishing both hands. It was as if an invisible force was connecting the flying sword to the individual.The yellow-robed lady was also controlling a flying sword. There was a layer of frost on the sword. Apparently, this sword was more superior than those in the hands of the five men.The flying sword seemed very light and agile under the control of the yellow-robed lady.The yellow-robed lady seemed to have some treasure with her. When she was occasionally pierced by the other party\u2019s flying sword, a glowing shield would light up around her body. However, the shine of the shield got dimmer and dimmer as time passed.The yellow-robed lady was fighting against five people. Her strides looked clumsy; it seemed that she could not hold up any longer. She was obviously disadvantaged now.At the sight of the fighting and killing between the cultivators, Su Zimo felt that he had widened his horizons.Su Zimo retracted his gaze and looked at the other side.Beside the battlefield, two men were watching the fight. Their attires were completely the same as those five men on the battlefield. Obviously, they belonged to the same group.There was a spirit monkey standing in between the two men. It was covered with injuries but looked arrogant and indignant; it\u2019s eyes shining with a murderous aura.Su Zimo focused his gaze. Both the fore and hind limbs of the spirit monkey had been cuffed tightly by two iron hoops. The sharp spikes inside the rim of the hoops had already pierced into it\u2019s flesh.The spirit monkey had completely lost its freedom. It was hard for it to move an inch!Su Zimo had never fought with the cultivators and did not know their tactics. He was further unaware of the realms that these few cultivators were at.However, a murderous intent rose in Su Zimo\u2019s heart at the thought that the spirit monkey was in trouble. His gaze was cold and sinister.Su Zimo pondered for a moment. He did not strike immediately. Instead, he lowered his body and hid himself more.This was because he knew that once he strikes, he must kill his enemies at once. He could not give the opponent any time to react!This was not a one-to-one combat.He faced a total of seven cultivators!A Qi Refinement Warrior with a gaunt and thin face smiled and said lustfully, \u201cYoung lady, your Augmentation Talisman won\u2019t be able to hold out long. I advise you to surrender. Otherwise, you will suffer!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Swords and daggers don\u2019t have eyes. If they cut your little face accidentally, it will be such a pity.\u201d\u201cHaha, you have been poisoned with our Pisces Aqua Powder. You can\u2019t hang on for too long, even if you are a Foundation Establishment cultivator!\u201dThe yellow-robed lady arched her brows in anger, her expression chilly and aloof. She said coldly, \u201cThe few of you are courting death. You\u2019re just Qi Refinement Warriors. I\u2019m a cultivator from Azure Frost Sect. If you know what is good for you, quickly surrender!\u201dSu Zimo was stunned.He did not expect the yellow-robed lady to be a Foundation Establishment Cultivator.The frightening thing was that she was seemingly poisoned by the Pisces Aqua Powder. Hence, she would not be a match for these five Qi Refinement Warriors!As to the Augmentation Talisman mentioned by that Qi Refinement Warrior, Su Zimo had heard about it.One of the Qi Refinement Warriors, who had a large face, sneered. \u201cHey, since we know that you are a cultivator of Azure Frost Sect, the more we can\u2019t let you off. You have fallen into the Joyful Seven\u2019s hands. We\u2019ll make you feel so ecstatic that you will crave for death. Be obedient!\u201dSeemingly distracted by these words, the flying sword controlled by the yellow-robed lady halted for a moment. As a result, she was pierced by two other flying swords.Clang! Clang!A shield with a golden glow appeared around the yellow-robed lady and blocked the two flying swords. However, upon the impact of the blow, the shield was filled with cracks and looked like it would break at any point in time!The yellow-robed lady pursed her red lips without saying a word. She defended with all her might and refused to concede defeat.On the other hand, the bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior beside the spirit monkey looked relaxed. He said smilingly, \u201cWe have gained a lot in this trip to Cang Lang Mountain Range. This lady definitely has a lot of treasures with her. Most importantly, be it face or figure, this lady is of supreme-grade. She will be a delight for the seven of us. Haha.\u201d\u201cThat said, if we don\u2019t have the Beast Trapping Hoop that master passed down to us, we really won\u2019t be able to take down this monkey,\u201d said another Qi Refinement Warrior who was carrying a long rod. There was a lingering fear in his heart.The bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior sneered and said, \u201cAfter we return, let\u2019s torture this monkey and force it to pledge a blood oath. I don\u2019t believe that we can\u2019t subdue a beast!\u201dWhen the two saw that the outcome was quite certain, they could not help relaxing a little and chatting casually.At this moment, there was a bloody shine in the spirit monkey\u2019s eyes. Initially rooted to the ground, it suddenly turned its body and opened its mouth wide, revealing it\u2019s sharp teeth as it bit the neck of the Qi Refinement Warrior beside him!The spirit monkey\u2019s limbs could not move as they had been bound. However, biting was an innate skill of it since the day it was born.If it could successfully bite the Qi Refinement Warrior, the latter would not have any chance of surviving!The spirit monkey was tall and big. It had to lower it\u2019s head to bite the Qi Refinement Warrior who was relatively shorter. In addition, it\u2019s body was restrained. As such, it\u2019s action was slightly delayed and that person reacted in time.The countenance of the Qi Refinement Warrior holding the rod changed. He quickly dodged.Pierce!Although he had avoided being bitten on the vital point of his neck, a big piece of flesh on his shoulder tip had been torn off by the spirit monkey. Fresh blood was spilling out from it!\u201cAh!\u201dThe Qi Refinement Warrior cried in pain, looking ghastly pale. He touched the small cloth bag below his waist and a porcelain bottle appeared in his palm.He opened the bottle and took out a tuft of powder-like substance before applying it on his wound. This stopped the fresh blood from dripping. It was very amazing.After the Qi Refinement Warrior managed his wound, he lifted his steel rod furiously. There was a flash of light and the rod landed hard on the knees of the spirit monkey. He scolded, \u201cBastard, kneel down!\u201dThere was a loud thud on the ground.The spirit monkey trembled. Flashes of pain could be seen in its eyes.However, this hit by the rod did not make the spirit monkey kneel down. On the contrary, it provoked it\u2019s murderous instinct!The spirit monkey chewed the piece of torn flesh rampantly, revealing a ferocious and menacing glare. It then swallowed it in one gulp. Thereafter, it turned to face the Qi Refinement Warrior and laughed \u2018gaga\u2019 loudly with a mocking look in its eyes. He was untamed, obstinate and unyielding.\u201cBastard, you\u2019re courting death!\u201dAt the sight of the spirit monkey\u2019s behavior, the Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s fury intensified. He did not care whether his wound would burst open. He lifted the steel rod again and smash it towards the top of the spirit monkey\u2019s head!At this very moment, a cold voice rang in his ears.\u201cYou\u2019re the one courting death!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You actually sneaked up behind me quietly and I didn\u2019t notice it?\u201dBefore he could finish his thought, his head hurt and he lost consciousness immediately.Initially, the Qi Refinement Warrior who was standing at the other side looked relaxed when he saw his comrade teach the spirit monkey a lesson agitatedly. He did not expect to see such a terrifying and eerie scene!A distance away, the bush had moved a little but the bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior did not take it to heart.However, a figure mysteriously appeared behind his comrade in the next moment. Enshrouded by the misty and dark skies, the intruder exuded a towering murderous aura, as if he was a ghost from hell.It happened too quickly and suddenly!The intruder slammed his palm on the head of the Qi Refinement Warrior holding the rod. The latter was caught off guard and could not defend himself at all.Poof! Poof! Poof!The head of the Qi Refinement Warrior holding the rod was actually pressed directly into his chest. Blood-chilling sounds of flesh and blood bursting could be heard coming from the neck!The bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior looked aghast. Just as he was about to shout out loudly, he saw the intruder taking successive moves. The figure stretched his legs had reached him in just two strides.The murderous aura was pervasive!This overbearing aura forced the bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior to swallow the words in his mouth back into his throat again.The bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior instinctively stretched out his hands towards the cloth bag on his waist. He calmed down slightly only when a flying sword landed in his hands.However, before the Qi Refinement Warrior could draw out his flying sword, the intruder\u2019s palm had already landed on him.Pa!The skull of the bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior was smashed in just one hit. His brains split and he died on the spot!In actual fact, when the spirit monkey tried to bite the Qi Refinement Warrior holding the rod, Su Zimo had already began taking action.However, as both parties were about ten feet away from each other, Su Zimo dared not increase his speed, for fear of being discovered.When Su Zimo reached these two Qi Refinement Warriors\u2019s sides, they were destined to meet with a fatal calamity.The entire process seemed very slow upon narration but in fact, it occurred in the split of a moment.To top-notch martial experts, this moment was especially crucial!\u201cOw! Ow!\u201dThe spirit monkey recognized Su Zimo. His eyes lit up and he was overjoyed. He shouted loudly to express the excitement in his heart.Su Zimo ignored the spirit monkey. Without a word and carrying a calm demeanor, he had slayed the bald-headed Qi Refinement Warrior. Twisting and moving, he charged straight to the other battlefield.Long before he attacked, Su Zimo had already made the preparations.Once he attacked, he had to give it his best shot and crumble the other party in lighting speed.Putting aside the obvious point that these seven Qi Refinement Warriors were ill-intentioned, the painful torture that they administered to the spirit monkey alone had already provoked Su Zimo\u2019s murderous instinct.Most importantly, if he were to let off any one of them, they would become a source of endless trouble!Su Zimo heard very clearly that these seven individuals were from the Joyful Clan. Who knew what strong and powerful cultivators were in this clan? Would they hunt him down?On the other battlefield, five Qi Refinement Warriors from the Joyful Clan jumped in shock at the sudden change in circumstances.Who would have thought that two of their clan mates would die grievously in a matter of moments?The most perplexing thing was that the intruder was clad in skins of beast and full of black stubble on his face. He looked like an uncivilized, primitive wild man. They also could not sense any flow of spirit qi from his body.He was not a cultivator?Such a barbarian could actually kill two Level 6 Qi Refinement Warriors in the blink of an eye?The five of them already did not have the time to think, because this barbarian had already dashed to them with a pervasive murderous intent and monstrous aura!There was a flash of cruelty in the eyes of the fat-faced Qi Refinement Warrior who was facing Su Zimo. He smiled grimly, \u201cWhere did this barbarian come from? You have no sense of danger!\u201d\u201cJee!\u201dThis fellow snarled and directed his flying sword to the oncoming Su Zimo.A beam of light shone from the flying sword. The sword\u2019s aura intensified. It was so extraordinary.Su Zimo closed his eyes briefly. Facing this flying sword, he had initially planned to use the Bovine-tongued Saber to shatter or hurl away the sword.However, Su Zimo\u2019s acute spirit perception told him that this sword was very powerful and might possibly injure him.Su Zimo charged forward in lighting speed. However, the flying sword was lunging at him at an even faster speed.If it was one year ago, Su Zimo would not be able to react in time, let alone dodge this flying sword.However, today, Su Zimo suddenly lowered his body. All of his four limbs exerted strength as he twisted his body, staying close to the ground. Agile and swift, he had a close shave with the flying sword. In a matter of moments, he appeared in front of the fat-faced Qi Refinement Warrior.The Qi Refinement Warrior was stunned; the colors on his face drained.Su Zimo suddenly got up. His body and four limbs became as soft and flexible as an anaconda. It coiled onto the plump body of this man. Large tendons pulsated, flesh and blood expanded and the entire body exploded with energy!After Anaconda Swath, he executed another killing move of Tendons Transformation \u2013 Anaconda Strangle!All the spirit beasts in the Cang Lang Mountain Range were aware. After being bitten by the anaconda, one might still escape. However, if one\u2019s body were to be coiled by the anaconda, they would die for sure!Even if one\u2019s body was strong enough to wrestle with the anaconda, he would eventually die of suffocation.In the past six months, although the spirit monkey often sparred with Su Zimo, it had never dared to allow Su Zimo to close up on and coil it.This Qi Refinement Warrior did not have a body that was as strong and resilient as the spirit monkey. After Su Zimo wrapped and strangled it, all the bones in his body were crushed. Deafening sounds of \u2018Pa! Pa!\u201d could be heard. It was horrible and gruesome.Poof!Bloody fog filled the air. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, a burly figure burst open on the spot and turned into a puddle of fleshy mud.This was the true powers of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness!After killing this man, Su Zimo did not stop. He used Plow Heaven Stride and headed towards another Qi Refinement Warrior with a gaunt and frail face.Although Su Zimo was unaware of the cultivation realm of the five Qi Refinement Warriors present, using his spirit perception, he could vaguely sense that the fat-faced Qi Refinement Warrior who died earlier and the one before him right now were the greatest threats to him.He could reduce the chances of an accident to the lowest if he could kill the two of them first.At the sight of Su Zimo killing three people, the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior wore a grave expression. He instantly became cautious. A ray of light burst out from his fingertip and entered the flying sword. The flying sword flickered and shone brightly.\u201cGo!\u201dThis flying sword dashed towards Su Zimo, it\u2019s movements as swift as thunder and as fast as lighting.One of the three Qi Refinement Warriors who were attacking the yellow-robed lady also came forward and directed his flying sword to pierce the middle of Su Zimo\u2019s back.The two Qi Refinement Warriors concentrated on rounding up and attacking Su Zimo!Su Zimo seemed to have eyes grown on his back. Without even turning back, as he was charging forward, he dodged and got away from the flying sword piercing towards his back.Simultaneously, Su Zimo used his backhand to grip the Thunderbolt Saber on his back, spread his arms and slashed towards the flying sword coming towards him.\u201cClang!\u201dEar-piercing sounds of weapons clashing could be heard. The Thunderbolt Saber chipped off after colliding with the flying sword. Cracks appeared around the chip. Obviously, the saber was ruined and could no longer be used.Su Zimo was stunned.Since he got hold of the Thunderbolt Saber, it had always been of use to him. It could even slash the skin, hair, flesh and blood of spirit beasts. Unexpectedly, it almost shattered into pieces after colliding with the agile, long and slim flying sword of the cultivator!Su Zimo\u2019s expression did not change. He was not bothered.This was because he had already achieved his objective. The Thunderbolt Saber had hit the flying sword, Riding on the shocking energy that exploded from his body, it had already sent the flying sword on a deviated route that was some distance away.The flying sword that should initially pierce into Su Zimo\u2019s skull only passed through the passage beside his cheek.Right from the beginning, Su Zimo had never paused his attacks for a single moment. His speed only increased!He was closing in!Su Zimo used the Thunderbolt Saber to block the flying sword so that he could shorten the distance between he and the thin and frail Qi Refinement Warrior.Su Zimo remembered Die Yue\u2019s words by heart. Most of the cultivators\u2019 bodies are relatively weak. As long as you can avert their first wave of attack and take the chance to shorten the distance between both of you, you will be able to make use of the strong and powerful close combat ability of the demon clan to slay them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As soon as he flipped his hand, the Ground-rupturing Palm was violently executed towards the face of the other party!The skinny Qi Refinement Warrior was very alert and quick to react. At the sight of Su Zimo dodging the Flying sword, he had searched out a face mirror from the cloth bag on his waist and chanted something.The mirror enlarged instantly, glistening and crystal clear.Su Zimo had long noticed the small cloth bag hanging on the waist of the cultivators. It seemed to be a Cosmic Bag. Whenever they touched it, they could retrieve something.However, Su Zimo did not find it unusual. Compared to the methods that Die Yue used to open up a big and spacious cultivation field, these small cloth bags were obviously much weaker.In a hurry, the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior lifted the mirror in his hands to shield his head.Bang!Crack! Crack! Crack!Su Zimo\u2019s hands landed on the mirror of the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior. First, there was a deafening sound of an explosion. Immediately after, lines of cracks appeared on the mirror surface.\u201cAh!\u201dThe skinny Qi Refinement Warrior gave out a miserable cry. His arms had been instantly crushed by the powers reflected by the surface of the mirror. His veins and bones shattered and his body was flung off!This time, Su Zimo dared to hit with his bare fists.On the one hand, it was because he sensed that the mirror did not have any attack properties. On the other hand, the surface of the mirror did not shine when the other party took it out.As expected, this mirror had been destroyed in one hit by Su Zimo. The skinny Qi Refinement Warrior almost died on the spot!He fell to the ground, looking as white as a sheet and shrieking, \u201cWho are you? How dare you intervene in the matters of my Joy Clan!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill your people!\u201dSu Zimo sneered. He moved forward with large strides, wanting to end the life of this skinny Qi Refinement Warrior.At this very moment, Su Zimo sighted a flash of strange looks beneath the eyes of the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior.\u201cMmm? Not good!\u201dSu Zimo was stunned. He quickly moved backwards.This was the first time that Su Zimo was involved in a fight with a cultivator. He had to be extremely cautious, for fear that the other party might catch him off guard with some methods that he was unaware of.Splash!The skinny Qi Refinement Warrior suddenly raised his hand and dispersed a powder that emitted a faint fragrance.Nevertheless, Su Zimo was a step quicker in moving backwards and did not come into contact with this mist of powder.\u201cComrade, this is the Joyful Reunion Powder. You must not breathe this in!\u201d The sound of the yellow-robed lady could be heard. It was gentle and beautiful, carrying a tinge of anxiety.Su Zimo frowned and looked at the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior who was hiding in the mist of powder. He paused for a moment.If he were to wait for a while, these powder would naturally disperse and not pose a threat. However, Su Zimo could not waste time because there were three more cultivators nearby.Su Zimo decisively turned and gave up on that fellow temporarily. He then charged towards the person behind him.At the sight of the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior being reduced to a handicapped by one hit of the palm, the man behind Su Zimo had long turned pale with fright. He quickly controlled the flying sword to charge at Su Zimo\u2019s glabella with all his might!There was no flicker or shine of light in this flying sword.Su Zimo closed his eyes and did not intend to dodge it. Maintaining the posture of downward thrust, he stuck out his right hand and gently lay it on the oncoming flying sword.Wrap, hit, pull!Swash!Although this flying sword did not break, it had been thrown aside by Su Zimo. It landed in the mud, slanted.This Qi Refinement Warrior was stunned.Although he was only controlling a low-end Item Spirit, he had never seen anyone receiving a spirit weapon with bare hands and not suffering any injury.What kind of monster was this?After a moment of dawdle, Su Zimo appeared by the side of this man. His body curled, one knee seemingly kneeling, his palms put together and lifted up!Sanguine Ape Fruit Offering!Bang!This lift up happened to support the chin of this Qi Refinement Warrior.Sounds of breaking could be heard coming from the neck bones and chin of this man. His head fell backwards and hung on his back. His eyes were wide open, filled with horror. He was already dead.There were two more Qi Refinement Warriors attacking the yellow-robed lady. At the sight of this, they were instantly scared out of their wits.Su Zimo spread his body and charged towards one of them. Left hand guarding his chest, right hand clenched into a fist, large tendons pulsating, blood and flesh expanding, his fists turned into seal and landed from the sky with a deafening thud.A large shadow engulfed, covering the sky and the sun!This Qi Refinement Warrior was stunned so badly by Su Zimo\u2019s aura that both his lungs and guts were splitting. How would he dare to try to attack or defend? He hurriedly turn and tried to flee.Believing that he was going to escape from the scope of the large seal above him, he was elated.At this very moment, he could hear the sounds of bow strings vibrating. It was petrifying.Pang! Pang! Pang!Su Zimo\u2019s large tendons stretched and his arms swelled and enlarged. The gigantic seal came crashing down, caught up with that Qi Refinement Warrior who was fleeing in panic and landed on the top of his head.Poof!After his skull exploded, there was still some left over energy in the gigantic seal. It immediately crushed and shattered this man\u2019s body.At the sight of five of his clan mates dying and one being severely injured, the remaining Qi Refinement Warrior lost his cool. While he was distracted, the yellow-robed lady controlled the flying sword and circled his neck once.A large head was hurled off and fresh blood splattered. The headless corpse fell to the ground and twitched from time to time without any consciousness.The yellow-robed lady was covered in delicate beads of sweat. After killing this man, her chest was heaving and she was panting slightly, seemingly to have reached the limit of her physique.Su Zimo turned and looked at the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior who lost his arm.However, he discovered that the other party had seized the opportunity to escape to a distance. His right hand was pressing onto his wound. With a flying sword under his feet, he traveled through the sky and disappeared into the forest immediately.Su Zimo frowned.At this moment, it was too late for him to chase him. Or rather, even if he could catch up with him, Su Zimo could not do anything to him as he was high in the air.Suddenly, Su Zimo discovered that he had a fatal weakness.He could not fly in the sky.If the Qi Refinement Warrior were to execute the Sword Kinesis Flight immediately before fighting him, he could only be attacked and could not strike back.After this round of killings, night had gradually fallen. One could vaguely hear the roaring sounds of the spirit beasts shaking the heavens and earth.Looking at the back view of the skinny Qi Refinement Warrior in the darkness, there was a flash of worry in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes.This man\u2019s escape was ultimately a calamity.No one knew when this calamity would begin to erupt.However, another thought flashed across Su Zimo\u2019s mind. Night had fallen and it was the time where spirit beasts and spirit demons come out preying. This man\u2019s broken arm would emit a strong stench of blood. He might not leave the Cang Lang Mountain Range alive.\u201cOw! Ow!\u201dThe spirit monkey\u2019s shouts interrupted Su Zimo\u2019s deep thoughts.The spirit monkey was tied up. He leaped about on the ground that he was standing at, shouting at Su Zimo. It wanted him to help it remove the iron hoops around it\u2019s limbs quickly.\u201cStay there obediently first. Who told you to run around?\u201dIt was a rare sight for the spirit monkey to be defeated. Su Zimo deliberately cast him aside and went to the corpses of the few cultivators. He removed the six small cloth bags from their bodies and tucked them into his arms without even looking.Although he did not know what they were, Su Zimo could sense that these small cloth bags were quite famous and seemed to be Cosmic Bags. It definitely contained many treasures.Su Zimo turned and picked up a flying sword that had fallen to the ground.The shape of this flying sword was a little unique. It did not have a handle but only a blade that was extremely sharp.Typical people would have problems holding it.However, this was not much of an issue for Su Zimo.Su Zimo held onto the sharp blade with his bare hands and walked to the spirit monkey. He aimed at the iron hoops that bound the spirit monkey\u2019s limbs and slashed hard!Clang!Sparks were flying everywhere.A white streak appeared on the iron hoop but it did not break.Su Zimo furrowed his brows slightly.This flying sword could even shatter the Thunderbolt Saber. Yet, it could not break the iron hoops on the spirit monkey\u2019s limbs.This was a little troublesome.Su Zimo could faintly sense that it was not because the flying sword was not sharp enough, but because he did not use it correctly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Yao XuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosJust as Su Zimo was deep in thought, the yellow-robed lady gradually approached him and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m Yao Xue from Azure Frost Sect. Thank you for saving me and fighting for justice, comrade.\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s thoughts were focused on how to remove the hoops from the spirit monkey\u2019s forelimbs. He only glanced at Yao Xue but did not reply.Yao Xue pondered shortly before saying, \u201cComrade, you wish to remove this Beast Trapping Hoop, right? Why don\u2019t I give it a try?\u201dSu Zimo took a hesitant glance at Yao Xue before nodding.Yao Xue tapped the flying sword in her hands gently. Two flashes of light appeared and a layer of frost covered the blade of the sword instantly. The aura of the sword was appalling!Su Zimo looked on conscientiously.Earlier on, only one flash of light appeared on the flying swords of the two Qi Refinement Warriors from Joyful Clan. However, there were two flashes of light on the flying sword in Yao Xue\u2019s hands now.Obviously, the sword in this lady\u2019s hands was of a better quality. The blade was also sharper!Su Zimo quietly memorized this and paid careful attention to Yao Xue\u2019s every move.He saw Yao Xue controlling the flying sword\u2019s movement from a distance. When her slim and fair finger pointed forward a little, the flying sword drew an arc in mid-air and slashed the Beast Trapping Hoop hard.Pa! Pa!Coinciding with the noise, the Beast Trapping Hoop broke.Having felt aggrieved for some time, the spirit monkey was thrilled after breaking free from the restraint. Oblivious to it\u2019s bleeding wounds, it chattered \u2018Ow, Ow!\u2019 continuously.\u201cThank you.\u201dSu Zimo nodded to Yao Xue.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Yao Xue smiled. Suddenly, a doubt arose in her heart and she could not help asking, \u201cIs this a spirit beast that you reared and nurtured?\u201dYao Xue could tell that this wild man who was clad in hide knew the spirit monkey. Most likely, he intervened in this matter because he wanted to save the spirit monkey and then saved her in the passing.In the cultivation world, many cultivators would rear and groom spirit beasts to improve their combat ability. Once the spirit beast had pledge a blood oath, they would not betray the cultivator. Otherwise, they would be punished by heaven and die from a reflux of their own blood flow.Upon hearing this question, Su Zimo frowned, shook his head and said, \u201cHe is my friend.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dYao Xue blinked her eyes. She was very puzzled. It was really hard for her to imagine how a human could become friends with a spirit beast.Since ancient times, human and demon were of different paths and in constant fights with each other. Their relationship was getting from bad to worse. There was only one possibility of interaction \u2013 a master and slave relationship whereby one party had taken a blood oath.The term \u2018friend\u2019 truly seemed a little unique when it came to the two different clans. After all, there was an ancient saying that those of different clans would not be of the same heart and mind.Su Zimo ignored Yao Xue. He approached the few corpses and picked up the five flying swords.Looking at the broken Thunderbolt Saber, Su Zimo felt a little hesitant. In the end, he still picked it up and tied it behind him.Suddenly!Su Zimo sensed great danger and turned behind.In the deep parts of the forest behind him, two dots of dimmed lights appeared in the darkness. The aura was terrifying. They were exuding a chilling murderous intent!\u201cPsst!\u201dSu Zimo exhaled a breath of cold air in shock. He said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a spirit demon. Quickly leave!\u201dBefore Su Zimo spoke, the spirit monkey had already ran off. Although it was injured and limping, it could still move swiftly and agilely in the forest.Yao Xue was obviously a little panicky and at a loss of what to do.Su Zimo did not plan to bother about her initially. However, this lady had helped to chop the Beast Trapping Hoop earlier. If he were to leave her behind, she would most probably die here given her current state.Su Zimo took a glance at her and said in a low voice, \u201cFollow me!\u201dJust as he spoke, Su Zimo had already begun to move forward. Yao Xue\u2019s cheeks blushed faintly. She gritted her teeth and quickly followed him.Yao Xue had been poisoned with the Pisces Aqua Powder. She would not be impacted much if she could force out the poison and nurse her injuries.However, she had just been engaged in a fierce battle with the Joyful Seven earlier and almost exhausted all her spiritual powers. She could not even fly by standing on her flying sword. As such, she gradually could not endure the effects of the Pisces Aqua Powder; she felt her entire body heating up and limbs numb.Yao Xue was very clear of the effects of the Pisces Aqua Powder. No matter how strong-willed one was, one would not be able to endure the power of this drug.\u201cIf I can\u2019t endure it, I will rather be devoured by this spirit demon than to be humiliated by others.\u201d Yao Xue bit her cherry-red lips and quietly decided.The spirit monkey had long disappeared after running off. That wild man in front of her appeared faintly from time to time. Yao Xue tried her best to chase up to him.The unknown spirit demon behind followed her closely. It\u2019s chilling gaze was like a thorn on her back, never disappearing for a moment.After running for a while, Yao Xue\u2019s legs were wobbly. She almost tripped and fell onto the ground.Although she was already prepared to be buried in the beast\u2019s mouth, she was terrified at the thought that she would be torn apart and devoured by the spirit demon.Sounds of the spirit demon treading on the grass behind her were getting closer and closer. The murderous intent was pervasive and cold. Yao Xue could even smell the fishy breath of spirit demon\u2019s mouth.However, at this very moment, Yao Xue did not have the energy to run anymore.\u201cForget it\u2026 To think that I, Yao Xue, would die at this place. If father knows about this\u2026 sigh.\u201dYao Xue was totally exhausted. She stood still, panting. She felt aggrieved and sorrowful. Closing her eyes, two streaks of tears flowed down quietly.At this moment, Yao Xue suddenly felt a strong and sturdy arm on her waist. Thereafter, her body felt light. Someone had taken her away from the place.\u201cMiss, pardon me. There is a need to adapt to the change in circumstances.\u201d The man\u2019s voice rang beside her ears.Yao Xue opened her eyes wide and saw the side view of Su Zimo\u2019s face.\u201cSo he didn\u2019t leave me behind.\u201dAt this moment, Yao Xue had indescribable joy in her heart. She seemed to have found a place to vent all her grievances and sufferings now. Tears streamed down her face.Swoosh! Swoosh!Winds howled and shadows of trees retreated.The man held six flying swords with his left hand and one person with his right hand. Yet, this did not slow him down. Instead, he moved even faster!It was only until now did Yao Xue realize that this man did not use all of his strength during the earlier stretch of journey. Otherwise, she would not have been able to catch up with him.\u201cThis person is not bad.\u201dYao Xue was drained of energy. Leaning closer to the man who carried her, the Pisces Aqua Powder was continuously taking effect, causing her thoughts to run wild.Yao Xue was stunned. She quickly bit the tip of her tongue and tried hard to maintain soberness.Dashing left and limping right from time to time, the man seemed to be very familiar with the Cang Lang Mountain Range. Although Yao Xue could hear the spirit beast roaring, they did not encounter any attack.After an unknown period of time, Yao Xue felt dizzy and could no longer control her body.Yao Xue was gradually losing her consciousness.At this moment, the man\u2019s voice rang again, \u201cMiss, wake up!\u201d\u201cOo. Oo.\u201dYao Xue\u2019s body was feverish and she was sleep-talking.Swoosh!Sounds of water could be heard.Ubiquitous feelings of coldness surrounded Yao Xue\u2019s burning body. Shivering, Yao Xue sobered up; her pair of eyes gradually regaining sight.\u201cT- this.. Where is this?\u201dShivering, Yao Xue asked and looked at the surroundings.This was a small and narrow mountain cave. She was in the middle of a cold lake, and there was nothing around it.Although the effect of the Pisces Aqua Powder was still present, the bone-chilling coldness from the lake waters constantly stimulated Yao Xue\u2019s nerves and allowed her to maintain sober.\u201cYou are a Foundation Establishment Cultivator. Coupled with the aid of this cold lake, you will most likely be able to defuse the effects of the Pisces Aqua Powder.\u201dAfter saying these words, the man turned and left.Before leaving, that man found a few pieces of wolf skins and covered the entrance of this small and narrow cave.Sounds of the man\u2019s steps gradually faded away.Noticing all these, feelings of strangeness rose in Yao Xue\u2019s heart.After falling into the lake, her clothes were already drenched. Nevertheless, the man did not peep at her at all. He was also very meticulous. He covered the cave\u2019s entrance as he was afraid that she would feel awkward.Although the effect of Pisces Aqua Powder was strong, it did not constitute as a threat to Foundation Establishment Cultivators.Yao Xue was feeling miserable that she did not have a chance to force the effect of the Pisces Aqua Powder out. Now that she was sober again, she quickly searched out an elixir from her storage bag and put it into her mouth. She then began to circulate the spirit heart sutra.At this very moment, she could hear the man\u2019s voice mingled with the spirit monkey\u2019s chatters outside. A man and a monkey seemed to be communicating.The man\u2019s voice was neither loud nor soft. The volume was just audible to Yao Xue.Yao Xue felt her heart warmed.That man used such a method to tell her that he would always stay outside the cave. He was neither too far from nor too close to her. Hence, she could heal her injuries without any worries.\u201cThis man\u2026 is really interesting.\u201d Yao Xue smiled gently. She looked so beautiful and flawless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The spirit monkey was waiting for him outside.The spirit monkey laughed \u2018gaga\u2019, pointing to the inside of the cave. He winked and made faces at Su Zimo with a strange expression. He even wiggled his body a few times.Su Zimo cursed and laughed. \u201cThis damn monkey. You know everything.\u201dIn actual fact, although Su Zimo had not heard of the Joyful Reunion Powder, he could vaguely guess the purpose and effect of this drug.He had studied for more than a decade. Su Zimo would not take advantage of another person in a perilous state, not to mention that both of them met by chance.\u201cHow are your injuries?\u201d Su Zimo asked.\u201cWowo.\u201dThe spirit monkey waved its hands to express that it was fine.The spirit monkey\u2019s physique was amazing and body healing capabilities were extremely strong. It would recover in a few days\u2019 time.After being silent for a while, Su Zimo said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dThe spirit monkey widened it\u2019s big eyes. They were filled with puzzlement.In the cognition of the spirit monkey, Su Zimo was similar to him. He lived in the Cang Lang Mountain Range, had no one to rely on or turn to, and had no strings attached.Su Zimo pointed to the direction of Ping Yang Town and said, \u201cThere is a town about a few dozens of kilometers from Cang Lang Mountain Range. My home is over there. I have to go back now.\u201dThe spirit monkey stopped shouting. Tears welled up in its eyes. It looked a little sad. Turning its back, it quietly licked the wounds on his body.Su Zimo felt a little complicated too.In Su Zimo\u2019s eyes, the spirit monkey was no longer the initial savior that it was.The spirit monkey was a friend whom he ate, lived and shared weals and woes with. Su Zimo had also thought of bringing the spirit monkey with him but this was not realistic.On one hand, Su Zimo was worried that the spirit monkey could not get used to the outside word. On the other hand, he was worried that he would not be able to protect the spirit monkey.The spirit monkey was obstinate and unyielding. It was also eccentric and untamed. He did not know what kind of huge trouble it would stir up outside. Life outside might not be safer, happier and more carefree than life in the Cang Lang Mountain Range.\u201cComrade, you can come in.\u201dAt this moment, the gentle voice of that lady could be heard coming from inside the cave. It broke the pin-drop silence outside the cave.Su Zimo patted the spirit monkey\u2019s shoulders and stepped into the cave first.Although the night was dark, after cultivating The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, Su Zimo\u2019s eyesight was superb. At the sight of Yao Xue, he could not help being slightly stunned.Yao Xue\u2019s beauty was astonishing. Her beauty surpassed that of Shen Mengqi and was comparable to Die Yue. It was just that she did not have the unique charisma on Die Yue.Yao Xue had just gotten out of the cold lake. Her black tresses were still wet. She looked like a beauty who had just gotten out of a bath, with a touch of gentleness. She was very attractive.Su Zimo was a little distracted but resumed his normal self after a moment.Looking at the current Yao Xue, he guessed that the effect of the Joyful Reunion Powder had already faded.Su Zimo nodded at Yao Xue and walked to his usual resting place. He searched out the few small cloth bags from the Joyful Clan and fidgeted with them curiously.\u201cComrade, I still don\u2019t know your name?\u201d Yao Xue smiled and asked.\u201cSu Zimo.\u201dSu Zimo responded without even looking up. He continued to fidget with the cloth bags in his hands.Yao Xue looked at Su Zimo, who was not far away. Recalling the embarrassing state that she had been in when poisoned by the Joyful Reunion Powder, she could not help blushing and feeling shy.Yao Xue gently gritted her molars. Her distracted eyes glancing everywhere. She tried to appear casual as she asked, \u201cJust now\u2026 I\u2026 \u201d\u201cJust now, Miss lost your consciousness. Nothing happened.\u201d Before Yao Xue could finish her words, Su Zimo added.\u201cOh.\u201dYao Xue furrowed her brows when she discovered that Su Zimo seemed reluctant to respond to her. He had been fiddling with the storage bags in his hands. She could not help feeling a little annoyed at heart.After watching by the side for a while, Yao Xue could not help asking, \u201cComrade, you don\u2019t seem to be a cultivator?\u201dSu Zimo paused. He observed Yao Xue\u2019s eyes and said calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t have a spirit root.\u201dAt the sound of these words, there was not the slightest bit of contempt in Yao Xue\u2019s eyes. On the contrary, there was a flash of shock and regret.This subtle change made Su Zimo feel a little positive about Yao Xue.Yao Xue approached Su Zimo. She sat on the ground, not minding the dirt and mess. She said jokingly, \u201cThen I won\u2019t address you as comrade anymore. It\u2019s only right that I call you Mister Su.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d Su Zimo smiled.Yao Xue pointed at the cloth bags in Su Zimo\u2019s hands and said, \u201cThis thing is a storage bag. It is a very common item in the cultivation world. Almost everyone will bring one with him. It is a Cosmos Bag and can store a lot of items.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cHowever, the storage bag will only open after one uses spirit qi to stimulate it.\u201dWhile talking, Yao Xue took a storage bag and patted it with her palm. A pile of items dropped onto the ground. Most of them were bottles and jars. There were also dozens of stones the size of a fist.\u201cThese are spirit stones. This is something that a cultivator cannot do without. There are three grades of it \u2013 supreme-grade, middle-grade and inferior-grade. These few are inferior-grade spirit stones.\u201d\u201cAs for spirit root, it can be categorized into five grades \u2013 pseudo spirit root, ordinary spirit root, superior-class spirit root, earth spirit root and the most rare heaven spirit root\u2026 \u201dYao Xue was very smart. Seemingly, she could tell that Su Zimo was very curious about cultivators. Hence, she tirelessly told him about the common information of cultivators.Die Yue hardly talked about such things. Hence, Su Zimo could not help but be immersed in this information.One party was humble to learn and the other party spoke without any reservation. Before they knew it, it was already dawn and one night had passed.Even if one was a cultivator, he would feel tired after having a sleepless night.Su Zimo looked apologetic. He got up and said, \u201cMiss Yao, regarding this information on cultivators, thank you for teaching me generously. I have gained a lot.\u201dYao Xue smiled and said, \u201cIf you wish to thank me, give me three pieces of wolf skins. This is also my purpose for this trip.\u201dThere were hundreds of wolf skins inside this cave. Su Zimo waved his big hands and said, \u201cTake as much as you want.\u201dYao Xue said, \u201cActually, everything on the spirit beasts are treasures. To a Talisman Master, hides are a necessity. You have so many spirit beast hides in the cave. If you sell them, you will be able to get many spirit stones in return.\u201dYao Xue had told Su Zimo earlier. In the cultivation world, there were four types of cultivators with a very special status. Their status was even higher than that of ordinary cultivators.The Elixir Refinement Master could refine elixirs. There were numerous kinds of elixirs with a wide scope of usage. To cultivators, elixirs were indispensable.The Weapon Refinement Master could refine various types and grades of spirit weapons. To cultivators, spirit weapons could significantly improve their ability and were also indispensable.The Talisman Master could create talismans. The Augmentation Talisman that Yao Xue used to block the attacks of Joyful Seven earlier was one of such talismans. Without the Augmentation Talisman, Yao Xue would have long been defeated and captured.The Array Formation Master was proficient in the formation of arrays. Many of the major clans had major defensive array formations. If the cultivators were to fall into any of the arrays set up by opponents, they would be restrained everywhere and their lives might even be threatened.Of course, the prerequisite for becoming one of these four types of cultivators was the possession of a spirit root and becoming a Qi Refinement Warrior.Su Zimo shook his head and said, \u201cEven if I can exchange for spirit stones, I have no use for them.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201dYao Xue said immediately, \u201cYou have to know that one piece of inferior-grade spirit stone is worth a thousand taels of gold. In some trading houses of the cultivation world, various and numerous kinds of items are available for sale. One will have to use spirit stones to trade for these items. If you have enough spirit stones, you can even assign some assignments and engage the Qi Refinement Warriors to complete them. Of course, the higher the realm that the Qi Refinement Warrior is at, the higher the cost of hiring.\u201dUpon hearing this, Su Zimo\u2019s heart wavered. He had a vague feeling that these spirit stones might really be of some use.After pondering for a while, Su Zimo asked again, \u201cAt what realms were the Joyful Seven at?\u201dYao Xue said, \u201cThose two guarding the spirit monkey were the weakest. They are Level 5 Qi Refinement Warriors. The one who escaped and the fat-faced one were the strongest. They are both Level 8 Qi Refinement Warriors. The remaining three were Level 7 Qi Refinement Warriors.\u201dSu Zimo nodded.One year of training and experience had not been in vain. Now, even Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior was not his match.Su Zimo even had a hunch that Level 9 Qi Refinement Warrior would also be in danger if he were to close in on him!Of course, this was on the pretext that the other party would not execute the Sword Kinesis Flight at the first instance.In fact, Sword Kinesis Flight would deplete a lot of spirit qi. In fights and battles, be it Qi Refinement Warrior or Foundation Establishment Cultivator, they would save as much spirit qi as possible for use in attacking the opponent.With both feet on the ground, the other party could still defeat you by controlling the flying sword even if one were to execute Sword Kinesis Flight.Hence, in the midst of killings and fightings, almost none of the Qi Refinement Warriors or Foundation Establishment Cultivators would execute Sword Kinesis Flight and attack at the same time.This would not only cause distraction but also deplete a lot of spirit qi.Of course, it would be a different matter when it came to the Perfected Golden Core realm.The ability of the Perfected Golden Core was vastly different from the two mentioned before. One of the abilities was that the Perfected Golden Core could completely lift himself off the ground without relying on any foreign object!\u201cWhere do we go to sell these items?\u201dSu Zimo had quite a huge harvest yesterday. He had six storage bags. There were about seven hundred pieces of spirit stones in total. In addition, there were other flying swords, elixirs and so on.Yao Xue said, \u201cIn the Great Zhou Dynasty, the largest trading house is the Sky Treasure Pavilion. Sky Treasure Pavilion will set up branch stores In the town of cities where cultivators gather. Most of them are situated in the cities of the various states where the kings live in.\u201d\u201cSky Treasure Pavilion?\u201d Su Zimo said in slight puzzlement. He frowned. \u201cThere seems to be one in Cang Lang City.\u201dWhen he was studying at Cang Lang City previously, Su Zimo had unintentionally heard of Sky Treasure Pavilion. He heard that it was a place that was even more mysterious than the palace.The gathering of the cultivators? Cang Lang City, Sky Treasure Pavilion?Su Zimo narrowed his eyes, seemingly pondering about something.\u201cSince they are cultivators, why would they intervene in pugilistic and royal court affairs of the mortal world?\u201d Su Zimo asked again.Yao Xue explained, \u201cThe Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s life span is almost similar to that of ordinary people. Even a Foundation Establishment Cultivator\u2019s life span is at most over a hundred years. It is so hard to attain alchemy. When they see that they have no hopes of attaining alchemy, most of the Qi Refinement Warriors and Foundation Establishment Cultivators will enter the royal court and enjoy a materialistic and carefree life in their remaining years.\u201d\u201cOf course, when there are traces of cultivators in various states, most of them belong to the Qi Refinement Warriors. However, it is said that in the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2026 one of the armies is solely formed by the Foundation Establishment Cultivators and there are even some Perfected Golden Cores in the dynasty. This is the reason why the Great Zhou Dynasty stands towering like a giant and dominates the various states!\u201dCountries such as Da Qi and Yan all belonged to the vassal states and had to pay tribute to the Great Zhou Dynasty every year.Su Zimo suddenly had a realization. \u201cIt is no wonder the Great Zhou Dynasty hardly intervenes in the battles of the various states. This is because the rise and fall of any states will not threaten the rule of the Great Zhou Dynasty.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Yao Xue nodded.After pausing for a moment, Yao Xue smiled and said in a profound manner, \u201cThe Cang Lang City is one of the cities in the state but Sky Treasure Pavilion set up a branch there. It seems that the City Lord of this city is conceiving a huge plan.\u201dSky Treasure Pavilion would only set up a branch in places where the cultivators gather. This implied that Cang Lang City had many cultivators!What did the City Lord of Cang Lang want to do?Was it related to the Su family?Su Zimo vaguely felt that the Su family had very likely gotten itself into a massive vortex, and it would be shattered into pieces in the event of any slip up!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Where is Cang Lang City? Bring me there, please.\u201d Yao Xue said smilingly.Su Zimo could tell that Yao Xue was very sensitive and considerate. She was worried that he could not enter the Sky Treasure Pavilion on his own as he was not a Qi Refinement Warrior. As such, she told him that for fear of hurting his self-esteem.Su Zimo did not expose her lie either. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It is also time that I leave Cang Lang Mountain Range.\u201dSu Zimo packed up many spirit beast hides. Besides these, he also put away the storage bags and flying swords harvested yesterday in Yao Xue\u2019s storage bag temporarily to avoid appearing too ostentatious.Outside the cave, the sky was already bright.The spirit monkey curled himself up in a corner with his back facing the two of them. It seemed to be sound asleep.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Don\u2019t disturb him.\u201d Yao Xue said softly.Su Zimo shook his head. He went to the side of the spirit monkey and kicked it without giving any warning. He chided smilingly, \u201cStop pretending to be dead. Wake up and send me off!\u201dThis kick was very sudden and forceful. Even Yao Xue was taken aback.Unexpectedly, the spirit monkey who was initially sleeping soundly seemed to be long prepared for this. Swoosh! It dashed up and avoided Su Zimo\u2019s underhanded kick. Teeth gnashing and jaws opened, it waved both arms at Su Zimo with a face full of disdain, and rolled its eyes from time to time.Su Zimo smiled faintly and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to send me off, so be it. Look at you. Damn monkey. Be smarter next time. Don\u2019t foolishly go lose to the cultivators when you meet them.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201dThe spirit monkey snorted and waved it\u2019s fists.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dWith his back facing the spirit monkey, Su Zimo waved his hands and left the cave with Yao Xue.Not far away, Su Zimo sensed something and instinctively turned back. He saw the spirit monkey standing at the cave entrance and watching him from afar. Under the reflection of the morning glow, the tall and big figure looked a little lonely and desolate.At the sight of Su Zimo turning back, the spirit monkey felt that he could no longer stifle his expression. Lifting its head proudly, it turned and wriggled back into the cave, disappearing from sight.Yao Xue noticed this and said softly, \u201cIn the end, it came out to send you off.\u201dSu Zimo hung his head silently.Yao Xue said, \u201cSince you can\u2019t bear to leave it. Bring it along?\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Su Zimo looked up and smiled. Pretending to be casual, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t need to bother about him. This monkey has great ambitions. It wants to be the lord of Cang Lang Mountain Range, a happy and carefree king of the mountains.\u201dYao Xue found a flying sword from the storage bag and suspended it in the air. She jumped onto it. She then turned to Su Zimo and said, \u201cCome up. It\u2019ll be faster in this way.\u201dSu Zimo did not decline. He leaped onto the flying sword immediately.Swoosh!Lights from the sword flashed. The two had already disappeared from the place that they were at at lighting speed.Sword Kinesis Flight was as graceful and swift as a startled swan. It was breezy, carefree and indescribable. Su Zimo would be lying to himself if he were to say that he was not envious.However, he was on the path of demon cultivation. He would have to cultivate the Core Formation section to rise from the ground and fly in the air.After Tendons Transformation, there were four major realms \u2013 Bones Strengthening, Marrow Cleansing, Organs Refinement, and Orifice Clearing. He did not know how long it would take.\u2026After one and a half years, he felt completely different upon returning to Cang Lang City.Looking at Cang Lang City from the heights while on Yao Xue\u2019s sword, Su Zimo discovered that this city was much bigger than he had thought it to be.The two landed in a quiet and deep small alley. There was a wall at the end of the small alley.Before Yao Xue reached the wall, she pointed with her finger and release a flow of spirit qi. Before hitting the wall, it had turned as clear as a water curtain at that instant.Yao Xue explained, \u201cThis is a kind of array formation. It has the effect of a visual bulwark. Mortals without spirit qi will not be able to discover this place. There are two ways to enter the Sky Treasure Pavilion. First, become a cultivator. Second, possess the Sky Treasure Badge.\u201dSu Zimo nodded and followed Yao Xue in crossing the wall. It was spacious and bright on the other side. A sparkling and glittering palace appeared right in front of them.Three words \u2018Sky Treasure Pavilion\u2019 was written on the plaque.Under the bottom right corner of the Sky Treasure Pavilion, there was an exquisite and small word \u2018branch\u2019, representing that this was a store branch of the Sky Treasure Pavilion.After entering the main hall of the Sky Treasure Pavilion, one could see many Qi Refinement Warriors loitering around.The main hall was filled with plenty of treasures collected in the cultivation world. There were elixirs, spirit items, talismans, cultivation technique secret manuals and so on. It had everything that one wished for.\u201cFollow me upstairs. These items downstairs are all ordinary ones.\u201d Yao Xue whispered.Under the envious gaze of many Qi Refinement Warriors, Su Zimo followed Yao Xue upstairs.These Qi Refinement Warriors were aware that only Foundation Establishment Cultivators or those with the Sky Treasure Badge could be granted access to the second floor of the Sky Treasure Pavilion.However, it was too difficult to attain a Sky Treasure Badge. Even the most inferior-grade Sky Treasure Bronze Badge required a certain number of spirit stones in exchange for the eligibility.On the second floor, there were obviously less cultivation world treasures. However, each of the items looked better than those downstairs.Apart from a few Qi Refinement Warriors who were selling items, no one else was present. It was very quiet.Yao Xue knocked on the table. She flashed a piece of exquisite, gold badge and said in a low voice, \u201cGet your pavilion manager out!\u201dThe Qi Refinement Warrior was startled instantly. He responded to the rudeness with a flattering smile. \u201cSenior, please wait here for a moment.\u201dVery soon, a figure dressed like a businessman hurried over. He was rather plump but swift in his movements.\u201cSelling something.\u201dYao Xue went straight to the point. She took out the hundreds of spirit beast hides, various elixirs and the few flying swords.Su Zimo had already planned to sell everything and exchange them for spirit stones.\u201cIt will be a total of 3,070 pieces of inferior-grade spirit stones.\u201d The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion calculated before he wiped his sweat and said.Yao Xue waved her hands and said undoubtedly. \u201cLet\u2019s round it to 3,100.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 okay.\u201d The manager hesitated slightly but agreed thereafter.Su Zimo suddenly realized that Yao Xue seemed to be born of an extraordinary origin. Every move of hers was filled with a strong aura of elegance.3,100 pieces of spirit stones. Coupled with the 700 other pieces in the storage bags of the Joyful Seven, Su Zimo had close to 4,000 spirit stones now!This was also considered a huge wealth amongst the high-level Qi Refinement Warriors.\u201cHow do you intend to use this sum of spirit stones?\u201d Yao Xue asked.Su Zimo had some plans in his heart. He said in a deep voice, \u201cI want to refine two weapons. One bow and one saber.\u201dAfter the battle with Qi Refinement Warriors at Cang Lang Mountain Range, Su Zimo discovered his own weakness. He was unable to leave the ground and fly in the sky.If he were to encounter Qi Refinement Warriors who used Sword Kinesis Flight in the future, Su Zimo would deal with them with his bow and arrows!As for the saber, apart from protecting himself and attacking the enemy, it could also block the spirit item of the Qi Refinement Warrior and take the chance to reduce the distance separating them.Besides inferior-grade, middle-grade, superior-grade, supreme-grade weapons, there was also another type of spirit weapon called pseudo spirit weapon.The reasons why spirit weapons were powerful were twofold. On one hand, the materials used to refine the weapons were rare spirit items. On the other hand, after numerous hammering and refining by the Weapon Refinement Master, the impurities had been removed. The weapon would not break easily as it was both hard and strong.Most importantly, one had to look at the spirit pattern condensed on it to analyze the grade of the spirit weapon.An inferior-grade spirit weapon would have one spirit pattern. Amongst the Joyful Seven, two of them had flying swords of this grade.The flying sword in Yao Xue\u2019s hands was a middle-grade spirit weapon as it had two spirit patterns.Weapons with three spirit patterns were superior-grade while those with four spirit patterns were of supreme-grade!Before the cultivators engaged in a fight, it would inject the spirit qi into the spirit weapon. This would invigorate the spirit pattern to shine. The more lines there were, the more powerful the spirit weapon.The so-called pseudo spirit weapon was referring to weapons made of the same materials as the real ones. They were also made by the Weapon Refinement Master but there was no spirit pattern condensed on them.To Su Zimo, whether the weapons had spirit pattern or not did not make a difference. He could not invigorate them at all.As long as the weapon was strong and hard enough to block the impact of spirit weapons and cause death and injury to the Qi Refinement Warrior, it would suffice.The manager of the Sky Treasure Pavilion said, \u201cIt costs very little to refine two pseudo spirit weapons. Including the costs of materials and hiring the Weapon Refinement Master, a few hundred inferior-grade spirit stones are enough.\u201d\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d Su Zimo could feel that the Su family was going to face a calamity soon. He wanted to improve his ability as soon as possible.\u201cAt least three days.\u201d The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion said. \u201cOn a separate note, it is easy to refine the bow but not the bowstring.\u201dYao Xue pointed at Su Zimo\u2019s waist and smiled gently. \u201cThe python tendon on your waist can be used as a bowstring.\u201dSu Zimo was still clad in a beast hide and a python tendon was used as a belt. Yao Xue reached out her hands and gently pushed Su Zimo, covering her nose. \u201cQuickly bathe and change your clothes. You can remove the python tendon then.\u201dSu Zimo coughed lightly to conceal his embarrassment. He quickly followed the two female waiting staff and left the second floor of Sky Treasure Pavilion temporarily.Not long after, Su Zimo returned to the Sky Treasure Pavilion. When Yao Xue glanced at him from the corner of her eyes, she could not help feeling stunned.At this moment, Su Zimo was dressed in a green robe. He had shaved away his stubble. Bright, clear eyes and delicate features, he exuded a strong scholarly aura. He was like a different person from before!\u201cEh, who is this?\u201d Yao Xue turned both her palms, leaned forward slightly and moved closer to him. She tilted her head and asked with a trace of a smile in her eyes.Su Zimo\u2019s gaze was bright and clear. He smiled but was silent.\u201cA young master, indeed. Addressing you as Young Master Su is really not wrong.\u201d Yao Xue smiled and said.Su Zimo could barely endure this. He cupped his fists and said, \u201cMiss Yao Xue, you\u2019re being humorous.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll not tease you anymore.\u201d Yao Xue waved her hands and asked, \u201cWhat do you intend to use the remaining spirit stones for?\u201d\u201cHow many spirit stones do I need to hire a Qi Refinement Warrior?\u201d Su Zimo planned to hire one Qi Refinement Warrior to protect the Su family.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion said, \u201cThis depends on the level that the Qi Refinement Warrior is at.\u201d\u201cThe higher the better!\u201d\u201cFor a Level 7 Qi Refinement Warrior, five pieces of inferior-grade spirit stones a day will be enough. For a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior, you need ten pieces a day. For a Level 9 Qi Refinement Warrior, you need 100 pieces!\u201dSu Zimo did some mental calculations.He had a total of over 3,000 pieces of spirit stones left. Of course, it was good to hire a Level 9 Qi Refinement Warrior. However, he only had enough spirit stones to hire one of them for a month.No one could guarantee when the danger would come.On the other hand, hiring a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior could protect the Su family for an entire year. It was relatively more cost effective.After pondering deeply for a while, Su Zimo said, \u201cI\u2019ll hire a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior for a period of one year.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe manager waved his hands. One of the female waiting staff nodded and walked towards the main hall on the first floor of the Sky Treasure Pavilion.Yao Xue explained. \u201cThere are always new missions at the main hall of the Sky Treasure Pavilion. If the Qi Refinement Warriors are interested in them, they will look for the hirers accordingly.\u201dAfter pausing for a while, Yao Xue passed the piece of gold badge in her hands to Su Zimo. She said. \u201cThis is the Sky Treasure Pavilion Gold Badge. With this badge, you can get half the price for every item of purchase when you come here next time.\u201d\u201cSo much?\u201d Su Zimo was shocked.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion who was standing at the side explained, \u201cThere are three types of badges in the Sky Treasure Pavilion. The lowest grade is the bronze badge which will give you a ten percent discount. Next is the silver badge that gives a twenty percent discount, followed by the gold badge.\u201d\u201cThis item is too precious and costly. I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d Upon hearing the manager\u2019s explanation, how could Su Zimo not know how precious this gold badge was?\u201cAccept it. I still have more of it.\u201dNot allowing any further deliberations, Yao Xue tucked the item into Su Zimo\u2019s arms and reminded him, \u201cYou have to hide it well and don\u2019t let anyone see it. Otherwise, you will attract trouble easily.\u201dSu Zimo frowned and wanted to decline again. Yao Xue face turned stiff, \u201cYou saved my life. Isn\u2019t my life worth this piece of lousy gold badge?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo was speechless.The manager at the side rolled his eyes continuously, muttering in his heart, \u201cLousy gold badge\u2026 there are less than 10 such gold badges in the entire Great Zhou Dynasty! This madam is so generous. I don\u2019t know where this poor lad\u2019s good fortune came from.\u201dAt this moment, Su Zimo was unaware that the Sky Treasure Gold Badge in his hands was not an ordinary one.Even if he had the ordinary Sky Treasure Gold Badge, he could only get a thirty percent discount at the Sky Treasure Pavilion.There was only one place with Sky Treasure Gold Badges that could give a fifty percent discount!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He said sincerely, \u201cI must thank Miss Yao Xue for today\u2019s matter.\u201d\u201cCall me Yao Xue.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 Okay then.\u201dSu Zimo hesitated slightly before he agreed.At the sight of Su Zimo nodding, Yao Xue pursed her lips and smiled. She said immediately, \u201cI\u2019ll call you Zimo then.\u201dSu Zimo, \u201c\u2026 \u201dYao Xue took a sideways glance at Su Zimo and asked, \u201cWhere will Zimo be going next?\u201dSu Zimo pondered deeply and said, \u201cI have to stay in Cang Lang City for a few days to wait for the two spirit weapons to be refined. At the same time, I will check out if any Level 8 Qi Refinement Warriors are taking up the mission.\u201dAfter thinking, Yao Xue said, \u201cI\u2019ll return to my clan then. I won\u2019t keep you company.\u201d\u201cHave a good trip. We will meet again if we have fate.\u201d Su Zimo nodded.Yao Xue jumped onto the flying sword. When she was about to leave the Sky Treasure Pavilion, she suddenly looked back and gave a charming smile. \u201cNot if we have fate. We will definitely meet again.\u201dUpon finishing her words, Yao Xue leaped onto her sword and left. She disappeared from Su Zimo\u2019s sight soon after.Su Zimo did not think much of it. He left the small alley of the Sky Treasure Pavilion and looked for an inn nearby to stay at.\u2026Three days later, in the mansion of the City Lord.Cao Gang, the wolf guard, stepped in and bowed to pay his respects. He said in a low voice, \u201cCity Lord, my subordinate\u2019s guard saw Su Zimo in the city. The strange thing is that\u2026 this lad seemed to have appeared out of thin air. No one saw him entering the city.\u201dLuo Tianwu, the City Lord of Cang Lang City nodded and said, \u201cYes, perhaps we have been negligent. No need to worry. I have long received news of this and sent someone to test him. Since we are making use of him to kill, we have to test if this blade is sharp enough!\u201d\u201cI heard that, some time ago, Su Hong had a narrow escape from death in the capital of the Country of Yan. 16 years of preparation work fell short in the last battle. He nearly lost his life. Now, the capital of the Country of Yan is tightly guarded. Many Qi Refinement Warriors were gathered near the King of Yan. What can this Su Zimo do?\u201d Cao Gang frowned slightly.Luo Tianwu smiled and said, \u201cSu Hong has black armored cavalry under his wings. He was powerful but also too ambitious. It is expected that his assassination of the King of Yan would fail. But this Second Young Master Su is different\u2026 No one views him as a threat. The more you neglect one\u2019s existence, the easier it is for him to carry out a successful assassination.\u201d\u2026Su Zimo had been in Cang Lang City for three days but did not hear any news from Sky Treasure Pavilion.The hiring of Qi Refinement Warrior was not as easy as he expected it to be. Furthermore, he wanted to hire a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior.Su Zimo felt a little vexed. He was prepared to have a meal at the first floor of the inn.Just as he arrived downstairs, he could hear people sneering. Someone said in an eccentric manner, \u201cYo, isn\u2019t this Second Young Master Su who has been reduced to an inferior commoner? Why do you still have the shame to come to Cang Lang City?\u201dSu Zimo slanted his eyes and saw a seemingly wealthy young man with a graceful bearing waving a fan. Sneering continuously, he had a look of contempt on his face.Two middle-aged men were by his sides. They were bright-eyed and had a restrained aura. They were seemingly guarding the young man who was sitting in between them.This young man\u2019s name was Chu Liang. He could not take the hardship of learning martial arts but was also reluctant to focus on his studies quietly. With the power of his family clan as his backing, he lounged around all day long, bullying the young and weak.Su Zimo had some impression of this man as he had been his classmate back then when studying in Cang Lang City previously. Although he could not see eye to eye with this man\u2019s conduct, the two never had any animosity between them.Su Zimo cast a faint glance at Chu Liang. His gaze was calm and his expression normal. He then turned back and ascended the stairs.The Su family already had enemies on another land. Su Zimo did not wish to attract more trouble. It was pointless to make more enemies.Chu Liang sneered. \u201cBoss Lee, when did your inn start to take in inferior commoners? Break both legs of this inferior commoner and throw him out, in case he affects my appetite!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe boss of the inn looked like he was in a difficult position.\u201cYes? You want to break both my legs?\u201dSu Zimo halted his steps and turned gradually, his gaze sweeping across the main lobby.The guests in the inn did not seem to be ordinary commoners. They had weapons on the table beside them. Although they were also eating and drinking, their gazes inadvertently landed on him. Moreover, there were traces of hostility in their eyes!This was not a chance encounter. The other party deliberately came here to seek trouble!In the blink of an eye, Su Zimo had figured it out.Su Zimo strode towards Chu Liang. The two middle-aged men by Chu Liang\u2019s side showed obvious signs of nervousness. The muscles tightened as they lowered their palms placed them on the weapon on the waist.Su Zimo smiled and sat on the seat opposite Chu Liang.\u201cWho told you to sit down!\u201dChu Liang hollered. Bang! He slammed his hands on the table.Clang!One after another, the surrounding diners rose from their seats, unsheathing their weapons.Su Zimo\u2019s expression was unchanged. Without looking sideways, he did not seemed bothered as he took Chu Liang\u2019s wine jar and poured himself a cup of wine.The two middle-aged men opposite him looked grave and solemn. They moved towards the middle, blocking Chu Liang behind them.Su Zimo had not made any moves and did not even reveal any trace of murderous aura. Yet, the two middle-aged men felt uneasy and had chills running up their spines.\u201cThe two of you are Perfected Connate Experts, right?\u201dSu Zimo lifted the wine cup and asked casually.\u201cSo what if we are?\u201d One of them responded.\u201cThe two of you\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo raised his head and drained the strong wine in his cup. He then shook his head. He continued to say, \u201cWon\u2019t be able to protect him.\u201dThe moment he put down the wine cup, Su Zimo made his move.Snap!The wine cup dropped on the table top. The fall was neither hard nor soft but the entire table suddenly split open!Su Zimo closed in and flipped his palms, enshrouding the top of heads of the two Perfected Connate Experts.His moves were sudden and he attacked two people at the same time!The two middle-aged men were terrified.The aura of Su Zimo\u2019s palm strike was powerful and suffocating. They could even smell a gust of bloody stench at the wave of his palm.In the blink of an eye, the graceful scholar had transformed into a man-eating beast!The two men unsheathed their weapons immediately to block the attack.Swoosh!There was a deafening and crisp sound.Two extremely sharp weapons had actually been slammed to pieces by Su Zimo\u2019s palm. They were scattered on the ground.Bang! Bang!Su Zimo moved forward and kicked both his legs casually. The two Connate Experts were hurled outside. Horror filled their eyes. Their chests were crushed and they were vomiting fresh blood. They were almost dead.In comparison to the spirit beasts in Cang Lang Mountain Range, the close combat techniques of the two men before him were really too poor.If Su Zimo were to use all of his strength, the two of them including their weapons would be crushed instantly with the pressure of this palm!Chu Liang was so scared that his face was drained of all colors.Never did he expect that the two Connate Experts that he relied on most would turn invalid in the blink of an eye!Furthermore, Su Zimo was already nearing him. Su Zimo grabbed his neck and lifted him up in the air.It was too fast!When Chu Liang landed in Su Zimo\u2019s hands, the surrounding diners had not even recovered from their shock.No matter how much they wanted to dash forward, they were fearful of the consequences and full of reservations.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d\u201cRelease my family\u2019s young master!\u201dA loud and stern voice rang from the surrounding. Su Zimo did not seem to have heard it. He just looked at Chu Liang with an imperceptible smile on his face. \u201cI heard that you want to break both of my legs?\u201d\u201cEe.. \u201dChu Liang\u2019s neck was strangled. His face turned purplish blue as he let out a weird sound from his mouth.Su Zimo\u2019s gaze gradually turned cold. He swung his legs.Pa! Pa!Sounds of bones cracking could be heard coming from Chu Liang\u2019s knees. They had been crushed by Su Zimo\u2019s kick in that instant.Chu Liang was in so much pain that beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. His entire body was shivering but he could not bring himself to say a word.\u201cWho told you to come?\u201d Su Zimo pressed him.Chu Liang could not catch his breath. He rolled his eyes and looked like he was going to faint at any point in time.At this very moment, a loud shout could be heard from outside the door.\u201cStop!\u201dA man clad in armor with a firm and resolute face was standing at the entrance of the inn. He was leading numerous guards. He dashed in with large and vigorous slides. This man was none other than Cao Gang, one of the Five Wolf Guards of Cang Lang City.\u201cFighting is forbidden in the city. Su Zimo, quickly release that man!\u201d Cao Gang stepped forward and hollered.A the same time. Cao Gang also moved forward two steps and whispered into Su Zimo\u2019s ears. \u201cSecond Young Master Su, the City Lord would like to meet you.\u201dSu Zimo narrowed both his eyes. A thought flashed in his mind and he vaguely understood what was happening.Su Zimo waved his hands and flung Chu Liang aside nonchalantly.\u201cBring criminal Su Zimo back to the City Lord!\u201dCao Gang shouted again. Numerous guards behind him moved forward and surrounded Su Zimo. Yet, no one cuffed him up.Su Zimo was expressionless but he sneered in his heart. He followed Cao Gang and the group and left the inn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - Heard about the SecretPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosThis was the first meeting between Su Zimo and the City Lord of Cang Lang City.It was very difficult to read the City Lord\u2019s mind just by looking into his eyes. He was expressionless and seemingly very deep and scheming.Luo Tianwu was also sizing up Su Zimo at the same time.His first impression of Su Zimo was a cultured and polite man; no different from other scholars.If he had not known in advance the many deeds of Su Zimo in Ping Yang Town, it was very hard for Luo Tianwu to imagine that such a weak and frail-looking scholar could actually subdue the two big family clans!Immediately after, he sensed that Su Zimo was mysterious and unfathomable!The gazes of both parties collided in mid air. Very soon after, Luo Tianwu revealed a smile first. He said in a loud and clear voice, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard about the famous Second Young Master Su. We finally meet today. Please have a seat.\u201dFrom the side, a slouching old servant dressed in a gray robe walked over. Gray-haired, he had a gaunt face and cloudy eyes. He carried a chair and put it carefully in front of Su Zimo.Su Zimo\u2019s gaze seemed casual as it swept across the old servant. He did not decline and took the seat immediately.Luo Tianwu was very polite to him. However, there was more to this case and it became more evident that this meeting was not so simple.There must be something going on when things occur out of the ordinary.What was the status, power and prestige of a City Lord?Luo Tianwu had never invited Su Zimo when the latter attained scholarly honors previously, much less his inferior status currently.The gray-robed old servant stood beside Su Zimo and filled a cup of tea for Su Zimo respectfully.Su Zimo\u2019s thoughts were deep as he cast a profound gaze at the gray-robed old servant. With an imperceptible smile, he said, \u201cYou served me tea. This must have been hard on you.\u201dThe gray-robed old servant paused for a moment. He placed the teapot on the table without any expression. Thereafter, he retreated to stand behind Luo Tianwu and did not utter a word.Upon hearing this, a beam of light flashed across Luo Tianwu\u2019s eyes but disappeared after a moment.Su Zimo\u2019s words seemed unintentional but others were not sure of the implied meaning.He could be mocking himself for his inferior status or pitying the gray-robed old servant for his old age.Of course, there was another possibility. This lad had already seen through the Qi Refinement Warrior identity of this old servant dressed in shabby and gray clothes!\u201cThis fellow\u2026 is not easy to deal with.\u201dLuo Tianwu furrowed his brows secretly.The gray-robed old servant had hid himself very well. Yet, he could not deceive the spirit perception that Su Zimo had attained via his near death experiences.Without a word, Su Zimo raised his teacup and sipped tea in a leisurely manner.Luo Tianwu was silent too. His fingertips were knocking on the table neither lightly nor hard.About eight minutes passed\u2026The pin-drop silence in the room was frightening. Only sounds of fingertips knocking on the table were resonating. The atmosphere was stifling.The smile on Luo Tianwu\u2019s face had already disappeared.In such a circumstance, ordinary people would not be able to withstand the pressure. They would have long spoken up to ease the atmosphere. However, right from the beginning, Su Zimo\u2019s expression did not change the slightest bit. His gaze was as calm as an old monk who was meditating.\u201cThis lad is only 18 years old and he has such a calm and mature temperament. It is very tricky to deal with him!\u201dLuo Tianwu muttered in his heart. He was already feeling a little restless.In actual fact, this was a tactic of psychological pressure. Whoever could not endure the situation and spoke would inevitably be on the back foot.Luo Tianwu had initially wanted to subdue Su Zimo in the first instance. However, he did not expect to hit him on the wrong spot. He felt very upset.\u201cIsn\u2019t Second Young Master Su curious about why I invited you today?\u201d Luo Tianwu asked smilingly.Su Zimo put down his teacup in a leisurely manner and glanced sideways at Luo Tianwu. He said calmly, \u201cMay I ask City Lord to give me an explicit reason.\u201d\u201cThe two young masters of the Su family are both cream of the crop. Young Master Su\u2019s patience and endurance, and Second Young Master Su hiding your light under a bushel\u2026 The Five Wolf Guards under my wings and me admire you guys greatly.\u201d Luo Tianwu praised.Su Zimo frowned slightly and said, \u201cCity Lord, you don\u2019t need to probe further. Please come straight to the point.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re straightforward! I admire people like Second Young Master Su.\u201dLuo Tianwu gave a slight smile. \u201cYour older brother has failed to assassinate the King of Yan. He is severely injured and bedridden now. I know that Second Young Master Su\u2019s heart must be filled with fury.\u201dUpon hearing this, Su Zimo\u2019s countenance changed.Older brother assassinated the King of Yan? He was injured?Su Zimo had not returned for a year. Hence, he did not know that such a severe matter had happened to the Su family.Why did older brother assassinate the King of Yan?Could the King of Yan be the Su family\u2019s enemy?Observing the change in Su Zimo\u2019s expression, Luo Tianwu was slightly stunned. He asked, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that Second Young Master Su doesn\u2019t know about this?\u201d\u201cI am not aware.\u201d Su Zimo shook his head and endured the urge to rush back to Ping Yang Town.Luo Tianwu felt that he had regained some victory with this. He revealed a slight smile and said, \u201cActually, I still admire and respect Su Mu, Lord Wuding, the most. How powerful and prestigious were the black armored cavalry under his wings then? Which of the surrounding states doesn\u2019t know the famous Su Mu? It is sheer pity\u2026 \u201dSu Mu!Upon hearing this name, for some unknown reason, Su Zimo seemingly felt pangs of pain in his heart.Su Zimo had already sensed that this man called Su Mu was very likely his father!He only heard Luo Tianwu continuing with his words, \u201c16 years ago, we heard that Su Mu had been framed and schemed against by villains. The King of Yan gave orders to annihilate his entire family. At that time, I was also wringing my fists in sorrow and pain. I mourned for the loss of an outstanding hero! Fortunately, Lord Wuding\u2019s bloodline is still in existent\u2026 The two young masters of the Su family escaped.\u201dUpon hearing this, Su Zimo already understood in his heart. He had found the answers to many of his doubts.Without a word, Su Zimo\u2019s lanky body rose and headed outside.\u201cWhere is Second Young Master Su going?\u201d Luo Tianwu asked quickly.Su Zimo\u2019s face was solemn. He turned and look at Luo Tianwu. Visible red veins could seen in his eyes. It was extremely frightening!Luo Tianwu was stunned.The gray-robed old man behind him moved a step back instinctively. He slipped his hands into his chest and searched the storage bag inside.In fact, Luo Tianwu did not know that Su Zimo was unaware of the Su family\u2019s background. He did not expect that Su Zimo would react so greatly.Luo Tianwu calmed himself down and took a deep breath. He said in a deep voice, \u201cI know that Second Young Master Su is keen to take revenge. I also wish to seek justice for Lord Wuding. Why don\u2019t we do this? I have spies in the city where the King of Yan lives in. I can try my best to help Second Young Master Su get close to the King of Yan. With Second Young Master Su\u2019s capability, we will definitely be able to execute the King of Yan and avenge Lord Wuding if we join forces!\u201dSu Zimo shut his eyes. After some time, he gradually opened them. The blood color in his eyes slowly faded and his eyes regained brightness and clarity.\u201cThis is a private vendetta of the Su family. Why should I bother the City Lord?\u201d Su Zimo asked.Luo Tianwu smiled and said, \u201cLord Wuding is the person that I admire most in my life\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou can only deceive children with such words.\u201d Before Luo Tianwu could finish his words, Su Zimo interrupted him ruthlessly.Su Zimo\u2019s words were considered a great form of disrespect for the City Lord.However, the smile on Luo Tianwu\u2019s face did not lessen. He continued to say, \u201cSecond Young Master Su is a little angered. I\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who sent Chu Liang to the inn, right?\u201d Su Zimo interrupted Luo Tianwu again and said calmly.Luo Tianwu retracted his smile. There was a flash of murderous intent in his eyes but it disappeared a moment later. He questioned back, \u201cWhat makes Second Young Master Su say that?\u201d\u201cFrom the moment that I made the first move till I subdued Chu Liang, it only took a duration of ten breaths.\u201dSu Zimo pointed to Cao Gang at the side and added, \u201cGuard Cao suddenly dashed in. Ha\u2026 it\u2019s a little too fast. It was as if this had been prearranged.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I only happened to pass by\u2026 \u201d Cao Gang explained hurriedly.Luo Tianwu waved his hands to stop Cao Gang from continuing with his words.It was just a short interaction and Luo Tianwu realized that this kind of small tricks could not deceive the person before him. To force an explanation would only make a joke out of themselves.Su Zimo gave a sneer and turned back. He paused his steps when he reached the doorsteps and said calmly, \u201cIf City Lord Luo is sincere in helping the Su family, I, Su Zimo, will naturally be grateful to you. However, I don\u2019t like to be made use of by others. City Lord Luo\u2026 you better watch your conduct!\u201dHaving finished his words, Su Zimo left without even turning back.When Su Zimo\u2019s figure disappeared from the residence of the City Lord, Luo Tianwu\u2019s expression turned solemn and sinister. There was already a handprint on the sandalwood table beside him!\u201cThis green and young lad\u2026 He actually dared to be so arrogant in front of me!\u201d Luo Tianwu was enraged. He gritted his teeth and scolded.After some time, Luo Tianwu gave a long sigh. He turned and asked, \u201cSir, how do you feel about this lad?\u201dAt this moment, the gray-robed old servant straightened his back. His eyes were clear and bright. There were no signs of the earlier old and fatigued look.When he heard Luo Tianwu\u2019s question, he said in a deep voice, \u201cSecond Young Master Su is not simple. Although he is not a Qi Refinement Warrior, he could see through my identity as a Qi Refinement Warrior with one glance. This lad\u2019s hands are certainly stained with a lot of fresh blood. When he was angered earlier, I could feel trepidation in my heart. He is a very dangerous man!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dLuo Tianwu raised his brows slightly. He asked again, \u201cWhat will happen if you fight with him?\u201dThe gray-robed old servant\u2019s expression was proud. He said, \u201cI am a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior. How can a mortal compete with me?!\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026 \u201dAfter pausing for a while, the gray-robed old servant changed his stance. \u201cGiven this lad\u2019s temperament and ability, he has a high chance of success in assassinating the King of Yan! As to whether he could escape the capital alive\u2026 Haha\u2026 \u201dThe gray-robed old servant smiled but did not speak a word.\u201cI am not concerned whether he can escape the capital where the King of Yan lives at. As long as the King of Yan is dead, the country will become leaderless and there will certainly be chaos. It will be the best time for me to invade the city and declare myself as the king!\u201d Luo Tianwu smiled. Everything was under his control.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even if they did not know any martial arts, they liked to carry a sword with them, as they appeared to be noble and elegant with it.The saber was used by the armies on the battlefield and the ruffians of the pugilistic society. It was totally unlike the aura of the scholar.When choosing his weapons at Sky Treasure Pavilion, Su Zimo did not choose the sword but the saber automatically. He did not know the reason behind his actions as well.Su Zimo finally understood why when he left the mansion of the City Lord. That was because he was no scholar deep down inside.He was the son of the mighty Lord Wuding, that all the dukes were in awe of. He should be galloping on the battlefield, killing countless enemies with his fearless and indomitable spirit, blood staining his robe!Originally, Su Zimo could not understand why he was not the least nervous, scared or frightened when the knife that he held pierced Zhou Dingyun\u2019s throat that night. Instead, he was slightly excited and eager to try.Su Zimo finally understood everything right now.It was in his blood to kill without the slightest hesitation. Although he had spent more than ten years studying, he could not hide his true nature!The words that Luo Tianwu said were like sharp thorns that pierced Su Zimo\u2019s heart. He was in agony at hearing them.His older brother was seriously injured. How was he doing? Was he in a critical state?Was Xiaoning frightened out of her wits at the calamity that befell the Su family?Upon passing by the inn that he stayed temporarily last time, Su Zimo chanced upon the unique mark made by Sky Treasure Pavilion.\u201cCould it be that the two pseudo spirit weapons have been refined?\u201dSu Zimo hesitated slightly before heading to Sky Treasure Pavilion.When he reached the end of the alley, the walls sensed his Sky Treasure Gold Badge. It turned transparent as water instantly, and Su Zimo walked right through it.Upon reaching Sky Treasure Pavilion, Su Zimo did not stop but continued to go upstairs.There were many Qi Refinement Warriors at the main hall. Many of them turned to look at Su Zimo with a searing and examining gaze.The atmosphere in the main hall was strange.There was a detection skill in the cultivation world. Therefore, all the Qi Refinement Warriors present could tell that there was no spirit qi within Su Zimo, yet he was able to reach the second level of Sky Treasure Pavilion.There was only one explanation for that\u2014\u2014Su Zimo had Sky Treasure Badge with him!With the Sky Treasure Badge, one could be given a ten percent discount when making purchases in Sky Treasure Pavilion. This was very tempting!When Su Zimo went to Sky Treasure Pavilion for the first time, he had Yao Xue, a Foundation Establishment Cultivator with him. Therefore, nobody dared to have have any designs on it.But now that it was Su Zimo who had the Sky Treasure Badge, it was tantamount to a three-year-old kid who walked around with a gold brick.He was a mortal, yet he had the Sky Treasure Badge. He must have come from an illustrious family. Although many of the Qi Refinement Warriors were tempted, they gave up the idea of snatching the Sky Treasure Badge, as they did not want to court death.However, there were still exceptions.A man\u2019s wealth was his own ruin by causing another\u2019s greed.There would always be someone who was willing to take the risk in the face of great temptation!A pair of cold eyes trailed after Su Zimo from the corner of the main hall. It followed him all the way to the end of the staircase.Su Zimo had something on his mind, therefore he did not notice the fleeting malicious gaze at the main hall.As soon as Su Zimo reached the second floor, the manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion stood up to welcome him with a big smile on his face. \u201cYoung Master Su is finally here. The two pseudo spirit weapons have been refined. Come and have a look.\u201dThe manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion slapped on his storage bag and one long saber and a longbow floated right in front of Su Zimo. There were twelve sharp arrows as well.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion said, \u201cThe Cold Moon Saber is about three feet long, it has a silver blade, and a thick and sharp razor edge, suitable for slashing and killing. It is mainly made up of rare spiritual items. We have added ten types of hard materials including seven stars gravel and golden light rocks to cast the saber in accordance with your requirements. Although it had no spirit pattern, it can withstand the impact made from middle-grade spirit weapons and it would still be good as ever!\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dSu Zimo nodded, reaching toward the long saber that floated in the air.Just then, there was a look of mockery in the manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion\u2019s eyes.He was waiting for Su Zimo to make a fool of himself.Su Zimo asked that the pseudo spirit weapons to be as heavy as possible. The Cold Moon Saber weighed close to 500 kilograms. Given his Level 9 Weapon Refinement cultivation realm, he could barely handle the spirit weapon with his spirit qi. It was impossible to kill the enemy with such a weapon.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion believed that the moment Su Zimo took the saber, it would crush his feet!However, the manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion was dumbstruck the next moment.Su Zimo took Cold Moon Saber easily in his hands. He even tried a few strokes with it. It was as light as a feather to him. He nodded and said, \u201cThe saber is pretty good. It is just that it is still quite light.\u201dThe manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of monster is this man? He has no spirit qi, but he could handle the weapon that weighed 500 kilograms with his physical strength. The most annoying part is that he finds it too light\u2026\u201d The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion rolled his eyes.\u201cThis is Sanguine Crystal Bow. Take it.\u201d The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion could not be bothered to go into details. He was in no mood to explain to him.The Sanguine Crystal Bow was bloody red and there was a crystal clear luster to it. It was as if blood was flowing in the bow, exuding a strange aura. It weighed as heavy as the Cold Moon Saber.Su Zimo slanted the Sanguine Crystal Bow over his body, while he tied the quiver on his back, putting the twelve sharp arrows into the quiver. He tied the Cold Moon Saber at his waist. He was all ready.\u201cBy the way, Young Master Su, we have found someone suitable regarding your hiring notice. However, the person is somewhat different from your requirements,\u201d the manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion said.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cHe is Song Qi, a Level 7 Qi Refinement Warrior. According to him, if you are willing to pay him with some spirit stones in advance, he could reach Level 8 Qi Condensation. Of course, if you don\u2019t agree, I can say no to his request.\u201dHe did not know how long he had to wait before a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior could take on the assignment. Su Hong was seriously injured, he had no idea of his condition. Now that the Su family had suffered such misfortunes, Su Zimo intended to rush back to Ping Yang Town immediately. He had no time to wait.\u201cTell him to come. I would like to meet him,\u201d Su Zimo said in a deep voice.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion brought someone with him in no time. He was a Qi Refinement Warrior in his forties. He looked handsome and composed.\u201cThis is Young Master Su. You can talk to him regarding your requests.\u201d The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion stood to the side after finishing the introductions.Upon seeing Su Zimo, Song Qi did not look down on him or flatter him. He cupped his fists and said, \u201cYoung Master Su.\u201dSu Zimo asked, \u201cAre you in a hurry to use spirit stones?\u201d\u201cYes. If I have sufficient spirit stones, I will be able to get through Level 8 Qi Condensation.\u201d Song Qi nodded.\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I can\u2019t say for sure. Nobody can tell you the exact timing to break through a realm.\u201d Song Qi was being very frank.Su Zimo had a good first impression of the man. He was silent before he asked, \u201cSince you are lacking spirit stones, why don\u2019t you join a clan?\u201d\u201cI am a pseudo spirit root. No major clans are willing to accept me. Even if they accept me, they will only treat me as a servant.\u201d Song Qi smiled bitterly.A pseudo spirit root was the worst spirit root. It contained the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth. It would absorb a mixture of spirit qi. It was impure and one\u2019s cultivation speed was very slow.There were also spirit roots that only contained one element, for example metal spirit root, wood spirit root and fire spirit root, it was akin to the legendary heaven spirit root. It could take in the purest spirit qi, and its cultivation speed was fast. If one did not encounter any mishaps, one would most likely become a Golden Core!Given that he was a pseudo spirit root, Su Zimo knew that Song Qi must have been through a lot of suffering to be able to reach Level 7 Qi Condensation in his forties.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Come with me to Ping Yang Town. I will give you one thousand spirit stones in advance,\u201d Su Zimo said.\u201cAh!\u201dSong Qi exclaimed. He could not conceal his joy.Song Qi did not expect that Su Zimo would agree to his request. After all, he was not a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior, and he requested his employer to pay him spirit stones in advance. He felt sorry about it.He did not expect that Su Zimo would give him one thousand spirit stones right away!\u201cYoung Master Su, thank you very much. I will do everything possible to protect the Su family!\u201d Song Qi thanked him profusely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He touched it lightly with his fingertips, infusing it with spirit qi, and the flying sword floated in front of the two of them.Song Qi could tell that Su Zimo had no spirit qi. Since he had a bow and saber with him, he must know martial arts. It should not be a problem to get onto the flying sword.Song Qi said, \u201cYoung Master Su, get on the flying sword. Don\u2019t be afraid. I will protect you while on the sword. I won\u2019t let you fall down from the sword. We will reach Ping Yang Town in no time.\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s eyes swept over Song Qi\u2019s flying sword, shaking his head. \u201cLet\u2019s walk, we will see how it goes when we exit the city.\u201dThere was no spirit pattern on Song Qi\u2019s flying sword. It was a pseudo spirit weapon.Su Zimo himself, with the Sanguine Crystal Bow and Cold Moon Saber would weigh an entire ton. Given Song Qi\u2019s Level 7 Qi Condensation realm, he would not be able to carry all of them.Su Zimo did not point out the truth. They walked out of the city with long strides.There were not as many pedestrians outside the city. Su Zimo was about to execute Plow Heaven Stride to get to Ping Yang Town when he noticed something.\u201cMmm, someone is following us?\u201dSu Zimo did not turn back to check, but he could sense it.Su Zimo did not say anything but maintained his usual speed, walking toward Ping Yang Town. Song Qi frowned, not saying anything.In no time, there was the sound of clothes flapping in the wind. The person was moving at a very fast speed!Cultivator?Song Qi was alarmed. He placed his hands on the storage bag as he turned to check.Not far away was a cultivator dressed in a black Taoist robe. He was speeding forward on his flying sword. There was a murderous look in his eyes. Obviously he had evil intentions!Level 8 Qi Condensation!Song Qi let out a low shout, before he pulled Su Zimo to a side. He prayed fervently that the person was only passing by.In the blink of an eye, the black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior stopped in front of them. He leaped down from his flying sword, smiling coldly at Song Qi. \u201cComrade, you had better step aside. Don\u2019t be a busybody. I have an enmity with this man.\u201dSong Qi glanced at Su Zimo, noticing that he had no expression on his face. Perhaps he was in a state of shock or that he did not know that there was danger.Song Qi cupped his fists. \u201cComrade, you must be joking. My friend is a mere mortal. Why would you have any enmity with him?\u201d\u201cBuzz!\u201dThe black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior touched his flying sword lightly. A beam of light shone from the flying sword. The sword\u2019s aura intensified.Inferior-grade spirit weapon!Song Qi had sweaty palms. The other party\u2019s cultivation realm was one level higher than him and he had an inferior-grade spirit weapon. If they engaged in fights, he had no chance of winning.\u201cSince you are dense, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\u201d The black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior said coldly.\u201cYoung Master Su, you should run for your life!\u201dSong Qi hurried to whisper to Su Zimo before he slapped his storage bag and a flying sword landed on his hand.\u201cJee!\u201dSong Qi controlled the flying sword, making the first move so that he could take the other party by surprise.The flying sword turned into beams of lights, speeding toward the black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior. They reached him in no time.\u201cIt was merely a pseudo spirit weapon. How dare you act arrogant in front of me!\u201dThe black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior sneered before he took his time to tap his sword, sending it flying forward, colliding with Song Qi\u2019s flying sword.Sparks were flying everywhere as the swords clashed into each other!Song Qi\u2019s flying sword was not as powerful. It almost flew off from the collision.The Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s body was relatively weak. This posed a danger to them when in fights. If one was not careful, one might be injured by the other party\u2019s spirit weapon, and one would have no chance of surviving.Song Qi seemed to be on the losing end after sparring for a few rounds. He had no way to attack but could only defend himself.Fortunately, Song Qi was composed. He used all his energy to spar with the other party. His flying sword circled him, forming an impenetrable defense.Su Zimo nodded as he watched the scene from the side.Song Qi could have left under such circumstances. After all, he had gotten the one thousand inferior-grade spirit stones. There was no need to put his life at risk for a mere mortal.Even though Song Qi knew that he could not defeat the other party, he did not leave by himself. It proved that he was a man of his words. Su Zimo could be reassured that Song Qi could be left in charge of protecting the Su family.Song Qi and the black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior was still in an intense battle.They were one level apart in terms of cultivation realm and their spirit weapons were of different grades as well.Song Qi\u2019s defenses gradually weakened in no time. The flying sword was not as steady as before. He had used up too much of his spirit qi and he was weakened.Right then, Su Zimo asked, \u201cWhy do you want to kill me?\u201dThe black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior felt that he had the situation under control. He cast a sideways glance at Su Zimo, before saying in a pitiful tone, \u201cI will tell you the reason so that you will know what caused your death. You are just a mortal yet you had the Sky Treasure Badge. This is why you must die!\u201dSong Qi turned to check in the midst of the battle, realizing that Su Zimo was still standing on the same spot. He could not help but be anxious, shouting out to Su Zimo. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave?\u201dSwash!Song Qi was distracted and the other party made use of the chance to cut through his defense with his flying sword. The flying sword was right before him. It was chilling!Song Qi had no time to steer the direction of his flying sword. He panicked and could not be bothered with maintaining his dignity. He had no choice but to roll on the ground, barely escaping from death. He was muddy all over, looking like a terrible sight.Su Zimo smiled but did not say anything.Song Qi was helpless, saying through clenched teeth, \u201cI am not his opponent. Young Master Su, you should leave as soon as possible, or it will be too late!\u201d\u201cNo one will be able to leave today!\u201dThe black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior hollered, and the flying sword sped up, hitting Song Qi\u2019s defense. Sound of metal clashing against one another could be heard.Right then, the two of them who were in a fierce fight heard a long sigh.\u201cYes, you would not be able to leave today\u2026\u201dBoth Song Qi and the black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior were shocked. Before they could figure out what Su Zimo meant by that, they saw a terrifying sight from the corner of their eyes!Su Zimo was standing forty feet apart from them.But Su Zimo reached them within two to three strides. There was a murderous glint in his eyes. He was like a human-devouring beast that had the single intent of killing the person in front of him!Song Qi who was by the side felt a sense of fear, let alone the black-robe Qi Refinement Warrior who had been targeted by Su Zimo.\u201cIt\u2019s not good!\u201dThe black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s heart jumped a beat. He retreated while he maneuvered the flying sword, thinking of changing its direction to kill Su Zimo.However the black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior was too slow and in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes, he had too many weaknesses.Su Zimo had a cold glint in his eyes. He had a backhand grip on Cold Moon Saber, swinging it in front of him.There was a flash of light from the saber, it was blinding.Poof!A large head was hurled off and it was cut neatly at the neck area. Fresh blood splattered everywhere.Song Qi opened his mouth slightly. He was confused. He stared at the scene, dumbstruck, unable to recover himself.Dead.A Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior was dead from one single slash of the saber!By luck? Down on his luck? Careless?\u201cGood saber!\u201dSu Zimo looked at the Cold Moon Saber. It did not have the slightest drop of blood on it. He praised the saber and put it back into its scabbard with a backhand motion.Song Qi could not help but swallow his saliva.What kind of man would be so calm after killing a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior?In Song Qi\u2019s eyes, Su Zimo had turned out to be a mysterious man. He was a different person from the frail scholar that he knew previously.Song Qi could not help but think of the scene just now. The more he thought about it, the more terrifying it was. He broke out in cold sweats thinking of it.He realized to his horror, that if Su Zimo used the saber on him, he would have no way to dodge it!Su Zimo took the storage bag that was tied at the waist of the black-robed Qi Refinement Warrior. He did not take another look before he threw it to Song Qi, \u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cI-I cannot take it.\u201d For some unknown reason, Song Qi seemed to be nervous around Su Zimo.Su Zimo smiled. \u201cKeep it and cultivate to Level 8 Qi Condensation as soon as possible.\u201dWhen Su Zimo smiled, he seemed to look like the frail scholar again. Song Qi relaxed slightly, no longer feeling as stressed, accepting the storage bag from him.Su Zimo continued, \u201cYou can concentrate on maneuvering the flying sword to reach Ping Yang Town as soon as possible.\u201dSong Qi agreed and was about to ask where was Su Zimo going when he realized that he was no longer in the same position. He strode forward, covering twenty feet at one time. His speed was amazing!It was not until now that Song Qi realized that his employer was no simple man\u2026Song Qi hurried to maneuver the sword to keep up with Su Zimo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Zimo had good hearing. From the intermittent sobbing sounds coming from the mansion, he could tell that it was Su Xiaoning.Su Zimo frowned, striding forward, exerting strength in his arms and pushed the door open.The crossbar behind the door broke into pieces.\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201dA dozen black armored cavalrymen dashed to the front door right away. They were seeing red, looking ready to kill. They were stunned at the sight of Su Zimo.\u201cSecond Young Master?\u201dSu Zimo nodded, bringing Song Qi toward the direction where the crying sounds came from.Song Qi swept his gaze over the guards, slightly fearful of them.He could sense the murderous aura of the guards. They had obviously been through a lot on the battlefields to have such a fearsome aura. They were no ordinary pugilistic experts.Many people from the Su family were gathered outside Su Hong\u2019s room. Some of them were standing while some were sitting. Everyone looked solemn and crestfallen. Sorrow and misery hung in the air.\u201cSecond Young Master is back,\u201d Uncle Zheng stood up and said.Su Zimo squinted his eyes as he asked, \u201cHow is brother now?\u201dThere was a look of worry on Uncle Zheng\u2019s face. He shook his head. \u201cWait for a while. Young Master is still unconscious.\u201dSu Zimo swept his gaze over everyone in the Su family, saying in a low voice, \u201cDo you still intend to keep it from me now that things had come to this stage?\u201dEveryone in the Su family looked at each other, giving out a long sigh.\u201cMy father used to be Su Mu, Lord Wuding of the Country of Yan. Is that right?\u201d Su Zimo said softly.Everyone in the Su family looked alarmed. Uncle Zheng was shocked. \u201cSecond Young Master, you\u2026\u201d\u201cLuo Tianwu came to look for me.\u201dUpon hearing his words, Uncle Zheng suddenly saw the light. He sighed before saying, \u201cLuo Tianwu is no good man. He has rapacious designs. He dreams of being the king in troubled times. He sought Young Master, wanting to collaborate with him, but was refused. The Su family and King of Yan may be enemies, but Young Master does not want to implicate the people in the Country of Yan.\u201d\u201cYour father had been on the battlefield all his life. His troops, the black armored cavalry were famed for guarding the frontier, resisting the external enemies. The Country of Yan did not lose a single piece of land in the battles. The general made a vow that he would protect the people of the Country of Yan all his life, so that they would have a place to live, and be spared from the pains of wars. Young Master would continue his father\u2019s mission, therefore he refused to join hands with Luo Tianwu.\u201dSpeaking of this, Uncle Zheng had no wish to keep things from Su Zimo anymore. He continued to say, \u201cOver the years, Young Master would always be on the road. He was in fact gathering the former black armored cavalry under the pretense of selling horses. He was training them while waiting for the opportunity to take revenge.\u201d\u201cHow many people are there now?\u201d\u201cFive thousand!\u201d\u201cWhere can so many people hide? How can they hide from the spies of the countries of Yan and Qi?\u201d Su Zimo frowned.Uncle Zheng replied. \u201cThey have been hiding at a ghostly village near the Country of Yan.\u201dA few decades ago, the entire village was devoured and wiped out by packs of wolves, even fowls and dogs were not spared. There was not a soul to be seen. No one dared to live at the village. In the end, it turned out to be the best cover for them.Su Zimo thought before asking, \u201cUncle Zheng used to hint that the enemies of the Su family are Qi Refinement Warriors. What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cA few decades ago, there were many Qi Refinement Warriors in the capital city of the Country of Yan. They guarded the King of Yan and therefore we had to keep postponing the plan of assassinating King of Yan. Young Master waited patiently for a chance when the spies in the palace sent news a month ago that King of Yan was going hunting at the southern suburb.\u201d\u201cThe black armored cavalry would only be most powerful in wide terrain. The Qi Refinement Warriors would die if they make the slightest mistake when sparring with them.\u201dSu Zimo nodded.Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s had weak bodies. They were no different from normal mortals. If armies went into battles, and there was a storm of arrows, a few Qi Refinement Warriors would not be able to change the outcome. They might even die.Uncle Zheng shook his head and let out a long sigh. \u201cUnfortunately, the assassination this time failed. There were not a few but dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors beside the King of Yan! There was even a cultivation clan as the King of Yan\u2019s support!\u201dSu Zimo was shocked to hear this.In the cultivation world, the clan leader had to at least reach the Foundation Establishment Realm before he could establish a clan.Uncle Zheng continued. \u201cYoung Master was worried that they would attract attention, therefore, he only brought over thousands of black armored cavalry with him and they went into the city in small groups. But they were besieged by dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors at the southern suburbs. They suffered heavy losses and Young Master was heavily wounded, while only a few dozen black armored cavalry survived out of the thousands of them.\u201dSong Qi came forward and whispered. \u201cSecond Young Master Su, I have an essence nourishing pill. It is very common in the cultivation world. It can be used to stabilize the foundation and nourishing the essence. It should be useful to Young Master.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d Su Zimo nodded.Uncle Zheng said in disappointment, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to heal the body, but it\u2019s difficult to heal the heart. The failure this time was too big a blow to Young Master.\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201d Su Zimo frowned. \u201cBrother has strong willpower and determination. Why would he be defeated after one failure?\u201dUncle Zheng smiled forlornly and sighed. \u201cYoung Master knew that if there is a cultivation clan to support King of Yan, there will be no way for the Su family to take revenge. There is no grief so great as despair. I guess\u2026 there is no way to change things.\u201d\u201cYoung Master is awake.\u201d Right then Liu Yu walked out of the room with a grave expression on his face.There was a strong pungent smell of medicine upon reaching the door.Su Zimo turned and looked toward the bed. His brother, Su Hong lay silently on the bed. His injuries were serious and his breathing was getting weaker.\u201cBrother!\u201dSu Xiaoning who stayed vigil beside the bed cried out loud, running into Su Zimo\u2019s embrace, bursting into tears. \u201cOlder Brother is seriously injured. Second Brother, can you think of a solution?\u201dSu Zimo patted Su Xiaoning gently on the back, comforting her with soft whispers. He helped her to the side before he went to check on Su Hong.Su Hong\u2019s hair had turned white. He had just reached thirty years old but he seemed aged. His face was gaunt and yellow and his lips were cracked. He stared blankly at the roof, as if he had lost his soul.His hair turned white overnight. Indeed, there was no grief so great as despair!Su Zimo\u2019s heart ached at the sight of his older brother. There were tears in his eyes.The Su family had been ensnared in a blood feud for years and his brother had to seek justice for the family by himself!For the past 16 years, this man protected his younger brother and sister from harm, for fear that they would suffer any slightest grievances or be hurt. He remained tight-lipped, worried that they would be embroiled in it.This man bore the hatred and feud by himself for 16 years. He could not imagine the kind of life that he led over the years.Had he ever be able to have a good night\u2019s sleep in the past 16 years?How painful and torturous it must be for this man to be living in hatred all the time for 16 years?\u201cBrother\u2026\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s lips quivered as he called for his brother.There was never a moment where this word sounded so depressing as when Su Zimo spoke of it.Su Hong turned his head slowly, resting his blank gaze on Su Zimo\u2019s face for a long while before there was finally some sparkle in his eyes. He moved his stiff lips, forcing a smile on his lips, as he spoke softly, \u201cZimo\u2026 you are back.\u201dSu Zimo knelt down on the floor, holding Su Hong\u2019s cold hands in his palms. He squeezed his lips tightly together, fighting back the tears in his eyes.\u201cZimo, I won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d Su Hong sighed softly.Su Zimo lost control at his words. Tears trailed down his cheeks, wetting his sleeves.This was the first time that Su Zimo cried in the past 18 years.Su Hong tried to lift his arm to wipe the tears on Su Zimo\u2019s face. But his arm was too weak and it fell back onto the bed in mid-way.\u201cDon\u2019t shed tears, don\u2019t shed tears. The men in the Su family only shed blood but not tears.\u201dSu Zimo lifted his sleeves to wipe his tears, nodding.\u201cZimo, after I die, leave with Xiaoning and the Su family. Go to a place as far away as possible,\u201d Su Hong said.Su Zimo lowered his head, keeping silent. He clenched his fists, his nails digging into his skin, blood oozing out of it.Su Zimo raised his head after a long while, looking calm. \u201cBrother, have a good rest. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201dThere was something else that Su Zimo kept to himself.He would take revenge for the Su family!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Su family could leave for a faraway place. The world is huge, we will have a place to go.\u201d\u201cUncle Zheng, you have been worrying too much. I am not thinking of assassinating the King of Yan.\u201d Su Zimo shook his head, he did not seem like he was lying.Uncle Zheng nodded, not totally believing him. \u201cI intend to move to the ghostly village to stay low for the time being. There are after all still five thousand black armored cavalry over there. It will be safer. Second Young Master, you should come with us.\u201d\u201cI have some matters to attend to. I will go to the ghostly village to look for you later.\u201dSu Zimo changed the topic, pointing to Song Qi at the side. \u201cThis is Mr. Song Qi. He is here to protect the Su family. If there\u2019s anything, you can discuss with him.\u201dUncle Zheng did not think too much into it. He thought that Song Qi was a friend from the pugilistic society that Su Zimo knew.Su Zimo turned to leave. He had reached the door of the mansion when Song Qi caught up with him.\u201cYoung Master Su, are you thinking of going to the city where the King of Yan lives?\u201d Song Qi could vaguely sense the murderous intent of Su Zimo, therefore he asked of his intention.Su Zimo kept on walking and he remained silent.Song Qi caught up with him again, saying in a deep voice, \u201cYoung Master Su, I know that you have the ability to kill Qi Refinement Warriors and you are very powerful in close proximity fights. However, that is only for one to one fight. You will not be able to reach the Qi Refinement Warriors when you are surrounded by the huge army. You won\u2019t have any chance!\u201d\u201cEven if you manage to kill King of Yan, will you be able to escape from the closely guarded city where the King of Yan lives in?\u201d\u201cThere are the city army, the elite Imperial Army, the siege crossbows and various killing devices, as well as the attack by the Qi Refinement Warriors. There is no way for Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors to assassinate the king of a country, let alone you. There is no chance of survival!\u201d\u201cAll right!\u201d Su Zimo turned abruptly, his face gloomy.Song Qi was startled.Su Zimo was expressionless. \u201cYour mission is to protect the Su family. Don\u2019t worry about me!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dSong Qi was about to persuade him further but Su Zimo waved his hands to stop him. \u201cI will leave my brother in your hands. I hope that you will be able to nurse him back to health. As for his concern deep down inside of him, leave it to me. I will resolve it for him.\u201dWith that, Su Zimo executed Plow Heaven Stride and disappeared out of sight in the blink of an eye.There was only a single way to resolve Su Hong\u2019s concern, and it was King of Yan\u2019s head!Su Zimo hurried along the streets in Ping Yang Town. There was nothing but coldness in his eyes. He could feel a burning rage inside of him. It was flaming.He could only douse the flames with the fresh blood of his enemy!Su Zimo reached his mansion in no time. He pushed the door open and walked straight to the cultivation field.Die Yue was still lazing around on the green stone in the cultivation field. She had an indifferent expression on her face as she cast a glance at Su Zimo.It had been a year since he last saw Die Yue. Nothing seemed to have changed about her. She still looked very beautiful. It was as if she had not aged at all in the past one year.Su Zimo had thought of all kinds of scenes where he met up with Die Yue after one year. But\u2026 he had not expected that it would be like this.\u201cI am leaving,\u201d Su Zimo lowered his head, speaking softly. He dared not look at Die Yue.\u201cOh?\u201d Die Yue raised her eyebrows slightly.\u201cNow that I leave this time, I might\u2026 not be able to come back.\u201d\u201cCourting death?\u201d\u201cSort of.\u201dSince Su Zimo wanted to enter the capital and kill the King of the country, he had to face not a man, but an entire country, as well as the multiple Qi Refinement Warriors and a cultivation clan.It was the cultivation clan that had Foundation Establishment Cultivators with them!Su Zimo did not dream of coming back alive from his trip to the Country of Yan.This might be the last farewell for the two of them.Die Yue looked at Su Zimo, there was a tenderness in her eyes. \u201cEven though you know you are courting death, you are going to go anyway?\u201dSu Zimo remained silent.Die Yue continued. \u201cActually, you have other better options. You can choose to take it lying down and continue to cultivate until you are strong enough.\u201dScenes seemed to flash in Su Zimo\u2019s mind. It was as if it was 16 years ago.He saw how his parents died a terrible death under the saber.He saw how the Su family was massacred, and the river turned into blood, the corpses piled into a mountain.He saw how his older brother protected he and Xiaoning, and escaped from the city. He suffered a slash at his face and it went unnoticed even though it was covered with blood.In the end, Su Zimo\u2019s gaze rested on his brother\u2019s white hair, his gaunt and yellow face, and his blank eyes.\u201cWhy do I cultivate?\u201dSu Zimo blurted out all of a sudden, as if asking Die Yue, but he seemed to be muttering to himself as well.\u201cI cultivate not to take things lying down. If I want to do so, I would have knelt down at Perfected Cang Lang\u2019s bullying behavior one year ago. If I wanted to do so, I would have pleaded for mercy when Zhou Dingyun came to take my life.\u201dThe next moment, Su Zimo suddenly looked up. He could feel the blood surging in his body, his eyes bloody red. He shouted. \u201cSince I feel unjust, I will make sure to seek justice. So what if he is the king of a country? So what if he has a cultivation clan to support him? I will kill to my heart\u2019s content! It is better to do things on a grand and spectacular scale this moment than to take things lying down for the entire life. I cultivate so as to go all out to exact revenge. I cultivate as I believe in an eye for an eye!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dDie Yue nodded.In the one and a half years of cultivation, Die Yue had never praised him. This was the first time that he heard this word coming from Die Yue.\u201cRemember what you said today. It concerns your future and achievements.\u201d Die Yue made another remark which Su Zimo could not understand.There was a demonic glitter in Die Yue\u2019s eyes. Thereafter, there were several sutras in Su Zimo\u2019s mind.This is the Bones Strengthening Sutra, It is taken from the Divine Steed Demon King. The divine steed was headstrong. It had the fastest gallop, it was forceful and resilient, there was a strong momentum and explosive power in its gallop.\u201d\u201cI will impart another three styles to you. Divine Steed Dismemberment, Divine Steed Trampling and Divine Steed Fleeting. You can try to figure it out along the way. If you are able to comprehend it, you might be able to be on par with Level 10 Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors.\u201dDie Yue leaped down from the green stone and began to show him the moves.Su Zimo did not blink at all, he was focused on learning the three styles. He knew that this could be his last hope at killing the King of Yan and returning alive!Die Yue was done with the demonstration of the three styles in no time. She looked toward Su Zimo as she said, \u201cGo along. One word of reminder. Demon cultivators are best at skipping the levels and killing the opponents. Given your capabilities now, although you are not as good as Foundation Establishment Cultivators, if you are able to be in their close proximity, you will still be able to kill them instantly!\u201dSu Zimo nodded.Foundation Establishment Cultivators would release an explosive energy when they maneuvered flying swords. It was far better and much more flexible than Qi Refinement Warriors. They might have other attack and defensive moves that were sufficient to kill Su Zimo.But this did not mean that Foundation Establishment Cultivators had no weaknesses. Although they had stronger bodies than Qi Refinement Warriors, their physical strength was still no match for Su Zimo.If Su Zimo had the opportunity to get close to them, he would still be able to kill them on the spot!It sounded simple, but it was in fact as difficult as reaching the sky.Su Zimo looked at Die Yue, no longer hiding his reluctance to part with her. He smiled lightly and said, \u201cMiss Die, goodbye.\u201dDie Yue turned with her back facing him as she waved to him.Su Zimo took a deep breath and walked out of the cultivation field, looking toward the capital city of the Country of Yan that was far in the distance. He clenched his fists as he said softly, \u201cKing of Yan, wash your neck clean. I am coming!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - At Close Combat, A Man Could Be Even More Powerful Than The Combined Strength of an Entire CountryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosSu Zimo headed north from Ping Yang Town, crossing Cang Lang Mountain Range and entered the territory of the Country of Yan.Su Zimo did not ride a horse along the way.Given his full speed right now, no horse was powerful enough to be able to catch up to him.The weather had turned cold, and early winter had arrived. But Su Zimo was burning hot, white clouds of vapor rising from the top of his head.While Su Zimo hurried along the way, he was applying the Bones Strengthening sutra. His legs alternated in an amazing speed. Not even a shadow of his could be seen.Divine Steed Fleeting!This style in the Bones Strengthening section was known for its speed.Plow Heaven Stride was used to train the strength in the legs and every stride came with tremendous force. On the other hand, Divine Steed Fleeting was all about speed. Through mastering the foundation of Body Tempering section and Tendons Transformation section, and by working one\u2019s muscles and shaking one\u2019s tendons, the bones were strengthened through constant beating and hitting.If one achieved initial success in the Bones Strengthening section, once the person exerted strength, there would be cracking crisp sounds of the bones. When the person achieved phenomenal success, all the tendons and bones would give out loud sounds.After cultivating the Bones Strengthening section, one\u2019s physical strength would be significantly increased. By using the Divine Steed style, one could travel 500 kilometers a day, and 400 kilometers a night. No other demon could match up to this kind of superb stamina.To travel from Ping Yang Town to the Country of Yan, a Level 10 Perfected Qi Refinement Warrior would need about ten days while travelling day and night without rest.After mastering Divine Steed Fleeting, Su Zimo was able to reach the Country of Yan on the eighth day.Along the way, Su Zimo walked at full speed, as swift as the wind, constantly using the breathing and expiration method of Bones Strengthening section, never stopping for one second.This was all thanks to the Scarlet Flame Fruit that sealed the huge source of essence in his body. This was why Su Zimo was able to keep cultivating.Su Zimo carried the Sanguine Crystal Bow on his back and the Cold Moon Saber around his waist, and was travel-worn when he arrived at the capital city of the Country of Yan.He had yet to enter the city but he could tell that the city was tightly guarded. There were dozens of armored guards standing on the two sides of the city gate, checking the pedestrians one by one.Su Zimo carried a casual expression and walked up to the city gate.One of the guards stopped Su Zimo, sizing him up. There was mockery in his eyes, as he smiled softly, \u201cYou are just a poor scholar, why did you carry a bow and saber with you? Bluffing people?\u201dSu Zimo was clad in his usual green robe. He had a fair complexion and delicate features. He did not seem like someone who practiced martial arts. That was why the guards found it odd that a scholar carried a bow and saber with him.Su Zimo remained composed, carrying a smile, not making any comments.\u201cHey, that poor guy, take the saber at your waist and let me take a look. Has it been edged? Haha!\u201d Another city guard who was further away joined in the fun as well.There was a change in Su Zimo\u2019s countenance as he slowly reached his hands toward Cold Moon Saber.Su Zimo had no wish to start a fight at the city gate.Once he started the killing spree here, all the city guards would come at him. Qi Refinement Warriors might even be here as well.Even if Su Zimo managed to survive and go all the way to the palace, the King of Yan would have gone into hiding.Just when Su Zimo\u2019s hand rested on the hilt of Cold Moon Saber, the commander of the guards who stood by the side saw the scene and laughed while he lamented his troops. \u201cDamn, you guys only know how to bully a scholar. Hey, scholar, you can ignore them and enter the city.\u201dSu Zimo relaxed slightly and nodded toward the man, before he entered the city.Su Zimo located Sky Treasure Pavilion and went to the second level. He intended to deposit Sanguine Crystal Bow and Cold Moon Saber at this place for the time being.These two weapons were too eye-catching. It was impossible for him to bring them into the palace.With the Sky Treasure Badge, Su Zimo was able to deposit items for free. The manager of the Sky Treasure Pavilion at the Country of Yan gave a soft sigh when Su Zimo took out his Sky Treasure Badge. He smiled as he asked, \u201cYoung Master, can I take a look at your badge?\u201dSu Zimo handed his Sky Treasure Gold Badge over. There was an odd look on the manager\u2019s face when he looked at the badge.\u201cWhy, is anything wrong?\u201d Su Zimo frowned.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion immediately shook his head, smiling as brightly as before, handing the Sky Treasure Gold Badge back. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem. When do you intend to retrieve the items?\u201d\u201cIf everything goes as planned, it will be tomorrow.\u201dWith that, Su Zimo turned to leave Sky Treasure Pavilion.After Su Zimo left, the smile on the manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion vanished and he looked grim.\u201cManager, is the Sky Treasure Gold Badge fake? The person is no Qi Refinement Warrior, yet he has a Sky Treasure Gold Badge. He is indeed suspicious,\u201d One of the workers at Sky Treasure Pavilion asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not fake. It is one hundred percent real.\u201dThe manager shook his head, frowning, deep in his thoughts.\u2026The morning of the next day, the ministers gathered outside the palace, ready to go to the royal court to see the King of Yan.Su Zimo was among one of them.After achieving initial success at Tendons Transformation, Su Zimo was able to shrink and move the muscles on his face, making changes to his facial appearance. But he was unable to change his body shape.If he reached phenomenal success at Tendons Transformation, he would be able to have a complete transformation, changing his body shape.If he could achieve phenomenal success at Bones Strengthening, he would even be able to shrink and expand his bones, changing his height to become a totally different person!Last night, Su Zimo knocked a civil official named Shangguan Yue unconscious, and took his place to attend the morning session today.\u201cBrother Shangguan, I have not seen you for a few days and you seemed to have grown taller.\u201d One man next to him came over to chat with him.Su Zimo remained silent, not reacting to his words.One was bound to have a slip of the tongue if he talked too much. Moreover, Su Zimo might have changed his facial appearance, but he was unable to have the same voice as Shangguan Yue.Seeing that Su Zimo did not reply to him, the person turned around in embarrassment after inviting a snub. He no longer chatted with Su Zimo.\u201cClang!\u201d \u201cClang!\u201d \u201cClang!\u201dThe bell tower rang. All the civil and martial officials tidied their appearance and walked in two rows toward the palace.An old man in his fifties to sixties, with a crown on his head and in a dragon robe sat in the center of the palace, perched high up. His gaze was fiery, looking majestic and awe-inspiring from sitting on the throne for many years.This was the King of Yan!There were four Qi Refinement Warriors in Taoist robes on the two sides of the King of Yan. They looked relaxed, as if they were taking a short rest.The civil and martial officials entered the palace, kneeled before the king and shouted in a loud voice, \u201cAll hail the king!\u201dThis sound echoed in the palace, it was loud and forceful.\u201cHehe, Zhao Qian.\u201dWhile the officials were greeting the king, someone sneered among the crowd. It was particularly jarring!Zhao Qian was the name of the King of Yan!Who dared to call the king by their name in front of the king himself?All the officials were alarmed, looking toward the sound.A man was seen walking out from the crowd. He took off his official\u2019s robe, revealing a green robe inside.\u201cShangguan Yue, you must be crazy. How dare you offend the king!\u201dOne of the martial officials snarled, but he noticed that the facial appearance of the green-robed man was undergoing odd changes. He turned into another person in the blink of an eye!\u201cThis\u2026\u201dAll the officials thought that they were seeing things. They rubbed their eyes and widened their eyes to take a closer look.He was not Shangguan Yue!The four Qi Refinement Warriors who sat next to the King of Yan frowned, sweeping their gaze over Su Zimo. They sneered when they discovered that the man had no spirit qi.To them, changing facial appearances was merely a small trick.The King of Yan remained composed all along. His gaze was swift and fierce. He stared at Su Zimo, speaking in a cold voice. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you recognize me?\u201dSu Zimo smiled and asked, \u201cDo you still remember Su Mu?\u201dPsst!There was a commotion within the officials!This name was a taboo in the Country of Yan. No one dared to speak of it in front of the King of Yan.\u201cMmm?\u201dThe King of Yan squinted his eyes and took a closer look at Su Zimo.The King of Yan raised his head and laughed after a long while. \u201cHahahaha, are you his son?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSu Zimo smiled and nodded. \u201cSu Hong is my older brother.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dThe King of Yan raised his eyebrows and ridiculed him, \u201cWhat is your intention by coming to my palace?\u201dSu Zimo said softly, \u201cI am here to kill you.\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dAll the officials broke out into laughter.To them, Su Zimo, the frail scholar was like an idiot who spoke conceited nonsense.\u201cPoof!\u201dThe King of Yan could not help but laugh as he nodded, \u201cThis is interesting, very interesting.\u201dSu Zimo once told Uncle Zheng that he never thought of assassinating the King of Yan. He was telling the truth.Regardless of whether it was covert killing or assassination, to Su Zimo, it was not enough to appease his rage and the injustice done to his family. That would be letting the King of Yan off too easily.Su Zimo had to kill the King of Yan and he would do it openly, in front of all the officials!Su Zimo wanted the King of Yan and the entire world to know that it was Su Mu\u2019s descendants who killed the King of Yan!It was only through this way could he feel the slightest pleasure and appease his anger and hatred!The King of Yan shook his head, feeling slightly emotional. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the two sons of Su Mu would be vastly different, Su Hong endured it for 16 years and planned the assassination for years. He only dared to lay an ambush and to assassinate me. How dare you have the impudence to come to my palace and threaten to kill me? How dare you and on what basis!?\u201dThe King of Yan sneered. \u201cTo me, Su Hong is considered as somewhat capable. And you? Hehe, you are merely an ignorant man who is brave, but lacks wisdom and tact!\u201d\u201cIgnorant man?\u201dSu Zimo smiled, raising his head as he asked, \u201cZhao Qian, have you heard of this saying?\u201d\u201cOnce the ignorant man was enraged, he would cause bloodshed within five steps. At close combat, a man could be even more powerful than the combined strength of an entire country!\u201dWith that, there was a bright glitter in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes. He exuded a piercing cold and murderous aura. The temperature of the main hall seemed to drop suddenly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their countenances changed greatly.It was extremely dangerous!Suddenly, this seemingly weak and frail scholar had changed into a different person. The aura that he emanated made the four Qi Refinement Warriors terror-stricken.Such was already the case for the Qi Refinement Warriors, much less the rest of the people in the main hall. Some of the civil officials were so frightened that they dropped to the ground, paralyzed and numb.\u201cBang!\u201dBoth Su Zimo\u2019s feet landed on the floor and gave out a deafening thud. The floor laid with gold bricks split on impact, causing a long and huge crack to appear on it. Below the cracks was like a dark and spooky hell that emitted a cold and sinister aura.The entire palace was shaking violently. Dust fell. The sky and ground were seemingly on the brink of collapse and the atmosphere was absolutely terrifying!If one did not see it with his own eyes, no one dared to believe that the scene before them was caused by one individual.Su Zimo had already disappeared from the earlier spot. His figure dashed ahead like a divine and savage steed. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the King of Yan.Fast. It was too fast!The earlier spot that Su Zimo stood was at least ten feet away from the King of Yan. However, everyone only felt their eyes blur for a moment before Su Zimo appeared just one elbow away from the King of Yan.At this moment, the four Qi Refinement Warriors beside the King of Yan had just searched out their spirit weapons from their storage bags.The reaction time of the two sides were on completely different levels!It was not until this moment that everyone in the main hall finally understood Su Zimo\u2019s earlier words.Although he was ten feet away from the King of Yan. To Su Zimo, that was only considered an elbow\u2019s length.At such a close range, one would not be able to beat an ordinary man even when he had the aid of the entire country!\u201cY-you\u2026. what are you doing?!\u201dThe King of Yan was so frightened that his liver and gall were almost splitting. Scared out of his wits, his eyes were filled with horror and he backed off instinctively.Su Zimo\u2019s expression was chilling and cold. He conveniently hurled off the crown on the King of Yan\u2019s head. The latter\u2019s hair fell all over his face, making him look unkempt and embarrassed.Su Zimo stepped forward, reached out his palm, grabbed the King of Yan\u2019s hair and lifted him up!\u201cAh!\u201dThe King of Yan screamed when he felt the severe pain coming from his scalp. Beads of sweat could be seen on his forehead and his limbs turned cold.\u201cMortal, how dare you!\u201d\u201cRelease the King of Yan quickly. Otherwise, you will face death for sure!\u201dTwo of the four Qi Refinement Warriors were controlling flying swords. Another one was directing a long saber. The remaining one was controlling a roulette with sharp edges.Out of the four spirit weapons, only the roulette had a spirit pattern and was an inferior-grade spirit weapon. The other three weapons suspended in the air were pseudo spirit weapons. They were aimed at the vital points on Su Zimo\u2019s body and were waiting for an opportune time to strike.Su Zimo did not seemed bothered. He dragged the King of Yan\u2019s hair and took a few steps back. He used his backhand grip to pick up the long saber that was placed horizontally on the rack behind him.Clang!Sounds of sharp blades unsheathing resonated across the main hall. The lingering sounds were so creepy that it sent chills up one\u2019s spine.Su Zimo placed the long saber on the King of Yan\u2019s neck horizontally.The King of Yan could feel the coldness from the sharp blade. Shortly after, he was having goosebumps all over.\u201cMy name is Su Zimo. Remember me.\u201d Su Zimo\u2019s voice rang in his ears. There was not the slightest change in Su Zimo\u2019s emotions. Yet, the King of Yan felt very nervous.\u201cSu Zimo, do you know that The Imperial Army and Royal Guards total over 150,000 people? Coupled with the immortal cultivation clan behind me, you won\u2019t be able to escape even if you can fly!\u201dThe King of Yan was the ruler of a country after all. When his life was at stake, he tried his best to regain his composure, forcefully suppressed his fears and said while gritting his teeth, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I make a deal with you\u2026 \u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dSu Zimo laughed.At the sound of this laughter, the King of Yan\u2019s heart gradually sank to the bottom of the valley.He could sense that Su Zimo was hell bent on killing him!\u201cSwoosh!\u201dAt this very moment, the King of Yan could hear the sounds of weapons moving in the air at lightning speed.\u201cThe Qi Refinement Warrior is taking action!\u201d The King of Yan rejoiced in his heart.As long as the Qi Refinement Warrior could kill Su Zimo with one slash of the sword, he would still have a chance to live.The Qi Refinement Warrior who made the move was standing behind Su Zimo. The distance between the two was too close. He was less than ten feet away.The flying sword stabbed towards the blind spot of Su Zimo\u2019s sight. It approached the back of Su Zimo\u2019s brains like a flash of light at that instant.The eyes of the other three Qi Refinement Warriors lit up.It looked like the flying sword was going to stab the back of Su Zimo\u2019s brains. As if eyes were grown on his back and without turning his head, Su Zimo suddenly swung his arms behind his head and wrapped that flying sword gently, seemingly not using much strength.\u201cMmm?\u201dThe expression of the attacking Qi Refinement Warrior changed. He discovered that he had actually lost control of the flying sword.The Qi Refinement Warrior had wound his own spirit qi around the flying sword to control the weapon. He could direct the sword with his hands for the purpose of attacking or defending.However, how powerful was the Bovine-tongued Saber?Under the wrapping, the spirit qi of the flying sword dissipated instantly.Su Zimo flipped his hand and threw the sword away!Poof!The flying sword pierced through the chest of the Qi Refinement Warrior and drew out a streak of blood. Unhindered, it pierced into the wall of the main hall ruthlessly, the blade trembling nonstop.The entire process seemed slow when narrated but it occurred very quickly.From the moment that the Qi Refinement Warrior took action to the point where the sword pierced through his body, it took less than the moment of a breath!This man\u2019s expression was dazed, his eyes filled with disbelief and losing focus as he landed on the floor with a loud thud.\u201cPsst!\u201dThe remaining three Qi Refinement Warriors gasped and took a few steps back instinctively. They were trying to distance themselves from Su Zimo.If the earlier sword from Su Zimo was thrown towards any of them, none of them could have dodged it.The speed of that sword was completely beyond their response time.\u201cHurry. Go and notify Senior Brother Liu for reinforcements!\u201dOne of the three Qi Refinement Warriors looked terrified. He dashed towards the back of the main hall and disappeared in the blink of an eye.To the King of Yan, these few moments of breath seemed a hundred years long.They had failed!Even the Qi Refinement Warriors failed when they took actions.All this while, the long saber on the neck of the King of Yan had never left him by an inch.Su Zimo lowered his head slightly and whispered into the ears of King of Yan, \u201cZhao Qian, do you know that\u2026 the moment that I stepped into the palace, you were already a dead man. If I say that I will kill you, no one can save you even when you search high and low for a savior.\u201dThere was pin-drop silence in the wide and spacious main hall!Seemingly, everyone had been stunned by an individual\u2019s aura and kept mum out of fear.Su Zimo\u2019s voice was not loud. It was light and calm, as if he was chatting with the King of Yan. However, behind this voice, everyone could feel the murderous intent that made one\u2019s heart shudder!The King of Yan was shivering with fear all over. His teeth clattered loudly nonstop.\u201cZhao Qian, you don\u2019t need to be afraid. It is just one slash. There won\u2019t be any pain.\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s gaze was icy cold. He said word by word, \u201cI will send you on the road to apologize to my parents!\u201dPoof!The large head of the King of Yan had been cut off by Su Zimo in one slash. He was holding it in his hands.Even upon his death, the King of Yan\u2019s eyes were popped out wide and filled with horror. In fact, before the slash, the King of Yan had already died of fear.He had been frightened till death when he was alive!Ta! Ta! Ta!Successive footsteps could be heard coming from outside the palace. The Imperial Army of the Kingdom of Yan had already rushed here.Su Zimo tied the King of Yan\u2019s head on his waist and surveyed the surroundings. Shaking the long saber in his hands and exuding a murderous aura, he said coldly, \u201cThe King of Yan is already dead. Anyone who stops me shall not be spared!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some fainted on the spot with their eyes rolled back, while some fled outside without even turning back.Among the crowd who fled, there was an excited gleam in the eyes of one of the martial officials despite his terrified expression.When this person ran to a corner outside the palace, an ordinary-looking soldier nearby immediately joined him. The person said in a low voice, \u201cQuickly leave the palace and send a pigeon post to City Lord Luo. Tell him that the King of Yan is already dead and the important event can be realized!\u201d\u201cOrder received!\u201dThat soldier quickened his steps and left the palace. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared into the crowd.In the main hall, Su Zimo held the long saber with his right hand. With the King of Yan\u2019s head hung on his waist, he wanted to dash outside but he suddenly heard someone hollering behind him, \u201cWho are you? How dare you come to the palace and behave so atrociously!\u201dSu Zimo looked back.Both Su Zimo and that person who spoke were frozen for a moment.The person who spoke had a gaunt and thin face and he wore a wide and long robe. His left sleeves looked empty. He was a one-armed man.This person was none other than the Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior from Joyful Clan who escaped a narrow death when Su Zimo paralyzed one of his arms in Cang Lang Mountain Range!\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201dThe one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior recognized Su Zimo at one glance. The fearsomeness in his eyes instantly turned into fear and panic.Although the condition of his wounds had already stabilized, he was often awakened by nightmares in recent nights. That wild man in Cang Lang Mountain Range was even more terrifying and savage than spirit beasts. He was like a recurring nightmare that would not go away.Su Zimo laughed. With a sinister stare, he said in a spooky manner, \u201cSo, you are the one!\u201d\u201cAll of you\u2026 stop him. I\u2019m going to send a message to the clan!\u201dThe one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior could sense Su Zimo\u2019s murderous intent. He did not think of resisting at all. After shouting, he actually escaped to the direction where he came from atop his flying sword.The one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior was very clear of Su Zimo\u2019s weakness.If he wanted to escape from Su Zimo\u2019s clutches, he would have to use Sword Kinesis Flight. The ceiling in the palace had a certain height and he was worried that he would not be able to leave Su Zimo\u2019s range of attack.As long as he escaped to the outside to the boundless sky and sea, he could then survive.Su Zimo slid his soles and dashed forward. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of one of the Qi Refinement Warriors. He supinated his hands and gave a punch.Bang!Just as this man drew out his spirit weapon, his head exploded on the impact of Su Zimo\u2019s punch and he died on the spot!After he was enlightened about Divine Steed Fleeting, Su Zimo\u2019s speed increased further and he could close in with even more ease.Once Su Zimo closed in on the Qi Refinement Warrior, it meant that the latter\u2019s death was imminent.\u201cJee!\u201dThe only Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior in the main hall directed the inferior-grade spirit weapon towards Su Zimo. There was a flash of radiance on the roulette spirit weapon.The spirit pattern shone; the power and speed of the spirit weapon increased greatly!Without even looking at it, Su Zimo supinated his hands and slashed with his long saber.Snap!The long saber broke and the roulette\u2019s speed reduced greatly upon the huge and astonishing impact. Su Zimo stretched out his palm and placed it on the roulette gently. Wrap and vibrate. The roulette had already fallen into his hands.Right from the beginning, Su Zimo had never paused. He bumped into the arms of another Qi Refinement Warrior, exerted all his strength and leaned towards him!Bang!This man was flung off instantly. In mid air, his body suddenly exploded and disintegrated. Broken arms and legs were flying around and blood and flesh splattered all over.In a few moments, Su Zimo had broken away from the encirclement of the few Qi Refinement Warrior and dashed towards the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior.The one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior was escaping very quickly. While he was flying on the sword, he was furiously penning down something. It was uncertain what he was writing.The moment the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior escaped out of the palace, he threw the thing in his hands towards the sky.Su Zimo watched carefully. There was a life-like, white paper crane the size of a palm in mid air. It was shining with spirit light. After fluttering its wings a few times, it flew towards a distance and disappeared in the blink of an eye.Su Zimo vaguely guessed that this white paper crane was a talisman of the cultivation world. It was a means of communication.Although he was aware of this, Su Zimo could not stop it.The Sword Kinesis Flight speed of the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior was not as quick as Su Zimo. With the delay, Su Zimo almost caught with him!This man was terrified. He rampantly circulated spirit qi into his flying sword. The flying sword rose and dashed higher up in the sky.\u201cYou were lucky to have escaped the last time. Today, you will stay here!\u201dAt the sight of the Qi Refinement Warrior about to dash into the sky, Su Zimo hollered and threw up the roulette that he had picked up in passing!Oo! Oo!The roulette transformed into a flash of light, broke through the empty sky, giving out intense and terrifying sounds as the winds roared.Although one was in the sky and the other on the ground, they were not too far from each other.The one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior wanted to avoid it but was too late.In that split second, the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior gritted his teeth. Disregarding whether he would fall off, he controlled the flying sword on his feet, wanting to block the roulette that was shooting over.Clang!Sparks flew everywhere as the sword and roulette clashed into each other!The one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s expression suddenly changed. The spirit qi on his flying sword actually dissipated instantly!The flying sword lost control upon the impact of the collision and reversed towards him at an even faster speed!Poof!The entire flying sword pierced into the belly of the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior. That was a Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s lifeline and Sea of Qi.The broken Sea of Qi meant that over ten years of his cultivation from painstaking efforts had gone to waste.The one-armed Qi refinement Warrior fell from the sky and landed heavily on the floor. Dust flew all over and successive sounds of bones breaking could be heard coming from inside his body.Looking ghastly pale and blood foaming from the mouth, the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior saw Su Zimo striding towards him. Endless malice and resentment flashed across his eyes. With a ferocious expression, he laughed crazily and said, \u201cYou are finished! I have just notified the clan. Not long after, Foundation Establishment Cultivators will rush over to slay you! You will come down to keep me company very soon. Hahahaha!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dSu Zimo raised his brows and said, \u201cSo there aren\u2019t any Foundation Establishment Cultivators in the capital then?\u201dThe one-armed Qi Refinement Officer was stunned.\u201cThanks for the information. It looks like I, Su Zimo, am not destined to die yet. Even the capital city of the Country of Yan cannot stop me!\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s expression was cold and aloof. He stepped forward and trampled on the skull of the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior, crushing it. He took this man\u2019s storage bag and put it away in his arms before dashing outside.If there were Foundation Establishment Cultivators in the capital, coupled with other Qi Refinement Officers, city guards and The Imperial Army, it would be very difficult for Su Zimo to leave the capital.This was because there was a huge gap of one realm between the Foundation Establishment Cultivator and Qi Refinement Warrior. This was a great leap in quality, and the strong powers erupted by Foundation Establishment Cultivators was enough to kill Su Zimo.On the other hand, without the Foundation Establishment Cultivators, even Level 10 Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors would be of little threat to Su Zimo.\u201cI have to make my way out as soon as possible!\u201dSu Zimo told himself quietlyIf he were to dawdle too long in the capital, he would eventually land himself in a hard battle when the Foundation Establishment Cultivators from Joyful Clan arrived. It would be hard for him to escape death then.The Imperial Army of the King of Yan formed a massive array, holding spears as they dashed forward fearlessly. At one glance, they were impenetrable.\u201cKill! Kill! Kill!\u201dHundreds and thousands of the Imperial Army hollered angrily together. The sound was deafening. A massive and powerful aura engulfed the entire place, slamming towards Su Zimo as if wanting to drown him.The Imperial Army was absolutely loyal to the King of Yan. They were resolute and determined. Although Su Zimo was so powerful that he could kill Qi Refinement Warriors, The Imperial Army was fearless and did not back off.Every member of the Imperial Army had a gaze that was as sharp as a sword. Carrying a chilling expression, they had strong murderous intent.The congregation of hundreds and thousands of the Imperial Army erupted a powerful and unwavered determination that astonished the minds and hearts!This was the power of a country!Enshrouded by this massive aura and the frightening will power, even Qi Refinement Warriors who came would have long been scared out of their wits and turned cowardly prior to fighting.However, Su Zimo\u2019s expression remained unchanged. Instead, the brilliance in his eyes intensified!Su Zimo took a long and deep breath and circulated the Anaconda Eclipse heart sutra. His chest bulged and lifted, seemingly wanting to devour the sun and moon. Pausing for a moment, he suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cAh!\u201dSu Zimo gave a long yell.A humongous flow of energy surged out of Su Zimo\u2019s mouth. His voice was booming and high-pitch, penetrating gold and cracking stones, and shrouding the shouts of the hundred thousands of the Imperial Army instantly.Many members of the Imperial Army revealed a pained expression. The weapons in their hands dropped and they covered their ears with both hands.In Cang Lang Mountain Range, Su Zimo had personally witnessed a spirit demon roaring loudly and shattering the body of small and weak spirit beasts with that force.Although his yell was not that lethal, it was still astonishing and powerful. How could ordinary people withstand that?\u201cBoom!\u201dSu Zimo took a step out, causing the ground to tremble, black bricks split open and sandstones flew all over.\u201cThe King of Yan is already dead. Who dares to stop me!\u201dAt this moment, it was as if Su Zimo had been possessed by a powerful ancient demon. The murderous aura was stifling, seemingly wanting to destroy the entire world. It subdued the aura of the hundreds and thousands of the Imperial Army troops almost instantly.Many of the soldiers in the Imperial Army turned ghastly pale with dazed expressions. They actually fell to the ground with wobbly legs. The Imperial Army was in chaos. The strong and powerful aura gathered earlier was swept away immediately, revealing faint signs of defeat.At this juncture, Su Zimo laughed loudly. He was looking disdainfully at everyone out of the corner of his eyes. The aura was towering!The ordinary man in the eyes of the King of Yan was repressing the power of a country!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Zimo had not even made any moves to attack. He only dashed around madly in the swarm of soldiers with Plow Heaven Stride. In ten minutes, he had already forced his way out.Bang! Bang! Bang!The areas that Su Zimo had passed through were in great chaos. There were hundreds of thousands of the Imperial Army trying to hold him back. Yet, he was seemingly in a no man\u2019s territory and no one could halt his steps.Su Zimo circulated Body Petrification. The muscles in his entire body tightened until they were as hard as rocks and his defensive ability increased greatly.When the Imperial Army pierced Su Zimo with the golden spears in their hands, the spears would either slip off or break on the spot. They could not hurt Su Zimo at all!Not long after, Su Zimo had already dashed out of the palace.At this moment, Su Zimo sensed great danger in his heart. When he was running, he suddenly made dodging moves and lowered his body like an anaconda slithering close to the ground.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dA cold beam of sword light streaked across the top of Su Zimo\u2019s head.It was a Qi Refinement Warrior!Su Zimo rose. He dashed diagonally towards the direction where the sword came from like a wild bull, hurling off many of the Imperial Army by the side.The Qi Refinement Warrior who was hiding in the crowd saw his flying sword come to nothing. Just as he tried to redirect the flying sword, before he could even recover his senses, he discovered that all of the Imperial Army in front blocking him from view had already fallen to the ground.The blood-drenched Su Zimo had already closed in on him. It was too late for this person to dodge.Bang!Su Zimo casually punched him and the latter was flung away.The eyes of this Qi Refinement Warrior had lost focus. His chest collapsed; his bones shattered and pierced into his lungs. Before his body touched the ground, he had already stopped breathing.With the power erupted from Su Zimo\u2019s body, even if he did not make any moves, the Qi Refinement Warrior would not be able to withstand any one casual punch or kick from him as well.At this moment, the capital was in great chaos.More and more Qi Refinement Warriors gathered as they rushed over from various places across the city. During this time, there were already about ten of them who had taken hostile action against Su Zimo.Initially, these Qi Refinement Warriors hid among the Imperial Army and guards while directing the flying sword to attack Su Zimo.However, after Su Zimo killed a few of them, the remaining Qi Refinement Warriors were feeling scared. They realized that Su Zimo could find them even if they hid in the crowd.The Imperial Army and city guards could not stop Su Zimo at all!One after another, many Qi Refinement Warriors rose into the air, surrounding and attacking Su Zimo.Although this would deplete their spirit qi faster, Su Zimo could not pose a threat to them then.The worst situation had occurred!In such a circumstance whereby dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors constantly attacked him, Su Zimo could still circulate Body Petrification to endure the attacks from the lower-level Qi Refinement Warriors.However, Su Zimo had to dodge the attacks from the Level 9 and Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors when they unsheathed their inferior-grade spirit weapons.The hardest part was that Su Zimo had no way to retaliate.In addition, Su Zimo\u2019s speed would definitely decrease if he were to rely solely on his spirit perception to dodge the attacks of the Qi Refinement Warrior. Coupled with the constant harassment by the Imperial Army and guards surrounding him, Su Zimo could very possibly lose his life in the capital!\u201cEveryone, there is no need to panic. This lad can\u2019t leave the place. As long as we unanimously join forces and detain him in the capital, the Foundation Establishment Cultivators from my Joyful Clan will arrive very soon!\u201dIn mid air, a Perfected Qi Refinement Warrior said loudly.At this very moment, Su Zimo suddenly turned back and smiled at that person. He had a strange look in his eyes.This person\u2019s heart froze. He flew on the flying sword and quickly retreated so that he could distance himself from Su Zimo.Barely anyone had noticed that Su Zimo came all the way to the palace from an inconspicuous corner and not the main gate of the capital.That was where the Sky Treasure Pavilion was located.Su Zimo rushed out of the Imperial Army\u2019s entrapment and headed towards a wall ahead of him.Swoosh!The moment that Su Zimo hit the wall, the wall suddenly transformed into a glistening water curtain and Su Zimo\u2019s figure disappeared from sight.Many members of the Imperial Army were stunned on the spot.Some people did not believe it. They slammed their skulls on it but ended up falling to the ground with broken and bleeding heads.\u201cMmm?\u201dThe Qi Refinement Warrior in the mid air furrowed his brows tightly. Of course, they were aware that the place was the Sky Treasure Pavilion.However, what shocked them was that Su Zimo could enter and leave the Sky Treasure Pavilion as he wished, although he was not a Qi Refinement Warrior. This proved that he had the Sky Treasure Badge!\u201cSenior Brother Li, what should we do?\u201d One of the Qi Refinement Warriors asked in a low voice.The Sky Treasure Pavilion was the largest trading house in the Great Zhou Dynasty and had a superior status. Killing and fighting was banned in the premise. There was once a situation where Foundation Establishment Cultivators stirred up trouble in the Sky Treasure Pavilion and ended up being killed on the spot.There had been rumors in the Great Zhou Dynasty that the Sky Treasure Pavilion\u2019s backing was the monarch of the Great Zhou Dynasty!No matter how gutsy these Qi Refinement Warriors were, they dared not enter the place to catch people.\u201cNo need to worry. This person cannot always hide inside. He will have to come out sooner or later. When the clan elders rush here and communicate with Sky Treasure Pavilion, I don\u2019t believe that Sky Treasure Pavilion will jeopardize their relationship with Joyful Clan for the sake of one mortal.\u201dOn the second floor of the Sky Treasure Pavilion.The manager of the Sky Treasure Pavilion had been startled awake. Blinking his sleepy eyes, he asked the waiting staff beside him, \u201cWhat happened outside? Why is it so chaotic?\u201d\u201cI heard that the King of Yan has been killed and the murderer is on the run.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not caught yet?\u201d\u201cNo. Listening to what the people outside said, he did not seem to be a Qi Refinement Warrior. However, he knows corporal mortification martial arts. He is invulnerable and has very strong close combat ability. Many Qi Refinement Warriors have already died in his hands.\u201d\u201cCould it be him?\u201d The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion muttered and frowned as a figure flashed across his mind.At this very moment, he could hear footsteps coming from the main hall. The speed of the visitor was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, the footsteps had already ascended to the second floor.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion focused his sight.He only saw a young man drenched in blood heading over directly with a bloody head hanging on his waist. That face on the bloody head no doubt belonged to the King of Yan!\u201cI came to collect the Cold Moon Saber and Sanguine Crystal Bow.\u201d The visitor said in a deep voice.The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion trembled all over and sobered up instantly. Swallowing his saliva, he nodded and said, \u201cOkay, I will get them.\u201dAfter a few moments, the manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion brought the Cold Moon Saber and Sky Treasure Pavilion to Su Zimo.These two pseudo spirit weapons were too heavy. The manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion had to use spirit qi to control them and could barely bring them over.\u201cThank you so much.\u201dThe visitor hung the Cold Moon Saber on his waist. Fastening the quiver on his back and holding the Sanguine Crystal Bow with his hands, he turned and left.It was only until the visitor disappeared did the waiting staff at the side heave a long sigh of relief and gradually calmed down.\u201cThis man is very scary. I even have feelings of fear and trepidation when I stand before him.\u201d The waiting staff said. After pausing shortly, he then had a moment of realization before exclaiming in shock, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that he is the one who killed the King of Yan? Who is he? Why did he kill the King of Yan?\u201dThe manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion had a grave expression. After considering for a long time, he searched out a white paper crane from a storage bag. Releasing some spirit qi from his fingertip, he wrote a line of words \u2018The King of Yan is already dead. The group is now leaderless and the capital is in chaos. The murderer is not a Qi Refinement Warrior and he has the third princess\u2019s Sky Treasure Gold Badge. His identity is suspicious\u2026 \u201dAfter writing out the message, the manager of Sky Treasure Pavilion walked to the window and sent off the paper crane in his hands gently.The paper crane fluttered its wings and soared into the sky, disappearing in the blink of an eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you surrender, your Su family may still be pardoned. Otherwise, humph, your Su family will definitely be annihilated!\u201d One of the Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors said worriedly.Within such a short time frame, someone had already told the Qi Refinement Warrior from Joyful Clan about Su Zimo\u2019s background.\u201cYou wish to annihilate the Su family?\u201dSu Zimo sneered. The murderous intent in his eyes intensified as he suddenly drew out three arrows from his quiver and coldly said, \u201cI will exterminate you first!\u201dHe bent the bow and nocked the arrow.The Sanguine Crystal Bow weighed thousands of pounds. Coupled with the huge tendons of the spirit beast anaconda, the power that it could erupt would weigh at least ten thousands of pounds!There were two key points in archery. First, the force. Second, the accuracy.The Sanguine Crystal Bow in Su Zimo\u2019s hands was heavy enough. Although it\u2019s precision was lacking a little, it did not matter in a situation whereby the dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors were gathered at the same place. Su Zimo did not even have to aim. He just had to shoot towards that crowd of people.Swoosh!Bow like a full moon and arrows like shooting stars.Almost simultaneously, three sharp arrows were shot. There was only the sound of them breaking through the air.Poof! Poof! Poof!Sounds of sharp weapons piercing blood and flesh could be heard.Before they could react, three Qi Refinement Warriors were shot by Su Zimo and dropped to the ground.It was too fast!Many Qi Refinement Warriors in the air were caught by surprise. They did not expect that Su Zimo would have a means to deal with them.The expressions of the remaining Qi Refinement Warriors suddenly changed. They hurriedly redirected their flying swords and fled behind Su Zimo to distance themselves from the latter. Terror filled their eyes and fear lingered in their hearts.Given the power and speed of the three arrows, even Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors would not be able to dodge them!At the sight of this, Su Zimo did not hide the contempt in his eyes. He laughed out loud, \u201cWith such capabilities, you still wish to stop me?\u201dSu Zimo strapped the Sanguine Crystal Bow on his back and unsheathed the Cold Moon Saber with a backhand grip. Thereafter, he dashed towards the outside of the capital.With the Cold Moon Saber by his side, Su Zimo was like a tiger with wings.Although the Imperial Army and guards won in numbers, no one could stop Su Zimo\u2019s killing momentum. It was in complete disarray after Su Zimo fought his way through them, leaving behind rows of corpses and blood flowing like rivers.The dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors in mid air had not given up. They followed Su Zimo from afar but the spirit weapons under their control no longer posed any threat to Su Zimo.When a flying sword shot over, Su Zimo no longer dodged them. With a wave of his saber, the flying sword would be hurled off.The Level 9 and Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors could barely control the inferior-grade spirit weapons hit by the Cold Moon Saber.However, the other Qi Refinement Warriors did not have such control.Although the Cold Moon Saber was a pseudo spirit weapon, it was integrated with too many rare spirit items. It\u2019s toughness did not lose out to middle-grade spirit weapons. Complemented with Su Zimo\u2019s strong and powerful body strength, just one slash from it could dissipate all the spirit qi on the flying sword directly.There would be a massive number of casualties if the spirit weapon that lost control were to hit the crowd of the Imperial Army and city guards.Over time, feelings of fear and terror started to spread between the Imperial Army and the city guards.When one person started to retreat, many people would follow suit subconsciously. The initial unwavering determination of the Imperial Army and guards had finally been crushed.Fear was contagious.The dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors lingered in the air. Their expressions ugly and they were filled with hesitation.In actual fact, the moment that Su Zimo picked up the Sanguine Crystal Bow, he was already in complete control of the situation!Many Qi Refinement Warriors wanted to dodge the sharp arrows from Su Zimo and had to distance themselves from him as much as possible.When the distance was greater, the power of the sharp arrows would inevitably reduce. The deviation from the target would also increase tremendously to allow more reaction time for the many Qi Refinement Warriors.But at the same time, with the increase in distance, it also meant that they needed to use more spirit qi to control their flying swords and would not be able to hang on for too long.If they were to go closer to Su Zimo and the latter suddenly turned back and shot an arrow, one of the Qi Refinement Warriors would drop from the air.One had to know that the 20 sharp arrows in Su Zimo\u2019s quiver were also forged by the remaining materials used for the Sanguine Crystal Bow. It was not any different from pseudo spirit weapons.Once they were shot, be it at the vital body point or not, it would cause devastating damage to the body of the Qi Refinement Warrior if the powers contained in the sharp arrow suddenly erupted!If they were shot in the arm, the arm would become paralyzed. If they were shot in the thigh, the thigh would become fractured. If they were shot in the body, the body would explode after the sharp arrow pierced through it!At the sight of Su Zimo on the brink of fighting his way out of the capital, many Qi Refinement Warriors felt extremely helpless. They were torn between advancing or retreating.At the gate of the city, many guards stationed at the site had long closed the gate. Ten monstrous-sized ballistae for defending the city walls were placed in a row at the gate.The ballistae arrows were thicker and longer than the spears in the hands of the guards. The arrow heads were shining with sinister and cold lights, aiming at Su Zimo and ready to be launched at any point in time.Su Zimo\u2019s killing momentum was on the rise. Seeing that the city gate was right in front of him, he did not care about the ballistae. He held the Cold Moon Saber and charged forward!\u201cRelease!\u201dThe leader of the guards standing beside the ballistae lowered his arms and yelled.Swash! Swash! Swash!Ten huge arrows shot out, tearing the air instantly and making terrifying sounds.How powerful was the ballistae arrows?The arrows shot out could even destroy the city walls!However, now, all ten ballistae arrows were only targeting a single living person made of flesh and blood!The ballistae arrows had not been used to attack a city but to kill a human instead. This kind of situation was unprecedented in history. It was also a rare sight in the future.The ballistae arrows traveled at lighting speed and Su Zimo was still charging. In a split second, the ballistae arrows had already appeared in front of Su Zimo.The ten ballistae arrows came together like a huge stone pillar smashing over. The aura was appalling!\u201cHa!\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s eyes shone as he exhaled and yelled while gripping the Cold Moon Saber. Faint sounds of vibration emanated from the bones in his body. His large tendons pulsated and sounds of bowstring vibrations rang. The muscles in his body knotted together, seemingly doubling his body size!\u201cBreak it!\u201dSu Zimo raised his saber and slashed the ten ballistae arrows with all his might.Bang!Accompanied by an earth-shattering sound, sparks flew as the ten ballistae arrows actually broke in half and scattered all over the ground by the Cold Moon Saber in Su Zimo\u2019s hands!Psst!When everyone in the capital witnessed this scene, their pupils instantly contracted into needle heads as they gasped.Even this could not hurt him?How could this be the power of a human?Although Su Zimo had blocked the ten ballistae arrows, he had also taken a half-step back due to the impact of this force. He flung his slightly sore arms and grinned at the numerous guards at the city gate. \u201cAll of you are finished!\u201dThe guards at the city gate were so frightened that all colors drained from their faces.The power of the ballistae were great but loading the bow needed ten people to pull the string and three people to carry the arrow over to reload it.During this time, Su Zimo had already dashed before them, not giving them any chance at all.Poof! Poof! Poof!Flashes of blood appeared consecutively. No one could stop the powers of Su Zimo\u2019s slash!What Postnatal Experts, Perfected Connate Expert\u2026 After Su Zimo cultivated The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, these pugilistic experts were as useless as chickens and dogs!This was the power of cultivation!Once he stepped into the cultivation world, Su Zimo did not even need to bother about using conspiracy or endure for 16 years to plot an assassination.Let me tell you openly that I want to kill you, and you can not escape either!Even the tightly-guarded capital with Qi Refinement Warriors could not stop me!In the blink of an eye, one after another, the guards at the city gate were fleeing desperately.Seeing that he had hopes of leaving the city, Su Zimo was instantly invigorated. He could not help lamenting, \u201cWith every ten steps a man is killed, leaving no trails in a thousand miles, left in anguish after the matter, hiding one\u2019s light under a bushel!\u201d\u201cHahahaha, the capital of the Country of Yan is only as such!\u201d Su Zimo\u2019s laughter filled the sky, displaying extreme arrogance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he could not hide the endless terror in his eyes, and the arm holding the saber was trembling slightly, he did not move half a step back!When the Imperial Army and guards dared not step forward, when they were fleeing everywhere, he stood his ground and guarded the city gate. Neither did he once leave or waver.His name was Guo Lian and guarding the city gate was his responsibility.He would not cower as long as he was alive.\u201cCome on, step over my dead body!\u201d Guo Lian glared and shouted hysterically.He was using this kind of method to vent the fears in his heart.Swoosh!A strong stench of blood hit his face. Su Zimo was already in front of him.After getting a clear glimpse of Su Zimo\u2019s face, Guo Lian\u2019s jaws dropped slightly. There was a flash of surprise followed by endless regret in his eyes.Earlier on, Su Zimo was covered in blood in the crowd. Even his face was splashed with many drops of blood. He looked like a slayer that had just stepped out from hell. Hence, Guo Lian could not recognize Su Zimo.It was only when the two faced each other did Guo Lian vaguely recall that he was the one who let this person into the city!That green-robed scholar with delicate features and carrying a bow and saber, who was mocked ruthlessly by his underling\u2026At the same time, Su Zimo also recognized this man.The Cold Moon Saber that had just landed on the top of Guo Lian\u2019s head moved away suddenly. Without halting his steps, Su Zimo brushed shoulders with this man and said softly, \u201cYou are the one who let me into the city. I will spare your life.\u201dHaving encountered a close brush with death, Guo Lian felt drained of energy. He collapsed onto the ground, kneeling, panting heavily and drenched in his own sweat.Guo Lian\u2019s mind were resonating with Su Zimo\u2019s words. He could not help muttering softly, \u201cIf I had not let him enter the city, given his powers, could he not fight his way in? Perhaps this is karma?\u201dGuo Lian could not resist the urge to look back. In the next moment, an even more appalling and terrifying matter happened.\u201cBoom!\u201dA deafening noise.The tall, wide and sturdy gate of the city had actually fallen apart under the impact of Su Zimo\u2019s collision!Su Zimo left the capital like a ghost, his feet barely touching the ground. In the blink of an eye, the capital of the Country of Yan was far behind him.Dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors from Joyful Clan followed chased him out of the capital. Looking at the diminishing view of Su Zimo, they did not choose to pursue him any further.On the one hand, they had almost used up all of their spirit qi when they fought with Su Zimo in the air earlier.On the other, these Qi Refinement Warriors could tell that their speed was no match for Su Zimo even if they were in their best condition.\u201cHow exactly did this person train his body till this extent?\u201d Someone could not help asking. The shock and terror in his eyes had not gone away.A person beside him said, \u201cI heard from the clan master that some top clans have geniuses with heaven spirit root who can cultivate at a faster rate. Coupled with sufficient resources from the clan, before Core Formation, they would integrate spirit qi into their body to temper their flesh, blood and veins, refining both qi and body simultaneously. However, this person is clearly not a Qi Refinement Warrior.\u201d\u201cThe body of that kind of cultivator is indeed stronger than us but they are far from reaching this stage. The body of this person is even more terrifying than spirit beasts!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t feel discouraged. When the clan masters rush over, we will kill him together! I just found out that the Su family has been hiding in Ping Yang Town all these years. They are all mortals and can\u2019t run too far away.\u201d\u201cYes, when the time comes, we will annihilate the entire Su family not even sparing the fowls and dogs to vent all our hatred!\u201d\u2026On the seventh day of the King of Yan\u2019s death.In Cang Lang City, a pigeon carrying a message fluttered its wings and flew into the residence of the City Lord.It took about seven days to send a pigeon from the capital of Country of Yan to Cang Lang City.Soon after, an order was passed down from the residence of the City Lord. \u201cPass down orders to the entire army. Prepare to attack the Country of Yan!\u201dLuo Tianwu wore a golden armor with a long saber hung on his waist. He strode out of the residence of the City Lord in a dignified manner, as if he was the ruler of a country. Looking far in the direction of the Country of Yan, he could not help smiling, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Su Zimo to really kill the King of Yan. This is heaven\u2019s will! Heaven wants me, Luo Tianwu, to become the king. This is where the events are leading to. Who else can stop me!\u201d\u201cCongratulations, your highness.\u201dThe gray-robed old elder standing beside Luo Tianwu said smilingly, \u201cSu Zimo is quite smart but he still fell into your highness\u2019s scheme of killing with a borrowed knife. After murdering the King of Yan, he will also die in the capital of the Country of Yan.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dLuo Tianwu laughed complacently, \u201cThis is an open scheme. Su Zimo knows that I am making use of him but he still fell into the trap and helped me kill the King of Yan. Su Zimo, haha. He is just an ordinary man without any major use. He has wasted his time studying for more than 10 years.\u201d\u201cMister, don\u2019t worry. When I become the king, I will definitely confer you the title of the country\u2019s advisor.\u201d Luo Tianwu said in a deep voice.The gray-robed elder bowed slightly, cupped his fists and said, \u201cThank you, your highness.\u201dLuo Tianwu waved his arms and said loudly, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Follow me into battle. Success and dominance is happening right at this moment!\u201dLuo Tianwu had long waited for this day. The troops in the city sharpened their swords and were long prepared. Within 15 minutes, 50,000 soldiers and horses led respectively by the Five Wolf Guards of Cang Lang City had already gathered.The army left the city, detoured Cang Lang Mountain Range and entered the borders of the Country of Yan. The nearest city to the borders was Jian An City in the Country of Yan.\u2026In a deserted village not far away from Jian An City, not a soul could be seen. This place was termed as the ghost village.The Su family had moved to this place more than ten days ago. None of them were residing in Ping Yang Town anymore.These days, using elixirs refined by Song Qi to nurse his health, Su Hong\u2019s body gradually showed signs of improvement. He had recovered much.However, as predicted by Uncle Zheng, it was easy to heal the body but difficult to heal the heart.Su Hong was still bedridden and had lost his appetite for food. His eyes were empty and soulless. Each time he thought about the Su family losing all hopes of avenging the blood feud, his heart ached unbearably.Uncle Zheng and the rest were also at a loss over what to do.Looking at Su Hong recovering physically but becoming more dispirited as the days passed, everyone in the Su family mourned and sighed.On this day, Liu Yu, the head guard of the Su family suddenly rushed into the courtyard with a complicated expression mixed with sadness and joy. He said loudly, \u201cMr Zheng, something serious has happened!\u201d\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d Uncle Zheng\u2019s heart sank.Liu Yu said, \u201cLuo Tianwu and his Five Wolf Guards are leading an army of 50,000 to attack Jian An City. They have already arrived at the foot of the city gate!\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dUncle Zheng drew his brows together and said in puzzlement, \u201cLuo Tianwu has been plotting for a long time. But why did he suddenly send out his troops? There must be some reason. Otherwise, he won\u2019t act rashly.\u201d\u201cMister\u2019s conjecture is correct.\u201dLiu Yu nodded and said, \u201cAccording to the information from the spy, Luo Tianwu claimed that the King of Yan is already dead and the Country of Yan is in great chaos. It is just that the news has not spread outside the capital. As long as the City Lord of Jian An City surrenders, he will be conferred the post of Premier or other additional titles.\u201dUncle Zheng frowned, carrying a grave expression. He pondered deeply and said, \u201cSince Luo Tianwu has already sent his troops, this news is very likely true! However, the King of Yan had the protection of dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors. How did he die so easily? Who killed the King of Yan?\u201dSuddenly, Uncle Zheng seemed to have thought of something. He exclaimed in shock, \u201cSecond young master! Where did second young master go recently? Did anyone see him?\u201dLiu Yu shook his head and said, \u201cSecond young master is indeed very powerful but I don\u2019t think he will be able to sneak into the capital and kill the King of Yan before the eyes of dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors?\u201dUncle Zheng let out a long sigh. He gradually calmed down before nodding and saying, \u201cThat\u2019s also true.\u201dAfter hesitating for a moment, Song Qi, who was beside them, could not help saying, \u201cBut, I am afraid that your family\u2019s second young master might really be the one who killed the King of Yan!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After staring at Song Qi for a long time, they then said slowly, \u201cThis\u2026 how is this possible?\u201d\u201cPardon me for being frank. Although both of you are members of the Su family, I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t seem to know much about your family\u2019s second young master.\u201dSong Qi said, \u201cSecond Young Master Su is not a Qi Refinement Warrior. But he has the ability to kill them. I\u2019m a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior but I dare not say that I will win a fight against Second Young Master Su.\u201dDuring the past ten days, Song Qi had already achieved a breakthrough in the realm and cultivated till Qi Condensation Level 8 using the inferior-grade spirit stones from Su Zimo.\u201cYou\u2019re a Qi Refinement Warrior?\u201d\u201cAnd a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior?\u201d\u201cSecond young master has the ability to kill Qi Refinement Warriors?\u201d\u201cEven a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior dare not be sure about beating second young master in a fight?\u201dA string of doubts emerged, making the Uncle Zheng duo a little dazed and lost in their senses.They had always thought that Song Qi was just a friend from the pugilistic world that Su Zimo knew. They interacted with him for days but did not know that the latter was a Qi Refinement Warrior.Song Qi added, \u201cThe purpose of my trip to the Su family this time is also because of Second Young Master Su. He entrusted me to protect all of you.\u201dThese words surprised the Uncle Zheng duo even more.Second young master actually had the ability to give instructions to Level 8 Qi Refinement Warriors!Uncle Zheng pondered for a while and realized that Song Qi would not sprout nonsense that did not have a basis.All of a sudden, Uncle Zheng\u2019s countenance changed greatly as a thought flashed across his mind. He suddenly asked, \u201cSecond young master killed the King of Yan. Can he still escape from the capital?\u201dSong Qi\u2019s eyes dimmed and he smiled bitterly. He did not reply.Uncle Zheng\u2019s expression turned ugly. He seemed to have aged a lot instantly.He watched Su Zimo grew up and looked upon the latter like his own child.In his heart, the blood feud of the Su family was definitely important but not as much as one-tenth of Su Zimo.\u201cSigh.\u201d Uncle Zheng shut his eyes and gave a long sigh.Liu Yu said resentfully, \u201cIt\u2019s all Luo Tianwu\u2019s fault. If he didn\u2019t tell second young master about what happened 16 years ago, second young master would not have died!\u201dUncle Zheng frowned badly and shook his head. He said, \u201cNews of the King of Yan\u2019s death has not spread here. The City Lord of Jian An City is also not a fool. Will he believe Luo Tianwu\u2019s words? Although Luo Tianwu is leading 50,000 troops and horses for the attack, he may not succeed in taking down Jian An City either.\u201dLiu Yu\u2019s eyes were filled with endless fury. He said coldly, \u201cThat Luo Tianwu is merciless and cruel. He did not forcefully launch an attack. Instead, he gathered the innocent villagers of ten villages near Jian An City and put these villagers at the frontline to shake Jian An City! As long as these villagers retreat, Luo Tianwu would give orders to slaughter them. These villagers are unarmed and have no other way out. They can only run to Jian An City.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Uncle Zheng was stunned.This tactic was extremely vicious.If a hundred thousand villagers were dashing towards Jian An City, it would create a massive force that could not be ignored. As long as the City Lord of Jian An City opened the city gate, the villagers would swarm in like bees. Right on the heels of them were the 50,000 troops of Luo Tianwu. Jian An City would definitely be taken down!If Jian An City refused to open the city gate and chose to look on indifferently, the soldiers on the city wall would have to watch on helplessly as their people of the Country of Yan were being slaughtered. This would result in massive fear and panic in the city and also affect the morale of the army adversely.Moreover, there was a high possibility that some of the villagers at the foot of the city gate were their relatives.The huge battle had not even started and Luo Tianwu had already won half it!However, these innocent people of the Country of Yan were sacrifices behind his victory.Although the Su family had been staying at Ping Yang Town all these years, they had always regarded themselves as a citizen of the Country of Yan. They were born in the Country of Yan and grew up there. They had a great sense of belonging to the country of their origin.Uncle Zheng waved his hands and suddenly said softly, \u201cYou can tell young master about the news of the King of Yan\u2019s death. However, please don\u2019t tell him that Luo Tianwu is driving away the people of the Country of Yan and attacking the city! Given young master\u2019s temperament, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 \u201dAt this moment, the doors to a bedroom situated a short distance away suddenly opened.Uncle Zheng and trio turned to look behind them.Holding onto the side of the door, Su Hong was standing there. His face was still pale and his body weak. However, his pair of eyes was gradually regaining some lustre.\u201cBring me my armor.\u201d Su Hong said softly. His tone was firm and resolute.\u201cYoung master, you\u2026 \u201d Tears welled up in Liu Yu\u2019s eyes. He was choking on his words.The man before him had patiently endured for 16 years for the sake of avenging the Su family\u2019s blood feud. After learning that there were no longer any hopes of revenge, he was almost down-and-out, bedridden and dejected.Nevertheless, when he heard that the people of the Country of Yan were in trouble, he stood up without any hesitation!Although his body was weak and his injuries had not recovered, he did not hesitate the slightest bit.This was because he was the son of Lord Wuding, Su Mu, a descendant of the Su family and the young master of the Su family!\u201cYoung master, your health is not good. How would you have the strength to fight a battle? Pass down your orders. Our 5,000 black armored cavalry will help you to fight this battle!\u201d Liu Yu gritted his teeth and said.Uncle Zheng looked anxious. He said, \u201cSecond young master is unlikely to have survived. Young master, please don\u2019t let anything happen to you. Otherwise, the Su family\u2019s bloodline will be lost!\u201dThere was a flash of deep sorrow in Su Hong\u2019s eyes.He had carefully hidden the feud of the Su family as he did not wish to burden his younger brother. Never did he expect to end up with such an outcome.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201dSu Hong suppressed the grief in his heart and shook his head, \u201cIf Zimo is really the one who killed the King of Yan. I should go and stop Luo Tianwu. This is because if the King of Yan is dead and Jian An City is taken, Zimo will definitely become a sinner of the Country of Yan and leave a bad name for ages. How can I, Su Hong, bear to let this happen?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 \u201d The Uncle Zheng pair wanted to persuade him but was interrupted by Su Hong.\u201cFather once swore that he will protect the people of the Country of Yan for life, let the commoners have a safe and peaceful place protected from the flames of war to live in. Now, the people of the Country of Yan are in trouble. I, Su Hong, would rather die on the battlefield with the horses and corpses than to hide here!\u201dSu Hong took a deep breath, his eyes glistening brightly. He said in a deep voice, \u201cAnyone who attacks the borders of the Country of Yan must be killed! Anyone who slays the people of my Country of Yan must be killed!\u201dAt this moment, Uncle Zheng seemed to have seen Su Mu\u2019s shadow on Su Hong.In a daze, he seemed to have returned to 20 years ago when he followed Su Mu in gaining victories across the battlefields and advancing courageously all the time!Such familiar words, familiar scene, same boldness and same display of one\u2019s prowess. There was nothing to fear!Su Hong raised his voice and said, \u201cWhere is the black armored cavalry!\u201dIt was not sure when, but the 5,000 black armored cavalry had already gathered outside. Each of their gazes were burning like fire and emanating boundless will power to fight the battle.Suddenly, Uncle Zheng\u2019s old eyes teared up. Kneeling down on one knee, he said loudly, \u201cZheng Zhe is willing to follow the general to attack and kill the foreign enemies and protect our Country of Yan and my people!\u201dAll the 5,000 black armored cavalry dismounted from their horses and knelt down on one knee in a coordinated manner. They hollered, \u201cI am willing to follow the general to attack and kill the foreign enemies and protect our Country of Yan and my people!\u201dSu Hong clenched his fists and said loudly, \u201cPrepare the horses and follow me into battle. May the glory of the black armored cavalry return!\u201dWatching this scene, Song Qi\u2019s heart was suddenly full of admiration and respect for this man before him.As a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior, he could look down on all mortals but at this very moment, Song Qi took his hat off to a mortal.He experienced the enthusiasm that he never had before.He experienced the family feud and country hatred that he never had before.He experienced the feelings of deep love for the people and deep love for the land under his feet.At this very moment, Su Hong\u2019s body trembled. He suddenly turned with his back facing everyone and stretched out his palm to cover his lips. Thereafter, he put down his hands, looking normal and without any traces of oddity.However, Song Qi could see it very clearly. In the palm of Su Hong, there was a pool of glaring red blood!Although Su Hong\u2019s body was weak, it was no longer in a severe condition. As such, it was impossible that he would cough out blood.Song Qi was well aware that such a situation would only occur when a person\u2019s heart had ached too much but had no place to vent the pain.Although Su Hong did not express much upon hearing the news of Su Zimo\u2019s death, he had chosen to conceal his sorrows deep in the heart.Previously, Song Qi was hired by Su Zimo to protect the Su family from dangers.However, at this moment, Song Qi really wanted to protect this man from the bottom of his heart!Such a man did not deserve to die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All of them flocked to Jian An City\u2019s gate.Cao Wenxing, the City Lord of Jian An City, stood on top of a defensive tower, watching coldly as the villagers fled for their lives. He waved his hands and shouted his orders. \u201cRelease the arrows!\u201d\u201cLord, they are our people of the Country of Yan!\u201d A deputy general behind Cao Wenxing stepped forward to stop him. He could not bear to kill his own people.\u201cMmm?\u201dCao Wenxing glanced sideways and asked, \u201cIf the inferior commoners rushed here and broke into the city, the 50,000 strong army of Luo Tianwu\u2019s would follow right on their heels. Wei Mingcheng, tell me, who will bear the responsibility for it?! All of us will die if Jian An City falls!\u201d\u201cWhoever dares to question my orders will be punished according to martial law!\u201d Cao Wenxing shot a harsh glance at the deputy general.The deputy general who was named Wei Mingcheng lowered his head. Although he felt indignant, he dared not voice his opinions any further.Cao Wenxing swept his gaze over the soldiers by the city wall as he shouted. \u201cRelease the arrows!\u201dSome of the soldiers clenched their teeth and shut their eyes before releasing the arrows.Swash! Swash! Swash!There was a storm of arrows.The storm of arrows was able to wipe out all the defenseless people of the Country of Yan.In the blink of an eye, hundreds and thousands of villagers collapsed onto the ground after being shot by the arrows. The entire place outside the city was filled with casualties and corpses. It was a heart-wrenching sight.They would die if they take another step forward. But they would die if they retreated as well.The remaining thousands of villagers knelt down outside Jian An City. They kept kowtowing and crying helplessly for rescue. It was heartbreaking.The 50,000 strong army of Cang Lang City were stationed a couple hundred meters outside Jian An City. Luo Tianwu stared coldly at the helpless people of the Country of Yan. He did not feel any sympathy for them.It was these innocent people who were the first to suffer from the war between the two countries.\u201cCity Lord, please open the door, let us go in. My two children are dead on the battlefield. You can\u2019t treat us like this.\u201dCao Wenxing looked indifferent. He was not the least moved.A seven or eight-year-old child was frightened. The child broke out of a woman\u2019s embrace and ran toward the faraway distance. He had only taken a few steps when Luo Tianwu ordered his troops to shoot him down. He dropped onto the ground dead.\u201cAh!\u201dThe woman screamed, rushing madly to Luo Tianwu. She had yet to get close to him and she was shot down by dozens of arrows.The woman fell to the ground, losing focus in her eyes. She stared at the sky above her head, whispering. \u201cHeaven, please takes pity on us, who will save us\u2026\u201dBang! Boom! Boom!Right then, fumes and dust billowed in the wind from not too far away. The ground violently vibrated, there was a thunderous sound of hooves. A large troop of black armored cavalry came galloping ferociously, closing in with a menacing aura.The leader was clad in silver armor, holding an iron spear of the flowing spring. There was a hideous scar on his face. His eyes were sharp and he hollered. \u201cLuo Tianwu, prepare to die!\u201d\u201cRelease the javelins!\u201dThe troops were still far away from each other. The archers were unable to release arrows as it was not within shooting range. Su Hong sat atop his horse pointed forward.The 5,000 black armored cavalry jumped into action simultaneously. It seemed as if they had been through countless training as they moved in unison. They released the long spears that they held. The flying spears seemed like locusts that ravaged the entire area.The 5,000 long spears flashed a cold glitter as they went soaring into the sky, letting off a whining sound. It was an intimidating sight.Most of the black armored cavalry were Postnatal Experts. If they exerted all their strength to throw the spear, the shooting range would be further and more powerful than arrows!The gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s countenance changed. He had to avoid clashing head on with the array of spears. He used his flying sword to protect Luo Tianwu while they retreated.The 50,000 strong troops of Cang Lang City were caught off-guard. Many of the soldiers fell off their horses and corpses were strewn everywhere.The black armored cavalry kept on advancing, not slowing down at all. By the time the Cang Lang City troops recovered their senses, the black armored cavalry had already arrived right in front of them!The arrows that the Cang Lang City troops prepared were rendered useless. Instead, it was a hindrance to them.\u201cChange formation!\u201dSu Hong yelled as he led the troops from the front, with Song Qi right behind him.The 5,000 black armored cavalry took the long sabers from their waists and took the form of an awl. They were on a roll, looking imposing and domineering. The awl-shaped formation helped them to break into the Cang Lang City troops!Bang!The two armies crashed into each other. They fought hand to hand, and blood was spewed everywhere. It was tragic!The 5,000 black armored cavalry created a huge opening in the formation of the 50,000 strong army.The soldiers on the city walls gave a shout of joy at the sight of this scene.Wei Mingcheng was thrilled. He pointed toward the 5,000 black armored cavalry outside the city, speaking in a quivering voice, \u201cThey are the black armored cavalry. They are the black armored cavalry of the Country of Yan!\u201dAll the soldiers in Jian An City were in awe upon hearing that the black armored cavalry were here.To the soldiers who had been guarding the border, the black armored cavalry had a well-known reputation. Under the leadership of Lord Wuding, the black armored cavalry had always been able to defeat the enemy troops with a force inferior in number. They had always been their pride and the pride of Country of Yan.Unfortunately, after the sudden change in circumstances in the capital 16 years ago, the black armored cavalry had disappeared as well.However, their name had been deeply buried in the memories of each and every soldier.\u201cIs it General Su?\u201d\u201cGeneral Su is not dead. He is back with the black armored cavalry!\u201d Some of the soldiers were exhilarated and they wept softly.Wei Mingcheng stepped forward, saying in excitement, \u201cLord, I volunteer to lead a troop to lend support to the black armored cavalry. We will definitely send the enemy away!\u201dCao Wenxing looked at him with cold eyes, speaking in an indifferent tone. \u201cNo!\u201dWei Mingcheng felt as if he was struck by lightning.Cao Wenxing said, \u201cSu Mu revolted against the Country of Yan and he died. The person outside the city is definitely not Su Mu.\u201d\u201cBut they are the black armored cavalry. I wouldn\u2019t be wrong!\u201d\u201cSo what if they are the black armored cavalry? There are only 5,000 of them. How long could they fight against the enemy? By the time Luo Tianwu gets his army under control, the black armored cavalry will be dead meat.\u201d\u201cThe black armored cavalry dominated the battlefields, sweeping up victories wherever they went. Lord, don\u2019t you remember their reputation? This is the pride of the black armored cavalry. General Su had spent all his life on the battlefield, he had never lost a battle!\u201dCao Wenxing was getting impatient. He waved his hands. \u201cWei Mingcheng, it is a meritorious achievement if we managed to guard Jian An City. Now that the two armies are fighting it out outside the city, it is the wisest choice to stand by watching others battle. No matter who wins and who loses, it will be beneficial to Jian An City.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dCao Wenxing suddenly looked back, staring at Wei Mingcheng with a murderous look, interrupting him. \u201cIf you dare to continue with your nonsense and affect the army\u2019s morale, I will not hesitate to kill you!\u201dWei Mingcheng stared at Cao Wenxing in shock, disappointment evident in his eyes.In no time, with the gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s help, Luo Tianwu had stabilized the army and was in a confrontation with the black armored cavalry outside Jian An City.\u201cSu Hong, you must be crazy!\u201dLuo Tianwu shouted in rage. \u201cThe King of Yan feuded with the Su family and was slain by your younger brother. I am taking revenge for you, yet you are stopping me. You have lost your mind!\u201dLuo Tianwu might have plans and ploys, but he had never expected that Su Hong would stop him in this crucial moment.The most troubling thing was that there was a Qi Refinement Warrior with Su Hong.Su Hong sneered. \u201cLuo Tianwu, listen well! The Su family may have a family feud with the King of Yan. But your army raids the land of the Country of Yan, intruding our borders and territory, slaughtering our people, this is national enmity! Family feud and national enmity are different! My father was a general all his life and he had never lost a single battle or lost any of the lands that belonged to the Country of Yan. If I allow you to succeed, I will be too ashamed to face my father!\u201dHis impassioned words resonated deep down with every soldier in Jian An City. They were touched and moved by him.Wei Mingcheng looked towards the back of Cao Wenxing, his gaze hardened. His hand reached slowly toward the long saber at his waist.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dRight then, Cao Wenxing turned around suddenly, discovering that Wei Mingcheng had his hands on the hilt of the saber. He said coldly, \u201cWei Mingcheng, how dare you defy your superiors and have the notion of killing me?\u201d\u201cUnscrupulous official, I disdain to be in your company. I will slay you today!\u201dWei Mingcheng gave a loud shot as he drew his saber and rushed forward.Cao Wenxing sneered as he waved his sleeves and wrapped the oncoming long saber. He flipped his palms, landing a heavy thrust on Wei Mingcheng\u2019s chest.Wei Mingcheng was at the Postnatal realm, he was not the opponent of Cao Wenxing who was at the Connate realm.Wei Mingcheng dropped to the ground, threw up a mouthful of blood, staining his sleeves. He laughed in desperation. \u201cCao Wenxing, you might be able to kill me, but can you kill all the people of Jian An City? Take a look at the soldiers around you. Is there anyone who is willing to work under you and risk their lives for you? You\u2019re a coward!\u201dCao Wenxing looked around him, everyone from the lowest-rank soldier to the deputy general next to him had anger and resistance in their eyes.Cao Wenxing panicked slightly.The Connate Expert might be powerful, but he was unable to defeat all of them. If all of his troops turned against him, he would not be able to survive.Outside the city, Luo Tianwu had a grim expression as he said coldly, \u201cSu Hong, given you only have 5,000 calvary, and you want to fight against my 50,000 elite troops? Our strength is 10 to 1. You don\u2019t have any chance of winning!\u201dRight then, there came a mighty sound from the top of the city tower. It could be heard everywhere on the battlefield.\u201cWhat about if you count me in? Luo Tianwu, what are the chances of winning now?\u201dNo one had any idea on when a man covered in blood appeared on the city tower. He had a head hung at his waist, carrying a bow on his back and a saber with him. It was as if an ancient Heavenly Deity descended from the Heavens. The person looked domineering and majestic. Although he seemed to have gone through hardship, he had a burning gaze that one could not help but avoid!\u2026Author\u2019s Note:The introduction stated that the man was a heroic genius that heaven was jealous of. He was gifted, the best of the best among the geniuses. He could be hailed as a fiend. Right now, Zimo has only begun to reveal his fiendish characteristics, he has yet to show the true terror of a fiend.Let\u2019s talk about the title. In \u201cImmortal Sword God\u201d, the word \u201cimmortal\u201d had a special meaning, so did \u201ceternal\u201d in \u201cEternal Sacred King\u201d. I would not reveal the details here.As the book said, the Great Zhou Dynasty is only a part of the vast continent. Zimo would leave Ping Yang Town very soon and enter the cultivation world. In the vast continent, there are many clans. It is said that there are nine immortal sects, eight demon clans, seven fiend sects, six Buddhist monasteries, five heretical doctrines, four dissident groups\u2026To me, this is a vast immortal and martial arts world, a fantasy in abundance, bizarre and motley, covering everything under the sun!The powerful cultivators have superhuman skills, having the ability to carry the mountain and catch up with the moon, burn the sky and boil the sea, possess the power to summon wind and rain and to pluck the stars using a single hand!The powerful fiendish demons could take in and breathe out the entire Heaven and Earth, traveling unhindered all over the world!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - What Was The Use Of Having You!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosUpon hearing the voice, Su Hong and the rest had a big shock. They paused momentarily before they slowly turned back.\u201cSecond Young Master!\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master is back!\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master is not dead!\u201dThe crowd cheered.Su Hong pressed his lips tightly together, feeling emotional. He was very weak and feeble from the injuries. But there seemed to be a sudden influx of invisible force, and he felt energized.Unlike Song Hong and the rest, although Song Qi was just as happy, he was more surprised and shocked.Song Qi was very clear that it was very difficult to slay the king in the capital and to then fight one\u2019s way out of the heavy encirclement.The capital of the Country of Yan had not just two to three Qi Refinement Warriors, but an entire cultivation clan with them!No one would be able to escape under the siege of the Imperial Army as well as the Qi Refinement Warriors.Song Qi knew that even if he reached Level 10 perfected realm, he would never be able to do it. Perhaps, the Foundation Establishment Cultivators would be capable of accomplishing it.Of course, that was only a possibility.In Song Qi\u2019s eyes, Su Zimo had become even more mysterious and frightening!Song Qi turned to look at Luo Tianwu. There was pity in his eyes, as he thought to himself, \u201cThe City Lord has yet to realize how formidable the opponent that he faces is.\u201dSeeing that Su Zimo had returned safely, given Luo Tianwu\u2019s shrewdness, he forgot himself momentarily and was dumbstruck as well. There was disbelief in his eyes.The gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior behind him was even more shocked, frowning in silence.\u201cAdvisor, why is Su Zimo still alive? Didn\u2019t you say that he will definitely be dead?\u201d Luo Tianwu asked in a low voice.The gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior shook his head. \u201cI have no idea as well. Perhaps he is lucky and he did not encounter any Qi Refinement Warrior. Otherwise, how can he escape from the capital?\u201dFor some unknown reason, Luo Tianwu could sense fear as he stared at Su Zimo on the city tower.\u201cAdvisor, should we be defeated, you must make sure to protect me. At most, we can return to Cang Lang City and wait for a comeback.\u201dThe gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior replied steadfastly. \u201cYour highness, you can rest assured that if things are not going our way, I will leave with you first.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d Luo Tianwu relaxed slightly, feeling reassured.\u2026On the city tower.\u201cSu family? Second Young Master?\u201dCao Wenxing had a shock upon hearing the shouts from below the city tower. He pointed at the back of Su Zimo, looking left and right, speaking in a low voice, \u201cWhen did this person arrive?\u201dHis soldiers remained silent.On the one hand they had no wish to give him a reply, on the other, they had no idea as well. It seemed as if the person appeared out of thin air.Cao Wenxing was used to ordering his troops around. Now that his soldiers refused to say a word, he could not help but scold them at the top of his voice. \u201cA bunch of useless fools. How dare you allow an outsider to get onto the city wall. What\u2019s the use of having you!\u201dRight then, Su Zimo slowly turned to stare at Cao Wenxing with no expression on his face. Cao Wenxing felt his scalp turn numb under this consistent stare. All of a sudden, Su Zimo asked, \u201cDid you give the orders to have our people outside the city killed?\u201d\u201cYes, but so what?\u201d Cao Wenxing took the sword from his waist. He steadied himself and shouted.\u201cHe\u2026 nothing much.\u201dSu Zimo smiled, his eyes turned cold as he said, \u201cAs the City Lord who guards the border of the Country of Yan, not only did you not protect your people, instead you order a massacre of them\u2026\u201dAt the mention of this, Su Zimo paused slightly, there was a burst of coldness from his eyes that one\u2019s heart could not help but jump a bit. He hollered, \u201cWhat is the use of having you!\u201dSwoosh!Su Zimo leaped down, he was still in mid-air but everyone could hear a loud shriek.The Cold Moon Saber was unsheathed.Su Zimo held the Cold Moon Saber in his hand and jumped from mid-air, swinging his arm to form a huge arc. It was as if he was trying to split apart Mount Hua, as he swung the saber toward Cao Wenxing\u2019s head!This stroke was full of flaws.But, this stroke was too vicious!It was so vicious that Cao Wenxing shuddered, unable to come up with a counterattack. He instinctively raised the huge sword in his hands to shield his head.The flash of light from the saber was glaring, every soldier could not help but squint their eyes.Snap!The sword broke in half.Poof!There were flashes of blood.Su Zimo sheathed his saber.Cao Wenxing widened his eyes in shock. There was a strange, vertical red line between his eyes, cutting his face into two.The next moment.Cao Wenxing\u2019s body was split into half, and he flopped down onto the ground. Red blood kept spewing out, staining the bricks red under the wall in no time.All of the soldiers were aghast.One stroke!Cao Wenxing who was at the Connate realm was split into half by the person in front of them!Su Zimo went to Wei Mingcheng\u2019s side, stretching out his hands to help him up. \u201cCan you still fight?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWei Mingcheng disregarded the pain in his chest, he clenched his teeth and shouted. \u201cMister, please be assured. I will get the troops to aid the black armored cavalry outside the city now, we will get rid of the external enemies!\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Su Zimo waved his hand, shaking his head. \u201cThere must not be any internal strife within Jian An City because of this. We must not implicate the people in the city.\u201dWei Mingcheng hurried to say. \u201cMister, you are being too polite. It is our honor to be able to fight along the black armored cavalry. No one would say no to it.\u201d\u201cWe are willing to fight along the black armored cavalry and behead the enemy!\u201d The soldiers on the city walls shouted.It was not until then that Su Zimo finally understood the heights of glory that the black armored cavalry achieved back then, as well as the important figure that his father was to the soldiers.His father\u2019s achievements were so great that the king felt uneasy and insecure. This was why calamity befell him.Su Zimo said softly, \u201cOpen the gate and let the people of the Country of Yan in first, and settle them down. If you still want to slay the enemies, then you can join us outside the city to fight against the enemies.\u201dWei Mingcheng agreed immediately. He looked at the soldiers around him and swung his arms, shouting. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s open the gate first!\u201dWei Mingcheng paused for a second before he turned to look at Su Zimo. \u201cOnce the gate is open, all the people would flock in. Mister, you will not be able to go out for the time being. You would have to wait.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dSu Zimo smiled and turned toward the side of the wall and jumped off.Everyone on the city walls were shocked!Jian An City was one of the cities along the border of Country of Yan. The city wall was sturdy and much higher than other cities. It was as tall as 100 feet!A small piece of stone would split into pieces if it fell off from the city walls, notwithstanding human beings.Wei Mingcheng and the rest hurried forward to take a look at the bottom of the walls.At the same time, the two armies who were engaged in a fierce battle on the battlefield noticed this scene as well. All the soldiers could not help but gape in shock, their eyeballs almost falling out.Su Zimo fell from the top of the city wall at an alarming speed.Bang!There was a deafening sound.Many soldiers could feel the tremor in the ground!Su Hong and the rest could not help but break out into a cold sweat for Su Zimo.They certainly knew that Su Zimo was not a fool or a madman. Since he did this, he would definitely be alright.However, what he did was still very shocking to all of them present.The Postnatal Experts, Connate Experts and even the two Qi Refinement Warriors from the two sides of armies could not help but shiver.The muscles on Luo Tianwu\u2019s face twitched slightly, he paled as he tried to maintain his composure.When Su Zimo dropped to the ground, a lot of dust and gravel came flying up.Under the watchful gaze of countless eyes, a figure loomed in the billowing dust. He took steady strides as he walked towards them, and they could gradually make out his outline and facial appearance\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looked very realistic as it opened its large, fierce-looking mouth. It was a frightening and hideous sight.Bang! Boom! Boom!There were deafening and heart-pulsating sounds from the sky. On the one hand, it sounded like thunder, on the other, it seemed as if the demonic beast was yelling and snarling.\u201cLuo Tianwu, do you still remember what I said to you before I left Cang Lang City?\u201dSu Zimo stopped in front of the two armies, looking straight at Luo Tianwu, who rode a tall and mighty horse in the far distance.Luo Tianwu maintained a calm expression. Many thoughts flashed across his mind, and he smiled suddenly, \u201cSecond Young Master Su, congratulations on taking your revenge. Lord Wuding can rest in peace having such a son like you. Ping Yang Town is proud to have you. As the city lord, I am very proud as well. I will return to Cang Lang City, and prepare a banquet to celebrate Second Young Master Su\u2019s victory. The two of you from the Su family must make sure to come.\u201dLuo Tianwu knew that there was no hope in taking down Jian An City anymore. He quickly made the decision to retreat to Cang Lang City.The King of Yan was dead and the country had become leaderless. It was a great opportunity for him.However, Luo Tianwu still decided to give up. In the world of chaos, ambitious and formidable people like him had to make a decision without the slightest hesitation!Luo Tianwu would not have come this far without this resolution and drive.\u201cI had warmed a snake in one\u2019s bosom and fell short of success at the last stage! If I had known, I should have killed the two of them when they were still kids!\u201dLuo Tianwu lamented inside his mind, but he still had a bright smile on his face.In Luo Tianwu\u2019s opinion, Su Hong would definitely not chase after him if he did not fight back and return to Cang Lang City.In fact, as Luo Tianwu expected, Su Hong came all the way only to protect the people of the Country of Yan. As long as he was willing to retreat, Su Hong would not lead the black armored cavalry to chase after him.Once they went into battle, the black armored cavalry were bound to suffer losses. Su Hong would try to avoid such a situation.However, Luo Tianwu had miscalculated.Because, he was not against Su Hong, but Su Zimo.Su Zimo raised his eyebrows in question. \u201cAre you thinking of escaping?\u201dLuo Tianwu pretended not to know and had a smile on his face. \u201cSecond Young Master Su, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cBefore I left Cang Lang City I said that I hated to be made use of, and I told you to watch your conduct. It is a pity that City Lord Luo doesn\u2019t seem to have taken my words seriously.\u201dThere was mockery in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes. He stared at Luo Tianwu as he said coldly, \u201cAre you thinking of running now? Are you able to run away?!\u201dBang!With that, Su Zimo tapped his feet on the ground and suddenly launched forward, his strides were so rapid that it seemed like shadows. He was right in front of the Cang Lang City\u2019s army in the blink of an eye.There was an army of soldiers in front of Luo Tianwu.However, Su Zimo barged right into them, creating a bloody path as he advanced, no one was able to stop him in his path!\u201cAh!\u201dLuo Tianwu was aghast, retreating automatically as he shouted. \u201cAdvisor, save me!\u201d\u201cJee!\u201dThe gray-robed man executed his flying sword immediately. A beam of light shone on the flying sword. It turned out to be an inferior-grade spirit weapon.Swoosh!The flying sword flew in at an alarming speed. It turned into a bolt of lights, dashing toward Su Zimo\u2019s head.Su Zimo sneered, not reducing his speed in the slightest. Just when the flying sword was about to hit his glabella, he ducked to avoid the flying sword by bare inches, and continued to advance!The gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s pupils constricted in shock.He had not expected that his flying sword would miss the target, and he was most surprised at Su Zimo\u2019s alarmingly fast speed!The gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior immediately controlled his flying sword so that it would change its directions to stab Su Zimo.However, Su Zimo made a leap and was already right in front of the gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior, saying softly, \u201cYou are too weak.\u201dBang!Su Zimo flipped his palms and rested it on the top of the gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s head.His brains burst and blood came shooting out. The gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior had yet to utter a word and he dropped dead from his horse.Su Zimo lowered himself to step onto the strong horse that the gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior used to ride on, and leaped into the sky once again, dashing toward Luo Tianwu, who was not too far away.Luo Tianwu was scared stiff.He had not expected that the Qi Refinement Warrior that he highly valued would be dismembered and slain by Su Zimo after seeing each other face-to-face!It was too fast!Luo Tianwu had no chance to escape.\u201cAh!\u201dIn the life and death moment, Luo Tianwu tried hard to suppress his fear. He roared loudly, taking out his long saber at his waist, using all his strength to swing the saber at Su Zimo!Su Zimo did not dodge.It was unnecessary.Su Zimo reached out his palm, grabbing the oncoming long saber, coldness evident in his eyes.There was a loud splitting sound. Su Zimo made used of his palm to break the long saber into two pieces!Luo Tianwu knew that all hopes were dashed to pieces at that moment.Su Zimo grabbed Luo Tianwu by the throat, saying loudly, \u201cIf I allow you to flee back to Cang Lang City, who will take responsibility for the innocent people who died because of this?!\u201d\u201cWhen there\u2019s a war between the two countries, it\u2019s difficult to judge who\u2019s right and wrong. But you sacrificed the lives of innocent people for your ambitious dreams. I will not let you live!\u201dSnap!Su Zimo exerted strength in his palm and snapped Luo Tianwu\u2019s neck, throwing his corpse aside. He swept his gaze over the surroundings, shouting loudly, \u201cLuo Tianwu is dead, aren\u2019t all of you going to retreat?\u201dThe 50,000 strong army of Cang Lang City were stunned by the aura of one single man. No one dared to move forward.Su Hong, other people and the 5,000 black armored cavalry stood motionless in the far distance.It was not that they did not think of aiding Su Zimo, instead it was that everything happened too quickly.All the people that were present did not expect that Su Zimo would make that move. They also did not imagine that he would be so swift and powerful. He killed Luo Tianwu instantly like lightning!Song Qi had just executed his flying sword and did not even manage to send it flying.In the fights with the other army just now, he had sparred several times with the gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior. Although both of them belonged to Level 8 Qi Condensation, the gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior was far stronger than him.But the gray-robed Qi Refinement Warrior only executed one style when dealing with Su Zimo, and he was slain by him.Cao Gang, the Wolf Guard of Cang Lang City was the first to react. He took in a deep breath before he cupped his fists, saying, \u201cYoung Master Su, thank you for letting us go.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the city.\u201dCao Gang grimly carried Luo Tianwu\u2019s corpse. He felt deeply about the turn of events as he let out a sigh. \u201cThe city lord racked his brains in scheming, but it was a pity that everything was just destiny\u2019s game plan.\u201dWithout Su Zimo, the outcome of today\u2019s battle would be totally different.Cao Gang recalled what happened one and a half years earlier. The young man refused to bow to Perfected Cang Lang and was reduced to an inferior commoner. He had lost almost everything that he had.Who would have thought that it was this young man who came and changed everything.Before leaving, Cao Gang could not help but look at the figure standing proudly in the far distance.The figure seemed to gradually integrate with the young man from one and a half years ago, becoming one.Cao Gang suddenly realized that letting off the young man back then, might have been Perfected Cang Lang\u2019s biggest mistake in his life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had gradually disappeared at the end of the horizon.Wei Mingcheng came before Su Hong, dismounted from his horse and knelt on one knee with cupped fists. \u201cGeneral, thank you for coming over to aid us. I am Wei Mingcheng, the deputy general of Jian An City.\u201dSu Hong dismounted, stretched out his arms to help Wei Mingcheng up. \u201cI am just a commoner, I cannot accept the general\u2019s praise.\u201d\u201cGeneral, it may be presumptuous, but can I ask what is your relationship with Lord Wuding?\u201d Although Wei Mingcheng had roughly guessed the answer, he still wanted to confirm his guess.\u201cSu Mu was my father.\u201dWei Mingcheng nodded.If not, no one else would be able to command the black armored cavalry in this world and for that strong army to serve him willingly.\u201cBrother, this is Zhao Qian\u2019s head, take it home to pay homage to father and mother, so that they can rest in peace.\u201d Su Zimo came over, passing the head at his waist to Su Hong.Su Hong took the King of Yan\u2019s head and looked at Su Zimo, all sorts of feelings welled up in his heart.16 years of forbearance, 16 years of planning, he did not expect that in the end, it was his younger brother who had to bear the burden of taking revenge for the Su family\u2019s blood feud.Su Zimo made no mention of the fight in the capital at all.However, judging from his fatigued look and the blood stains on his body, Su Hong knew that he must have gone through a very violent battle in the capital. He had barely made it back alive.\u201cIs the king really dead?\u201dWei Mingcheng stared at the head of the King of Yan and let out a soft mumble. His eyes suddenly lit up and he looked toward Su Hong, speaking in a serious voice. \u201cGeneral Su, since the King of Yan is dead, all of us are willing to aid you to become king in Jian An City. We can attack the capital, and clear Lord Wuding\u2019s name!\u201dAlthough the King of Yan had covered up the tragedy 16 years ago, in the hearts of the soldiers, they did not believe that Su Mu would revolt.Given Su Mu\u2019s influence and status back then, if he wanted to revolt and take the throne, he had many other opportunities to do so.Uncle Zheng and the rest jolted at his words.If Su Hong wanted to take the throne, this was the best opportunity. The King of Yan was dead and the Country of Yan was in chaos. Su Hong could make use of this battle to build a good reputation in Jian An City.After he took the throne, Su Hong could reveal his identity. Given Lord Wuding\u2019s influence back then, there would definitely be someone among the 16 city lords in the Country of Yan who would genuinely submit to his authority. It might be possible to unify the Country of Yan!At the thought of this, Uncle Zheng whispered, \u201cYoung Master, this is a rare chance.\u201dLiu Yu and the rest looked at Su Hong with anticipation, waiting for his reply.Su Zimo made no comments. No matter what his brother decided to do, he would support him unconditionally.Su Hong smiled after a brief silence, shaking his head. \u201cI thank all of you for your support and love. I don\u2019t have those ambitions. I am sorry to disappoint all of you.\u201dUncle Zheng and the rest looked disappointed.\u201cGeneral Su\u2026\u201d Wei Mingcheng wanted to persuade him, however Su Hong waved his hands to stop him.Su Hong said, \u201cWhen there\u2019s an outbreak of war, those that suffer are the innocent people of the Country of Yan. By then, many people would be destitute and homeless, and separated from their families or orphaned. As Zimo said, if I sacrifice the lives of innocent people to satisfy my own ambitions, how will I be different from Luo Tianwu?\u201dSu Hong paused before he cupped his fists toward Wei Mingcheng, \u201cGeneral Wei, I have to return to Ping Yang Town to worship my father and mother. Let\u2019s say our farewell here.\u201dWith that, Su Hong mounted the horse and led the 5,000 black armored cavalry back to Ping Yang Town.Wei Mingcheng and the other soldiers stood there for a long time staring at the back of Su Hong as he left.\u2026Ping Yang Town, backyard of Su family\u2019s residence.Su Hong, Su Zimo and Su Xiaoning knelt in front of a grave. The King of Yan\u2019s head was placed at the front.Su Xiaoning had broken down in tears.Su Hong was in tears as well.All these years, Su Zimo had never seen his older brother shed a single tear.Even when he failed to assassinate the King of Yan, Su Hong was only disheartened, but he never shed a single tear.Now that they had taken revenge, the hatred and resentment that Su Hong had been carrying with him for the past 16 years was finally released and he could not help but get emotional.Su Zimo did not shed tears. After taking some time to worship his parents, he got up quietly and left the Su family\u2019s residence, returning to the cultivation field right away.There was a flash of disappointment in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes upon entering the cultivation field.It was empty in the cultivation field. Die Yue was not around.Su Zimo stood in the same spot for a long time before taking a deep breath. He seemed to have made a decision. He returned to the backyard of Su family\u2019s residence, giving a glance to Song Qi, and turned to walk outside.Song Qi noticed it and quickly gave chase.\u201cSecond Young Master, is there anything that you want to tell me?\u201d Song Qi asked softly.After a brief silence, Su Zimo took out a golden badge and handed it to Song Qi, saying, \u201cThis is Sky Treasure Gold Badge.\u201dSong Qi was startled.To him, Sky Treasure Gold Badge was something that was unattainable!Many Qi Refinement Warriors would not be able to have a Sky Treasure Bronze Badge until the day they died, notwithstanding a Sky Treasure Gold Badge that was two grades higher.\u201cSecond Young Master, what is the meaning of this?\u201d Song Qi hurried to ask.Su Zimo said in a grim voice, \u201cAfter my older brother is done with the worship of my parents, bring everyone in the Su family to Cang Lang City and hide in Sky Treasure Pavilion for the time being. Don\u2019t come out for now! As for the 5,000 black armored cavalry, break them into smaller groups and disperse them for the time being. Don\u2019t stay together.\u201dSong Qi had never seen Su Zimo being so grim and serious, speaking in such a deep and solemn tone.Song Qi was uneasy as he asked. \u201cSecond Young Master, did something happen? Does the Su family have some other more powerful enemies?\u201d\u201cI killed several Qi Refinement Warriors and offended a clan in the capital. The clan will find their way here in no time.\u201dSu Zimo did not choose to hide the truth.The reason why he could escape from the capital was because there were no Foundation Establishment Cultivators from the Joyful Clan.Now that the Joyful Clan had suffered such a big loss, it was impossible for them to take things lying down. Perhaps, some Foundation Establishment Cultivators had already set off for Ping Yang Town and were already on their way!Song Qi was aware of the seriousness of the situation.If a mortal offended the cultivation clans, one would either die a light death or implicate the entire family!\u201cSecond Young Master, where are you going? Isn\u2019t it better for you to come with all of us to Sky Treasure Pavilion and hide there for the time being?\u201d Song Qi asked.Su Zimo remained silent.Song Qi\u2019s heart sank. He suddenly thought of a possibility and exclaimed in shock. \u201cA-are you going to stop the Foundation Establishment Cultivators from the cultivation clan?\u201dSu Zimo said softly, \u201cIf I don\u2019t die, the cultivation clan will never give up. The Su family can\u2019t possibly hide in Sky Treasure Pavilion for their entire lifetime. Once the Su family appears, they will be hunted down and no one would be able to escape.\u201d\u201cMoreover, seven days have passed since the death of the King of Yan. Given the walking speed of the Foundation Establishment Cultivators, they might have already reached. If no one stops them, they will catch up to us even before the Su family reaches the Sky Treasure Pavilion at Cang Lang City.\u201d\u201cBut, Second Young Master\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother Song, don\u2019t be sullen. I may not die. I might even annihilate the clan.\u201d Su Zimo smiled, putting up a strong front.Song Qi sighed, saying no more.Song Qi knew very well that Su Zimo had made the right decision. But this was in fact using his own life to protect everyone in the Su family!To stop the Foundation Establishment Cultivators, it was tantamount to courting death.Su Zimo had no hopes of surviving.Su Zimo took out a storage bag from his clothes. This was taken from the one-armed Qi Refinement Warrior. He handed it to Song Qi, patting him on the shoulder, saying in a low voice. \u201cI will leave\u2026 the Su family to you.\u201dWith that, Su Zimo turned to leave.It started snowing.This was the first snow in the early winter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He ran faster and faster, his eyes clear, his gaze steady.Su Zimo had barely shut his eyes and slept for the past half a month.In addition to the fierce battle in the capital, Su Zimo was thoroughly exhausted. Although Su Zimo had the essence that was sealed inside his body by the Scarlet Flame Fruit, it was of no help as he was mentally drained.The next battle was the real test for him.A life or death ordeal!If Su Zimo was an ordinary Qi Refinement Warrior, he would definitely die this time.However, since Su Zimo cultivated The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, he was not without any chance of winning.Su Zimo kept thinking about the words that Die Yue told him.\u201cDemon cultivators are best at skipping levels and killing opponents. Given your capabilities now, although you are not as good as Foundation Establishment Cultivators, if you are able to be in their close proximity, you will still be able to instantly kill them!\u201dSu Zimo could only rely on close combat.However, the most difficult part was that the cultivators from the Joyful Clan already had a taste of his abilities at close combat. They would be on guard and he would not be given much chance at close combat!Moreover, Su Zimo had no idea about the fighting prowess of the Foundation Establishment Cultivators.Was it simply manipulating spirit weapons?He knew that it would not be that simple.Su Zimo ran at his fastest speed, reaching Cang Lang Mountain Range in no time.Unlike ordinary men, if cultivators wanted to hurry on with one\u2019s journey, they would fly in the sky. If they wanted to reach Ping Yang Town in the shortest time, they needed to pass by the sky above Cang Lang Mountain Range.Su Zimo would wait here in ambush and kill the Joyful Clan Cultivators!Su Zimo felt an indescribable familiarity at being back in the Cang Lang Mountain Range.Here was his main battlefield!Su Zimo found a towering old tree and used his hands and legs to climb up the tree in no time. He was even more agile than the apes.He had to be in a high spot to be able to notice any suspicious activity and to make the first move.Su Zimo had to consider every detail in preparation for the big battle. This was his only way to turn the tide and survive the battle!Su Zimo sat on the old tree. He placed the Cold Moon Saber horizontally in front of his knees, holding the Sanguine Crystal Bow in his hand, and closed his eyes.This was his final chance to rest.The snow was getting heavier.It kept snowing, covering the entire area.Cang Lang Mountain Range seemed to be covered by a thin layer of white snow, it was crystal clear, a stunning and breathtaking sight.The Sanguine Crystal Bow and Cold Moon Saber were covered with snowflakes. One could no longer tell its original appearance.Su Zimo rested while practicing the breathing and expiration methods of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. His body was heating up while white clouds of vapor rose from the top of his head.Su Zimo\u2019s body might be burning, but his heart became colder each second. He exuded a piercing cold and murderous aura, it covered every corner of Cang Lang Mountain Range.Suddenly!Su Zimo opened his eyes and looked afar.A flock of birds in the forest at the far distance seemed to be given a shock. They spread their wings, soaring to the sky, emitting anxious hooting sounds.They were here!Only two hours had passed since Su Zimo reached Cang Lang Mountain Range!Su Zimo moved slightly and slid down from the old trees, quietly dropping onto the snow. He drew out the last five remaining sharp arrows from the quiver with a backhand grip, nocked all of them on the string, and moved stealthily toward the far direction.\u2026The spirit vessel was the most common flying spirit weapon in the cultivation world. It was steady, fast and had a large capacity.One of the spirit vessels of the Joyful Clan had entered the sky above Cang Lang Mountain Range, speeding forward.There were more than a hundred people on the spirit vessel. Most of them were Level 8 or Level 9, or even Perfected cultivators. The five leading cultivators were Joyful Clan elders. Four of them were early-stage Foundation Establishment, while one of them was mid-stage Foundation Establishment.In the Joyful Clan, only Foundation Establishment Cultivator could be conferred additional titles to be the elder.In order to kill Su Zimo, Joyful Clan had sent almost half of their cultivators out in a hunt for Su Zimo. It proved that the Joyful Clan highly valued the operation this time.If the opponent was a cultivator, even if he was a Qi Refinement Warrior, the Joyful Clan would be wary, lest they provoked the clan that the cultivator belonged to.After all, Joyful Clan was just a small clan. Otherwise, it would not have worked with one of the small states like the Country of Yan.However, Su Zimo was just a mortal. Did he think that he could provoke the clan just because he had a strong physical body and he knew corporal mortification martial arts?If Su Zimo remained alive, and the Su family was not annihilated, the Joyful Clan would become a laughingstock in the cultivation world.\u201cElder Chen, Su Zimo was terrifying in close combat. All of us dared not come close to him. You must be extra careful. You must not get too close to him.\u201d One of the Qi Refinement Warriors who was next to the elder smiled, trying his best to fawn on the elder, and to give him a kind reminder.To his surprise, Elder Chen looked upset and snorted. \u201cIs Foundation Establishment Cultivator the same as Qi Refinement Warrior? Do we need you to remind us?\u201dAnother elder sneered. \u201cNot only would Su Zimo not be able to get close to us, even if he does, he cannot hurt us!\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes. Elder Gao is very right.\u201d The Qi Refinement Warrior looked embarrassed as he plastered a flattering smile on his face.The Qi Refinement Warrior seemed to think of something, but he hesitated and held back his tongue.\u201cSay what you want,\u201d The only mid-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivator said lightly.The Qi Refinement Warrior seemed to be in a panic, his heart still throbbing with fear. \u201cElder Qian, the man had a sanguine big bow. The arrows that were released from it were very powerful and fast. Although it was not as accurate, if it was within a short distance, it has a high lethality. All of the elders must be careful.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dElder Qian smiled, a look of disdain in his eyes, but he remained silent.Elder Gao gave a loud laugh. \u201cAll of you are a bunch of useless fools. As Qi Refinement Warriors, how can you be frightened by the bow and arrow of a mere mortal? You have shamed the clan. When we see him later, he could shoot as he likes, I will show you how I destroy his sharp arrows!\u201dElder Gao was still laughing when a figure appeared at the old tree in front of the spirit vessel, holding a sanguine big bow in his hands.Bow like a full moon and the arrows were ready.\u201cMmm, there is a murderous aura!\u201dInitially, Elder Qian assumed a lotus position on the spirit vessel. However, he was startled and he slapped his hands on the storage bag and a talisman landed on his palm. He squashed it and shouted loudly, \u201cBe careful!\u201d\u201cSwoosh!\u201dThere was a loud sound of arrows piercing through the air.Five sharp arrows glittered and it reached the Joyful Clan cultivators in no time.The five Joyful Clan elders bore the brunt of it.Elder Chen reacted very quickly. Just when Elder Qian squashed the talisman, he also squashed a talisman and he was shrouded by a sparkling light.The other two elders unsheathed their flying swords, blocking horizontally in front of them.Elder Gao was the only one who was still laughing wantonly. He was slow to react and there was a shock in his eyes.The cold light grew larger and larger in Elder Gao\u2019s pupil.Poof!A black light hit directly into the chest, coming out through the body, blood bursting out from Elder Gao\u2019s body!Although the arrow did not hit the heart, the terrifying power that came with it tore the wound open and destroyed all chances of survival for Elder Gao!Elder Gao stood motionless on the spirit vessel, blood spewing from his chest and mouth. There was a look of regret and blankness in his eyes. He muttered softly, \u201cThe arrow\u2026 is so fast\u2026\u201dFoundation Establishment, dead!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Flee With All His MightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay<b>Translator:</b>\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0<b>Editor:</b>\u00a0Atlas StudiosHaving lived in Cang Lang Mountain Range for one year, Su Zimo gained a deeper understanding on fighting.There were many factors affecting a fight. One\u2019s ability was the most basic factor but not the only one.Weather, mindset, environment, preparation and various details could also change the circumstance and even affect the trend of the eventual victory.On this occasion, advanced preparation and the weather were Su Zimo\u2019s advantages.One party was totally unprepared while the other party had long been waiting.Coupled with the heavy snow flying and blocking one\u2019s views, there was low visual acuity. When the cultivators from Joyful Clan came to their senses, five sharp arrows had already appeared before their eyes!Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!Out of the five arrows, two of them hit the respective glowing shields of two Joyful Clan elders. The glowing shield vibrated a little and the sharp arrows bounced off them.The other two arrows had been blocked by the flying swords unsheathed by two Joyful Clan elders.However, the arrow that shot Elder Gao resulted in devastating damage to many cultivators from Joyful Clan!Caught off guard, Elder Gao, who was an early-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivator, was killed with one arrow.Seemingly, this arrow\u2019s power did not weaken as it continued to shoot through the air.The spirit vessel was not large. Over a hundred Qi Refinement Warriors were divided into five rows as they stood behind the five elders, and there were 20 Qi Refinement Warriors standing behind Elder Gao!Even the Foundation Establishment Cultivator did not react in time, much less the Qi Refinement Warriors behind them?The 20 Qi Refinement Warriors felt piercing pains in their hearts even before sighting this sharp arrow. As the vitality in their body drained rapidly, their eyes dimmed and they fell off the spirit vessel.This arrow was too powerful!After piercing through the flesh and blood of 21 cultivators, it still had some strength left. It ended up on a towering old tree with its tail shaking and swaying vigorously.An entire group of 21 cultivators including one Foundation Establishment Cultivator were killed by one arrow shot by Su Zimo.\u201cThat\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Su Zimo!\u201dThe few Qi Refinement Warriors on the spirit vessel recognized Su Zimo and yelled loudly.\u201cRetreat the spirit vessel. Surround and kill this man!\u201dEnraged, Elder Qian hollered harshly.Although this arrow did not hurt the other four Foundation Establishment Cultivators, they could still feel the fear in their hearts.If they were to react slower by a bit, they would already be a corpse!Swash! Swash! Swash!Many Qi Refinement Warriors on the spirit vessel rose to the sky, unsheathed their spirit weapons and attacked Su Zimo at the same time.In a split second, successive flashes of light appeared in mid-air. It was dazzling and eye-catching. Sword auras traveled through the wind and snow like frost, engulfing the heaven and earth.Of course, Su Zimo did not think that he had the capability to contend with a clan. He was already very lucky that the earlier arrow could kill the Foundation Establishment Cultivator.After shooting out five arrows, Su Zimo immediately fled as far as possible without hesitating.\u201cJee!\u201dTwo Joyful Clan elders attacked simultaneously. There was a flash of light on each of the flying swords as they suddenly charged towards the back of Su Zimo\u2019s head at lighting speed.Even before the sword reached him, Su Zimo could feel his scalp exploding. A surge of bone-chilling coldness penetrated his body.\u201cI can\u2019t fight head-on!\u201dSu Zimo realized that he would still be gravely wounded if he were to erupt all his energy to block the flying swords of the Foundation Establishment Cultivators.Elder Chen unsheathed a long cloth from the storage bag and held it towards the direction of the wind. On the rectangular-shaped cloth was an eerie picture of something that looked like a fearsome ghost.All of a sudden!There was a flash of light on the long cloth. That fearsome ghost suddenly opened its eyes and stared at Su Zimo ferociously, giving him goosebumps on the scalp!Su Zimo felt dizzy. His eyes blurred and he began to feel a little dazed.He shuddered in his heart and dared not look at it again. Biting the tip of his tongue, he tried to maintain soberness as he dashed forward continuously, weaving and moving in the forest, and dodging the numerous spirit weapons constantly piercing at him from behind.It was only now that Su Zimo truly experienced the change that spirit perception had brought to him.Honestly, spirit perception\u2019s usefulness was not that apparent during one-to-one fights with cultivators.However, under such successive attacks with lights filling the air and dazzling the eyes, swords and sabers clashing, penetrating gold and splitting rocks, one\u2019s sight and hearing would be greatly affected.Even if Su Zimo could see the flying sword coming over, it would be too late for him to dodge it.Nevertheless, spirit perception was different.It could sense and avert danger without even looking or listening!Su Zimo did not need to look or listen. He relied completely on an incredible instinct that was beyond description while traversing through successive flashes of swords and shadows, and fleeing for his life.Earlier on, Su Zimo shot out five arrows at once because he realized that the other party might not give him another chance to shoot any arrows once the fight began.True enough.The attacks were raining on Su Zimo like raging storms and a devastating downpour. He would be instantly killed on the spot if he were to pause momentarily, let alone shoot an arrow.Oo! Oo!Terrifying sounds that stirred the souls could be heard.Su Zimo\u2019s heart suddenly leaped. He had to force himself to stop charging forward. He then flipped his hand, unsheathed the Cold Moon Saber, turned back and blocked off the dozens of flying swords piercing towards him.Riding on the forces from the flying sword, he tilted his body, fell on one side and rolled on the ground.Bang!There was a deafening sound.Out of the corner of his eye, Su Zimo saw a ring-shaped spirit weapon smashing on the ground, creating a huge pit about three inches from the earlier spot where he paused his steps!If he had moved just half a step forward earlier, his entire body would have exploded upon the impact of this spirit weapon!Su Zimo took a closer look and saw two spirit patterns shining on this ring-shaped spirit weapon.It was a middle-grade spirit weapon!Seeing that Su Zimo had dodged the sure-kill move that he had been waiting for, Elder Qian sneered coldly. He redirected the ring-shaped spirit weapon towards Su Zimo to kill the latter again.Su Zimo crawled with both his arms and legs, moving close to the ground. His body was as flexible and agile as a python as he slithered across the snow, leaving behind a curvaceous trail.The flying sword was about to pierce Su Zimo. Yet, Su Zimo twisted his body in an eerie manner and dodged the attack just in time, never decreasing his speed at any point in time.The fury in many cultivators\u2019 hearts intensified and they attacked even more viciously.Bang! Bang! Bang!The spirit weapons came to nothing and smashed onto the ground countless times after brushing shoulders with Su Zimo.Su Zimo felt slight pangs of pain on his body as raging sandstones hit him.Su Zimo pursed his lips tightly. He looked calm as he gritted his teeth and hung on.The cultivators from Joyful Clan had never seen such movement techniques.He was alternating and interchanging between movements of a galloping horse, a swinging ape and a swathing python with extreme ease.Su Zimo\u2019s physique was completely beyond the comprehension of the numerous cultivators.Even spirit beasts who were known for their strong and powerful bodies definitely could not achieve this!\u201cLad, you have to die today. I\u2019ll see where you can escape to!\u201d Elder Chen hollered furiously, waving the long cloth in his hands. The fearsome ghost on it opened its mouth and released a cloud of black mist.Who would have expected that due to strong winds and heavy snow, just as the black mist was surging out, it was dissipated by the wind and snow and then reversed towards the direction of the Qi Refinement Warriors from Joyful Clan instead.Many Qi Refinement Warriors were caught off guard and stained by the black mist. All of a sudden, their complexions turned purplish-blue and foreheads blackened. They lost their balance in the air and were about to fall.Everyone hurriedly searched out an elixir from his storage bag and swallowed it before the poison gradually eased.Although Elder Chen\u2019s spirit cloth was only an inferior-grade spirit weapon, it could influence the opponent\u2019s mind and heart. The black mist that it released earlier was its trump card.If mid-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivators were slightly distracted, they would also suffer big time.Never did Elder Chen expect that his trump card would not injure Su Zimo but instead caused chaos on his own side.At the sight of this, Elder Qian hollered angrily, \u201cWhat a fool! Put away that lousy cloth of yours and chase this lad properly. He can\u2019t hang on for too long!\u201dElder Chen had an ugly look on his old face. He blamed it all on Su Zimo, and the murderous intent in his heart intensified.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Zimo felt energized. He leaped up and charged diagonally, rampaging forward with the Divine Steed Fleeting movement technique.Elder Qian and the group hurried and chased after him.At a place not far away in front stood a precipitous hilltop.The eyes of Elder Qian and the group shone.Su Zimo did not know flying techniques. He would have to make a detour in order to pass through this hilltop. As such, they could make use of this opportunity to round him up.They might even capture him alive!However, everyone from the Joyful Clan could not understand why Su Zimo neither reduced his speed nor changed his direction. Instead, he charged straight towards the hilltop in front of them.\u201cPerhaps this man is looking for his own death? He wishes to kill himself in the collision?\u201d Muttered a Qi Refinement Warrior.Just as he finished his words, Elder Chen exclaimed in puzzlement.Before Su Zimo\u2019s figure reached the hilltop, strangely, he disappeared!The Joyful Clan people rushed forward to take a closer look. It turned out that there was a cave at the foot of this hill.It was quiet, dark and deep inside the cave. A fearsome beast was seemingly bending over the ground with its big predacious mouth opened and waiting for everyone from Joyful Clan to enter it.Su Zimo actually escaped into this cave!The cave was dark and sinister, narrow and small. Be it Qi Refinement Warrior or Foundation Establishment Cultivator, they could not fly in the air.This meant that the Joyful Clan would not have any upper hand or advantages. On the other hand, Su Zimo turned extremely dangerous and could even possibly slay them!All of a sudden, a layer of haze engulfed the hearts of everyone from Joyful Clan.It was originally a sure victory but for some unknown reason, everyone had a hunch that they had been led around by the nose.To chase or not?If they were to chase him, how should they do it?These two doubts flashed across everyone\u2019s minds.If this cave had a dead end, that would be the best scenario. Everyone could just guard at the cave\u2019s entrance and Su Zimo would die of starvation inside.However, if this was just a tunnel in the hilltop, Su Zimo would have long escaped when the Joyful Clan stayed put to guard the entrance.This was the most tricky part. If the cave had an exit, the people from Joyful Clan did not even know where it was. If they were to go their separate ways, it would be very easy for Su Zimo to attack and destroy them.However, if they look for the exit together but headed towards the wrong direction, Su Zimo would have long escaped without a trace.\u201cDamn, this inferior commoner!\u201d Elder Chen was boiling with fury, and he clenched his teeth and scolded.Elder Qian pondered deeply for a moment before gritting his teeth and saying, \u201cChase!\u201dAfter pausing for a while, Elder Qian said again, \u201cChen Bin, we have talismans to protect us. Even if Su Zimo closes in on us, he won\u2019t be able to break both of our defenses. We will lead the group and guard Gong Liangjing and Lu Wencheng well.\u201dGong Liangjing and Lu Wencheng were the other two elders of Joyful Clan. Although they were Foundation Establishment Cultivators, they did not have any talismans. The weapons that they controlled were also inferior-grade ones.In the cultivation world, it was common for Foundation Establishment Cultivators to do without talismans and control inferior-grade spirit weapons, especially small clans such as Joyful Clan.This was also the reason why Elixir Refinement Master, Weapon Refinement Master and Array Formation Master had special statuses in the cultivation world.If the Weapon Refinement Master could refine middle-grade spirit weapons, many Foundation Establishment Cultivators would have worn out their doorsteps to make friends or exchange spirit stones for their services.With a layer of glowing shield on both Elder Qian and Elder Chen, they entered the cave first. Right on the heels of them were the rest of the Joyful Clan.The grounds in the cave were uneven and full of bumps and hollows. The Qi Refinement Warriors had many treasures in their storage bags but they could not light up the place.They could only rely on the faint glow from the Protection Talisman on Elder Qian and Elder Chen to move quickly forward.The rest of Joyful Clan following behind the elders were ghastly pale. Everyone was high-strung as they surveyed the surroundings, for the fear that Su Zimo would suddenly jump out and catch them off guard.Although Gong Liangjing and Lu Wencheng were Foundation Establishment Cultivators, their palms were also drenched in sweat. They were treading in the cave with fear and trepidation.The atmosphere was getting increasingly stifling!Each time there was a slight movement of grass or wind in the cave, it would cause a commotion among the crowd.Elder Qian and Elder Chen were leading the group at the front. They first observed what was below their feet, followed by what was before them but did not look up at all.Under everyone\u2019s subconscious mind, Su Zimo did not know flying techniques. Naturally, it was impossible for him to appear from the top of their heads.However, they had forgotten one point.This was a cave.There were stone walls on the ceiling of the cave!At this moment, someone was attaching himself closely to the stone wall on the ceiling, narrowing his eyes and staring coldly at the people of Joyful Clan who were striding below him.Suddenly, Elder Qian paused his steps and said in a low voice. \u201cSomething is amiss. There is a stench of blood and it\u2019s very strong. This lad is nearby!\u201dBefore he could finish his words, a flash of blinding light broke the darkness in the cave.Poof!A large skull flung off, splashing fresh blood all over the crowd. Everyone from Joyful Clan suddenly exploded in shock!\u201cElder Lu?\u201d\u201cElder Lu is dead!\u201d\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cAt the top\u2026 Ah!\u201dThere was another miserable scream. One of the Qi Refinement Warriors died on the spot.Prior to this, Su Zimo once shot out five arrows and managed to find out which two of these remaining four Foundation Establishment Cultivator had defensive tactics similar to the Augmentation Talisman.With his current capability, he could not break such defenses at all.Hence, this slash of Su Zimo\u2019s were aimed at Lu Wencheng and Gong Liangjing, who did not have the talisman to protect them.However, Gong Liangjing was more alert. At that instant when Elder Qian paused his steps, he realized that something was not quite right. Hence, he bent down without a care about his pride. As such, he avoided a calamity.When Su Zimo dropped from the stone ceiling and wanted to chase after him, Gong Liangjing had already ran behind Elder Qian and Elder Chen and broke out in a cold sweat.At this very moment, Su Zimo landed in the crowd of Qi Refinement Warriors.In the narrow and small cave, the Qi Refinement Warriors from Joyful Clan barely had any space to dodge. In his panic, someone even bumped into Su Zimo when he was trying to flee.Su Zimo\u2019s sinister and cold laughter resonated in the dark.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 you wish to kill me. Such a small number of people is not enough!\u201dPoof! Poof! Poof!Su Zimo did not even need to look. With the Cold Moon Saber in his hands, he could slay the Qi Refinement Warriors on-site easily with any casual wave of his saber.Along with the miserable screams of Qi Refinement Warriors, flashes of blood appeared constantly as they splattered everywhere.In this cave, Su Zimo was like a tiger moving into a herd of sheep, chopping those on the left and slashing those on the right, going on a rampage. The Qi Refinement Warriors from Joyful Clan could not retaliate at all.Even escaping was wishful thinking!This was an ambush targeted at the Joyful Clan that could be described as perfect.Su Zimo made use of his familiarity with the Cang Lang Mountain Range terrain to successfully lure the other party into the deep, dark and quiet cave.The cultivators\u2019 advantages were minimized whereas Su Zimo\u2019s merits were unleashed to the maximum!The three elders of Joyful Clan stood rooted to the ground, perspiring on their foreheads but did not make any moves.It was not because they did not want to.It was because Su Zimo had been moving about in the crowd continuously. His movement techniques were swift and agile. The cave was already very dim. Once they attacked, they would definitely injure their own clan disciples by mistake.At the sight of the decreasing number of clan disciples, viciousness flashed across Elder Qian\u2019s eyes. He said in a low voice, \u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The other two elders were stunned.\u201cI said, attack!\u201dElder Qian said coldly, \u201cWe can\u2019t worry so much now. Even if we kill our clan disciples by mistake, it is better than letting all of them die in this lad\u2019s hands!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Simultaneously, the trio unsheathed their spirit weapons. There were two inferior-grade weapons and one middle-grade one.Swash! Swash! Swash!The spirit weapons shone brightly, exuding cold and sinister murderous intents and charging forward.Poof! Poof!Two clan disciples from the Joyful Clan were unprepared and killed on the spot by the spirit weapons of the Elder Qian trio.Unabated, the spirit weapons continued to charged at the vital points on Su Zimo\u2019s body!In the small and narrow cave, the people from Joyful Clan barely had any space to avoid the attacks. Nevertheless, this also meant that Su Zimo\u2019s movements would be greatly restricted.Su Zimo did not expect the three elders of the Joyful Clan to be so ferocious and merciless. They actually attacked forcefully without caring about the safety of their clan disciples!Su Zimo tilted his head and averted the ring-shaped sword weapon which was the greatest threat to him. He lowered his body and dodged a flying sword. Using a reverse grip on his saber, he slashed all the Qi Refinement Warriors in front of him.Poof!At the same time, a dot of cold light suddenly appeared on this Qi Refinement Warrior\u2019s chest.Another flying sword came out from this person\u2019s chest and pierced towards Su Zimo\u2019s throat!It was too close!Given the distance, Su Zimo could not avoid it at all.Su Zimo retracted the Cold Moon Saber and then blocked the flying sword.Clang!Clashing sounds of sword and saber could be heard and sparks flew everywhere. Su Zimo\u2019s entire body had taken a huge blow. His purlicue split upon the impact and blood was spilling out from it. The Cold Moon Saber was almost flung out of his hands.Since both parties started fighting, Su Zimo had been trying to avoid a direct confrontation with the Foundation Establishment Cultivators.As expected, the power of the flying swords controlled by the Foundation Establishment Cultivators was definitely not something that his body could endure.Su Zimo\u2019s entire right arm felt numb. He could not exert any strength at that point in time.The inferior-grade spirit weapon directed by an early-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivator was already so powerful. If Su Zimo were to forcefully receive Elder Qian\u2019s ring-shaped middle-grade spirit weapon, he feared he would become paralyzed on the spot!Of course, this slash of Su Zimo\u2019s was not completely useless.Elder Chen\u2019s flying sword should have pierced Su Zimo\u2019s chest but due to colliding with the Cold Moon Saber, it deviated slightly and penetrated Su Zimo\u2019s scapula region, splattering fresh blood everywhere!This was Su Zimo\u2019s first injury since the start of the fight. The piercing pain in his shoulder region was unbearable and he could no longer use his left arm!\u201cIt is so powerful!\u201dSu Zimo was secretly astonished.Su Zimo could escape without the slightest bit of injury when he fought Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors head-on.However, the power of early-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivators had crossed into a different level!Fortunately, although Su Zimo\u2019s right arm felt numb, it did not suffer too huge a blow. After resting for a while, he could still continue with the fight.Su Zimo no longer dared to remain in this place. He turned, used Mountain Reliance to send the few Qi Refinement Warriors who blocked his way flying, executed movement techniques and dashed towards the outside of the cave.Su Zimo was unaware that, at this very moment, the Elder Qian trio were feeling even more stunned, their faces full of disbelief.\u201cHe didn\u2019t die?\u201d\u201cHe actually blocked Elder Chen\u2019s sword?\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\u201cHe is actually still alive and jumping, and has the energy to escape outside?\u201dElder Qian decisively shouted, \u201cHurry up and chase him. This lad is injured and can\u2019t run too far away!\u201dThe three elders followed after Su Zimo first while the remaining Qi Refinement Warriors from Joyful Clan hurried over. They really did not wish to stay any longer in this cave.Before entering the cave, there were still more than 80 Qi Refinement Warriors. Now, there were only about 50 Qi Refinement Warriors left.Most of them died in Su Zimo\u2019s hands, and a few in the hands of the clan elders.In fact, everyone was aware in their hearts that, no matter the outcome, the Joyful Clan had already lost.Five Foundation Establishment Cultivators had led about a hundred Qi Refinement Warriors to chase after a mortal. That was almost half the strength of the clan. Yet, half of the forces were killed!Two elders were dead. The remaining Qi Refinement Warriors were still badly shaken, terrified and wondering what happened.\u201cWe have to kill him!\u201d Elder Qian clenched his teeth and said with a sinister and gloomy expression.Elder Chen revealed a ferocious expression and said viciously, \u201cIt will be best if we can capture him alive. I want to make him suffer endless tortures for the rest of his life, and then crush this lad\u2019s bones into ashes and chop his corpse into ten thousand pieces!\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t let the Su family off too. We will ensure that their blood flows like a river, and even the fowls and dogs will not be spared!\u201d Gong Liangjing said coldly.Everyone from Joyful Clan chased after Su Zimo. Although it was still snowing heavily outside, it was spacious and open. They had finally got rid of the suffocating pressure felt inside the cave.\u201cOver there!\u201dElder Qian pointed to a place in front. Not far away, Su Zimo was dashing continuously, holding onto his left arm, dripping blood and appearing extremely eye-catching on the snowy ground.\u201cChase!\u201dEveryone from Joyful Clan rose to the sky and charged forward.\u201cBrother Qian, the spirit qi on the Protection Talisman can\u2019t hold on for too long. We have to subdue this lad as soon as possible.\u201d Elder Chen said in a low voice. \u201cOnce the protection talismans lose their effect, our lives will also be in danger!\u201dOnce the talisman was released, it could not be effective all the time.After sustaining itself for a period of time, it would lose its effect when the spirit qi on it dissipated.Elder Chen had such a Protection Talisman on him. Once the effect was gone, he would be no different from Gong Liangjing.If he were to encounter the same situation in the cave, it would be hard for him to escape death.Elder Qian nodded.In fact, he had another Protection Talisman in his storage bag. However, protection talismans were very precious and he did not wish to waste it.Elder Qian stepped onto the flying sword, clasped both hands and muttered a sutra. In the wind and snow, as if they had been summoned, a mysterious flow of energy suddenly surged into Elder Qian\u2019s fingertips.\u201cGround-caving Skill!\u201dElder Qian suddenly pointed to the direction in which Su Zimo was escaping.Long before this, Su Zimo had sensed a wave of trepidation in his heart. Upon hearing Elder Qian\u2019s voice, he quickly paused his steps.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe ground right in front of Su Zimo seemed to have suffered a powerful impact. It suddenly collapsed and a huge pit appeared.If Su Zimo was unprepared and his legs wobbled, he would have fallen directly into this deep pit.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s eyes were alternating between shock and puzzlement.He had already foreseen that Foundation Establishment Cultivators would have some mysterious means but the scene before him was truly beyond his knowledge.\u201cVinewood-twining Skill!\u201dIn that split second that Su Zimo was distracted, another sound rang in his ears.\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo was stunned and he secretly cursed. He wanted to go around the huge pit in front of him and run towards the other side.Unexpectedly, just as Su Zimo got up, a few withered branches and vines suddenly crept up from the snow below his feet and ensnared both his legs!Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Sounds of spirit weapons breaking through the air could be heard. It was terrifying and soul-stirring.At this moment, Su Zimo\u2019s body was restrained and he could not move or dodge. Once he was hit by the spirit weapon, he would die instantly.Su Zimo remained calm in the face of danger. He dropped to the ground directly, reverse-gripped the Cold Moon Saber and slashed hard on the vines holding both his feet.Snap!The vines broke.At the same time, spirit weapons successively appeared before him. Su Zimo clenched his teeth, twisted his body till the limit and contracted his large tendons. Crisp and cracking sounds could be heard coming from the bones in his body. He had an extremely close shave with the three spirit weapons from the Joyful Clan elders.After successfully dodging the three spirit weapons, no matter how, Su Zimo could not avert the over 50 other spirit weapons that were coming towards him.Although all of them were from Qi Refinement Warriors, more than 50 Qi Refinement Warriors attacked at the same time. Hence, this was a frightening force not to be underestimated!All of a sudden, the situation became extremely dangerous and Su Zimo was on the brink of death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His entire body muscles tightened, large tendons pulsated and he unleashed his strength to the maximum. Holding the saber in one hand, he swiftly drew an arc in front of him!There were numerous flashes of saber shadows and icy cold lights.Clang! Clang! Clang!Spirit weapons continuously clashed in the shadows of the sabers in front of Su Zimo. Successive sounds of weapons clashing with one another could be heard. Sparks were flying everywhere.Su Zimo\u2019s steps were clumsy and he retreated continuously. There was a sweet taste in his throat as he held a pool of blood in his mouth, refusing to spit it out.Su Zimo gritted his teeth and endured. Once he released this breath, he would instantly lose his life!Bang!Su Zimo\u2019s body landed heavily on a huge pit not far away; his mouth vomiting fresh blood. He lost his grip on the Cold Moon Saber, and his palms were mangled and trembling.Although he had blocked the attack of more than 50 Qi Refinement Warriors, Su Zimo was gravely injured.Under such powerful and intensive blows, Su Zimo\u2019s body crumbled. He was covered in cuts and his green robe drenched in blood.Snowflakes that dropped onto Su Zimo\u2019s body were instantly melted by his body warmth.\u201cEe\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo was ghastly pale. He murmured a little before struggling to sit up. However, he only felt his tendons and bones about to break, and piercing and intensive pain constantly stimulating his brain.Under such aggravating conditions, Su Zimo\u2019s body shivered and twitched uncontrollably.Everyone from the Joyful Clan surrounded the huge pit and looked at Su Zimo from the sky. Their eyes were full of excitement, mingled with some fear and reservation.Finally, this person was going to die.Everyone actually felt relieved of a huge burden.If they were to continue with the chase and this person hid in another cave, everyone including Elder Qian dared not guarantee that they would be courageous enough to enter it.The Elder Qian trio had been in the cultivation world for more than ten years and had gone through many life-and-death battles with cultivators. However, they had never encountered someone who was so difficult to deal with.The most terrifying thing was that this person was not a cultivator but a mortal without any spirit qi!\u201cHahahaha\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo started laughing.Each time he laughed, more fresh blood would spill out from his mouth, making one\u2019s flesh creep.At the sound of Su Zimo\u2019s laughter, many Qi Refinement Warriors felt chills down their spine.\u201cDamn. He\u2019s really a madman!\u201d Some Qi Refinement Warriors cursed in a low voice.Gong Liangjing was having goosebumps from Su Zimo\u2019s laughter. His face dimmed and he said coldly, \u201cI\u2019ll go and kill him!\u201dHaving said that, Gong Liangjing unsheathed his flying sword, wanting to cut off Su Zimo\u2019s head.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dElder Chen stopped Gong Liangjing and sneered. \u201cHe looks half-dead. Are you still afraid that he will escape? We\u2019ll spare his life first, then bring him back to the clan and give him a good round of torture. We\u2019ll make sure that he begs for death!\u201d\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201dAt this juncture, Elder Qian suddenly asked. He narrowed his eyes and stared at Su Zimo.\u201cHehe\u2026 \u201dThere was a flash of mockery in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes. Tilting his head, he spat out a mouthful of blood, raised his brows and said, \u201cDo you really think that you will surely win? Mark my words. Cang Lang Mountain Range will be your tomb!\u201dJust as he finished his words, he gave out a deep and deafening roar, \u201cSanguine Ape Transformation!\u201dThe Sanguine Ape Transformation was the last style of the Sanguine Ape Tri-style. In Die Yue\u2019s words, this style was the essence and also a forbidden skill that could not be used unless one was on the brink of death.Su Zimo rampantly circulated the incantation of Sanguine Ape Transformation and constantly did breathing and expiration.If he did not use this style at this juncture, he would no longer have any chance to do so.At the sound of the three words \u2018Sanguine Ape Transformation\u2019, everyone from Joyful Clan jumped in shock. Elder Qian and trio shuddered and moved a step back instinctively.Everyone\u2019s expression was grave as they fixed their gazes at the Su Zimo in the deep pit, preparing to attack at any point in time.However, after about ten moments of breath, Su Zimo was still sitting in the pit, looking expressionless and still.Nothing changed!Su Zimo\u2019s heart sank deeply to the bottom.How could this be?After circulating the heart sutra of Sanguine Ape Transformation, there was no change to his body. Su Zimo could still feel the pain from the various parts of his body. He felt drained and listless.Previously, when he was rounded up by the wolf packs, Su Zimo had just cultivated Tendons Transformation and was not qualified to release Sanguine Ape Transformation.Now, Su Zimo had already begun cultivating the Bones Strengthening section. Why did nothing happen when he circulated the heart sutra and incantation for Sanguine Ape Transformation?This was Su Zimo\u2019s last trump card.In the end, he discovered that he could not use this trump card when he took it out!As the Sanguine Ape Transformation was a forbidden skill, Su Zimo had never released it before. This was his first time.Su Zimo\u2019s first reaction was that he did not cultivate it correctly.\u201cSomething must have gone wrong somewhere.\u201dSu Zimo wracked his brains and tried to figure out this puzzle.However, this was not the cultivation field and Die Yue was not beside him. Instead, a group of cultivators full of murderous intent in their eyes were staring at him ferociously!No one would help him clear his doubts and the other party would not give him that much time.After waiting for a while, everyone from the Joyful Clan discovered that they could not find the slightest bit of change on Su Zimo.They had been tricked!Everyone was enraged.\u201cDamn, this inferior commoner can still think of fooling us!\u201d One Qi Refinement Warrior cursed and scolded loudly.\u201cKill him!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dEveryone was aggravated and many Qi Refinement Warriors were shouting above him.Almost everyone had their attention on Su Zimo but no one noticed that, in the forest behind them, amidst the wind and snow, a tall and huge figure was swinging on the tree branches and approaching them at lighting speed. Eyes flickering with flashes of blood, his murderous intent was strong!\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo exclaimed in puzzlement. He suddenly smelled a familiar and pungent odor and looked up instinctively.Right behind everyone from Joyful Clan, a tall and huge figure leaped down from the towering old tree, dropping from the sky with a furore. Holding an alloy steel rod in one hand, it was swinging it towards the Qi Refinement Warriors in front of him.Poof! Poof! Poof!The skulls of a total of five Qi Refinement Warriors were smashed by this rod. Their brains split and their headless corpses fell into the pit.\u201cSpirit beast!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a spirit beast!\u201d\u201cBe careful, everyone!\u201dA wave of shock and astonishment could be heard from the crowd.\u201cDamn monkey!\u201dSu Zimo rejoiced greatly in his heart.The big and tall figure that rushed here to help was none other than the spirit monkey whom Su Zimo had lived together with for six months in Cang Lang Mountain Range.The alloy steel rod in the spirit monkey\u2019s hands was the inferior-grade spirit weapon left behind by that Joyful Clan Qi Refinement Warrior who died in Su Zimo\u2019s hands previously. He did not know when the spirit monkey picked it up to become its weapon.Just as the joy in Su Zimo\u2019s heart rose, it completely turned into worries.Although the spirit monkey was powerful, he could only defeat the Qi Refinement Warriors. After all, it had not advanced to the realm of a spirit demon.Furthermore, the spirit monkey had the same weakness as Su Zimo. It could not fly in the sky.At the thought of this, Su Zimo hollered, \u201cDamn monkey, quickly scram!\u201d\u201cGa! Ga!\u201dThe spirit monkey opened its mouth and laughed, seemingly oblivious to Su Zimo\u2019s shout. After killing all five Qi Refinement Warriors at once with one hit from the rod, it did not pause as it leaped into the pit, grabbed Su Zimo and carried the latter on its back. Thereafter, it tried to escape out of the pit without even turning its back.The spirit monkey was very smart.Although he could not differentiate the realms that the cultivators were at, it knew how to assess the situation.Since Su Zimo had been beaten up so badly to the point of no escape, he was definitely not their match.Hence, the spirit monkey\u2019s first thought was not to forcefully fight with the Joyful Clan but to bring Su Zimo out of the place!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a moment of distraction, he leaped onto the flying sword in the sky and led everyone from the Joyful Clan to chase after them.Flashes of lights streaked across the sky.Elder Qian\u2019s face was ghastly pale as he glared at Elder Chen, clenched his teeth and scolded, \u201cLook at your jinxed mouth!\u201dEarlier on, Elder Chen had just said that it was impossible for Su Zimo to escape given the latter\u2019s grave injuries.In the end, an unknown spirit monkey sprang out of nowhere and killed a few of the clan disciples. It even saved and took Su Zimo away.Elder Chen wore an innocent expression.For the sake of chasing and killing this Su Zimo, Elder Chen had already been scolded harshly by Elder Qian twice. He was also enduring a bellyful of anger and had nowhere to vent his frustration.Elder Chen looked at the spirit monkey who was dashing far ahead. His eyes filled with resentment and malice, he said coldly, \u201cThis bastard\u2019s speed is not fast. It can\u2019t run for too long!\u201dSimilar to what happened six months ago when Su Zimo was surrounded by the wolf packs, at a time when he faced critical danger, it was the spirit monkey who stood up for him and saved him from the doors of hell.However, the situation this time was different from that six years ago.The spirit monkey was clever at ascending hills and adept at climbing rocks. It could also leap and swing with extreme ease in the forest. However, speed was not its forte.Furthermore, the spirit monkey was carrying someone on his back.Su Zimo made use of environment, terrain and external factors to cause the Joyful Clan to suffer heavy casualties. However, these factors also made it very hard for the spirit monkey to steer away from the Joyful Clan\u2019s line of sight.These external factors were a double-edged sword. It could benefit both the self and the enemy.It was the beginning of winter and heavy snow was falling. Although the withered trees were still around, they were barren. Without the green, luxuriant forest and camouflage of thick, dense branches and leaves, the trails left behind by the spirit monkey\u2019s escape were visible with one glance.Su Zimo felt listless all over. He leaned on the spirit monkey\u2019s back and listened to the winds howling by his ears. His heart was full of sorrow and misery as he said in a low voice, \u201cDamn monkey, we can\u2019t escape. Put me down and leave on your own.\u201dThe spirit monkey did not utter a sound. Streams of mist surging out from its nostrils, it dashed forward continuously, sweating profusely. Obviously, it was already using all its might and exhausting a lot of energy.The sounds of clothes flapping in the air were coming closer and closer.The speed of the Qi Refinement Warriors\u2019 Sword Kinesis Flight was obviously much faster than that of the spirit monkey!Su Zimo sighed gently, \u201cMonkey, these people only want to kill me. Put me down and you still have hopes of escaping. Otherwise, if we continue like this, they will catch up with us in less than 15 minutes. We will both die here.\u201dThe spirit monkey continued to keep mum. His expression was obstinate and his gaze sharp. He stubbornly dashed ahead.Su Zimo clenched his teeth and punched the spirit monkey\u2019s shoulders harshly. He said loudly, \u201cLeave me alone and only one of us will die. If you take me along, both of us will die! This is such a simple logic. Why can\u2019t you understand? Why can\u2019t you understand?\u201d\u201cDamn monkey, aren\u2019t you very smart and quick-witted? You\u2019ve become a fool! Quickly scram!\u201dRoar! Roar!The eyes of the spirit monkey reddened. It suddenly roared loudly, shaking the heaven and earth. Upon the impact, snowflakes on the surrounding old trees fell one after another.The Joyful Clan group following closely behind were shocked at the sudden roar from the spirit monkey.Fear? Furore? Or hopelessness?They did not know.However, Su Zimo understood.\u201cYours truly wants to do so. It\u2019s none of your business!\u201dThis was the spirit monkey\u2019s response to him.The spirit monkey was not stupid. From the moment that it saved Su Zimo, it already knew that they would possibly die here.However, the spirit monkey still saved him.Six months ago, the spirit monkey saved Su Zimo because of its enmity with the wolf clan.Six months later, the spirit monkey saved Su Zimo because it saw him as his buddy, a buddy that he could share weals and woes with and live and die together.This was the chemistry between a man and a monkey. There was telepathy without the need to communicate in words.Su Zimo was silent for a while. He then laughed.\u201cHahahaha!\u201dSu Zimo laughed heartily.The Joyful Clan group looked puzzled. They did not understand why Su Zimo could still laugh, and in such a hearty and happy manner.Their hearts were already numb and they could not understand the friendship between Su Zimo and the spirit monkey.In the eyes of everyone, the spirit monkey was basically a beast that had not attained spirit intellect, and Su Zimo was a man struggling on his death-bed.However, the more Su Zimo laughed happily, the angrier they felt.\u201cAttack!\u201dElder Qian gave orders. Many flying swords tore the wind and snow and dashed towards them, filling the air.With just a bit of effort and the distance between the two parties had closed so much. They were already within the Joyful Clan group\u2019s geographical scope of attack.The spirit monkey ran left and swung right. Bending its body at one point and leaping at another, it dodged the attacks with all its might.Poof!Flashes of blood appeared.The spirit monkey trembled for a while and staggered. Thereafter, it straightened its back and continued to dash on, pretending that nothing had happened.Su Zimo looked down and saw that the spirit monkey\u2019s thigh had been pierced through by a flying sword. It was bleeding heavily non-stop. A striking and scarlet bloody trail was left on the snow behind it.Su Zimo\u2019s heart ached. He could clearly sense that, earlier on, this sword was heading towards the middle of his back.However, at the eleventh hour, the spirit monkey suddenly jumped\u2026The spirit monkey noticed Su Zimo\u2019s concern. It tilted its head and smiled. It looked a little silly, seemingly wanting to make Su Zimo feel assured.Su Zimo\u2019s sight gradually turned blurry.He was not sure if it was because the snowstorm was too strong or other reasons.The spirit monkey\u2019s speed had obviously slowed down. Its steps were also not as swift and agile as before. It was limping, looking a little unkempt and pitiful.Its thigh had been pierced through and it must be dying of pain. How could it be alright?However, the spirit monkey still did not give up.Suddenly, the spirit monkey threw away the alloy steel rod in his hands, hurled Su Zimo in front of his chest and carried him.This was just a simple action but Su Zimo understood further.The spirit monkey was worried about the flying swords coming from behind.It was worried that the flying sword would hit Su Zimo first. Hence, it carried Su Zimo in front of its chest while baring its own back to the flying swords!The Joyful Clan group was right on their heels and closing in.All of a sudden!The corner of Su Zimo\u2019s eyes twitched vigorously. His scalp was blistering and he broke out in goosebumps.It was extremely dangerous!Without the Cold Moon Saber by his side, Su Zimo took out the Sanguine Crystal Bow immediately. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a ring-shaped spirit weapon amongst the many flying swords behind the spirit monkey. Two dazzling and eye-catching spirit patterns were shining on it.The spirit monkey did not sense the threat of his ring-shaped spirit weapon. It could barely dodge the many flying swords. More wounds appeared on its body, and flesh and blood could be seen. It was a gruesome sight.This ring-shaped spirit weapon was charging towards the middle of the spirit monkey\u2019s back.They could not avoid it anymore!Su Zimo bit the tip of his tongue. He exhausted all of the remaining strength in his body, raised the Sanguine Crystal Bow and smashed towards the ring-shaped spirit weapon.Clang!Su Zimo\u2019s entire body was shaken. The Sanguine Crystal Bow left his hands.A cloud of bloody mist erupted from Su Zimo\u2019s entire right arm. His skin burst open and his large tendons broke. All the bones in his arms were fractured and hanging down.This was a middle-grade spirit weapon and the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivator launched the attack with all his might.Su Zimo could not endure it at all.The ring-shaped spirit weapon paused momentarily upon the impact of the Sanguine Crystal Bow but it still smashed heavily on the spirit monkey\u2019s back eventually.Bang!The spirit monkey\u2019s back caved in deeply. Horrifying sounds of bones breaking could be heard. Its entire body was shaken. Carrying Su Zimo, it was directly hurled into the air before falling onto the snowy ground nearby.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The spirit monkey vomited a huge mouthful of blood that coincidentally landed on Su Zimo, splattering all over the latter\u2019s face.Su Zimo\u2019s mouth was filled with the spirit monkey\u2019s warm blood.The spirit monkey turned to his side with his eyes drooping and pupils losing focus. He stared blankly at Su Zimo, his eyes filled with some indignation, some nostalgia, some reluctance and some regrets.Finally\u2026 it closed both its eyes.\u201cMonkey!\u201dSu Zimo called out, his heart trembling.The spirit monkey did not move the slightest bit. The vitality in its body was draining rapidly.The mid-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivator had unsheathed the middle-grade spirit weapon and attacked with all his might. That had a devastating impact to the spirit monkey.If Su Zimo had not blocked the weapon with the Sanguine Crystal Bow and the weapon were to pierce through the spirit monkey\u2019s body, the monkey could have disintegrated!Su Zimo wriggled his body in the snow and crawled to the spirit monkey. He reached out his uninjured left palm and patted the spirit monkey\u2019s cheeks continuously, speaking in a trembling voice, \u201cMonkey, wake up. Please don\u2019t die!\u201dThe spirit monkey did not utter a sound. It looked like it had fallen asleep.Su Zimo bowed his head. His black hair scattered down and covered both his eyes, which were gradually reddening.It was not light or dark red. It was a bloody scarlet red.It was striking, eerie and frightening!Su Zimo was already covered in wounds. After being splashed with and swallowing the spirit monkey\u2019s blood, a trace of the spirit monkey\u2019s blood had already been integrated into his blood and veins.This trace of blood from the spirit monkey was circulating rampantly in his body and resulted in many strange and chaotic changes.Su Zimo\u2019s veins and blood were boiling!Besides Su Zimo himself, the Joyful Clan people would not be able to sense such changes.The Joyful Clan people floated in mid-air, encircling a man and a monkey. They finally heaved a sigh of relief.Elder Chen looked as though he had a weight off his shoulders. He swallowed his saliva and smiled lightly, \u201cAlthough there were some hiccups, we still didn\u2019t let them escape.\u201dAt the sound of these words, Elder Qian\u2019s face dimmed.Just as he wanted to ask Elder Chen to shut his jinxed mouth up, he heard a sound filled with cold and pervasive murderous intent.\u201cAll of you have to die today!\u201dEveryone glanced at the source of the sound, only to see Su Zimo, who was kneeling on the snow, suddenly standing up and gradually turning his head back. As the cold wind blew past him, a pair of bloody red eyes were revealed.Psst!After being glanced at by this pair of bloody eyes, everyone suddenly felt chills down their spines and could not help gasping in cold.\u201cSanguine\u2014 Ape\u2014 Transformation!\u201dJust as he finished his words, the energy in the blood and veins of Su Zimo\u2019s body surged rampantly. His large tendons pulsated, flesh and blood recharged, body expanded into a strong and huge figure that actually reached a height of ten feet!Ten feet was already slightly more than three meters tall. He was two times taller than an ordinary man!Although the Joyful Clan people were flying in the air, they were at most at the height of about ten feet.If they were too far away, their control of the spirit weapons would definitely weaken.However, Su Zimo\u2019s current height was already ten feet. Both his eyes were at the same level as the Joyful Clan people!In comparison to Su Zimo, everyone suddenly looked relatively small and insignificant.\u201cT\u2014this\u2026 what monster is this?\u201d Some of the Qi Refinement Warriors were so scared that they turned as white as a sheet. Their voices were trembling.Giant!Wrong. This appearance did not belong to the human clan!Sanguine Ape Transformation\u2019s transformation was not restricted to the body figure and height. Even Su Zimo\u2019s appearance had undergone a drastic change. He looked ferocious and frightening, and bore a resemblance to the spirit monkey who was lying on the ground.A giant ape!The muscles on Su Zimo\u2019s body were knotted together like metal casing. They were flickering with metallic shine and filled with an explosive strength!That pair of bloody eyes were exuding endless murderous intent.Wind and snow seemed to have solidified at every nook and crook swept across by that bloody glance.\u201cKill!\u201dSu Zimo gave out a deep and furious roar. He strode forward, reached out his left arm, opened his hands and simply grabbed Gong Liangjing who was in mid-air.Su Zimo hated these three Foundation Establishment Cultivators of Joyful Clan to the core.If not for them, the spirit monkey would not have been injured, and its life or death unknown.Gong Liangjing\u2019s reaction was a tad slower. He had just wanted to reverse his flying sword and dash higher into the sky. However, he had a surprise blackout as Su Zimo\u2019s palm had already enshrouded and clutched him.Su Zimo squeezed hard!Poof!A mist of blood filled the air.Gong Liangjing who was at the early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm was crushed by Su Zimo!At this moment, Elder Qian and Elder Chen had just flew to a height of 20 feet. When they looked back instinctively, their eyes met with this gruesome and bloody scene. They could not help shivering with shock and fear in their hearts.\u201cIt is no wonder that this Su Zimo\u2019s body is so scary. It is because he is not human but demon! He is a spirit beast!\u201d Elder Qian said coldly. He could still feel the fear in his heart.\u201cS\u2014should we report this to the clan first and get more reinforcements to come here?\u201d Elder Chen was also feeling a little scared.Elder Qian waved his hands and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to worry. This Su Zimo must have used some demon techniques to stimulate the potential of his body. He can\u2019t hang on for too long.\u201dJust as he finished his words, Elder Qian saw something from the corner of his eye and was scared out of his wits. He did not even have the time to call out to Elder Chen as he started fleeing to one side.\u201cBang!\u201dBoth Su Zimo\u2019s feet stepped on the ground heavily. His legs bent slightly and then jumped into the air.Initially, there was nothing to be alarmed about a jump.However, Su Zimo\u2019s leap actually covered a height of ten feet!How strong must the body be in order to erupt such frightening strength?Elder Chen heard a deafening sound. Slightly distracted, he felt his vision dimming and he looked up instinctively.Unknowingly, Su Zimo had already appeared at the top of his head.A humongous footprint landed and trampled with the power capable of destroying everything!Bang!The footprint landed on top of Elder Chen\u2019s head. The Protection Talisman was shining brightly and shaking vigorously. Lines of cracks appeared on its surface.This Protection Talisman had been released for a long time. Hence, there was very little spirit qi left on it. On the impact of Su Zimo\u2019s violent strength, it was instantly on the verge of collapse and could shatter to pieces at any point in time.Once the Protection Talisman lost its effect, Elder Chen would be no different from other Qi Refinement Warriors in front of Su Zimo.Elder Chen turned pale with fright. Just as he wanted to flee from the spot with the flying sword, another sole immediately trampled. There was hardly any pause in between.This time, it was even more ferocious, strong and powerful!Divine Steed Trampling.With every successive step, the strength would increase and become stronger!Snap!The Protection Talisman shattered.Another step came.Poof!Elder Chen was directly trampled till death by Su Zimo and ground into minced meat!In the blink of an eye, two out of the remaining three elders of Joyful Clan had died. Only the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Elder Qian was left.Elder Qian knew that Su Zimo would definitely target him next.Swoosh!Elder Qian controlled the flying sword and rose continuously in the air, wanting to distance himself from Su Zimo as much as possible.No matter how strong Su Zimo was or how astonishing the powers he erupted, he could not fly, and that was his weakness.30 feet, 40 feet\u2026In the blink of an eye, Elder Qian had already risen to the height of 50 feet tall!It was only until now did Elder Qian\u2019s expression gradually ease. After calming down, he looked back.\u201cMmm?\u201dElder Qian was stupefied. He exclaimed in puzzlement, \u201cWhere is he?\u201dSu Zimo actually disappeared from the battlefield!How was that possible?He could not have escaped from the place in such a short time.At this moment, the few Qi Refinement Warriors not far away pointed to the front of Elder Qian with shock and fear written on their faces. They seemed to have witnessed a terrifying sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - TombPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay<b>Translator:</b>\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0<b>Editor:</b>\u00a0Atlas StudiosSwoosh!Sounds of snowflakes falling could be heard coming from behind Elder Qian.\u201cMmm?\u201dElder Qian was stunned and he looked back instinctively.Behind him was a tall and old tree. It was sturdy and straight, with a height of about 70 to 80 feet. Using both his hands and legs, Su Zimo was climbing up the tree like a giant ape with extreme ease. He had already reached the height of 50 feet!Elder Qian traveled by air while Su Zimo relied on the old tree to climb up. Yet, there was not much difference in their speeds.Relying on the energy of the blood and veins, Sanguine Ape Transformation could not only improve Su Zimo\u2019s body strength within a short time frame but also cause major transformation to his body\u2019s agility, coordination and flexibility. His speed had thus increased exponentially!The moment that Elder Qian looked back, Su Zimo had bounced off the old tree. The bloody shine in his eyes intensified and the murderous aura was towering. He reached out his gigantic palm, almost engulfing Elder Qian.Su Zimo\u2019s palm looked soft and weak like a tongue. He gently wrapped it on Elder Qian\u2019s body but erupted the strength of twisting and crushing someone. It was extremely cruel and savage.Pa!Elder Qian\u2019s body shook violently. The Protection Talisman shattered on the spot!\u201cGo!\u201dElder Qian\u2019s expression changed greatly. Stepping on the flying sword, he tried his best to balance his body. In the panic and chaos, he quickly unsheathed the ring-shaped spirit weapon in his hands and smashed it towards Su Zimo\u2019s chest.The two parties were very close to each other. Su Zimo\u2019s body was in mid-air and he had no place to lean on. Facing the oncoming ring-shaped spirit weapon, he had to fall on his back with his face facing the sky in order to dodge the attack.But if that were to happen, Su Zimo would also drop from the sky.Su Zimo\u2019s bloody eyes were filled with viciousness. Facing the ring-shaped spirit weapon, he neither retreated nor dodged. His palm transformed into a fist. Using the fist as a seal, his left arms drew a gigantic arc in the air.Boom! The gigantic seal landed!Following Bovine-tongued Saber was Sanguine Ape Fist Seal.Su Zimo would rather take the hit by the middle-grade spirit weapon so that he could kill Elder Qian with his palm!Elder Qian was really panicking.He could clearly sense Su Zimo\u2019s determination to perish together with him.Just as the ring-shaped weapon left his hands, Elder Qian did not think twice about patting the storage bag and took out another brand new Protection Talisman. He immediately tore it with a pinch of his fingers.Elder Qian\u2019s face revealed a pained expression.To him, every talisman was very precious.This was reserved by Elder Qian to save his life. It could block a wave of attacks from Foundation Establishment Cultivator. But now, he actually had to consecutively waste two Protection Talismans when chasing a mortal.Bang!The ring-shaped spirit weapon crashed onto Su Zimo\u2019s chest directly, as if it had hit something strong and hard.The sound of bones cracking could be heard.Su Zimo\u2019s chest caved in deeply, his blood and flesh were mangled.If Elder Qian had not been distracted by the tearing of the Protection Talisman and as a result, caused insufficient energy to condense on the spirit weapon, Su Zimo would have died instantly when he released Sanguine Ape Transformation!Simultaneously, Su Zimo\u2019s fist transformed into a gigantic seal and smashed on the top of Elder Qian\u2019s head heavily!Bang!The gigantic fist collided with the glowing shield formed by the Protection Talisman and erupted a deafening sound. Waves of air gushed and turned the falling snowflakes in the surroundings to vapors instantly.\u201cI blocked it!\u201dElder Qian did not care about rejoicing. He escaped from the place on his flying sword as soon as possible.On the other hand, Su Zimo\u2019s figure dropped from the sky. Fresh blood was spilling from his mouth but the murderous gleam in his eyes did not reduce. He was still glaring viciously at Elder Qian who was fleeing towards a greater height.Bang!Su Zimo landed on the snowy ground heavily. Soon after, he turned and got up, panting and gasping heavily. Each breath of his was accompanied by a strong stench of blood.This were signs of grave injury to his internal organs.The injury to tendons and bones could heal fully after resting for a hundred days.However, it was extremely hard to cure injuries to the vital organs of the body.Furthermore, no one was clearer than Su Zimo about the condition of his own body.The earlier hit by Elder Qian had already crushed his internal organs.He could not live for too long.Elder Qian hid and loitered in the air. He did not leave.In Cang Lang Mountain Range, none of the other old trees had that kind of height. Elder Qian would not give Su Zimo any more chances to come close to him.Su Zimo clenched his fists. Suddenly, with his back facing the spirit monkey whose life and death was still unknown, he rampantly charged towards a direction.Although the Sanguine Ape Transformation could increase Su Zimo\u2019s strength exponentially within a short time, it could not nurse his injuries.This meant that the injuries on Su Zimo were still present. After an intensive battle, the injuries in his body had worsened!The Sanguine Ape Transformation made Su Zimo turn into berserker mode. His nerves were numb and he thus could not feel any pain in the body at all.Although Su Zimo was swift and succinct in his movement techniques, his body had already crumbled both inside and out. He was only relying on the strength of his blood and veins to hang on with one breath.When the time of the Sanguine Ape Transformation was up, Su Zimo would revert back to his original state and become even weaker.At the sight of Su Zimo escaping, Elder Qian chased him hurriedly on the flying sword.The Joyful Clan suffered heavy casualties this time. He was the only one left among the five elders. If he did not kill Su Zimo here, how could he explain this to the clan when he returned.Since Elder Qian had decades of experience in the cultivation world, he could tell that Su Zimo was now an arrow at the end of its flight and could not hang on for long.Although the remaining five Qi Refinement Warriors from Joyful Clan also rushed over, they dared not get too close and kept a huge distance from Su Zimo.Su Zimo\u2019s speed gradually decreased. His body also began to shrink as he slowly reverted to his original appearance.Waves of fatigue surged in his heart and mind. He began to feel the pain on his various body parts intensifying.Su Zimo gritted his teeth and continued to dash ahead.Not far away at the front was a valley. The steep hilltops surrounding it were straight, tall and had strong walls. They looked ordinary, and were very quiet.Su Zimo came to the center of the valley and revealed a trace of a smile.The time for Sanguine Ape Transformation was almost up. Su Zimo arrived at the middle of the valley and paused his steps. With his back facing the spirit monkey, he began to climb up the stone walls.The surrounding stone walls at the valley had many cave entrances. It was pitch dark and there was no light inside them.The Joyful Clan people looked at the Su Zimo who was covered in wounds but still dared not move forward casually.They watched on as Su Zimo climbed into a cave without any further movement. Everyone finally could not endure any further. They flew on their flying swords and arrived at the top of the valley.At the sight of the cave entrances of various sizes on the surrounding stone walls, Elder Qian frowned. Suddenly, a trace of uneasiness flashed across his heart.At that very moment, Su Zimo suddenly appeared at the entrance of the cave, holding a purple gigantic bird in his hands. He looked at Elder Qian and started laughing.That laughter was a little eerie and horrifying. It made people\u2019s hearts shudder.Pierce!Su Zimo tugged with his might and simply broke the neck of this purple gigantic bird. Fresh blood flowed and a unique stench of blood filled the air in the snow and wind.\u201cChirp! Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!\u201dSuddenly, waves of hurried chirps of birds resonated and echoed in the valley. The pitch was getting higher and the sound getting clearer.Commotion could be heard coming from inside the caves of various sizes.At this very moment, Su Zimo\u2019s voice could be heard. It was calm and still but made everyone\u2019s heart instantly sink to the bottom.\u201cI have said\u2026 Cang Lang Mountain Range\u2026 is your tomb!\u201dJust as he finished his words, Su Zimo threw away the gigantic purple bird in his hands and wriggled into the cave.In the cave surrounded by valleys, beams of purple lights shone in the darkness. Their lively eyes actually emanated endless murderous intent!\u201cChirp!\u201dAnother shrieking chirp could be heard, penetrating gold and cracking stones. Initially, they were still far away. When the Joyful Clan people came to their senses, a huge shadow had already engulfed the top of their heads and shrouded the wind and snow\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Its gigantic wings were spreading and shrouding the sky and sun.The wings on the purple eagle were impregnable and had an illustrious, metallic shine. Its pair of claws was strong and powerful, seemingly able to crush the hilltop.This was obviously the leader of the purple-wing eagles. Both its eyes exuded boundless fury and murderous intent!\u201cS-spirit demon?\u201dElder Qian\u2019s voice was trembling and his face drained of colors.In the eyes of cultivators, spirit demons could be divided into two categories \u2013 Foundation Establishment Realm and Golden Core Realm.The purple-winged eagle in front of them should be at the Foundation Establishment Realm but it was obviously much more powerful than Elder Qian! Most importantly, this spirit demon could fly!\u201cChirp! Chirp! Chirp!\u201dChirping sounds of furore could be heard coming from the caves surrounding the valley. Numerous purple-winged eagles flew out of the cave. At one glance, there were hundreds of them!Although these purple-winged eagles were spirit beasts, there were more than enough of them to tear the Joyful Clan people into pieces.There was really nowhere to turn to.They could not even escape!Su Zimo\u2019s earlier words resonated in everyone\u2019s mind.In that moment, everyone understood.Su Zimo came here because he wanted to borrow the powers of these purple-winged eagles in Cang Lang Mountain Range to wipe them out in one swoop.This place was their tomb!\u201cNo\u2026 We didn\u2019t kill it. That purple eagle\u2026 No\u2026 It\u2019s that man in the cave.\u201d A Qi Refinement Warrior spoke incoherently. He was so frightened that his lungs and guts were splitting.It was just that this explanation sounded too feeble.The spirit demons had a strong sense of territory possession.Even spirit beasts and spirit demons who intruded their territory would be viciously attacked by the purple-winged eagles, let alone cultivators from the human clan.Although Su Zimo killed that purple eagle, in the eyes of the purple-winged eagles, they had long classified the Joyful Clan people in the same category as Su Zimo.The detestable human clan!\u201cChirp!\u201dThe purple-winged eagles circling in the high skies chirped. In the next moment, hundreds of purple-winged eagles pounced on the Joyful Clan people murderously.At the same time, the leader of the purple-winged eagles dived down, opened its sharp claws and dashed towards Elder Qian to grab the latter\u2019s head.Everyone from the Joyful Clan felt devastated.This was a doomed situation.The moment that they stepped into the valley, they could no longer get out of it.The winds outside the cave were cold and pervasive. Nevertheless, it was very warm inside the cave.Thick straw mats were placed on the cold ground. Lying on top of them, Su Zimo could hear the miserable cries coming from outside. The corners of his lips curled into a smile.\u201cMonkey, did you hear that? This group of people who harmed you are all going to die.\u201d Su Zimo said softly.The spirit monkey was lying by Su Zumo\u2019s side. Its eyes were shut and it did not respond.Having lived in Cang Lang Mountain Range for six months, Su Zimo knew this place like the back of his hand. Both he and the spirit monkey knew which areas were frequented by spirit demons and which areas posed extreme danger.Su Zimo had planned this well in advance.This was the key reason that he chose Cang Lang Mountain Range as his battlefield.On the warm straw mat were a few oval-shaped bird eggs with faint purplish lines on the eggshells. They looked very beautiful.Su Zimo casually took two of the eggs and knocked them against each other using the remaining bit of his strength.Crack! Crack!Lines of cracks appeared on the eggs and purplish-gold liquid flowed out of them, emitting a strong fragrance.Su Zimo placed one of the eggs by the spirit monkey\u2019s mouth and the other by his own mouth. He sucked the liquid bit by bit. He could not help smiling when he said, \u201cMonkey, haven\u2019t you been longing for this egg? I have brought it here for you today.\u201dThe spirit monkey often mentioned to Su Zimo that eggs of purple-winged eagles were extremely nutritious and tasty. However, there was a purple-winged eagle at the spirit demon level. On normal days, the two of them dared not even approach the eggs.The spirit monkey felt proudest about one thing in its life \u2013 he secretly ate an egg belonging to a purple-winged eagle and escaped safe and sound thereafter.The purple-winged eagles were one of the rare birds that would go through various stages of hibernation during winter.A man and a monkey already had plans to come here to steal the eggs once winter was approaching and when the purple-winged eagles were hibernating. They would be less sensitive to the outside world at that time.Unfortunately, Su Zimo left at the beginning of winter.The spirit monkey\u2019s lips were tightly shut. The purplish-gold liquid flowed down the corner of its mouth and dropped onto the straw mat. There was no response from it all this while.At the sight of this, Su Zimo\u2019s eyes dimmed.The fragrant liquid in his mouth suddenly turned tasteless.The miserable cries outside gradually faded.Elder Qian\u2019s hysterical shout could be heard, \u201cSu Zimo, you can\u2019t leave here even if I am dead! Do you think this group of beasts will let you off? Ah\u2026 \u201dElder Qian cried in pain, and there was no more noise thereafter.Su Zimo smiled.Since he had arrived here, Su Zimo did not intend to leave this place alive.The objective of this plan was for everyone to perish together. It was just that Su Zimo did not expect to implicate the spirit monkey in the end.Su Zimo struggled to stand up and walk out of the cave. Looking at the over 50 corpses beyond recognition in the valley, devoured and torn to pieces by the purple-winged eagles, he shook his head. A flash of mockery streaked across his eyes.So what if they were Foundation Establishment Cultivators?So what if they were an immortal clan?Eventually, they still died in an obscure corner of this Cang Lang Mountain Range without anyone knowing.In actual fact, one would say that the death of the Joyful Clan people was due to Su Zimo\u2019s trap rather than being devoured by the purple-winged eagles.From the moment the Joyful Clan people stepped into Cang Lang Mountain Range, they had already fallen into an invisible net. Led around the nose by Su Zimo, they were heading to the abyss of death with every step that they took.In mid-air, the leader of the purple-winged eagles sensed something as it suddenly lifted its head and landed its icy cold gaze on Su Zimo. The murderous intent was akin to that of a saber.Su Zimo had seen it before on his first night in Cang Lang Mountain Range.The numerous purple-winged eagles gradually stopped devouring the corpses. Flapping their wings in the air, they fixed their gazes on Su Zimo, only waiting for the order from their leader before they charged forward to tear Su Zimo into pieces!\u201cChirp!\u201dThe spirit demon level purple-winged eagle chirped loudly.Swoosh!Numerous purple-winged eagles swarmed over like a turbulent purple sea that would drown Su Zimo in the next moment.Facing the incoming death, Su Zimo was calm. He neither retreat nor panic.From the moment that he embarked on the path of cultivation, Die Yue had told him that he would face unimaginable dangers and could lose his life at any time. He should not expect her to save him.At that moment, Su Zimo replied that life and death were preordained.This moment had eventually arrived.It was just that Su Zimo did not expect it to come so soon.All of a sudden!In Su Zimo\u2019s line of sight, a flash of unrivaled, stunning scarlet color that seemingly wanted to dye the entire world red suddenly flashed across that purple sea. It was impossible to overlook it.The shadow of a figure appeared and blocked the front of Su Zimo.Su Zimo opened his mouth slightly. There was first shock in his eyes, followed by endless delight and happiness.The intruder was clad in a long, blood-colored robe. Back facing Su Zimo, she had a slim figure and her dark tresses were hanging loosely around her neck, blowing in the breeze.\u201cYou dare touch my people. Then, you shall die.\u201dThe calm tone, pleasant voice and lazy drawl. Yet, the dominance in it was suffocating!Su Zimo suddenly felt like crying.He had fantasized countless times about Die Yue appearing in the times of critical danger but had been repeatedly disappointed.\u201cShe, still came.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No longer able to endure it, he collapsed.From the battle in the capital to the slaying of Luo Tianwu in Jian An City, the ambush in Cang Lang Mountain Range to the journey of running for his life, he had not slept or rested for more than two weeks. Having traveled day and night, Su Zimo had already exhausted the last bit of strength in his body.The moment that he shut his eyes, Su Zimo could only see Die Yue stretching out her fair palm and blocking that torrential purple sea with extreme ease.In the next moment, Die Yue clenched her fists.The purple sea exploded instantly, emanating a sorrowful yet breathtaking mist of blood.Su Zimo fainted.\u2026Not knowing how long had passed, Su Zimo gradually regained his consciousness. He could sense a familiar aura when he opened his eyes.This was the cultivation field.Su Zimo was soaked in the wooden barrel. He seemed to have returned to one year ago.Die Yue sat on the green stone not far away with a cold and aloof expression. He did not know what she was thinking.\u201cWhere is the monkey? He\u2026 how is he?\u201d The first thing that Su Zimo did when he woke up was to check on the spirit monkey\u2019s condition.Die Yue did not reply.Su Zimo hurried to explain, \u201cThere is a spirit monkey lying in that cave. He is my friend and suffered grave injuries in order to save me. Miss Die, you must save it! H-He\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo was anxious but he could not continue further.Given Die Yue\u2019s temperament, it was already surprising that she would appear to save him. Why would she care about the life of a spirit beast?After some time, Die Yue said nonchalantly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother about it. Its physique is much stronger than you.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dSu Zimo was momentarily stunned. Thereafter, he was overjoyed. He pursued, \u201cThe monkey is still alive?\u201dDie Yue was silent, seemingly like she could not be bothered to respond.Su Zimo could not help smiling. He continuously nodded and muttered to himself, \u201cNot bad, not bad. Since I manage to survive and that damn monkey\u2019s physique is stronger than mine, it must still be alive.\u201dAfter putting down his worries, a trace of doubt arose in Su Zimo\u2019s heart again. He could not help but ask, \u201cMiss Die, although I am not part of the demon clan, after cultivating The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, why is my physique still incomparable to that damn monkey?\u201dThe corners of Die Yue\u2019s mouth pursed slightly. \u201cYou have only cultivated three sections \u2013 Body Tempering, Tendons Transformation and Bones Strengthening, and only attained initial success for them. The most difficult part of this skill that will cause great changes to your body are all at the later sections. You\u2019re still far from it.\u201dSu Zimo nodded. Looking at his body, he discovered that his right arm, which had almost become invalid, was completely fine now. There were no traces of injury on his body at all.\u201cHow long have I been sleeping?\u201d Su Zimo asked.\u201cTen days.\u201dSu Zimo was secretly shocked.He had suffered such grave injuries. Initially, he had felt very fortunate to have escaped death and thought that he would not recover completely. Unexpectedly, he was almost fully recovered in just ten days after Die Yue saved and brought him back!It was not just that. After this battle, Su Zimo felt that his body had become significantly stronger and more powerful. His bones were tough and strong. He had attained initial success in the Bones Strengthening section!This could be called bringing the dying back to life with a miraculous cure.Was there anything else that Die Yue could not do?Although Die Yue had told Su Zimo from the beginning that he was not allowed to enquire about her background and identity, Su Zimo often pondered deeply about it in private.Who exactly was Die Yue?At what cultivation realm was she at?Suddenly, Su Zimo sensed something and looked over.On the green stone, Die Yue was looking at Su Zimo calmly. Both her eyes were as crystal clear as water. They were beautiful and glistening with traces of ripples.For some unknown reason, Su Zimo suddenly felt a little nervous.\u201cMiss Die, you\u2026 \u201d\u201cI have to go now.\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s expression froze, and his mind went blank.\u201cYou\u2019re not coming back?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSu Zimo was silent and in low spirits. In that instant, the joyful feelings of surviving a calamity vanished completely into the thin air.Die Yue said, \u201cI can\u2019t teach you anymore. Hence, I have planted a spirit root in you. The quality won\u2019t be any lesser than the heaven spirit root. For your next steps, go look for an immortal cultivation clan to join.\u201d\u201cCan a spirit root be planted?\u201d\u201cOthers cannot, but I can.\u201dDie Yue seemed to have thought of something. She smiled faintly and said, \u201cAfter going into immortal cultivation, you can also execute Sword Kinesis Flight. You won\u2019t be in such embarrassing situations again.\u201dCultivators could execute Sword Kinesis Flight and take down the enemy\u2019s head within a thousand miles. It would be untrue if one were to say that he was not envious of this.If he had heard this news earlier, Su Zimo would definitely feel thrilled and overjoyedHowever, Su Zimo really could not lift his spirits now.\u201cWhy?\u201dAfter a long time of silence, Su Zimo looked up and asked.\u201cDo you know why I led you onto the path of cultivation?\u201d Die Yue questioned him instead.Su Zimo shook his head.One year ago, when Su Zimo was down and out and almost lost everything, Die Yue appeared before him and asked \u2018Do you wish to cultivate?\u2019That scene, those words. Su Zimo would never forget them for life.However, Su Zimo did not know why Die Yue had imparted him demon clan cultivation technique and taught him cultivation.\u201cThere are two reasons. First, when we met three years ago, I was at my weakest state. It can be considered that you saved my life by bringing me here. Over the next two years, you prepared meals and sent them to my doorsteps everyday, never stopping once. Although I ignored you, I remember all of it.\u201dAt the mention of this, Die Yue\u2019s slender figure left the green stone. Her entire charisma transformed, exuding an air of arrogance overriding the heaven and earth and could not be overlooked. She raised her voice and said, \u201cI, Die Yue, had never pleaded with anyone or owed anyone anything, except for you. Imparting you cultivation techniques is considered the closing of this karma.\u201dSu Zimo was stunned.Who could be so certain of not pleading with anyone in their entire life?Even immortals could not help feeling fearful at times.To not plead with anyone for life and attain Die Yue\u2019s success, it was hard to imagine the adversities that one would need to experience.\u201cThere is also another reason. I saw my old self in you.\u201dDie Yue looked at Su Zimo and said, \u201cYour exterior appearance is frail and weak but you have the prowess of a tiger at heart. It is just that this ferocious tiger has been in a deep slumber. One year ago, the departure of your childhood sweetheart and the bullying by Perfected Cang Lang had awakened this ferocious tiger in your heart. Do you still remember your reaction when that rogue came to murder you one year ago?\u201dSu Zimo pursed his lips gently and did not utter a word.\u201cYou almost killed him!\u201dDie Yue continued, \u201cWho would imagine that a frail and weak-looking scholar would have such a calm look in his eyes when he felt murderous? Your wrists were so steady. At that moment, in my eyes, you were a jade that had not been carved and polished. You are born to venture into the cruel and bloody cultivation world.\u201dSu Zimo felt a little emotional.If Die Yue had not led him onto the path of cultivation back then, he would most likely have died of depression in the remaining years of his life, much less to mention the blood feud of the Su family.Even if he was a tiger at heart, he did not have a spirit root. Hence, he could only be an old tiger without any claws.Seemingly sensing Su Zimo\u2019s thoughts, Die Yue furrowed her brows gently and said in puzzlement, \u201cYour endowment is one in a million but you lacked a spirit root. Logically, everyone should be born with a spirit root. It is just that there is differentiation between the stronger and weaker spirit roots. However, in this part of the world, many people don\u2019t have a spirit root. This is very strange.\u201dAfter pausing for a while, Die Yue shook her head and said, \u201cForget it. There are hidden secrets in every part of the world. I don\u2019t have the time to probe either. I should be leaving.\u201dHaving said that, Die Yue\u2019s figure moved and she headed outside.Su Zimo hurriedly jumped out from the wooden barrel, casually grabbed a piece of clothing to cover himself and chased after her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He called out loud.\u201cOf course it\u2019s back to my world.\u201dDie Yue turned around and looked at Su Zimo with a smile on her face, as she said jokingly, \u201cYou and I are from two different worlds.\u201dThis was what Shen Mengqi said to Su Zimo when she left him back then.Now that the same words were spoken by Die Yue, there was no contempt in it. Instead, it seemed as if they were very good longtime friends and were joking with each other. Of course, there was a hint of melancholy to it.Die Yue had never used this tone when she spoke to Su Zimo. She seldom smiled at him. It was not until now that Su Zimo realize that Die Yue was really leaving him.\u201cBut, you haven\u2019t taught me the remaining cultivation techniques of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. How can you leave?\u201d Su Zimo racked his brains and finally came up with a reason.Die Yue shook her head. \u201cYou already have the spirit root. You should join the immortal sect, don\u2019t continue with your demon cultivation.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dSu Zimo frowned, saying, \u201cI want to continue with demon cultivation and to learn immortal cultivation!\u201d\u201cImmortal and demon cultivation?\u201dDie Yue\u2019s beautiful eyebrows raised slightly, she could not help but smile. \u201cYou are quite ambitious.\u201dDie Yue paused briefly before she said, \u201cSpirit qi can nourish and temper the body. Although the body will not be as strong as the demon clan, it is still fairly strong. But do you know why most of the cultivators have a weak body?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere is a limit to one\u2019s energy. No matter whether it is immortal cultivation or demon cultivation, one cannot live forever. One cannot escape from life and death. If one continues with immortal cultivation and demon cultivation, there is a high possibility that one cannot reach the end for either cultivation.\u201dSu Zimo thought about it and said, \u201cI want to give it a try.\u201dDie Yue continued, \u201cI won\u2019t stop you if you want to go ahead with immortal and Buddha cultivation. But immortals and demons belong to different worlds. Immortal is immortal, while demon is demon. If you insist on doing immortal and demon cultivation, both sides would not tolerate you. Now that you just started demon cultivation, you should give it up now.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to give up.\u201d Su Zimo insisted stubbornly.\u201cEven if the entire world would turn against you?\u201d\u201cSo what if the entire world turns against me!\u201dTo Su Zimo, this cultivation technique was imparted to him by Die Yue. It had an important significance. Even if the whole world stopped him from cultivating, he would continue with it!After a brief silence, Die Yue said, \u201cThe Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness will get more and more difficult. You won\u2019t be able to succeed without me by your side.\u201dDie Yue sighed at the obstinate look in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes, finally giving in.There was a demonic glitter in Die Yue\u2019s eyes. Thereafter, there were several more sutras in Su Zimo\u2019s mind.Die Yue looked at Su Zimo, saying softly, \u201cThese are the remaining sutras. Remember, if it is too difficult to cultivate, don\u2019t waste your effort on them. Also, if the monkey at Cang Lang Mountain Range runs into trouble in the future, do give it a helping hand.\u201dSu Zimo had a moment of realization upon hearing her words.Die Yue had other intentions when she arranged for him to go through training at Cang Lang Mountain Range.Without the spirit monkey, Su Zimo would not be able to master Sanguine Ape Tri-style within a year.Without the spirit monkey, Su Zimo would not be able to activate the Sanguine Ape Transformation.Although Die Yue never showed up during his one year of training at Cang Lang Mountain Range, she had been keeping a silent watch over him. Otherwise, she would not appear at the final crucial moment.After all, Die Yue cared a lot for him.Su Zimo gazed at Die Yue quietly. His gaze was intense and somewhat irrational. It was as if he wanted to remember Die Yue\u2019s facial features and imprint it deeply in his memory.\u201cIf you want to continue with immortal and demon cultivation, you will experience a lot of unimaginable sufferings. But you must bear in mind that these sufferings will only make you stronger. There is a saying in the Avatamsaka sutra of the Huayan school that I would like to give you as parting words, \u2018to become one of the greatest, you have to work on the foundation and be willing to take hardship and serve others!\u2019\u201dWith that, Die Yue turned around, waving to Su Zimo.Die Yue took a small step and she was in mid-air. Under Su Zimo\u2019s unwavering gaze, her graceful figure gradually disappeared into the air, transforming into a sanguine butterfly, with two bright crescent moons imprinted on the pair of wings.\u201cI left behind three gifts for you. The first gift is the spirit root in your body. As for the remaining two gifts, they may be of use to you in the future.\u201dDie Yue flapped her wings and the surrounding space collapsed and turned into fragments. Cracks formed as a dark void could be vaguely seen in the distance, stirring up chilly wind. It was unnerving.The butterfly flew into the darkness and gradually disappeared.\u201cDie Yue!\u201dSu Zimo ran a few steps and shouted toward the direction that Die Yue flew to. \u201cI will go to look for you!\u201dThe surrounding space gradually returned to normal and the cracks fused together.Right then, a sound was heard coming from the void\u2019s abyss.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201dDie Yue had transformed into a butterfly and left.\u2026It was only when Die Yue left did Su Zimo realize that he had developed a strong attachment and dependence on Die Yue.Su Zimo stood rooted on the ground, constantly thinking about what happened here over the past one year. He was lost in his thoughts.The sun rose, breaking through the dark clouds.Unknowingly, Su Zimo had stood under the peach blossom tree for an entire night, not moving at all.Finally, Su Zimo raised his head, looking into the distance, his eyes finally regained focus. He concealed the pain of separation and reluctance to part with Die Yue deep in his heart. He took a deep breath before he turned to leave.\u2026Su Zimo passed by the Su family\u2019s residence and halted in his tracks.Supposedly, everyone in the Su family should be hiding at Sky Treasure Pavilion at Cang Lang City. But right now, the door to the mansion was opened and he could vaguely hear sounds coming from within.Su Zimo felt perplexed and went in to check.\u201cSecond Young Master?\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master is back!\u201dEveryone in the Su family\u2019s residence was elated to see Su Zimo. Su Hong came out with the rest to welcome Su Zimo.\u201cZimo, are you alright?\u201dSu Hong came forward, grabbing hold of Su Zimo\u2019s shoulder and sized him up.\u201cI am alright.\u201d Su Zimo shook his head, asking, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t all of you at Sky Treasure Pavilion?\u201dSong Qi said, \u201cWe were going to leave Ping Yang Town when a red-robed lady turned up all of a sudden to stop us.\u201dAs Song Qi was recollecting what happened, he still could not hide the shock that he felt back then. \u201cThe lady was very powerful. She did not need to leverage any external objects and she could fly into the air. She must at least be a Golden Core Cultivator! She told all of us to wait for her, saying that she would bring you back.\u201d\u201cAnd she disappeared right in front of us!\u201dAt the mention of the lady, everyone in the Su family could not hide their appalled and shocked expression.Su Zimo hung his head, no one noticed the loneliness and sadness in his eyes.\u201cZimo, is that lady your master?\u201dEveryone in the Su family could tell that Su Zimo had undergone a total transformation. He had changed from a frail scholar to a warrior who could slay Qi Refinement Warriors. It must be due to the mysterious lady.\u201cShe is not my master.\u201dSu Zimo shook his head.Although Die Yue taught him demon cultivation, Su Zimo had never treated Die Yue as his master.\u201cWhere is the lady? We have to express our gratitude to her. We must not neglect her,\u201d Su Hong continued to say.\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201dSu Zimo said softly.Everyone was silent.Su Zimo recovered himself and smiled. \u201cBrother, what plans do you have next?\u201dThe Su family\u2019s situation was tricky. They could not go to the Country of Yan, and they could not stay in the Country of Qi. They could only leave their homeland to stay in other states.\u201cI have no idea as well.\u201dSu Hong sighed softly, looking toward the Country of Yan that was far in the distance as he said in a low voice, \u201cI still can\u2019t bear to leave.\u201dRight then, a black armored cavalry galloped from afar and shouted loudly even before he reached. \u201cReport, Young Master, the Country of Yan\u2019s army are closing in. There are at least hundreds of thousands of them. Among them were cultivators as well!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The first thing right now should be to elect a new king, and to keep the army and the officials\u2019 morale high. Why would they lead an army to deal with us?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dUncle Zheng shook his head as well. \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of soldiers. That is the entire army of the Country of Yan. Will they go to this extent just to deal with the Su family? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cCultivators?\u201dThere was a coldness in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes and he thought to himself. \u201cIt must be the Joyful Clan!\u201dTen days ago, the Joyful Clan sent hundreds of cultivators to hunt down Su Zimo. In the end, all of them were slain in Cang Lang Mountain Range. The Joyful Clan could not possibly take this lying down.Furthermore, the Su family and Su Zimo had no interaction with the cultivation world, their only enemy was the Joyful Clan.\u201cBrother, bring the Su family to retreat to Cang Lang City first. I will follow thereafter,\u201d Su Zimo said in a deep voice.Su Zimo had just finished his sentence and he seemed to sense something, looking into the far distance.At the far end of the sky, there was a group of more than one thousand people rushing over in alarming speed. All of them were cultivators and they were executing the Sword Kinesis Flight in mid- air!Su Zimo squinted his eyes, he could see them very clearly.The cultivators were moving at a fast speed, they were already at the Foundation Establishment realm!This was a group that was made up entirely of Foundation Establishment Cultivators. Could the Joyful Clan be so powerful?\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d Song Qi looked grim as he shook his head.Su Hong clenched his fists, saying in a cold voice, \u201cI will gather the black armored cavalry. We can\u2019t possibly sit here waiting for our deaths.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dSu Zimo stopped Su Hong, shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t act rashly, we will act according to the circumstances.\u201dRegardless of whether it was Su Hong or Song Qi, they had not sparred with Foundation Establishment Cultivators before. But Su Zimo knew the abilities off the Foundation Establishment Cultivators very well.If the group of more than one thousand Foundation Establishment Cultivators attacked them, a 50,000 strong black armored cavalry would be wiped out, notwithstanding a 5,000 strong black armored cavalry!They were not at Cang Lang Mountain Range. Su Zimo was not the opponent of one Foundation Establishment Cultivator, let alone one thousand Foundation Establishment Cultivators.They could do nothing but wait.The one thousand Foundation Establishment Cultivators reached the sky of Ping Yang Town in no time. They were dressed uniformly, and they exuded the harsh and murderous aura. They did not look like cultivators, instead they seemed more like the national army.At the furthest front of the one thousand Foundation Establishment Cultivators was a graceful and magnificent carriage that floated in the air. It was adorned with brilliant jewels and pearls, dazzling and sparkling in midair. Although no one carried the carriage, it floated steadily in midair.There was sparkling bead curtain at the front of the carriage. There seemed to be someone seated in the carriage. One could not tell the person\u2019s facial features due to the bead curtain.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dEveryone in the Su family was shocked.Song Qi, who was a Qi Refinement Warrior, had never seen such a large army either, he was dumbstruck.\u201cSomething is wrong.\u201dUncle Zheng said softly, \u201cThe markings on the cultivators\u2019 costumes seem to be that of the Great Zhou Dynasty.\u201dEvery Foundation Establishment Cultivator who was in midair had an exquisite five-clawed golden dragon imprinted on the sleeves. It was very realistic and majestic.Right then, the leader of the Foundation Establishment Cultivators came out from the crowd. He wore a golden Taoist robe and stood floating in the air. He swept his sharp gaze over everyone in the Su family, pausing slightly when he saw Su Zimo.He then took out a golden silk from his storage bag and spread it out.Su Hong and Uncle Zheng had a big shock at the sight of the golden silk, exclaiming in surprise. \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s imperial edict!\u201dThe Great Zhou Dynasty was the only one who had the right to issue the golden silk and it was from the Emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty!Who was the Emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty?He was the supreme leader of the Great Zhou Dynasty. He had achieved a lot of meritorious deeds, surpassing the ancients and dazzling contemporaries, holding absolute power in his hands!If the Emperor was angered, millions of people had to die!Since the imperial edict was issued, every state in the Great Zhou Dynasty had to submit unconditionally, otherwise it would be seen as an act of defiance and they would be punished by the Great Zhou Dynasty!\u201cKing Qian of Yan was unscrupulous and framed loyal subjects, causing chaos to his country and governance. It is right that he be removed. It was said that Su Hong is the son of Su Mu, and he is well-loved by the people and has courage and wits, loving the people like his own. He is qualified to be the next king. I hereby issue this imperial edict crowning him as king. Everyone is to spread the news and not to hinder the spreading of this edict.\u201dThe golden armored leader who was in midair rolled the imperial edict. He stared at Su Hong and said in a deep voice, \u201cSu Hong, accept the imperial edict.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dSu Hong froze in place, looking shocked. There was disbelief in his eyes.The Great Zhou Dynasty hardly intervened in the affairs of the various states. It was rare that it would issue imperial edicts, let alone crown someone as the king of a vassal state.It was not that Su Hong did not want to be the king.The reason why he rejected Wei Mingcheng\u2019s proposal was that he was worried that if he was crowned king, war would definitely break out and it would implicate the innocent people of the Country of Yan.But right now, with the imperial edict, Su Hong could be crowned the king and yet there would be no wars in the Country of Yan.If anyone had objections and launched a war, he would not be going against Su Hong, but the imperial edict!No one would be so foolish to do such things. It was akin to courting death.More importantly, everyone in the Su family would no longer need to leave their homeland to go to other states, and the black armored cavalry would finally have a place to stay for good.\u201cYoung Master, hurry, accept the edict!\u201d Uncle Zheng was excited, he could not hide his happiness and he urged him softly.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dSu Hong was in a difficult position. He had never seen the emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty before, and the imperial edict came all of a sudden. He could not help but feel worried and perturbed.Su Hong looked toward Su Zimo automatically.Su Zimo frowned, shaking his head.He had never seen anyone from the Great Zhou Dynasty as well. The only possibility was that it was Die Yue\u2019s doing.Before Die Yue left, she told Su Zimo that she had left three gifts for him. One of them was the spirit root, but she did not tell him the remaining two gifts. Could it be that one of the gifts was the crowning of his older brother?But that did not make any sense.Su Zimo felt baffled, he whispered to his older brother. \u201cBrother, you should accept the edict first.\u201dSu Hong nodded and took a deep breath, making a bow, before he knelt down on one knee, saying in a low voice, \u201cSu Hong accepts the imperial edict.\u201dThe golden armored leader waved his hands and the imperial edict landed softly on Su Hong\u2019s hands. It sparkled with gold radiance, exuding a majestic aura, as if the emperor was here.Right then, fumes and dust billowed in the wind from not too far away. There was a thunderous sound of hooves. The Country of Yan\u2019s army had just arrived, they were led by famed generals of the Country of Yan, among them was Wei Mingcheng, the general of Jian An City.Hundreds of thousands of soldiers came galloping over. There were so many of them, one could not see the end of the line.The generals at the front line dismounted and knelt down on one knee at sight of Su Hong, shouting loudly, \u201cWe pay respects to the King!\u201d\u201cWe pay respects to the King!\u201dHundreds of thousands of soldiers yelled and the loud voices resonated.The Su family finally realized that the hundreds of thousands of soldiers were not here to seek revenge, instead they were here to pay respects to the new king of the Country of Yan, and to welcome him back to stand guard at the capital.Although this was a good piece of news, the Su family seemed to be at a loss. They felt that everything was surreal and they seemed to be dreaming.Su Zimo raised his head, looking toward the carriage that was floating in midair. He fixed his gaze on it as if trying to see through it.Swoosh!A porcelain white fair arm reached out from the carriage to lift the bead curtain. A beauty came walking out from the carriage. She was dressed in a yellow long dress, with a ribbon tied at her waist, fully accentuating her exquisite figure.The lady had complexion that was fair as snow. She looked refreshing and mesmerizing. The moment she exited the carriage, the graceful and magnificent carriage seemed to pale in comparison to her.\u201cZimo, didn\u2019t I say that we will definitely meet again?\u201d The lady waved her hands at Su Zimo, smiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone could tell that the lady in front was from a noble family and had a powerful background. She could likely be from the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s royal family.From the tone of the lady, the Su family were further surprised that the lady seemed to be on close terms with Second Young Master Su.The Foundation Establishment Cultivators behind the lady stared at Su Zimo, envy and jealousy evident in their eyes.There was a hint of provocation in the eyes of the golden armored leader.Yao Xue controlled a flying sword and landed on the ground, gazing at Su Zimo who looked astonished. She pursed her lips as she smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201dSu Zimo finally recovered himself, smiling. \u201cAre you the disciple from Azure Frost Sect?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYao Xue nodded, pausing before she continued. \u201cHowever, I am a princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty as well. My surname is Ji. Back then we came together by chance and I hid the fact from you, will you blame me for that?\u201dSu Zimo smiled, shaking his head.Ji was not a common surname. If Yao Xue revealed her surname back then, he would most likely have guessed her background from her surname.But now that he thought about it, there were some clues that pointed to her identity.Ji Yaoxue knew everything about Sky Treasure Pavilion and could gift Su Zimo with a Sky Treasure Gold Badge casually. Ordinary Foundation Establishment Cultivator would not be able to do that.\u201cWe are old acquaintances, aren\u2019t you going to invite me for tea?\u201d Ji Yaoxue bent her head to the side, blinking at him.\u201cSure, come over to my place.\u201dSu Zimo nodded to Su Hong, telling him to rest assured before he brought Ji Yaoxue to his mansion. The golden armored leader brought several Foundation Establishment Cultivators with him and followed them to the mansion. He seemed to be worried that they would be spending time alone.Su Zimo and Yao Xue sat at a round table at the courtyard. There were two cups of fragrant tea that were piping hot. The golden armored leader and the rest stood behind Yao Xue.The golden armored leader stared at Su Zimo, there was hostility in his eyes.Su Zimo had already noticed it but he did not let it bother him.\u201cYao Xue, why\u2026\u201d\u201cAudacious!\u201dSu Zimo had a lot of doubts and was just about to ask Yao Xue some questions when he was yelled at by the golden armored leader.\u201cIt is a taboo for a mere mortal to call the princess by her name!\u201d The golden armored leader sneered. There was contempt in his eyes as he stared at Su Zimo.\u201cDai Xu!\u201dWithout waiting for Su Zimo to speak, Ji Yaoxue arched her eyebrows, speaking in a low voice. \u201cIt is none of your business how Zimo addresses me. Wait by the side.\u201d\u201cThird Princess, the Emperor ordered me to ensure your safety and not to leave your side.\u201d Dai Xu bowed slightly, cupping his fists.\u201cThen keep your mouth shut!\u201d Ji Yaoxue gave a sideways glance to Dai Xu, sending him a look of warning.\u201cYes, Princess.\u201dDai Xu looked upset, he glared at Su Zimo before he answered.Su Zimo remained composed, he ignored Dai Xu\u2019s provocation and did not look in his direction.Ji Yaoxue smiled apologetically at Su Zimo and said, \u201cA few days ago, there was a secret report from Sky Treasure Pavilion and I happened to chance upon it. From the description, I guessed that you were the one who killed the King of Yan. Therefore, I begged my father to issue an imperial edict and came with all of them.\u201dJi Yaoxue did not tell him everything, but Su Zimo could roughly guess what was going on. Before that, the Emperor must have sent people to conduct a detailed check on the Su family.\u201cAre you pleased with this arrangement?\u201d Ji Yaoxue smiled as she asked.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201d Su Zimo nodded.With this imperial edict, Su Hong could be crowned the king without engaging in any fights and the surrounding states would not dare to intrude on the Country of Yan\u2019s territory.To him, this was a big favor.But Su Zimo was not someone to flatter people, instead he would remember their kindness deep down inside his heart.\u201cWhy do you bring so many Foundation Establishment Cultivators with you?\u201d Su Zimo continued to ask.Ji Yaoxue frowned slightly, saying, \u201cAfter returning to the clan, I conducted some investigations on Joyful Clan and discovered that the cultivators are involved in evil deeds. They always abducted women and made use of their Yin energy to supplement their own Yang energy to aid their cultivation. I intend to eliminate this clan, but\u2026\u201dJi Yaoxue paused slightly, there was a flash of doubt in her eyes.\u201cBut what?\u201d Su Zimo could roughly guess the reason, but he did not reveal anything.Ji Yaoxue continued. \u201cBut I found out that more than one hundred Joyful Clan cultivators had died at Cang Lang Mountain Range and they had been through a very vicious fight. It felt as if they were hunting down one man but was instead killed.\u201dAt the mention of this, Ji Yaoxue raised her head to look at Su Zimo.Back then, the Joyful Clan had caused quite a commotion when they hunted down Su Zimo. The entire capital of the Country of Yan had witnessed it.\u201cOh?\u201d Su Zimo expressed his shock at hearing the news. His reaction was appropriate and suitable.Ji Yaoxue thought to herself, \u201cAlthough Zimo is very capable, and he is very powerful in close combat, he would not have the capabilities to slay Foundation Establishment Cultivators. It should not be him, instead it must be someone else.\u201dAfter a brief silence, there was a flash of surprise in Ji Yaoxue\u2019s eyes. \u201cThis is not the worst part. When we reached the place where the Joyful Clan inhabited, we realized that the entire clan was reduced to rubble, bones and corpses were strewn everywhere. No one was alive!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dThis time, Su Zimo really had a shock.Although Su Zimo killed hundreds of cultivators from the Joyful Clan, the clan was still around. If there was a chance, the Joyful Clan would definitely seek revenge.Ten days had passed but there were no news from the Joyful Clan. Su Zimo could not help but be on tenterhooks.He did not expect that the entire clan was wiped out.\u201cThe person who did it was way more powerful than the cultivators of the Joyful Clan. It seemed as if every cultivator of the Joyful Clan died instantaneously! It was definitely a different person from the person on Cang Lang Mountain Range,\u201d Ji Yaoxue said.Su Zimo was reminded of a red-robed figure and a cold and stunning face.According to what Ji Yaoxue had said, Su Zimo could not think of a second person who had the ability and would do such a thing.Before Die Yue left, she must have been worried that the Joyful Clan would seek revenge on him. Therefore, she decided to take drastic measures by annihilating the entire clan, so that he would be free of troubles!However, Su Zimo would never tell anyone about this.Ji Yaoxue let out a long breath before she smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. Other than to crown a new king, there is another reason why I made this trip and it is because of you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Su Zimo asked.Ji Yaoxue took a stone that was the size of a fist out from her storage bag, placing it on the round table. She smiled as she asked, \u201cZimo, do you know what this is?\u201dSpirit stone?Unlikely.Su Zimo shook his head.\u201cThis is a testing spirit stone. It can tell whether someone has a spirit root and as well as the grade of the spirit root.\u201dJi Yaoxue went on to explain. \u201cZimo, given your capabilities, if you have a spirit root, even if it is the most ordinary spirit root, you will have huge achievements in the future.\u201d\u201cThe clan has promised that I can bring someone with spirit root to join the clan. It doesn\u2019t matter even if it is the most ordinary spirit root. Zimo, you should give it a try.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - The Five Main ClansPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay<b>Translator:</b>\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0<b>Editor:</b>\u00a0Atlas StudiosSu Zimo looked at the testing spirit stone. He did not stretch out his hands, instead he seemed to be pondering.Before Die Yue left, she had planted the spirit root for him. He knew that it might be as good as the heaven spirit root. Su Zimo had no doubts about that.Su Zimo had another thought after listening to what Ji Yaoxue had just said.Ji Yaoxue thought that Su Zimo did not really know much about her clan, that was why he was reluctant to stretch out his hands. She began to explain. \u201cIn the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s territory, there are five strongest clans. Zimo, you can be assured that the clan, Azure Frost Sect that I am in, is among the five strongest clans.\u201dSu Zimo was interested and he asked all of a sudden, \u201cWhat are the four other clans?\u201d\u201cThe five main clans are Iridescent Clouds Palace, Southern Mountains Clan, True Fire Sect, Azure Frost Sect and Ethereal Peak.\u201dSu Zimo lowered his head, blowing lightly at the tea leaves floating on the tea. There was a fleeting coldness in his eyes at the mention of Iridescent Clouds Palace.Su Zimo looked up, his expression normal as he asked, \u201cI suppose for those who join the five main clans, they have a high requirement for the spirit root, is that so?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dJi Yaoxue nodded and said, \u201cIf you want to join the five main clans, one needs to have at least a superior-class spirit root. Having a pseudo spirit root and ordinary spirit root will not meet the mark. However, Zimo, you can rest assured that even if yours is a pseudo spirit root, I can bring you to join the clan as well.\u201dThe spirit root could be categorized into five grades \u2013 pseudo spirit root, ordinary spirit root, superior-class spirit root, earth spirit root and the most rare heaven spirit root.That was to say, since Zhou Dingyun and Shen Mengqi were chosen by Perfected Cang Lang from Iridescent Clouds Palace, they must at least have the superior-class or higher grade spirit root.Su Zimo smiled and took a sip of tea, asking casually, \u201cIs there any feud between the five main clans? Or rather, which among the five clans is stronger?\u201d\u201cFeud?\u201dJi Yaoxue shook her head. \u201cThis I do not know, but Iridescent Clouds Palace and True Fire Sect are situated quite close to each other and have been getting along well. The five main clans are similar to each other in terms of capabilities and each has their own strengths. Of which, Ethereal Peak is the most mysterious.\u201d\u201cIn the Great Zhou Dynasty, we will hold a grand match between clans every 10 years. Every clan within the territory of the Great Zhou Dynasty can take part in it, regardless of its size. The five main clans have ranked the top 10 in terms of movement techniques, elixir refinement, weapon refinement and creating talismans.\u201dSu Zimo narrowed his eyes, seemingly pondering about something.Since True Fire Sect and Iridescent Clouds Palace were on close terms, Su Zimo would never join them.As for joining Azure Frost Sect, Su Zimo wanted to give this opportunity to Su Hong and Su Xiaoning. As to who would join the sect, it was entirely up to their destiny.That left Su Zimo with only Southern Mountains Clan and Ethereal Peak.Su Zimo asked again, \u201cAmong the five main clans, which is closest to the Country of Yan?\u201dJi Yaoxue took out a map made from animal skin out of her storage bag. She took a closer look before saying. \u201cThe closest is Ethereal Peak.\u201dSu Zimo nodded, not saying anymore.\u201cZimo, why do you ask all these? Hurry, you should check your spirit root.\u201d Ji Yaoxue urged him once again.Su Zimo smiled lightly. \u201cSome cultivator had checked for me and said that I don\u2019t have a spirit root, so I won\u2019t do the testing.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Ji Yaoxue could not hide her disappointment. but she wanted to give it another try and so she tried persuading him again. \u201cPerhaps the person had seen it wrongly. You should check it again.\u201dSu Zimo said in a low voice, \u201cYao Xue, this is a good chance. I have two closest kins and I would like for them to give it a try, to see whether they have a chance to join Azure Frost Sect.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 is good as well.\u201d Ji Yaoxue hesitated slightly before she agreed.Su Zimo stood up to thank her and he came out with Su Hong and Su Xiaoning, explaining to them briefly how the testing spirit stone worked, and telling them to give it a try.Su Hong waved his hands, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t need to try. Even if I have spirit root, I won\u2019t take the cultivation path. Among the three of us, one has to inherit our father\u2019s legacy and continue with his work. Xiaoning, you can go ahead to test it.\u201dSu Xiaoning was hesitant, she seemed afraid, looking toward Su Zimo for help.Su Zimo smiled, holding his sister\u2019s little hand to the round table, as he spoke in a tender tone, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, all you have to do is to hold on to this stone.\u201dSu Xiaoning nodded, still feeling worried, but she seemed to have made up her mind. She went forward to grab hold of the testing spirit stone.At the moment when Su Xiaoning held the testing spirit stone, five rays of light in different colors shot out from the testing spirit stone.This was the first time that Su Xiaoning saw something like this. She had a shock and she threw the stone away automatically.The five different rays of light represented the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth. It was the pseudo spirit root, the worst spirit root among all.Su Zimo rejoiced greatly in his heart.In any case, this meant that Su Xiaoning had a spirit root, and she could join one of the five main clans\u2014Azure Frost sect!In fact, even without his relationship with Ji Yaoxue, Su Zimo was able to join Azure Frost Sect with the spirit root that Die Yue planted for him.However, Su Zimo could vaguely sense something amiss and wanted to try to keep a distance between he and Ji Yaoxue.What was Ji Yaoxue\u2019s identity?She was the third princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty. She was of noble birth!Su Zimo was aware that their encounter this time had riled the guard behind Ji Yaoxue and he was hostile toward him. If he continued to be on close terms with Ji Yaoxue, he might invite trouble for himself!He was not being afraid of them. It was just that he was still not as powerful and he could not protect himself.But Su Xiaoning was different. She was after all a female, and she would not invite the hostility of others.Indeed, after witnessing the scene, there was a flash of delight in Dai Xu, the golden armored leader\u2019s eyes. He let out a sigh of relief, and he seemingly relaxed his guard.Su Zimo looked at Ji Yaoxue, his expression solemn as he spoke in a deep voice, \u201cSince that is the case, please bring Xiaoning with you. She is timid, and she has not been to faraway places. Do take extra care of her during cultivation in Azure Frost Sect.\u201d\u201cYou can rest assured that I will definitely take good care of her,\u201d Ji Yaoxue said.\u201cBrother, I don\u2019t wish to part with you or to leave Su family.\u201d Su Xiaoning curled her lips, tears welling in her eyes. She was on the brink of crying.Su Hong laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to cultivate. It is a golden opportunity. You must not miss the chance. Besides, when you are stronger, I will be asking you for help in the future.\u201dSu Xiaoning turned tears into smiles upon hearing Su Hong\u2019s teasing words. She nodded seriously. \u201cMmm! I will work hard to cultivate and come back to help brother in the future!\u201d\u201cGo along to pack your things and say goodbye to Uncle Zheng and the rest.\u201dSu Hong left with Su Xiaoning to pack her things. There was a smile in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes as he watched them left.\u201cZimo, you\u2026\u201d Ji Yaoxue wanted to say something but held back her tongue.Su Zimo smiled, standing up to bow to her as he said, \u201cI have to thank you for rendering help this time. It is because of you that the Su family have a place to stay and Xiaoning has a chance to join Azure Frost Sect. If you have anything to ask of me in the future, I will definitely agree to it.\u201d\u201cHumph\u2026\u201dDai Xu smirked, a hint of sarcasm flashed across his face. He curled his lips. \u201cHow dare you boast without shame! She is the third princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty. How will she ever need your help?\u201dSu Zimo smiled lightly, not rebutting his words.Nobody would have imagined that the promise that Su Zimo gave right now would carry a lot of weight in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her black hair cascaded down her back. Her complexion was flawless, there was a touch of melancholy in her sparkling eyes.\u201cZimo, are you really not leaving with me? Even if you can\u2019t join Azure Frost Sect, given your capabilities, you will have great achievements at Great Zhou,\u201d Ji Yaoxue said softly.\u201cNo.\u201dSu Zimo smiled, \u201cI am used to leading an unbridled life. I am unaccustomed to the rules and regulations of the palace.\u201d\u201cZimo, are you interested in joining the Ethereal Peak?\u201d Ji Yaoxue was smart, she could vaguely sense that Su Zimo was deliberately keeping a distance from her.\u201cMmm?\u201d There was surprise in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes, but he did not respond.Ji Yaoxue continued. \u201cIt is more difficult to join Ethereal Peak than other clans. There are many tests to pass. The testing of the spirit root is only one of them. I heard that many high-level Qi Refinement Warriors could not join the Ethereal Peak, you\u2026\u201dSu Zimo sighed in his heart at the look of concern in Ji Yaoxue\u2019s eyes.He knew that Ji Yaoxue was being genuinely good to him. Perhaps it was to return his kindness or for some other reason.But no matter what, he could not leave with Ji Yaoxue.Although Dai Xu had concealed his intentions well, he could not hide from Su Zimo\u2019s spirit perception.The man had murderous intent toward him!It was alright if it was Dai Xu who wanted to kill him, however, if it was the Emperor of Great Zhou who wanted him dead, this was bad news to Su Zimo as well as the Su family.The imperial edict might seem like a reward, however, the Emperor was giving them a warning as well.Since the Emperor of Great Zhou could crown Su Hong as king, he could easily annihilate the Su family as well.The Emperor\u2019s power was vast and mighty and one could not predict his next movement or intention.Die Yue might have been ruthless when she sent Su Zimo to the Cang Lang Mountain Range, but she was teaching him at the same time that regardless of whether it was the mortal world or the cultivation world, it was no different from the Cang Lang Mountain Range, where the strong ruled over the weak, and that was the only way to survive!One had to be able to survive Cang Lang Mountain Range in order to be able to venture into the cultivation world!If one was not powerful enough, one could only be passive and be powerless when others preyed on them.\u201cZimo, what plans do you have?\u201d Ji Yaoxue continued to ask.Su Zimo replied. \u201cTo travel a thousand miles beats reading a thousand books. I might embark upon an adventure.\u201dSu Zimo paused briefly before he bowed to Ji Yaoxue, cupping his fists. \u201cMiss Ji, let\u2019s bid farewell today, please take care.\u201dJi Yaoxue looked dismayed upon hearing that Su Zimo addressed her as \u201cMiss Ji\u201d. After a brief silence, she nodded. \u201cYoung Master Su, take care as well.\u201dJi Yaoxue boarded the carriage and the bead curtain dropped to cover her from view. The two of them seemed to be thrown into two different worlds, and they might not be able to see each other again.Su Xiaoning sat on the carriage and looked outside, tears falling down her cheeks. Ji Yaoxue sighed softly as she took Su Xiaoning into her embrace, saying softly, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe carriage flew up into the air and more than a thousand Foundation Establishment Cultivators maneuvered their swords and followed behind, surrounding the carriage to protect the Princess. They disappeared from the sky of Ping Yang Town in no time.At the end of the procession, one of the Foundation Establishment Cultivators came up to Dai Xu and asked softly, \u201cLeader Dai, do we still need to kill Su Zimo?\u201d\u201cNo need. At least he is tactful, he did not reach out for a yard after taking an inch.\u201dDai Xu sneered. \u201cHe is just a mere mortal. He is but a frog in a well. Just let nature run its own course.\u201dIn the carriage.Su Xiaoning seemed to be overly upset. She collapsed in Ji Yaoxue\u2019s embrace and fell into a deep sleep. The tears at the corner of her eyes were still evident.Ji Yaoxue gazed at the bead curtain, looking forlorn. She frowned slightly, sorrow etched in her features, looking pitiful.\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t be sad over that man, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d Dai Xu said softly outside the carriage.Ji Yaoxue did not seem to have heard him.Dai Xu continued. \u201cPrincess, you are of noble birth and you are from the royal family. He is just a nobody. He is not worthy of you.\u201dJi Yaoxue frowned. She checked on Su Xiaoning who was deep asleep in her embrace before she turned her head and said softly, \u201cIf he is a nobody, then what about you? You don\u2019t have to care about my business. You are not qualified!\u201dJi Yaoxue was harsh but she kept her volume down so as not to wake Su Xiaoning up.\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t blame me for being meddlesome. You will definitely be a Golden Core in the future and you will have a lifespan of 500 years. While he is just a mortal and his lifespan is only about 100 years. It is not practical to choose him as your Dao partner.\u201d Dai Xu continued.Ji Yaoxue\u2019s expression darkened, asking all of a sudden. \u201cDid my father say anything to you?\u201d\u201cNo-nothing.\u201d Dai Xu paused momentarily before he quickly denied.Ji Yaoxue clenched her fists in silence, saying in a cold voice, \u201cDai Xu, let me warn you, don\u2019t you dare to do anything to Su Zimo or the Su family!\u201dDai Xu\u2019s expression hardened, but he remained silent.After a brief silence, Ji Yaoxue sighed softly, feeling upset. \u201c100 years will pass by in the blink of an eye. I am afraid that I will never have the chance to see him again.\u201dUpon hearing this, Dai Xu breathed a sigh of relief, finally putting his heart at rest.Ji Yaoxue had finally realized that if she and Su Zimo were on close terms, it would not be helpful to Su Zimo, instead it would bring disaster to him.Ji Yaoxue looked forlorn, she did not notice that Su Xiaoning who was in her embrace batted her eyelashes but did not open her eyes.\u2026Ping Yang Town.Su Hong and others were about to return to the capital with the army of the Country of Yan.\u201cZimo, why don\u2019t you stay in the capital with me for a period of time?\u201dNow that Su Hong was going to the capital, he would not be returning to Ping Yang Town anytime soon. He was worried at leaving Su Zimo behind by himself.\u201cBrother, you should go now. I will stay in Ping Yang Town for a while before I embark upon an adventure. You don\u2019t have to worry about me,\u201d Su Zimo said.Su Hong frowned. \u201cThere is no one at the Su family\u2019s residence and we don\u2019t have any acquaintances in Ping Yang Town. You are by yourself\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not alone.\u201d Su Zimo smiled.\u201cMmm?\u201d Su Hong was surprised.Su Zimo did not explain. Instead he gave Su Hong a pound on the chest, smiling. \u201cYou should hurry to the capital now. There is no need to worry about me. If there\u2019s a chance, I will go to the capital to visit all of you.\u201d\u201cAlright, we will leave now.\u201dSu Hong mounted the horse and nodded towards Su Zimo. Under the protection of the Country of Yan\u2019s army. Su Hong and the others of the Su family left for the capital, galloping away.The cold wind howled. Su Zimo walked on the empty long street amidst the wind and snow, looking lonely and desolate from the back.Xiaoning had left, so had Su Hong.Everyone seemed to have left him within a day.When Su Zimo reached his own mansion and he pushed the door open, the wind and snow seemed to have stopped and he could feel a sense of warmth rushing toward him.There seemed to be a lady in a bloody red robe standing under the peach blossom tree. It seemed real and yet ethereal, as she turned to smile at him.Su Zimo was not alone and he did not feel lonely.When he came back to his mansion, it was as if Die Yue was by his side, watching him cultivate as usual, kicking and beating him occasionally.Su Zimo smiled and closed the door.Su Zimo had no intention of leaving Ping Yang Town right away.He was waiting.He was waiting for someone.Just like that night one and a half years ago\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The cultivators from the small clans might have higher cultivation base, but they would show respect for him whenever they saw him.Zhou Dingyun enjoyed this feeling very much.However, that was not enough.Whenever Zhou Dingyun enjoyed the glory of being a Qi Refinement Warrior, a scene would flash through his mind automatically.There was no moon that night. He knelt in front of a green-robed scholar, tears on his face as he begged for mercy.This scene felt like a thorn that was stuck deeply in Zhou Dingyun\u2019s throat. It had become increasingly intolerable and uncomfortable over the past two years!The higher Zhou Dingyun\u2019s realm was, the more he could not forget the scene.No matter what achievements he had accomplished, it could not erase what happened that night, as well as the shame that the scholar brought him!After cultivation, Zhou Dingyun knew very well that if he did not remove this thorn, it would become his mental demons in the future.The solution was simple. He would return to Ping Yang Town to kill the scholar and annihilate his entire family clan!And right now, the time had come.Zhou Dingyun had the earth spirit root. He managed to reach Level 8 Qi Condensation within two years. His speed of cultivation was ranked the top few among other cultivators in his sect.Of course, Shen Mengqi who joined the sect with him had heaven spirit root. She had reached Perfected Qi Condensation and was only one step to breaking through Foundation Establishment realm.\u201cThere is definitely no way to defeat Senior Martial Sister Shen. But Level 8 Qi Condensation is enough. Hehe, I suppose there is no Qi Refinement Warrior in the entire Ping Yang Town.\u201dSeeing that Ping Yang Town was right before him, Zhou Dingyun could feel his blood boiling. He could not help but laugh.In the eyes of the normal folks, there was nothing more proud and happy than a glorious homecoming.And right now, Zhou Dingyun had done even better than a glorious homecoming by coming back as a Qi Refinement Warrior!Zhou Dingyun was here not only to annihilate the Su family, but also to make Su Zimo kneel in front of him and to torture him viciously, as well as to reduce the prison of Ping Yang Town to rubble, killing all the prison guards that used to humiliate him.\u201cBy the way, Su Zimo\u2019s younger sister has good looks. I cannot kill her. Haha.\u201d Zhou Dingyun smiled with a lecherous grin.By the time Zhou Dingyun reached Ping Yang Town, it was already midnight.It was a dark and gusty night, it was no different from that night two years ago.There was no one on the empty street. Zhou Dingyun maneuvered his flying sword to reach Su Zimo\u2019s mansion.Zhou Dingyun felt deeply about the familiar mansion.Two years ago, when he was here to assassinate Su Zimo, he had to climb over the wall carefully to get into the mansion. Right now, he could be open about going into the mansion!To put it more accurately, he could fly into the mansion.He wondered how Su Zimo would react when he saw him execute Sword Kinesis Flight.Would he be scared stiff?Would he kneel down right away, kowtowing to him, begging him for mercy?Zhou Dingyun was full of anticipation.Zhou Dingyun came to the courtyard and looked around.It was no different from how it was two years ago. It was the beginning of spring. The peach blossom tree at the courtyard looked the same. The flowers had blossomed and the petals had fallen to the ground.The only change was that there were a sanguine bow and a long saber on the stone table under the peach blossom tree.There was a squeaking sound.The door to one of the rooms in the courtyard opened and out came a green-robed scholar.The green-robed scholar carried a jar of wine, looked calm and composed. He went to the stone table in the courtyard and took a seat casually, pouring two bowls of wine. He looked at Zhou Dingyun who was in mid-air as he said calmly, \u201cCome down, I will treat you to a drink.\u201dZhou Dingyun was stunned.He had thought of all kinds of possibilities when they met, but the scene in front of him was totally beyond his expectation.There was no shock?There was no fear?There was no pleading for mercy?There was nothing at all!The green-robed scholar looked calm and indifferent, making Zhou Dingyun even more eager to kill him.\u201cWhat\u2019s with the pretense?\u201dZhou Dingyun sneered. He had done a check on Su Zimo, he had no spirit qi.This meant that two years had passed and Su Zimo was still a mortal!Zhou Dingyun was fearless as he descended into the courtyard, coming up to the stone table, asking all of a sudden, \u201cYou seem to have known all along that I will be back, is that so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Su Zimo nodded. \u201cWhen I let you off two years ago, I knew that you would return.\u201d\u201cHaha, scholars are indeed smart.\u201dZhou Dingyun broke out into laughter, there was mockery in his eyes, but he changed his tone right then. \u201cHowever, your so-called wits seem childish to me.\u201dZhou Dingyun had been observing Su Zimo. He was hoping to sense something from his expression.But Zhou Dingyun was disappointed.Su Zimo looked at him calmly. His eyes were clear, and there was not even the slightest bit of fluctuation in his mood.Zhou Dingyun smiled dryly. \u201cFate is so amazing. No one would have imagined that the ruffian from Ping Yang Town two years ago would become a Qi Refinement Warrior and underwent such huge changes. Oh, by the way, do you know what is a Qi Refinement Warrior?\u201dZhou Dingyun looked at Su Zimo with provocation in his eyes.Su Zimo sighed softly with emotion as he nodded. \u201cYes, the changes are tremendous.\u201d\u201cDo you know why I chose this time to come back?\u201d Zhou Dingyun asked with a raised eyebrow.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cTwo years ago, right here, at a night like this during the same season\u2026 it\u2019s the two of us as well, but\u2026\u201dZhou Dingyun no longer hid his murderous intent in his eyes, as he said coldly, \u201cThe outcome tonight will be vastly different from that night two years!\u201dSu Zimo smiled and suddenly pushed the wine bowl toward Zhou Dingyun. He nodded and said, \u201cTake a drink.\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dZhou Dingyun was on alert. He could not understand why Su Zimo was so calm and composed.At the sight of the bowl of wine in front of him, a thought flashed in Zhou Dingyun\u2019s mind. He could not help but sneer. \u201cSecond Young Master Su, I suppose there is something about the wine?\u201d\u201cSo this is what you are counting on! Hehe, it\u2019s a pity that I have seen through it.\u201dZhou Dingyun thought that Su Zimo had poisoned the wine and was in a hurry for him to drink the wine.\u201cThere is nothing with the wine. But there is indeed something with the name of the wine.\u201d Su Zimo shook his head.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhou Dingyun asked automatically.\u201cThis the wine to send you on your way.\u201dSu Zimo raised his head to look at Zhou Dingyun, as he said calmly, \u201cAfter drinking this bowl of wine, I will send you on your way.\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhou Dingyun could feel the chills on his back. The glance that Su Zimo gave him reminded him of that night two years ago!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He jumped up, retreated a few steps, reaching his palm toward the storage bag at his waist. He narrowed his eyes and looked solemn.\u201cCalm down, calm down!\u201dZhou Dingyun assured himself. \u201cI am a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior. I underwent a total transformation and am no longer the same person two years ago. I will never be frightened by a scholar. Su Zimo is a mere mortal, what could he count on?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to drink?\u201dSu Zimo smiled, shaking his head. \u201cIf you don\u2019t drink, you won\u2019t have the chance anymore.\u201d\u201cYou are bluffing!\u201dZhou Dingyun gave a loud shout. He slapped his palm on the storage bag, maneuvering a flying sword, shooting out a ray of spirit qi from his fingertip. The flying sword shone brightly.Inferior-grade spirit weapon.\u201cJee!\u201dZhou Dingyun had the flying sword in his hand. He calmed himself and pointed forward. Right then, the flying sword turned into a ray of light, reaching Su Zimo within seconds!Su Zimo did not move a single inch. He seemed like a monk who was in meditation.The flying sword was right in front of Su Zimo\u2019s glabella. It would pierce into it if it went one inch further. However, Su Zimo maintained his composure, and he did not bat his eyelids at all.Zhou Dingyun thought that Su Zimo must be scared stiff. He could not help but grin hideously. \u201cSu Zimo, if you kneel down to beg me for mercy, I can consider not killing you.\u201d\u201cI think you have gotten something very wrong here.\u201dSu Zimo stretched out his palm, gently holding the flying sword in front of him as he said calmly, \u201cIt is the same place, the same season, the same night, and the two of us, but there will not be too much of a difference in the outcome.\u201dThere was a look of malice in Zhou Dingyun\u2019s eyes, as he saw how Su Zimo used his palm to grab hold of the sharp inferior-grade spirit weapon.What a fool!Su Zimo continued. \u201cIf there are any changes, it would be that two years ago I let you off, but today, you won\u2019t be able to leave.\u201d\u201cDamn, how dare you speak conceited nonsense. I will maim one of your palms first!\u201dZhou Dingyun yelled, ruthlessness in his eyes. He maneuvered the flying sword, exerting force for it to spin!In the meantime, Su Zimo\u2019s palm wrapped and hit the sword.Pa!There was a sound as loud as thunder. Zhou Dingyun was given a shock.It was not the flying flesh and spurting blood that he was expecting.Instead, Su Zimo\u2019s palm was intact!Zhou Dingyun was even more surprised that he had lost control of the flying sword!How could this be?The next moment, Zhou Dingyun turned from shock to aghast at the sight that he witnessed.Su Zimo spread his palm and the flying sword lay quietly on his palm. It was covered with cracks.Su Zimo released his hand and the inferior-grade spirit weapon turned into fragments, scattering onto the ground.An inferior-grade spirit weapon was deemed useless!Zhou Dingyun stared at Su Zimo whose eyes had gradually turned cold. His heart sank deeply to the bottom as well.He finally realized that two years had passed and he had become a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior, but Second Young Master Su who was in front of him was no longer the frail scholar back then!He suddenly realized that when Su Zimo said that everything had changed tremendously just now, Su Zimo was not referring to him but to Su Zimo himself!The bowl of wine on the round table was really meant to send him on his way!But Zhou Dingyun still could not figure out why Su Zimo could shatter his inferior-grade spirit weapon with his blood and flesh.Zhou Dingyun did not wish to find out the reason.Right now, his only thought was to leave this place and try his best to steer clear of Su Zimo!Zhou Dingyun took out a flying sword from his storage bag. This was a pseudo spirit weapon.It was already unimaginable for outer sect disciples to receive inferior-grade spirit weapons in Iridescent Clouds Palace. However, it had been shattered by Su Zimo\u2019s palm.Zhou Dingyun stepped onto the flying sword, rose into the air and flew out of the mansion.Before he left, Zhou Dingyun could not help but look back.Su Zimo was not in a hurry to get up. He drank the bowl of strong wine on the stone table unhurriedly before he stood up, tied the long saber to his waist, carried the quiver on his back and took the sanguine bow in his hands.Zhou Dingyun swallowed his saliva, feeling nervous. He turned and used all his energy to maneuver the flying sword, speeding toward the far distance.The wind howled in his ears. Zhou Dingyun could not help but shiver as the wind blew at him. He did not know since when he broke out in cold sweats.Zhou Dingyun left Ping Yang Town in no time.The Cang Lang Mountain Range was not far in the distance. It was pitch dark and he could vaguely hear growling sounds made by the spirit beasts.Zhou Dingyun let out a long breath, putting his heart at rest.Right then, Zhou Dingyun heard a cold voice coming from behind him!\u201cDo you still remember the vow you made on that night two years ago when you knelt down to beg for mercy?\u201dZhou Dingyun was terror-stricken upon hearing this. He almost lost control of the flying sword, causing him to lose his balance and almost fall off from mid-air.Su Zimo!This was Su Zimo\u2019s voice!How was that possible?How did he manage to catch up?Zhou Dingyun\u2019s face was as white as a sheet, breaking out in cold sweats. He tried all his best to maneuver the flying sword to speed forward while he looked backward.Su Zimo was right behind him. He looked calm, as if he was just casually walking. However, every stride that he took was as far as 20 to 30 feet!\u201cHe\u2026 he is not using his full force!\u201dAt the thought of this, Zhou Dingyun seemed to have descended into an icehouse, he felt chills all over his body.Su Zimo\u2019s voice was heard again. \u201cOn that night two years ago, you swore that even if you were lucky enough to join the immortal sect, you would never seek revenge on me. If not, you will suffer a painful death where countless of arrows pierced through your heart.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 since that was the case, you will get what you wished for.\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhou Dingyun finally understood what the sanguine bow on the round table was meant for.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201dZhou Dingyun turned around quickly. He had just uttered a word and he was shrouded by a black shadow in front of him.Whoo-hoo-hoo!Dozens of arrows pierced through the air one after another!Poof!Zhou Dingyun felt pain in his chest. It was as if he had lost something in his body. He felt weak all over and he dropped from mid-air.Zhou Dingyun made a loud thumping sound as he flopped down onto the ground. He was covered with mud and the ground that he lay on had turned blood-red.\u201cEe\u2026\u201dZhou Dingyun lowered his head to look at his chest.It was a bloody mess. There was a bloody hollow as large as a bowl on his chest. His heart was pierced through and shot away by dozens of sharp arrows.Pierced through the heart by countless arrows!Everything seemed to be fated and predestined.There was a breeze in the air. Zhou Dingyun could see a corner of the fluttering green robe in front of him.Zhou Dingyun lay on the ground, looking up at Su Zimo who stood in front of him. There was a strange smile on his face, as he spoke, but his words were indistinct. \u201cI, I am Iridescent Clouds\u2026 Palace, since you, you killed me, you won\u2019t be able to escape. One\u2026 day, Perfected Cang Lang\u2026 will come looking for you\u2026\u201dSu Zimo squatted down and smiled. \u201cI will go look for him before that day comes. You will be the first to go, Perfected Cang Lang will be next in line!\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhou Dingyun\u2019s head dropped to a side, as he took his last breath.Su Zimo pulled the storage bag from Zhou Dingyun\u2019s waist and kept it. He then grabbed his corpse, took a few steps forward before he threw it directly into Cang Lang Mountain Range.It would not take a day before Zhou Dingyun\u2019s corpse was devoured by the spirit beasts.This was getting rid of the corpse to destroy the evidence of one\u2019s crime.No one would know what happened tonight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - The Foggy TestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay<b>Translator:</b>\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0<b>Editor:</b>\u00a0Atlas StudiosThe reason why Su Zimo did not leave Ping Yang Town immediately was to wait for Zhou Dingyun.If Zhou Dingyun was to return to Ping Yang Town and he could not find Su Zimo, he would definitely target the Su family instead.The imperial edict might be a deterrence to the states, but it might not be useful to Qi Refinement Warriors. Moreover, he was the disciple of Iridescent Clouds Palace, which was one of the five main clans.Unless Zhou Dingyun died, Su Zimo could not leave in peace.As what Su Zimo had said to Zhou Dingyun, from the moment he let him off, he knew that Zhou Dingyun would be back.It was just that Su Zimo did not know when Zhou Dingyun would be back.But he was willing to wait. Perhaps it was because he could not ease his concern because of Zhou Dingyun, or that he had a sense of nostalgia and attachment to the mansion, the cultivation field and the particular someone.He had waited for half a year.During the past half a year, Su Zimo was not in a hurry to cultivate the fourth section, Marrow Cleansing of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. Instead he continued to cultivate the first three sections namely, Body Tempering, Tendons Transformation and Bones Strengthening, to strengthen his body and to refine the essence in his body that was sealed by the Scarlet Flame Fruit.Su Zimo had moved on to another realm, he had almost reached phenomenal success for the first three sections.In his spare time, Su Zimo would also practice archery in the cultivation field.It was due to his hard work in practicing archery in the past half a year that he was able to shoot dozens of arrows accurately at where the heart was.Now that he had killed Zhou Dingyun, Su Zimo no longer had any reason to stay at Ping Yang Town. Unexpectedly, he felt an unexplainable sense of loss.Su Zimo went back to the mansion. He stood at the door, watching the peach blossom tree not far away. His eyes were blurred, and he stood there for a long time.The dark clouds seemed to have dispersed, and the moonlight was clear as water. The petals of the peach blossoms fell off the tree. It was like that night two years ago, however the lady was no longer around.Su Zimo recalled a poem that he once read. \u201cLast year in this villa on the same day, On blushed face the fine peach-blossoms portrayed. Today, O You\u2019re gone, my Fair, but where, please? Peach-blossoms are still smiling in Spring breeze!\u201dWhen he was young, Su Zimo could not understand the artistic conception of the four-line poem.And now, Su Zimo was 19 years old. He was no longer young and inexperienced. He could finally understand the sense of sadness that one felt when things had remained the same, but people had changed.Su Zimo would never be able to forget that it was that night when he was at his lowest, feeling frustrated, lost and helpless, when a lady stood among the falling peach blossoms and brought him into the cultivation world.Su Zimo smiled. He stretched out his hands and closed the door to his mansion slowly.Now that he closed the door, Su Zimo was shutting the mansion and the very precious memory that he held dear to him, to a close as well.Only when he reunited with that person would he open the door to this memory.Su Zimo looked forward to that day.After a long time, the sky gradually brightened. Su Zimo took a deep breath, his eyes clearing up. He took out a map made of animal skin from his clothes and looked carefully at it, taking big strides towards a certain direction.A ray of light broke through the dark clouds in the sky behind him.The morning sun rose from the eastern horizon.A new day had begun.\u2026In the southwest region of the Great Zhou dynasty, there was a place in the vicinity that was very famous.There would be dense fog all year round. If one watched from afar, it was as if it was enveloped by countless unpredictable clouds. It was ethereal and it did not seem like the mortal world.Curious men and women once went into the fog to find out what it was, but they would always end up in the same place that they started out.In the course of time, all the nearby villagers knew that this was the place where immortals resided and mortals were forbidden entry.Every year, there would be a few days whereby the villagers could vaguely see a mountain peak within the thick fog. It towered into the clouds, looking majestic and grandiose.During these few days, the nearby villagers would kneel down in the direction of the mountain peaks, praying for favorable weather and good health.This day, a green-robed scholar came to their village.It was not really accurate to call him a scholar.The man looked handsome, however there was a long saber at his waist and a sanguine bow at his back. His outfit was quite odd.The green-robed scholar was none other than Su Zimo who had left Ping Yang Town.Ji Yaoxue was correct. Su Zimo had indeed thought of joining the Ethereal Peak.On one hand, since even Ji Yaoxue found that the Ethereal Peak was mysterious, it must be extraordinary.On the other hand, since the Ethereal Peak was the closest to the Country of Yan, if anything happened, Su Zimo would be able to rush back as soon as possible.It was just that on the map, it only marked the approximate location of the Ethereal Peak. Once Su Zimo reached the place, he was enveloped by thick fog and he could not find its exact location.Su Zimo had walked for a day and he always ended up at the same spot. He was clueless.Su Zimo could not see clearly in the thick fog. The visibility was low. Given his eyesight, he could only see ten meters away.The place seemed like a maze. He kept walking in circles in the thick fog, but he could not find the exit.\u201cWeird.\u201dSu Zimo was back to the original spot again. He stared at the fog in the distance as he brooded.Ji Yaoxue once told him that if one wanted to join the Ethereal Peak, it was far more difficult than joining other sects. Other than having a high grade spirit root, there were many tests to pass. Many high-level Qi Refinement Warriors could not join the Ethereal Peak as well.However, this was exactly what made the Ethereal Peak so attractive to Su Zimo.If it was like the Iridescent Clouds Palace where they only took in disciples based on the different grades of spirit root, Su Zimo felt that this kind of sect had nothing special at all.\u201cI guess I have to put in some effort to join the Ethereal Peak.\u201dSu Zimo vaguely guessed that the thick fog in front of him might be the first test that he had to go through in order to join the Ethereal Peak.If he could not pass this test, he would not be able to see the Ethereal Peak, let alone join the clan.Seeing that it was getting late now, Su Zimo decided to find a place to rest for the night and to think of ways to get through the maze before he decided what to do tomorrow morning.The thick fog in front of him must be there for a reason. It was useless to barge around without a plan.Not far away was a small village. A woman was preparing dinner while a strong man was chopping some wood. A hunter carried his prey on his way home, and two elders squatted at the entrance of the village, a table right in front of them, playing chess on the chessboard. Children from the village were playing and running about.This was a happy and pleasant scene.Su Zimo could feel a sense of warmth at this scene. There was a smile on his face as he took quick steps toward the village.\u201cGrandpa, I am Su Zimo, from the Country of Yan. I don\u2019t have a place to stay for the night. Can I stay at your place for a night?\u201d Su Zimo reached the entrance of the village, making a bow as he asked the two elders who were playing chess.The two elders did not seem to have heard him. They were engrossed in the game and they could not be distracted.Su Zimo coughed softly and repeated his question.The two elders still did not reply to him. They each held a chess piece, as they stared intently at the chessboard. They would make a move occasionally, looking very serious.Su Zimo felt awkward.Since the two elders did not respond, it would be rude if Su Zimo rashly entered the village.Su Zimo smiled and turned to leave.Given his abilities, he could sleep in the open. It would not be a problem to him.The reason why he wanted to stay for a night in the village was because Su Zimo could feel a sense of warmth that he had not felt for ages.Just when Su Zimo was about to leave, his eyes inadvertently rested on the chessboard of the two elders and he stopped in his tracks.This was an intense game. The two parties were in a stalemate. Even the slightest mistake in every move might cost them the game.Since Su Zimo had nothing else to do, he decided to watch them finish the game before he left. Therefore he stood by the side to watch them as they played.Fast Passes and Coins which were spent between 14 Jan\u201314 Feb 2020 will be refunded beginning 15 Feb 2020, taking 7 working days to be deposited.A new round of Trial Read selections will begin on 15 Feb 2020.

    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Breaking Through The FogPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay<b>Translator:</b>\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0<b>Editor:</b>\u00a0Atlas StudiosAfter a long while, the game ended.The elder who was defeated waved his hands, disinterested, mumbling to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good today. I will let you win today, let\u2019s play another game tomorrow.\u201dThe elder placed his hands behind his back, with his palms facing upward, walking leisurely back to the village.The remaining elder had rosy cheeks and looked energetic. He picked up the chessboard, while looking at Su Zimo, smiling as he said, \u201cThere are very few young men who are as composed as you. Let\u2019s go, follow me to the village.\u201d\u201cThank you, grandpa.\u201dSu Zimo smiled, expressed his gratitude and followed the elder into the village.On the way, Su Zimo passed by several villagers. They gave him a glance before returning to whatever they were doing. They did not find it odd, they seemed to have become inured to the unusual.\u201cThere is no extra room here. Young man, are you okay with sleeping in the woodshed?\u201d The elder asked.\u201cI am okay with that.\u201d Su Zimo smiled as he answered.The sky had darkened and most of the villagers had yet to turn in for the night. The elders who had their dinner took leisurely strolls in the village, while the women did their needlework, mending clothes.They led a down-to-earth, simple, and peaceful life.This seemed to be a hidden land of peace and prosperity. There were no bloody fights, instead everyone seemed to carry a content smile on their faces.Su Zimo sat down at the entrance of the woodshed, watching the scene quietly. He emptied his mind of all thoughts and the fatigue he felt on the journey seemed to have lightened tremendously.The sky gradually darkened. The moon was bright and there were few stars.The elderly, the women and the men had returned to their rooms to rest, except for some energetic and bubbly children who were still playing around on the street, refusing to go home to sleep.Su Zimo stood up, returned to the woodshed and closed the door getting ready to sleep.Just then, he heard the bright and sweet voice of a young child coming from the village.\u201cWhere shall one find the traces of the immortal? Looking far into the distance of the Ethereal Peak, it was deep in the mountains where the thick clouds were.\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo had an idea. He turned, pushed the door open and went in the direction of the voice.Not far away, was a seven or eight-year-old child. The child smiled and jumped, moving in his direction.Su Zimo thought for a while before he walked forward. He squatted and asked with a smile on his face, \u201cYoung child, you were saying something just now. Whom did you hear it from?\u201d\u201cWho said it?\u201dThe child bent their head to the side and blinked, looking confused. \u201cI have no idea. But all of us know it.\u201d\u201cIs it just a nursery rhyme?\u201d Su Zimo mused.\u201cBig brother, are you interested in immortal cultivation?\u201d The child continued to ask.\u201cYes.\u201d Su Zimo nodded and smiled. \u201cHow do you know?\u201dThere was a flicker of craftiness in the child\u2019s eyes. The child stuck out the tongue. \u201cEvery year there will be many people like you. But most of them won\u2019t get to see the immortals. Haha.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do to see them?\u201d Su Zimo was interested, feeling like teasing the child.\u201cI don\u2019t know as well.\u201d The child pouted their lips and shook their head.Su Zimo smiled faintly. He was just about to stand up to leave when a thought flashed across his mind. He asked the child. \u201cWhere shall one find the traces of the immortal? Looking far into the distance of the Ethereal Peak. However, the Ethereal Peak is covered by thick fog. How can one be able to see it?\u201d\u201cThis is easy.\u201dThe child raised the chin feeling proud. \u201cThe fog will gradually disperse a few days later. If you stand here, one can vaguely see the mountain peak. However, it will only last for three days. If you miss it, you won\u2019t be able to see it.\u201dSu Zimo was elated.As long as he could see the Ethereal Peak, and moved forward in its direction, he would definitely be able to reach the foot of the mountain.Su Zimo certainly did not think that he only needed to pass through the thick fog to be able to join the Ethereal Peak. This was just the beginning.Su Zimo stayed in the village for seven days.On the seventh day, the thick fog gradually dispersed and he could vaguely see a majestic and towering mountain looming in the distant clouds.Su Zimo bade farewell to everyone in the village and stepped into the thick fog once again.In the thick fog, all the senses had been dulled and one could not have a good sense of direction. Su Zimo felt that after turning eastward and westward, he seemed to be retracing his steps at times.As the thick fog gradually dispersed, he could tell the exact location of the peak in the far distance despite being shrouded in fog.Su Zimo threw caution to the wind and tried to ignore the wrong impression he had because of his senses, moving forward according to the location of the mountain peak.All of a sudden!Gurgling sounds could be heard coming from deep in the fog. It was frightening and eerie. It seemed as if spirit beasts were moving about, stepping on the grass.It was getting closer and closer!A faint bloody smell wafted over him.\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo squinted and stopped, looking in the direction where the sound came from.He waited for a long time but he did not see any spirit beast.It was a strange feeling.Su Zimo did not sense any danger with his spirit perception.However, he had indeed heard the sounds made by the spirit beast and detected its aura coming from that direction. Su Zimo spent one year in Cang Lang Mountain Range. The smell was too familiar. He would never be mistaken about it.\u201cWeird.\u201dSu Zimo murmured and continued to move forward.\u201cRoar!\u201dSoon after, there was a loud tiger growl. It was deafening and it had a formidable aura. It proved that the spirit beast was very powerful. It could even be of the same level as a spirit demon!Su Zimo frowned.Logically speaking, if there was a powerful spirit beast or spirit demon in front of him, Su Zimo should be able to sense the danger with his spirit perception.However, strangely his spirit perception could not detect anything, while his senses kept telling him that there was danger.In this case, there could only be two possibilities.The surrounding fog had shrouded Su Zimo\u2019s spirit perception or that it had confused his five senses.The answer was obvious.These methods were meant to scare off those who wanted to take the path of immortal cultivation or those who were weak-minded.The tiger growl and the bloody smell were just methods to deceive people.After figuring out the purpose of the thick fog, Su Zimo smile and ignored all the sounds that he heard from the surroundings, walking deeper into the fog without any care.Nevertheless, it was a brilliant move to make use of the thick fog to confuse one\u2019s senses.If Su Zimo did not have spirit perception, he would be trembling in fear and taking careful steps along the way.Su Zimo gradually sped up and he walked out of the thick fog in no time. Everything became clear in front of him.As far as the eyes could see, there were verdant and lush vegetation, clear waters and green hills. It was full of vitality. He felt as if he was in the immortal world.There was a stone gate not too far away.At the back of the stone gate was a mountain road that was paved with green stones. The path winded around the mountain and led all the way to the deep, dark end of the fog.On the two sides of the stone gate stood two young smart-looking children who cultivated Dao. One of them was plump while the other was thin.At the sight of Su Zimo, the plump child smiled and nodded. \u201cYoung Master, you are the first to reach. Please wait here. We will only open the gate and accept disciples three days later.\u201dSu Zimo was not in a hurry. He waited by the side silently.Many people kept coming out from the fog. Most of them were mortals who had not been cultivating. They looked pale and beads of perspiration could be seen on their forehead. It seemed that they were scared stiff during the journey.Some of them were Qi Refinement Warriors who maneuvered flying swords to break out of the fog. They breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing the stone gate.A few Qi Refinement Warriors swept their gaze over Su Zimo. They relaxed slightly upon knowing that he had no spirit qi.Some Qi Refinement Warriors took a glance at the bow and saber that Su Zimo had with him and sneered. They could not help but smirk.There were people from all walks of life.Three days passed in no time.Fast Passes and Coins which were spent between 14 Jan\u201314 Feb 2020 will be refunded beginning 15 Feb 2020, taking 7 working days to be deposited.A new round of Trial Read selections will begin on 15 Feb 2020.

Most of them were mortals who had not cultivated before and there were a couple dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors.Once the three days had passed, the fog behind them turned murkier and impenetrable.Even if anyone outside wanted to join Ethereal Peak, they could only wait for the next year by now.Notwithstanding the 500 odd people waiting outside the stone gate, even the two children could not really conceal their fatigue after the three days as they stood there chatting idly.\u201cSenior brother, how many of these people do you think can get to join the sect?\u201d\u201cFive at most.\u201dThrough that vast forest, the sound of birds singing and running water was all around. As such, the discussion of the two children was almost like mosquito buzzing and no one could hear them.Yet, within the crowd, a bow and saber carrying scholar frowned as a look of shock flashed through his eyes.Cultivating The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness did not merely change one\u2019s body. The Body Tempering aspect would heighten their sense of smell; the Tendons Transformation aspect their sense of vision and the Bones Strengthening aspect their hearing.The changes were all encompassing.Even though Su Zimo was of the Human race, his physical body and five senses were even sharper than those of Spirit Beasts!Despite the soft voices of the two children, Su Zimo heard everything clear as day.Only five out of the 500 of them could be accepted into the sect!That was a ratio of 1:100! How could anyone imagine that?Su Zimo had initially thought that he would be able to enter Ethereal Peak with ease with his borrowed Heaven spirit root. But now, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t just rely on that!The conditions for one to be able to join Ethereal Peak must be extremely stringent or there wouldn\u2019t be so many people eliminated!Just as Su Zimo was contemplating on what he should do, he heard the two children continue.\u201cWho do you think stands a greater chance, senior brother?\u201d\u201cThe couple that doesn\u2019t really seem to fit in. Even though they\u2019re only at Level 5 Qi Condensation, they look like they have an extraordinary aura. They\u2019re decent. Oh, that little fatty too. He looks rather sharp so he should be fine. Junior brother, he\u2019s even fatter than you! Hehe!\u201dSu Zimo swept his gaze at him.Amongst the crowd, a man and woman stood by their own somewhere slightly further, not fitting in with the crowd.Su Zimo was around the same age as the man who wore a purple robe with sharp brows and an edged chin. He looked haughty as his hands rested behind his back with eyes closed, standing still. It looked as though he was one with the environment.The woman was wearing a flawless white blouse and looked beautiful like a fairy. Yet, her ravishing looks carried a cold expression where one could sense from a distance away.Su Zimo had a feeling that the reason why the man did not want to fit in was out of disdain and the woman merely did not want to.As for the little fatty\u2026To be exact, he was not little at all and looked to be around 16 years old. His neck and waist could not be made out and he merely resembled a water bucket that had two elephant legs as he rolled about the crowd without stopping.His rotund face carried small beady eyes that fluttered about. In just three days, he was already one with the crowd.\u201cSenior brother, what about that bow and saber carrying scholar? Do you think he has a chance?\u201d The fat child asked.Su Zimo was curious when he heard the conversation being steered to him, intrigued to find out what the skinny child thought of him.\u201cThat man\u2026 is a little strange. Even though he\u2019s a scholar, he\u2019s carrying a huge bow and saber. I suspect that there must be more to his weapons.\u201dRight then, a gentle ray of sun shone through the greenery.The sun had risen.Arranging their attire, the two children stood on either side of the stone gate with a stern expression. The skinny child spoke, \u201cEthereal Peak\u2019s disciple acceptance consists of three stages. First is the Immortal Affinity Stage. There is a certain affinity required for one to attain immortality. I believe that all of you have that for being able to make it through the mist here.\u201d\u201cThe second stage is the Spirit Testing Stage. Those with a superior-class spirit root, Earth spirit root or Heaven spirit root will be able to make it to the third stage once they pass through this gate.\u201d\u201cThe third stage is called the Life and Death Stage. Those who the second stage can head up the stone steps behind me and you\u2019ll pass once you reach the peak. But let me remind you guys, this is an extremely treacherous peak. Any misstep and you\u2019ll fall to your death without a corpse. Please do be careful and not force yourselves.\u201dAt that thought, everyone felt their hearts skip a beat as they all looked unnerved.The reason why they wanted to join Ethereal Peak was because they wanted to attain immortality. If they were to lose their lives joining the sect, how could they achieve immortality?The tip of the peak was shrouded in clouds and could not be seen.It was clear that the path would not be that easy to climb.The dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors present smiled, looking confident.All of them could tread the skies with their swords. Climbing the peak posed no challenge to them at all.Amongst the group, one of the mortals was dissident as he yelled, \u201cHow is this fair? All of those Qi Refinement Warriors can easily fly their way to the peak but we have to climb it step by step!\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201dOne of the Qi Refinement Warriors harrumphed coldly and scoffed, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing such as fairness in this world. If you want to speak of fairness, come to me after you achieve Qi Condensation!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d The mortal was speechless and indignant.The two children of the Ethereal Sect were not annoyed in the slightest as the fat one chuckled. \u201cEveryone, you\u2019re overthinking it. The path is definitely fair for everyone. Even Qi Refinement Warriors will not, no, may not be able to reach the peak. If they\u2019re not careful, they\u2019ll end up losing their lives as well!\u201dAs though he was about to let something slip, the fat child looked flustered for a moment as he changed his statement.Most people merely thought that the fat child had said something wrong by accident.At that reply, many of the mortals present heaved a sigh of relief.However, the dozens of Qi Refinement Warriors looked terrible.They had cultivated earnestly with some of them even at Level 9 Qi Condensation. If they were to die here just because they wanted to join a sect\u2026Su Zimo glanced sideways.The purple robed haughty man still had his eyes closed as though he was indifferent to what the two children had said.The white bloused woman maintained her cold expression with an unyielding gaze that seemed to be frozen.The little fatty among the crowd was still laughing and looking nonchalant.\u201cCome, the first person,\u201d The skinny child raised his hand and indicated for the first person to enter the stone gate.It was a Level 7 Qi Refinement Warrior.The man was somewhat nervous as he paused before the stone gate. Bowing to the two children, he smiled and asked, \u201cFellow Daoists, can an ordinary spirit root work? Is there any leeway?\u201dThe two children shook their heads.Sighing, the man walked towards the stone gate.The moment he reached the stone gate, a water barrier appeared across it with four shimmering lights.Four elements \u2013 it was an ordinary spirit root!The man tried his best to barge through the stone gate but he was blocked by the water barrier. In the blink of an eye, he was bounced back from it.Failure!The fat child looked apologetic as he nodded to the man before raising his voice to the crowd, \u201cNext.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Boom! Boom!The water barrier turned yellow right away before materializing slowly into a sturdy mud wall.Earth element, Heaven spirit root!Out of the 500 over applicants, there was finally a Heaven spirit root!The two children nodded to the little fatty with a kind smile, their eyes sparkling.As he crossed the stone gate with ease, he came to the two children with smiles and pulled their hands together like long lost friends. Casually, he started engaging the both of them in conversation.Both of them were a little stunned and they nearly spilled everything about themselves within a few mere sentences.At that sight, Su Zimo smirked internally \u2013 that little fatty looked to be amiable and cute from the outside, but her was sharper than any of them.Before long, the skinny child was the first one to recover as he coughed gently and swung the little fatty\u2019s chubby hand away and said in a deep voice, \u201cFellow Daoist, please respect yourself and wait at the side instead of distracting us.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Self respect. I understand that I\u2019ve got a huge self to respect,\u201d The little fatty giggled without looking awkward at all.The skinny child rolled his eyes and got rid of the little fatty before yelling toward the stone gate, \u201cNext!\u201dSomeone tried and failed once more.The number of people remaining was diminishing.Finally, the haughty man opened his eyes as he turned to look at the white bloused woman not too far away. Giving a slight grin, he headed for the stone gate.His actions attracted everyone\u2019s attention.It was as though he was a born ruler where every single move he made would attract the gazes of the masses.The little fatty stopped smiling and looked at the stone gate.Frowning slightly, the white bloused woman raised her head and her eyes followed the haughty man coldly too.The haughty man stopped himself before the stone gate where the water barrier showed no indication of color.\u201cHehe.\u201dAfter a temporary silence, giggles spread from the crowd.\u201cWhat\u2019s he putting a show on for when he doesn\u2019t even have a spirit root?\u201d\u201cI know, right? And here I was thinking that he was someone incredible.\u201d\u201cWait, something\u2019s not right. How did he become a Qi Refinement Warrior without a spirit root\u2026\u201dThe moment that sentence was spoken, everyone fell silent.It was as though an invisible hand had gripped the covered the mouths of the mocking crowd as they watched with agape eyes.The two children had a stern expression as well.The little fatty was in deep thoughts. As though he had realized something, his chubby body shivered slightly as he could not contain his shock.Oo! Oo!Right then, a bizarre howling sound came out of the stone gate as the water barrier shimmered, looking like a breeze had just passed through it.\u201cWind element, variant spirit root!\u201dThe two children yelped.When he heard that, Su Zimo\u2019s heart skipped a beat too.Of the five types of spirit roots, the Heaven spirit root was the best and rarest. However, there was a single spirit root that was even rarer than that \u2013 the variant spirit root, containing elements such as wind, thunder, ice, light and darkness et cetera.One could say that a Heaven spirit root could only be found in one out of 10,000 men. Yet, a variant spirit root was tenfold rarer than that.Naturally, a variant spirit root only had a single element as well and was a type of Heaven spirit root. However, that did not mean that it was stronger than the usual five elements; it was just extremely rare.The haughty man smiled and crossed the stone gate with ease.Excitedly, the skinny child whispered, \u201cJunior brother, stand guard over here. I\u2019ll go inform the peak master and be right back.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Hurry on, senior brother,\u201d The fat child replied hastily.Right then, the white bloused woman outside the stone gate moved as well.\u201cHold on, senior brother. We can wait till this one\u2019s done too,\u201d The fat Dao child called back the skinny one.Nodding his head, the skinny child watched the white bloused woman keenly, seemingly even more nervous than her.When she arrived before the stone gate, there was no color on the water barrier still.This time round, no one dared to mock anymore.\u201cCould it be another variant spirit root?\u201d The eyes of both children widened in disbelief.Everyone else watched the stone gate with bated breath.Crack! Crack! Crack!Suddenly, a layer of frost covered the water barrier before freezing it into ice!\u201cIce element, variant spirit root!\u201dEveryone gasped.\u201cIt\u2019s been tens of years since a variant spirit root has appeared at Ethereal Peak! But now, there\u2019s two in one go? No, I\u2019ve got to hurry and report it to the peak master!\u201dThe skinny child drew out a flying sword and sped towards the back of the peak, disappearing in the blink of an eye.Everyone else watched the haughty man and the white bloused woman with looks of admiration and respect.The little fatty smiled his way to the white bloused woman before pandering to her, \u201cMiss, you\u2019re so beautiful. I\u2019ve never seen a woman as beautiful as you in my life. You\u2019re even prettier than our village beauty, Sister Caifeng!\u201dIt was as though thunder had struck everyone present as they rolled their eyes.That little fatty really did dare to say anything with drivel such as his village beauty, Sister Caifeng and whatnot.He wasn\u2019t wrong in his words \u2013 the white bloused woman was indeed extremely beautiful. However, most people would not dare to spout such truths, let alone in front of her.Yet, the strange thing was that everything seemed natural and sincere when they came out of the little fatty\u2019s mouth without a single bit of awkwardness.If any other women heard such an open and brazen compliment, they would definitely feel shy. However, the girl was unmoved as she glared at the little fatty coldly without saying anything.The little fatty wasn\u2019t dissuaded as he slipped away to the haughty man\u2019s side before commenting in awe, \u201cSir, you have such a good figure. I\u2019m really envious!\u201d\u201cGet away!\u201dThe haughty man\u2019s lips pursed slightly as he spat out those two words.\u201cAh, alright!\u201dThe little fatty nodded his head keenly as he disregarded cleanliness and rolled away on the floor immediately!Because his figure resembled a ball to begin with, his rolling motion indeed made him look less than human.The white bloused woman\u2019s lips twitched as her frostiness diminished slightly, watching with a trace of bemusement.Spying her expression with his sharp eyes, the little fatty stumbled over to the white bloused woman\u2019s side with an intoxicated expression. His eyes seemed as though they were sparkling as he praised, \u201cWow, you really look so beautiful smiling!\u201dInstantly, the friendliness in the girl\u2019s eyes disappeared. However, she stretched out her delicate hand and patted on the little fatty\u2019s head, neither harshly nor gently.Smiling with squinted eyes, the little fatty looked to be enjoying it.\u201cHow could there be someone this shameless?!\u201d Those were the words that passed through everyone\u2019s minds.When the fat child looked at the remaining tens of people and saw nothing special about them, he waved his hand patiently and demanded, \u201cContinue with the test. Hurry up.\u201dSu Zimo tidied his clothes before heading up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though Die Yue had planted the spirit root for him, he could not help but feel nervous as to whether things would turn out well.Standing still before the stone gate, he watched the water barrier keenly.Swoosh!A red flash of light shimmered through the water barrier before burning into raging flames, exuding a scorching warmth.Su Zimo was elated.Fire element, heaven spirit root!Apart from the haughty man and white bloused woman, everyone turned their sights to him.Out of the 500 people, other than the two variant spirit roots, the little fatty was the only Earth element heaven spirit root. Now that Su Zimo was the second, he naturally attracted everyone\u2019s attention.Furthermore, those with some knowledge on cultivation knew that a Fire spirit root was superior to an Earth spirit root.On the one hand, the Fire element had the highest killing power amongst the five elements.On the other hand, one who possessed the Fire element had the chance to become a Weapon or Elixir Refinement Master.Those two paths required one to have a high mastery and understanding of the Fire element. As such, those with a Fire spirit root had an innate advantage.Waiting with a hawk eye by the stone gate, the little fatty was hoping to make his acquaintance as well after Su Zimo passed through it.\u201cEh?\u201dThe fat Dao child was standing at the side idly as he let out a casual surprised remark. Smiling, he then nodded and said, \u201cNot bad, not bad. Come on over, sir.\u201dAfter all, the fat child had his fill of surprises after the appearance of two consecutive variant spirit roots and hence the reason for his less than enthused response.Right then, no one had noticed anything strange about Su Zimo just yet.He stood before the stone gate motionlessly instead of crossing right away.It wasn\u2019t that he did not want to \u2013 the stone gate was stopping him.He could feel a strong resistance that was trying to keep him out of the gate!In theory, the water barrier would only block out those without or those who possess a pseudo and ordinary spirit root. Yet, the scarlet water barrier was resisting Su Zimo who clearly possessed a heaven spirit root.If not for the fact that he had an extremely strong physique, he would have been sent flying like the first Qi Refinement Warrior.\u201cHow could this be?\u201dSu Zimo strategized as he fought against the resistance of the water barrier.He knew his background clearer than anyone else.He was someone without a spirit root to begin with.It was only natural for the stone gate to resist him at that thought.But, what was up with the clear indication of his Fire spirit root?If he were to continue with this stalemate, notwithstanding the fat child of Ethereal Sect, even everyone else would realize that something was wrong and Su Zimo\u2019s efforts would have been wasted.Indignant!Su Zimo was indignant!Why?He had already come so far just to be stopped by a single stone gate!With a darkened expression, he moved towards the water barrier and took a fierce step!Su Zimo had already displayed the stance for the Plow Heaven Stride with his single step. Instantly, he gave off such a menacing aura that even the fat child at the stone gate jumped in shock.\u201cMmm?\u201dAs though he had sensed something, the haughty man opened his eyes and looked towards the stone gate.Turning her head slightly, the white bloused woman frowned gently too.Everyone found themselves witnessing the strangest scene ever.Even though Su Zimo was almost entirely through the stone gate, the scarlet water barrier did not dissipate at all. Instead, it wrapped around him like an elastic veil that was trying its best to stop him.It stunned everyone present.What was going on?Fire element, heaven spirit root. That\u2019s right.But, why would the stone gate try to prevent this man?It was a wrestle between Su Zimo and the scarlet water barrier.All of a sudden!Squinting his eyes, Su Zimo\u2019s body rang out with crackling sounds and his entire body seemed as though it had enlarged. With his tendons and bones cracking together, he gave a soft yell and strode out once more!Swoosh!The water barrier shattered and fell to the ground.Having successfully passed the stone gate, Su Zimo\u2019s expression relaxed as he heaved out a sigh of relief before walking to the fat child.Right as he was about to speak, he saw a weird look in the fat child\u2019s eye as the latter glared behind him intently.Snap!Suddenly, a boom sounded out from behind Su Zimo.He turned around instinctively only to witness a fissure forming on the crossbeam of the mighty 30 foot stone gate!Crack! Crack! Crack!Before anyone realized what was going on, the fissure spread out swiftly and in the blink of an eye, filled the entire stone gate with dense, horrifying cracks!Su Zimo\u2019s heart skipped a beat.Bang! Boom! Boom!Along with a huge crash, the stone gate crumbled right before everyone\u2019s eyes just like that, turning into a pile of rocks with dust clouds flying about.What followed was a deathly silence.Everyone\u2019s faces froze right away.The haughty man scowled while a look of surprise filled the white bloused woman\u2019s face as her mouth gaped slightly, losing her previous demeanor.The little fatty was so rattled that his eyeballs were almost popping out.\u201cE-E-Exploded?!\u201dThe fat child was completely lost as his mind and eyes went blank.It was already phenomenal enough for variant spirit roots to make their appearance in the test such that his senior brother had gone off to inform their peak master about it.But, what was up with this scholar before him!He had caused the entire stone gate to explode with a simple spirit root test\u2026!Unnerved, Su Zimo coughed gently before revealing a friendly smile to the fat child. \u201cFellow daoist, I suppose that stone gate must be really old, huh?\u201d\u201cA-Ah! Yes!\u201d The fat child replied automatically, \u201cIt\u2019s been a couple thousand years now.\u201d\u201cThat must be it then.\u201dSu Zimo nodded his head and continued solemnly, \u201cIt\u2019s only natural for problems to arise since the gate has been here for such a long time enduring the weather all round the year. How unfortunate that I had to come across its demise.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The fat child\u2019s jaw almost dropped to the ground.Su Zimo patted the fat child on the shoulder and reminded sincerely, \u201cThis may not be a bad thing though. At least, it serves as a reminder for the sect to conduct constant maintenance to some of the older structures you guys have so that today\u2019s situation does not repeat itself. These issues have to be nipped in the bud before they are allowed to manifest.\u201dThe fat child was befuddled to begin with through the confusion. With Su Zimo\u2019s explanation, he was even more astounded and was almost convinced.In reality, the stone gate was initially a gigantic spirit testing stone with its middle dug out by the cultivators of Ethereal Sect and placed here, turning into the stone gate they perceive today.The spirit testing stone was a spirit item of the universe and was extremely perceptive to spirit roots \u2013 there was no way it would be destroyed through a lack of maintenance.If no one had destroyed it, it could have lasted for even millions of years without any issues.The little fatty was the first to react as his eyes flickered, glancing at Su Zimo while raising a thumbs up.He knew that he was not at Su Zimo\u2019s level where the latter could spout nonsense with a straight face. As such, he could not help but feel impressed.Su Zimo could not help but feel guilty.Everything had gone beyond his expectations. Even though what he said was akin to duping kids, it was better than having his background exposed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I-I-I\u2026! I\u2019ll go let the peak master know about this too!\u201dShrugging his head as though trying to clear his mind, the fat child patted his storage bag and summoned a flying sword before speeding to the back of the peak.In the blink of an eye, both children guarding this place had disappeared.Unnerved, the fat child had left in a hurry without saying anything else.The little fatty seemed to be extremely interested in Su Zimo. With bright, shimmering eyes, he stumbled over and bowed. \u201cSir, how did you do it! Can you teach me?\u201dWith an unchanging expression, Su Zimo shook his head. \u201cThat\u2026 has nothing to do with me.\u201dEven though he said that, his heart whispered another tune.There were only two reasons why the stone gate blocked him.First, it was because he was a cultivator without a spirit root to begin with.Second, even though it was also a heaven spirit root, the Fire spirit root that Die Yue gave him was different from normal ones.Su Zimo could not tell which of the two reasons it was.After the Spirit Testing Stage, there were only 80 out of the 500 left with more than 20 Qi Refinement Warriors.Based on the order of events, the remaining 80 people should head up the peak through the path beyond the stone gate so that they could proceed with the third stage \u2013 Life and Death.However, with the two children from Ethereal Sect gone, everyone was lost as to whether they should continue with the original plan or wait where they were.Right then, the haughty man chuckled and started ascending the peak.His actions caused everyone to waver.The two children had mentioned earlier that the third stage was merely to head up the peak through the path. However, everyone knew that if they could be the first to reach the peak, their chances of being accepted would be much higher.After the haughty man, the white bloused woman made her move too.Exchanging glances, everyone else followed suit immediately.The path was made from green stones and was neither rugged nor tough. Instead, the journey was picturesque with luscious greenery and the soothing melody of birds singing.As they traversed through the clouds with the accompanying scenery, it was as though they were in paradise; everything felt relaxing unlike a treacherous Life and Death Stage.Su Zimo was in no hurry as he hung around at the back of the pack.He felt that since Ethereal Sect set this stage, it wouldn\u2019t be to give the first person who reached the peak an advantage.It was way too cliche and wasn\u2019t a fair method given the number of people present. Finally, if it was that simple, it wouldn\u2019t be named Life and Death Stage.After Su Zimo destroyed the entire stone gate for a mere test, the little fatty was now hanging around him instead of the haughty man and the white bloused woman, chatting non-stop the entire way.Worried that he may let his background slip, Su Zimo was rather distracted as he only replied casually every now and then.\u201cBro, everyone went through the spirit root testing so ordinarily. But your test was like a fart to Mother Nature!\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cBecause it was loud and clear!\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cBro, you seem like you have a dignified demeanor. I suppose you have quite the extraordinary background?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve studied for a couple of years in the past.\u201d\u201cMy, bro! That\u2019s like a rare gem in the crowd! You can both study and fight!\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dSu Zimo finally understood the powers of the little fatty as he hurried ahead, wanting to bury himself into the crowd.Right then, the people up ahead stopped in their tracks.Su Zimo looked up and frowned.That was the end of the mountain path! Everyone found themselves facing a steep peak that extended into the clouds boundlessly.The true test had arrived!The smooth mountain road was merely a warm up!The many mortals present looked up at the peak solemnly.For them, the only way they could reach the top was to climb by hand. However, the peak was simply way too steep that there was barely any edge for them to grab on to.On both sides of the mountain road was a deep abyss where a single misstep would mean certain death!Everyone could not help but recall the words of the children. This was a stage treacherous like no other. Any single mistake and they would find themselves dead without a corpse. Hence, they should be careful and not force themselves.Many of the mortals could not hide their fear in their expression as they gave up internally.There were some who were indignant about things and whispered in discussion.\u201cEthereal Sect is way too much. They\u2019re trying to get us killed just to join them.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? It\u2019s not as though our spirit root is lousy as well. If push comes to shove, we can just join some other sects. That would be better than dying here.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know how high this peak is. What if we climb halfway up and run out of energy?\u201dUnlike the many mortals, the 20 odd Qi Refinement Warriors present looked relaxed.While this mountain may seem insurmountable to mortals, all they had to do was ride their flying swords and rise endlessly.One of the Qi Refinement Warriors pulled out a flying sword from his storage bag and with a single leap, he chuckled with a suave expression. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll make a move first and await you guys at the peak.\u201dRight after, he soared into the skies and disappeared into the clouds in the blink of an eye.Not willing to lose out, the other Qi Refinement Warriors took out their spirit weapons and followed suit.Yet, the strange thing was that the haughty man did not move at all. Instead, he frowned and gazed into the clouds, contemplating about something.It was the same for the white bloused woman as she stood there in deep thoughts.Some of the mortals gathered their courage and began climbing the peak. Compared to the Qi Refinement Warriors, they were much slower and every single step was horrifying.A single misstep and they would fall right into the abyss!\u201cBro, aren\u2019t you moving?\u201d The little fatty looked at Su Zimo.Right as he was about to reply, a shriek rang out from the clouds.\u201cAh!\u201dEveryone\u2019s hearts skipped a beat.In the blink of an eye, a shadow fell from the clouds and glided through everyone\u2019s vision into the dark abyss beneath!At that sight, everyone\u2019s expressions turned grim as chills ran down their spines.The person who had fallen was the Qi Refinement Warrior who had moved first!A Qi Refinement Warrior was dead just like that?What had he encountered up there?The clouds rumbled and shifted, emanating a chilling killing intent.\u201cAh!\u201dIt was yet another shriek.A shadow fluttered by them and dunked into the depths of the abyss.Gulp, gulp.The place rang out with everyone\u2019s gulping sounds.In just a mere short while, two Qi Refinement Warriors had fallen to their deaths!The two children were right. The third stage was fair for everyone such that even Qi Refinement Warriors may not be able to reach the peak.The few mortals that had just started climbing up the peak found themselves getting cold feet as they watched everything unfold in utter horror.There were already people who had started to climb down.What kind of a joke was that? There was no need for them to take such a risk when even Qi Refinement Warriors have died.Suddenly, the haughty man laughed and mumbled. \u201cLife and Death Stage, Life and Death Stage. The peak represents life while the abyss represents death. Interesting! Challenging!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just what did they encounter in the clouds?\u201dSu Zimo saw everything even clearer.There were a total of 23 Qi Refinement Warriors who soared into the skies. In the blink of an eye, every single one of them had fallen!That was a little horrifying.Many mortals started climbing down the walls, looking terrified with trembling feet. Without even turning back, they dashed down the mountain path.There were more than 80 people who had passed the second stage. Now, all the 23 Qi Refinement Warriors have already failed. Coupled with the mortals who had left, there were only 17 people left at the base of the peak.All of the 17 were resolute warriors who did not show the slightest look of fear in their eyes even at the sight of all those Qi Refinement Warriors falling over.Even the little fatty who was chattering the entire way merrily had gone silent, his beady eyes fluttering about as he was deep in thoughts.Su Zimo had always felt something unusual about this stage as everything seemed suspicious.However, he could not point out just what exactly was wrong.At almost the same time, both the haughty man and white bloused woman summoned a flying sword and soared to the skies. However, their speed was clearly slower \u2013 it was clear that both of them were being wary about the situation as well.\u201cBro, remember to be careful. I\u2019ll scout the way for you first,\u201d The little fatty was also a Qi Refinement Warrior as he retrieved a small shield from his storage bag. The shield expanded with the wind and carried his rotund body into the skies slowly.The remaining 14 people inclusive of Su Zimo were mortals who had no spirit qi within them.If they wanted to ascend the peak, they would have to climb the peak step by step physically.Su Zimo hesitated no more as he approached the base of the peak. With a nimble leap, he hung onto the walls and started climbing up swiftly.That shocked the remaining 13 people as they almost mistook him for a monkey instead of a human climbing the peak.By now, Su Zimo had almost perfected his Tendons Transformation. He was nimble like a python and agile like an ape. Moving with ease, the peak posed no challenge to him at all.Apes were natural born climbers.If Su Zimo had given it his all, even Qi Refinement Warriors who could soar through the skies may not even be able to match his speed.Previously at the Cang Lang Mountain Range, even when Elder Qian of Joyful Clan soared through the skies, Su Zimo\u2019s speed while climbing the towering old tree matched his!Of course, Su Zimo had used his Sanguine Ape Transformation at that time and Elder Qian was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator.Even without using all his strength, Su Zimo had left the 13 remaining mortals far behind his tail.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dRight then, Su Zimo vaguely picked up on some birds crying out.Even though he had lived a year in Cang Lang Mountain Range, he still could not understand the language of beasts. However, he could tell of how they felt through their sounds.Those birds clearly sounded happy and mocking.\u201cWhy are there spirit beasts here?\u201dHe frowned as he continued climbing without slowing down at all.\u201cBastard, how dare you!\u201dBefore long, the voice of the haughty man hollered out above.Su Zimo raised his head and gazed over, squinting his eyes.Far beyond the clouds, a gigantic bird was extending its wings while cawing out with a raised head. Su Zimo could faintly make out the bird assaulting the haughty man, white bloused woman and little fatty in midair.Every single gentle flap of its wings brought about a hurricane as all three of them swayed back and forth midair, looking as though they could fall anytime.\u201cA spirit demon?\u201dSu Zimo was stunned.The bird exuded an aura that was the same as spirit demons.It looked as though it had just become a spirit demon, equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.Even then, its strength was enough to hold out against the three of them.It was clear that the bird had not used its full strength. Instead, it was running circles around the three of them like a cat circling a rat, flapping its wings from time to time so that none of them could ascend further.The haughty man had a Wind spirit root to begin with and thus was barely able to maintain his balance despite swaying in the wind.The white bloused woman had a frozen expression. She was encased by a transparent ice barrier \u2013 it was clear that she had already used a talisman.As for the little fatty, his shield was steady and spacious. He sprawled on it, gripping onto its edges tightly with sweat pouring down his puffy face, looking all nervous.\u201cSo, this is the obstacle of the Life and Death Stage. One would be able to reach the peak if they could get through this bird.\u201dNow that he understood the reason, Su Zimo was prepared to continue climbing. Right then, the little fatty shrieked.Perhaps because the bird saw that Su Zimo and the others were approaching as well, it seemed as though it no longer wanted to waste time as it flapped its wings furiously.The little fatty was the first one to lose control as he fell from midair with his shield blown into oblivion.\u201cAHHHHHHH!\u201dHis face was pale as a sheet as he flailed his arms, crying out loudly. When he caught sight of Su Zimo above him, he called, \u201cBro, run! There\u2019s a fierce bird up there!\u201dThe place where the little fatty fell was not too far away from Su Zimo.Su Zimo had a decent impression of the little fatty and was not about to leave the latter in the lurch. With a swift motion, he strode horizontally across the wall and grabbed the little fatty from midair.By then, the little fatty\u2019s eyes were rolled over while he drooled all over, seemingly passed out of fear.Su Zimo frowned.He was already halfway through the climb. If he were to put the little fatty down, he would have to repeat an entire journey once more.Even though the little fatty was heavy, he was nothing compared to the Cold Moon Saber and Sanguine Crystal Bow hanging on his waist.At that thought, Su Zimo grabbed the little fatty with one arm while continuing to climb with another without slowing down at all.It was only after he got closer that he managed to make things out clearly.It was a crane that looked to be in its infancy stage, its eyes filled with merry excitement.It was as though making the climbers fall was the most fun game it ever played.Swooping down, the crane extended its claws and landed on the white bloused woman\u2019s talisman ice barrier.Crack! Crack!The barrier began cracking as the crane clawed at it with ease.With a strong gust of wind, the woman then fell from her sword. Even though her gaze looked slightly dim, she did not make a single peep of disgruntlement as she disappeared into the abyss.The haughty man followed soon after, holding out for not much longer under the attacks of the crane as he fell through the skies looking indignant.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dRearing its head, the crane looked extremely gleeful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Digging themselves into the wall of the peak, he continued climbing steadily.The crane had extremely sharp senses. With a swift flap, it appeared above Su Zimo\u2019s head and cried out, looking at him with a taunting expression as though mocking his little play of trying to dodge it.The man and crane had finally met.\u2026On a peak enshrouded with spirit qi elsewhere, two grace middle aged cultivators sat opposite to one another. They were both clad in white robes and one of them had a flying sword emblem engraved on his sleeve while the other had a hexagon emblem.Both of them were sipping tea lazily.Beside them stood a skinny child who was relating something excitedly.\u201cHmms? Variant spirit root? Two of them?\u201dOne of them placed his teacup down and turned around to ask, his expression slightly changed.The skinny child nodded furiously.The other cultivator asked, \u201cWhat spirit roots were they?\u201d\u201cOne is wind and the other is ice.\u201dAt that, the two cultivators exchanged glances and smiled, apparently pleased.\u201cWen Xuan, your peak\u2019s about to produce two more geniuses.\u201dThere were six peaks to Ethereal Peak where the highest amongst them was the true Ethereal Peak that was visible to the outside world.Surrounding it were five other peaks \u2013 Spirit, Elixir, Talisman, Array and Weapon.The cultivator known as Wen Xuan \u2013 the one with a flying sword emblem embossed \u2013 was the peak master of Spirit Peak.The other person was Xuan Yi, peak master of Array Peak.Naturally, anyone who could be a peak master was definitely a Perfected Golden Core.Even though all the peaks had their specialties, Spirit Peak was the strongest amongst them with the most disciples. Because they valued cultivation realms the most highly, everything they learned and imparted were killing techniques.If there were variant and heaven spirit roots, they would most likely be selected by Spirit Peak.Wen Xuan smiled and stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go take a look and see how many tribulations of the Life and Death Stage those two can pass.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Those with variant spirit roots are blessed by providence. They\u2019ll naturally be able to pass the tribulation of life and death,\u201d A teasing expression flickered by the eyes of Peak Master Xuan Yi as he joked, \u201cLook how anxious you are. Where\u2019s your poise as a peak master?\u201d\u201cCome, join me to take a look.\u201dWith a hearty laugh, Wen Xuan tugged at Xuan Yi\u2019s wrist and wanted to leave together.Shaking his head, Xuan Yi ducked away and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not going. Won\u2019t I be giving myself troubles by watching your Spirit Peak take all the good talents away?\u201dRight then, a chubby fat child ran over in a huff.\u201cP-Peak master! T-T-This is bad!\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dBoth peak masters exchanged glances, looking surprised.\u201cWhy are you here too, junior brother?\u201d The skinny child asked.Sweating from head to toe, the fat child waved his lumpy hand and cried out, \u201cPeak master, the spirit testing gate exploded!\u201d\u201cExploded?\u201dXuan Yi and Wen Xuan looked at one another confused.Wen Xuan asked, \u201cWhy would it explode? Someone destroyed it?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe fat child shook his head before nodding fervently. \u201cYes! Wait, no. No!\u201dBoth peak masters were thoroughly confused.\u201cJust what in the world happened! Speak properly!\u201d Wen Xuan hollered with a solemn expression.The fat child could not help but recall the words of that scholar. Instinctively, he repeated, \u201cIt might be because the spirit testing gate had been enduring the rough weather for such a long time without proper maintenance, that\u2019s why it broke apart\u2026\u201dBam!Wen Xuan flicked the fat child on the head.\u201cOw!\u201dClutching his head, he pursed his lips sadly.\u201cWhat nonsense.\u201dXuan Yi could not hide his smile as he chuckled. \u201cWho taught you that? I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t think up that on your own, right?\u201d\u201cA scholar told me that,\u201d The fat child replied, \u201cBut I think what he said makes sense too. And he was even kind enough to have me remind the sect to take care of our old structures so that\u2026\u201dBam!Yet another flick.Instantly, a big, swollen bump appeared on the forehead of the fat child.He was almost bursting into tears as he asked with teary eyes, \u201cPeak master, why are you hitting me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too silly, child. One day, you might even end up counting money for the man who sells you out,\u201d Xuan Yi did not know to laugh or to cry.Wen Xuan spoke sternly, \u201cTell me the entire series of events. Do not hide anything from me.\u201d\u201cThere was this scholar carrying a bow and saber. He came before the spirit testing gate and it displayed a Fire spirit root,\u201d The fat child answered.\u201cCarry on.\u201d\u201cBut, the spirit testing gate did not allow him to enter. The scholar then continued barging through and the spirit testing gate exploded.\u201dWen Xuan and Xuan Yi frowned and exchanged glances, still confused.Wen Xuan asked right away, \u201cAre you sure it was a Fire spirit root?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe fat child replied instantly, \u201cPeak master, you\u2019ve got to believe me! Even though I\u2019m stupid, I can still tell that it\u2019s a Fire spirit root!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d Xuan Yi could not figure out what happened.After a moment of silence, Xuan Yi spoke, \u201cWen Xuan, I\u2019ll accompany you to see just what is up with this scholar.\u201dWithout the use of any spirit weapons, the both of them soared through the skies and with a flip of their robes, carried the two children with them towards the front of the peak.Before long, all four of them arrived at where the spirit testing gate was.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed broken.\u201dXuan Yi stared at the lump of rocks beneath him where the spirit testing gate once stood and murmured silently.Wen Xuan asked, \u201cWhere is that scholar?\u201d\u201cEh? He\u2019s gone,\u201d The fat child looked around.Suddenly, Xuan Yi replied, \u201cNo, they\u2019re up the peak. The Eight Distresses Formation of the abyss has already been activated. Yes, those two with the variant spirit roots are there already.\u201dWen Xuan asked hurriedly, \u201cHow many tribulations have the two of them gone through?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve already passed two, life and death. You can rest easy now, right?\u201d Xuan Yi chuckled.After pausing slightly, Xuan Yi shook his head. \u201cWait, the bow and saber carrying scholar isn\u2019t going through the Eight Distresses Formation. He might have left already out of fear.\u201dWen Xuan harrumphed gently. \u201cThis unknown lad appeared and destroyed our Ethereal Sect\u2019s spirit testing gate and left just like that? Brazen!\u201d\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dRight then, the hurried calls of a crane rang out from beyond the clouds.Wen Xuan and Xuan Yi looked up.Far above, a figure was shifting nimbly around the walls of the peak without falling off. Even while dodging the attacks of the crane, the figure was still climbing to the peak rapidly!Even with the eyesight of a Perfected Golden Core, they could not see clearly due to the distance between them and the tip of the peak.\u201cXuan Yi, look! There\u2019s an ape!\u2019 Wen Xuan said as he pointed to a black shadow on the peak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even he knows that we\u2019re one of the five main sects of the Great Zhou Dynasty and that\u2019s why he wants to be accepted as a disciple of this fortuitous sect.\u201d\u201cYes, that ape\u2019s quite agile. I wonder how long it can last under the attacks of our lil crane.\u201d\u201cListen! Lil crane seems to be angry, haha!\u201d\u201cPoor ape.\u201d\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go check it out.\u201dWen Xuan and Xuan Yi were both smiling and relaxed as they soared towards the peak carrying a child each.As they approached\u2026Wen Xuan and Xuan Yi found their smiles disappearing as they tore through the layers of mist. Instead, it looked as though they were witnessing something unbelievable.After a momentary silence\u2026\u201cCough, that black shadow\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem to be an ape?\u201d Xuan Yi pointed to a black figure climbing to the peak as he coughed and asked hesitantly.\u201cYes\u2026 it seems to be a human,\u201d Wen Xuan smiled dryly, looking awkward.Both of them could not help but feel their faces flushing after committing such an elementary mistake despite being peak masters.But in truth, it was no wonder why they were mistaken.From a distance where the black figure was murky, it was leaping left and right like an agile ape! Even though both of them were Perfected Golden Cores with an immense amount of knowledge, they would not have thought that the figure was a human!As they got closer, their expressions changed once more.\u201cThat\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem to be a human.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 There are two of them.\u201dAfter yet another momentary silence\u2026Wen Xuan could not help but grumble unhappily, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with that person. If he wants to climb the peak, so be it. Why is he even carrying a fatty with him!\u201d\u201cWait, that man\u2019s carrying a bow and saber too. Haven\u2019t I just heard of someone with that getup?\u201d Xuan Yi remarked suddenly.Right then, the fat child beside Wen Xuan pointed at the figure excitedly and yelled, \u201cPeak master, that\u2019s him! That\u2019s the scholar!\u201d\u2026On the steep mountain peak.Each time the crane flapped its wings, Su Zimo clung tightly onto the wall with his fingers and feet dug deeply into the rocks.Against Su Zimo\u2019s fingers, those sturdy rocks seemed as soft as tofu.For any mortal, they would have to find places they could step on if they wanted to climb the peak.However, that was not the case for Su Zimo.If not for the crane blocking his path, the peak he was climbing would be akin to flat ground for him.As of now, all the mortals after Su Zimo had already fell due to the crane\u2019s flaps \u2013 he was the only one still climbing.To be exact, there were two mortals left \u2013 he was carrying the little fatty too.The crane\u2019s eyes shone with rage as it cried out. Soaring into the skies, it swooped down at Su Zimo with its sharp talons.That was a vicious dive.Su Zimo wanted to dodge but it was too late.In the blink of an eye, he let go of his hand suddenly as he swayed dangerously in midair. He then reached out and dug himself into the wall once more!Snap!A large rock above Su Zimo\u2019s head was smashed into dust by the crane\u2019s sharp talons as everything sprayed down on his face. However, he was unaware of it.When some of the rocks smashed on the little fatty\u2019s body, that rotund body trembled obviously.Suddenly, Su Zimo realized something as he dangled the little fatty in midair and hollered, \u201cStop pretending or I\u2019ll toss you down!\u201dThe little fatty\u2019s eyes burst wide open as he replied hurriedly, \u201cPlease don\u2019t scare me, bro! I know my mistakes now!\u201d\u201cDo you still want to reach the peak?\u201d Su Zimo asked quickly.\u201cYes, of course!\u201d\u201cHold on to my back on your own. Don\u2019t blame me if you fall!\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dThe little fatty shifted quickly and wrapped his arms and legs around Su Zimo\u2019s neck and waist like an octopus.That way, even though Su Zimo was still carrying an additional man, he had both hands to work with.At the start, the crane\u2019s attacks weren\u2019t ferocious. It was clear that its aim was not to injure; it merely wanted to deter Su Zimo from climbing further.After multiple failed attempts, the crane was frustrated. That was why if Su Zimo had not managed to dodge the previous attack, his brains might have been crushed by the crane\u2019s talons!He did not dare to be careless against an enraged early-stage Foundation Establishment spirit demon. That was why he got the little fatty to a piggyback position so that he could have two hands to contend against the demon.In all fairness\u2026Su Zimo was only at the third section of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness and was not a match for the spirit demon yet, even if it was only at early-stage Foundation Establishment.However, Su Zimo\u2019s goal was not to fight it out with the crane. Instead, he merely wanted to dodge it and reach the peak. With that, things were much simpler.Swoosh!The crane dove once more as Su Zimo\u2019s eyes shone brightly. Pushing his legs, he continued striding horizontally on the smooth walls of the peak as he dodged the attacks of the crane while climbing up swiftly.Crack! Crack! Crack!Su Zimo\u2019s fingers and feet dug deep into the rocks. His speed was not inferior to when he was on the ground!\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dWhen the crane caught sight of that, it was even more enraged as it soared through the skies and burst off like a rocket, appearing behind Su Zimo and attacking relentlessly with its talons and beak.Its long beak was even sharper than a flying sword such that every single poke sent a sharp, ringing sound reverberating through Su Zimo\u2019s ears.As long as the beak pierced him, there would definitely be a bloody hole on his body.The little fatty was so scared that he was shivering with his eyes closed tightly.Su Zimo dodged repeatedly as his tendons cried out. With every single expansion and contraction, his blood would be filled as his large tendon convulsed intensely, pushing his body to its limits.Using just his spirit perception, Su Zimo dodged the attack of the crane countless times as he continued climbing.The cries of the crane were getting more hurried and in fact, there was even a hint of killing intent!He was getting closer to the top of the peak.At the same time, the crane\u2019s attacks were getting fiercer too!\u2026As the two Dao children looked at everything unfold from the top of the peak, they were sweating from head to toe for the scholar as though they were the ones being attacked right at that moment.The man and the crane contended against one another on the steep peak. Even though the man seemed unable to fight back, it was still extremely dangerous and intense.Any bit slower and the scholar could very well be dead in the talons of the crane!Wen Xuan and Xuan Yi had equally grim looks on their faces as they watched fixedly, prepared to save him if need be.\u201cTo think that the scholar would still have strength left to be able to continue climbing while defending against our lil crane\u2019s attack,\u201d Xuan Yi\u2019s tone was somewhat amazed.Wen Xuan commented solemnly, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the bow and saber on the scholar\u2019s waist are made from spiritual items. Even though those are pseudo spirit weapons, they weigh more than an entire ton together!\u201dWen Xuan\u2019s remark had a clear meaning behind it \u2013 if Su Zimo had not been carrying the Sanguine Crystal Bow and Cold Moon Saber, he would have been even more agile and might have even reached the top of the peak by now!Wen Xuan and Xuan Yi exchanged glances.There was a common consensus as a thought flashed through their minds. \u201cThis scholar\u2026 is interesting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That level of nimbleness, harmony and stretchability is something that even a Spirit Beast can\u2019t match.\u201d\u201cHis movements resemble an ape and python, yet there are many differences. He might have learnt them through observing wild beasts. Seems like this lad is rather talented.\u201d\u201cI wonder how many tribulations of the Eight Distresses Formation he can pass.\u201dAt that, both Wen Xuan and Xuan Yi froze with a startled expression.Wen Xuan murmured softly, \u201cThe Eight Distresses Formation is set up within the abyss beneath. If this lad truly ascends the peak, wouldn\u2019t it be equivalent to him passing the Eight Distresses Formation?\u201dOn the surface, Ethereal Sect\u2019s third Life and Death Stage was for the cultivators to ascend the peak. However, in reality, they had set an obstacle and it was intended for everyone to fall into the realm of the Eight Distresses Formation within the abyss.That was the reason why the fat child had almost let slip at the beginning of things.After all, no one would be able to ascend the peak.Only those who manage to pass through life and death tribulations within the Eight Distresses Formation would be sent to the top of the peak where they would be able to join the sect.If they failed the two tribulations, they would be teleported outside and would not be able to join the sect. At the same time, those cultivators would not know what had happened at all, merely feeling fortunate that they did not die.The Eight Distresses Formation was a type of illusory formation that consisted of eight tribulations \u2013 life, age, illness, death, meeting with what they hate, parting with what they love, unattained love and all ills of the five skandhas of Buddhism.There were two reasons why they had to beat around the bush by requesting the cultivators to climb the peak before knocking them down.First, the steep peak would first deter the cowards and those who lack resolve.Immortal cultivation was a heavenly defying act and was a path of extreme difficulty. If even those who had resolves of steel and bravery may not even reach the endpoint, there was no room for cowards at all.Second, if everyone were mentally prepared that they would be faced with the Eight Distresses Formation, the illusory realm would not be able to bewitch them that easily Ethereal Sect would not be able to achieve their full aim.In the cultivation world, be it illusory skills or formations, there would definitely be distinct loopholes to it. If the affected party were to be able to maintain their composure and alertness, they would be able to see through it and would not be bewitched by it.However, by sending the masses up the peak before beating them down, no one would be prepared and as they were faced with death, they would definitely panic before they enter the Eight Distresses Formation of the abyss.Right then, with everyone assuming that they were dead, they would then accept the illusory realm and go through the death tribulation.Once they pass the death tribulation and endure through the life tribulation, they would be considered to have passed the third stage of Ethereal Sect\u2019s tests and would be able to join the sect.Of course, there were eight tribulations to the Eight Distresses Formation and the more tribulations one could pass, the better.This was not just a simple test; it was a rite of passage for the mind.After all, everyone would have to endure the pain of the eight distresses in their lifetime and cultivators were no exception to it.Yet, a problem had appeared.If Su Zimo managed to ascend the peak, Ethereal Sect\u2019s third stage would have been set for nothing.Wen Xuan lowered his voice further and said, \u201cLet me attack and strike him down secretly. We can\u2019t go against the rules of the sect by accepting someone that hasn\u2019t gone through the third stage.\u201dXuan Yi shook his head and chuckled. \u201cNo matter. Right now, I\u2019m honestly curious as to whether he can ascend the peak with just his own strength.\u201dPausing for a moment, Xuan Yi\u2019s eyes lit up as he remarked gruffly, \u201cIf the lad truly manages to ascend, I\u2019ll set an array formation for him myself to let him have a full taste of the Eight Distresses Formation!\u201dAs the peak master of Array Peak, the Eight Distresses Formation was his masterpiece.For a peak master to declare that he wanted to lay an array formation personally for an unknown scholar was something that had never occurred through the history of Ethereal Sect.\u2026On the wall.The man and the crane were still going at it.Su Zimo was already sweating all over. His eyes remained bright as always, emanating an endless fight in them.Initially, the little fatty kept his eyes shut and was extremely frightened. However, he was now fully excited, yelling from time to time from Su Zimo\u2019s back to taunt the crane.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dDespite trying everything, the crane could not stop Su Zimo in his tracks at all. Coupled with the little fatty\u2019s mocking, it was even more furious and its attacks turned fiercer.Su Zimo was pent up as well after being chased by the crane for such a long time.Seeing that he was merely a step away from the top of the peak, Su Zimo took in a deep breath and circulated the Anaconda Eclipse\u2019s mind sutra before bellowing, \u201cDamned bird, take this!\u201dClang!A sharp slicing sound rang through the place.Su Zimo had retrieved the Cold Moon Saber on his waist and slashed upwards!Swash!A cold light shot through the air.Stunned, the crane no longer dared to attack Su Zimo as it flapped and ran away.It had not expected Su Zimo to make a move.More than that, it had not expected that Su Zimo would DARE to make a move on it!Within Ethereal Sect, no one dared to bully it. Notwithstanding the five peak masters, even Ethereal Sect\u2019s master would dote on it!The job of pushing potential sect applicants into the Eight Distresses Formation was initially done by other cultivators of the sect.However, the crane volunteered to do it thinking that it was interesting.Indeed, it was rather fun at the start to see people being chased into the Eight Distresses Formation one by one.Yet, the crane no longer found it fun after encountering this bow and saber carrying scholar.A feather glided by slowly.Even though the crane had managed to dodge the attack, the Cold Moon Saber still sliced away one of its feathers.That sight caused the two peak masters watching above to freeze momentarily, almost striking out as they gripped their spirit weapons tightly.\u201cThe gall of that lad to dare bully lil crane!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s definitely going to have a hard time in the future if he gets accepted into the sect.\u201dBoth Wen Xuan and Xuan Yi looked at Su Zimo with a trace of pity.Right then, Su Zimo did not know what was going on.After that slash, he was overjoyed as he burst out laughing. \u201cDamned bird, you\u2019re still too weak! Go back and train for a couple more years!\u201dWith a reverse throw, Su Zimo stabbed the Cold Moon Saber into the wall of the peak and in one swift leap, jumped onto the blade with the tip of his toes. He then hopped up while conveniently pulling the Cold Moon Saber out of the wall with his feet.The entire process was fluid as water without any pauses at all.In the blink of an eye, he had arrived at the top of the peak!Looking down at the crane that was still circling around in midair, Su Zimo waved and smiled. \u201cGoodbye!\u201dThe crane was still in its infancy stage. In human years, it was nothing more than eight years old and that was when it was most playful. Even though it wasn\u2019t injured by that slash, it still felt upset about it.Looking at Su Zimo\u2019s actions, the crane blinked a few times as though it was about to tear up before flying towards Ethereal Peak while crying non-stop.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201d\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dThe cries of the crane reverberated through Ethereal Peak, alarming many people.\u201cEh? Didn\u2019t lil crane go to the front peak to bully them? Why does it look as though it was the one that was bullied?\u201d A brown haired youth seated within a palace on Elixir Peak asked curiously.From a palace on Talisman Peak came a cold looking middle aged lady. Watching the crane fly through the air, she frowned slightly and muttered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with lil crane? To think that someone of Ethereal Sect would dare bully it?\u201dA disheveled old man appeared on Weapon Peak as well. Slovenly dressed, he burst out in laughter. \u201cHow dare to see lil crane being on the losing end! Interesting, interesting!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Apart from them, there were two middle aged cultivators with exceptional auras, looking at him weirdly.Su Zimo guessed that the two of them must be seniors of Ethereal Peak.Placing little fatty down, Su Zimo noticed that there were eight gigantic flags around half as high as them being planted around each of them. The flags had mysterious patterns drawn on them as they flapped in the wind.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dSu Zimo frowned. Without thinking more about it, he stabilized his breathing and arranged his attire before greeting the two middle aged cultivators. \u201cGreetings, seniors. I\u2019m Su Zimo of Yan Country. I\u2019ve managed to ascend the peak by luck\u2026\u201d\u201cActivate!\u201dBefore Su Zimo could even finish, he was interrupted by a loud holler.The eight flags surrounding Su Zimo and little fatty illuminated brightly as the patterns shone with a bedazzling glow.In the blink of an eye, Su Zimo felt an ominous sense of danger. The last thing he saw was one of the middle aged cultivators sweeping his robes from a distance away as an unblockable energy blasted at them!The energy was tremendous and Su Zimo could not resist it at all.He was swept off the peak and fell over, watching the top of the peak turn smaller by the second. His body was not his to control at all as fear started growing within him.Bam!Su Zimo fell into the abyss and his entire body was crushed.Even though his physical body was clearly destroyed, Su Zimo was still entirely conscious. Endless waves of pain shot through him, biting at him tirelessly as his tendons tore and his flesh was shredded.What was happening?Su Zimo could not understand at all.In fact, he did not have the time to think about it as he was tormented by the endless pain.He had never understood the sort of pain that one would experience in the face of death.An intense fear existed between the edge of life and death.It was a fear that could cause one to breakdown.For humans, it was almost instinct for them to fear death. If they could even shit their pants by having a sword pointed at their throat, how terrifying would it be to be faced with death itself?At the top of the peak, Su Zimo and little fatty stood motionlessly with their eyes shut and bodies shivering \u2013 neither of them had fallen into the abyss.The both of them were now within the illusion of the activated Eight Distresses Formation.\u201cThis Eight Distresses Formation is even stronger than the one in the abyss since you\u2019re the one who created it personally. Would the two of them be able to endure it?\u201d Wen Xuan asked worriedly.Xuan Yi replied, \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see. As long as they can get through one tribulation, they\u2019ll be considered to have passed the test.\u201dRight then, three figures appeared on the top of the peak.The three of them had passed the test of the Eight Distresses Formation from within the abyss. After crossing the life and death tribulations, they were teleported to the top of the peak.All three of them looked pale as a sheet, sweating from head to toe as they sat where they were feebly, looking lost and dazed.The two Dao children rushed up and fed all three of them an elixir each.Once they consumed it, the three people looked more relaxed as their faces started to fill with life once more.\u201cThe two fellas with the variant spirit roots are not bad. They\u2019ve already passed through three tribulations,\u201d Xuan Yi suddenly mentioned.Wen Xuan sighed. \u201cOf the eight distresses, life, death, illness and age are easier to get through. However, the later four tribulations are one tougher than the other. Even for myself who has already attained a core, I may not be able to get through all the tribulations.\u201dThe moment he said that, one of the eight flags swayed gently before shooting into the skies with a blinding light.Xuan Yi heaved out a sigh of relief and nodded. \u201cNot bad. The lad has already crossed the tribulation of death.\u201dA moment later, the haughty man and white bloused woman were sent to the top of the peak.Wen Xuan looked at the both of them and smiled. \u201cWell done, you guys have passed through four tribulations. Take a rest at the side.\u201dSwoosh!Yet another huge flag swayed before bursting into the skies.\u201cHmms, that\u2019s fast? He\u2019s already endured through the distress of life?\u201d Xuan Yi was surprised.The distress of life was something that everyone had to go through but have forgotten.Within the womb, a fetus would be coiled into a ball with its arms and feet unable to stretch and neither could it breathe. It was akin to being sealed in a tight cage and the pain of it was excruciating.That was also the reason why babies would cry the moment they are born.Before long, another streak of light broke through the clouds.Right after, a fourth beam of light!\u201cThis\u2026\u201dWen Xuan and Xuan Yi exchanged glances \u2013 both could read the shock in the other\u2019s eyes.From Elixir Peak, a brown haired youth soared into the skies and looked at the lights from afar, frowning to himself. \u201cThat light\u2019s from a flag for the Eight Distresses Formation. There\u2019s actually someone who could have Xuan Yi create the formation personally?\u201dWith a slight pause, he muttered to himself, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got to go check it out.\u201dAt the same time, a shadow streaked out towards the front peak from Talisman and Weapon Peak respectively.Bam!A fifth beam of light appeared!Before long, a brown haired youth, cold faced middle aged lady and a disheveled old man appeared on the top of the peak as well.All five peak masters were gathered!Swoosh!A huge flag wavered.A sixth beam of light!\u201cHe\u2019s already passed through six of the eight distresses! What a mental fortitude! Where is this lad from?\u201d The brown haired youth asked with a deep voice.\u201cHe\u2019s from Yan Country. I don\u2019t know anything other than that,\u201d Wen Xuan shook his head.The cold faced lady swept her gaze across Su Zimo\u2019s body and frowned, asking, \u201cFire spirit root?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 seemed to be the case. However, for some reason, the spirit testing gate refused to let him through. We can test him with a spirit stone again later,\u201d Wen Xuan replied.Right after he replied\u2026Bam!The seventh beam of light shot through.Su Zimo had passed through the seventh tribulation!Little fatty was already sprawled on the ground bawling in tears after enduring through the tribulations of life and death \u2013 he had yet to pull himself out of the pain received from the tribulations of the eight distresses.During the time, the two Dao children explained to everyone present about the entirety of the Life and Death Stage.From the initial 500 odd applicants, there were only six remaining on the peak who had passed the third stage.Other than the haughty man, white bloused woman and little fatty, the remaining three were mortals without spirit qi.Everyone looked at Su Zimo with a complicated gaze.They had just gone through the tribulations of the eight distresses personally and could still remember the excruciating pain they had gone through.None of them could imagine the sort of torment it would be to endure through seven different distresses.Xuan Yi spoke with a grim tone, \u201cThe eighth distress is of the five skandhas. That is akin to all of the previous seven distresses combined and isn\u2019t something any human could endure. Let me dispel the formation lest the lad is hurt.\u201dHe was just about to move when an eighth beam of light shone!It was extremely bedazzling on the peak and illuminated half the skies above them.At the same time, Su Zimo suddenly opened both eyes and with a burning killing intent, he reverse gripped his Cold Moon Saber and slashed forward!It was a breathtaking slash!That single slash was even brighter than the eighth beam that had covered the entire peak!It was directed right at Xuan Yi with an intent so chilling that the air on the peak seemed to have frozen and gone stale!All five peak masters were stunned right away.After all, the slash happened way too suddenly.Xuan Yi\u2019s expression was unchanged. Extending his finger, a light exuded from the tip of it as he tapped gently at the Cold Moon Saber.Clang!The Cold Moon Saber was sent flying.Su Zimo\u2019s body jolted as he stumbled back a couple of steps and nearly slipped off the top of the peak.When he saw the abyss beneath the layer of clouds below him, Su Zimo slowly woke up and realized that everything he had experienced was merely an illusion.The gazes of the five peak masters looking at Su Zimo changed slowly\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Joining Ethereal PeakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe thing that truly shocked the five peak masters was not the fact that Su Zimo had endured through the eight distresses.It was that slash of his.As Perfected Golden Cores, all five of them could sense the sort of energy the slash carried along \u2013 its might had surpassed even the full strength of a Perfected Qi Refinement Warrior!For a mere mortal to surpass the strength of a Perfected Qi Refinement Warrior with just a burst of his physical body, what sort of a phenomenon was that?That was proof that this man\u2019s body was as tough as spirit beasts! In fact, he might even be able to match early-stage Foundation Establishment spirit demons!Not just that, Su Zimo\u2019s slash carried a heavy killing intent!This man must have killed quite a number of times to display a slash as such!Yet, how could a mortal have killed so many times?Furthermore, their shock came from the fact that Su Zimo had dared to strike at Xuan Yi with such resolute decisiveness!One had to understand that Su Zimo was but a mere mortal.However, Xuan Yi was a Perfected Golden Core, the peak master of Array Peak! To mere mortals, he was what they would define as immortals!Yet, Su Zimo\u2019s slash had the intention of murdering an immortal!\u201cWhy did you strike at me?\u201d Xuan Yi\u2019s gaze was bright as he glared at Su Zimo and asked grimly.By now, Su Zimo had realized that he had fallen into an illusion and everything he had experienced was merely his hallucinations.Lowering his head, he replied, \u201cI mistook you as the one who had struck at me to push me off the peak. Hence, the attack.\u201dThe five peak masters had expected that answer.However, that answer was also troubling at the same time.This was a man that couldn\u2019t be tamed. Be it whether the other party was an immortal or had anyone strong backing him, as long as this man was offended, he would kill the other party!To them, Su Zimo was like a double edged sword. Resolute and sharp, not only could he kill, he could injure them as well.It was hard to tell if it would be a fortune or disaster accepting someone like this into the sect.However, Su Zimo had an extremely rare mental fortitude such that he was even able to endure through the tribulations of the eight distresses. It would be difficult for Ethereal Peak to give up on such a rare talent.Furthermore, Su Zimo had already passed all three tests of the sect.Exchanging glances, all five peak masters could not arrive at a decision.Normally, Spirit Peak\u2019s master, Wen Xuan, would definitely be the first to accept someone as such. Yet, he was keeping silent at the moment.Contemplating silently, Wen Xuan retrieved a spirit testing stone from his storage bag and handed it to Su Zimo. \u201cTest your spirit root again.\u201dSu Zimo gripped the spirit testing stone tightly.It shone scarlet red and emanated heat.All five peak masters nodded their heads in agreement.Fire element, heaven spirit root. That\u2019s right.Before that thought passed them, the spirit testing stone turned into ash and scattered from Su Zimo\u2019s fingertips.Everyone was stunned.What had just happened?The fat child pointed at Su Zimo agitatedly. \u201cPeak master, see! I didn\u2019t lie!\u201dEven though all five peak masters were Perfected Golden Cores, they had never seen anyone who could turn a spirit testing stone into ash for a mere test.It was weird.Suddenly, an authoritative voice boomed out in all five of their minds.\u201cThis lad has too much killing intent and is too brash. Since he has a Fire spirit root, we can let him join the Weapon Peak to learn more about the craft of refining weapons. We can make other plans for him after we shave away some of his aggressiveness.\u201dThat voice was from Ethereal Peak\u2019s sect master. Other than the five peak masters, no one else knew what was going on.The peak master of Weapon Peak was the disheveled old man.He snickered at Su Zimo. \u201cCome, follow me back to the Weapon Peak. From now on, you\u2019ll be a trial disciple of Ethereal Peak. You\u2019ll be under me.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dSu Zimo nodded.The haughty man, white bloused woman and little fatty were inducted into Spirit Peak naturally while the three remaining mortals were assigned to Elixir, Array and Talisman Peak.Waving his oily robes, the disheveled old man collected Su Zimo and left the peak.Before long, Su Zimo was brought to the Weapon Peak as the disheveled old man remarked, \u201cI\u2019m your master from now on. We don\u2019t have so many rules here in Weapon Peak. You can just call me old man.\u201d\u201cXue Yi. Yes, you! Come here!\u201dThe disheveled old man beckoned to a disciple passing by nearby.The man named Xue Yi was frail and skinny. Running over, he nodded his head to the disheveled old man and greeted courteously, \u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cSu Zimo here has just joined the sect and he\u2019s your junior brother. Go get him one of our sect badges and items for trial disciples before choosing a cave abode.\u201dAfter giving his instructions, the disheveled old man waved his robes and left.\u201cI\u2019ll be troubling you then, senior brother,\u201d Su Zimo greeted with cupped fists.Xue Yi smiled and waved it off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t stand on courtesy.\u201dHe brought Su Zimo before a majestic cockloft and introduced, \u201cThis is our Elixir Peak\u2019s Spirit Weapon Chamber. If any of the trial disciples from the five peaks want a spirit weapon, they would have to come exchange for it using their contribution points. To exchange for spirit stones, elixirs and cultivation manuals, one would have to use contribution points too.\u201d\u201cHow do you get contribution points?\u201d Su Zimo asked.\u201cThere is a mission stele within the five peaks that will refresh with new missions every now and then. The greater the difficulty of the missions, the more contribution points they give.\u201dXue Yi brought Su Zimo to the Spirit Weapon Chamber and greeted the elderly guard, \u201cSenior, this is a new disciple of Weapon Peak and he\u2019s here for a sect badge.\u201d\u201cOh, name?\u201dThe elderly guard opened his sleepy eyes and asked feebly.\u201cSu Zimo.\u201dFrom his storage bag, the elderly guard retrieved a long jade badge where one side was etched with mysterious patterns and the other side was smooth and blank.With his sharp nails, the elderly guard shot out a stream of spirit qi and wrote down in cursive letters \u2013 Su Zimo.Tossing the badge out, the elderly guard went back to sleep.Su Zimo took the badge over and examined it to find out that there was nothing extraordinary about it.Xue Yi smiled. \u201cJunior brother, don\u2019t look down on this sect badge. Holding it gives you freedom in and out of the sect and even the mystifying fog barrier outside can\u2019t affect you.\u201dSu Zimo nodded his head and kept it carefully.Suddenly, Xue Yi slapped his own head as though he recalled something. He then turned and smiled to the elderly guard. \u201cSenior, are you forgetting about something?\u201dWithout even opening his eyes, the elderly guard tossed out a storage bag casually.Receiving it, Xue Yi passed it to Su Zimo. \u201cJunior brother, there\u2019s a manual for the Spirit Peering Art and Qi Condensation along with 10 inferior-grade spirit stones. Do keep it well.\u201dXue Yi knew that Su Zimo had not mastered Qi Condensation yet and hence opened the storage bag before placing one of the two manuals in the latter\u2019s hands.He summoned a flying sword and had Su Zimo hop on it. Arriving at the mid of the peak, he pointed to a row of cave abodes. \u201cWeapon Peak does not have much disciples so many of our cave abodes are empty. Just pick whichever one you fancy, junior brother.\u201dRemembering that he had to cultivate his Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, Su Zimo chose a secluded one at the corner as his home in Ethereal Peak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Placing the sect badge around his waist like Xue Yi, he took out the two manuals.Spirit Peering Art was a fundamental skill in the cultivation world where almost every cultivator had to learn it. Through lining their eyes with spirit qi, one could determine the cultivation realm of other cultivators.But of course, there are rare cultivation techniques as well that could help one hide their cultivation realm from Spirit Peering Art\u2019s detection.The Qi Condensation manual could be considered as an entry skill for Ethereal Sect.Everything from opening storage bags, cultivating the Spirit Peering Art, sword kinesis flight, refining elixirs and weapons required one to have spirit qi.Because Su Zimo had a Fire spirit root, the spirit qi he could manifest from Qi Condensation would naturally carry the fire element.Before he left, Xue Yi had informed Su Zimo that there would be a welcome ceremony held 10 days later at Ethereal Palace which was situated at the main peak of Ethereal Sect. Along with many seniors, the sect master would be present as well and all the new disciples were required to attend it.Su Zimo was determined to reach Level 1 Qi Condensation before the welcome ceremony!The very thought that he would be able to obtain Sword Kinesis Flight once he achieved Qi Condensation had Su Zimo\u2019s blood boiling with excitement \u2013 he would no longer have to be in the wretched state of being chased by other cultivators!Opening the Qi Condensation manual slowly, Su Zimo was gradually immersed in the lines of tiny words.The first step of Qi Condensation was to obtain a sense of qi.Spirit Qi was everywhere and it was akin to breathing air. However, one would not be able to sense spirit qi without a spirit root.Following the instructions of the Qi Condensation manual, it took an hour before Su Zimo felt a warm sensation channeling in the air around him.It was a fresh, unique sensation unlike anything he had ever felt before.\u201cSo, this is spirit qi!\u201dAs his thoughts wavered, the sensation disappeared and he could no longer sense that warm energy.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dA flicker shot through Su Zimo\u2019s eyes as he pondered about it before coming to a realization.There were three words written on the first page of the Qi Condensation manual \u2013 Mindful Qi Condensation.Only if one was at peace and mindful would they be able to sense the existence of spirit qi. The moment they were distracted, the sensation would dissipate.But no matter what, Su Zimo was slightly relieved that he had managed to achieve the first step of sensing spirit qi.After all, there was something odd about the Fire spirit root within him; not only could it destroy spirit testing stones, it even caused the sect\u2019s spirit testing gate to explode.Previously, Su Zimo was still worried whether an implanted spirit root would achieve the same effects as an innate one. Now, it seemed as though those worries were unwarranted.The second step of Qi Condensation was to absorb the qi internally.It wasn\u2019t enough to just sense the spirit qi \u2013 one had to control and absorb it.The third step was to channel the qi to the dantian.After absorbing it into the body, one would have to control and channel it to the dantian. That was the only way to ensure that the spirit qi would be fully his instead of being dispersed through the body.With that, he would have achieved Level 1 Qi Condensation.Casting aside all distractions, Su Zimo emptied his mind and felt at the warm aura around him before absorbing it into his body slowly.All of a sudden!Su Zimo felt a warm sensation appearing in his right hand as a stream of spirit qi entered it.\u201cInteresting.\u201dThe Qi Condensation manual did not mention which part of the body will be used to absorb the spirit qi. However, it was a new experience for Su Zimo to have the spirit qi enter through his right hand.The stream of spirit qi that entered his body was rampant and wild.Frantically, Su Zimo worked to control and channel it to his dantian.The dantian was like the treasure trove of one\u2019s body. The moment the spirit qi was channeled in, everything became calm once more.Level 1 Qi Condensation!Su Zimo opened his eyes which were filled with excitement and a hint of incredibility.Night had just descended which meant to say that he had only spent less than two hours.The fact that he had managed to reach Level 1 Qi Condensation within such a short time felt surreal to Su Zimo.\u201cSeems like that\u2019s the power of a heaven spirit root.\u201dSu Zimo smiled.Now that he had achieved Qi Condensation, he was in a good mood and decided to continue absorbing spirit qi, working towards Level 2 without resting.His right hand was still the first to feel warm as the spirit qi gushed in endlessly, controlled and channeled by Su Zimo to his dantian.Su Zimo was immersed in his cultivation and just like that, an entire night had passed.Level 2 Qi Condensation!Within a single night, Su Zimo had achieved Level 2 Qi Condensation!\u201cIsn\u2019t this a little too soon? Is that how fast things move with a heaven spirit root?\u201dHe was a little stunned.Su Zimo did not know the speed in which others cultivated at. However, he merely felt that it was unusual for him to cultivate that quickly.After all, he had not even made use of spirit stones and elixirs yet for the previous night.If he had used them, wouldn\u2019t his cultivation speed be even faster?He decided to cast aside all his queries first and to ask his other seniors when he had the chance.The thought of spirit stones gave Su Zimo an idea.Before he left Ping Yang Town, he killed Zhou Dingyun and had managed to obtain a storage bag.Now that he was at Level 2 Qi Condensation, he could finally use it.Taking out Zhou Dingyun\u2019s storage bag, a stream of spirit qi flowed out of Su Zimo\u2019s fingertips as he touched the storage bag gently.It opened up and a space floated out from within with more than 1,300 inferior-grade spirit stones lined together. Other than another jade bottle, there was nothing else.He opened the jade bottle \u2013 it contained three elixirs as a gentle fragrance wafted out.Su Zimo whiffed at the fragrance and the calm spirit qi that was contained in his dantian began to rumble.He instantly understood that those three elixirs would benefit him in absorbing spirit qi.For someone like him who had just achieved Qi Condensation, this was quite a small fortune.Su Zimo kept the spirit stones, elixirs, Sanguine Crystal Bow, Cold Moon Saber and the quiver on his back into the storage bag given to him by the sect.Right away, his entire body felt lighter with one ton worth of weight removed.The amazing thing about storage bags was that no matter the weight of the items kept in them, the user would not feel it at all.Opening the manual for the Spirit Peering Art, Spirit Peering Art began cultivating it.He spent the rest of his time cultivating the Qi Condensation manual in the daytime and The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness in the nighttime. Just like that, 10 days had passed.The welcome ceremony for the seven new disciples of the sect had finally arrived.Su Zimo tidied his attire before leaping off his stone bed.Even though 10 days had passed, Su Zimo\u2019s Qi Condensation was still at Level 1 and had not increased!In reality, he was already at Level 4 Qi Condensation by the seventh day and his dantian had amassed a large amount of spirit qi.However, Su Zimo recalled Die Yue\u2019s advice \u2013 some of the truly talented cultivators would choose to use the spirit qi to refine their physical body while cultivating.For the next three days thereafter, he used all the spirit qi he had amassed to refine his body, leaving only a portion left in his dantian.Even though he made no progress for his Marrow Cleansing section, Su Zimo\u2019s body was now much stronger than it was 10 days ago.He estimated that by now, even a full forced attack by a Level 10 Perfected Qi Refinement Warrior using an inferior-grade spirit weapon would not be able to pierce his skin!Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe cave abode was extremely spacious and after some quiet meditation, Su Zimo contained his excitement of joining the sect.

Are you around?\u201dSuddenly, a voice rang out from outside the cave abode. It was Senior Brother Xue Yi \u2013 the person who had brought Su Zimo around initially.Su Zimo opened the door hurriedly.Now that they were meeting again, Su Zimo subconsciously activated his Spirit Peering Art and discovered that Xue Yi was a Qi Refinement Warrior with Level 9 Qi Condensation.\u201cEh?\u201dXue Yi looked at Su Zimo with shock and incredulity, asking, \u201cJunior Brother Su, you\u2019re already at Level 1 Qi Condensation?\u201dSu Zimo could not figure out what Xue Yi meant by that and merely nodded his head, afraid that he might make a mistake by speaking.\u201cWow, that\u2019s incredible!\u201d Xue Yi could not help but gasp.Su Zimo froze for a moment.It was incredible for someone to reach Level 1 Qi Condensation in 10 days?If he had not used the spirit qi to refine his body, he would already be at Level 5 Qi Condensation!Coughing gently, Su Zimo asked, \u201cSu Zimo, how long does it normally take for someone to reach Level 1 Qi Condensation?\u201d\u201cThat would have to depend on their spirit root. For example, I have an earth spirit root and it took me close to an entire month to reach Level 1 Qi Condensation! You have to understand that out of the three steps, sensing and absorbing spirit qi is the most difficult for beginners to grasp. They either fail to sense the existence of spirit qi or they\u2019re unable to absorb it. All of that will require time to cultivate, test, grasp and discover,\u201d Xue Yi explained.Even though Su Zimo\u2019s expression was indifferent, he was even more curious in his heart now.Sensing and absorbing spirit qi posed no challenge to him at all unlike what Xue Yi had explained.Could that be the benefit of having a heaven spirit root?The moment he thought of that, Su Zimo smiled. \u201cIt might be because I\u2019ve got a heaven spirit root and that\u2019s why I cultivated faster.\u201d\u201cThat must be it.\u201dSuddenly enlightened, Xue Yi nodded his head. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed much easier for those with a heaven spirit root to attain Qi Condensation. I heard that some geniuses take a single day to reach Level 1 Qi Condensation! But don\u2019t feel bad, junior brother. It\u2019s already extremely fast for you to reach Level 1 within 10 days.\u201dSu Zimo smiled and nodded.In reality, he had only taken less than two hours to reach Level 1 Qi Condensation!But according to Xue Yi, even the fastest geniuses require a single day.How could this be?He then thought about the explosion of the spirit testing gate, the ashing of the spirit testing stone, his frightening cultivation speed and all the other weird phenomenons\u2026The only explanation was that the heaven spirit root given to him by Die Yue was much stronger than real heaven spirit roots!\u201cI can\u2019t teach you anymore. Hence, I have planted a spirit root in you. The quality won\u2019t be any lesser than the heaven spirit root. Next, join a clan and cultivate for immortality.\u201dThat was what Die Yue said to him. It sounded casual and in fact even nonchalant.But it was only now that Su Zimo realized how horrifying the spirit root she had planted for him was.Suddenly, Xue Yi frowned and asked oddly, \u201cWait, that\u2019s weird. Junior brother, you\u2019ve got a heaven spirit root. How come you\u2019re in our Weapon Peak instead of Spirit Peak?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Su Zimo asked.\u201cA huge one.\u201dLaughing, Xue Yi replied, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for the welcome ceremony. I\u2019ll take you there and explain along the way.\u201dSummoning a flying sword, Xue Yi beckoned for Su Zimo to join him before they sped off to Ethereal Peak.Along the way, Su Zimo found out from Xue Yi that even though each of the five peaks had their own specialties, Spirit Peak was the strongest with the most disciples followed by Talisman Peak and Array Peak. The weakest ones were Elixir Peak and Weapon Peak.Spirit Peak\u2019s forte was in killing and battle skills. That was why by logic, all those with heaven spirit roots would be sent to Spirit Peak.A strong mastery of fire is required for both refinement of elixirs and weapons. Yet, Ethereal Peak was not well-versed in fire techniques. Out of the five sects, True Fire Sect was the most knowledgeable towards fire.In the Great Zhou Dynasty, there would be a competition between the sects once every 10 years where all major and minor sects would participate. There would then be four ranking lists of Spirit, Weapon, Elixir and Talisman for the top 10 of each.That was a mere 40 people out of hundreds of sects and thousands of their most talented cultivators!Anyone who could have their names listed on the rankings would not only receive immense prestige, there would be tremendous rewards as well and it was proof that they were the true talents of the Great Zhou Dynasty!Out of every sect competition, Ethereal Sect would gain the most spots on the Spirit Ranking followed by the Talisman Ranking. However, they\u2019ve never managed to get any spots on both the Weapon and Elixir Rankings.That was the reason why Xue Yi could not understand how someone like Su Zimo who possessed a heaven spirit root was sent to Weapon Peak instead of Spirit Peak.Su Zimo could guess at the reasons why it was so. Firstly, he had destroyed the sect\u2019s spirit testing gate. Secondly, he struck out at Array Peak\u2019s master, Xuan Yi.This arrangement might have been a punishment for him. However, Su Zimo was not bothered by it at all.From what Xue Yi had said, all the Qi Refinement Warriors in Ethereal Sect were all trial disciples and none of them could enter Ethereal Peak, which was surrounded by all five peaks, freely.Only Foundation Establishment Cultivators were considered as inner sect disciples and would have a chance of obtaining middle-grade spirit weapons and better cultivation techniques.With Su Zimo\u2019s cultivation speed, it would take a mere couple of years for him to become an inner sect disciple.Before long, the both of them arrived at Ethereal Peak where a majestic palace stood erected not too far away, barely visible through the clouds.There was a sign on top of the palace with the words Ethereal Palace etched in it.Xue Yi brought Su Zimo towards Ethereal Palace. Along the way, a statue of a crane stood erect. It was gigantic at 100 feet tall with its eyes shut and exuding an authoritative aura with golden and shimmering, life-like feathers.Compared to the gigantic statue, Su Zimo and Xue Yi were like tiny ants.Even though Su Zimo felt that the statue looked familiar, he did not think too much about it and merely commented in praise, \u201cI wonder who created this statue. It\u2019s so life-like that it\u2019s almost like a real crane!\u201d\u201cShh!\u201dSuddenly, Xue Yi\u2019s expression changed as he shushed at Su Zimo right away.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Su Zimo whispered uneasily.Wiping away his sweat, Xue Yi replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not a statue. That\u2019s Ethereal Sect\u2019s Mystical Guardian Beast! It\u2019s alive!\u201d\u201cAlive?\u201dSu Zimo coughed gently and raised his head to look at it again awkwardly.Because the crane stood there motionlessly, Su Zimo\u2019s first thought was that it was a statue.\u201cWhat\u2019s it perched here for then?\u201d Su Zimo asked again.Shaking his head, Xue Yi replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea either. Senior crane usually stays within the Ethereal Palace and it\u2019s rare for normal disciples to catch a glimpse of it. I guess we\u2019re really lucky today.\u201dPausing for a moment, Xue Yi looked around with a mysterious expression, whispered gently, \u201cThough, I heard that senior crane\u2019s child was bullied to tears by a new disciple recently. Perhaps it\u2019s here to settle things with that disciple! I wonder who\u2019s the unlucky one, hehe!\u201dSu Zimo suddenly stopped in his tracks and turned around. Blinking his eyes slowly, he asked, \u201cSay, is the child of this senior crane a crane too?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that just nonsense? Obviously it is!\u201d Xue Yi laughed.\u201c\u2026\u201d Su Zimo did not find it funny in the slightest bit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Tianhuang MainlandPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosWhen Xue Yi saw Su Zimo stopping in his tracks with a weird expression, he asked softly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, junior brother? Why do you look so pale?\u201dSu Zimo did not reply.As though he had recalled something, Xue Yi gasped and pointed at Su Zimo with a stutter. \u201cY-Y-You\u2019re not that\u2026 u-unlucky soul, right?!\u201dRight then, Su Zimo felt a cold wind and goosebumps rising all over his body \u2013 it was as though he was being targeted by an incomparably strong being!Su Zimo\u2019s body froze and his hands and feet turned cold as he turned around and raised his head slowly.Unknowingly, the gigantic crane behind the both of them had its eyes opened, glaring at them with an icy gaze.Before the crane, Su Zimo felt that he was incomparably small and that comparison wasn\u2019t merely for their size \u2013 it was in terms of power.If the crane wanted him dead, it did not even have to make a move! A single thought was more than enough!The air around them seemed to have gone stale as a killing intent spread slowly, making it seem as though the heavens could collapse at any moment.All of a sudden!The crane spread its wings and soared through the skies, passing by the both of them and headed towards Ethereal Palace. Its gigantic wings covered almost half of the skies as the wind howled with billowing sand.In the blink of an eye, the crane entered Ethereal Palace and disappeared from sight.Within that short moment of a few breaths, Xue Yi\u2019s face had turned pale as a sheet and he was covered in sweat.He could not help but turn to look at Su Zimo.Standing where he was, Su Zimo\u2019s expression was unchanged. Other than a slightly pale look on his face, his eyes held no fear.\u201cJunior brother, aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d Xue Yi could not help but ask.Su Zimo shook his head. \u201cIf senior crane wanted me dead, he would have struck long ago. Why wait till now and even wait for me before Ethereal Palace?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Xue Yi breathed out heavily and nodded.Suddenly, Su Zimo asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the cultivation realm of senior crane?\u201d\u201cNo idea. However, its child has an extraordinary bloodline and is a spirit demon that\u2019s equivalent to an early-stage Foundation Establishment. Imagine, it\u2019s just in its infancy stage and hasn\u2019t cultivated at all. How strong would it be when it grows up in the future?\u201d Xue Yi was clearly reminding Su Zimo to be careful in the future as well.\u2026Not long later, the haughty man, white bloused woman, little fatty and everyone else arrived at Ethereal Palace too.When little fatty caught sight of Su Zimo, his eyes shone brightly as he greeted and stumbled over.\u201cBro, amazing! You\u2019re already at Level 1 Qi Condensation!\u201d Little fatty snickered.The haughty man and white bloused woman swept their gazes past Su Zimo indifferently. To them, there was nothing special about reaching Level 1 Qi Condensation in 10 days.Su Zimo checked out the rest using the Spirit Peering Art.Within 10 days, both the haughty man and white bloused woman had already broken through to Level 6 Qi Condensation while little fatty was still at Level 5. The other three trial disciples had not managed to attain Qi Condensation yet.\u201cSay, I don\u2019t know your name yet?\u201d Since the welcome ceremony had not started yet, Su Zimo began to chat with the little fatty idly.That caused the little fatty to give off a rare look of embarrassment as he chuckled dryly. \u201cMy surname\u2019s Pang and my name\u2019s Zi.\u201dFrozen for a long time, Su Zimo repressed his amusement and praised, \u201cWhat a great name. How\u00a0befitting<sup>1</sup>.\u201d\u201cHeh!\u201dPointing at the haughty man, little fatty whispered, \u201cThat cocky fella\u2019s name is Feng Haoyu and that ice cold beauty is Leng Rou. Bro, have you realized something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat guy\u2019s surname is Feng and so he has a Wind spirit root! The ice cold beauty\u2019s surname is Leng and so she has an Ice spirit root. I\u2019ve decided. I\u2019ll definitely not have my son\u2019s surname be Pang. He\u2019ll be called Lei, Guang,\u00a0An<sup>1</sup>\u00a0or whatnot. That way, he\u2019ll definitely have a variant spirit root! Man, the thought of it is awesome!\u201dSu Zimo: \u201c\u2026 \u201dAs they conversed, many cultivators gathered before Ethereal Palace. Most of them were Foundation Establishment Cultivators \u2013 Ethereal Peak\u2019s inner sect disciples.There were also some cultivators that had flown over; they were clearly Perfected Golden Cores.The five peak masters were present as well, standing before Ethereal Palace with an emptied space in the middle for them.Before long, a bell rang out from within Ethereal Palace and reverberated through the five peaks and into the valleys.Accompanying the ring, an elderly figure in his fifties clad in golden robes came forth slowly from Ethereal Palace. Standing before the entrance, he swept his gaze across Su Zimo and the other disciples.For some reason, Su Zimo sensed that the golden robed elder\u2019s gaze seemed to have lingered slightly longer on him.\u201cI\u2019m Ethereal Peak\u2019s master, Ling Yun.\u201d\u201cEthereal Peak is one of the five major sects within the Great Zhou Dynasty. However, all of you have to understand that the land we\u2019re on is part of Tianhuang Mainland which consists of four regions, three oceans and one continent. Even the Great Zhou Dynasty is merely one of the dynasties in the Northern region of Tianhuang Mainland and there are three other dynasties with similar strength to it.\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s mouth gaped apart slightly in shock.The Great Zhou Dynasty was enough for him to look up to back in Ping Yang Town.It was at this moment that Su Zimo realized how insignificant the Great Zhou Dynasty and even Ethereal Sect was compared to Tianhuang Mainland.If he had continued staying within Ping Yang Town, he would be like a frog in a well, merely only able to see a pitiable portion of the skies.But of course, given Su Zimo\u2019s current strength, notwithstanding the four regions, three oceans and one continent, it wasn\u2019t even enough for him to move about unhindered within the Great Zhou Dynasty.After taking note of the shock within the eyes of Su Zimo and the rest, Sect Master Ling Yun nodded his head and continued, \u201cOf the seven of you, some have already managed to reach Level 6 Qi Condensation while some have yet to break through to Level 1. Those who are slower need not feel discouraged. The path of cultivation is long and arduous. All of you are just at the beginning of things. Being slow at the start does not mean that you\u2019ll always be slow.\u201d\u201cFoundation Establishment comes after Qi Condensation. From there on, you will start on a major milestone of cultivation \u2013 core formation!\u201d\u201cOnce you\u2019ve formed a core, your lifespan would extend to 500 years as you cast away your mortal self and be known as a Perfected being. After that, you will reach the Nascent Soul realm and your lifespan will further expand to a thousand years as you become known as a Perfected lord. There, your sea of wisdom is unlocked as you cultivate your spirit consciousness. Even if you are blinded, you will be able to sense everything around you as your spirit consciousness permeates through the world unobstructed!\u201d\u201cPost Nascent Soul comes Void Reversion realm where you commit your heart to the Dao and refine your spirit to the void, casting away all impurities from the Nascent Soul. It will then evolve to an Essence Spirit, transparent and fearless of the world. That is when you have truly broken free of the shackles of a physical body. Other than being able to travel with merely your consciousness, it is also equivalent to having another life as it can assimilate and cultivate a body other than your physical self! Your lifespan will be 5,000 years at that stage and at Void Reversion realm, you will be known as a Dao being.\u201dSu Zimo was shocked to hear this.There were nine sections to The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness. The seventh section was about core formation, the eight was about turning into an Yin Spirit and the ninth, Yang Spirit.The Yin Spirit section mentioned that one would be able to perceive their own spirit after breaking through the void. Was the sea of wisdom that Ling Yun mentioned referring to that void?Did that mean that the so-called Yin Spirit was the immortal equivalent of Nascent Soul?The Yang Spirit section mentioned that one would be able to obtain a pure Yang Spirit uncontaminated from Yin after refining the impurities of the Yin Spirit. At later stages, one would be able to assimilate with the Heaven and Earth powers and gather their energy!Did that mean that the so-called Yang Spirit was the immortality equivalent of Essence Spirit?Lowering his head, Su Zimo tried his best to contain the shock in his eyes.If he were to cultivate both as a demon and immortal, there was a high chance he would be able to obtain two Golden Cores in the future\u2026 two Essence Spirits!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every single step would of theirs would cross thousands of meters!\u201dThose words rattled Su Zimo and the other disciples. It was as though they were already envisioning themselves ruling over the desolates while looking down at the world with disdain.Who would not look forward to power as such?Even though many of the inner sect disciples had heard those descriptions many times, it still sent ardor and zeal coursing through their blood.Sect Master Ling Yun continued with a deep voice, \u201cHead back and work hard on your cultivation. Every end of the year, our sect will organize a face-off between the five peaks and the rewards will be generous. Even though the seven of you have just joined the sect, be it in terms of spirit root or potential, you are exceptional. I hope that there can be some amongst you that will obtain good results in our five peaks face-off.\u201d\u2026On the way back to Weapon Peak, Su Zimo asked Xue Yi, \u201cWhat\u2019s with this five peaks face-off?\u201dXue Yi chuckled. \u201cSimply put, it\u2019s to choose the best out of the five peaks. For example, for the Weapon Peak face-off, the disciples of Weapon Peak would have a competition with their skills of refining weapons. The disciple that comes out top will get to choose an inferior-grade spirit weapon of his desire from the Spirit Weapon Chamber. As for Elixir Peak, they would compete in refining elixirs. The first disciple would be able to get a Grade 1 elixir such as the Spirit Gathering Pill.\u201dFrowning, Su Zimo asked, \u201cWhat if there are multiple disciples who can craft an inferior-grade spirit weapon? How would they differentiate between the best then?\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dXue Yi burst out laughing. \u201cIf any disciple could craft an inferior-grade spirit weapon, they would definitely be the best of Weapon Peak! Junior brother, you\u2019ve yet to experience any weapon refinement techniques yet and so you do not know how difficult it is to craft an inferior-grade spirit weapon. There has never been any disciples who could craft an inferior-grade spirit weapon during the annual Weapon Peak face-off. Everyone could only manage to create pseudo spirit weapons and our master will then judge who has the best quality.\u201dSu Zimo nodded.Xue Yi continued, \u201cActually, for the five peaks face-off, all the other peaks are merely there for show. Everyone\u2019s actually more focused on Spirit Peak\u2019s face-off. After all, the disciples would be competing in terms of battling techniques and pure strength \u2013 that\u2019s way more exciting. The rewards are even better as well. Not only do they get an inferior-grade spirit weapon, a Grade 1 elixir, there would also be a Grade 1 talisman as well as a number of spirit stones.\u201d\u201cJunior brother, don\u2019t fixate yourself on it. After all, both refining of elixirs and weapons would require a large amount of energy and time. Rather than dreaming of other things, the most important task on hand is to steady yourself and focus on your cultivation.\u201dEven though Su Zimo did not rebut Xue Yi, he did not agree with it in his heart.As an Elixir Refinement Master, one could create elixirs which would be helpful for boosting their cultivations.As a Weapon Refinement Master, one could create weapons and that was a clear benefit for raising one\u2019s strength as well.Most importantly, Su Zimo possessed a Fire spirit root and that would enhance his cultivation speed, saving time.Within the five peaks, there would be inner sect disciples arriving daily to help the disciples with their queries and doubts.Upon returning to Weapon Peak, Su Zimo listened carefully to an inner sect disciple\u2019s explanation of the techniques of refining weapons before returning to his cave abode.The fundamental of refining weapons was to first be able to cultivate a spirit fire.Spirit fire was created by igniting spirit qi into flames.There were three levels to spirit fires with their difference shown through their colors \u2013 faint red, dark red and scarlet. The deeper the shade, the higher the temperature of the flame and the more the impurities that could be purged.Above spirit fires came true fires which were faint, dark and pure gold in color.The first step of creating weapons was material selection.Be it for refinement of elixirs or weapons, the materials used were spirit items of the universe that contained spirit qi within them.The second step was the smelting process.For elixirs, special Elixir Furnaces were required while for weapons, it was Weapon Tripods.Be it Elixir Furnaces or Weapon Tripods, they were all created using special materials that could endure through heat and not melt.By placing the spirit materials they chose into the Weapon Tripod and using a spirit fire to smelt it, the materials would be melted into liquid form with initial impurities preliminary purged so that it is suitable for refinement.Third step, forging.This step would require controlling the temperature to dip while forging out the shape one wanted for the spirit weapon before the liquid solidified.Of course, one would require much more effort at this step if they wanted to create something special. However, if it was just a normal flying sword, things would be much simpler.Fourth step, tempering.By increasing the temperature within the Weapon Tripod once more, one would then use spirit qi and the flames to strike at the weapon, conducting a secondary round of impurities elimination to ensure that the spirit weapon turns sturdier.Five step, spirit gathering.Spirit gathering was the crux and most difficult step of the entire weapon refinement process.Within the Weapon Tripod, a large amount of spirit qi would be released by the melted materials and they would turn extremely pure under the repeated scorching of the spirit fire.By gathering the spirit qi and fusing it into the spirit weapon, lines of spirit patterns would form on it.And that was exactly the history of spirit weapon grades as well.If a single spirit pattern was created, it would be an inferior-grade spirit weapon.If four spirit patterns could be created, it would be a supreme-grade spirit weapon!The reason why the spirit gathering stage was difficult was because if it failed, the spirit weapon would explode within the tripod, causing all their previous efforts to go to waste.At the same time, there was a high rate of failure for spirit gathering; the more the patterns being tempered, the higher the rate of failure.Sixth step, quenching.This was a simple step \u2013 simply placing the highly heated spirit weapon into cold water would finish the forging process.Extending his left hand, Su Zimo activated the stream of spirit qi from his dantian as a weak flame formed in the middle of his palm.It was a faint red color and emanated a scorching heat. However, his palm did not feel the heat at all.Level 1 Spirit Fire!Su Zimo let out a smile.As the spirit qi dispersed, the spirit fire disappeared as well.But once he channeled spirit qi, a flame appeared in his palm once more. With that, Su Zimo continued practicing merrily.Suddenly, he recalled something.Back in Ping Yang Town, Perfected Cang Lang had shot out a scarlet flame from his fingertips, burning Zhui Feng to nothingness.Now, Su Zimo finally realized \u2013 that flame was a Level 3 Spirit Fire!The thought of Zhui Feng\u2019s death caused Su Zimo\u2019s eyes to dim as his mood was damped.On his immortality cultivation, he had just obtained Level 1 Qi Condensation.On his demonic cultivation, he was stuck on the progress of the Marrow Cleansing section even after such a long time.He wondered how long more he would have to wait to take revenge for Zhui Feng.Die Yue had mentioned that The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness would get more difficult towards the end and without her around, Su Zimo would not be able to complete it.And now, he was already stuck after the Bones Strengthening at the Marrow Cleansing section. What about Organs Refinement and Orifice Clearing later on?As he fell deep into thought, Su Zimo\u2019s right palm gathered a ball of spirit fire subconsciously.Swoosh!A ball of flames rose and the scarlet color was rather striking. Shocked, Su Zimo swung his hand and the spirit qi dispersed along with the spirit fire.\u201cThat flame earlier on did not seem like it was faint red?\u201dFrowning, Su Zimo glared at his right palm before channeling spirit qi to create the spirit fire once more.Swoosh!Flames started rising.A bright light shone across Su Zimo\u2019s shocked face.Scarlet\u2026 Level 3 Spirit Fire!Translator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u201cThere are even higher realms above Void Reversion where one would be able to form rain and clouds with every flip of their hands; any thought could cause rivers to reverse, bring about enough heat to burn the oceans and shift stars from their rotations.

They had to be able to control the spirit fire, temperature and the most important process of spirit gathering. If any of the six steps were to go wrong, they would not be able to create any spirit weapons.For Weapon Refinement Masters, they were divided to elementary, intermediate and advanced depending on the grade of spirit weapons they can refine. Only those that can create superior-grade spirit weapons could be termed as Advanced Weapon Refinement Masters.For most Perfected Golden Cores, the spirit weapons they use would not be higher than superior-grade.Therefore, in the cultivation world, if anyone could become an Advanced Weapon Refinement Master, their status would be equivalent to that of a Perfected Golden Core. In fact, in terms of reputation and networking, they would even surpass the average Perfected Golden Core!However, even Advanced Weapon Refinement Masters would not dare to casually attempt for supreme-grade spirit weapons given the high failure rate.As a disciple of Weapon Peak, Su Zimo obtained a Weapon Tripod from the elderly guard and spent the rest of his time training on his weapon refinement skills in his cave abode. Occasionally, he would train his Qi Condensation and spend the nights reading into the Marrow Cleansing section.A month later.Su Zimo\u2019s cultivation realm was at Level 5 Qi Condensation and he was getting better at weapon refinement, having created a couple of pseudo spirit flying swords successfully. However, he still had no progress on the Marrow Cleansing section.To be accurate, he did not even know how to carry on with it.The Marrow Cleansing section stated that he would be able to achieve Marrow Cleansing by quivering the marrow with the sounds of tigers and leopards.Having stayed an entire year in the Cang Lang Mountain Range, he was extremely familiar with the sounds of tigers and leopards. Yet, no matter how hard he tried to imitate it, he could not achieve the desired effect of Marrow Cleansing.Su Zimo was even almost going hoarse by the end of the month\u2026He could feel that he was not going in the right direction so he intended to look for an opportunity to capture a tiger and a leopard so that he could slowly work with that sound requirement.This day, Su Zimo came forth from his cave abode.Every end of the month, the five peaks would have a simple test held; it was not compulsory and any disciples of the various peaks could take part.The first place of the test would have a chance to observe the projections of seniors in the sect refining weapons.One had to understand that every Weapon Refinement Master had a different method of doing things. It was particularly so for the step of tempering in the Weapon Tripod which was extremely secretive and not shown to most people.Through the entire month, Su Zimo had quite a number of doubts gathered. If he could take a look at those projections, it would be of great help to him.Before long, Su Zimo arrived at the Weapon Peak\u2019s Weapon Refinement Hall on a flying sword.He took a quick glance and there were more than a hundred people present!Weapon Peak\u2019s trial disciples added up to a few dozens of people \u2013 where did the rest come from?\u201cEh, you\u2019re here, Junior Brother Su.\u201dRight then, Xue Yi walked over from the side and greeted Su Zimo merrily.\u201cNot bad, you\u2019re already at Level 5 Qi Condensation!\u201dXue Yi exclaimed before asking, \u201cWhy? Are you here for the month end test too?\u201d\u201cYeah, I want to give it a shot,\u201d Su Zimo nodded his head.\u201cSure, that\u2019s good. You can also learn by looking at the way others go about it,\u201d Xue Yi thought that Su Zimo was merely there to join the crowd since the latter had just gotten started on refining weapons.\u201cSenior brother, we\u2019ve only got a couple dozens of disciples in Weapon Peak. Why are there so many people?\u201d Su Zimo asked.Xue Yi smiled. \u201cWithin the sect, any of the disciples from the other four peaks who have an interest towards weapon refinement can come to Weapon Peak to learn and take part in the month end test as well. In fact, even in the year end face-off if they want to. After all, for some of the geniuses, they will want to learn about weapons, elixirs, talismans and array formations even as they cultivate themselves.\u201dSu Zimo nodded his head \u2013 that was the same as what he thought.Su Zimo swept his gaze casually across the crowd before fixating it on a man clad in purple robes.The purple robed man looked haughty with his head slightly reared and eyes closed. It was easy to spot him from the crowd.That man was Feng Haoyu, the person with a variant wind spirit root who had joined the sect at the same time as Su Zimo.After a month, Feng Haoyu had already gone from Level 6 to Level 7 Qi Condensation!Xue Yi followed Su Zimo\u2019s gaze and said, \u201cI heard that man is called the most talented genius our sect has obtained in a thousand years! With his innate variant spirit root and an exceptional talent, many of the seniors think extremely highly of him. I\u2019ve even heard that he\u2019s going to take part in the year end face-off and boasted that he was definitely going to be the top of three peaks!\u201d\u201cTop of three peaks?\u201d Su Zimo frowned.Xue Yi explained, \u201cEven though he\u2019s a new disciple, he has a wind spirit root and by the end of the year, he would definitely be a Level 9 or 10 Qi Refinement Warrior. The only person that can compete with him in Spirit Peak is a woman called Leng Rou. I heard that she\u2019s also a new disciple.\u201d\u201cEven if he gets to be the top of Spirit Peak, what about the other two?\u201d Su Zimo asked.Xue Yi lamented, \u201cElixir and Weapon Peak. Our two peaks are the weakest in the sect. Even though it\u2019s good for the sect that we have a Feng Haoyu, it\u2019s still going to feel bad for us as disciples of Weapon Peak if he turns out top for our peak.\u201dSu Zimo was confused. \u201cFeng Haoyu has a wind spirit root. In terms of fire mastery, can he compete with Weapon Peak disciples with fire spirit roots?\u201d\u201cJunior brother, you know that anyone can create spirit fire regardless of their spirit root attributes?\u201d Xue Yi asked in reverse.Su Zimo nodded.Anyone could create a spirit fire without a fire spirit root. It was just that in terms of sensing, cultivation and mastery of it, those with a fire spirit root would be more astute to it.Xue Yi continued, \u201cFire blossoms with the presence of wind. That is Feng Haoyu\u2019s advantage!\u201dSuddenly, Su Zimo realized.Under the influence of wind, fire burns ever brighter.Xue Yi whispered, \u201cI heard that Feng Haoyu\u2019s already able to create a Level 2 Spirit Fire!\u201dStunned for a moment, Su Zimo looked at his right hand and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s indeed quite incredible\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s extremely incredible!\u201dXue Yi lamented softly, \u201cI\u2019ve already been in Ethereal Sect for six years now and I\u2019m only edging at the border of Level 2 Spirit Fire.\u201d\u201cHeh, let\u2019s not talk about these anymore.Picking himself up, Xue Yi shrugged his shoulders. \u201cBut if Feng Haoyu really does become accomplished in both refining elixirs and weapons and end up making a name for himself in those rankings during the sect competition, that would be quite the honor for our sect too isn\u2019t it.\u201dSmiling, Su Zimo nodded.\u201cEveryone, please be silent!\u201dRight then, a Foundation Establishment Cultivator appeared at the front of the Weapon Refinement Hall and pushed his hands down, causing the chatter in the hall to die down.\u201cEveryone, please head forth and select your materials before finding an empty spot within the hall on your own to refine your weapons. The test commences now!\u201dAll of the disciples began dispersing after choosing their materials as Su Zimo and Xue Yi waited before choosing a spot at the back of the hall.With his hands behind his back, Feng Haoyu stood right in front with a haughty expression; no one dared to stand shoulder to shoulder against him.Before this, Feng Haoyu had already asked around and found out that none of the trial disciples within the five peaks had managed to create a Level 2 Spirit Fire; the best amongst them was nearly bordering on the edge of Level 2.Thus, Feng Haoyu was extremely confident that he would definitely be able to top this month end test and obtain the rights to view projections of the weapon refinement process left behind by seniors of the sect.Bam!Retrieving a Weapon Tripod from his storage bag, Feng Haoyu slammed it heavily on the ground and the entire hall rattled.Every single one of his actions attracted everyone\u2019s attention.None of the hundred odd disciples attending the test were in any hurry as they all looked at Feng Haoyu after placing down their Weapon Tripod.Feng Haoyu\u2019s lips curled.Even though he did not turn around, he could feel the searing gazes that contained jealousy and envy.That was the type of feeling he enjoyed.The adoration of the masses.Extending his palm out slowly, Feng Haoyu channeled spirit qi.A ball of flames rose. It was merely a faint red color \u2013 Level 1 Spirit Fire.The entire hall went silent as everyone watched the man right at the front with bated breaths.Swoosh!Feng Haoyu extended his other palm as a stream of spirit qi shot out from his fingertips, entering the initial ball of flames.With a loud rumble, the flame burned brightly as its color deepened. Before long, it was a dark red color.Level 2 Spirit Fire!The crowd went into an uproar!Even though many disciples of the sect had heard about it, they were still shocked seeing a Level 2 Spirit Fire personally.A Level 2 Spirit Weapon would improve the success rate of creating inferior-grade spirit weapons greatly and was something that many cultivators would not be able to achieve in their lifetimes.Sensing emotions running high in the crowd, a look of glee flickered through Feng Haoyu\u2019s eyes as he pushed the ball of Level 2 Spirit Fire into his Weapon Tripod where it continued to burn.He was warming his tripod.First, the area around the Weapon Tripod had to be warmed evenly using spirit fire and after the temperature was balanced, the materials would be inserted.Because weapon refinement was a long process, many of the cultivators behind Feng Haoyu began to gather their own spirit fires and work on the tripod warming phase as well.Xue Yi looked at Su Zimo. \u201cLet\u2019s start too, Junior Brother Su.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Su Zimo nodded.Xue Yi extended his palm as a ball of flames rose. Even though it was a Level 1 Spirit Fire, its color was darker and showed vague signs of evolving to a Level 2 Spirit Fire.One did not have to concentrate too much on the tripod warming process.Xue Yi circled his spirit fire around the Weapon Tripod before letting it burn at the bottom and turning his head over to Su Zimo. He thought that he may be able to provide some advice given that this junior brother of his had just started on the craft of weapon refinement and might not be used to it.However, that move of Xue Yi rooted him where he stood.There was a ball of fervent flames burning on Su Zimo\u2019s palm and the color of it was somewhat piercing!Xue Yi was completely stumped as his mind went blank; he did not even notice that the flames beneath his Weapon Tripod had extinguished.Su Zimo was learning from others around him as well by surrounding his spirit fire around the Weapon Tripod before letting it burn at the bottom.The process of warming the tripod was something that was not mentioned when the inner sect disciples explained things previously.Through the entire month, Su Zimo had not practiced warming the tripod in his seclusion.\u201cSeems like this test wasn\u2019t a wasted trip. I got something out of it,\u201d Su Zimo was delighted internally.\u201cJ-Junior Brother Su! Y-Your Spirit Fire\u2026!\u201dRight then, Xue Yi\u2019s stammering voice sounded out in Su Zimo\u2019s ears.Turning around, Su Zimo smiled. \u201cI got lucky and somehow managed to cultivate out a Level 3 Spirit Fire by accident.\u201dHe was not saying it out of humility \u2013 it was cultivated through accident and he did not know the reason for it till this day.Xue Yi\u2019s eyes were widened as his jaws nearly dropped to the ground.This was the first time that he had heard someone say they created a Level 3 Spirit Fire out of sheer luck by accident!Even though their voices weren\u2019t loud, the surrounding disciples heard everything loud and clear.Level 3 Spirit Fire?Dream on!Some of the disciples in front turned around and were stumped as well.An odd tension began to spread and permeate through the hall.Standing right at the front, Feng Haoyu seemed to have felt something as he frowned. However, he did not turn around out of arrogance.Within the hall, there was no one worth his attention to turn around!Suddenly, an ear-piercing shriek broke the odd tension in the hall.\u201cLevel 3 Spirit Fire!\u201dAfter that shriek, the entire hall went bonkers.\u201cScarlet! It\u2019s truly a Level 3 Spirit Fire!\u201d\u201cWho is this person? He doesn\u2019t look familiar! How have we not seen him before?\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s one of the new disciples who joined this year.\u201d\u201cThis is way too incredible. This man is only a Level 5 Qi Refinement Warrior and yet he\u2019s able to cultivate a Level 3 Spirit Fire? What sort of talent is that?\u201dWhen he heard the discussion going on behind him, Feng Haoyu\u2019s expression turned grim.Standing silently, he composed himself and turned around slowly, looking back indifferently.The scarlet flame was the first thing that entered his line of sight.Right after, a face with sharp features and green robes that he had seen before.\u201cHim again!\u201dFeng Haoyu narrowed his eyes coldly.\u201cMmm?\u201dSensing enmity, Su Zimo who was initially still warming his tripod looked over instinctively.\u201cWhat keen senses!\u201dFeng Haoyu remarked internally.He had already kept his enmity well hidden but he had not expected that Su Zimo would notice it still.Their gazes met for a brief moment as Feng Haoyu turned back indifferently, haughty as ever.On the surface, it seemed as though Feng Haoyu did not take it to heart.However, the Level 2 Spirit Fire beneath his Weapon Tripod had already been extinguished \u2013 that was a clear sign of his shock!Su Zimo smiled and thought nothing more of it. Noticing that his Weapon Tripod was already warm, he was about to insert his materials when a head suddenly popped out beside him.He was so shocked that he pulled his Cold Moon Saber out of his storage bag and almost slashed forth\u2026\u201cGreetings, master!\u201d\u201cGreetings, peak master.\u201dWhen the disciples in the hall saw who it was, all of them greeted.Su Zimo coughed gently, keeping his Cold Moon Saber without a trace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the disheveled old man merely waved it off and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, continue with what you were doing. I\u2019ll just be watching from the side, no pressure.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Su Zimo nodded his head.Pausing for a moment, the disheveled old man patted Su Zimo on the shoulders and commented sincerely, \u201cLad, you don\u2019t have to be strung up all day all night in Ethereal Sect. Relax, no one is going to hurt you. Don\u2019t brandish your saber for every small reason.\u201dIn reality, Su Zimo\u2019s reaction was trained during his time in Cang Lang Mountain Range and had already become a habit.Outside the mountain range, every single beast was an enemy to Su Zimo.Even back in his cave, he had to be alert against the Spirit Monkey\u2019s mischievous attacks; that was why he was so neurotic.However, it did not mean that Su Zimo would let his guard loose just because of what the disheveled old man said. He would merely pay more attention so that he would not brandish his saber casually.The disheveled old man continued, \u201cBesides, even if you want to brandish it, you\u2019ve got to see your opponent first. One month into the sect and you\u2019ve already pointed your saber at two peak masters. What\u2019s going to happen the longer you stay?\u201d\u201cCough, cough. I\u2019ll take note of it,\u201d Su Zimo chuckled embarrassedly.Usually, none of the peak masters would appear for a month end test as such, especially not the peak master of Weapon Peak who was known to be lazy by nature.Yet, everyone present was clear why the disheveled old man was appearing now.It was definitely not for Feng Haoyu, but Su Zimo.Right then, Feng Haoyu who was standing right at the front had a burning sensation on his face. However, because he was back facing everyone else, no one could tell of the coldness in his eyes.Composing his emotions, Feng Haoyu began to warm the tripod once more.At the back of the hall, Su Zimo had already begun to insert the materials since his Level 3 Spirit Fire was not extinguished.With all the materials inserted, he channeled a large amount of spirit qi and flames burnt furiously, enveloping the entire Weapon Tripod.The temperature in the tripod continued to climb!The process of smelting was to turn all the materials to liquid state using a high temperature before fusing them together once more, removing as much impurities from them as possible.It was a step that had nothing to do with weapon refinement technique and was a clear indicator of the difference between different levels of spirit fire.Even if it was an Advanced Weapon Refinement Master wielding a Level 2 Spirit Fire, he would not be able to match an amateur with a Level 3 Spirit Fire during the smelting process.Before long, the materials in the tripod had begun to melt before turning into a metal liquid that emanated spirit qi.The Level 3 Spirit Fire continued burning.The golden liquid burnt within the tripod, bubbling endlessly as the spirit qi inside thickened.At that, the disheveled old man\u2019s eyes flickered with a hint of satisfaction as he nodded.The metal liquid glowed bright red as the quantity was condensed through the repeated scorching \u2013 that was due to impurities being purged away.15 minutes later, the metal liquid was no longer condensing.That did not imply that it was free of impurities \u2013 it was merely the smelting limits of a Level 3 Spirit Fire.The smelting process was over.Right then, the materials of the other disciples had merely only started to melt. Of them, Feng Haoyu\u2019s speed was faster as a metal liquid was formed within his tripod.Not only was the Level 3 Spirit Fire better in purging impurities, it was faster as well as Su Zimo led the pack far ahead!The next step, forging.Su Zimo dispersed his spirit fire and waited for the temperature within the tripod to dip. At the same time, he cultivated and rested at the side, replenishing the spirit qi he had expended.Forging required channeling of spirit qi to create a pair of spirit hands which would be inserted into the Weapon Tripod. One would then have to forge the shape of the spirit weapon they wanted before the metal liquid solidified.If one entered too early when the temperature was too high, notwithstanding the fact that the spirit hands may disperse easily, it would be difficult to forge the weapon since the metal liquid would not be completely cooled.However, if it was too late and the metal liquid was completely solidified, one would not be able to forge as well.This step was a test of experience.After five minutes, Su Zimo suddenly bolted up and channeled his spirit qi fervently. A pair of hands appeared in midair that reached into the Weapon Tripod, grabbing hold of the metal liquid.That was the perfect moment when the metal liquid was malleable without solidifying just yet!At the side, the disheveled old man was getting more pleased as he watched the focused Su Zimo.\u201cBloody hell, I\u2019ve really found a treasure this time round!\u201dIf not for the fact that so many disciples were present, the disheveled old man could not wish for more than to hug Su Zimo tightly for a kiss right then.For some reason, Su Zimo felt a gust of cold wind behind his ass and could not help but broke into a shudder.Before long, a flying sword slowly took shape.The blade was long without any edge yet \u2013 this was merely a rough shape.By now, many of the disciples had given up on the test and were watching Su Zimo\u2019s weapon refinement process instead.When they noticed the shape of the sword being crafted, a shushing sound spread out from the crowd.Feng Haoyu was done with his smelting at the moment and was waiting for the temperature in the Weapon Tripod to dip. As he sat where he was to rest, he could not help but turn around to check out the commotion.The moment he saw the shape of the sword in Su Zimo\u2019s Weapon Tripod, he scoffed with a look of mockery and turned back.After the forging was complete, Su Zimo could naturally sense the strange tension around him.\u201cMaster, have I made a mistake?\u201d he could not help but ask.The disheveled old man waved it off and replied nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s not really a huge mistake. You\u2019ve grasped the forging timing really finely. It\u2019s just that you\u2019ve added an additional hilt to your sword.\u201cAn additional hilt?\u201d Su Zimo froze for a moment, confused.The disheveled old man asked, \u201cDo you know why most of the flying swords cultivators use do not have a hilt?\u201dSu Zimo shook his head.\u201cA flying sword is the most common Dharma treasure for swords in the cultivation world. Its advantage is that its fast, agile, versatile and both ends are bladed. Unlike a normal sword, a flying sword does not have a hilt because the presence of it leads to greater air resistance and in turn, a lower speed and agility.\u201dSuddenly, Su Zimo\u2019s eyes lit up.In the past, he did demonic cultivation and was always engaging in melee combat with others. Now, he was less than a month into immortality cultivation and did not have much practice with swords yet.At the end of the day, immortal and demonic cultivation were different. Cultivators do not go against others by wielding flying swords with their hands. Instead, they channeled their spirit qi into a stream of energy so as to control flying swords from afar.During a fight, if a flying sword that struck the enemy has a hilt, the sword would not pass through their bodies.Without a hilt, the flying sword would pierce their bodies with ease, allowing the cultivators to continue controlling it without being affected.If the opponent had a body tempering technique which gave them an extremely robust physical body, a flying sword with a hilt may end up in their hands instead.Without a hilt, the sword would be edged at every point and the opponent would not be able to catch it barehanded.For a flying sword, a hilt was nothing more than a burden.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just be more careful in the future. Don\u2019t be discouraged.\u201dSu Zimo nodded.No matter the end result, his trip today was not wasted.Even though forging looked to be a simple step, there were many factors to consider when shaping a spirit weapon so as to unleash its full potential.Fourth step, tempering.The forged flying sword hovered within the Weapon Tripod as Su Zimo reignited a new ball of Level 3 Spirit Fire to heat it up.Temperature control was crucial for this step.Too high and the flying sword would melt.Too low and the desired effect of tempering would not be achieved.It was crucial to have the spirit weapon burn at a scarlet, transparent color.Through the past month, Su Zimo had failed countless times at just the tempering step.After a brief moment, the flying sword in the Weapon Tripod began to turn red. Under the continued burning of the flames, the sword\u2019s body gleamed with a bright red.Su Zimo maintained his control and placed the flying sword at the bottom of the tripod before conjuring a hammer using spirit qi to start the tempering process.Cling! Clang!Tempering can not only eliminate even more impurities, it can strengthen the sturdiness of the sword as well.Out of all six steps, this step was where technique was most important and every Weapon Refinement Master had their own way of doing things.Su Zimo went about it with pure brute strength as he knocked at the sword.The disheveled old man who was watching him frowned \u2013 Su Zimo was way too rough in his technique and was no different from blacksmiths of the mortal world.At the same time, Feng Haoyu had begun tempering his flying sword as well.Unlike Su Zimo, Feng Haoyu was much cleaner in his tempering skills.Feng Haoyu had a wind spirit root and because of that, the element of wind spirit qi was present in the hammer he conjured to strike at the flying sword. Because of that, the tempered sword would be more agile and swifter.While hammering, the sharpness of the sword was gradually revealed too.It was clear that Feng Haoyu was experienced through his technique and faster. Before long, he was almost caught up to Su Zimo.After five minutes, Su Zimo heaved out a sigh of relief.He was done with tempering!For a pseudo spirit weapon, the final step would be to just throw the scarlet flying sword into cold water for the quenching step.However, Su Zimo had an idea.Since this flying sword had a hilt and was imperfect to begin with, he could attempt spirit gathering with it!For the past month, Su Zimo had already destroyed tens of flying swords without a single success on spirit gathering.Based on what the inner sect disciples mentioned, there was no technique required for spirit gathering and it was more of a luck thing \u2013 the luckier one was, the higher the chances of success.But of course, that was on the pretext that there were no major issues with the four previous steps.After tempering, Su Zimo did not shift the flying sword out of the Weapon Tripod and instead glared at the spirit qi within it keenly.\u201cIs he thinking of spirit gathering?\u201d\u201cIf he manages to succeed, that\u2019ll be amazing!\u201d\u201cHmph, I think he\u2019s thinking too highly of himself trying to attempt spirit gathering after a single month into weapon refinement!\u201dA series of discussions filled with shock and ridicule broke out around them.Casting away all distractions, Su Zimo calmed his mind \u2013 this was a step that required absolute focus from the Weapon Refinement Master without any bit of distractions!Taking in a deep breath of air, he controlled the spirit qi within the tripod and willed it towards the scarlet flying sword.Through the pressure, a pattern appeared vaguely on the sword. It was faint and barely formed.\u201cLook, a spirit pattern!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really a spirit pattern! But it has yet to take shape.\u201d\u201cCould he really manage to create an inferior-grade flying sword?\u201dRight then, Feng Haoyu was just done with his tempering step as well. When he heard the discussions, his heart skipped a beat as he turned towards Su Zimo.If Su Zimo had managed to create an inferior-grade spirit weapon, he would have to take the gambit and attempt spirit gathering too.However, Feng Haoyu had no confidence about it. After all, spirit gathering was way too difficult and he had yet to succeed at it too.The disheveled old man glared at the flying sword within the tripod fixedly, sweat forming on his palms \u2013 he was even more nervous than Su Zimo.Piak!Right then, a crisp sound rang out from Su Zimo\u2019s Weapon Tripod.It was over!Su Zimo lamented internally.What followed was a booming sound as the flying sword exploded with its shards striking at the interiors of the Weapon Tripod.He had failed!However, it was to be expected.Su Zimo shook his head and chuckled in exasperation.The disheveled old man sighed gently.At the side, Xue Yi looked on with pity.At that, Feng Haoyu was finally relieved.Because Su Zimo\u2019s flying sword had exploded, Feng Haoyu had no intention to attempt spirit gathering as well. Instead, he took out the pseudo spirit weapon from his tripod and dipped it in cold water.Clack!A thick, white smoke billowed out from the water basin.The flying sword was successfully created with a sharp gleam and a suffocating aura!Feng Haoyu placed the flying sword at the front desk and awaited the evaluation results.Right as Su Zimo kept his Weapon Tripod, a loud voice boomed out in the hall.\u201cThe level of one\u2019s spirit fire isn\u2019t listed as one of the six steps of weapon refinement. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll become a Weapon Refinement Master just because you can cultivate a Level 3 Spirit Fire.\u201dSu Zimo turned to the voice and met with Feng Haoyu\u2019s cold, sneering gaze.With a fake smile, Feng Haoyu continued, \u201cJunior Brother Su, one has to be tread steadily. If one were to attempt flying before they can even walk, they might end up falling twice as heavily.\u201dSu Zimo furrowed his brows slightly.The both of them had only met a couple of times before and had never spoken nor crossed one another\u2019s paths. Yet, for some unknown reason, Feng Haoyu had a strong enmity towards him!It was particularly so today.\u201cWell said, Junior Brother Feng!\u201d\u201cFufu, some people are way over their heads because they have a Level 3 Spirit Fire. Know your place!\u201dThe disciples who spoke were not from Weapon Peak; they were Spirit Peak disciples who had come to take the test. There was naturally no way they would give up on a chance to take sides with Feng Haoyu by mocking Su Zimo at such a juncture.\u201cStop with all that salty talk! How about talking again after any of you can get a Level 3 Spirit Fire!\u201d Xue Yi could not help but stand up and scoff coldly.Many of the Spirit Peak disciples found themselves speechless as they looked awful.No matter what, even if Su Zimo had failed in spirit gathering, it was a fact that he had managed to cultivate a Level 3 Spirit Fire. No one from the five peaks could match that!Feng Haoyu continued, \u201cJunior Brother Su, don\u2019t take this loss to heart. We\u2019ve still got the five peaks face-off at the end of the year. I hope that you\u2019ll be able to win me by then.\u201dSu Zimo looked at Feng Haoyu indifferently without replying.The disheveled old man stood at the side watching without saying anything. At the end of the day, he was a senior and was naturally not bothered with the verbal squabbles between disciples.After awhile, the disciple hosting the test declared, \u201cEven though all of you crafted a pseudo spirit weapon, Feng Haoyu\u2019s flying sword has a better quality and he was faster. As such, he is the first place for this test.\u201dMany Spirit Peak disciples began cheering.Feng Haoyu grinned as he looked past Su Zimo to the disheveled old man. Bowing slightly, he spoke, \u201cPeak master, please take me to observe the projections of weapon refinement left behind by seniors of the sect.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dThe disheveled old man nodded nonchalantly. \u201cYou\u2019re naturally qualified since you took first place.\u201dThereafter, he yanked Su Zimo by the arm and commented casually, \u201cCome on, lad. You\u2019ll go have a look too.\u201dSu Zimo froze for a moment.Feng Haoyu frowned and said gruffly, \u201cSu Zimo doesn\u2019t even have a ranking place in this test because he failed to create a weapon. So, he isn\u2019t qualified to watch it. Are you sure what you\u2019re doing is appropriate, peak master?\u201d\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s inappropriate.\u201dThe disheveled old man nodded in agreement before grinning. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t care.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The walls were lined densely with more than a thousand jade scrolls.Most of them were dim in color except for a hundred or so that shone lusciously bright.The disheveled old man pointed at the jade scrolls on the wall. \u201cThese are the projections left by Weapon Refinement Masters since the beginning of Ethereal Sect. Those bright ones are the projections of the successful spirit weapon refinements. Even though the remaining ones are projections of failures, they are of Weapon Refinement Masters as well. Each of you can choose 10 to observe.\u201dEven though it seemed as though there were many jade scrolls, one had to understand that Ethereal Sect was founded thousands of years ago. Yet, only these jade scrolls remained and majority of them were projections of failures.Without thinking twice, Feng Haoyu went for 10 lusciously bright jade scrolls.Those were projections of successful spirit weapon refinements.Su Zimo mulled for a short period of time before choosing five bright and five dim ones.He understood that while there were things to learn from successes, he could also learn how to prevent similar mistakes from happening by looking at the failures.When the disheveled old man saw that, he nodded to himself.For a Weapon Refinement Master, it was difficult to replicate the successes of others. However, they could prevent similar mistakes \u2013 that was a form of wisdom as well.Su Zimo took the 10 jade scrolls and assumed a lotus position. Injecting spirit qi into the scrolls, the patterns on them shone brightly as a clear image appeared before him.He was immersed into it, deepening his insights towards weapon refinement while clearing the many doubts he had accumulated.In the blink of an eye, a day and night had passed.Feng Haoyu stood up and returned the 10 jade scrolls. He took a casual glance at Su Zimo who was still immersed in learning and left the Weapon Refinement Hall.Before long, Su Zimo stood up and returned the jade scrolls too.\u201cHow was it? You\u2019ve learnt a lot, right?\u201d The disheveled old man asked, smiling.Su Zimo nodded his head and asked after pondering, \u201cIndeed, I\u2019ve learnt something for the first four steps of weapon refinement. However, I\u2019m still clueless towards spirit gathering.\u201d\u201cThe difficulty of spirit gathering lies in the fact that spirit qi existed in a stable state within the materials. However, after the smelting and combining process, there is a stark change to the structure of the flying sword. Because of that, it is astronomically difficult to infuse the spirit qi back into the flying sword. Coupled with the fact that the flying sword would be heated to a scarlet red state, any misalignment in synergy would result in an immediate explosion.\u201dThe disheveled old man then sighed gently. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Even Advanced Weapon Refinement Masters would not dare to proclaim a 100% spirit gathering success rate. Most of them develop a sense of spirit perception after many years of refining weapons.\u201dThe mention of that had Su Zimo\u2019s heart skipping a beat.Spirit perception?Through the experience of life and death as well as The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness, Su Zimo had already developed a sense of spirit perception.However, could he apply that same spirit perception to spirit gathering?His mind began to tinker, wondering if he could work in that direction.\u201cHead back first. If you\u2019ve got any doubts, feel free to look for me here at any time,\u201d As he said that, the disheveled old man pointed to the jade scrolls on the wall and winked to Su Zimo.\u201cMmm?\u201dSuddenly, Su Zimo realized what the disheveled old man meant.He was hinting to Su Zimo that by coming over to look for him, the latter could seize the opportunity to look through the jade scrolls on the wall.\u201cThank you, master,\u201d Su Zimo bowed with a warm sense of thankfulness seeping into his heart.The moment he walked out of the Weapon Refinement Hall, he saw someone at the entrance.Feng Haoyu.He seemed to have waited for a long time.Su Zimo frowned slightly. Right as he was about to summon a flying sword to return to his cave abode, Feng Haoyu turned around and with a slightly reared head, blocked Su Zimo\u2019s path with his hand.\u201cIs there anything?\u201d Su Zimo found himself irked by the haughty expression of this man.Feng Haoyu replied indifferently, \u201cAt the end of this year, I want to make history in Ethereal Sect and be the top of three peaks with Weapon Peak being one of them. Junior Brother Su, you\u2019re a smart man. I\u2019m sure you know what to do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Su Zimo shook his head expressionlessly.\u201cAre you challenging me?\u201d Feng Haoyu narrowed his gaze and released his Level 7 Qi Condensation. Instantly, a cold gust of wind shrouded around him.\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201dWith a cold scoff, Su Zimo rode his flying sword and left the Weapon Refinement Hall in the blink of an eye, disappearing from Feng Haoyu\u2019s sights.\u2026Back in the cave abode, Su Zimo sat on his bed and thought about the contents of the 10 jade scrolls.Before long, a hurried knock sounded on his door.\u201cBro, it\u2019s me!\u201dIt was little fatty\u2019s voice.They had not seen one another in a month and little fatty was at Level 6 Qi Condensation as well.The cultivation speed of those with a heaven spirit root was indeed frightening. There was a high chance that Feng Haoyu, Leng Rou and the little fatty could be at Level 9 or Perfected Qi Condensation before the end of the year!\u201cBro, I heard that you made an enemy out of Feng Haoyu?\u201d That was little fatty\u2019s first question.Su Zimo asked, \u201cYou even know about something like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just me! News of this has already spread through all five peaks and many disciples are talking about it!\u201d Little fatty then sighed. \u201cBro, that\u2019s a little irrational.\u201d\u201cEach of us can cultivate on our own. What has that got to do with anything?\u201d Su Zimo chuckled casually, totally indifferent about it.\u201cThings are not that simple.Little fatty continued, \u201cThe sect prohibits disciples from killing one another internally and therefore you can reject even if he comes to challenge you. However, things are different out of the sect. Bro, you can\u2019t stay in the sect forever, right? Most of the sect\u2019s missions require you to head out. Feng Haoyu has gathered a lot of disciples on his side by now. The moment you step out of the sect, many of them are going to cause trouble for you.\u201dSu Zimo raised his brow without saying anything.Little fatty went on, \u201cActually, given Feng Haoyu\u2019s endowment, he will definitely be at Foundation Establishment realm after the five peaks face-off and promote to be an inner sect disciple. Bro, you can actually just avoid him this time round and take part in next year\u2019s face-off. That way, he\u2019ll owe you a favor too.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s discuss this another time,\u201d Su Zimo declined to comment further.Little fatty nodded. \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019ll always be on your side, bro! If you need me for anything, just say the word!\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Su Zimo smiled.The both of them continued chatting casually before little fatty left.Su Zimo pondered quietly within his cave abode, deciding to head out of the sect for a bit.He was getting a little anxious now that there was no progress for the Marrow Cleansing section in an entire month.When he had first cultivated the Bovine-tongued Saber, he only understood the essence of it by observing a cow eating grass.This time round, Su Zimo decided to capture a tiger and leopard at a forest nearby the sect so that he could take a deeper look at things.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The upper section contained missions for the five peaks that any disciples could take on while the lower section only had missions of Weapon Peak reserved for their own disciples.The further front the mission was, the more difficult it would be and the more contribution points earned.Great Rock Forest.It was located dozens of miles Northward of Ethereal Peak and was abound in pure gold, a crucial material for refining flying swords.The mission to gather materials was not considered to be difficult. However, because it was in Great Rock Forest, the difficulty level became much more significant, even slightly treacherous in fact.Every single mountain range and forest was bound to contain beasts.Around the outer regions, most of the beasts were either wild ones or weak spirit ones. Yet, the deeper one ventured, the stronger the beasts were. In fact, spirit demons may even be found right in the core regions.If targeted by a spirit demon, even a Foundation Establishment Cultivator may not be able to escape unscathed.The gold mine was located right in the core region of Great Rock Forest!This was a mission for Weapon Peak and even though it was already listed for sometime, no one really dared to take it on.Great Rock Forest was one of the nearest forests to Ethereal Sect.Because Su Zimo had intended to head over to begin with, he took on the mission out of convenience.A sleepy elderly man rested at the mission station.From Xue Yi, Su Zimo learnt that this was one of Weapon Peak\u2019s three elders, Elder Liu.The disheveled old man, Elder Li who kept guard over the Weapon Peak and Elder Liu were the three elders of Weapon Peak.In Ethereal Peak, anyone who could gain the title of elder had to be in the Golden Core realm at least.Su Zimo came before Elder Liu and handed the latter his sect badge.Raising his head, Elder Liu frowned before throwing the sect badge back to Su Zimo and barking coldly, \u201cNot allowed to go!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Su Zimo asked.Elder Liu rolled his eyes and replied, \u201cAre you stupid, lad? You want to court death going to Great Rock Forest with Level 5 Qi Condensation? Even Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors would have to form a team to take on this mission!\u201d\u201cI just want to go take a look. If it\u2019s dangerous, I\u2019ll leave for sure,\u201d Su Zimo smiled.In truth, even though Great Rock Forest was dangerous, the mission wasn\u2019t too difficult for someone like Su Zimo who had spirit perception.\u201cYou think you can escape if you really come across any danger?\u201d Elder Liu pouted his lips. \u201cLook how weak you are! Say, don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you if you die out there!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, elder. I\u2019m not going to die. I\u2019m quite the lucky man,\u201d Su Zimo chuckled.Harrumphing coldly, Elder Liu made a record and the mission on the stele dimmed in color, indicating that someone had taken it on.After a brief silent, Elder Liu pulled out an intricate paper crane from his storage bag and passed it to Su Zimo. \u201cThis spirit crane is used for communications in our sect. If you really encounter trouble, you just have to let this fly.\u201d\u201cThank you, elder,\u201d Su Zimo kept the spirit crane in his storage bag and cupped his fists before leaving Weapon Peak on his flying sword.Closing his eyes lazily, Elder Liu went back to sleep before grumbling, \u201cJuniors these days really don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them.\u201d\u2026This was Su Zimo\u2019s first time out of the peak after joining it for a month.He took out the spirit crane that Elder Liu gave him and observed it.He had seen something like this before once.Back in Yan Country\u2019s capital when Su Zimo was chasing after the one-armed cultivator from Joyful Clan, the latter had sent a similar paper crane to inform his sect about it.There were mysterious patterns drawn on the paper crane and it would be activated by injecting spirit qi.Su Zimo had a hunch that this paper crane was in reality a type of talisman.Keeping it, he suddenly frowned as something jolted through his heart.Someone was following him!Su Zimo scoffed internally.For someone to follow him right after leaving the sect? There was no need to think further \u2013 the stalker was definitely from their sect.\u201cCould little fatty be right? Feng Haoyu is really trying to cause trouble for me outside?\u201dWith an unchanged expression, Su Zimo sped towards the direction of Great Rock Forest without any reaction.Before long, he arrived at the border of Great Rock Forest.Along the way, Su Zimo had gathered vaguely that there were five people in total behind him. The strongest of them was already at Level 9 Qi Condensation!\u201cIf these guys are truly sent by Feng Haoyu, he really thinks highly of me.\u201dSu Zimo laughed and without hesitation, dove right into the forest.Entering the forest was akin to entering Su Zimo\u2019s territory. Here, no one was his match.Su Zimo cast away his flying sword and sprinted on his feet, zipping left and right. Before long, he lost the people trailing him and arrived at a secluded spot where he abandoned his green robes and bared his upper body.A series of cracking sounds came forth from within Su Zimo as his tendons and bones screamed together while his body expanded. In the blink of an eye, he had grown to over two meters tall with his flesh swelled and muscles bound together. His body had inflated entirely!Su Zimo\u2019s facial muscles contorted and joined together bizarrely. After a split second, his features had changed as he transformed into a fierce, burly man with a naked upper body!With the first three sections of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness completed, Su Zimo could change his appearance from head to toe such that even those close to him would not be able to recognize him!Lowering his head, Su Zimo laughed and with a swift dash, disappeared from where he was.\u2026\u201cSenior Brother Zhou, where did that Su Zimo run off to? How did we suddenly lose track of him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I said we should have made a move earlier on! How are we going to find him now that he slipped into Great Rock Forest?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhou Wei\u2019s face was grim as he hollered, \u201cWe were so close to the sect just now. What if a disciple heading out spots us making a move at him? We\u2019ll be punished when we head back if that happens!\u201dZhou Wei was a trial disciple of Spirit Peak. At Level 9 Qi Condensation, he was quite a somebody within it too.Then came someone like Feng Haoyu with a variant spirit root and a heavenly defying endowment, defeating him with a mere Level 7 Qi Condensation.Zhou Wei had submitted completely in the face of Feng Haoyu\u2019s strength.Even though he conducted this operation on his own accord, it was with Feng Haoyu\u2019s silent consent.Apart from Zhou Wei at Level 9 Qi Condensation, there were four others at Level 7 and 8 \u2013 these people were enough to teach Su Zimo a harsh lesson!\u201cLook again carefully. That Su Zimo is only at Level 5 Qi Condensation. How far can he run? He\u2019s definitely at the perimeter of Great Rock Forest,\u201d Zhou Wei analyzed calmly.A Spirit Peak disciple asked, \u201cWhat if he already ran inside Great Rock Forest?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for the best. If that lad gets shredded apart by the spirit beasts, he only has himself to blame,\u201d Zhou Wei replied with a cold snicker.Another Spirit Peak disciple asked, \u201cHow should we deal with Su Zimo if we find him?\u201dA cold look flashed through Zhou Wei\u2019s eyes as he spoke darkly, \u201cWe\u2019re forbidden to murder or cripple any fellow disciples of their martial arts. However, we can injure him severely by breaking his bones and tendons! If he can\u2019t get out of bed for the whole year, he naturally won\u2019t be able to take part in the year end face-off for Weapon Peak!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Laying low to the ground, he trawled through the grass on both hands and legs, heading in the direction of Zhou Wei and the rest.He was perfectly hidden within the grass which was around half the height of an average man.If one were to look down, they would merely feel like the grass was moving in a straight line due to the wind \u2013 no one would be able to tell that it was a person!\u201cSenior Brother Zhou, should we split up and search?\u201d\u201cSounds like a plan. That Su Zimo\u2019s only at Level 5 Qi Condensation. Any of us is enough to capture him.\u201dZhou Wei nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll do that then. Everyone, split up and look!\u201d\u201cWhat are you guys looking for?\u201dThe moment Zhou Wei said that, a hoarse and chilling voice rang out behind him.When Qi Refinement Warriors travel on their flying swords, they would not be too high up from the ground at around 3 meters max unless necessary.That was because the higher they were, the more spirit qi they would expend.Right then, a burly man with a bare upper body stood up behind Zhou Wei. He was a full two meters tall with rock-like muscles on his body, looking as though they could explode at any moment. He was just like a god that had suddenly descended with a ferocious expression!Instantly, Zhou Wei was so scared he could feel his blood curdle.He did not manage to sense someone approaching so closely to him!Suddenly, the burly man reached out and pulled Zhou Wei by the feet, yanking him down and smashing him into the ground right in front of the other four Spirit Peak disciples!Bam!There was a deafening sound.A human shaped pit appeared in the ground.In the hands of this burly man, a Level 9 Qi Condensation cultivator like Zhou Wei was rendered helpless like a baby!Zhou Wei laid helplessly in the pit, foaming blood from his mouth with his eyes rolled back. Most of his bones were broken and his organs crushed as he fainted right then. His body was the only thing moving as it convulsed subconsciously.After smashing Zhou Wei, the burly man moved and his gaze shifted to two Level 8 Qi Refinement Warriors.The two of them felt the blood drain from their face and without hesitation, tried to soar into the skies.However, the burly man was faster than them and with a lightning leap, he yanked the both of them down from midair!Bang! Bang!It was the exact same situation.Both of the Spirit Peak disciples fainted on the spot after being smashed by the burly man.\u201cYikes!\u201dThe remaining two Spirit Peak disciples were pale as a sheet as they summoned a flying sword before pointing their fingers at the burly man. Instantly, the flying swords turned into streams of light that shot out.One of them was aimed at the burly man\u2019s glabella while the other targeted his chest \u2013 those were both fatal areas!Giving off a malicious grin, the burly man did not try to dodge as he dashed towards them.When the two Spirit Peak disciples saw that, they heaved a sigh of relief.That mysterious man was an idiot with brute strength after all. This was someone that did not know how strong cultivators were such that he didn\u2019t even know to dodge against flying swords.Clang! Clang!A clanging sound rang off when they met with the burly man\u2019s glabella and chest!The flying swords were sent flying instead!Without the slightest bit of damage, the burly man continued rushing towards the two men.\u201cM-Monster!\u201dOne of the Spirit Peak disciples yelled out in a quivering tone. His face was totally pale \u2013 he was so scared he forgot he had to run away anymore.The other disciple controlled the flying sword beneath his feet and ran as far as he could.With a casual punch, the burly man knocked the frozen disciple away. He then continued running on all fours, leaving nothing but shadows as he chased after the escaped disciple.With a rapid leap, he hopped around a couple of towering ancient trees to close the height distance.\u201cCome on down!\u201dLaughing, the burly man gripped the disciple\u2019s calf and yanked him down from midair.Snap!That single grip by the burly man snapped the disciple\u2019s calf on the spot.\u201cAh!\u201d Ah! \u201cAh!\u201dSweating pouring down his forehead, the disciple howled in pain.Whisking that disciple, the burly man returned to their original place and grabbed the other four who had passed out. Carrying three on one hand and two on the other, he sped outside in huge steps.\u201cW-Who are you?\u201d\u201cWe are disciples of Ethereal Sect! How dare you attack us! Our sect will definitely not let you off if they know about it!\u201dGuo Chong, who was the only disciple awake, yelled at the burly man.The burly man remained silent as he dashed through the forest.Guo Chong found himself getting more fearful by the moment as he said in trembles, \u201cW-Where are you taking us to?\u201d\u201cSir, please let us go.\u201d\u201cSir, I know I\u2019m in the wrong now.\u201dSuddenly, the burly man halted in his tracks and looked down at Guo Chong icily, asking coolly, \u201cWhat did you do wrong?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2026 I\u2026!\u201dGuo Chong was stumped by the question.He had only mentioned it out of nervousness previously but he did not know what he had done wrong!Guo Chong cursed internally as he did not know where this burly man had spouted out from! Without saying anything, the latter started striking at them and this person was unreasonably strong!None of their cultivation methods had worked on this burly man at all!After the burly man stopped in his tracks, he tossed all five of them on the ground and turned to leave without saying anything more.A look of disbelief spread past Guo Chong\u2019s face.They were alive?The burly man did not kill them!Guo Chong looked around. They were outside the Great Rock Forest right now and he did not know why the burly man had brought them out and left them here before leaving himself.\u201cSir, may I know your name and the sect you\u2019re from?\u201d Guo Chong shouted out indignantly.Suddenly, the burly man stopped in his tracks and turned around before walking towards him once more.Guo Chong broke into a shudder, wishing that he could slap himself on the mouth as he hurriedly said, \u201cSir! I really know where I\u2019ve gone wrong this time round! I should not have asked for your name\u2026!\u201dArriving before the five of them, the burly man grabbed their storage bags and took away all their spirit stones and elixirs before keeping them in his own storage bag.Looking at his robbed empty storage bag, Guo Chong wanted to break out in tears.Snickering, the burly man turned towards Great Rock Forest and disappeared in the blink of an eye.Guo Chong opened his storage bag with shaking hands and dug out a paper crane, writing on it with spirit qi. \u201cWe\u2019ve been attacked at Great Rock Forest. The opponent is unknown and extremely strong. Please send reinforcements from the sect!\u201dInjecting spirit qi to it, the spirit crane spread its wings and transformed into a beam of light, disappearing into the skies.Guo Chong was injured as well and was unable to carry the other four back, merely able to wait there for the sect\u2019s reinforcements.Looking at his fellow fainted disciples, he felt despair swallowing him from within.The thought of his savings for the past few years being robbed completely by some unknown mysterious burly man had him howling out in sadness, \u201cI\u2019m innocent!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If all five of them were to deny it, he could do nothing about it too.Instead, he might even be the one punished for injuring them so badly.At the same time, Su Zimo\u2019s ace in the bag was his strength at melee combat and he did not wish to have it revealed so early.Furthermore, all he had to do was change his appearance and identity and that would be reason enough for him to loot their spirit stones and elixirs entirely.While they might feel wronged about it, they would have nowhere to complain.After all, the mysterious burly man did not exist in this world.As he approached the core of the forest, Su Zimo kept his flying sword and landed on the ground.Danger lurked all around within the forest and Su Zimo was much more agile on the ground than the flying sword. If he met with any danger, he would be able to dodge it at the first instance.Along the way, he could sense the auras of spirit beasts.However, Su Zimo did not engage in battle and instead chose to avoid them, sprinting towards the core region of Great Rock Forest.There was a forest of ores not too far away.There, pure gold laid abundantly on the ground and shimmered brightly as Su Zimo tread over carefully.He could sense a hint of danger within the forest.There was definitely some extremely strong spirit beast or demon reigning over the area!Within the middle of the forest beside a large pure gold ore, a spirit beast with a thick armor sprawled on the ground. Its armor shone with a luscious shade of gold, covering its neck and limbs while its tail was filled with spikes.Goldeater Beast!Surviving by devouring all sorts of spirit materials and ores, it possessed a cruel nature and an immense strength. Invulnerable to weapons, there was almost no weakness to it.It was clear that the Goldeater before them was almost at the realm of a spirit demon!This was troubling.Su Zimo frowned.If it was any other spirit beast, he had the confidence of killing it there and then. However, he had no way of dealing with this Goldeater at all.Suddenly, the Goldeater which was initially fast asleep opened its eyes and glared at Su Zimo sharply with an immense killing intent!\u201cRoar!\u201dRising in the blink of an eye, it hollered in the direction of Su Zimo and sprinted over.Narrowing his gaze coldly, Su Zimo pushed his feet and activated the Plow Heaven Stride. Instantly, two deep ravines appeared beneath his feet on the ground as the mud flipped over.Against the pounce of the Goldeater, Su Zimo held his ground firmly as his aura began to rise. Right after Plow Heaven Stride, he leaned forward with Mountain Reliance!Bang!The man and beast had collided into one another!Su Zimo was knocked half a step back while the Goldeater was sent flying away, only stopping after crushing through a number of gold ores.\u201cHaha!\u201dSu Zimo burst out in laughter.It was at that moment that he realized his physique had evolved to a terrifying degree after he tempered it using spirit qi with the foundation of The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness.Even the Goldeater\u2019s strength was not enough to withstand an impact against him!A trace of fear flickered through the Goldeater\u2019s eyes.Activating Divine Steed Fleeting, Su Zimo appeared before the Goldeater in the blink of an eye as he retrieved the Cold Moon Saber from his storage bag and slashed towards its head.Clang!Sparks flew everywhere.The Cold Moon Saber rebounded and the Goldeater was totally unharmed.At the same time, it shook its spiked tail and swept through the air, landing squarely on Su Zimo\u2019s chest.With lightning speed, Su Zimo mentally cultivated his Body Petrification, causing his flesh to expand and his muscles to harden.Bang!Su Zimo fell over, slamming onto the biggest pure gold ore in the middle of the forest, causing cracks to form densely on it.The Goldeater glared at the ore behind Su Zimo and looked a little unnerved.Rubbing his chest, Su Zimo kept his Cold Moon Saber.The Cold Moon Saber was no longer useful \u2013 Su Zimo could only use his own strength to fight against the Goldeater!Once more, the man and beast fought to a corner.Opening its mouth, the Goldeater chomped at Su Zimo, aiming for his neck.Without fear, Su Zimo suddenly reached out with both hands and grabbed the upper and lower jaws of the Goldeater, yanking it with ferocious force!Psst!Heaving a deep breath of air, mighty as the Anaconda Eclipse, his chest puffed up robustly as he spun around mightily. It was a frightening sight as green veins popped up all over his arms like snakes coiling around it.\u201cOpen up!\u201dWith a holler, Su Zimo continued to tear.Shing!Blood filled the entire place as organs fell to the ground, creating a foul stench all around.The Goldeater was torn into half by Su Zimo!Breathing heavily, he tossed the corpse of the Goldeater away casually and began collecting the gold ores around.\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s eyes lit up.Within a shattered pile of gold ores stood a large Pure Gold Crystal; it illuminated with a mysterious gleam and was almost transparent.\u201cPure Gold Crystal!\u201dSu Zimo exclaimed.A Pure Gold Crystal was an extremely rare item amongst gold ores and was hard to produce. At the same time, it was a crucial material for the refinement of middle or even superior-grade spirit weapons.\u201cI\u2019m going to be rich!\u201dHis head went into a frenzied excitement as he kept the Pure Gold Crystal that was around the height of an average man in his storage bag.Su Zimo then shattered all the other gold ores around but he found no more Pure Gold Crystals.Even then, his reward for this trip was far more than he had imagined.After collecting all the gold ores around, he turned around to leave.Before long, a green robed scholar carried a spirit tiger on his left arm and a spirit leopard on his right, walking out of the forest.\u2026At the same time, the spirit crane that Guo Chong sent back to Spirit Peak caused quite a stir.An elder of Spirit Peak headed towards Great Rock Forest personally with a group of disciples.Weapon Peak.Out of extreme boredom, the disheveled old man was out roaming around the top of the peak. Arriving at the mission stele, he raised his head and remarked in soft surprise, \u201cThe mission for Great Rock Forest\u2019s given out? Do we have such promising disciples that would head there?\u201dElder Liu beside the mission stele opened his eyes lazily and harrumphed, \u201cSome brazen lad at Level 5 Qi Condensation went there alone. I had to give him a spirit crane in case he gets into trouble.\u201d\u201cLevel 5 Qi Condensation?\u201dThe disheveled old man frowned. As though he recalled something, he suddenly yanked Elder Liu\u2019s wrist. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of that lad?\u201d\u201cSu Zimo or something.\u201dPiak!The disheveled old man slapped on the desk heavily, scaring Elder Liu so badly that he woke up right away.\u201cAre you crazy?! What\u2019s with that?!\u201d Elder Liu glared and scolded.\u201cYou\u2019re the crazy one!\u201dThe disheveled old man yelled back, \u201cThat lad\u2019s the only one in Weapon Peak that can cultivate a Level 3 Spirit Fire but you bloody let him go to Great Rock Forest alone?! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the one that cultivated the Level 3 Spirit Fire?\u201d Elder Liu was stumped too.With a grim expression, the disheveled old man exclaimed, \u201cSleep, sleep and sleep! That\u2019s the only thing you know to do day and night! That lad\u2019s our only hope for Weapon Peak! If anything happens to you, I\u2019ll never let you off!\u201dStunned for a moment, Elder Liu leapt to his feet and urged, \u201cL-Let\u2019s not waste anymore time! Hurry to Great Rock Forest and save the lad!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - The Mind of a Spirit TigerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn order to avoid Zhou Wei\u2019s gang, Su Zimo made a detour intentionally and he somehow ended up avoiding the elder of Spirit Peak as well as the disheveled old man too.When he returned to Weapon Peak and wanted to hand in the mission, he realized that Elder Liu had disappeared.\u201cWhere\u2019s Elder Liu?\u201d Su Zimo asked some of the Weapon Peak disciples passing by.\u201cI\u2019m not sure either but I saw him quarreling with master before the both of them left in a hurry. I\u2019ve got no idea where they went,\u201d The disciple shook his head.Su Zimo did not think too much about it and returned to his cave abode with the spirit tiger and leopard.Both beasts had already attained spirit intellect and had wisdom equivalent to that of a grown man. Their eyes revealed a deep fear as they were brought back to Su Zimo\u2019s cave abode.The beasts knew that even for human cultivators, their bodies were weak.Yet, this man before them was different!His body was even stronger than theirs!Neither the spirit tiger or leopard knew why this man wanted to take them back to his cave abode.\u201cKill us? Eat us? Force us to a blood oath to enslave us?\u201d\u201cOr\u2026\u201dThe spirit tiger shrugged its head as though it thought of something. When it saw the strange look in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes, shivers broke down its spine. \u201cCould this man have some sort of special fetish?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over! I\u2019ve kept my chastity for so many years! Am I going to lose it to a human\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the spirit tiger was terrified after being convinced that it knew what Su Zimo was up to.Indignant, the spirit tiger looked at Su Zimo with a sad and begrudging gaze containing complex emotions.That gaze sent goosebumps across Su Zimo\u2019s back as well as he slapped casually. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you.\u201dThat slap merely made the spirit tiger feel even more aggrieved.\u201cIt\u2019s really over! Not only does this man want to do \u2018that\u2019 to me, he\u2019s spanking me\u2026\u201dAn influx of emotions gushed into the spirit tiger\u2019s heart as two hot streams of tears almost filled its face.At the side, the spirit leopard stayed silently without budging. However, its eyes would flicker with a ferocious look every now and then.Su Zimo came before the two spirit beasts and said gruffly, \u201cBoth of you, cry out.\u201dSpirit tiger: \u201c\u2026\u201dSpirit leopard: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe spirit tiger lamented in his heart. \u201cThis man\u2019s fetish is really kinky. He wants us to cry out before doing \u2018that\u2019 to us!\u201dThe spirit leopard did not dare to wait as it cried out softly.It was a sound as soft as a mosquito, unlike the earthshaking howls often made by spirit beasts in the forests.The reason why Su Zimo had brought the spirit tiger and leopard back was because he wanted to unravel the secret behind their noises as required by the Marrow Cleansing section.However, the spirit leopard was already terrified after being beaten up by Su Zimo. How would it dare to roar in his face? Wouldn\u2019t that be courting death?Su Zimo was stunned for a moment as he looked at the spirit tiger subconsciously.It broke into a shudder and sighed internally. \u201cSigh, look how imposing he is. This is where my reputation ends. From now on, I\u2019m his.\u201dSprawled on the ground, the spirit tiger leaned towards Su Zimo and winked its eyes. With slight embarrassment and shyness, it cried out.\u201cMeow!\u201dAfter crying out, it even looked at the spirit leopard with glee as though it was implying. \u201cSee that? That\u2019s the way you cry out!\u201dFor some reason, Su Zimo felt all his goosebumps rising with that cry as he kicked out instinctively!Bang!Before the glee disappeared from the spirit tiger\u2019s eyes, it was sent flying by Su Zimo\u2019s kick.The spirit leopard\u2019s mouth opened widely as it nearly burst out into laughter.Leaping up, the spirit tiger was enraged and hollered internally. \u201cBloody hell! I\u2019m not giving in anymore!\u201dHowever, when it met with Su Zimo\u2019s cold gaze, the spirit tiger\u2019s courage disappeared as it sprawled on the ground and purred out coyly once more.At this point, it had none of the ferociousness and might a king of the forest should have. If he hadn\u2019t seen and heard it himself, Su Zimo might have thought that he had captured a large kitten instead of a tiger.Even though the spirit tiger was indignant, Su Zimo was even more troubled.He wanted to unravel the secrets of the Marrow Cleansing section through these two beasts but yet, he had caught two unusual beasts.The spirit leopard was slightly more normal albeit cowardly.But, the spirit tiger was just in heat right now\u2026!And the weirdest thing was that this spirit tiger was a male!Looking at the two spirit beasts moodily, Su Zimo wondered if he should slay them for food instead.The two spirit beasts had sharp senses. As though they could sense Su Zimo\u2019s killing intent, both sprawled onto the ground and cried pitifully in horror.Sighing internally, Su Zimo knocked that thought out of his head for now.\u2026Great Rock Forest.Elder Pei Fu of Spirit Peak arrived at Great Rock Forest with 12 inner sect disciples and saw Zhou Wei\u2019s gang.By now, all of them had already woken up. However, because they were injured severely, none of them could move and were moaning on the spot fraily.After arriving, Pei Fu swept his gaze across them. He only relaxed after ascertaining that they were not in mortal danger as he asked grimly, \u201cWhat happened? Who did this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201dGuo Chong was on the brink of tears as he cried indignantly, \u201cThe five of us merely came by Great Rock Forest\u2019s area for a stroll. However, a burly man with a bare upper body appeared out of nowhere and without saying anything, beat the five of us up!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cWhich sect is he from?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201dPei Fu barked, \u201cWhat do you know then?!\u201d\u201cI only know he\u2019s a burly man\u2026\u201dPei Fu went silent for a moment before asking again, \u201cWhat\u2019s the cultivation of the other party?\u201d\u201cPerfected Qi Condensation,\u201d Guo Chong replied instantly.In reality, the five of them knew that the other party was only at Level 5 Qi Condensation. However, if word were to spread within the sect that five disciples of Spirit Peak were beaten up by a burly man of Level 5 Qi Condensation, they would turn into a laughing stock!That was why the five of them had already decided beforehand that they would insist the other party was a Perfected Qi Condensation.Frowning, Pei Fu asked, \u201cBut your injuries don\u2019t seem like they were inflicted by a cultivator?\u201d\u201cElder, you don\u2019t understand. That person must have cultivated some sort of body tempering technique such that he is extremely strong in melee combat! My flying sword couldn\u2019t even scratch him!\u201d Guo Chong explained hurriedly.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys consuming any elixirs after being injured so badly then? You\u2019re waiting for death?\u201d\u201cThe burly man robbed out storage bags clean and we\u2019re only left with a couple of pseudo spirit weapons now\u2026\u201dSighing, Pei Fu gestured with his hand.The inner sect disciples behind him rushed up right away and took out their jade bottles, pouring some elixirs to feed the five of them.Right then, two figures appeared through the air and arrived before them with lightning speed.They were Weapon Peak\u2019s master, the disheveled old man and Elder Liu.The disheveled old man furrowed his brows. \u201cWhy are you guys here?\u201dPei Fu sighed, \u201cOur disciples met with an attack and we\u2019re here for reinforcements. Why are you guys here? Don\u2019t tell me a disciple of Weapon Peak met with danger too?\u201dThe disheveled old man and Elder Liu exchanged glances as they cast a worried look at Guo Chong\u2019s gang before asking darkly, \u201cHave you guys seen our trial disciple, Su Zimo?\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dSlightly guilty, Guo Chong pointed towards Great Rock Forest. \u201cI saw him entering Great Rock Forest and he hasn\u2019t come out yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201dBoth the disheveled old man and Elder Liu felt their hearts sinking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That trial disciple of yours\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the only one in Weapon Peak that can cultivate a Level 3 Spirit Fire,\u201d The disheveled old man\u2019s tone was grim.\u201cLevel 3 Spirit Fire!\u201dPei Fu exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve also heard the news that a weapon refinement prodigy appeared in Weapon Peak. So, that\u2019s Su Zimo.\u201dElder Liu replied darkly, \u201cWe\u2019re headed into Great Rock Forest. I won\u2019t believe it unless I see the lad\u2019s corpse for myself.\u201dPei Fu replied, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll accompany you guys.\u201dHe had the inner sect disciples behind him escort Zhou Wei\u2019s gang back before heading into Great Rock Forest together with the disheveled old man and Elder Liu.The three of them split up and looked around for an entire day to no avail. Finally, they arrived at the core region of Great Rock Forest to find the two halves of the Goldeater\u2019s corpse.\u201cThis Goldeater\u2019s almost reaching a spirit demon realm, but it was killed here.\u201d\u201cLook at the tragic state of its body. It\u2019s almost as though it was torn apart entirely. What ferocious strength!\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dPei Fu murmured softly before saying apprehensively, \u201cCould it be the burly man?\u201d\u201cWhat burly man?\u201d The disheveled old man asked.Pei Fu related the assault of the five men before continuing grimly, \u201cBased on what Guo Chong said, the burly man is extremely strong in melee combat with tremendous strength. Be it whether he\u2019s of another sect or some practitioner of the dark path, this matter is not to be taken lightly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the burly man did not intend to kill or Guo Chong and the others would not have stayed alive.\u201dElder Liu analyzed, \u201cBesides, the burly man brought the five of them out of Great Rock Forest before he left. It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s worried they might be injured by the spirit beasts within Great Rock Forest.\u201d\u201cThat man\u2019s a mystery. We can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s a friend or foe just yet,\u201d The disheveled old man nodded in agreement.At the thought of Su Zimo\u2019s current unknown status of life and death, Elder Liu could not help but feel guilt rise within him and sighed deeply.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s head back,\u201d The disheveled old man gestured with his hand looking all worn out.Even though neither of the three Perfected Golden Cores said anything, all of them had the same thoughts that Su Zimo must have perished so quickly within Great Rock Forest that he did not even have the time to send the spirit crane for reinforcements.In truth, none of them had seen the way Su Zimo dueled with the crane on the cliff to join the sect.If they had witnessed that, they would understand that Su Zimo wasn\u2019t going to die that easily.\u2026Su Zimo did not obtain any insights through the spirit tiger and leopard for two days. Feeling frustrated and remembering that he had yet to hand in his mission for the gold ores, he left his cave abode and headed for the mission stele on his flying sword.There were quite a number of disciples from Weapon Peak gathered around the stele with Xue Yi being one of them.Su Zimo walked over and asked, \u201cElder Liu\u2019s not back yet?\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s been away for two days now and hasn\u2019t returned yet,\u201d Xue Yi nodded.\u201cThen what are you guys looking at?\u201d Su Zimo saw that there were many disciples gathered around the mission stele discussing amongst themselves.Xue Yi pointed to the stele. \u201cTake a look at that first mission.\u201dSu Zimo raised his head.Five Peaks Mission: Search for the mysterious burly man.Beside the mission was a drawing of the appearance Su Zimo had changed into previously.\u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d Su Zimo asked, pretending to be none the wiser.Xue Yi whispered, \u201cI heard that some disciples of Spirit Peak were attacked near Great Rock Forest by this mysterious burly man. He\u2019s said to be extremely strong at a cultivation realm of Perfected Qi Condensation!\u201dSu Zimo snickered internally.Even if they were to deploy the entire sect, they wouldn\u2019t be able to find this mysterious burly man!Swish!Suddenly, the sound of robes slicing the air could be heard.Everyone turned over to see the disheveled old man and Elder Liu speeding through the air and landing on the peak.\u201cMmm?\u201dBoth of them swept through everyone with a casual gaze before stopping at Su Zimo fixedly.Their gaze seemed as though they wanted to eat him up!\u201cYou came back from Great Rock Forest alive, lad?\u201d The disheveled old man grit his teeth and asked, saying each word with a punch.He was pissed! They had spent tireless nights searching for Su Zimo in Great Rock Forest, worried and upset. Yet, unknowingly, the lad had already returned unharmed!Elder Liu was even more pissed.Because of Su Zimo, he was not only scolded badly by the disheveled old man, he was feeling guilty for the past two days.But who knew\u2026 the lad was well and alive here without the slightest bit of remorse!Su Zimo felt goosebumps rising from their stares as he coughed gently and nodded. \u201cYeah, I returned after completing the mission.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201dThe disheveled old man barked, \u201cHow did we not see you along the way to Great Rock Forest?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dPausing for a moment, Su Zimo replied, \u201cI\u2019m only at Level 5 Qi Condensation. In order to conserve spirit qi, I spent half of my journey running on the ground instead of traveling with my flying sword. You guys must have missed me?\u201dUnless there were obstructions, no one would pay attention to the people walking on the ground.That made sense.Both the disheveled old man and Elder Liu could not admit that they had spent all that time outside searching because they were worried for Su Zimo\u2019s safety.It would be embarrassing to admit it!However, that was still a pent up feeling that they had nowhere to vent!Both those sly old foxes exchanged glances and understood the other\u2019s intent without saying anything.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find an excuse to punish this stupid brat!\u201dElder Liu\u2019s eyes shone with craftiness as he put on a stern expression. \u201cLad, you haven\u2019t completed the mission of Great Rock Forest, right? Do you know that there\u2019s a punishment for not completing missions?\u201dFor both of them, the fact that Su Zimo could return alive from the forest was already a blessing \u2013 how could he possibly complete the mission?Besides, both of them had been to Great Rock Forest before and knew that a Goldeater was guarding it. Also, the pure gold mine was already looted clean.However, Su Zimo chuckled. \u201cOut of sheer luck, I\u2019ve managed to complete the mission and not let you guys down.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dThis time round, both of them were the stumped ones.Before they even realized what was going on, Su Zimo had retrieved a lump of pure gold ores from his storage bag which was enough to form a small mountain slightly taller than a man.The disheveled old man and Elder Liu were not the only stumped ones \u2013 all the disciples around froze as well.One had to understand that a single small piece of pure gold ore was sufficient to complete the mission.However, Su Zimo had brought back a huge lump of it. A huge lump\u2026!What everyone did not know was that the lump they were witnessing was merely a third of what was within Su Zimo\u2019s storage bag.Furthermore, he was hiding the precious Pure Gold Crystal as well!\u201cErr\u2026 \u201dSomewhat stumped, both old men were speechless for a moment.After awhile, Elder Liu gulped and coughed gently. \u201cLad, the mission is\u2026 erm\u2026 pretty well done. Cough, cough.\u201dElder Liu wanted to nitpick at Su Zimo but he truly found himself incapable of doing so at the sight of the huge lump of gold ores.The disheveled old man furrowed his brows and asked, \u201cLad, did you see the Goldeater beside the gold mine?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dSu Zimo nodded. \u201cWhen I arrived there, I found the Goldeater killed already. Since there were still quite a number of gold ores left, I brought them all back.\u201cWhat the f*ck?\u201dBoth old men rebutted internally, \u201cThat lad\u2019s luck is way too bloody good, isn\u2019t it\u2026?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then returned to his cave abode.Watching Su Zimo leave, both old men could not help but lament in deep thoughts.\u201cThere\u2019s no wonder why he\u2019s the man who could cultivate a Level 3 Spirit Fire. Even his luck is beyond others,\u201d The disheveled old man pouted his lips.\u201cYes.\u201dElder Liu continued, \u201cThose trial disciples of Spirit Peak that went to Great Rock Forest were not low in cultivation realms but yet they were injured badly. But this lad? Not only did he not bump into that mysterious burly man, he even managed to go through Great Rock Forest entirely while returning peacefully with all those pure gold ores with just a Level 5 Qi Condensation. What else do you call that if not luck?\u201dThe disheveled old man remarked in pity, \u201cActually, given his gift for refining weapons, it\u2019ll be best for him to join True Fire Sect. Our sect isn\u2019t good at weapon and elixir refinement at all. I honestly feel a little bad that we may end up burdening his progress.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not think so much. He\u2019s only just started on weapon refinement and can\u2019t even create an inferior-grade spirit weapon. Even though our sect doesn\u2019t specialize in weapon refinement, we have the foundation of it too. Let\u2019s think about other stuff in the future,\u201d Elder Liu consoled.Nodding, the disheveled old man lowered his head in deep thoughts.\u2026It was still early when Su Zimo returned to his cave abode.According to his plan, he would spend all his efforts on immortality cultivation during the day be it for raising his cultivation or learning more about weapon refinement. Come nighttime, he would cultivate The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness.Before attaining a core, be it Qi Refinement Warriors or Foundation Establishment Cultivators, they were no different from mere mortals and would still have to rest through sleeping.The common ground between Qi Refinement Warriors, Foundation Establishment Cultivators and mere mortals was still their lifespans.Qi Refinement Warriors and Foundation Establishment Cultivators merely had a slightly longer lifespan than mere mortals who could only live to a hundred plus at best without ailments or accidents.However, demonic cultivation was different.During daytime, most demons would be in hiding and would only roam and hunt for food at night when their energy peaked.In fact, Su Zimo would also be resting come nightfall. However, through the two years of demonic cultivation, he already had the habit of maintaining The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness\u2019s breathing and expiration method even in his sleep.That way, Su Zimo\u2019s demonic cultivation was rising equally without taking up any of his immortality cultivation time.It was just that the lack of progress in the Marrow Cleansing section had caused a bottleneck for his demonic cultivation path.For the next few days, Su Zimo continued forcing the two spirit beasts to cry out continuously.After those few days, the two spirit beasts were so exhausted that their voices were hoarse. However, Su Zimo still had no clue on how to proceed with the Marrow Cleansing section.Even if they were spirit demons, they would be worn out howling like idiots without sleep or food for a couple of days.The spirit tiger and leopard looked absolutely lethargic as they sprawled on the ground sleepily.\u201cSigh, I\u2019ve never met a master so hard to please.\u201dThe spirit tiger sighed. \u201cIf he wanted to kill or chop us up, at least that\u2019d be a swift ending. But what\u2019s the point of torturing us like this?!\u201dThe few days of struggle had Su Zimo tuckered out as well.He wasn\u2019t idling while the two spirit beasts were howling \u2013 he listened intently with all his attention, afraid that he might miss the secret in a lapse.However, the end result was merely complete exhaustion as his eyelids were so heavy that he wanted nothing more than to have a good sleep.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll kill these two tomorrow for food.\u201dLying down on his stone bed, that thought jolted through his mind as he fell into slumber.He was simply way too tired.The moment he closed his eyes, he entered dreamland and his breathing turned heavier, using the breathing and expiration method of the Body Tempering, Tendons Transformation and Body Tempering section subconsciously.The two spirit beasts exchanged glances as though they were relieved of a burden.\u201cThat human finally decided to stop!\u201dThe spirit tiger was so touched that two warm streams of tears flowed down his cheeks as he almost howled out to the skies.If they were to continue pushing on, he would have committed suicide by banging his head against the wall before Su Zimo even killed him!Even though the spirit leopard was exhausted as well, a fierce look rose in its eyes at the sight of Su Zimo sleeping.It was a good chance!Even though both spirit beasts were mentally exhausted, they still had their physical strength. If they could bite through this human\u2019s throat, they could escape from this place!Looking at the spirit tiger, the spirit leopard growled softly.The language between demons was naturally understood by the spirit tiger.Even though the spirit leopard\u2019s suggestion was rather tempting, the spirit tiger did not want to take the risk \u2013 who knew if this human was pretending to be asleep!Furthermore, the only thought on the spirit tiger\u2019s mind was to have a good night\u2019s sleep.Swaying its head, the spirit tiger sprawled on the ground and slept.The spirit leopard looked apprehensive. After a moment, as though it had decided on something, its eyes gave off a feral look. Tiptoeing, it kept its killing intent and crept beside Su Zimo.Looking at Su Zimo\u2019s pale, succulent neck, the spirit leopard opened its mouth slowly.It was certain that its bite would be able to crush even rocks!All of a sudden!As though it had realized something, the feral look in the spirit leopard\u2019s eyes disappeared and was replaced with fear. Its opened jaws closed back slowly, as though it had just yawned instead.Turning around, the spirit leopard\u2019s eyes were filled with horror as it shivered terribly. Sprawling down on the ground, it turned to look at the sleeping Su Zimo quiveringly, not daring to attempt anything anymore.\u2018He\u2019s awake!\u2019Those were the two words in the spirit leopard\u2019s mind.As it was about to chomp down, it realized that unknowingly, the human\u2019s breathing methods had changed.That change caused the spirit leopard to break out in sweat.It no longer dared to try anything funny as it laid there obediently, falling asleep after wild thoughts ran through its mind.In truth, Su Zimo had woken up the moment the killing intent in the spirit leopard rose.That was because Su Zimo\u2019s spirit perception was way too frighteningly keen \u2013 the cicada senses autumn coming before the wind even starts to blow. Even back in the Cang Lang Mountain Range, the spirit monkey could barely sneak an attack in, let alone this spirit leopard.Since he was going to kill the two spirit beasts the next day anyways, Su Zimo couldn\u2019t be bothered to make a move and continued sleeping.Come midnight, Su Zimo and the two spirit beasts were fast asleep.As the spirit tiger slept, a weird noise came from its nose.\u201cHuff\u2026 huff\u2026 huff\u2026\u201dAfter the spirit leopard fell asleep, a sound came from its nose as well, different from the spirit tiger\u2019s.\u201cMmm\u2026 mmm\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201dBoth sounds were unique and were neither loud nor soft. Superposing, they reverberated through the cave abode.Right then, a mysterious change happened in Su Zimo\u2019s body!It was as though both sounds carried a strange energy that could penetrate through the flesh and tendons, permeating to the bones and moving the marrow within!Gurgle, gurgle!Through the vibrations of the two sounds, a rumble like the sound of running water rang out from his marrow, soothing to one\u2019s ears.Su Zimo who was in deep sleep felt as though he had just been in a dream as he witnessed the marrow liquid within his bones flowing and gushing squeezing through it, forming blood that seeped into his blood and veins.\u201cMmm?\u201dHe bolted wide awake in shock with widened eyes \u2013 the sound of tigers and leopards!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Feeling the sensation of the flow in his marrow, a series of realizations came through to him like seeds germinating.This was the reason why The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness was getting more difficult to cultivate \u2013 it was a process of internalizing external qualities.The skin was the first to be tempered, followed by the flesh, tendons, bones. After that sequence, the marrow would be refined \u2013 that was the Marrow Cleansing section.External cultivation techniques were relatively easier to master.That was because apart from sutra, breathing and expiration methods as foundation, there were other killing techniques used to refine one\u2019s skin, flesh, tendons and bones.Take the Tri Bovine Style for example. Continuous cultivation of it would result in refinement of the skin while the three styles of the Divine Steed would help to refine the bones.However, from the Marrow Cleansing section onwards, the mystic classic no longer had any killing techniques \u2013 everything would have to depend on Su Zimo\u2019s power of understanding to grasp the profoundness of the sutra.It wasn\u2019t because the mystic classic was incomplete. Rather, it was because one would not be able to achieve cleansing of their marrow through the mere use of physical techniques!The marrow was located within the bones. External techniques were able to refine one\u2019s bones at best and could not reach deeper.That was why another method was required to make use of other forms of energy to refine the marrow.And\u2026 that energy was none other than the sound of tigers and leopards!Actually, Su Zimo was no stranger to such sounds. Back in Ping Yang Town, Su Xiaoning had once raised a kitten.The kitten was expressionless and would never speak. However, a rumbling sound could be heard from within its body every now and then, similar to this sound of tigers and leopards.But of course, be it spirit tigers or leopards, neither of them had the knowledge of the Marrow Cleansing section\u2019s sutra and hence, their marrows would never ever be stronger than Su Zimo\u2019s.The sound of tigers and leopards was merely a turning point of the Marrow Cleansing section.The true profoundness of it laid within the sutra.Su Zimo recalled the sutra of the Marrow Cleansing section and started imitating the sound of tigers and leopards.\u201cHuff\u2026 huff\u2026 mmm\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201dThrough repeated imitations and attempts, Su Zimo\u2019s body started giving off a unique vibrating sound too.The reverberation of the sound caused his marrow liquid within his bones to flow, churning at a rapid speed while producing blood that seeped into Su Zimo\u2019s blood and veins.The true meaning of Marrow Cleansing was to swap blood.Through vibration of the marrow, new blood that was stronger than Su Zimo\u2019s existing blood would be formed!According to the Marrow Cleansing section, an initial success would be enough to kill off an early-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivator. At phenomenal success, one could kill off mid-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivators with ease and could even match against late-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivators!That was how frightening the blood swapping of Marrow Cleansing was!Be it tempering of the body, tendons or bones, those were external strengths at the end of the day.From the Marrow Cleansing section on, Su Zimo would be cultivating a strength that comes from within \u2013 the power of blood!Back in the Cang Lang Mountain Range when he was being hunted by the Foundation Establishment Cultivators of Joyful Clan, he had only managed to escape at the brink of death with the Sanguine Ape Transformation.The reason why the Sanguine Ape Transformation was able to receive such a tremendous amount of power within a short period of time was due to the Power of Blood.That was also why Su Zimo turned weaker after the Sanguine Ape Transformation \u2013 he had yet to start on the Marrow Cleansing section back then and his body could not bear the immense burden at that time.From now on, the same situation would not happen again.After the Marrow Cleansing section, the Sanguine Ape Transformation would no longer be of any use to Su Zimo.After all, with just an initial success of the Marrow Cleansing section, every channel of his blood would send forth a horrifying amount of power!In the blink of an eye, the night had passed.He had already gotten a rough grasp of the sound of tigers and leopards.Standing up, Su Zimo\u2019s heart was filled with joy and his previous disappointment had cleared completely.He had finally made progress on the Marrow Cleansing section after being stuck for so long.Looking at the spirit tiger and leopard, Su Zimo smiled; the thought of killing them had disappeared too.No matter what, both beasts had credit for his newfound understanding of the Marrow Cleansing section.The two beasts had woken up long ago as well. When they saw Su Zimo smile, a shiver ran down their spines as they shuddered.Neither of them had seen Su Zimo smile before.But, now all of a sudden, he was smiling\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over! That human is going to lay his hands on me now!\u201d The spirit tiger cried internally.For the spirit leopard, it was more of guilt.It had nearly died on the spot for its killing intent the previous night. Right now, its head was lowered, not daring to look at Su Zimo.Su Zimo walked forth, whisking the spirit tiger in his left arm and spirit leopard on his right before leaving his cave abode and heading to the front peak.Crossing the thick fog, he arrived before the sect and placed the two spirit beasts down. \u201cYou guys can leave.\u201dSpirit tiger: \u201c\u2026\u201dSpirit leopard: \u201c\u2026\u201dBoth beasts were stunned and did not realize what was going on.He was letting them off just like that?Even after a while, both beasts laid sprawled on the ground, obediently still like little kittens.Su Zimo smiled and waved his hand. \u201cGo on and leave. You\u2019re not allowed to harm others from now on.\u201dThis time round, the beasts could tell of the casualness in Su Zimo\u2019s tone.The human seemed as though he was truly sincere about letting them go?The spirit leopard got up slowly and moved a little. Upon seeing no reaction from Su Zimo, it headed into the distance.After taking a couple of steps, the spirit leopard turned around hurriedly and was only relieved after seeing that Su Zimo had not caught up to it.Even so, the spirit leopard did not dare to run and merely trod further away in small steps, turning back from time to time.The spirit tiger did not move and watched Su Zimo with slightly agape jaws.Su Zimo asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you leaving?\u201dThe spirit tiger grinned widely in a seducing manner and even wagged its tail.The moment it did that, the spirit tiger\u2019s heart skipped a beat as it scolded itself internally, \u201cBloody hell! I\u2019m the king of the forest! Why am I wagging my tail like a dog!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not leaving, I am.\u201dWith that, Su Zimo turned towards the fog.Hesitating for a moment, the spirit tiger chased after him.\u201cMmm?\u201dLooking at the spirit tiger behind him, Su Zimo smiled. \u201cWhy? You want to follow me.\u201dIt nodded its head hurriedly.The spirit tiger lamented internally, \u201cWhat kind of a joke is this? This human is so perverted, asking me to cry out repeatedly. How would he let us go so easily? It\u2019s a trap! He\u2019s laying a trap! If we really run, he\u2019ll definitely kill us!\u201dThe spirit tiger turned and looked at the spirit leopard that was walking away warily and mourned in his heart. \u201cBrother leopard, good luck. You\u2019re probably about to die.\u201dThere\u2019s no way Su Zimo knew what the spirit tiger was thinking but since it was so resolute, he brought it with him through the fog formation.Along the way, the spirit tiger waited for Su Zimo to turn back and kill the spirit leopard.However, even by the time they crossed the fog formation, Su Zimo did not seem as though he had the intention of turning back.It was then that the spirit tiger realized that Su Zimo had actually meant to let them off!\u201cF*ck my life!\u201dThe spirit tiger cursed internally as he grit his teeth.\u201cWait, so I was the one who dug a pit and jumped into it myself? I even covered myself in it\u2026!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a chance! Another chance!\u201dThe spirit tiger encouraged itself, ready to run away the moment the opportunity arises.Right then, a Perfected Golden Core streaked through the air. When he caught sight of Su Zimo below, he murmured a soft surprise and changed direction, descending before the man and beast duo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Zimo bowed and greeted.Nodding slightly, the disheveled old man\u2019s gaze turned towards the spirit tiger behind Su Zimo and frowned.Right now, the spirit tiger was in internal turmoil. It was actually looking for an opportunity to run away but an old man popped out of nowhere and by the sound of it, he was the perverted human\u2019s master!Didn\u2019t that mean that he was even more perverted?!\u201cThis pit is getting deeper by the moment. I\u2019m screwed\u2026\u201dFurrowing his brows, the disheveled old man asked, \u201cIs this your spirit beast?\u201dIn the cultivation world, there were many cultivators who kept spirit beasts and in a duel, these beasts played a part in their total fighting strength.Hesitating slightly, Su Zimo nodded.The disheveled old man looked at the spirit tiger and remarked gruffly, \u201cThis spirit tiger has quite an ordinary endowment and there\u2019s nothing special about it. But since you chose it, you\u2019ll have to make a blood oath with it.\u201dSu Zimo remained silent.The disheveled old man continued, \u201cLad, remember. You must be wary of anyone that isn\u2019t of our race. Furthermore, humans and demons take on different paths and it\u2019s hard to change a beast\u2019s nature. Cultivators have naturally weak bodies. If they were to be betrayed out of the blue by a spirit beast that\u2019s constantly around them, it\u2019s easy for them to die to it.\u201dIn the cultivation world, cultivators would always make a blood oath with spirit beasts to prevent any betrayals.With a blood oath, the spirit beasts would die on the spot through a reflux of their own blood if they had any thoughts of betrayal.The rise in strength for a cultivator with a strong, variant bloodline or ancient beast was always obvious.But of course, the difference between both sides must not be overly huge while making the blood oath and neither must the spirit beast resist or it will fail.That was why for some super large sects, they would provide various larvae or eggs of spirit beasts if they were grooming some paragon cultivators.While the spirit beasts were cubs and foolish, the chances of creating a blood oath with them would improve tremendously.Su Zimo had heard Ji Yaoxue mentioning blood oaths before but he was rather resistant towards the idea of it.It wasn\u2019t just because of Die Yue or the fact that he was doing demonic cultivation as well. It was more of the fact that he did not like to be enslaved and neither did he want to do it to others.That was equivalent to taking away the freedom of one\u2019s life.It was even more cruel than killing them.More than that, Su Zimo was willing to get along with spirit beasts in other manners, like the way he did with the spirit monkey.He believed that even without a blood oath, the spirit monkey would not harm him.The disheveled old man thought that Su Zimo\u2019s silence was due to the latter not knowing how to make a blood oath. Chuckling, he pulled out a blank piece of paper from his storage bag and scribbled a couple of incantations on it before handing it to Su Zimo. \u201cHere, learn it. Take it as my gift to you as your master.\u201dIncantations like the blood oath require contribution points to exchange for within the sect. The disheveled old man\u2019s act was equivalent to giving a benefit to Su Zimo in secret.Receiving the paper, Su Zimo nodded in thanks.\u201cAlright, head back then and make a blood oath with this spirit tiger soon. Head to the old man guard and get a spirit beast badge from him too. Don\u2019t drag too long,\u201d The disheveled old man instructed before soaring into the skies and speeding out of the sect.Within Ethereal Sect, even spirit beasts of cultivators had a badge for recognition and free entry and exit of the fog formation.Watching everything unfold before his eyes, the spirit tiger\u2019s blood curdled as it cried internally. \u201cIt\u2019s really over now! I can\u2019t run anymore! Once the blood oath is made, I\u2019ll be HIS tiger from now on\u2026!\u201dSu Zimo summoned his flying sword and the spirit tiger joined him. Before long, they arrived at his cave abode on Weapon Peak.Through the journey, Su Zimo was silent and expressionless.Arriving at his cave abode, Su Zimo gave a casual rub and the paper that contained the blood oath turned into dust, scattering through the air.When the spirit tiger saw that, its jaw dropped slightly apart in shock.It had been watching Su Zimo through the entire journey \u2013 the latter had not taken a look at the blood oath at all.Now that he destroyed the paper, did that imply that he already knew the blood oath?Su Zimo turned around and looked at the spirit tiger indifferently. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a blood oath with you. If you choose to follow me, nod your head. If not, you can leave now.\u201dThe spirit tiger was stunned.A choice!This human could have made a blood oath without it daring to resist at all. Yet, the human had chosen to give it a choice!That gave the spirit tiger an unprecedented sense of respect and trust.\u201cOw! Ow!\u201dSuddenly, blood rushed into the spirit tiger\u2019s head as its mind went blank, causing it to nod furiously like a chicken pecking for rice on the ground.Su Zimo chuckled. \u201cAlright, since you chose to follow me, you can\u2019t betray me. Of course, I\u2019ll treat you the same way.\u201dUnknown to the man and beast, a pair of eyes were concealed within the depths of the clouds above them, watching everything that transpired between them as well as listening in on their conversation.Su Zimo entered his cave abode with the spirit tiger tagging along.Clouds rumbled as a gigantic pair of wings flapped, covering the skies as it flew towards Ethereal Peak.When it returned to this cave abode that now felt familiar after multiple days of torture, the spirit tiger calmed down and was troubled. \u201cBloody hell, what happened to me just now? How did I agree to it so rashly? That guy was clearly just trying to bribe me!\u201d\u201cSigh, how illogical!\u201dThe spirit tiger regretted its decision\u2026However, since it had made a promise, it felt bad to renege on it in the blink of an eye.\u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t do \u2018that\u2019 to me, I can accept even those random cries every now and then. Alright\u2026 I\u2019ll just stay here on that condition for now then. Since we didn\u2019t make a blood oath, I\u2019m free to come and go.\u201dAt that thought, the spirit tiger felt no burden and stayed in Su Zimo\u2019s cave abode for the time being.An additional spirit beast did not affect Su Zimo\u2019s life much.The spirit tiger would head out to look for food every now and then, even bringing some back for Su Zimo.Because Su Zimo had demonic cultivation, he required sustenance through meat as well. The spirit tiger\u2019s actions saved him trouble and helped to conserve the essence of his Scarlet Flame Fruit as well.Su Zimo spent the following period of time cultivating the Marrow Cleansing section while raising his cultivation realm and improving on weapon refinement.After the disheveled old man\u2019s hint, Su Zimo went to look for him at the Weapon Refinement Hall for all doubts and view projections left behind by seniors in the sect at the same time.In this period of time, Su Zimo made tons of improvement for the first four steps of weapon refinement.However, the most crucial step was the fifth one \u2013 spirit gathering.For that, he was still stuck and had no success in creating inferior-grade spirit weapons yet. Instead, his storage bag was now filled with a whole bunch of pseudo spirit flying swords.The disheveled old man had once said that Weapon Refinement Masters would develop a unique sense of spirit perception after a long time of refining weapons and that would help with spirit gathering.For Advanced Weapon Refinement Masters, the chances of them gathering a single spirit pattern to create an inferior-grade spirit weapon was close to 100%.Su Zimo had spirit perception as well, but it was different from the one Weapon Refinement Masters had.He had tried to make use of his own spirit perception for spirit gathering but to no avail.During that period of time, there was another month end test on Weapon Peak. Once again, Feng Haoyu came to Weapon Peak and even sent Qi Refinement Warriors to Su Zimo\u2019s cave abode, challenging the latter.However, Su Zimo refused to see them.The reason why he had taken part in the previous test was because he wanted to observe the projections. But, now that he could view them at any time he wanted, there was no need to waste time on the test.He couldn\u2019t care less about Feng Haoyu\u2019s challenge.What Su Zimo did not realize was that his rejection of the challenge would indirectly lead to the greatest crisis in the history of Ethereal Peak!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Challenge Between Two PeaksPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosIn the blink of an eye, Su Zimo had joined the sect for more than two months.It was already mid of the year by now.This day, Su Zimo was pondering about the technique of spirit gathering in his cave abode when the spirit tiger\u2019s sharp ears heard the sound of Sword Kinesis Flight speeding towards their direction.Before long, his door sounded with hurried knocks.\u201cBro, open up! Are you there?\u201d Little fatty\u2019s voice rang out.Su Zimo sighed \u2013 he was about to make headway when his thought process was broken. Getting off his stone bed, he walked out of his cave abode with the spirit tiger behind him.Because the spirit tiger was even taller than the little fatty and it looked feral, the latter was so scared that he almost fled from the spot on his flying sword.It was only after he saw the spirit beast badge on the spirit tiger\u2019s neck that little fatty calmed down and chuckled. \u201cBro, you\u2019re amazing! You even have a spirit beast now!\u201d\u201cWhat happened? What are you so flustered for?\u201d Su Zimo saw that little fatty\u2019s nose was filled with beads of sweat as though he had rushed over because something had happened.Slapping his forehead, little fatty replied hurriedly, \u201cBro, it\u2019s bad! Weapon Peak\u2019s disciples are fighting with Spirit Peak disciples in our peak\u2019s spirit arena!\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo frowned. \u201cExplain everything clearly. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201dLittle fatty organized his thoughts and related the entire event thoroughly.Su Zimo\u2019s eyes turned colder by the moment.So, he was the cause of the conflict between disciples of both peaks.During this period of time, Su Zimo was always in his cave abode and had rarely appeared. Not only did he not take part in the month end test, he did not even reply to Feng Haoyu\u2019s challenge. However, that made Feng Haoyu feel as though he was being looked down on!It was an absolute disgrace for him!Naturally, disciples of Spirit Peak began to mock that Su Zimo was a coward who did not dare to accept the challenge and whatnot.When disciples of Weapon Peak heard it, they naturally felt uncomfortable as well and because of that, both sides had been engaging in a verbal war for the past period of time.Everything escalated to this day when the fight exploded, causing disciples of both peaks to engage in a challenge.To be honest, other than Su Zimo, none of the Weapon Peak disciples had a heaven spirit root and neither were they well-versed in fighting techniques.Most of the Weapon Peak disciples spent their time raising their cultivation states and refining weapons.Even for Qi Refinement Warriors at the same cultivation realm, Weapon Peak disciples were far inferior compared to Spirit Peak disciples. In fact, even those that were merely a level higher may lose as well.This was a challenge that Weapon Peak could not win!Without saying anything more, Su Zimo summoned his flying sword and said grimly, \u201cGo! To Spirit Peak!\u201dThe spirit tiger leapt on the sword as well \u2013 as Su Zimo\u2019s spirit beast, it naturally had to follow suit.During this period of time, Su Zimo\u2019s had gotten to Level 6 Qi Condensation. At full speed, his Sword Kinesis Flight was almost comparable to little fatty who was Level 7 Qi Condensation!One had to understand that little fatty had a heaven spirit root as well.However, the fact that they had a similar speed implied that Su Zimo\u2019s quality of spirit qi was even higher than little fatty\u2019s!\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dLittle fatty was puzzled.\u201cBro, don\u2019t be rash later on,\u201d They were about to arrive at Spirit Peak and when little fatty saw the coldness in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes, he reminded out of fear that the latter might do anything inappropriate.Su Zimo did not reply.Cultivators were not allowed to fight one another casually within Ethereal Peak. If they had any grudges to settle, they would have to do it in the spirit arena.Each peak had their own spirit arenas located in the westward direction respectively.After all, the westward represented the metal element \u2013 it was a sign to kill!However, even in the spirit arenas, cultivators were not allowed to kill or cripple the other party\u2019s cultivation \u2013 it was only a place to determine the winner.But of course, duels \u2013 especially between cultivators who were evenly matched \u2013 were usually decided through a single crucial moment. It was difficult for anyone to properly hold back their power for those critical moments and the accidents have happened in the spirit arenas before as well.Before long, Su Zimo and little fatty arrived above Spirit Peak. At the westward direction, a large group of people gathered with many disciples looking on.Su Zimo and little fatty descended outside the spirit arena.\u201cMake way, make way!\u201d With his fat body, little fatty paved a path forcefully.Many Spirit Peak disciples were just about to scold him when they caught sight of the spirit tiger behind Su Zimo and got jolted in shock, swallowing their words.In front of Su Zimo, the spirit tiger was tame as a kitten but out here, it was ferocious and mighty, even letting out a feral roar every now and then!Soon, they arrived at the front of the crowd.There were at least 2,000 trial disciples looking on around the spirit arena. It wasn\u2019t just Spirit and Weapon Peak, disciples of the other three peaks had arrived upon hearing the news as well.The stir caused by this challenge had rattled all five peaks!Those that stood at the front of the crowd were naturally the prodigies and talents of every sect. Leng Rou with the ice spirit root was amongst them as well, watching on with her usual coldness.In the spirit arena, a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior of Spirit Peak was engaged in battle against Xue Yi.Xue Yi was at Level 9 Qi Condensation, a realm higher than this person. However, he was being suppressed to a big disadvantage and it was only a matter of time before he lost.A fight between Qi Refinement Warriors was limited where items such as spirit weapons and talismans were not used.Even though they were both riding a single flying sword, the Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior of Spirit Peak clearly had a much better mastery with it as his flying sword pressured Xue Yi endlessly.Xue Yi\u2019s mastery of his flying sword was clearly much clumsier.\u201cThat\u2019s Sun Tao, a heaven spirit root. He\u2019s nothing much in Spirit Peak and only listens to Feng Haoyu. Hmph, bro. Even though I\u2019m only Level 7 Qi Condensation, I might even be able to take down this man too,\u201d Little fatty whispered at the side.Su Zimo nodded his head and looked around, spotting the haughty, purple robed Feng Haoyu standing nearby.Right then, Feng Haoyu turned to look at Su Zimo too.A taunting look flickered through Feng Haoyu\u2019s eyes.\u201cFufu, you\u2019re finally willing to show yourself?\u201dFeng Haoyu scoffed coldly and suddenly declared loudly, \u201cSun Tao, don\u2019t drag this anymore and end it quickly. The \u2018genius\u2019 of Weapon Peak is here to watch.\u201dFeng Haoyu placed particular emphasis on the word \u2018genius\u2019. Right then, countless gazes turned towards Su Zimo.Leng Rou turned slightly and glanced at Su Zimo indifferently before looking back.Despite the intense fight, Sun Tao was still able to afford the distraction of looking out of the spirit arena.After he saw Su Zimo, Sun Tao burst out into laughter and activated some hand seals. His flying sword shone brightly and burst forth with energy, hitting Xue Yi\u2019s flying sword away and piercing towards his heart!Xue Yi\u2019s eyes were instantly panicked. He wanted to dodge but at the sight of the incoming flying sword, his body went slightly stiff instead.Su Zimo narrowed his eyes.Just as the flying sword was about to pierce Xue Yi\u2019s chest, Sun Tao chuckled and adjusted its trajectory upwards.Poof!The flying sword pierced through Xue Yi\u2019s shoulder blade and brought forth a stream of blood.Groaning, Xue Yi was brought to a stagger from the force and fell from the spirit arena.A couple of disciples from Weapon Peak rushed forth to support Xue Yi, applying ointment on the wound to slowly stop the bleeding.The disciples of Weapon Peak watched angrily and shouted as Sun Tao walked slowly off the spirit arena, \u201cThe winner was already decided, why did you still injure him!\u201d\u201cHmph, no one is to blame for his lackluster skills.\u201dSun Tao scoffed coldly, \u201cWeapon Peak is only good at talking. Level 9 Qi Condensation? So, what? Even if you\u2019re a realm above me, you\u2019re nothing in my eyes!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sect\u2019s rules states that cultivators can only spar within the spirit arena.\u201dEven though Su Zimo was only at Level 6 Qi Condensation, for some reason, little fatty always felt that he was extremely strong.Terrifyingly strong.Su Zimo headed up and checked out Xue Yi\u2019s wound.The sword had pierced his shoulder blade and the wound would take at least a month to recover.Xue Yi\u2019s face was pale. When he caught sight of Su Zimo, he forced out a smile. \u201cJunior Brother Su, you\u2019re here too.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dSu Zimo nodded his head. \u201cSenior brother, rest well. I\u2019ll make them pay for this.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201dXue Yi\u2019s expression changed as he tugged at Su Zimo\u2019s arm, shaking his head. \u201cJunior brother, don\u2019t fall into their trap! The reason why they did this was to lure up into the spirit arena so that they can cripple you, rendering you incapable of taking part in the year end face-off.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Junior Brother Su! You don\u2019t have to bother with our affairs. As long as you win Feng Haoyu in the year end face-off, that\u2019ll be as good as making them pay,\u201d The other Weapon Peak disciples chimed in.Su Zimo shook his head.When he saw that, Xue Yi was even more anxious. \u201cJunior brother, you\u2019ve only joined the sect for less than three months so you\u2019ve probably never been to Spirit Peak to learn battling techniques between cultivators. How are you going to fight them? I\u2019m at Level 9 Qi Condensation and I lost, let alone your Level 6. Don\u2019t be silly!\u201dEven though Xue Yi\u2019s words were unkind, he had actually said them out of concern.\u201cHumph\u2026\u201dSun Tao who had exited the spirit arena passed by Su Zimo and the others. When he heard that, he smirked and raised his brow. \u201cIf Junior Brother Su wants to have a fight, we\u2019ve got other Level 6 Qi Condensation disciples in Spirit Peak. If that doesn\u2019t work, how about I get a Level 5 to go against you? How\u2019s that sound?\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dA series of laughter burst forth from the crowd.\u201cJunior Brother Su, I\u2019m only at Level 5 Qi Condensation! I\u2019m willing to spar you in the spirit arena, do you dare to?\u201d A disciple from Spirit Peak stood up.Another Spirit Peak disciple yelled, \u201cJunior Brother Su, we joined the sect at the same time. Even though I\u2019m only at Level 4 Qi Condensation now, I can still be your opponent too!\u201dFeng Haoyu looked at Su Zimo and remarked idly, \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of finding a Level 3 Qi Refinement Warrior as an opponent, then I guess that\u2019s something Spirit Peak doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dThe laughter roared even louder.\u201cThat\u2019s too much!\u201d The disciples of Weapon Peak were so angry that their faces went green.Little fatty sighed at the side.Even though he sided with Su Zimo, he was still someone of Spirit Peak at the end of the day and could not say anything at the moment.Xue Yi clutched his wound and said softly, \u201cJunior Brother Su, let\u2019s head back. Don\u2019t fall for their trap.\u201d\u201cI was the cause of this to begin with so things should end with me.\u201dRight after he said that, Su Zimo turned to look at Feng Haoyu before saying slowly, \u201cFeng Haoyu, for the sake of that fake title of being top of three peaks, you\u2019ve created so much trouble directly and indirectly. I had initially thought that you would be a somebody, but now\u2026\u201dSu Zimo did not continue, merely shaking his head.A gold glare flickered through Feng Haoyu\u2019s eyes as he asked icily, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been wanting to challenge me, right?\u201dSu Zimo continued, \u201cAs you wish. Get to the spirit arena then!\u201dThe voices in the crowd gradually vanished.Everyone looked at Su Zimo in astonishment, unable to believe what they had just heard.Su Zimo wanted to challenge Feng Haoyu?One was at Level 6 Qi Condensation while the other was at Level 8.One was a disciple of Weapon Peak, untrained in fighting techniques, while the other was the number one genius of Spirit Peak!The difference between the two of them was like heaven and earth!Even little fatty was stumped as well.While he believed that Su Zimo was strong, it wasn\u2019t to the extent of Feng Haoyu\u2019s strength.But, the sudden challenge declaration to Feng Haoyu sent little fatty into a fluster.\u201cJunior Brother Su, don\u2019t! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d Xue Yi thought that Su Zimo had issued the challenge because he was young and impetuous.\u201cHAHAHA!\u201dAfter a momentary silence, an even louder roar of laughter burst out from the crowd.Some of the Spirit Peak disciples clutched at their stomachs in laughter. \u201cI can\u2019t do it! This Su Zimo is way too hilarious! He wants to challenge Junior Brother Feng!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I call overestimating one\u2019s strength!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right! How did he manage to even say it out? That guy is real thick, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dFeng Haoyu merely smiled and watched Su Zimo silently.He did not have to say anything. By now, Su Zimo was already a laughing stock of the entire place.Sun Tao said with a stifled chuckle nearby, \u201cAre you even fit to challenge Junior Brother Feng?\u201dSu Zimo eyed him and replied coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, once I\u2019m done with him, you\u2019ll be next.\u201d\u201cRoar!\u201dSuddenly, the spirit tiger lowered its body and gave off an ear-piercing howl, silencing the clamor of the crowd instantly.Many of the disciples that were onlooking were shocked as well, stumbling back instinctively as a stir broke out through the moving crowd.Scouring around the place, the spirit tiger\u2019s aura was ferocious as it looked on with feral eyes and snarling teeth. Some of the female disciples were so rattled that they screamed endlessly.This ended the spirit tiger\u2019s previous depression as it gloated internally.The fact that it was subdued by Su Zimo did not mean that it was weak.On the contrary, it was strong. In fact, a high leveled Qi Refinement Warrior might not even win it in a death bout.Most of the Spirit Peak disciples head out often and have been in many battles including against spirit beasts. Right now, they were much more composed as they realized that this was Su Zimo\u2019s spirit beast from the badge on its neck.Sun Tao narrowed his gaze and sneakily dodged away from the spirit tiger\u2019s line of view. Pulling out a flying sword stealthily, his eyes were filled with malicious intent.Swoosh!The flying sword left his hand and shot out towards the spirit tiger\u2019s head!Sun Tao\u2019s attack was extremely sneaky without any warning at all.Coupled with the fact that there were more than 2,000 people around, the entire place was noisy with auras mixed together. By the time the spirit tiger noticed, the flying sword was already near to it!It was an extremely vicious move that was aimed on killing it without holding back at all.With its life at stake, the spirit tiger leapt to the side and slanted its head as quickly as possible.Shing!A stream of blood flashed by.A long, bloody wound appeared on the body of the spirit tiger as its skin peeled outwards with blood flowing endlessly.\u201cRoar!\u201dCrumbling to the ground, the spirit tiger\u2019s body shivered repeatedly. It howled out miserably with pain in its eyes.\u201cMmm?\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s expression changed as he turned around sharply. Looking at the spirit tiger injured on the ground, his heart was filled with a strong killing intent!The reason why Su Zimo did not realize the danger approaching was because Sun Tao\u2019s attack was not aimed for him. By the time he heard the sound of the flying sword, it was too late.Furthermore, Su Zimo\u2019s attention was focused on Feng Haoyu with his back facing Sun Tao.He had not expected that someone would ignore the rules of the sect and strike outside of the spirit arena!When he saw Su Zimo\u2019s eyes, little fatty\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cShit, something bad is about to happen!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Are. Courting. Death!\u201dA demonic red light shimmered through the depths of Su Zimo\u2019s eyes as he hollered. Suddenly, he arrived in front of Sun Tao within a single step that crossed twenty feet!That was none other than the Plow Heaven Stride.Even though it looked plain, it was intimidating as Sun Tao was so rattled that blood drained from his face. He suddenly felt as though the being before him was not a human, but an ancient beast!Su Zimo\u2019s killing intent was torrential. With a backhand slap, he whipped at Sun Tao\u2019s cheek.Bang!Sun Tao could not fight back at all. The last thing he knew was his vision blackening \u2013 he was knocked down by Su Zimo! Crashing headfirst, a large pit formed around his head as he fainted on the spot with blood oozing from his eyes, nose, ears and mouth!\u201cEh?\u201dAbove the spirit arena somewhere beyond the clouds where the eyes could not reach, a surprised murmur sounded out. A gigantic pair of wings that was barely visible appeared with a pair of eyes observing everything beneath coldly.\u201cWeird. How come that lad\u2019s blood has\u2026\u201dA barely perceivable mutter could be heard from above the skies.At the spirit arena\u2026The entire series of events caused an uproar.It started with Sun Tao\u2019s sneak attack that injured Su Zimo\u2019s spirit tiger. That was something that everything could still accept as reality.But what happened next had them all stunned.By the time little fatty wanted to prevent it, it was already too late.No one had expected that Su Zimo would lay a hand on Sun Tao. Not just that, Sun Tao was knocked out with a single slap and no one knew if he was even alive still!\u201cCareless! It must be out of carelessness!\u201dThat was the first thought across everyone\u2019s mind.Sun Tao was a Level 8 Qi Refinement Warrior of Spirit Peak. The only possibility for him to be defeated by a Level 6 Qi Refinement Warrior of Weapon Peak in a single move must be because he was being careless.\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over! Bro totally ignored the sect\u2019s rules and laid a hand on a fellow sect mate out of the spirit arena! Now, no one even knows if Sun Tao is still alive! This is bad!\u201dLittle fatty scratched his ears and cheeks anxiously, trying to think of a way out of this.\u201cInsolent!\u201d\u201cAudacious!\u201d\u201cSu Zimo, how dare you break our sect\u2019s rules and hurt a fellow sect mate! You\u2019re the one courting death!\u201dMany disciples of Spirit Peak rushed out from the crowd and surrounded Su Zimo, barking at him angrily with unfriendly looks.Watching everything nearby, Feng Haoyu\u2019s eyes filled with a taunting look as he gloated internally. \u201cSeems like I don\u2019t even have to do it personally anymore. What a witless fool, fufu.\u201dSu Zimo\u2019s expression was unchanged as he looked at the surrounding Spirit Peak disciples coldly. Squatting down, he applied ointment to the spirit tiger\u2019s wound.The spirit tiger endured through the pain and looked at Su Zimo with blinking eyes, feeling a sense of warmness gush through its heart.Leng Rou at the side nodded her head in acknowledgment as she saw that too.Everything aside, the fact that Su Zimo could maintain his composure in front of more than a thousand Spirit Peak disciples was proof of his mental fortitude.She acknowledged that she wouldn\u2019t even be able to match Su Zimo\u2019s calmness.\u201cEveryone, please don\u2019t be rash. Don\u2019t get hasty now, guys!\u201dLittle fatty hopped out and bowed to everyone, giggling. \u201cIf you guys make a move, that means that everyone would have broken the sect\u2019s rules too, right?\u201dUpon hearing that, many of the Spirit Peak disciples looked apprehensive as they stood rooted momentarily, feeling embarrassed to strike out.Feng Haoyu\u2019s gaze shimmered as he suddenly leaned and whispered to a Spirit Peak disciple beside him.Nodding in acknowledgment, that disciple rode his flying sword and dashed towards Spirit Peak\u2019s palace.A look of disgust flickered through Leng Rou\u2019s eyes when she saw that.She need not guess further \u2013 Feng Haoyu must have asked that person to snitch so that they could get seniors of the sect to deal with Su Zimo.\u201cSu Zimo, how dare you hurt our people on our premises. Do you really think Spirit Peak is that weak?\u201dJust as both sides were in a stalemate, Feng Haoyu suddenly remarked.When he heard that, little fatty\u2019s heart sank.What a devious man!That statement was clearly meant to stir everyone\u2019s emotions so that Su Zimo would end up fighting with the disciples of Spirit Peak!The graver this matter became, the more severe Su Zimo\u2019s punishment would be!Indeed, right after Feng Haoyu said that, some of the initially hesitant Spirit Peak disciples looked much more resolute. Placing their hands slowly on their storage bags, they were ready to strike at any moment.Finally, one Spirit Peak disciple could hold it in no longer. Confident of his physical strength because he had cultivated a body tempering technique in the past, he harrumphed coldly and walked forth, reaching for Su Zimo\u2019s hair while barking, \u201cSu Zimo! We\u2019re asking you a question! Don\u2019t act mute!\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201dWithout even turning back, Su Zimo flung his arm. Even though it looked flimsy, a loud crack sound akin to that of a whip rang out!Piak!Before that Spirit Peak disciple\u2019s palm could even reach Su Zimo, he was sent flying into the crowd by that slap! His teeth cracked as he coughed out blood, knocking out cold on the ground.Everyone was in an uproar!Little fatty was almost on the brink of tears.He was trying his best to stop the situation from escalating but now, everything he had done was in vain!Su Zimo\u2019s strikes were so swift that no one could react to it at all!Now, he had enraged all of Spirit Peak\u2019s disciples.The many Spirit Peak disciples summoned their flying swords which hovered in the air, ready to strike at any moment!Dozens of Weapon Peak disciples surrounded Su Zimo with their flying swords summoned as well. Both sides were pointing swords at one another as war was on the brink of breaking out!Feng Haoyu\u2019s eyes gloated even merrier.\u201cDon\u2019t fight, don\u2019t fight!\u201dWhen little fatty saw that, he was even more troubled as he took out a huge axe from his storage bag. Pulling out a talisman with his left hand, he slapped it on Su Zimo\u2019s back.Instantly, a barrier of light appeared around Su Zimo\u2019s body.It was a protection talisman.Instead of using it on himself, little fatty gave it to Su Zimo.That act had Su Zimo feeling extremely touched.What little fatty did would undoubtedly offend his fellow disciples of Spirit Peak.\u201cDamned fatty! Which side are you on!\u201d A Spirit Peak disciple shouted.Suddenly, little fatty\u2019s expression turned grim. His smile disappeared as he hollered, \u201cF*ck you! It\u2019s none of your matter whose side I\u2019m on!\u201dThat shout from little fatty caused many Spirit Peak disciples to be stumped.Ever since he had joined the sect, no one had seen little fatty get angry before. He was always smiling and friendly. In fact, he had even more friends than Feng Haoyu.Realizing that he may have acted inappropriately, little fatty pouted his lips. \u201cI\u2019m a fatty and so be it, but I hate people calling me damned fatty\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a shout boomed out from afar.\u201cEveryone, disperse!\u201dA beam of light shot over and appeared above everyone\u2019s head with an early-stage Foundation Establishment Cultivator standing on his flying sword. Behind him stood the Spirit Peak disciple that snitched.\u201cGreetings, Senior Brother Chen.\u201d\u201cGood timing, Senior Brother Chen. Please redress our grievances. Su Zimo of Weapon Peak broke the sect\u2019s rules by assaulting fellow sect mates!\u201dMany disciples of Spirit Peak cupped their fists and greeted, recognizing the man who had arrived.Little fatty whispered hurriedly, \u201cBro, don\u2019t offend this person. He\u2019s an inner sect disciple of the Disciplinary Hall, Chen Yu. He must be here to cause trouble for you because he\u2019s on friendly terms with Feng Haoyu. Please just bear with it.\u201dPausing for a moment, little fatty continued, afraid that Su Zimo might not understand the severity of things, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to offend inner sect disciples. Otherwise, we\u2019ll suffer after we get promoted to the inner sect. Besides, he\u2019s someone of the Disciplinary Hall.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Descending slowly, he surveyed the place and asked sternly, \u201cWho is Su Zimo?\u201dSu Zimo was just done with attending to the spirit tiger\u2019s wound and the red gleam in his eyes had disappeared. Instead, it was replaced with a look of hidden uneasiness.He wasn\u2019t worried about this disciple of the Disciplinary Hall, but something else.When he heard Chen Yu\u2019s question, Su Zimo patted the spirit tiger\u2019s body to comfort it before standing up. Turning around, he replied calmly, \u201cI am.\u201d\u201cI heard that you\u2019ve only joined the sect for less than three months?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201dChen Yu suddenly bellowed out coldly.Su Zimo remained silent.Feng Haoyu\u2019s hands were behind his back with his lips slightly curled, looking on with a hint of mockery.The moment Chen Yu arrived, Feng Haoyu knew that Su Zimo\u2019s reputation was over. He could not think of a way for Su Zimo to get out of this.A ban from the year end face-off was probably the lightest of all punishments for breaking sect rules.For worst case scenarios, Su Zimo could be locked in seclusion indefinitely, have his cultivation crippled or even kicked out of the sect!Chen Yu smirked internally at Su Zimo\u2019s silence and declared, \u201cSu Zimo, you\u2019ve broken our sect rules by hurting your fellow sect mates. In the name of the Disciplinary Hall, I shall cripple you and kick you out of the sect!\u201dThe moment he said that, everyone\u2019s expressions changed.That punishment was way too severe!Even disciples from Spirit Peak felt that it was a little too cruel as they looked at Su Zimo with pity.Anyone who could join Ethereal Sect were all people who had exceptional endowments and mental fortitudes. Yet, he was going to have his cultivation crippled, turning him into a mere mortal. Not just that, he was even going to be kicked out of the sect. That was a blow that no one would be able to accept.Leng Rou frowned and looked at Su Zimo instinctively.To her surprise, the green robed man\u2019s expression had not changed in the slightest bit. His eyes were indifferent as though he hadn\u2019t heard what Chen Yu had said.\u201cIs he utterly dejected or scared silly?\u201dBut Leng Rou wouldn\u2019t have imagined in her wildest imaginations that Su Zimo\u2019s current calmness was because there was no fear in his heart as he had already made up his mind.No one will be able to take away his cultivation!If Chen Yu dared lay a hand on him, he would dare to fight back or even kill!And in the worst case scenario, even if his cultivation was crippled, he could continue with his demonic cultivation. He was not going to let things end so easily today!Little fatty\u2019s expression was worried. After much conflicted thoughts, he could no longer hold it in as he said loudly, \u201cSenior Brother Chen, I think that the punishment is a little too severe. Please show some mercy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Senior Brother Chen. Su Zimo has only joined the sect for less than three months. It\u2019s understandable.\u201d\u201cI agree. Similar things have happened in the past but I\u2019ve never heard of anyone having their cultivations crippled or kicked out of the sect.\u201dMany disciples of Weapon Peak chimed in to speak up for Su Zimo.\u201cHumph!\u201dChen Yu harrumphed loudly and shouted, \u201cAll of you, shut up! Since you guys are not convinced, I\u2019ll explain to you why!\u201d\u201cIgnoring sect rules and hurting fellow sect mates is something that\u2019s subjective. However, this incident nearly escalated to a full out bout between disciples of Weapon and Spirit Peak! That\u2019s unpardonable! If I was slightly later and disciples of both peaks end up fighting with severe injuries, who is going to bear the responsibility?\u201dThe way Chen Yu put it made it seem as though the crime was truly heinous.Suddenly, everyone went silent.Right then, Su Zimo spoke.\u201cBased on what you said, I didn\u2019t start the incident. Everyone saw that I wasn\u2019t the one who started the provocation. Sun Tao was the one who made a move first. If we\u2019re talking about who broke sect rules, he did it first.\u201dWhen he heard that, Feng Haoyu shook his head with a taunting look.\u201cOh?\u201dChen Yu was expressionless as he asked, \u201cSun Tao struck at you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Su Zimo nodded.\u201cBullshit!\u201dChen Yu shouted, \u201cSun Tao clearly struck your spirit beast. The sect decreed that cultivators are not to strike at one another. However, there\u2019s no rules stating that they\u2019re not to strike at spirit beasts. So, Sun Tao\u2019s actions do not equate to a violation of sect rules!\u201dAt that moment, some people finally realized why Sun Tao chose to strike at Su Zimo\u2019s spirit beast instead of him \u2013 it was premeditated. He just probably had not expected to be knocked out by a single slap of Su Zimo.Calmly, Su Zimo replied, \u201cStriking at my spirit beast is the same as striking at me. There\u2019s no difference.\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201dChen Yu scoffed coldly, \u201cHow dare you argue at a time like this. A spirit beast is nothing more than an animal. How dare you break our sect rules to injure fellow sect mates for an animal? That makes your doubly guilty!\u201d\u201cTo me, spirit beasts are no different from people. In fact, some people aren\u2019t even comparable to spirit beasts. At least spirit beasts don\u2019t create internal strife and plot against you.\u201dSu Zimo continued indifferently, \u201cIf spirit beasts are no different from animals to you, then some people aren\u2019t even comparable to animals to me. If I whack those people, so be it then.\u201dWhen he heard that, Feng Haoyu\u2019s expression turned stiff.Those words pierced at his heart like needles.Most people around could tell what Su Zimo meant by those words.Little fatty and Xue Yi could not help but roar in agreement internally.If it was them, they would not be able to rebut the same way in front of someone from the Disciplinary Hall!\u201cWhat a glib tongue you have.\u201dChen Yu\u2019s voice was ice cold as a killing intent rose within him.They were surrounded by trial disciples of all five peaks. Su Zimo\u2019s constant rebuttal caused him to look bad in front of everyone.If he did not exert his authority right now, his image as a disciple of the Disciplinary Hall was going to suffer in the future.\u201cSu Zimo, don\u2019t force me to kill you with my own hands!\u201d Chen Yu narrowed his gaze, no longer hiding his killing intent.Little fatty\u2019s body shuddered as he tugged at Su Zimo\u2019s sleeves, hinting for the latter to not say anything more and let matters get worse.Everyone could tell that if Su Zimo continued, Chen Yu would definitely make a move to kill him right there!Xue Yi looked at Su Zimo nervously, shaking his head fervently.The tension was so high around the spirit arena that the atmosphere felt ice cold.Everything that had happened was beyond everyone\u2019s expectations, including Feng Haoyu.No one expected Su Zimo to be this stubborn and unyielding!Lowering his head, Su Zimo placed his palm on the storage bag and in the blink of an eye, a cold, gleaming saber appeared in his hands!Psst!Everyone gasped.What Su Zimo did was simply way too dangerous \u2013 he was going to get himself killed!Before that thought even dispersed from everyone\u2019s minds, Su Zimo spoke indifferently, \u201cIf you dare lay a finger on me, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dThat was tit for tat!All 2,000 odd disciples of the five peaks broke into an uproar!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Interesting.\u201d\u2026At the spirit arena\u2026All the disciples were in shock. They were not even thinking about how a Level 6 Qi Refinement Warrior could go against a disciple of the Disciplinary Hall.All of their thoughts were on how Su Zimo even had the courage to make such a declaration!There were only two possibilities \u2013 he was either stupid or insane.Everyone looked at Su Zimo as though they were looking at a dead man.Initially, Chen Yu had only wanted to cripple Su Zimo\u2019s cultivation and kick him out of the sect.But now, he could rightfully kill Su Zimo on the spot!\u201cWell, well, well!\u201dChen Yu\u2019s anger turned into laughter as he nodded his head repeatedly, remarking coldly, \u201cTo think that trial disciples of Weapon Peak have fallen to such a state where they don\u2019t even know what\u2019s good for them. Since you want to die, I\u2019ll grant you your wish!\u201dSlapping his storage bag, a flying sword appeared in Chen Yu\u2019s palm.Injecting spirit qi to it, the flying sword shone with a bright gleam as two bedazzling spirit lights appeared on the sword!It was a middle-grade spirit weapon!Su Zimo narrowed his gaze. Right as he was about to move, an authoritative voice boomed out from the skies.\u201cStop!\u201dA shadow appeared and sped over with a frightening speed.Soaring through the skies without the use of any items\u2026 it was a Perfected Golden Core!Chen Yu turned his head slightly and frowned \u2013 he was not going to have the courage to strike in the presence of a Perfected Golden Core.With a dark expression, Chen Yu glared at Su Zimo and suppressed his killing intent for now.The person who had arrived as in his fifties. Arriving in lightning speed, his white robes fluttered loudly, exuding the aura of an immortal descending upon the world.On the sleeves of the man\u2019s white robe was an emblem of a flying sword.It was Spirit Peak\u2019s master, Wen Xuan!Su Zimo had seen this person before at the top of the front peak when he joined Ethereal Peak.\u201cGreetings, master.\u201dThe many disciples of Spirit Peak shouted out.\u201cGreetings, peak master.\u201dDisciples of the other four peaks bowed and greeted as well.The appearance of Spirit Peak\u2019s master naturally meant that there would be no fight. Heaving a sigh of relief, little fatty, Xue Yi and the rest finally looked more relaxed.Spirit Peak\u2019s master would be the one to decide how this matter should be resolved.Su Zimo hesitated for a moment before keeping his Cold Moon Saber.\u201cPeak master, Su Zimo\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I know everything.\u201dChen Yu spoke right away, wanting to explain everything to Wen Xuan but was interrupted by the latter\u2019s wave of his hand.Standing tall in the air, Wen Xuan looked at Su Zimo silently. Even though he looked calm, no one could read his thoughts at all.After a long time, he asked slowly, \u201cSu Zimo, do you acknowledge your wrongdoings?\u201dHearing that, little fatty, Xue Yi and the rest were delighted.That meant that there was a high chance Wen Xuan wasn\u2019t going to punish Su Zimo as heavily as Chen Yu did.Before the joy could disappear from the eyes of little fatty and the rest, Su Zimo\u2019s reply caused their expressions to freeze up.A stir broke out amongst the crowd as well.\u201cI\u2019m not in the wrong.\u201dSu Zimo raised his head and looked at Wen Xuan, replying calmly.If Su Zimo rebutting Chen Yu was understandable, his rebuttal of a peak master was definitely irrational.But in truth, Su Zimo was never a rational man.Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have stood his ground instead of kneeling back in Ping Yang Town against Perfected Cang Lang\u2019s oppression.He would not have headed into Yan City\u2019s capital alone to kill the King of Yan despite knowing of the dangers.He would not have proceeded resolutely despite knowing that there was a high chance he might die in the hands of Joyful Clan\u2019s Foundation Establishment Cultivators.Right was right and wrong was wrong \u2013 Su Zimo was never going to bow down in the face of power!Not too far away, the other four peak masters watched the situation develop.There was no way they did not know about such a huge commotion where disciples of two peaks challenged one another.When he heard Su Zimo\u2019s reply, Array Peak\u2019s master sighed gently. \u201cEven though that lad\u2019s character is stubborn and somewhat unlikeable, it\u2019s really rare. I do admire him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the type of guts and defiance that someone who cultivates should possess. The path of cultivation is one that defies the heavens to begin with.\u201d\u201cEven though that\u2019s true, that lad\u2019s cultivation path will definitely be fraught with obstacles.\u201dThree peak masters discussed amongst themselves as the disheveled old man shook his head without saying anything.It wasn\u2019t appropriate for them to make an appearance since everything was happening on Spirit Peak.\u2026At the spirit arena\u2026After hearing Su Zimo\u2019s reply, Wen Xuan went silent for a moment.\u201cSu Zimo, let me ask you a question.\u201dWen Xuan spoke slowly, \u201cToday, you injured Sun Tao because he injured your spirit beast. If he killed your spirit beast, what would you have done?\u201dAs though it had realized something, the spirit tiger growled softly.It had an intellect equal to that of a grown man and it could tell that if Su Zimo were to bow down in defeat now, he would be able to get off with a light punishment.Its roar was to hold Su Zimo back.Turning to look at the spirit tiger on the ground, Su Zimo suddenly smiled.He already had an answer for that question.Su Zimo was bent on revenge against Perfected Cang Lang for killing his steed, Zhui Feng. Why would things be different now that this spirit tiger was his spirit beast too?\u201cOf course I\u2019ll kill him!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d kill your fellow sect mate for a spirit beast?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cGive me a reason.\u201d\u201cSince the spirit beast chose to follow me, I naturally have to protect it properly too!\u201dRoar! Roar!Ignoring its wound, the spirit tiger struggled to stand up and walked to Su Zimo\u2019s side, growling in deep pain while rubbing its head against his arm.The spirit tiger had never truly decided that it wanted to follow Su Zimo.Besides, it could leave at any moment without the binding of a blood oath.That was until this moment when it had made up its mind to never leave this person for the rest of its life.Even if they had no blood oath, that would be the case.\u2026When the four peak masters heard the conversation, all of them frowned.No matter how much of a ruckus Su Zimo caused in the past, they could overlook it because nothing had blown out of proportion.But the fact that he expressed his willingness to kill a fellow sect mate over a spirit beast was a hard pill for them to swallow.Right then, even the Perfected Golden Cores did not realize that in the depths of the clouds, a hidden pair of eyes was still watching everything silently.When it heard Su Zimo\u2019s reply, the pair of eyes gave a look of slight surprise before turning into a ruminating admiration.\u201cMaster, I think that not only is this man heartless, he\u2019s merciless towards our sect mates as well. We\u2019re bound to be faced with greater turmoil if he remains in the sect.\u201dFinally, Feng Haoyu had spoken up.The meaning of his words was clear \u2013 kick Su Zimo out of the sect!Wen Xuan was silent.Countless pairs of eyes watched him, awaiting his final decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But, do you know why you were asked to join Weapon Peak?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Su Zimo replied.Su Zimo was not the only one; the many disciples around had the same doubts.It was especially so for little fatty and the others who had joined the sect at the same time. All of them had witnessed Su Zimo ascending the peak and passing through the Eight Distresses Formation.It didn\u2019t make sense for someone like that to not join Spirit Peak.\u201cYour killing intent is too strong and you\u2019re too hotheaded. The reason why you were asked to join Weapon Peak and learn about weapon refinement was to train your mind and mow away your rashness. Once you\u2019re ready, you can naturally join Spirit Peak thereafter.\u201dAt that, everyone finally understood.Shaking his head, Wen Xuan\u2019s eyes were filled with pity as he sighed. \u201cBut it\u2019s a pity that you\u2019re still the same despite three months of mowing.\u201dEveryone could tell of the deep disappointment within Wen Xuan\u2019s tone.Pausing for a moment, as though he had made a decision, Wen Xuan took a deep breath and declared, \u201cSu Zimo, trial disciple of Weapon Peak! You have gone against sect rules today and despite nearly causing a huge disaster, you refuse to acknowledge your wrongdoings! As the peak master of Spirit Peak, I declare that you\u2019re forbidden to take a single step into Spirit Peak from now on!\u201dThe 2,000 odd disciples from all five peaks went absolutely silent.That punishment was way lighter than what Chen Yu proposed of crippling Su Zimo\u2019s cultivation and kicking him out of the sect.However, for the trial disciples, a restriction to Spirit Peak merely implied that they wouldn\u2019t get to learn the dueling techniques between Qi Refinement Warriors \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a huge loss.Little fatty, Xue Yi and the rest heaved a sigh of relief.No matter what, being forbidden to enter Spirit Peak was way better than having one\u2019s cultivation crippled and kicked out of the sect.Even though Feng Haoyu was expressionless, he was indignant within.He had plotted immensely to create today\u2019s situation for the sake of getting Su Zimo kicked out of the sect. But, it was all in vain.Even though that punishment seemed heavy, it would not prevent Su Zimo from taking part in the year end face-off. To Feng Haoyu, that wasn\u2019t good news at all.Chen Yu\u2019s face dimmed as well.If not for Wen Xuan\u2019s appearance, Su Zimo would have been a dead man to him!He was a step too late.\u201cIf I had known, I should have just killed him instead of wasting time talking! That bloody brat is so insolent. How dare he go against me!\u201dAt the start, Chen Yu had only appeared as a favor for Feng Haoyu.But now, it was personal.All the disciples looked at Su Zimo, awaiting his response.After a moment, Su Zimo chuckled and replied nonchalantly, \u201cI\u2019m willing to accept the punishment, but\u2026\u201dLittle fatty and the rest had just felt relieved when their hearts sank once more.Su Zimo changed the topic and cast his gaze at Feng Haoyu, saying in a gradually intense tone, \u201cThis is not the end of today yet. Feng Haoyu, we both know the reason behind this challenge between disciples of both peaks. Since you want to fight, I\u2019ll grant your wish.\u201dFeng Haoyu smirked coldly in disdain.\u201cInitially, I had only planned on taking part in the year end face-off for Weapon Peak. But now, I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201dSu Zimo continued indifferently, \u201cListen up. For the year end face-off, not only would you fail to get top for Weapon Peak, you won\u2019t succeed for Elixir Peak as well.\u201dFeng Haoyu had boasted previously that he wanted to be the top of Weapon, Elixir and Spirit Peak.But Su Zimo\u2019s intent was clear \u2013 he was going to stop Feng Haoyu!Only, the moment Su Zimo\u2019s declaration was said, a series of scoffs broke out from the crowd.Even though refining weapons and elixirs both require spirit fire, both are completely different things. In the cultivation world, there has never been someone who was both a Weapon and Elixir Refinement Master.Furthermore, the amount of time and energy a person had was limited. Spending a portion of it on refining of elixirs or weapons was already the limit, let alone mastering both or even being number one in time.By now, there was only half a year left to the year end face-off.This was definitely not enough time.But of course, it was undeniable that Su Zimo had a Level 3 Spirit Fire. If he were to spend the rest of his next six months on refining elixirs and weapons, he would definitely be quite a threat to Feng Haoyu.\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201dJust as everyone was in deep thoughts, Su Zimo said something which caused a huge uproar!\u201cPeak master has forbidden me from stepping into Spirit Peak so naturally, I can\u2019t take part in the Spirit Peak face-off.

However, everyone knew that the year end face-off would definitely create a huge stir!The eventual victor will be decided six months later.At the same time, a gigantic pair of wings tore through the skies from the depths of the clouds, flying into Ethereal Palace.If any disciples of the sect saw that, they would have recognized the owner of those wings as the Mystical Guardian Beast \u2013 that terrifying crane!The crane\u2019s gigantic body landed into Ethereal Palace but with a spin, it turned into a ravishing middle aged lady, elegant with a head of red hair.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dA cry came from a room as a smaller crane dashed over sadly upon sensing the aura of the redheaded beauty, flapping its wings furiously.That crane was the one who had deterred Su Zimo and the others at the front peak of Ethereal Peak.Shaking her head and smiling, the redheaded beauty looked at the little crane dotingly and asked, \u201cWhy? You\u2019re sad about being locked up?\u201d\u201cCaw\u2026\u201dThe little crane seemed as though it wanted to explain something.Looking at the pondering little crane, the redheaded beauty spoke gently after a while, \u201cChild, I\u2019ve been worrying about your future because I can\u2019t bear to see you being enslaved as someone else\u2019s spirit beast and losing your freedom. But I know that this day would come keeping you by my side since I can\u2019t protect you for the rest of your life.\u201dThe little crane did not know why its mother had suddenly turned so moody. Feeling fearful, it ran beside the redheaded beauty hastily.Smiling, the redheaded beauty continued, \u201cBut, I seem to have found someone rather interesting recently.

I\u2019m old now and you\u2019ve still got a long road ahead.\u201dInstantly, the little crane was dejected.After awhile, as though it could not repress its curiosity, the little crane asked inquiringly.The redheaded beauty chuckled. \u201cYou know that man too.

It\u2019s hard to tell how his future will turn out.\u201d\u201cAnd of course, the most important thing is that you don\u2019t have to make a blood oath to follow him. You\u2019ll still retain your freedom.\u201dThe little crane called out a couple more times, seemingly still disagreeable to the suggestion.The redheaded beauty nodded her head. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s still your decision and I\u2019ll not force you. What I mean is that there\u2019s no harm for you to try getting along with him. If you like him, you can stay by his side. If you don\u2019t, you can just leave.\u201dThe little crane cried softly.\u201cYes, of course I won\u2019t lock you up anymore as well. You can head out and play from now on as long as you don\u2019t get into trouble.\u201dRolling its eyes, the little crane lamented. \u201cHmph, hmph! I hate that man the most! He caused me to be locked up for so long and mummy even wants me to follow him? He\u2019d wish! Now that I\u2019m out, I\u2019ll definitely find a chance to get revenge!\u201dThe redheaded beauty could naturally read the little crane\u2019s mind through its expressions.However, she merely chuckled and did not expose him.\u2026In the skies not far away from Spirit Peak, four peak masters were present and Wen Xuan joined them now that he was done.\u201cWen Xuan, my thanks. I owe you one,\u201d The disheveled old man cupped his fists.There was initially no need for a peak master to appear personally to resolve today\u2019s incident \u2013 the Disciplinary Hall could have settled it.However, worried that something might happen to Su Zimo, the disheveled old man requested for Wen Xuan to settle this personally.Wen Xuan waved it off. \u201cLet\u2019s not stand on courtesy between one another.\u201dPausing for a moment, he continued, \u201cActually, I did not intend to forbid Su Zimo from entering Spirit Peak. It\u2019s just that the lad was so arrogant to speak of such brazen words! In a fit of anger, I made that decision so that he could suffer some setbacks.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m still thankful for you stepping in.\u201dThe disheveled old man said, \u201cQi Refinement Warriors are all around the same, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether he learns anything. As long as he enters Foundation Establishment realm and gets promoted as an inner sect disciple, he can learn all the fighting techniques he wants at that time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that, the challenge between him and Feng Haoyu at the end of the year\u2026\u201d Wen Xuan paused in his words.The disheveled old man shook his head. \u201cAs you\u2019ve said, if he loses, so be it. It\u2019ll be good for him to suffer some setbacks. At least, suffering in the sect is better than losing his life out there in the cultivation world.\u201dArray Peak\u2019s master, Xuan Yi, suddenly said, \u201cActually, Su Zimo is not entirely to blame for today\u2019s incident.\u201d\u201cThat Feng Haoyu is quite a scheming fella,\u201d The brown haired youth, Elixir Peak\u2019s master, remarked wistfully.Wen Xuan frowned in displeasure and shook his head. \u201cFeng Haoyu is merely competitive, but he isn\u2019t bad by nature.\u201dThe brown haired youth shrugged his shoulders. \u201cForget it, take it as though I\u2019ve said nothing.\u201dXuan Yi hurriedly changed the topic as the five of them conversed idly for a while more before going their separate ways.\u2026Su Zimo had just arrived at his cave abode in Weapon Peak when little fatty caught up to him.\u201cBro, hold on,\u201d Little fatty called out.Turning around to see the descending little fatty, Su Zimo chuckled. \u201cThank you for speaking up for me quite a bit today.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing,\u201d Little fatty waved it off casually.As though he had just recalled something, Su Zimo apologized, \u201cBecause of me, you\u2019ve offended quite a number of people today. I\u2019m afraid things in Spirit Peak might be tougher for you in the future.\u201d\u201cHeh! Don\u2019t worry about it, bro! Even though I\u2019m only Level 7 Qi Condensation right now, there\u2019s still six months more to the end of the year. I\u2019ve got hope to reach Perfected Qi Condensation too. By then, there won\u2019t be many people who can match me. If anyone\u2019s unhappy with me, they can meet me in the spirit arena!\u201d Little fatty replied in a relaxed manner.When he was done with that, he sighed. \u201cBro, that final challenge you issued to Feng Haoyu\u2026 was a little rash.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Su Zimo could tell that little fatty was hinting something.Little fatty asked, \u201cBro, do you know of the three major secret skills of Ethereal Sect?\u201d\u201cNopes,\u201d Su Zimo shook his head.Little fatty explained, \u201cThe reason why Ethereal Sect could become one of the five main clans of the Great Zhou Dynasty is because they have the legacy of these three major secret skills. Even if you\u2019re promoted to an inner sect disciple, you can\u2019t get to cultivate those skills. Only legacy disciples amongst the inner sect disciples have the possibility of learning them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They are the prodigies that are highly valued and groomed by the sects. Some sects call them as core disciples.\u201dUnderstanding, Su Zimo asked, \u201cYou mean to say that Feng Haoyu is a legacy disciple?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dLittle fatty replied, \u201cBut, he\u2019s almost certain to be one once he promotes to become an inner sect disciple. That\u2019s because he\u2019s already begun to cultivate one of the three major secret skills, Ethereal Sword. I heard it was because my master went to persuade the sect master personally.\u201dWhen he heard that, Su Zimo\u2019s expression turned grim.The fact that he had the rights to cultivate the three major secret skills before becoming a legacy disciple was enough to tell how much the sect valued him.For the secret skill to be deemed as the support of one of the five main sects, it was definitely nothing to scoff at.But of course, to Su Zimo, the factor that determined the victor wasn\u2019t on Feng Haoyu, but himself.Outside the spirit arena of Spirit Peak, the moment he laid his hands on Sun Tao, he discovered that he had a hidden ailment within his body.If he did not remove this hidden ailment, the fight against Feng Haoyu at the end of the year would not be favorable for him.Little fatty went silent for a moment before chuckling. \u201cBut bro, since you made this choice, I\u2019ll still be on your side. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re forbidden from Spirit Peak. I\u2019ll spar with you from time to time during these six months to raise your fighting power and help you familiarize with duel techniques.\u201cAlright,\u201d Su Zimo nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019ll be a little tight on time. After all, you\u2019ve got to raise your cultivation and learn about refining weapons and elixirs at the same time\u2026 no matter what, we\u2019ll just do what we can and hope for the best!\u201dAfter little fatty left, Su Zimo brought the spirit tiger with him back to the cave abode.Sitting on his stone bed, Su Zimo\u2019s eyes no longer concealed his worries.If this was before he had cultivated the Marrow Cleansing section, Su Zimo was absolutely confident that he would be able to take down Feng Haoyu with just the horrifying might of his physical body and melee strength.But now, there were some logical yet unexpected changes in his body ever since he started cultivating the Marrow Cleansing section.Marrow Cleansing implied the swapping of blood.Even though the new blood was extremely strong, it contained obvious signs of its demonic nature!Back on Spirit Peak, Su Zimo\u2019s killing intent rose upon seeing his spirit tiger get injured. Subconsciously, that activated his blood and veins and he felt his body showing signs of demonic conversion!This was a feeling he had experienced back when he activated the Sanguine Ape Transformation.Heaving a deep breath of air, Su Zimo channeled his blood, causing a tremendous aura to surge forth from his veins into every part of his body.He could clearly feel his body expanding and strengthening!The expansion was even more obvious than his flesh being filled and his tendons tightening!This was a complete transformation!His clothes were torn apart by his body, turning into shreds.Even though he could not see his own appearance, Su Zimo knew that he definitely did not look like the refined scholar he was right now.At the side, the spirit tiger glared uneasily.It wasn\u2019t just because it felt foreign towards Su Zimo\u2019s appearance, the aura Su Zimo was emitting was chilling and horrifying!Lowering his head, Su Zimo caught sight of his left hand\u2019s fingernails growing out, jade white and sharp as blades. Merely making contact with them gave off the sound of metal clashing!With a single thought, those frightening nails retracted.The spirit tiger was entirely stumped.Su Zimo\u2019s palms were no different from its own palms where it could retract and release its claws at any time.Green veins popped up and lined all over Su Zimo\u2019s arms, thick like pythons coiling around in a frightening manner.How could this be the arm of a human?!Using spirit qi, Su Zimo conjured a water mirror.Through the shimmering light, he caught sight of a half human half demon appearance. With bloodshot eyes, it was like a mix of an ape and human.His arm trembled and the water mirror disappeared.His entire body was almost transformed save for his right hand that retained its appearance. Fair and tender with long nails, it looked like any other human\u2019s.Read the next chapter on our vipnovel.comHis right hand had always been somewhat strange.Su Zimo had started realizing it back when it could create a Level 3 Spirit Fire.However, he did not know the exact reason why.Heaving a deep breath of air, Su Zimo\u2019s blood began to calm down as his demonic appearance faded too.This was the consequences of demonic cultivation.The effects were not so obvious in terms of Tendons Transformation, Body Tempering and Bones Strengthening.However, now that he was swapping blood through Marrow Cleansing, Su Zimo was showing signs of truly turning to a demon!This was not what he wanted.No matter what, he was a human and did not wish to become a true demon.He had yet to cultivate the Marrow Cleansing to an initial success yet. But once that was done, or if he had achieved phenomenal success, his blood may undergo endless changes and he may never be able to revert to his current appearance.He could almost imagine the consequences of him failing to control himself earlier on at Spirit Peak and revealing his demonic state.First, he might be killed on the spot.Second, he might be forced into a blood oath to become someone\u2019s spirit beast.If Su Zimo had revealed his demonic appearance, no one would take him as a human.The only way demons could survive in the cultivation world was by becoming the spirit beasts of cultivators.It was either that or he would have to leave the sect and live within mountains and forests from now on, mixing around with true spirit beasts while cutting off all ties with his family and kin.That was something Su Zimo could not do.Yet, he was not willing to give up on demonic cultivation as well.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dHe was lost.Naturally, the greatest challenge to Su Zimo right now was the fight against Feng Haoyu at the end of the year.Right now, he had no way of controlling his blood and if his blood churned while he engaged in melee combat, he was definitely going to reveal his demonic nature!By then, many seniors of the sect in the audience would take him down before Feng Haoyu could.If he wanted to win Feng Haoyu, he could only rely on immortality cultivation methods, making use of fighting techniques between Qi Refinement Warriors.However, he was almost blank in that department since he had never practiced for it.There were still six months till the end of the year face-off.Raising his cultivation, refining elixirs and weapons while mastering sword wielding and fighting techniques between Qi Refinement Warriors\u2026Su Zimo made up his mind to pause on the Marrow Cleansing section.It wasn\u2019t just because he did not have time. More than that, he did not dare to carry on.At least, the only thing he could do was to stop his demonic cultivation before he found a way to stop his hidden ailment.Retrieving the Weapon Tripod from his storage bag, Su Zimo began to work on the step of spirit gathering.He had a hunch that he would be able to figure out the technique to spirit gathering soon. That was the most important step in weapon refinement!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

By now, he was so well-versed that every single step was fluid like water without any delays.Within 15 minutes, the tempering was over.He was at the most crucial step once again \u2013 spirit gathering.Heaving out a breath of air, Su Zimo frowned.He had failed countless times at this step and had destroyed many flying swords.How could he solve this issue?Spirit perception, danger, spirit gathering, failure, flying swords destroyed\u2026All of those terms and countless images flashed through his mind.All of a sudden!His eyes twinkled with a bright light.He had just thought of an idea!Su Zimo\u2019s heart palpitated uncontrollably as his eyes could not conceal his joy of excitement.That idea could eliminate the problem of spirit gathering and in fact, he might even attain a 100% success rate through it!Even Advanced Weapon Refinement Masters who could create superior-grade spirit weapons would not dare to claim a 100% success rate for creating inferior-grade spirit weapons.They would only dare to claim they had a high probability of success.Taking a deep breath of air, Su Zimo suddenly kept away the Weapon Tripod.In theory, spirit gathering should be conducted within the Weapon Tripod.The reason for that was because no one could guarantee the success rate of spirit gathering. If they failed, the flying sword would explode on the spot and the shards would cause huge damage all around.The more spirit patterns gathered, the more destructive the impact of the explosion should the spirit gathering fail. In fact, it might even endanger the Weapon Refinement Master\u2019s life.If it was done inside the Weapon Tripod, the shards of the broken flying sword would merely strike at the walls of the Weapon Tripod and the Weapon Refinement Master would not be injured.Now that Su Zimo had removed the Weapon Tripod, he was exposing himself completely to the potential danger!This was a way too dangerous move.If any seniors of the sect saw this, they would definitely try to stop Su Zimo.However, the gleam in Su Zimo\u2019s eyes was only getting more intense by the moment.He was going to expose himself to as much danger as possible \u2013 that way, his spirit perception would unleash its full potential!Su Zimo manipulated the thick spirit qi in the surroundings and channeled it towards the flying sword.All of a sudden!A sense of danger rang in his mind.Instantly, he stopped his spirit pattern creation. The sword was unchanged and undamaged.Su Zimo heaved out a sigh of relief.If he had continued earlier, the flying sword would have exploded on the spot!His spirit perception had informed him of the danger beforehand \u2013 the cicada senses autumn coming before the wind even starts to blow!Adjusting himself, Su Zimo channeled the spirit qi towards the sword once more.Another warning!Stopping his motions, he continued to adjust without any hurry.For the following period of time, Su Zimo continued to test the waters with spirit gathering, abandoning each time he sensed danger.Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, an hour had passed.Finally.The spirit pattern on the sword was clear but Su Zimo had not sensed any danger.The spirit pattern was being etched in!\u201cBuzz!\u201dWith a slight quiver, the sword gave off a clean, ringing sound that reverberated through the cave abode.Success!A clear spirit pattern could be seen gathering on the sword, shimmering brightly.Even though it was only an inferior-grade spirit weapon, he had created it personally.A never before sense of pride rose in Su Zimo\u2019s heart as he looked at the flying sword hovering not too far away.Weapon Refinement Masters were in danger of exploding flying swords from failed spirit gatherings. However, with his spirit perception, Su Zimo could sense that danger beforehand.That was akin to a premonition of a failed spirit gathering attempt so that he could abandon it and readjust for a new attempt.This method of spirit gathering was something never seen before and it was difficult to replicate as well.It was a spirit gathering method unique only to Su Zimo!At that moment, Su Zimo did not know it yet. However, his act of removing the Weapon Tripod was something that would have a huge impact in the future of weapon refinement where countless Weapon Refinement Masters would attempt to imitate.As the scarlet sword gathered its spirit pattern, the surrounding spirit qi was sufficient for a second pattern.A bold thought crossed Su Zimo\u2019s mind.Since he could have a 100% success rate with this spirit gathering method, he could attempt for two spirit patterns to create a middle-grade flying sword!Composing himself, Su Zimo continued to heat up the flying sword that was gleaming red.Swoosh!The spirit qi surged and gathered towards the sword.\u201cNo!\u201dA warning rang out inside his mind as he stopped it right away.It was another arduous cycle of failing and attempting.In the blink of an eye, four hours had passed and he had not succeeded yet. Each attempt brought forth a warning to him.By now, the spirit qi within Su Zimo was almost spent and he was worn out mentally as well.He could no longer hold on.\u201cSeems like I thought too lightly of weapon refinement,\u201d Su Zimo shook his head.Right after he created the inferior-grade spirit weapon, he had a momentary hallucination that he would be able to craft a supreme-grade spirit weapon of his own before long.Now, he knew that it was way too idealistic of a naive thought.But no matter what, creating an inferior-grade spirit weapon was no longer an issue for Su Zimo!Furthermore, he had even created a spirit gathering method that was unique to himself. If he made good use of it, the day would definitely come where he could create a supreme-grade spirit weapon.Heaving a sigh of relief, Su Zimo dipped the scarlet flying sword into cold water for the final step, quenching.Shing!The moment the flying sword met with the cold water, white steam billowed out as the energy created through the mix of heat and coldness solidified the sword and spirit pattern!Looking at the unusually sharp flying sword shimmering in his palm, Su Zimo let out a grin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he chose to remain in seclusion to practice his self-invented spirit gathering method.As he had expected, he was truly able to achieve a 100% success rate for spirit gathering after removing the Weapon Tripod.The pity was that he could only create a single spirit pattern each time.He had yet to succeed on a second spirit pattern.Initially, Su Zimo thought that the materials used were the cause for it. However, he still could not create any results even after using the Pure Gold Crystal.Puzzled, he decided to stop his efforts on weapon refinement for the time being.His victory at the year end Weapon Peak face-off was assured with a 100% success rate of creating inferior-grade spirit weapons.He had six months left and he still had to raise his cultivation, learn fighting techniques and elixir refinement.Towards refining elixirs, Su Zimo had zero knowledge.However, he had no intention of boasting about his current feats.The fact that he was able to create an inferior-grade spirit weapon after just three months into weapon refinement was something that would shock the world.Furthermore, Su Zimo\u2019s intention was to defeat Feng Haoyu completely during the year end face-off. If news of his feat was spread now, there was a chance that Feng Haoyu could avoid the challenge.This day, Su Zimo headed out of his cave abode and flew towards Elixir Peak on his flying sword.He intended to spend his time on learning the craft of refining elixirs.Because the five peaks weren\u2019t really far apart, it did not take long before Su Zimo arrived on Elixir Peak.Every afternoon, inner sect disciples that were Elixir Refinement Masters would head forth to explain more about the craft of refining elixirs and disciples of all five peaks were welcome to learn.Elixir and Weapon Peak were similar in strength \u2013 both were the two weakest peaks in Ethereal Peak.However, there were slightly more disciples in Elixir Peak than Weapon Peak.The reason was simple \u2013 an Elixir Refinement Master could create elixirs for himself which was a huge booster for raising one\u2019s cultivation.However, Weapon Refinement Masters could only create spirit weapons. Even though they boosted one\u2019s fighting strength, it was of no use to one\u2019s cultivation.There were many cultivators who were talented in weapon refinement but failed to form a core. Because of that, they still died of old age with a lifespan of a hundred years.Most importantly, refinement of elixirs was comparatively simpler than weapons because it did not require the step of spirit gathering.Spirit gathering was something so difficult that through the history of time, there were no Weapon Refinement Masters who would dare proclaim a 100% success rate \u2013 Su Zimo was the only one.Su Zimo\u2019s arrival at Elixir Peak attracted quite a bit of attention.After the events of the spirit arena, there were now extremely few trial disciples of the five peaks who did not recognize him.The feud between him and Feng Haoyu was something everyone knew about.Of course, the disciples of Elixir Peak were unsurprised at Su Zimo\u2019s appearance on Elixir Peak too.Afternoon.An inner sect Elixir Refinement Master standing at the front of Elixir Peak\u2019s square gestured with their hands and the crowd gradually went silent.\u201cFellow sect mates, there\u2019s a few things to know before you start on elixir refinement.\u201dThe inner sect Elixir Refinement Master said slowly, \u201cThere are nine grades of elixirs. Typically, a Grade 1 elixir is suitable for Qi Refinement Warriors. Grade 2, Foundation Establishment Cultivators. Grade 3, Perfected Golden Cores. If a Qi Refinement Warrior were to consume a Grade 3 elixir, not only would it not benefit them at all, they might even die on the spot!\u201dSu Zimo nodded in agreement.The logic behind it was simple \u2013 it was the same as when he had devoured the Scarlet Flame Fruit. If one\u2019s body was unable to endure the overwhelming energy, they would just rupture and die.\u201cAnyone who can create a Grade 1 elixir is an Elementary Elixir Refinement Master. Grade 2, Intermediate Elixir Refinement Master. Grade 3, Advanced Elixir Refinement Master. My name is Bo Xuezhen and I\u2019m an Intermediate Elixir Refinement Master.\u201dThe many disciples below looked at him in awe.\u201cHave you guys heard of the saying that every medicine contains 30% poison?\u201dBo Xuezhen continued, \u201cIt is the same for elixirs in the cultivation world as well. However, the poison now refers to the impurities contained in the elixirs. The less the impurities, the better the quality of the elixir. If an elixir could contain at least 89% impurities, it would truly be a poisoned elixir for cultivators.\u201dThe crowd chuckled.\u201cSenior Brother Bo, how do we differentiate between the qualities of elixirs?\u201d A disciple from Array Peak who had just started on learning about elixirs as well asked.Bo Xuezhen\u2019s gaze paused momentarily on Su Zimo before chuckling. \u201cI see that we have disciples from Weapon Peak around as well. Actually, the difference in quality for elixirs is the same as spirit weapons \u2013 both have obvious patterns. The only difference is that they are called spirit patterns in weapon refinement whereas for elixir refinement, they are called elixir patterns.\u201d\u201cThere are five different tiers of qualities for every grade of elixirs. The lowest quality would show a single line of elixir pattern. Of course, an Elixir Refinement Master would not have to gather the pattern personally. That is merely a representation of the amount of impurities within. An inferior-grade elixir would have a single elixir pattern with an impurity content of 40%\u201d\u201cA middle-grade elixir would contain two elixir patterns at 30% impurity. Following that logic, a superior-grade has three patterns and supreme-grade has four. If one could create an elixir with five patterns, it would be 100% pure and that\u2019s called a perfect elixir.\u201dThe mention of that had Su Zimo\u2019s heart skipping a beat.If it was as Bo Xuezhen had mentioned and the same theory applied to spirit weapons since a supreme-grade spirit weapon had four spirit patterns\u2026Could there be an even stronger perfect spirit weapon with five spirit patterns gathered?In theory, Su Zimo was right \u2013 perfect spirit weapons did exist.The reason why no Weapon Refinement Masters in the sect had mentioned it was because spirit gathering was way too difficult. Notwithstanding five spirit patterns, one could even count with their fingers the number of Weapon Refinement Masters who could create supreme-grade spirit weapons in the whole Great Zhou Dynasty.If one were to say that spirit perception was a sense gained through experience, one would have to require immense luck to gather five spirit patterns and create a perfect spirit weapon.Luck, affinity, status, providence, environment, harmony, situation, mental state\u2026 a perfect blend of a myriad of factors were required for the possibility of creating a perfect spirit weapon.And that was with the prerequisite that the Weapon Refinement Master himself was at the paragon of weapon refinement.Bo Xuezhen\u2019s voice rang out once more, \u201cThere are six steps for elixir refinement as well. The first step is material selection which involves the choosing of spirit herbs and elixir recipes. Every elixir requires a different recipe. Within the sect, you can exchange for recipes using contribution points. Outside, you\u2019ll have to purchase them with spirit stones. Naturally, the rarer the recipe, the more expensive they will cost.\u201dEven Grade 1 elixirs have different types and functions.There\u2019s the Essence Nourishing Elixir which is used for stabilizing one\u2019s foundation and nourishing their essence and there\u2019s also Spirit Regeneration Elixir which is used for recovering spirit qi.Something like the Spirit Gathering Elixir is the most commonly available elixir which can help cultivators gather spirit qi better. Those elixirs are easier to refine at the same time.Of the Grade 1 Elixirs, the Foundation Establishment Elixir is the most difficult to refine requiring the most complex ingredients.As the name implies, the Foundation Establishment Elixir can help Perfected Qi Refinement Warriors with breaking through the barrier to Foundation Establishment.The gap in cultivation between Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment was a huge one. If one had the help of a Foundation Establishment Elixir, things would be much easier.Su Zimo listened intently. Even after Bo Xuezhen left, he sat on the spot for a long time, making sure he remembered everything he had learned thoroughly before standing up.Arriving at the Elixir Chamber, he used his contribution points to exchange for an Elixir Furnace and a recipe for the Spirit Gathering Elixir before returning to his cave abode.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he continued pondering over everything he had learned today and took mental notes of his doubts.Thereafter, he memorized the recipe of the Spirit Gathering Elixir by heart and just like that, an entire day had passed.Night descended.According to his previous plan, Su Zimo should be lying on the stone bed right now, cultivating The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness.However, because he could no longer cultivate the Marrow Cleansing section, Su Zimo could only go to sleep while following the breathing and expiration technique of the first three sections, Body Tempering, Tendons Transformation and Bones Strengthening.Thankfully, he had only just learned the Marrow Cleansing section and it was not a habit for him yet.The second day, he got up bright and early and began on his Qi Condensation. Retrieving a spirit stone from his storage bag, he gripped it in his palm and started to raise his cultivation.After Level 5 Qi Condensation, Su Zimo could sense a clear decline in his cultivation speed.If he were to merely absorb spirit qi making use of the spirit stone, he would most likely only reach Level 8 Qi Condensation at best by the end of the year.After all, he had to spend a huge chunk of his time on elixir refinement as well as fighting techniques too.In the blink of an eye, it was already noon.Su Zimo left his cave abode once more and headed to Elixir Peak on his flying sword.To his surprise, the person explaining things today was Elixir Peak\u2019s master, a brown haired youth!Compared to Bo Xuezhen, the brown haired youth\u2019s knowledge of elixir refinement was way deeper.As he explained, the brown haired youth\u2019s gaze would linger from time to time towards Su Zimo for some reason.After an hour of listening, Su Zimo felt his understanding of elixir refinement deepening with many of his previous doubts clarified.After the talk, just as Su Zimo was about to leave, the brown haired youth called him back, beckoning with his hands.Su Zimo went over hurriedly.\u201cHow was it? Could you understand?\u201d The brown haired youth asked, smiling with a warm attitude.Even though Elixir Peak\u2019s master looked to be a youth, his tone was no different from that of an elderly person \u2013 one could tell that he had reverted to his youthful appearance.\u201cYes, it\u2019s not bad,\u201d Su Zimo nodded his head.\u201cDo you have any doubts?\u201dSu Zimo pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cI heard Senior Brother Bo mention previously that every medicine contains 30% poison. Except for perfect elixirs, every other elixir contains impurities. Would that affect the cultivation of cultivators who consume them?\u201dAn approving look flickered through the brown haired youth\u2019s eyes as he nodded. \u201cThere is a reason why we set 40% impurities as the minimum value for inferior-grade elixirs in the world of elixir refinement. This is a conclusion made by seniors before us through history and experience. Therefore, any elixirs that have a grade, even inferior-grade, are harmless to cultivators.\u201dWith a slight pause, the brown haired youth continued, \u201cHowever, seniors have mentioned the impact on one\u2019s cultivation should they consume too many elixirs such that the impurities become sediment in the body and are unable to be purged. Regarding that, there are many different theories to it in the cultivation world but no one has yet to discover the specific impacts that would be caused.\u201dSu Zimo nodded.The brown haired youth patted Su Zimo on the shoulders. \u201cGo back and practice. Elixir refinement is much easier than weapon refinement and you\u2019ll get better with practice. With a Level 3 Spirit Fire as foundation, you can definitely do it. If you have any doubts in the future, feel free to come look for me at any time.\u201dSuddenly, Su Zimo realized.He might have been the reason why the brown haired youth was conducting the session today!Touched, Su Zimo nodded his head.The brown haired youth passed Su Zimo a storage bag. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of spirit herbs in here. This should suffice your practice needs. Keep it.\u201dHesitating for a moment, Su Zimo took over the storage bag and bowed deeply.\u2026Back to his cave abode.Su Zimo retrieved his Elixir Furnace and prepared himself for his first elixir refinement.Before him, four sets of ingredients were laid out neatly according to their types.Su Zimo had already memorized the recipe as well.The first step of choosing materials was completed.Second step, extraction.As the name implies, this step requires the use of spirit fire to purge away the impurities within the spirit herbs so as to extract its essence.Unlike weapon refinement, the level of spirit fire did not determine the outcome of extraction for elixir refinement.Spirit herbs had a high spirit content and was less rigid, requiring the continuous heating of a strong fire.Most spirit herbs are fragile and the temperature they can endure is different too.If the temperature was too high, the spirit herbs would turn into ashes and one would have to conduct a new extraction.If it was too low, the desired outcome of extraction would not be met.That was the reason why Elixir Refinement Masters had to practice continuously so that they understood the temperature requirements of different spirit herbs.Heaving a deep breath of air, Su Zimo took up a spirit herb and started the extraction process.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dThe moment his flames were ignited, the spirit herb turned into ashes.Watching at the sides, the spirit tiger snickered in a mocking manner.Su Zimo glared at the spirit tiger and regained his composure, taking up another stalk of spirit herb for a new attempt.Failure! Again!Another failure, another attempt\u2026Su Zimo\u2019s gaze was resolute and firm as he attempted repeatedly, adjusting the temperature time and again.Finally, under the heat of the flames, the stalk of spirit herb turned into essence in powder form.Placing the tuft of powder into a corner of the Elixir Furnace, Su Zimo continued with the extraction of another spirit herb.It was another round of failures until he finally managed to place another tuft of powder into the Elixir Furnace, separate from the first tuft.After a full four hours, Su Zimo\u2019s forehead was filled with sweat and his spirit qi was almost exhausted. Finally, he had managed to extract the essence of four stalks of spirit herbs, placing them in four corners of the Elixir Furnace.Heaving a sigh of relief, he sat down in a lotus position and started recovering his spirit qi unhurriedly.After awhile, Su Zimo got up and started with the third step of elixir refinement \u2013 synthesis.This step required the mixing of the powdered essence in a specified ratio and order.It was a relatively simple step since the ratio and order were documented in the recipe.However, a single margin of error would affect the content of the produced elixir and in worst case scenarios, it would be a failed refinement.After synthesis was the fourth step, secondary extraction.This was the most critical extraction.A failure in this step would result in a waste of all previous efforts.The fusion of four difference spirit herb essences would result in a structural change such that high heat could be endured. This was the time where a furious flame was required.This was also where the advantage of having a Level 3 Spirit Fire comes in.Whether or not an elixir could be formed with a grade would depend on the amount of impurities that could be purged with this step.The scarlet Level 3 Spirit Fire heated up the Elixir Furnace repeatedly, turning the powdered essence into liquid form.The nine holes of the Elixir Furnace began to seep with white smoke as a fragrant medicinal smell wafted out.If the level of spirit fire was too low for this step, black smoke might be emitted instead along with a pungent smell.After a moment, the secondary extraction was completed.Fifth step, formation.This was a step that required absolute focus and the slightest bit of distraction could result in a failure of elixir formation!Su Zimo took in a deep breath of air and composed himself before dividing the essence within the Elixir Furnace into nine portions. Fusing together, they gradually took shape and solidified towards a pill form.Right then, something weird happened!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instantly, both doors dropped to the ground heavily, creating a dust cloud.One must not be disturbed during the process of pill formation. Caught unaware, Su Zimo was totally shocked as he saw the pills that were about to be formed explode on the spot!His efforts had gone to waste!Not only that, because Su Zimo was still stunned, his mouth was slightly agape and he ended up eating a mouthful of dust\u2026He was finally about to bear fruits for the elixir refinement he had spent an entire afternoon on only to see it go up in smoke.Right then, Su Zimo even had thoughts of killing someone. Unable to control his blood in a fit of anger, he transformed to his demonic form.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dAt that moment, a familiar, mocking cry rang out in front of his cave abode.Turning around, he caught sight of a crane standing at the entrance of his cave abode, flapping its wings excitedly and looking gleeful.\u201cFu\u2026\u201dSu Zimo was about to cuss when he realized his mouth was filled with dust and coughed furiously.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dWhen it saw that, the crane was even more amused; if it could laugh, it would have done so long ago.This was the crane that had fought against Su Zimo on the front peak when he was about to join the sect.Su Zimo recognized it right away.Of all times, this stupid bird chose to arrive at this critical juncture. Su Zimo was so pissed off that his curled fists were crackling and his eyes were bloodshot.\u201cRoar!\u201dThe spirit tiger leaped up and roared towards little crane with widened eyes.Glancing at the spirit tiger, little crane\u2019s eyes were filled with disdain.Initially, the spirit tiger was rather wary about making the first move against little crane that was a spirit demon.However, that look of contempt triggered the spirit tiger instantly.\u201cI can\u2019t take that lying down! I\u2019ve got my pride!\u201dWith a feral roar, it rushed up with fire flaring out of its eyes.Bang!The spirit tiger was sent rolling back even faster and more ferocious than it was when it had pounced ahead.The moment it leapt ahead, little crane flapped its wings and knocked it back. Rolling a few times on the ground, the spirit tiger ate a mouthful of dust as well, looking wretched beyond anything else.Flipping up, the spirit tiger spat out its mouthful of dust and hollered, ready to strike once more.\u201cCome back!\u201dSu Zimo called softly.Without any hesitation, the spirit tiger retreated as though it was waiting for Su Zimo\u2019s command from the get go.At the end of the day, the spirit tiger was only a spirit beast and wasn\u2019t a match for that stupid bird.\u201cAlright, since you destroyed a batch of my elixirs today, let\u2019s use that to write off our feud. From now on, don\u2019t come look for me and I won\u2019t offend you too. How\u2019s that sound?\u201dSu Zimo decided to negotiate with the stupid bird since their feud wasn\u2019t deep to begin with.If he did not resolve this issue, he was not going to have a peaceful life in the future as well.Notwithstanding elixir refinement, Su Zimo wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it even if the stupid bird came every once in awhile during his cultivation.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dLittle crane raised its head in disdain.Su Zimo frowned \u2013 the stupid bird did not seem as though it wanted to let things end here.\u201cOn account that your elder is the Mystical Guardian Beast of the sect, I don\u2019t wish to hurt you. You should not continue to bother me,\u201d Su Zimo said slowly with a stern and blackened expression.\u201cCaw, caw! Caw, caw!!!\u201dLittle crane continued to cry out with a taunting look.Without saying anything more, Su Zimo patted his storage bag as a blood red bow appeared in his hands.Arrow, load and strung bow like a full moon!The entire process was fluid like water as though he had practiced it countless times.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dThe sound of an arrow tearing through the air rang out as a black light streaked past little crane, missing it by an inch.The speed of the arrow was so fast that little crane jumped in shock, totally caught unprepared.Su Zimo declared coldly, \u201cThat arrow was just a warning shot. If you continue to bother me, I\u2019ll kill you with my next arrow!\u201dNaturally, there was no way Su Zimo would dare to kill that stupid bird unless he was tired of living \u2013 that was merely a threat.Furthermore, this stupid bird was still in its infancy stage and was merely being playful; it did not deserve death just for that.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dUpon hearing Su Zimo\u2019s declaration, little crane was enraged as it flapped its wings. Glaring at Su Zimo sharply, it wanted to engage him in a bout!In a swift motion, Su Zimo dashed out of the cave abode.This time round, little crane was prepared as it flew into the skies instantly. Circling around the skies, its talons shimmered dangerously looking as though it could swoop at any moment.Su Zimo arched his bow once more.\u201cSwoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!\u201dHe fired three arrows with all his might.Little crane dodged everything in midair with nimble ease.\u201cCaw, caw!\u201dIt cried out loudly, laughing at Su Zimo\u2019s archery skills.Su Zimo was starting to regret things now.Had he known that this would be the case, he would have pierced the stupid bird\u2019s wings with his first arrow while it was unguarded.But now, things were awkward for him.Even if he could use his flying sword, he would never be as agile in midair as a spirit crane with wings.He wouldn\u2019t be able to unleash his fighting prowess completely.Furthermore, Su Zimo did not dare to engage the spirit crane in melee combat right now. If he lost control of his blood and showed signs of his demonic self, the consequences would be dire.However, if he wanted to make use of his flying sword, he was only at Level 6 Qi Condensation. He might not be able to hurt the crane even if it stood still for him.There was no way for him to fight!After standing at the entrance for awhile, Su Zimo realized that there was nothing he could do to the stupid bird and decided to return to his cave abode.The moment he sat down, little crane appeared before the cave abode and started yelping before he could even take a single breath.\u201cThat stupid bird\u2026\u201dIn a fit of anger, Su Zimo rushed out once more.Again, little crane flew away\u2026The moment Su Zimo returned to his cave abode, little crane returned. It refused to enter his cave abode and instead stood at the entrance taunting him while crying from time to time.Suddenly, Su Zimo had a bad feeling.If this stupid bird were to continue with this, notwithstanding elixir refinement and raising of his cultivation, even a good night\u2019s rest would be a pipe dream.True enough.Su Zimo had just fixed the door to his cave abode when little crane broke it once more.Little crane stood outside with Su Zimo remaining inside. The man, crane and a spirit tiger spent their day looking at one another without doing anything\u2026To that, little crane found extreme joy.The man and the tiger suffered immensely.For the next few days, little crane would visit Su Zimo\u2019s cave abode from time to time, crying loudly outside.At times, the man and tiger would catch a breather once little crane left. But, the moment they tried to catch up on sleep, little crane would return\u2026Not only was Su Zimo unable to cultivate or refine elixirs, even sleeping was a tall task for him.It has been a few days since the man and tiger have slept.Both Su Zimo and the spirit tiger had lost quite a bit of weight.The spirit tiger was on the brink of tears.Previously, it was tormented by Su Zimo for some unknown reason in this cave abode, ordered to roar continuously.Now, a stupid bird had appeared out of nowhere to torment them.By now, the spirit tiger was suffering from mental trauma. It was even contemplating if it should leave Su Zimo for the time being so that it could escape to the forest for a good night\u2019s sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Delving Into FormationsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosThis morning, Su Zimo sported two black eye circles, looking worn out and fatigued with bloodshot eyes \u2013 he was in the same state as the spirit tiger.Under the torment of little crane, it was yet another sleepless night for the man and tiger pair.Suddenly, Su Zimo spoke, \u201cThis can\u2019t go on. We\u2019ve got to think of something.\u201dThe spirit tiger was listless and shrugged its head drowsily.Counting on the spirit tiger to suppress little crane was way too unrealistic.It had a normal bloodline and it was a long way before advancing to become a spirit demon.Even if it could turn into a spirit demon, it had no way of flying and would only be led by the nose by little crane.Su Zimo\u2019s current methods were not enough to suppress little crane as well.Neither the man nor crane could injure the other but Su Zimo could not afford this waste of time.He had considered asking seniors of the sect for help as well. However, given the crane\u2019s status, it wasn\u2019t a guarantee that he would receive any help.Furthermore, Su Zimo had his ego as well.Was he going to be defeated by a stupid bird?After a long silence, he looked at the nearby spirit tiger and said sternly, \u201cI\u2019ll go out for awhile. Don\u2019t follow me. As long as I\u2019m not here, the stupid bird won\u2019t bother you.\u201dThe moment the spirit tiger heard that, it was invigorated and so touched that tears nearly streamed down its cheeks.If Su Zimo had not left, the spirit tiger was prepared to head out to tide through this predicament as well.Patting the spirit tiger on the head, Su Zimo left the cave abode and summoned his flying sword, speeding towards Array Peak.After much thought, he concluded that only an array formation could suppress the stupid bird.If he could set up a large array formation in front of his cave abode similar to the fog that was protecting the sect, he would be able to get rid of the stupid bird once and for all.Su Zimo had zero knowledge about formations and he had to learn from scratch.However, it was better than wasting his time in the cave abode accomplishing nothing at all.Before long, he arrived at Array Peak.It was early morning at that time and there weren\u2019t many disciples on Array Peak; most of them were cultivating in their cave abodes.The Array Peak square would only be filled with more trial disciples come afternoon when it was time for inner sect Array Formation Masters to share their experience.Similar to talismans and elixirs, formations are divided into nine grades.Elementary Array Formation Masters are able to lay out and dispel most Grade 1 formations.Grade 2 formations, Intermediate Array Formation Masters.Grade 3 formations, Advanced Array Formation Masters.There were many types of formations but generally, they could be divided into four types \u2013 killing, trapping, illusionary and buffing formations.The Eight Distresses Formation was a type of illusionary formation whereas the fog formation protecting the sect was a combination of a trap on top of an illusionary formation.In layman terms, the principle behind forming a formation was to make use of different obscure formation patterns while gathering spirit qi to activate various effects.Unlike the other four peaks, Array Peak had a symbolic structure.On the west of Array Peak was their spirit arena and beside it stood the Ten Formations Pagoda.There were 10 floors to the pagoda containing a different formation on every level. Each time a cultivator entered, they would fall into a formation and they could only ascend to the 2nd floor if they managed to dispel it.Following that logic, only cultivators who pass through the first five formations were qualified to be called Elementary Array Formation Masters.Su Zimo\u2019s arrival did not cause much of a stir. However, many Array Peak disciples were surprised.There were only six months left to the year end face-off. Everyone knew that Su Zimo had to work on elixir and weapon refinement alongside preparing for a duel against Feng Haoyu \u2013 there was no time at all.Most disciples present at Array Peak thought that Su Zimo\u2019s appearance to listen in on formations was because the latter had chosen to give up on his duel against Feng Haoyu and scoffed it off.However, none of them knew that Su Zimo was here because he had no choice.He naturally hoped that he could spend all his effort on refinement of elixirs, raising his cultivation and working on fighting techniques. However, the appearance of that stupid bird had ruined all his plans.From that day on, Su Zimo stayed in Array Peak temporarily.Of course, there was no way Array Peak would provide Su Zimo with a cave abode. He spent his days in the Array Chamber, rarely appearing and delving into books to learn of the various formations.Starting with the most elementary formations, he learned and dug further, exploring and researching.There was naturally no way little crane would let Su Zimo off.However, it was embarrassed to create a ruckus inside Array Chamber where Su Zimo was hiding. Instead, it merely gloated internally. \u201cHmph, you can\u2019t hide in there forever!\u201dSu Zimo spent the next period of time on Array Peak.Not only had he memorized all the Grade 1 formations in Array Chamber, he was now researching on Grade 2 formations.As little crane was a spirit demon level beast, Su Zimo had to rely on the power of Grade 2 formations to suppress it.Grade 1 formations could kill, trap or bewitch spirit beasts.However, spirit demons were way stronger and could break through Grade 1 formations with sheer brute force!Su Zimo spent less than a month to memorize and comprehend Grade 1 formations.The reason why he progressed so quickly was because he was putting all of his effort and time into formations.In the cultivation world, there weren\u2019t many people who would be this extreme.However, Su Zimo was forced to a corner by little crane and could only use every single moment he had on learning about formations.Compared to Grade 1 formations, Grade 2 were much more complex.Su Zimo spent more than two months before he memorized and understood most of the Grade 2 formations.Three months. He had spent a whole three months in Array Peak.It was undeniable that Su Zimo was a smart person with a talented endowment. That was something that Die Yue had discovered when he first cultivated The Mystic Classic of the Twelve Demon Kings of the Great Wilderness.Coupled with the pressure from little crane, Su Zimo\u2019s wholehearted efforts into learning about formations were rewarded handsomely.There were two floors in the Array Chamber and the 2nd floor was filled with Grade 2 formation manuals with almost nobody around.Because Su Zimo had spent his later two months on the 2nd floor of Array Chamber, most Array Peak disciples thought that he had left long ago and gradually forgot about him.This morning, Su Zimo came forth from the Array Chamber.The sun was a little piercing to his eyes after such a long time.Standing in front of the Array Chamber, Su Zimo recalled everything he had learnt for the past three months before heading towards the Ten Formations Pagoda.No matter how much he understood and knew about formations, he had to give it a test.The Ten Formations Pagoda was the perfect test to determine where Su Zimo was after three months of formation studies.On the pagoda\u2019s left was Array Peak\u2019s spirit arena. On its right, a tall stele etched with dense lines of words was erected.The upper portion displayed names, the middle portion displayed the number of floors cleared and the final portion displayed the time taken.Su Zimo glanced at it casually.Because it was in the morning, there were no other trial disciples near the Ten Formations Pagoda. There was only an elderly person who was sitting upright with a stoic expression on his face, looking hale and hearty with vigor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
