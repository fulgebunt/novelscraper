This is the lost youth, haha.Writing a book is really a joy and inertia of life now. If you don't code words every day, the whole person is indeed a little empty, but one code word is so tired and panic.So it's really impossible for the update now to be compared with when I was young. At that time, I dared to change ten times, but now I can't make it out.However, the king of all phases really made me find some of the young and second-year feelings when I wrote Dou Po. This book is more comfortable to write.As for the writing style of the King of All Phases, everyone should be able to feel that some changes have been made, but it also has a style that I am familiar with. I think this is pretty good. I don't know how you feel?But no matter what, the King of All Phases will maintain this style. As I said before, I hope that the King of All Phases can be relaxed and humorous, instead of having to look a little heavy or heavy as in the previous book. Because the protagonist is carrying too many things.The style of the new book, I call it fantasy fantasy, in fact it is Eastern fantasy, and all elements of Western fantasy are mixed a little. After all, the pure Eastern fantasy is a bit tiring to write.That's basically it. Finally, thank you again.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unfazed, he mustered the most genial smile he could as he casually swaggered over and engaged Si Qing in conversation. \"House Lord Si Qing, you look more and more energetic as time goes by!\"Looking at Li Luo taking the initiative to walk over, Si Qing similarly beamed at him. \"Li Luo, you're truly the outstanding one. Merely at the One Star Hall but already in the Fiend Palace Tier. I think House Luolan will have another Duke in a few years' time.\"\"No, no, no, you're being too kind. If Sister Qing'e and I can reach the Duke Stage in three years' time and if my parents return, House Luolan will have four Dukes! Wait\u2026\" Li Luo paused for a moment and pointed towards Mentor Chi Chan. \"Silly me, I forgot! We have Mentor Chi Chan over there as well. She recently joined House Luolan. Oh yeah, I almost forgot about Uncle Biao. He might be a little injured, but his situation is improving! If he recovers in three years\u2026\"Li Luo started to count with his fingers. One, two\u2026 before finally waving six fingers before Si Qing as he seriously said, \"It looks like House Luolan will have six Dukes then!\"When faced with this sight, even Si Qing's enthusiasm was dampened.Six Dukes?That was a monstrous fighting force.Although he knew that Li Luo's intention was to frighten him, Si Qing naturally felt flustered deep down for a moment. But he gradually calmed himself down. Although Jiang Qing'e had the possibility of reaching the Duke Stage in three years' time, could Li Luo really achieve the same feat? Whether Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan would return was still up in the air as well. Meanwhile, if Ox Biaobiao truly could recover from his injuries so easily, he would not have sequestered himself away from sight within House Luolan's headquarters for all these years.Thus, logically thinking through the facts allowed Si Qing to recover his composure, and he replied in a measured tone, \"Then I do hope that your hopes come true, Nephew Li Luo!\"If the Regent were to gain the throne today, would he allow House Luolan, a house he held great enmity towards, to survive till Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan returned? Unlikely.Li Luo smiled and nodded. He no longer continued to provoke Si Qing, only glancing at Si Tianming and Si Qiuying, who had complicated expressions on their faces. Si Qing then smiled and nodded before heading to his seat.Jiang Qing'e, on the other hand, stood aside, her indifferent gaze never even so much as looking in their direction. Clearly, she now treated them as enemies. Her personality was different from Li Luo's. Li Luo would still attempt to put in some effort to maintain a friendly facade, but for her, the next time she greeted them might very well be the last.This caused Si Tianming and Si Qiuying to look even more despondent.Some actions were irrevocable, forever irreconcilable.The two were ultimately members of House Jinque, and Si Qing was their father. There was no way for them to separate themselves from this relationship of blood. Thus, Jiang Qing'e and Li Luo would gradually drift apart from them. In the future, they might very well find themselves on opposite ends of the battlefield.After walking past the trio from House Jinque, Li Luo finally found House Luolan's assigned seats.He plonked down upon the cushioned white jade seats and then continued to gaze around curiously. On a row of seats to the rightmost, he noticed Yu Hongxi, Lu Qing'er, and a group of senior officials from the Golden Dragon Bank. The ceremony today had far reaching influence, so even a neutral faction would participate.As he was in the midst of his thoughts, he suddenly heard Mentor Chi Chan lightly informing him of something. \"Vice Principal Su Xin is here.\"Li Luo hurriedly turned his head and saw a large group of individuals entering the square. At the head of the group was none other than the vice principal. It seemed the Astral Sage College was attending this as well.The Astral Sage College had dispatched countles Violet Vibrance mentors, and it was an impressive delegation to behold. All of the numerous heads of the different factions who were nearby similarly stood up and greeted Vice Principal Su Xin, the latter returning them a refreshing smile.However, when Vice Principal Su Xin arrived at Li Luo's position, her smile receded slightly as she coolly studied him and Chi Chan. \"Li Luo, don't you think you have established a few too many records in my college?\"It was evident that she was referring to how he had managed to convince Chi Chan to join House Luolan.Li Luo, on the other hand, put on an expression of sincerity. \"Vice Principal Su Xin, you are too polite. As a member of the college, breaking records is my greatest honor and responsibility!\"This was met with a cold snort. \"Don't you dare overdo things. Although you are a promising sprout, the Astral Sage College can do without you. The college has not concluded on how to deal with Chi Chan's situation. If there are any investigations, I hope that you will cooperate fully.\"\"Of course I will!\" Li Luo nodded enthusiastically.The surrounding factions had taken notice of their little exchange. Mentor Chi Chan had resigned from the Astral Sage College at a critical moment and even had the audacity to tie up House Lanling. This was news that had spread widely, especially since she had opted to join House Luolan after that. This completely startled everyone who knew as it seemed to cast a shadow over the Astral Sage College's perceived neutrality. If they were subtly supporting House Luolan, wouldn't it naturally bring many questions?But Vice Principal Su Xin's accusatory tone seemed to indicate that the situation was not what it seemed.Whether this calling of accounts was real or not, on the surface it seemed as though the college disapproved of the actions taken.After admonishing Li Luo, Su Xin expressionlessly walked away, while the remaining Violet Vibrance mentors looked at Li Luo and Chi Chan with peculiar eyes. This situation had become the hottest topic in the college over the past few days, and there were even rumors that Chi Chan had special feelings towards Li Luo. Still, this rumor was so unbelievable that every logical individual scoffed upon hearing it, but it was still spicy news that people lapped up.\"The mentors looked at me a little strangely\u2026\" Li Luo lamented as the Astral Sage College contingent moved away.\"The Vice Principal is merely putting up an act. You don't need to worry about her targeting you.\" Mentor Chi Chan laughed.\"That I know. She's already done so much to help me. Even if she wanted to beat me up, I would willingly accept it!\" Li Luo said stoically.\"Still\u2026 you two were also involved in this as much as I was. Why did she choose me to be the scapegoat and give me such an earful?! It's so unfair!\" he continued to grumble. His words did not go unnoticed, and the other two rolled their eyes. This brat had already received so many advantages, yet he still pretended to be dumb? Truly hateful and deserving of a good wallop!As they continued to speak, a slight commotion broke out atop the platform itself as horns blared. One could see two rows of individuals make their way out from the corridor.One row was led by the Regent, Gong Yuan, while the other was led by the First Princess, Gong Luanyu.The two rows seemed to be walking closely together, but a sharper eye could discern that they were as immiscible as water and oil, on guard against each other.With their appearance, everyone's gazes were focused upon them.The Regent and the First Princess were the main characters of today's play.Although it was the Little Emperor's coronation ceremony, he was still young and immature. His power would undoubtedly be controlled by the First Princess as she represented his interests.Despite the dark undercurrents swirling beneath the surface, the Regent and the First Princess continued to banter happily, no different from an uncle meeting his favored niece.Under the watchful eye of the audience, the Regent and the First Princess finally ascended to the highest platform where there were three golden, stone seats. The two then took their positions on the left and rightmost seats.Atop the white jade square, a grand and majestic prelude took place before the event officially began. Countless loud drums boomed into the sky, reverberating throughout the royal palace.Anyone who heard the thunderous booms of the celebratory drums would instinctively be reminded of the heroic vigor of cavalry and battle-hardened soldiers.Everyone continued to observe the situation atop the platform cautiously, paying attention to every single minute movement. They were awaiting the official beginning of the coronation ceremony.Time crawled past as the lengthy prelude slowly passed by.Until the sun reached the zenith.The drumming had reached a peak, deafening booms ringing throughout the square. Everyone's hearts seemed to skip a beat for an instant before they regained their composure. They were now focusing on a specific corner of the white jade square, where a massive, golden dragon chariot carried by hundreds of people slowly made its way, completely surrounded by the guard of honor.The frail Little Emperor could be seen atop the golden chariot.His tense expression seemed to give off an air of solemnity.This was it. Everyone knew that the coronation ceremony that would change the fate of the Xia Kingdom had finally started.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tianshu Province.The June sun was blazing, scorching the city of Southwind with its heat.Many youthful faces could be seen within a bright, spacious training area of the Southwind Academy. The young boys and girls were all dressed in training gear and were seated in the lotus position. They were arranged in a circle, and their gazes were directed towards the center, where two figures were engaged in a rapid-fire duel. Clear ringing sounds could be heard echoing throughout the training area each time their wooden swords clashed.Both of the duelists were young, roughly fifteen or sixteen years of age. The youth to the right was quite slender and handsome, with a pair of lively eyes and an elegant demeanor. His spectacular leather clothes alone drew the rapt, bashful gazes of quite a few of the maidens present.\u201cGo, Li Luo!\u201d A particularly brave maiden let out a cheer of support.Li Luo's opponent was another youth, but a much more muscular one. His face looked significantly more brutish, and his skin was swarthy and dark. The duel between him and Li Luo almost looked like a battle between a man and a black bear.When he heard the maiden cheer for Li Luo, he grimaced in a rather jealous manner, then roared out, \u201cLi Luo, I'm not going to hold back any longer!\u201d He took a step forward, causing the floorboard to tremble, then chopped out with his wooden sword towards Li Luo. The sword seemed to screech as it sliced through the air.Li Luo's gaze flickered as he saw the shadow of the sword reaching towards him. He suddenly leapt forwards, moving as agilely as a swallow as he sidestepped this fierce, ponderous strike.\u201cThe Windsparrow Step!\u201d someone cried out with a hint of praise. The Windsparrow Step was just a basic resonance art which quite a few of the people present knew, but not many were able to execute it with Li Luo's level of skill.Li Luo shot towards the muscular youth like a flying sparrow, then suddenly struck out in a move akin to drawing the sword. A ray of light seemed to flash with incredible speed as his sword pierced towards his opponent's chest.\u201cThe Lesser Nimblelight Sword!\u201d another called out in surprise. Li Luo's strike had flashed forward like the curved horns of an antelope, an attack that was both fast and vicious. The onlookers couldn't help but sigh in praise. The most talented student of the Southwind Academy truly lives up to his reputation!The look on the muscular youth's face changed when he saw Li Luo strike at him. However, he was no pushover himself. At this critical moment, he forcefully stabilized himself and then rapidly leapt several steps backwards.Right at this moment, a faint silvery glow appeared in front of him, seeming to take the form of a blurry silver bear's palm that suddenly grabbed the wooden sword. Accompanying the glow was a faint, deep, bearlike growl that seemed to emanate from somewhere within the muscular youth's body.One of the many watching students let out a surprised cry. \u201cThat's Zhao Kuo's fifth-grade Silver Bear Resonance. It seems he's really taking this seriously!\u201dAccompanied by many amazed cries, Zhao Kuo took a step forwards, causing cracks to appear in the floorboards beneath him as he delivered a chopping blow towards Li Luo. His heavy wooden sword was filled with an aura of dominating power and accompanied by an ear-piercing gust of wind, and a rapid silver glow was quickly coalescing atop the sword as well.\u201cBrutal Chop!\u201d the muscular youth roared out, delivering a brilliant blow directly against the incoming piercing sword-shadow.Boom! The two swords slammed into each other with such tremendous force that Li Luo's wooden sword started to crumble into pieces. In the end, the entire wooden sword was blown apart by the forceful, dominating, grizzly-like strike. Faced with this tremendous power, Li Luo was knocked dozens of steps backwards.After stabilizing himself, Li Luo lowered his head to glance at the remnants of his wooden sword, then let out a helpless chuckle. \u201cFine, Zhao Kuo. You win.\u201d\u201cAww.\u201d This regretful sound simultaneously came from the mouths of multiple maidens as they heard his pronouncement. However, many of the young men watching let out little sniggers of joy. As lusty young men in the prime of their health, they naturally felt quite a bit of jealousy towards Li Luo, due to the amount of affection the young maidens present bore him.\u201cWhat a pity! Li Luo's attack was clearly deadlier. He's considerably superior to Zhao Kuo when it comes to applying resonance arts. If it wasn't for the fact that he has yet to awaken a resonance, he definitely would've won this duel,\u201d an onlooker evaluated.\u201cAgreed. Zhao Kuo has a fifth-grade Silver Bear Resonance that grants him astonishing power. In addition, I suspect his resonant power has reached the fifth seal as well. He lives up to his reputation as the strongest member of the Second School.\u201d\u201cLi Luo is definitely incredibly talented in learning and using resonance arts, but he was born without a resonance of his own. This is an incurable weakness. No matter how skilled you are in applying and using a resonance art, your attacks won't be of much use if you don't have sufficiently powerful base of resonant power supporting it.\u201d\u201cHah! No need for you to pity him. Think about who Li Luo is! He's the young lord of House Luolan, one of the four great houses of the Xia Kingdom. His parents, in turn, were the youngest Dukes in the kingdom. In ten short years, their newly established House Luolan quickly ascended to become one of the four great houses. Not only are they famous in the Xia Kingdom, they've even earned a reputation beyond our borders!\u201d\u201cUgh, all that is ancient history. Three years ago, his parents went missing during the Noble's War, and ever since then House Luolan has grown much weaker. And, from what I've heard, there's currently a lot of dissent within House Luolan itself. In the future, it might even break apart. I doubt he'll be the young lord for much longer.\u201d\u201cOh? Is that really true? The current leader of House Luolan is Jiang Qing'e, right? One of our senior classmates.\u201dWhen this name came out, ardent looks appeared in the eyes of all the young men present. This was because the name Jiang Qing'e had reached mythical status in the annals of the Southwind Academy. Still \u2013 when they remembered the special relationship she had with Li Luo, the ardent looks transformed into gazes aimed at Li Luo that were rather odd.As the young men and women present all whispered and gossiped with each other, Zhao Kuo walked towards Li Luo, then patted him on the shoulder. Smiling, he said, \u201cYou alright? Don't blame me for seizing an unfair advantage.\u201dLi Luo chuckled. Zhao Kuo was the straightforward sort, and the two of them were usually on quite good terms. The man hadn't broken any rules either. The fact that he was born with a blank resonance was his greatest weakness; he couldn't blame Zhao Kuo for that.A middle-aged man had been watching the two of them from the sidelines for quite some time. Finally, he turned his gaze away. This man's name was Xu Shanyue, and he was the teacher of the Second School.Xu Shanyue's eyes were also filled with a lot of regret. Li Luo truly was an incredibly talented figure, and he was able to learn any resonance art faster than an average person. In this, he had clearly taken after his two incredible parents, and in fact he actually surpassed them. Unfortunately, the fact that he was born with a blank resonance would prove quite problematic for him when it came to improving his resonant power.When humans trained, they had to rely upon their own resonance and use it as their foundations. They would use their resonances to draw upon the natural energy of the world, then convert it into the force known as power.There were countless different types of resonances, but most could be roughly divided into one of two camps; elemental resonances and beast resonances.Elemental resonances referred to the various elements that filled heaven and earth, such as water, fire, wind, or thunder. As for the beast resonances? According to the legends, during the earliest dawn of human civilization, there was an almighty figure that attempted to strengthen humanity by extracting the spirits of countless beasts, then infusing these spirits into the various human bloodlines, giving birth to what was now called 'beast resonances'. In general, both elemental resonances and beast resonances could be roughly divided into nine different grades.Normally, when a human child reached his teens, a cavity known as the 'resonant palace' would appear within that child's body. Once it manifested, it would naturally give birth to that child's resonance.Zhao Kuo, for example, had awakened a fifth-grade Silver Bear Resonance within his resonant palace. This obviously was one of the many beast resonances. This resonance specialized in granting tremendous strength, and when combined with his own formidable resonant power, it was capable of unleashing truly destructive levels of power.And this was where Li Luo's problem lay. Even though his resonant palace had appeared, no resonance had manifested within the palace. It was completely empty. Cases like this were incredibly rare, and were generally referred to as having a 'blank resonance'. Since he had no resonance to serve as a foundation for drawing and refining energy from the natural world, it was very difficult for him to gain a high level of resonant power. This was the fundamental reason why he had just been defeated by Zhao Kuo.He had no resonance within his palace!The Academy had already performed many different tests to understand why this was the case. His parents were both outstanding figures, after all, and the high-level members of the Academy had very high hopes for him. The had initially believed that in the future, he would definitely be able to gain entrance into the best high-level academy of the Xia Kingdom, the Astral Sage College.When Li Luo had first entered the Southwind Academy, he had lived up to their expectations, demonstrating an absolutely astonishing aptitude for training in resonance arts. He had been immediately granted entrance into its First School, where all the most talented students of the entire Tianshu Province were gathered.Alas, as time advanced and as all the students began to manifest their resonances, his current problem had reared its ugly head. By now, he was the only one with a resonant palace but nothing inside it. As a result, although he was always faster to learn new arts than the other students, his resonant power grew at a much slower rate. By now, his resonant power had actually fallen to be below the average for the First Academy.The whole point of learning resonance arts was to be able to apply your resonant power to greater effect, but if your resonant power was weak to begin with? Well, there was a limit to what even the most profound of resonant arts could achieve.After subjecting Li Luo to a battery of tests, the administrators had come to the conclusion that Li Luo's body simply, innately, lacked any resonance at all. In the future, it would be incredibly difficult for him to advance in his cultivation. After they reached this conclusion, the resonance instructure of the First School immediately requested that Li Luo be removed from the First School and sent to the Second School.To be fair, this made sense. The First School was the place where all the most talented students were gathered, and the teacher simply didn't want Li Luo to hold the others back. But of course, the other, more important reason was that right at that time, both of Li Luo's parents had vanished. With them gone, House Luolan had quickly become the weakest of the four great Houses. Their position was now quite awkward.And so, in the end, Li Luo had been sent to the Second School.Xu Shanyue sighed to himself. When Li Luo had first arrived at the Second School, Zhao Kuo wasn't even a match for him. Now, a mere semester later, Zhao Kuo was able to overwhelm him. If this continued, his ranking within the Second School would most likely continue to drop over the course of the next semester. Unless he was able to dramatically improve his performance, it was likely that he would stand no chance at all of being granted entry into the Astral Sage College.The more Xu Shanyue looked at Li Luo's calm, handsome features and his suave demeanor, the more pity he felt. He knew that the youth was incredibly hard-working, but his parents were simply so spectacular that everyone had incredible expectations for him. As a result, their prestige had become a source of tremendous pressure.Everyone knew the saying that talented parents often had useless children, but few would delve deeper into the reasons behind this.Li Luo cast a glance at the many pitying gazes aimed at him, swept the splinters off his clothes, then sat down cross-legged. He knew exactly what all of them were thinking, of course.A blank resonance, eh? This pretty much guaranteed that his future prospects were dim. But\u2026 Li Luo smirked slightly. He couldn't help but unconsciously reach down to touch his lower abdomen.He had a secret which no one else knew. In his resonant palace, there was more than just a so-called 'blank resonance'.For cultivators of this world, at first their bodies would give birth to a single resonant palace; only later, when they reached the Duke stage, would they gain a second resonant palace. Finally, upon reaching the King stage, they would gain a third. However, the number of Dukes in the Xia Kingdom could be counted on one hand, while Kings were virtually unheard of despite how powerful the Xia Kingdom was.But of course, there were no absolutes. Supposedly, there were some especially blessed individuals who had a chance of gaining a second resonant palace even before they reached the Duke stage. This happened naturally as their resonant power advanced, but the chances were incredibly low.And this was what made Li Luo special. \u00a0Although he was still at the earliest Ten Seals stage, he didn't have just one resonant palace in his body \u2013 he had three, which was completely unheard of!Normally, only supreme experts who had reached the King stage would have three resonant palaces, but somehow this had manifested within his body. But what was even more shocking\u2026 was that all three palaces were blank!Having a blank resonance meant your future prospects were dim. \u00a0But three blank resonances \u2013 did that mean you had a future, or not? Li Luo let out a sigh, a rather depressed look on his face.Just as Li Luo was feeling all these mixed emotions, Zhao Kuo came over and sat down next to him. Zhao Kuo whispered, \u201cYou still haven't resolved your resonance problem, eh?\u201dLi Luo silently shook his head. Upon seeing this, Zhao Kuo let out a helpless sigh as well. Actually, he knew that this was a dumb question. A person was born with a resonance; it was innate, and no one had ever heard of someone later filling in a blank palace with something else. Clearly, Li Luo was facing a serious problem.As the two chatted, Xu Shanyue walked into the dueling grounds. After giving Li Luo a few words of encouragement, he turned and said to the many students present, \u201cEveryone, important exams will be starting next month. Your chances at entering a college will be dependent on your performance in the exams. I urge you all to train hard.\u201dThe students were all silent, and they all had solemn looks on their faces. All their years of hard work were focused towards the exams coming up next month. If they were able to get into a college, then their future prospects would improve dramatically.After this, Xu Shanyue announced that class was over. Li Luo and Zhao Kuo walked side-by-side as they left alongside the other students.\u201cI'm going to spend some more time training my resonance arts. Honestly, you gave me a good scare today. I suspect that if your resonant power was just slightly higher, you'd beat the pants off of me,\u201d Zhao Kuo said with a sigh after exiting the training grounds. He then waved goodbye towards Li Luo.Li Luo smiled as he watched Zhao Kuo depart. He knew the truth; Zhao Kuo was afraid that Li Luo was in poor spirits after this defeat, and so wanted to give him some alone time. What Zhao Kuo didn't understand was that by now, Li Luo had grown accustomed to it all.Li Luo withdrew his gaze, then turned and followed a tree-lined road that led outside the Academy. He ran into quite a few students as he walked, and all of them, both male and female, would glance at him as they passed. It wasn't just because of his good looks; rather, it was because he was now a rather notorious figure at the Academy.In the face of their gazes, Li Luo maintained a look of practiced indifference. He continued to follow the pathway until he reached the Academy gates, at which point he paused.In front of him was a large number of students who were all speaking in a lively manner. These students were all surrounding a very special bluestone wall \u2013 the Southwind Academy's Wall of Honor. It contained the descriptions of all the mighty figures who had once graduated from the Southwind Academy.By now, all the students had seen the Wall of Honor countless times. Logically speaking, they should've grown weary of examining it long ago, but for some reason they were quite focused on it today.Li Luo pursed his lips. He knew what was going on. The vast majority of the students here were because of 'her'.Li Luo turned his gaze to a very specific point on the Wall of Honor. There was a gleaming crystal at that point, emanating rays of light that slowly coalesced into a tall, willow, and almost lifelike figure.The figure was that of a girl. She was dressed in the school uniform of Southwind Academy \u2013 a light blue cape, a simple white tunic, and a short black dress. She had a pair of long, dainty legs that were perfectly white and pleasing to the eye.Her facial features were similar exquisite. She had an elegant, raised nose, long and thick lashes, and snow-white skin. All of these were quite mesmerizing to behold, but it was her eyes that truly engraved her in everyone's mind.Her pupils were golden, and they emanated an ineffable feeling of purity. If you stared into them long enough, you would begin to feel a sense of pressure.Her gaze was rather cool, and she stared straight ahead, with one hand on her slender hips and the other resting on the hilt of a heavy sword. Any who saw her would instantly feel a sensation of heroic, fierce majesty emanating from her. She truly was a soul-stirring girl, in terms of both appearance and demeanor.The wall behind her projection held her name \u2013 Jiang Qing'e. She was one of the dazzling star graduates of the Southwind Academy, born with a ninth-grade Light Resonance and enough talent to cause the countless people of the Xia Kingdom to sigh in amazement.After spending just two years in the Academy, she had been immediately recruited by the Astral Sage College even though she had yet to take her graduation exams. In the past hundred years, she was the only person in Tianshu Province to receive such an honor. By now, she was a legend of the Southwind Academy, and the many students who had enrolled after her practically worshipped the ground she walked on. In fact, she was now incredibly famous throughout the entirety of the Xia Kingdom.Li Luo stared at the projection of Jiang Qing'e in a daze for a few moments, before noticing that quite a few gazes had turned towards him. Those gazes were filled with a look of resentment, envy, and puzzlement.Li Luo maintained his look of practiced indifference. He knew exactly why they were staring at him like that. It was because Jiang Qing'e, venerated almost like a goddess by both the male and female students of the Southwind Academy, had two other statuses. She had been trained by his parents since she was young\u2026 and she was his betrothed.Or, to put it another way, she was his fianc\u00e9e.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0002\u2013 A Fiancee Who Doesn't Want An AnnulmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs far as Li Luo could recall, the first time he met Jiang Qing'e was when he was three. His parents had just returned from a long journey, and on their return they had brought back the five-year-old Jiang Qing'e. Later on, they had accepted her as their disciple.From a certain perspective, it could be said that the two of them truly were inseparable childhood friends, and his parents had truly doted on her as well.Unfortunately, ever since they were young the relationship between the two was rather complicated. Jiang Qing'e was simply too outstanding, even as a child, and she was also two years older than Li Luo. Whenever they fought as children, the end result was invariably Jiang Qing'e beating the snot out of him in a calm manner until he submitted.Honestly, it was a friggin' nightmare.As for the reason why she became his fianc\u00e9e? Supposedly, when she was roughly ten or so years old, Li Luo's father had commented in a drunken stupor that it would be wonderful if she one day became his daughter-in-law. The very next day, the ten-year-old Jiang Qing'e had personally written up a marriage contract and handed it over to Li Luo's speechless father.That night, Li Luo's old man had almost been beaten senseless by Li Luo's enraged mother. Worse \u2013 Li Luo had been watching and laughing at all of this, and as a result his mother had spanked the crap out of him as well.Li Luo's mother had asked Jiang Qing'e to annul the marriage contract. Unexpectedly, she put on a rare show of absolute stubbornness. Without saying a word, she simply knelt down before Li Luo's mother and father and refused to rise.In the end, Li Luo's mother and father had no choice but to accede to her request. However, after doing so, they secreted away the marriage contract and never raised the topic again, pretending as though it had never existed.As time had passed, nothing further was said on the matter. Everyone, even Li Luo himself, had long since forgotten about it. However, one day when Jiang Qing'e was at the Southwind Academy, she told a particularly determined suitor that she and Li Luo had long ago betrothed to each other.This news had stunned the entire Academy; no, it had shocked the entire Tianshu Province! Thankfully, at that time Li Luo had yet to enter the Southwind Academy; otherwise, if he had, he would've instantly become an absolute pariah.Even now, after the passage of so many years, Li Luo was still somewhat affected by the aftershocks of that announcement. From this, he keenly understood just how charismatic a figure Jiang Qing'e was.\u201cPops, you really screwed me over,\u201d Li Luo silently mumbled to himself.\u201cYo, Li Luo! Why do you pause here every day? Are you enjoying the envious gazes of the crowds?\u201d Just as Li Luo was sighing to himself, a girl's voice suddenly rang out from behind him.Li Luo turned, only to see an attractive young maiden standing behind him. Her hair was waist-long, and although she wasn't quite up to par with Jiang Qing'e, she was definitely a natural beauty. The skin-tight school uniform she wore accentuated her lovely curves quite nicely.At this moment, the young maiden was standing with arms folded across her chest, a rather mocking look on her face. Despite that, a calm look was on Li Luo's face when he saw her. This was Difa Qing, one of his classmates. She was considered a beautiful golden flower of the Southwind Academy, and came from the Difa clan, one of the three great clans of the Tianshu Province.She didn't have anything against Li Luo. However, she was a diehard fan of Jiang Qing'e \u2013 the extremely over-zealous, almost obsessive type of diehard fan. In her eyes, Jiang Qing'e was as beautiful, flawless, and perfect as an Immortal fairy. There was no man in this world who was worthy of her \u2013 and of course, that included Li Luo as well.Even though Difa Qing agreed that Li Luo was an exceedingly handsome fellow, she also felt that looks were superficial. Someone worthy of Jiang Qing'e had to be a dragon amongst men, both internally and externally. Li Luo, however, had only won a marriage contract with her thanks to his parents. In Difa Qing's eyes, this was an absolute blemish on her goddess' honor.And so, ever since Li Luo had joined the Southwind Academy, whenever Difa Qing saw him she would first commence with a barrage of mocking words. After that? A series of endless questions.\u201cLi Luo, when are you going to annul the marriage contract between yourself and elder sister Jiang?\u201dRight on cue. She had repeated this question countless times by now. Even Li Luo couldn't help but rub the bridge of his nose before responding irritably, \u201cNone of your damn business.\u201d He then turned and left.A look of anger instantly appeared on Difa Qing's face. She stubbornly followed behind him. \u201cLi Luo, do you really want to be the proverbial toad that lusts after a swan?\u201dLi Luo, however, simply continued to ignore her completely. This just further enraged her to the point where her veins started to pop out. She sped up her footsteps to chase him down, then continued, \u201cLi Luo, if you refuse to annul the wedding contract, the only one who's gonna be in trouble is you. The more talented elder sister Jiang is, the more trouble you'll be in. Your parents have been missing for years now, and even House Luolan itself is at the verge of collapse. Your status as the young lord of the House isn't going to be able to shield you for much longer.\u201d\u201cYou have no idea how many incredibly talented young men of Xia, all of whom have powerful backgrounds, are all smitten by her.\u201cJust because your parents treated her well, doesn't mean you can force her to repay you like this!\u201cLi Luo, if you refuse to annul the marriage contract with her, even here in the Academy there will be people who will cause you trouble!\u201dFinally, Li Luo came to a halt. \u201cOh? And who might that be?\u201dDifa Qing let out a light snort. \u201cI imagine you know who Bei Kun of the Bei clan is, yes? He's already made it known that he hopes you will not rely on your status to force yourself on elder sister Jiang. He's also requested that you have a small meeting with him at the Clearwind in two days.\u201dLi Luo chuckled. \u201cI'm familiar with him, yes. In the past, he always liked to fawn over me.\u201dWhen his parents were still around, House Luolan's words held almost as much weight as that of the governor of Tianshu Province. Bei Kun had often paid visits to Li Luo and professed his undying friendship. Who would've thought that a few scant years later, House Luolan's situation would've completely changed and this former friend of his would now come and cause him trouble?In the past, Bei Kun's favorite pastime was to put on banquets at the Clearwind hotel, and he often would issue warm invitations to Li Luo. Now, he was proposing a hostile rendezvous? The man was straightforward enough.Difa Qing said, \u201cLi Luo, there's no need for you to mock him. This is how the world is. When your clan is powerful, many will toady up to you. Now that House Luolan has weakened, why should others give you any face? Even in the past, the ones they were giving face to were your parents, not you.\u201dLi Luo nodded in agreement. \u201cI quite agree with what you said.\u201d During the course of the past two years, Li Luo had quickly come to learn just how fickle fortune and friendship could be. Thus, he said nothing else and instead sped up as he departed the Academy.However, Difa Qing followed after him. She was seemingly unwilling to just let this rest, and continued yammering nonstop. Every single thing she said was aimed at one thing \u2013 that Li Luo should be willing to give Jiang Qing'e her freedom.By now, Li Luo knew that the best way to deal with this type of person was to completely ignore her, and so he didn't pay attention to a single word she said. Finally, after passing through a series of hallways, he exited the Academy.As he did so, he suddenly noticed that the ambient noise level seemed to have dropped dramatically. \u00a0Even the mosquito-like buzzing of Difa Qing seemed to have come to a halt, as though she had a frog in her throat.Li Luo turned to glance at her, only to see that her face was bright red. A look of excitement was in her eyes as she stared at the stone stairway outside the Academy.Suspecting what was going on, Li Luo followed her gaze, only to see that a carriage was parked before the stairway. The carriage had an antique, noble design and was quite spacious. It had four pure red wheels, and was pulled by a muscular lionhorse. At the front of the carriage was a very familiar insignia \u2013 the House Luolan insignia.As for the reason why Difa Qing's face was crimson, and all the nearby students had looks of excitement on their faces? It naturally wasn't just because of the House Luolan carriage itself \u2013 rather, it was the young woman standing in front of the carriage.The young woman had her hair in a casual ponytail, and her features were both exquisite while graceful. Her skin shone beneath the rays of the setting sun. She was dressed in a short blue cape, held a thin whip, and wore a short war-skirt. Beneath the war-skirt was a pair of mouth-watering slim white legs\u2026 but most eye-catching of all was her pure, lustrous golden-pupiled eyes that shone like the sun.It was Jiang Qing'e!A series of murmurs began to arise from outside the Academy. Countless students were staring at her slender figure. They never would've imagined that on this day, they would have the chance to see in person this legendary graduate of the Southwind Academy.Li Luo passed through the murmuring, excited crowd as he walked down the steps, then moved next to Jiang Qing'e. Rather surprised, he said, \u201cSister Qing'e, when did you return to Southwind City?\u201d Although House Luolan had arisen in Southwind, after becoming one of the four great Houses of the Xia Kingdom, it had already shifted its headquarters to the capital of the Xia Kingdom, the city of Xia.After Jiang Qing'e had been admitted into the Astral Sage College, the most supreme college of the Xia Kingdom, she too had moved to Xia City. Over the past two years, she had also been consumed with affairs regarding the management of House Luolan, and so it was quite rare for her to return to Southwind. It had been quite some time since even Li Luo had seen her.Jiang Qing'e glanced at him, then said in a calm voice, \u201cTomorrow is your seventeenth birthday. In addition, House Luolan has some important business to be discussed here. I just arrived at Southwind today, so I thought I'd come pick you up and take you home.\u201d Her voice was extremely pleasing to hear \u2013 it was both crisp and calm, like water from a deep mountain spring that was falling upon jade.Li Luo nodded. The attitude that Jiang Qing'e was displaying didn't surprise him in the slightest. He had known her for ages now; this was just how her personality was.\u201cLet's go, then,\u201d he said. Jiang Qing'e was simply too popular here at Southwind Academy. Just by standing here, she had become the focal attention of the entire area. He himself felt as though everyone was staring daggers at him.Jiang Qing'e nodded slightly, but she didn't immediately turn back. Instead, she looked at the excited Difa Qing, who was standing right behind Li Luo. \u201cYour name is Difa Qing, yes?\u201dDifa Qing nodded repeatedly, her face ruddy from excitement. \u201cYou actually still remember me, elder sister Jiang?\u201dJiang Qing'e said quietly, \u201cI hope you won't bother Li Luo any more. Otherwise\u2026 I will probably have to take extremely good care of your elder brother at the Astral Sage College.\u201dThe look of excitement on Difa Qing's face instantly froze. A long moment later, transfixed by Jiang Qing'e's golden gaze, she nervously nodded. She no longer displayed any of the earlier confidence and arrogance that she had shown before Li Luo.After speaking, Jiang Qing'e turned and entered the carriage alongside Li Luo, her blue cape flapping slightly. Moments later, the lionhorse let out a long bellow before it carried them away through the mist.As for Difa Qing, she just stood there and watched the carriage depart. A long while later, she finally rubbed her eyes, an intoxicated look on her face.\u201cElder sister Jiang\u2026 she's SO COOL! \u00a0I absolutely ADOOOORE her!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It pulled the carriage behind it in a stable yet fast manner, causing the forest of buildings to rapidly disappear.The inside of the carriage was quite spacious, and the temperature was quite comfortable. Li Luo and Jiang Qing'e were seated facing each other, with a small tea table between them. The two didn't exchange many words \u2013 Li Luo just sat there calmly with his eyes closed, while Jiang Qing'e had opened up a book and was intently reading it.A ray of sunlight shone into the carriage from a crack in the curtains, falling upon Jiang Qing'e's exquisite jade features and giving her an almost crystalline, translucent complexion.After a long period of silence, Jiang Qing'e blinked her long lashes, lifted up her slender face, then stared intently at Li Luo with her golden eyes. \u201cIt seems the words I spoke at Southwind Academy all those years ago have caused you some trouble. I'm very sorry about that.\u201dLi Luo remained silent, but he opened his eyes. He looked back at her, noting her exquisite features as well as her aura of strength and fierceness, then chuckled. \u201cI don't see any sincerity in this apology. If you are sincere, then let me cancel our engagement.\u201dJiang Qing'e flipped through a few more pages. \u201cIs this the legendary 'annulment request'? But according to the way the script is supposed to play out, I should be the one making this request. Have you perhaps gotten things backwards?\u201dLi Luo was caught off-guard by her sudden display of deadpan humor. For a moment, he didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.Jiang Qing'e raised her head and cast him a glance, then said calmly, \u201cWhat's the problem? Are you afraid that our engagement will cause you even more problems in the future?\u201dLi Luo was silent for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cI'm worried that I would be holding you back. There's no reason for a girl like you to be burdened by an unnecessary engagement. And while we are on this topic \u2013 do you know how many times my old man got his ass kicked by my mom because of this engagement? Now, I personally supported her kicking his ass for him coming up with such a stupid idea, but the real problem was \u2013 each time, after she finished kicking his ass, I would get my ass kicked as well!\u201dA resentful look appeared in Li Luo's eyes as he discussed this. As for Jiang Qing'e, when she thought back to how that normally gentle and refined woman had repeatedly giving drubbings to both Li Luo and his father for her sake, her small red lips couldn't help but quiver in amusement. Afterwards, she calmed back down and shook her head. \u201cI'm not worried.\u201d:Li Luo felt a headache coming. \u201cThen what if you fall for someone else in the future? This is absolutely ridiculous, you know.\u201dJiang Qing'e smiled calmly. \u201cI might not meet such a person. I'm quite picky, you know\u2026 and now that the two of us are engaged, there's no way I'd give my heart to another.\u201dLi Luo stared hard at Jiang Qing'e. Suddenly, a hint of anger entered his voice. \u201cJiang Qing'e, what the hell are you thinking? I know my parents treated you well, and you are very grateful towards them, but there's no need for you to express your gratitude this way. What the hell do you take me for? A tool for you to show gratitude? You might have agreed to this engagement, but I never did!\u201dLi Luo's sudden show of anger startled her. She stared pensively at him with her pure golden eyes for a long, silent moment, then lowered her head slightly. \u201cI apologize. I admit that I didn't take your feelings into consideration.\u201dSeeing this, Li Luo pressed the advantage. \u201cIf that's the case, then we should-\u201d\u201cHowever!\u201d Jiang Qing'e raised her head again, then stared at Li Luo intently. \u201cYou know what the rules of our House are. If two House members are unable to come to an agreement, then the only way to resolve it is through a duel. The winner gets to make the final decision.\u201dThis was a rule which Li Luo's mother had laid down, and it was applicable to any household disagreements whatsoever. Thus \u2013 every time she and Li Luo's father had gotten into an argument, she would roll up her sleeves and then drag the old man into the training grounds to fight it out.\u201cIf you truly are completely unwilling to be engaged to me, then we can go to the family training grounds and then resolve it in accordance with our House rules,\u201d Jiang Qing'e said.Li Luo's face turned comically stiff for a moment, before a variety of expressions flashed through it. Finally, he gritted his teeth, pointed at her, and said furiously, \u201cJiang Qing'e, you go too far! I'm still in the early stages of the Ten Seals. How the hell am I supposed to fight against you, an Earth Fiend?\u201dHuman cultivators, after establishing their resonant palace, were considered to have entered the most rudimentary stage, the Ten Seals stage. After this came the Resonant Master stage, at which point they could be considered to have truly embarked into the path of cultivation.There were three primary levels to the Resonant Master stage \u2013 General, Duke, and King. Putting aside the latter two stages for now, the 'General' level itself also consisted of two sub-levels; the first level was known as the Heavenly Dipper General, while the second sub-level was known as the Earth Fiend General. As for Jiang Qing'e? She was already as the Earth Fiend General level.For someone so young to be able to become an Earth Fiend General was simply stunning. Everyone was truly shocked by Jiang Qing'e and her talent. Some even suspected that she would soon be the one to break the record for being the youngest Duke of the Xia Kingdom.For an Earth Fiend General like her to battle against Li Luo, who was still in the Ten Seals stage\u2026 honestly, Li Luo was rather worried that if she might whack him to death with a palm, just by accident.Jiang Qing'e put away the book, then said in a regretful manner, \u201cIt seems you don't want to accept my proposal. There's nothing else I can do.\u201dLi Luo was so furious, he was shaking. What the hell is wrong with the world? Why is it so hard for me to annul my engagement? He then turned to stare lifelessly out the carriage window. From the corner of his eyes, he could still catch a glimpse of Jiang Qing'e \u2013 specifically, her dazzlingly exquisite features and her intoxicatingly pure golden eyes.Li Luo let out a sigh, then said in a much more subdued voice, \u201cBig sister Qing, we've known each other for years. I know very well that the feelings you have for me are not romantic in nature. What's the point of being engaged when love isn't part of the picture?\u201dJiang Qing'e was silent for a moment. \u201cHonestly, my first reaction is to say \u2013 a seventeen-year-old kid like you shouldn't put on such worldly airs. But, I have to admit that you do speak some sense. However, I have no interest in any other men at all. As for you \u2013 at least I don't find you repulsive.\u201dLi Luo let out a bitter chuckle. \u201cBig sister Qing, the main reason you set up this engagement was to show your gratitude to my parents. I'm sure that your feelings towards them are much stronger than any feelings you might have towards me. But\u2026 I really have no need for this form of 'gratitude'.\u201dLi Luo lowered his head. He said in a slow voice, \u201cI know that it isn't going to be easy to get you to annul this engagement, but\u2026\u201d He raised his head to stare directly into her eyes. \u201cI hope that you will give me, and yourself, a chance.\u201dLi Luo paused a moment, then continued. \u201cLet's do a trade. I'm not strong enough to manage our House, and so in the interim you have taken over on my behalf. One day, however, I will take back control. If on that day, you are able to return to me a House that is more-or-less as strong and prosperous as the one you took over, then as my way of showing gratitude, I will 'grant' you freedom from this engagement. Deal?\u201dJiang Qing'e did not immediately respond. For a long, silent moment, she tapped her long, slender white fingers on the table in a rhythmic manner. Finally, she said in a soft voice, \u201cLi Luo. Do you really dislike me that much?\u201dLi Luo was startled. He took a deep breath, then said, \u201cJiang Qing'e, I think you may have underestimated your attractiveness and your appeal. Your beauty and your charisma is enough to cause anyone of our age to be instantly smitten with you. If I claimed to have no interest in you at all, then I would be lying to both myself as well as to you.\u201d\u201cBut. This is not the type of engagement I want, or need.\u201dJiang Qing'e raised an eyebrow, then suddenly smacked the table with one dainty hand.Crack! The sudden sound jolted Li Luo, causing him to quickly sidle backwards. \u201cHey, let's keep it civilized! No need to resort to violence.\u201dJiang Qing'e rolled her eyes at him, then said calmly, \u201cLi Luo, it's been a while since we've met. Clearly, you've become a bit more eloquent since then. I agree that your words have some merit. Fine. We can treat this as a trade. Once you are ready to assume control over House Luolan, I'll be sure to hand it over in a healthy, intact state. At that time, you can annul our engagement.\u201dLi Luo was speechless, then let out a long sigh. He instantly felt as though he had been relieved of a heavy burden. However \u2013 in the deepest part of his heart, he couldn't help but feel a sense of inexplicable loss. He cursed at himself for feeling this. The hell is wrong with you?\u201cYour little speech today has caused me to look upon you in a new light. It seems you are no longer a little boy.\u201dLi Luo was irritated. \u201cLittle boy? There's nothing little about me.\u201dJiang Qing'e ignored his words. She gaze at him with an enigmatic half-smile, then continued, \u201cBut, Li Luo\u2026 I do have to give you a little reminder. Are you absolutely sure you want to enter this deal with me? Once our engagement is off \u2013 I suspect that you will never, ever have a chance to get it back.\u201dLi Luo narrowed his eyes, then leaned forward with both hands pressed to the desk and stared directly at Jiang Qing'e. Their faces were less than a foot apart. \u201cJiang Qing'e, I really have no interest in this type of 'engagement' \u2013 because in the future, I intend for you to personally hand me an engagement agreement, rather than hand my parents one.\u201dJiang Qing'e stared right back into Li Luo's handsome face with her golden eyes, the amusement on her face growing stronger. She knew exactly what Li Luo meant. The reason why he wanted to annul this marriage agreement was because as of right now, she had no interest in him as a man. If in the future, she once more proposed to be engaged to him, it would only be because she had fallen for him.\u201cSit your butt down.\u201d Her red lips quivered. Suddenly, an invisible force appeared out of nowhere and pressed Li Luo back into seat with enough force to cause him to let out an involuntary squawk.Just like that, all of his posturing had been wiped away.Jiang Qing'e rested a hand on her fragrant cheeks, then cast Li Luo a rather lazy look. \u201cYou don't have a lot of skills, but you sure have a lot of guts. I've encountered many geniuses in recent years, but none of them ever dared to speak to me like this. Li Luo \u2013 don't let your reach exceed your grasp by too much. Your goal is completely unrealistic. But \u2013 if you really want to give it a shot, I'll give you a chance.\u201dHer golden pupils suddenly glowed with a mysterious, inscrutable light. \u201cI'll wait for you at the Astral Sage College. This is your first step. If you can't even accomplish this, then let's both just forget about what you said today. We'll chalk it up as being the words of a rebellious youth.\u201dThis time, Li Luo didn't interrupt. He leaned back against the carriage window as he slowly closed his eyes. He said in a calm voice, \u201cThen just wait for me there.\u201dJiang Qing'e turned her gaze out the window. As she watched their carriage move past the various buildings, a stray ray of sunlight sparkled across her golden eyes. The tiniest of smiles appeared on her face, filled with a rare look of softness.After they had traveled for a long period of time, Li Luo suddenly opened his eyes. Rather puzzled, he said, \u201cThis isn't the way home.\u201dJiang Qing'e gently nodded, then said quietly, \u201cWe're going to pay a visit to the Golden Dragon Bank. There's something we need to pick up there.\u201dShe turned her golden gaze towards Li Luo. \u201cBefore Master and Mistress left, they prepared something for you. They said that you were only to open it up after you reached the age of seventeen.\u201dLi Luo was speechless. His heart shook. Mom, Dad\u2026 you left something behind for me?1. These stages come from the Tales of the Water Margin/Suikoden; there were 108 legendary heroes, who were divided into the 72 'heavenly dippers' and the 36 'earthly fiends'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of which, two were behemoths that held stances of absolute neutrality. These were titans that even officials and the royal family would never dare to aggravate.The first was the renowned Astral Sage College. The second, the Golden Dragon Bank.Attending the Astral Sage College was the aspiration of numerous Xia Kingdom youths. The elites that graduated from there were often courted by the numerous powers of the land.The Golden Dragon Bank, on the other hand, was involved in the trading, safekeeping, and auctioning of all sorts of goods and treasures. Their financial might was so immense that any power would stare at their wealth with reddened eyes. Yet no one dared to even dream of infringing on their interests! The true might of the Golden Dragon Bank far superseded any power in the Xia Kingdom. The branch that existed in the Xia Kingdom was just that, a mere branch!The main branch of the Golden Dragon Bank was located in a place far more vast than the Xia Kingdom, and they had a resounding reputation across the land. This was because the golden dragon notes issued by the bank could be redeemed for an equivalent amount of skygold at any branch.\u2026\u2026...The City of Southwind was the county town of the Tianshu Province. It naturally housed its own branch of the Golden Dragon Bank, which was unsurprisingly located in the most luxurious area: the center of the city.As Li Luo got off the carriage, he gazed at the glorious and dazzling building before him. This was not the first time he had laid eyes on a building so grand, yet he couldn't help but exhale in wonder. Even a branch building in a simple county town exhibited grandeur beyond its humble surroundings. The financial resources of the Golden Dragon Bank were truly unfathomable.Even House Luolan's estate seemed lacking when compared to this behemoth.Jiang Qing'e's expression was calm and unperturbed. Upon exiting the carriage, she immediately made his way towards the bank with Li Luo in tow.After entering this magnificent bank, Jiang Qing'e withdrew a golden note from her belongings, which she then passed to an attendant. The note was carefully inspected before the attendant hastily and respectfully ushered the two into a VIP room.Moments later, a beaming, plump, middle-aged man waddled in. He was bedecked with all sorts of glittering jewels, each and every one of his fingers clad with numerous rings!\"Haha! I am honored to be in the presence of House Luolan's Young Lord and Miss Jiang. You have truly brought great honor to my humble dwelling.\" It is important to keep in mind that anyone who could act on behalf of the Golden Dragon Bank would definitely be socially adept. Since the plump man could recognise Li Luo at a glance, he also understood his current status. Yet he did not slight Li Luo in the least, and he provided him all due respect, even addressing him first.\"This is the supervisor of the Tianshu Province's Golden Dragon Bank, President Lu.\" Jiang Qing'e casually introduced the other party to Li Luo.\"President Lu, do lead us to retrieve the goods.\" With the brief introductions complete, Jiang Qing'e reverted to her usual swift and decisive demeanour.President Lu nodded and smiled, turning to lead the way. The three of them weaved through layers upon layers of restrictions before making their way deep under the building.Following President Lu's lead, the three arrived in front of a completely sealed room with no entrances. Instead, there were smooth, glossy, black stone walls on all sides, making it seem like a room surrounded by black mirrors.President Lu then lightly patted the wall. His actions made the wall split apart, allowing the group to enter the room. A box made of an unknown metal gradually emerged from the ground within the room.President Lu smiled as he explained, \"My respected guests, this is the object that the Lord of House Luolan left behind. In his words, the Young Lord has to retrieve this personally, and his blood will act as the key.\" With his job complete, he naturally slunk away, leaving the other two in the room.Li Luo stared at this safety deposit box of sorts, almost in a trance. Just what were his parents up to, leaving him with all this secrecy and mystery? What had they left behind?Yet his intuition was screaming at him, telling him that the object in front of him was of utmost importance. Perhaps it could change his ill fate?He took a deep breath and stepped forward, placing his palm on the strongbox. At this moment, he felt a piercing pain in his finger, as if a drop of blood was forcefully seized from him and absorbed by this strongbox!Click!Mechanical clicks could be heard coming from within the strongbox. A faint luster gradually emerged from the center as the strongbox cracked apart.At this point, Li Luo could finally see what was within.It was a pitch-black crystal ball. It was extremely smooth, so much so that Li Luo could even see his own reflection. There were clearly some unspoken mysteries surrounding this object.\"Just what...\" Li Luo mumbled as he blinked while inspecting the crystal ball.\"Let's store it carefully for now. Master said that you had to wait for your 17th birthday before you could retrieve this.\" Jiang Qing'e passed a suitcase over.Li Luo nodded as he carefully placed the black crystal ball inside the suitcase, tightly holding onto it for dear life as his eyes moistened.\"What's wrong?\" Jiang Qing'e asked with a puzzled expression.\"I have a hunch that my lucky break is finally here. I'm so emotional, I could cry!\" Li Luo exclaimed as he waved the suitcase towards her. \"Just you wait... I'm definitely going to succeed in annulling this marriage!\"\"....\" Jiang Qing'e couldn't be bothered to respond. She immediately turned around and left the secret room. She could clearly tell that Li Luo was surging with excitement and was definitely itching to irritate her.The two left the depths of the building and were once again greeted by President Lu. This time, he was accompanied by a young lady.She was garbed in green and was exceptionally beautiful, with an elegant and exquisite charm to her. Her fine, black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, reaching her willowy waist. This was coupled with a set of captivating eyes that shone brightly. Her snow-white skin gave off a crystal-like sheen. She was eye-catching, the very embodiment of perfection.Even though her hands were clad in thin, silk gloves, one could faintly make out her slender, jade-like fingers. If she ever removed those gloves, there would be people drooling at the sight of her ephemeral beauty.Possessing both beauty and temperament, this young lady was clearly a level above Difa Qing.Upon seeing her, an unnatural expression flashed across Li Luo's face before he regained his composure.\"Haha, this is my little niece, Lu Qing'er. She has just been accepted into Southwind Academy as a cultivator, and she absolutely idolizes Miss Jiang. When she heard you were here, she was adamant in coming along. I do hope that Miss Jiang will not take offense to this,\" President Lu explained as he clasped his hands respectfully with a smile on his face.\"Greetings, Senior Sister Jiang,\" Lu Qing'er said with deference as she graciously curtsied.Jiang Qing'e began to size up this new arrival with perfectly symmetrical features. \"Since you're a student of Southwind Academy, I suppose you're acquaintances with Li Luo?\"Lu Qing'er shifted her gaze momentarily to glance at Li Luo, who was standing by Jiang Qing'e's side. She beamed as she gently nodded, her deep gaze captivating all. \"Li Luo used to provide me with some pointers, and I've always been thankful to him. However, it seems like in these past two years, he hasn't wanted to meet me...\"Li Luo let out an awkward smile as he hastily and laughingly replied, \"No, no, no, no, no, please don't jump to conclusions! We are in different schools, so it's been very difficult to come see you!\" Deep down, Li Luo felt helpless. Lu Qing'er was exceptionally famous in Southwind Academy. She was in a completely different strata compared to Difa Qing. Not only was she attractive, she was the poster girl for Southwind Academy, being the number one talent in the current generation.When Li Luo was still attending the First School, many of the students had yet to open their resonant palaces. With his exceptional ability to utilise resonance arts, he was a cut above the rest of the students. Hence, numerous students would approach him for guidance, including Lu Qing'er.Therefore, they could be considered close friends.Then came Li Luo's misfortune of blank palaces and his subsequent booting from the First School into the Second School. As a result, their interactions became sparse.Of course, the most important point here was that Li Luo spent his time hiding from Lu Qing'er. It wasn't because he hated her, but because he felt embarrassed whenever they met! He used to be number one in the First School, and yet he had been supplanted by her\u2026Who would have thought that they would meet each other again?Lu Qing'er did not rebut Li Luo's clearly perfunctory words but didn't say anything else either. Instead, she turned her attention to Jiang Qing'e and began to chat with her with a casual smile on her face.The Lu duo then proceeded to escort the two out of the bank.\"Miss Jiang, I've heard that there will be an event happening at House Luolan,\" President Lu said with his usual, smiley demeanor.Jiang Qing'e's expression was unchanging as she replied flatly, \"President Lu is perceptive indeed.\"\"Ah, such a pity!\" President Lu sighed before continuing, \"Do look for me if there is anything I can assist you with. The Golden Dragon Bank believes that harmony breeds wealth!\"Li Luo held some doubts in his mind, but he did not voice them. He simply followed Jiang Qing'e onto the carriage, and they swiftly left.Meanwhile, President Lu rubbed the chin of his oily, portly face as he glimpsed at Lu Qing'er, only to realise that she was still staring wistfully at the direction of the departing carriage with her sparkling eyes.\"Cough!\" President Lu interrupted her. \"You little girl! You... you wouldn't happen to have feelings for Li Luo, would you?\"Lu Qing'er batted a glance towards President Lu as she gently replied, \"I only feel pity towards Li Luo. In the past, he did guide me in the resonance arts. I merely feel appreciation towards him. If not for his blank palaces, he would have been my greatest rival in Southwind Academy.\"President Lu patted his chest as he released a sigh of relief. \"Thank goodness! That's great... Qing'er, oh, Qing'er, he is already an engaged man. Don't try scoring when there's a goalkeeper... With your status and looks, just which youth in the Xia Kingdom could be your match?\"Lu Qing'er shook her head and then turned around to walk away, ignoring her second uncle's inane ramblings whilst he chuckled and continued to rub his chin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0005\u2013 Senior Pei HaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving the Golden Dragon Bank, Jiang Qing'e was silent within the carriage. Li Luo followed suit and spoke nary a word, only clutching the suitcase. Who knew what he was thinking.Eventually, they arrived in front of a manor, within which dotted numerous undulating hills and magnificent pavilions\u2014an awe-inspiring sight.This was where Li Luo's parents had constructed the family home of House Luolan.The four beastial lionhorses stopped gracefully in front of the gates and then the duo exited the carriage.\"This place seems to have become a lot colder and lifeless.\" Jiang Qing'e sighed as she stared at the manor.Back when Li Luo's parents were still around, this was the administrative epicentre of House Luolan. The bustling activity as people hurried about then greatly contrasted against the decrepit silence seen now.\"House Luolan's headquarters has long shifted to Xia City, this is just an old manor. I suppose this peace and quiet is expected.\" Li Luo smiled.Whilst the two spoke, some individuals approached the entrance to usher them in.At the fore was an old man, with a lady right behind him. The old man had a gentle and amiable expression. The lady, on the other hand, wore a face of makeup that accentuated her maturity, providing an attractive countenance. What was most outstanding was her well-rounded figure; her twin peaks were well endowed, much like two completely ripe peaches, a sight that would slay men as they swayed gently.\"Uncle Liu,\" Li Luo cried as he ran towards the old man. He was someone who had followed Li Luo's parents long ago. Nowadays, he stayed to maintain the estate whilst taking care of Li Luo.Yet Li Luo did not recognise this well-endowed lady and doubts began to arise in his mind.\"Uncle Liu, it has been a long time,\" Jiang Qing'e said as she nodded her head before introducing the lady to Li Luo. \"This is Elder Sister Cai Wei, my assistant in Xia City. She has been helping me to arrange the numerous affairs of House Luolan.\"\"Greetings, Young Lord,\" the mature beauty Cai Wei said with a smiling expression as her eyes sized Li Luo up.Li Luo nodded in reply. \"It must have been hard on you, Elder Sister Cai Wei.\"\"Elder Sister Cai Wei will be staying in the City of Southwind for a period of time. She will be taking care of House Luolan's affairs in the Tianshu Province and will be directly reporting to you in all matters,\" Jiang Qing'e explained.Li Luo was momentarily shocked. Ever since House Luolan's headquarters relocated to Xia City, nothing much had cropped up within the Tianshu Province and things had been stable since then. Now, in the blink of an eye, why had Sister Qing'e suddenly deployed such a capable individual to assume control of the situation?\"Has something happened?\" Li Luo queried as he sighed deeply.Jiang Qing'e's sudden return was clearly unrelated to his upcoming seventeenth birthday tomorrow.Jiang Qing'e paused in deep thought. Her usual, exquisite expression had turned cold as she strode towards the interior of the manor, Li Luo trailing right behind her.\"Although you've been left in the City of Southwind, I suppose you have not heard of the news surrounding House Luolan. I did not speak of these things for fear of affecting you.\" As they walked on the light gravel road, scattered light filtered through the leaves of the surrounding trees, bathing their path with warmth, contrasting against Jiang Qing'e's direct and cold words.Li Luo nodded. Although he did not take part in House Luolan's affairs, even a blockhead could guess that with the absence of his parents, House Luolan would be faced with turbulent winds.Starting a house within the Xia Kingdom was not such a simple task. The most important rule was that one had to have a Duke.Within the Xia Kingdom were five great houses, and House Luolan was one of them.Out of these five, House Luolan had the shortest history and had also risen the most abruptly. This was due to both of Li Luo's parents entering the Duke Stage.Mysterious Yang Duke, Li Taixuan.Misty Duke, Tan Tailan.A house with two Dukes. This was the key reason why House Luolan had catapulted into the ranks of the five Great Houses so quickly. Whilst the rest of the five Great Houses had long established histories, House Luolan was a complete upstart. As a result, this also meant that they had less of a foundation and barely any assets to speak of, and were thus weaker than the other four by a fair margin.This was originally not an issue as Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan's abilities were more than sufficient to cover this gap during this time.Hence, it was a pity that they both had disappeared.Losing their two main pillars of support, House Luolan's strength declined rapidly. At the onset of their disappearance, their reputation still served to deter any unsavory intentions. However, with the passage of time, the lack of news regarding Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan had ended up birthing rumors that they had met their demise in the Noble's War.House Luolan, as one of the five Great Houses, had numerous businesses under them. This was undoubtedly a fat, succulent piece of meat for any power within the Xia Kingdom. Numerous factions had been eyeing it covetously, drooling at the mouths for a potential bite.Thus, with the passage of time, Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan's inheritance had been gradually whittled down. A few wolves could barely resist the temptation in these past few years and had taken quite a few mouthfuls.With such a situation afoot, Jiang Qing'e had to put pause to her studies in the Astral Sage College to take over the affairs of House Luolan. As a result, her reputation in the Xia Kingdom had soared. Unfortunately, she had yet to enter the Duke Stage, so her strength was insufficient to deter this pack of hungry wolves. In this dire situation, she had chosen to give up some of the businesses, opting to recover them when the House had recouped its strength.By showing little resistance, it signalled to the wider world that the situation within House Luolan was terribly unstable, battered by the oncoming winds.Li Luo understood very clearly at this point that without sufficient strength, trying to guard a mountain of gold would only bring trouble to oneself. Patiently enduring was the sensible long-term strategy.\"I've heard of House Luolan's decline in these few years. Perhaps things have begun to stabilise?\" Li Luo asked curiously.Jiang Qing'e pursed her lips as she calmly replied, \"External pressure has temporarily reduced. However, the problem now lies within House Luolan's headquarters.\"Li Luo was dumbfounded for a second before he slowly asked, \"Is it due to Senior Pei Hao?\"Cai Wei stared at Li Luo with a flabbergasted expression.\"Although Sister Qing'e has not been in charge of House Luolan for long, your charm is unparalleled and your strength within the house is not insignificant. The only member of House Luolan who can compete with you is that Senior disciple my parents took in.\" Li Luo smiled as he explained his deduction.Pei Hao was a wandering vagrant in his youth. He had offended an enemy and would have been executed if not for the lucky intervention of Li Luo's parents. Seeing how pitiful he was, they accepted him into House Luolan and his talents were gradually unearthed, demonstrating his genius. When House Luolan officially made their mark, he was officially taken in as a disciple.With this background, Pei Hao's position in House Luolan soared into the heavens, and by the time of Li Luo's parents' disappearance, he had already accumulated quite a bit of power.When his parents were still around, Senior Pei Hao would often come to interact with Li Luo. Over the years, these interactions had gradually become more rare, especially after it was discovered that Li Luo had blank palaces...It was clear that Senior Pei Hao wasn't a very genuine person.\"Pei Hao has always objected to my control of House Luolan. He has also acted arbitrarily when it came to decisions regarding the house. His influence within House Luolan is not minor\u2014at least half of the Inner Council of Nine supports him. This has brought about some unsavory influences on the situation.\"Frankly speaking, if he was willing to act on behalf of House Luolan, then all of this would be tolerable. If not for Masters' orders, I would not have wanted to make a move and take control.\" Li Luo nodded in agreement. With Jiang Qing'e's personality, she definitely disliked this sort of responsibility. Focusing on cultivation would've been ideal, considering her gratuitous talents.Though in the end, all of these problems had arisen because the Young Lord just wasn't up to par. Both of them understood that with his current predicament of possessing blank palaces, he was helpless in such a situation. If they passed control to him, it would more or less spell doom for everything his parents had toiled for.Furthermore, in this world, might made right.\"It must have been hard on you, Sister Qing'e,\" Li Luo sincerely said from the depths of his heart.Jiang Qing'e shook her head. \"No need for this display. We are already engaged, and I'm also part of House Luolan... in case you already forgot and need a beating to remind yourself,\" she replied bluntly.Li Luo was speechless at this retort, whilst Cai Wei laughed while coyly covering her mouth, her appearance capable of moving anyone.Jiang Qing'e continued, \"Ever since the two Masters disappeared, everyone has been on tenterhooks. Although I have done my best to pacify everyone, the situation House Luolan is in is not something that can be resolved easily. Meanwhile, Pei Hao continues to goad and rally the support of the people, constantly seeking to suppress me. I've done some investigating, and I suspect that there are greater forces at play, secretly assisting him.\"Li Luo reached out to catch a falling leaf before musing, \"We seem to have raised a wolf in our home.\"\"Pei Hao will bring some men to discuss terms in the City of Southwind tomorrow. If we are unable to come to a consensus, the worst case scenario is that House Luolan will directly disintegrate and a heavy blow will be dealt to us.\" Jiang Qing'e's golden pupils seemed to become as icy as the cold of winter\u2014even a trace of killing intent could be seen.Li Luo raised his eyebrows in puzzlement. House Luolan was surrounded by wolves in the Xia Kingdom, and furthermore, there were even more tigers eyeing them from the sidelines. If they did fall apart, House Luolan would be severely weakened, and inevitable troubles would follow.All he could do now was sigh. He was just too weak, unable to influence the situation at all. The title of Young Lord within House Luolan was an empty one. In fact, people had completely disregarded and forgotten about him.Everything stemmed from being powerless.\"I apologize. I have been unable to help,\" Li Luo said.Jiang Qing'e shook her head as she lightly replied, \"Rest assured. Even if turmoil engulfs House Luolan, I will ensure it is rebuilt before I hand it back over to you.\" Li Luo did not reply. He didn't really mind either way. Even if House Luolan were the mightiest one around, it was ultimately external strength. In this world, only personal might was absolute.If he could enter the King or Duke stages at some point, all of these problems would disappear like a wisp of smoke.The two then entered their old home and had dinner. Immediately after, Jiang Qing'e excused herself and rushed off, evidently to make preparations for tomorrow.Li Luo did not disturb her. Instead, he spent two hours practicing the resonance arts before retiring to his room for rest.Try as he might, he couldn't fall asleep. When the clock struck midnight, he directly rolled off his bed and grabbed the suitcase before wrenching it open.He pulled out the mysterious, black crystal ball and carefully clasped it between his hands. Li Luo could feel his heart palpitating as it almost burst out of his chest in excitement.\"Father. Mother. Just what did you leave behind for me?\"Li Luo lightly patted his chest as he spoke self-deprecatingly, \"There's no way you left behind a birthday cake you made countless years ago... right?\" He gulped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A trace of anticipation, lashed with anxiety, was hung upon his gaze.He wanted to know just what sort of item would lead his parents to spend so much effort to squirrel away...\"Soooo... just how do I open this?\" Li Luo was doing everything he could to quash the feelings of anxiousness in his heart. Cautiously inspecting the ink-black and mysterious crystal ball, he finally decided to... use the most direct method instead. He tentatively pressed his palms against its surface.Weng!At the exact moment his palms contacted the crystal ball, the crystal ball emitted a slight shock! That originally shiny exterior liquefied and enveloped Li Luo's palms.At the same time, Li Luo could distinctly feel a sensation not unlike acupuncture, as though needles were piercing right into him, into his palms! As this happened, some of his blood was absorbed!The palms which were covered with the black liquid then began to radiate a bright light. Then, to Li Luo's surprise, two light apparitions gradually took form.Looking at the familiar silhouettes, Li Luo could feel a wave of nostalgia and yearning descend upon him.\"Dad, Mom...\" The male apparition was handsome, his body upright like a spear whilst clothed in white robes. He possessed an absolute charm and a warm smile, yet hidden within was a lofty and immovable presence that would bend to no one! Just looking at him brought others an indescribable sense of comfort and safety.On the other hand, the female apparition was garbed in violet, her long hair elegantly pinned up, her two hands leisurely placed within her pockets. She, too, was of incomparable beauty and held an unparalleled, dignified demeanor.These were Li Luo's parents, Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan.As Li Luo stared blankly at the two, the apparition of Li Taixuan began to speak. \"Haha, my little boy, now that you're seeing these imprints, I assume you are seventeen already. I believe that by this point, we are long gone.\"Tan Tailan, who was smiling happily at the side, also began to speak. \"Little Luo must have become even more handsome by now, right? Have any girls begun to court you in school?\"Li Luo rubbed his eyes as he mumbled to himself, \"Your son did not only become extremely handsome, he also became absolutely unmatched! Just who would dare to court me...?\"\"Are you feeling full of grievances right now? Do you feel that nothing has gone right for you?\" At this point, Li Taixuan began to chuckle again, as though he could see right through the frustrations in Li Luo's heart.His mom continued, \"Perhaps because of the blank palaces within you?\"At this point, Li Luo was shocked. By the time his blank palaces had manifested, his parents had been missing for years. Just how could they have known of his situation?\"Little Luo, don't be surprised. We used some special methods to observe your body's situation long before your resonant palaces manifested. In fact, you even have three resonant palaces.\" Tan Tailan soothed him with a doting gaze in her eyes.Li Luo's jaw dropped. So it seems as though his parents knew of his unique situation a long time ago. Then in this case, did his parents' disappearance have to do with this? Just where were they now? Were they still doing well? Why had there been no news since then?\"Little Luo, I would first like to tell you that just because you were born with blank palaces, it does not mean that you're crippled. In fact, based on what I feel, this is the strongest sort of constitution in this world. You don't have to feel dispirited at this, and instead rejoice!\" Li Taixuan's words were too earth-shattering, leaving Li Luo speechless.\"Dad... even if you want to console me, couldn't you do it in a less exaggerated way?\" Li Luo lamented. The blank palaces had already hampered his ability to cultivate; just what nonsense was he spouting about some mightiest constitution?\u00a0Dad, just who are you trying to scam?Li Taixuan had a wry smile as he explained, \"Your natural blank palaces cannot absorb or refine worldly natural energy. This has to do with the root of your power, and frankly... we have no solution for this.\"\"Since it's a blank palace, then just find some way to stuff something in!\" added his mom, with a beaming smile.Li Luo was now wrinkling his brows in consternation. This was easy to say but impossible to do! Resonances were determined from birth. Wanting to change this after being born was unheard of. He had even experimented with this idea, but to no success.\"In a normal situation, this would truly be undoable. However, ever since we discovered your situation, we have been working hard to find a solution.\"\"If you do your best, you're bound to succeed eventually! Indeed, the heavens did not disappoint us and we finally found it.\" At this point, Li Luo could distinctly hear the thunderous palpitations of the heart, and even his head felt dizzy as blood rushed to his brain in excitement.\"We poured through numerous ancient records and finally found a solution. This art is known as the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art. It allows one to forge acquired resonances. At the same time, it allows one to integrate their blood essence and soul, along with a chosen resonance, into the forging process. The resulting acquired resonance can then be absorbed into your blank palace.\"Little Luo, your naturally-endowed blank palaces may not necessarily be a bad thing. As natural resonances are too powerful and hard to control, we cannot pass the full art down to you. Instead, the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art is a much better fit for you, allowing you to forge your path as you see fit.\"If you want an elemental resonance, then you can work in that direction. Conversely, if you want a beast resonance, then go ahead and do just that!\"In future, your three blank palaces will contain three carefully constructed resonances. At that point, you will be greatly superior to those with a natural resonance.\"Li Luo's eyes shone bright like a diamond under light. The situation seemed salvageable. There were all sorts of resonances, and many people had no choice over the manifestation of their resonances. This was something that could not be changed. On the other hand, although he did not have any natural resonances, he had the benefit of flexibility and could essentially determine what sort of resonance he wanted!\"Little Luo, the acquired resonances produced by the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art also have another benefit,\" Tan Tailan added.Although these were just apparitions that were left behind, Li Luo snapped right to attention. Since they had said it was a good thing, then how could he dare to miss this?\"A standard natural resonance is usually only of one element. However, the forged acquired resonances from this art are not the same! They can have two attributes, one main and one supporting.\"These attributes can be fully customizable as you see fit. The power gained is as though giving a tiger wings! I've only ever heard of certain natural treasures that have allowed for one's natural resonance to gain a second minor attribute when taken. However, this effect is miniscule and is just a small additive layer of strength. This is completely different from your acquired resonances, which are forged with two attributes that are supplementary. The difference is worlds apart!\"Oh my gosh, this is just too awesome! Too great!\" Li Luo was jubilantly celebrating as he clapped and jumped for joy. He could easily understand the preciousness of this ability. If he chose to forge a fire resonance and then supplemented it with a thunder resonance, the combination of fire and thunder would bring about a multiplicative increase in strength!At this point, he couldn't help but become emotional. It looked as though his blank palaces were truly more impressive than those natural resonances!\"Cough. Of course, nothing is ever so perfect. Although your acquired resonances have numerous benefits compared to natural resonances, there is one glaring disadvantage: the forged acquired resonances will not exceed the fourth-grade,\" Li Taixuan clarified with a sigh.Li Luo was momentarily stunned by this revelation. A fourth-grade? This did seem slightly inferior. Compared to Jiang Qing'e's ninth-grade Light Resonance, there was a difference of more than half the scale!With such a stark difference in grade, it was very possible that the benefits brought about by the dual elemental resonance would not be able to bridge this gap.However, his hesitation was short-lived. His current situation was already as bad as it could get, so even a fourth-grade resonance would be considered decent!Li Luo's mom spoke dotingly as she reminded him, \"Of course, you don't need to worry. Even though your acquired resonance grade might be low, you can also utilize acquired resonance arts to eventually improve them.\"Li Luo was once again struck with yet another revelation! That was true indeed. This world contained many wondrous treasures and medicines that allowed one to increase the grade of their resonance. There was a particular profession known as resonance artificer. These people were able to refine and temper spiritual liquids and mysterious treasures that would improve one's resonance, and as a result, they were widely welcomed by all resonance cultivators.There were, however, certain constraints to using external means to improve one's resonance grade. There was usually a limit to the tempering process and, normally speaking, an improvement of a grade or two was the best possible result.In the case of acquired resonances, as the highest grade was fourth-grade, refinement would lead to a possible peak of fifth or sixth-grade.\"Is Little Luo worried about the physical limitations of refining one's resonances?\" Li Taixuan laughed as though he was reading Li Luo like an open book.\"Huh?\" Seeing his dad's wide smile, Li Luo's eyes widened and he couldn't control himself. Could it be possible that this wasn't the end? This weakness could still be made whole?As Li Luo greedily anticipated the next round of news, his mother let out a slight sigh and interrupted his father with a disgruntled expression. \"You idiot, you've just gone ahead and came clean with everything! Just what can I tell Little Luo now? Huh????\"Li Taixuan's expression changed as he hastily consoled her, \"My dear, I was in the wrong, I was in the wrong! Please explain the rest to our son and I won't do it again! Please forgive me!\"Upon seeing this familiar sight, Li Luo couldn't help but shake his head with a sigh. His dad's survival instincts were truly commendable. Was this something that had been beaten and ingrained into him?\"Brat, are you laughing at your father right now?\" That apparition seemed to know exactly how Li Luo would react. Snorting with dissatisfaction, he immediately began to speak in a serious tone. \"You are still young and have yet to understand. I am deeeefinitely not afraid of your mother. It's just that my love for her runs too deep! As I've often lectured you, loving your significant other is the most important rule of this family. When you eventually get together with Qing'e, you will also have to obey this law! Do you understand?\" When Li Luo heard those words, he couldn't help but let out a cold laugh. Whenever his father said those words, if not for the fact that this explanation was often accompanied by a sight of a reddened palm mark on his face, he would have almost believed in them!Yet when he mentioned Qing'e, Li Luo could only sigh. Qing'e had been intimately raised by his mom and hence their personalities were similar... And he was often on the receiving end of a beating without him having a clue why\u2026How would his life be in the future??With a heavy heart full of sadness, Li Luo raised his head and looked at his dad. At this moment, it seemed as though their gazes could transcend time. It was as though he could finally understand what his dad was thinking. For a brief moment, this father and son pair could feel a truly fateful connection with their hearts, one of intimate sorrow...\"Li. Tai. Xuan. Can you stop standing there and making a fool of yourself? You're wasting my time!\" Li Luo's mom enunciated with a single raised eyebrow, interrupting that brief moment of endearment between the pair.Without surprise, Li Taixuan nodded eagerly, demonstrating that he had heard those words clearly.At the same time, Tan Tailan turned to look at Li Luo, her tone turning gentle. \"The refinement limit is only applicable to natural resonances. This is because these external treasures, no matter how pure and pristine they look, inevitably contain some impurities at their core. It is the accumulation of these impurities that prevent a palace from completely sealing in the resonance's might. As a result, it makes it difficult to continue refining the resonance past one or two grades.\"However, Little Luo, your blank palaces don't have this limit. Natural resonances have specific affinities and thus external tempering materials will face some form of rejection from the resonant palaces. Your blank palaces have no affinities, meaning that they can accept anything.\"Thus, your resonances can continually be refined as they will not be rejected by your palaces! Although it will get increasingly difficult to refine your acquired resonances, there is a chance for you to perfect them.\"Hence, it's as I've said. Your blank palaces could very possibly be the world's mightiest constitution ever! The perceived disadvantages are just a key to greater success.\"Li Luo could feel his heart roiling in waves. He had suffered greatly due to his blank palaces in these past few years. When he had first manifested it, he was unwilling to believe it and even felt angry. His frustrations and furious cultivation still resulted in him remaining powerless. In the end, he could only accept reality as it was.However, now, with his parents' words, these blank palaces were not useless. In fact, he might have the world's best constitution?This new information brought tears to Li Luo's eyes.\"Little Luo, for your first acquired resonance, we have already extracted some of your blood essence and a strand of your spirit soul and refined something for you. It is within this crystal ball.\"The Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art is also within,\" Tan Tailan explained.Li Luo could feel a warm current surging through him as he immediately opened his clenched fists. \"Dad, Mom, thank you! Let's go, I'm ready! Transmit this acquired resonance and the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art to me. Let me finally gain the opportunity to be reborn and soar above others!\"At this point, Li Taixuan's expression became solemn and he became silent for a few breaths before speaking again. \"The last thing I want to let you know is that absorbing this acquired resonance is not as easy as you might think it will be.\"As the acquired resonance is assimilated, it will require massive amounts of blood essence. This is why we had to wait until you were seventeen before allowing you to retrieve this. Only at this age will you barely be able to withstand the loss of your blood essence.\"More importantly, what you will lose is not just blood essence, but also part of your longevity. Once this acquired resonance is absorbed, you will only be able to live for five more years... unless you're able to break into the Duke Stage and transform your body. Otherwise, that will be the end.\"This has been something that your mom and I have disputed for a long time. The price to pay is too great, but you, my boy, have grown up. So we have decided to lay the facts bare and let you make the choice yourself. Little Luo, will you choose to maintain the status quo and become a rich Young Lord? Or will you choose to assimilate with the acquired resonance and cultivate against the heavens, struggling to live while embarking on a path fraught with danger?\"If you choose the first option, then all you have to do is store the crystal ball somewhere and the previous process will revert. If you choose the latter, then reach into the crystal ball. The choice is up to you, but regardless of your decision, the two of us will always support you.\" After which, the two apparitions no longer spoke and merely stared at Li Luo with gazes full of concern and love.Li Luo, on the other hand, gradually eased himself into a sitting position, his eyes focused on the murky, black crystal ball with uncertainty laced within.Throughout the explanation, he had realized something. Since the benefits were so wondrous, why were there no drawbacks? It seemed that this was left for last.Now his choices were simple. Did he want to be a weak, little monster? Or a mighty, short-lived beast?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he had never expected that this hope would come with such a heavy cost.Li Luo would only have five years left to live.If in five years he could not enter the Duke Stage and undergo a life-changing metamorphosis, then he would come to an unsatisfactory end.Five years to become a Duke?He was only seventeen now, and in five years he would be twenty-two...Even after reaching deep into his knowledge, he had never heard of such a young Duke in the history of the Xia Kingdom.Exactly what sort of culmination of talent, opportunities, and effort would allow one to construct such a miracle?Li Luo did not know... and hence he could feel a huge sense of pressure envelop him. He even found it hard to breathe.The current him could continue to live a mediocre life. His parents had left behind House Luolan, which still possessed a decent amount of businesses. Even if he could not control any of it and gave it all up, he could still live the life of a leisurely Young Lord, free from any worldly worries.The path of the acquired resonance would place him on the edge, constantly struggling and making every second count. He would have to struggle and wholly strive, squeezing out every last ounce of potential, all to fight against the heavens and to eke out a shred of vitality, all just to barely survive.Two wholly different paths\u2014just what should he do?Li Luo closed his eyes, his heart engulfed in turmoil.His mind flitted through numerous scenes. He thought of the strange gazes he received from others at the academy. People often liked to say that a tiger had given birth to a dog. How could such illustrious parents give birth to a son with such poor abilities?He thought of the person with a pair of pure and beautiful golden pupils. Deep down, he did feel a sense of love and yearning towards Jiang Qing'e, this he did not deny. However, Jiang Qing'e's exceptionalism was attractive and she had a hoard of other fans. Such an elegant and unparalleled lady could only be matched by a man of heroic and extraordinary temperament. This was only human nature, and there was nothing shameful about it.When they were young, Li Luo and Jiang Qing'e often competed in all sorts of areas. However, due to all sorts of different reasons, Li Luo lost more than he won. As the two of them grew older, such interactions lessened.This was especially noticeable after their palaces manifested. Li Luo knew that the gap between the two had only widened, transforming into an uncrossable chasm.Jiang Qing'e had also begun to reduce their friendly competitions from that point on.The encounters over the years looked as though they had smoothened Li Luo's edge over time, as he seemingly became much more mellow. Only he knew that deep down, his desire to win and compete had never diminished, only further stoked ablaze by his apparent weakness.The reason he was willing to challenge Jiang Qing'e was not simply because he was coerced\u2014he wanted to do so.In a normal situation, even catching up to Jiang Qing'e, who had already left him in the dust in the cultivation race, was as impossible as surmounting the heavens. However, there was a brief sense of hope now.Was he going to give up on this hope?His real answer was that this was impossible!Li Luo eyes flashed open, and a trace of sharpness could be seen in his gaze.He stared at the apparitions of Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan before saying, \"Dad, Mom, I have always had a wild heart. However, those who know of my condition would laugh at me if they heard this, as if I don't understand my own situation... I'm not only interested in catching up to Sister Qing'e, I want to surpass her! And not just her, I want to surpass the two of you!\" A grin hung on his face, displaying his pearly-white teeth.\"I dream that in the future, people will not recognize me for being Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan's son. Instead, I want others to see you and know you as Li Luo's parents!\" He chuckled. \"Dad, Mom, I am very thankful for this gift you have left for my seventeenth birthday. Rest assured, I will not let you down. All I have to do is reach the Duke Stage in five years. No biggie. I, Li Luo, accept this challenge!\"As he made his final declaration, his eyes lit up with resolve and he no longer hesitated, reaching out with his palm, lightly pressing them onto the black crystall ball.Weng!The black crystal ball responded brilliantly, and Li Luo could feel a piercing pain transmitting through his palms. It was as though countless needles were piercing into him.At the same time, the black crystal ball began to shatter, and within its interior quietly lay two objects.One was a black-colored jade slip. As expected, this ought to be the instructions to cultivate the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art.The other item was mysterious-looking. It looked like a liquid and yet seemed to be an illusory item made of flowing light. It was azure in color and seemed to be emitting minute rays of sacred light.Li Luo's gaze was affixed onto that illusory liquid object.He knew that this was something that would change his destiny.... His parents had spent blood, sweat, and tears to refine this acquired resonance.Additionally, by merely setting his eyes on this strange object, Li Luo could feel a sense of compatibility with it from the depths of his soul.It was as though this was something that had always belonged to him.His parents clearly weren't lying when they said that this acquired resonance was crafted from his own blood essence and spirit soul. The compatibility between man and resonance was instinctive.\"Ah...\" \u00a0Just as Li Luo was completely enthralled by the mystical acquired resonance, a complicated sigh echoed from behind him.Li Luo raised his head and saw that his dad's apparition had begun to act again. The expression on its face was clearly filled with complications.\"Little Luo, it looks like you've made your decision,\" Li Taixuan unhurriedly said.\"As your dad, your choice does make me feel a little sad. However, from the perspective of a man, I feel relieved and proud of you. Your future path will undoubtedly be full of danger and peril. But as the son of Li Taixuan, how can these obstacles faze you?\"His mom's eyes were also splashed with a tinge of wetness. It seems that when they had left these apparitions behind, they had already predicted this outcome. Perhaps this feeling was also unbearable for her. As a mother, she found it hard to accept that her child would only have five more years of life.Yet she did not dissuade him, as she knew that this decision was for Li Luo to make. Furthermore, he had clearly made his decision, so she would do everything she could to support him and believe in him.\"Little Luo, since you have chosen your path, let Mom tell you exactly what sort of acquired resonance we have refined for you.\" Hearing his mom's words, Li Luo perked up.\"Your dad and I experimented with this acquired resonance countless times before finding the most compatible treasures to forge it.\"This is a 4th-grade water resonance supplemented with a light resonance.\"Li Luo was a little shocked before he gave a bitter smile. \"Wait... why a water resonance?\"Amongst elemental resonances, there weren't elements that were better or worse than one another in general. However, there were differences when it came to practical uses. If one was interested in power and penetrating strength, fire, thunder, and metal were definitely the best-in-class. Water resonances were usually more nurturing and defensive in nature; it was a more flexible sort of element.He had never imagined that his acquired resonance would be one that was more on the side of soft and yielding.\"Haha, Little Luo, you must surely be thinking that a water resonance is soft and weak, something that runs contrary to the strength you wish for in your heart. Don't underestimate the might of a water resonance. Although they might initially be more feeble in terms of sheer destructive ability, its affinity for vigorous, sustained attacks is unparalleled and will allow you to grind down any other element. If you are able to exhibit the strengths of the water resonance, it will not be any weaker than other elemental resonances.\"Furthermore your water resonance is not a normal one. It also has the power of a light resonance supporting it. If you are able to fully utilize the power of the two, the final result will definitely exceed your imagination!\"Of course, your parents did not just give you a waterlight resonance for no reason. There are two more important reasons for this.\"You will lose a large amount of your blood essence and a large portion of your life during your first absorption of a acquired resonance. It will inevitably bring about grievous injury to you. Water resonances are gentle, and this water resonance's power will nourish your injured body, allowing you to recover quickly.\" It was as though Li Luo had been enlightened. So this was the reason why. In terms of recovery prowess, a waterlight resonance would definitely be top tier in terms of healing.\"Then what's the second reason?\"\u00a0Li Luo asked curiously within his heart.Not before long, his dad continued to explain. \"The second reason is that we hope you become an amazing resonance artificer, to supplement your future cultivation\"Do you remember the fundamental requirement to become a resonance artificer?\" Li Luo paused momentarily.\u00a0\"Being a resonance artificer requires one to either possess a water or light resonance.\"When it came to cultivation, there were naturally numerous auxiliary professions that arose to support it. A resonance artificer was just one of many. They were able to refine and improve the grade of one's resonances with the usage of magical treasures.There were also alchemists; however, those required one to possess a wood or fire resonance.There were also resonant artifact crafters, those who could craft resonant artifacts used for battle. This required metal, fire, or earth resonances.resonance artificers and alchemists were similar in many ways. The key difference was that one improved the grade of their resonances, while the other directly increased resonant power.Water and light resonance cultivators had purifying powers, which was the key reason why they were ideal for becoming resonance artificers.\"But why do I need to become a resonance artificer?\" Li Luo was a little unconvinced.Just as he asked that question, Li Taixuan's voice once again continued his explanation. \"That is because you have a blank palace. You're able to undergo unlimited refinements of your resonance grades. If you become a resonance artificer, you will gain a deeper understanding of the process and your own palaces, allowing you to strive for perfection.\"Additionally, other resonance artificers either only possess a water or light resonance. Your waterlight resonance power, on the other hand, contains two elements that can mutually support each other. This is unheard of. If you don't become a resonance artificer, it would be a waste of a heaven-bestowed talent.\"The spirit liquids and purifying lights you produce will clearly outclass any made by any other resonance artificer.\"Tan Tailan then coyly covered her mouth and laughed. \"Little Luo, this is a back-up plan that your dad and I have left for you. If House Luolan has been squandered to destitution by you, you'll at least have a set of skills that will allow you to survive.\"Li Luo's jaw dropped at his parents' plan. In the end, he could only shake his head. He was absolutely speechless. He could only say that his parents had planned for every contingency. Even the profession they had in mind for him had been picked to capitalize on his first acquired resonance's strength.\"However, Little Luo, do keep in mind that this first acquired resonance is just the initial step. Your dad and mom were able to help you refine it with your blood essence and spirit soul. The processes of creating your second and third resonances will be increasingly complicated. You will have only yourself to rely on to discover the route ahead.\"We recommend that you break into the Resonant Master Stage before searching for a way to craft your second acquired resonance. We have left some possible suggestions on the paths you can take for it as well within the jade. Our experiences have also been recorded for your reference.\"The Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art within this jade will only allow you to craft a second acquired resonance. The complete method to craft the third acquired resonance has been left in Xia City for you to retrieve when the time is right.\"At this point, Li Luo noticed that the apparitions of his parents seemed to have dimmed a little. This led him to realize that this transmission was finally coming to an end.\"Dad, Mom...\" Li Luo couldn't help but to reach out and grab hold of the light apparitions, only for his hands to pass right through them.The two continued to look at him with gazes that were full of love and doting compassion.\"Little Luo, it looks like things are about to end...\"Your dad and mom believe that since you have chosen this road, you will definitely succeed in breaking out of this five-year limit.\"We know that you worry for us, but rest assured\u2014before we meet you again, nothing will happen to us.\"Lastly, Little Luo, you must remember that no matter how worried you are, you cannot search for us without reaching the Duke Stage.\"Finally, the apparitions began to flicker and eventually faded into thin air. The entire room was once again subsumed in darkness and silence.Li Luo continued to sit in front of the black crystal ball, his eyes watery and red. In the end, no tears fell. He rubbed his eyes and made a commitment.\u00a0\"Dad, Mom... Thank you for giving me everything. Please wait for me. When we meet again, I will definitely shock you and be your source of pride.\"He gradually composed himself, soothing the turmoil within. After which, he reached out towards the black piece of jade and stashed it away before his eyes landed upon the azure and sacred light-emitting object.\"From today onwards... I will be someone who has manifested a resonance!\"A blazing fervor could be seen within Li Luo's pupils, along with excitement that had finally reawakened. Without hesitation, he reached out towards the azure acquired resonance.Weng!At the moment of contact, he first felt an icy feeling wash through him, followed by an indescribable, acute pain exploding throughout his entire body.This acute pain intensified and built up, to the point that it completely overwhelmed Li Luo's consciousness. His vision suddenly turned black and his entire body gradually collapsed onto the ground with a heavy thud.1. QUIK MAFFSPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could faintly make out the shapes and colors of his familiar room as he struggled to open his heavy eyelids with all his might.\"Huh... this is... what?\"In an awakened stupor, he began to mumble incoherently. To his terror, he suddenly noticed that his voice was much weaker than it was before. He once possessed the vibrance of spring, but now he seemed to be like an old man with his life candle faint enough to snuff out from a breeze.Li Luo struggled to pick himself up from the floor, but even after half a day of struggling, he realized that he didn't even have an ounce of strength within his limbs.In the end, all he could do was resign himself to fate and remain lying on the floor for another half a day. Only then did he recover enough strength to stand up and plop himself onto a seat beside him.\"Young Lord, are you well?\" At this point, a female's voice could be heard. It seemed to be Cai Wei who was asking after him.Li Luo coughed and replied, \"I woke up a little late. What's up?\"\"Qing'e instructed me to inform you that House Luolan's Council of Nine's Pavilion Masters are all here and for you to get ready,\" Cai Wei's soft and pleasing voice continued.\"Alright.\" Li Luo glanced at a small crack by the window. The light that was coming through was especially resplendent. It was clear that he had laid around for the entire night.Hearing Li Luo's reply, Cai Wei felt that things were a little strange. Why did he sound so feeble? Regardless, she moved on and continued with her tasks.Li Luo then shifted his gaze to where he had placed the black crystal ball the previous night. To his surprise, the black crystal ball had vanished into thin air. There were just a few pieces of ashes remaining on the floor.It seemed that the black crystal ball had engaged a sort of self-destruct function, completely erasing all traces of its existence.Following which, he decided to take a glance at the mirror to have a look at himself. However, what he saw caused his expression to change uncontrollably.The man in the mirror had an alabaster-white complexion. This color would make one assume that all the blood within his body had been sucked away.What was most noticeable was that his once raven-black hair had turned a mix of grey and white. It was clear that the loss of his blood essence had brought about massive changes to his physiology.Li Luo stared blankly at the white-haired youth in the mirror and he spat out his thoughts. \"It seems that... I've become even more handsome.\" Finding joy even in the darkest times, Li Luo continued to muse, \"It seems that I've lost more than half of the blood essence my body has stored up over the past seventeen years. All to absorb this acquired resonance.\" The sudden loss of his blood essence had resulted in a situation where he felt exceptionally weak. Just the act of taking a few steps made him feel dizzy.On top of that, he could also feel an indescribable emptiness within him. This was not a matter of the heart, but rather the loss of his longevity.Li Luo pursed his lips. From this moment on, did he only have five years of life remaining?This would truly force one to feel the pressure of time ticking.He exhaled deeply and closed his eyes. It was time to understand his new body.He could perceive that where there were previously three blank palaces, there was now an azure light being emitted from his first palace. It continuously emitted comfortable and gentle rays of power that were gradually absorbed by this dried-up body of his.Li Luo's mind was solely fixated upon the azure-blue resonant palace. Although he had mentally prepared himself for this sight, actually witnessing it overwhelmed him with emotions.The acquired resonance assimilation was a great success!On this day, his issue of a blank palace had been resolved!Furthermore, his previously unwanted and troublesome blank palaces had turned into a wondrous opportunity for him.Opening his eyes, he could feel the worldly natural energy all around him, with two particular types of energy naturally attracted to him.They were water and light resonance power.In the future, he would be able to absorb these two energies for himself, turning them into his own resonant power.Till then, he would have to cultivate some energy cultivation arts. This was not a huge issue, because House Luolan possessed a strong foundation and hence had stockpiled numerous types.As Li Luo pondered over his future, he gradually stood up, took a shower, and changed to a clean set of clothes.After changing, he reassessed himself in the mirror once again. \"Hmm, I might be looking a little haggard and with a head of greyish hair... but damn do I look even more handsome and irresistible than before!\" Li Luo muttered as he gave a radiant smile.\"Li Luo, your new life awaits you!\"....Meanwhile, within an old manor in the City of Southwind, although it seemed a little deserted, today's atmosphere was rare and solemn. Numerous guards were patrolling the premises surrounded by layers upon layers of sentries.Within the main hall, the atmosphere was similarly somber. It felt hard to even breathe.The spacious hall was furnished with two opposing rows of seats. In the middle of those two rows was a pair of seats, one still empty, whilst Jiang Qing'e occupied the other. Her serene gaze was tinged with coldness.Her golden pupils indifferently swept across the hall, occasionally flitting towards the row on her left. Within that row was a group of four, all exuding roiling waves of energy.The strongest aura came from the one sitting at the head of the row.He looked to be a youth of around twenty-seven or twenty-eight. His features were ordinary, nothing outstanding. His eyes were deep and his nose was long and narrow. On his right earlobe hung a sword-shaped earring that glowed with a faint, cold light.His expression at this moment was extremely warm and a smile was on his face, making it easy for people to have a good impression of him.However, Jiang Qing'e was extremely familiar with the person in front of her. He was not some sort of benevolent individual. In fact, ever since she took control of House Luolan, he was the one responsible for causing her all sorts of impediments.This was Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan's disciple in name, an influential figure of House Luolan, Pei Hao.The three sitting below him were three Pavilion Masters of the Council of Nine.Sitting right across their row were the other six Pavilion Masters of the Council of Nine. Out of the six of them, four supported Jiang Qing'e, whereas the last two were neutral, supporting neither party.One glance at the way the rows were positioned made it abundantly clear just how turbulent the undercurrents of House Luolan had become.Without the two supporting pillars, Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan, the foundations were easily swayed by the elements and changes...It had been silent for quite some time, accompanied by the reverberating sounds of tea sipping around the hall.As though it was prearranged, the head of the left row, Pei Hao, suddenly placed his teacup on the table with nary an extra amount of force. The clear, crystalline ringing of the cup echoed around the hall, immediately causing the peaceful atmosphere of the room to come to a halt.Pei Hao raised his head and glanced at Jiang Qing'e whilst smiling. \"Dear Junior Sister, everyone has been waiting for almost half a day. Why has the Young Lord not arrived?\"\"Even though he is the Young Lord, everyone knows that we are here to decide upon the matters of House Luolan. I have to remind you that when the masters were around, everyone was punctual. This demonstrates his lack of regard for us.\" As he spoke, the expressions of the Pavilion Masters of the Council of Nine were varied. Some were unchanging, some frowned slightly, while the rest murmured in a soft tone.Jiang Qing'e apathetically replied, \"Why have I never seen you exhibit so much patience when \u00a0the masters were around, then?\"Pei Hao's eyes narrowed into a line as he smiled. \"Apprentice Sister, the future waits for no one, and we have to move forward.\"Pausing, he stared to look at the rest of the hall before continuing, \"Since the Young Lord is late and has not shown himself, I recommend that we proceed and not waste any more time. In any case...\" At this point, he had an exasperated smile on his face.\"... we all understand his situation. In fact, it's probably for the better that he's not around. Why not let him rest peacefully?\" Within the hall was a myriad of different expressions. Other than Jiang Qing'e, no one else had spoken since the beginning.\"Since no one has any disagreements, let us begin.\" Pei Hao continued to smile as he waved his hand, indicating that a decision had been made.Jiang Qing'e had an icy countenance at this point, but just as she was about to speak, cacophonous laughter rang from behind the beaded curtain in the room before the hall.\"Senior Pei Hao! It's been quite a few years since we've last met. You seem to have become somewhat... tyrannical! I suppose if my parents knew of how outstanding you have become, they would definitely have appreciated you a little more.\" As the laughter rang out, the beaded curtain lifted and a slender and handsome youth strode in with a smirk on his face.When everyone in the main hall saw that face, their bodies couldn't help but to shake involuntarily as everyone reflexively stood up as though conditioned to do so.That face was exceptionally similar to the one they respected from the depths of their hearts.Even Pei Hao's silly smile had stiffened for a brief moment upon his entrance. His body seemed to have bent slightly, and at the moment he was about to stand, his heart calmed down and he saw him for who he was.The person in front of him was not one of the two masters...This was just a blank-palace cripple!To regain order, he quickly raised his hand and crushed the teacup in front of him. A crisp and clear sound blanketed the room when the entire teacup turned into dust.This seemed to have awakened the nine Pavilion Masters from their stupor, and they quickly composed themselves.Following which, embarrassment could be seen scrawled all over their faces. The three Pavilion Masters on Pei Hao's side immediately took their seats.The remaining six Pavilion Masters hesitated for a brief moment before walking over to offer their respects to Li Luo.\"Greetings, Young Lord.\" As they focused more closely on Li Luo, they noticed that despite him resembling his parents in style, he did not possess the same awe-inspiring momentum. In short, he was still too young and immature.Although that illusion of grandeur only happened for a split second, it seemed as though they could no longer remain as calm as before.What made them feel the most surprised was Li Luo's head of grey hair.Even Jiang Qing'e was astounded by Li Luo's new hair color as she scrutizined him. This brat was clearly just fine yesterday...Li Luo reciprocated the greetings to the six and then glanced at the immovable Pei Hao, who was still rooted into his seat.\"Even though it's only been a few years since we've met, it looks like you've changed into a completely different person, Senior Pei Hao.\"Everyone within the hall could understand the implied meaning behind Li Luo's words, causing the Pavilion Masters' gazes to light up.In the past, when Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan were still around, Pei Hao would smile warmly and treat Li Luo gently, like a loving elder brother. He would often even spend time wracking his brains for appropriate gifts for Li Luo.Unfortunately, no one, not even Li Luo's parents, could have ever expected that this perennially respectful disciple would suddenly bare his fangs and reveal his true personality in the years they were gone.Pei Hao replied with that ever-smiling face of his as he observed Li Luo, \"It's been a while! Little Luo seems to have aged quite a bit,\"Following which, he paused and then frowned seriously, \"Though why is it that you've become so pale and your hair has turned white? It looks like at the rate that you're going, you barely have much longer to live.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who would have expected that this once amiable and friendly man would spout such poisonous and vicious words?Even though Li Luo's complexion was indeed pale and sickly, one didn't have to go so far as to curse that the person was doomed to die, no?The three Pavilion Masters beside Pei Hao clearly looked awkward in reaction to this chain of events. However, they did not speak and just continued to stare at the floor, as though the tiles were the most fascinating objects in the world.The other six Pavilion Masters, on the other hand, were clearly enraged.Peng!\u00a0Another large shock echoed throughout the room, surprising all. When they looked over, they saw that Jiang Qing'e's jadelike palm had slammed against the table, an absolutely icy expression on her face.Yet before Jiang Qing'e could speak, Pei Hao immediately patted his mouth and laughed. \"Sorry, sorry! I spoke out of turn and accidentally shot my mouth off. I hope Little Luo won't fault me for my accidental transgressions.\"Li Luo glared at Pei Hao as he sized him up before also breaking into a smile. Although he was accustomed to seeing the two-faced reactions of numerous people in the past few years, those were all outsiders. Pei Hao was someone who had been saved by his parents, and it was not an exaggeration to say that he had been given a new lease of life.Without Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan, Pei Hao would probably have had his four limbs broken by that family he offended and thrown into the sewers before being left for dead. Where would he even have the opportunity to attain all that he had now?Everything that this Pei Hao had revealed demonstrated a complete lack of gratitude for Li Luo's parents. On top of that, he even harbored a considerable grudge.This led Li Luo to sigh. His parents may have been wise and brilliant over the years, but even then, they were human and had made a mistake.\"No worries! This is just your true self leaking out. What is there to be offended about? To be frank, even if I were, what could I do about it? Hence, I won't say any superfluous words here.\" Li Luo shook his head and took his seat in the middle of the two rows.Pei Hao's face was full of mirth as he casually spun a thumb ring around his finger. He didn't seem to have taken any offense or become enraged at Li Luo's mocking words. There was no need to. It was as Li Luo had said, even if he was offended, what could Li Luo do?The House Luolan of today was no longer the house of the past.Without it's two immovable pillars, there was no one who Pei Hao feared.A hopeless Young Lord was only useful as a puppet. If not for Jiang Qing'e, he would very possibly have taken control of the entire House Luolan by now.\"Since the Young Lord is here, then I suppose the discussions can begin?\" Pei Hao turned to look at Jiang Qing'e.Jiang Qing'e remained expressionless as she apathetically replied, \"Why don't you start? Why haven't you contributed even a single piece of skygold from the three pavilions under your control to the house treasuries this year?\"Pei Hao lightly sighed and replied, \"The three pavilions under me are not doing well this year at all. Junior Sister, you might have already heard that all three pavilions have mysteriously burned down! I suspect it is the doings of those external powers that covet our House Luolan's businesses. I tried my best to investigate the root of the issue, but alas! My investigations turned up with absolutely no result! Hence, I have nothing to contribute this year!\"Li Luo merely listened quietly. Although Pei Hao's explanation seemed unbelievable and even comical, he did not interrupt. He understood that his words held no weight within House Luolan. The title of Young Lord was merely a superficial title in the eyes of everyone within the house.Thus, there was no need to speak out and court a rebuff.Jiang Qing'e gave Pei Hao a deep and firm look before saying, \"Is this your reason, Pei Hao?\"Pei Hao casually smirked yet again. \"Since Junior Sister wants a reason, then I will just give you a random one! Is there really a need to clarify certain things? Perhaps now that things have come to this, then let me make it clear to Junior Sister and the Young Lord. The three pavilions under me will not be contributing a single piece of skygold this year. In fact, from today onwards, they will not be contributing anything ever again.\" Pei Hao's light tone landed heavily on everyone's ears. It was as though a peal of thunder had crashed through the room, absolutely shocking all.Jiang Qing'e's body started to exude a cold air and the very atmosphere seemed to have congealed. Her icy tone chilled the hearts of everyone in the room. \"So it looks like you plan to defect?\"Pei Hao grinned before replying, \"I could hardly bear to leave House Luolan... It's just that there isn't an actual House Lord right now. Who knows what or where this skygold will end up if I pass it over? Perhaps when an appropriate House Lord is finally chosen, I reckon it won't be too late to submit my tithes.\"A depressing atmosphere pervaded the hall. The other six Pavilion Masters had ugly looks on their faces. If this was truly the case, then House Luolan would become the joke amongst the Four Great Houses.This was because Pei Hao had effectively already formed his own feudal army and demonstrated his intent to rebel and divide House Luolan up.\"Pei Hao, do you plan to destroy House Luolan? Do you think you will benefit from its downfall?\" a middle-aged man with a deep voice asked. His name was Lei Zhang, and he was a representative that supported Jiang Qing'e.Pei Hao shook his head. \"As I previously said, I don't wish for House Luolan's downfall.\"Pausing for a few breaths, he looked over at the silent Li Luo before continuing, \"Actually, I want to follow the rules. It's not impossible for me to contribute my tithes honestly... Of course, I hope that the Young Lord can promise me a single thing in exchange.\"Li Luo snapped out of his state where he was merely observing with his senses and his heart before affixing his gaze at Pei Hao. Curiously, he asked, \"I would like to know what sort of condition Manager Pei Hao has in mind.\"Pei Hao's eyes shifted from Li Luo to envelope Jiang Qing'e, taking in the sights of her icy and exquisite demeanor and her slender figure. A trace of fiery greed passed through the depths of his pupils.\"I hope that the Young Lord will annul the engagement with Junior Sister.\" After these words were spoken, the temperature within the room seemed to have dropped to absolute zero and everything froze.Li Luo was not furious, but rather seemed to have turned expressionless. He had often discussed the idea of breaking up the engagement with Jiang Qing'e and had even come up with a promise for the future\u2026Yet this was something between himself and Jiang Qing'e. The two of them were free to do whatever they wanted or say anything they wished between themselves... It was a personal relationship.On the other hand, Pei Hao had come up with such a ludicrous idea. Just who did he think he was?Bang!\u00a0Just as Li Luo's heart was turning cold and about to explode forth, a sudden influx of energy exploded outwards within the main hall.This energy was resplendent and bright, its radiance sweeping across all, bathing the entire hall with light rays.Immediately after, Li Luo could indistinctly make out Jiang Qing'e being wreathed in light and shooting outwards, leaving a wondrous afterimage behind.She headed directly towards where Pei Hao was sitting.This sudden attack also took Pei Hao by surprise, and so he could only stare. In the blink of an eye, his own body was also wreathed in golden light.The sword-shaped earring on his right ear quickly disattached and swiftly, like a storm, transformed into a golden longsword.Surging golden resonant power coated the longsword, increasing its sharpness. Additionally, an inordinate amount of colorful energy channelled through it, looking like countless rainbows.Dang!The collision of metal and gold clashed, resulting in an explosive shockwave of energy. At the same time, all of the furniture within the hall was blasted into pieces.The nine Pavilion Masters immediately acted and dissolved the remnant energy, trying to observe the aftermath.All they could see was two silhouettes locked in a confrontation with swords brandished. Jiang Qing'e against Pei Hao.Jiang Qing'e was clutching an epee, a sword dripping with resplendent light. The light was bright enough to dazzle the eyes, and if one were to stare at it for too long, they would undoubtedly feel piercing pain in their pupils!Who would have expected that this normally refined and pure goddess would be able to produce such shocking amounts of power in the heat of the moment!She possessed truly tyrannical light resonance power!On the opposite side of Jiang Qing'e stood Pei Hao, who was wielding a golden longsword. His body was emitting waves of golden resonant power that seemed unusually fierce and even sharp.This was metal resonant power.When the two swords clashed, resonant power exploded outwards, and even the floorboards were cracked to the point that patterns not unlike that of a turtle shell could be seen everywhere.Pei Hao, still unfazed, maintained a sweet smile. \"Ninth-grade Light Resonance. Its fame is well deserved. Junior Sister is just an early stage Earth Fiend, but your resonant power is already so domineering. It's clearly not inferior to my late stage Earth Fiend resonant power.\"\"Your metal resonance seems to have already been raised to the seventh-grade. It looks like you have squandered quite a bit of the tithes meant for House Luolan,\" Jiang Qing'e coolly replied.Pei Hao used to have a sixth-grade metal resonance, but during this particular clash, Jiang Qing'e could faintly feel that her opponent's metal resonant power had become even fiercer. Raising a sixth-grade to a seventh-grade would require a significant amount of spirit liquids and purifying lights.Pei Hao did not reply and instead the two immediately burst out with even more resonant power, their swords savagely colliding for another blow.Dang!The energy generated from the clash blew both parties back a few steps.\"How presumptuous of you, Pei Hao!\" At this point, Lei Zhang and a few Pavilion Masters appeared behind Jiang Qing'e, their expressions a steely green as they chided.At the same time, the other three Pavilion Masters stood behind Pei Hao, their stances clear as they prepared themselves.The sounds of the battle could be heard from outside the hall. At the same time, chaos was everywhere outside as well. Two waves of horses and men had rushed in, prepared to confront each other.\"Junior Sister, are you planning to let the entire Xia Kingdom know of our internal strife?\" Pei Hao gave a wry smile.Jiang Qing'e's had an unchanging, cold expression on her face, her gaze emanating waves of killing intent. \"Pei Hao, if you don't wish to die, then swallow those words of yours back into your defiled tummy. No one can interfere in our affairs, you have no right to.\"Pei Hao mused in silence for a moment as he frowned. \"Junior Sister, why are you acting this way? Isn't that engagement merely a burden for you? I know that you are very thankful towards our masters, but there is no need to be so committed towards Li Luo. He... just isn't a match for you.\"\"Cruel and unscrupulous dregs like you simply cannot comprehend what gratitude is,\" Jiang Qing'e insipidly replied.Pei Hao shook his head as he stared at Li Luo. \"Li Luo, it's best you smarten up. Otherwise, I will let you know the meaning of getting into trouble for hoarding a treasure! House Luolan is merely just a decoration to you. Junior Sister, on the other hand, is a talented genius and is something you do not deserve to have. Believe me, if you want to imprison her with the gratitude she owes your parents, then you will eventually bring about a catastrophe to yourself.\"Li Luo calmly replied, unfazed by his maddened words, \"You're trying to say that I should let go of both House Luolan and Sister Qing'e?\"\"If you're smart enough, then that is exactly what you ought to do.\" Pei Hao nodded before he continued compassionately, \"I am doing this for your own good. If you don't have any power, then you ought to curb your greed. This way, you might still have a way to become a rich and idle man.\"Li Luo smiled and replied, \"Pei Hao, aren't you worried about what will happen to you when my parents eventually return?\"Pei Hao's pupils shrank slightly and the expressions of the three Pavilion Masters behind him turned grave.In the end, Pei Hao shook his head. \"Li Luo, you should not hold on to such sad and naive hopes. Based on what I've heard, I'm afraid my masters will no longer be able to return.\" As he looked at Li Luo, he gave a sympathetic sigh.\"Hence, your pillar of support is gone. Are you any different from me when I was powerless? No! In fact, I doubt you could even match up to me at my worst\u2026 Even at my worst, when I had no support and was poor and destitute, I still possessed some potential.\"You, on the other hand.... you... have... nothing!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These words infuriated the Pavilion Masters who were siding with Jiang Qing'e.At the same time, they couldn't help but to look over at Li Luo. What was most surprising was that he seemed to be completely indifferent to those words. This led them to heave sighs of relief and at the same time taste a tinge of regret. This young lord may have been cursed with a blank palace, but his heart was unyielding and firm, something commendable considering his situation.Pei Hao also noticed that Li Luo was unfazed by his words, making him feel astonished. Perhaps this was not unexpected. Li Luo had changed over these past few years. Perhaps he had already accepted the gravity of the situation.\"Are you done blabbering?\" Li Luo retorted calmly.Pei Hao returned his reply with a dull smile.\"Actually, I've been quite baffled by this series of events. My parents have clearly lavished you with their favor. Why are you acting as though you possess an immense grudge against them?\" Li Luo asked.Pei Hao paused for a moment in thought and replied, \"My masters have indeed treated me well. Yet they have always known what I truly wanted: to become a full-fledged disciple. Not just a mere disciple in name. For this goal, I labored for House Luolan endlessly, and what did I get? They never so much as opened their mouths to accept me! Can you understand how many times I've anticipated this reward, only to be disappointed?\"Li Luo laughed. \"Is this what it means when one says if you provide too much help in a time of need, the person becomes reliant on you instead? In retrospect, what my parents did was right. With your ungrateful and vicious personality, it would be akin to inviting a blind and vicious wolf into our home. Imagine if you had become an actual legacy disciple... Just what more would you have done? Giving you the position of an actual disciple would only have amplified your wild heart, making it even easier for you to take control of House Luolan.\"Pei Hao shook his head to disagree, unwilling to further quibble with Li Luo regarding that. \"It looks like you aren't interested in my proposition, then?\"Li Luo shook his head. \"Stop wasting your effort. This marriage agreement is something between Sister Qing'e and I. It will not change based on your threats.\"Hearing his reply, Pei Hao sighed lightly, \"Li Luo, greed will only lead to your reckoning. This is no longer the past. You no longer have any capital here.\"Li Luo's gaze was affixed on Pei Hao. Despite Li Luo having a much weaker aura compared to Pei Hao, his fervent gaze possessed something that led Pei Hao to feel mildly uncomfortable.\"I will redirect the same words back to you.\" As he spoke, Li Luo's expression became dead-serious.Pei Hao naturally laughed. \"Li Luo, do you really believe that Junior Sister will always be there to protect you? How childish and naive. Since you don't agree with my suggestions, let's leave it at that. From now on, it's as I said. The three pavilions under me will no longer contribute a single tithe to the House. Similarly, any commandments made... will not be implemented... depending on my mood.\"The expressions of the six remaining Pavilion Masters within the hall gradually turned frigid.Two of the six were still trying to stay neutral. However, if Pei Hao truly wanted to carve apart House Luolan, their interests would also inevitably be affected.If this was the case, they would unfortunately only be able to obey Jiang Qing'e's orders and suppress the other three pavilions and Pavilion Masters.If things were to escalate to that point, House Luolan's dirty laundry would indeed be aired to the public eye and all of the powers within the Xia Kingdom.\"What? You wish for me to show my hand?\" Pei Hao could feel their cold gazes bearing upon him as he chuckled.Looking at Pei Hao's jubilant expression, Lei Zhang and his fellow Pavilion Masters held themselves back in fear of the consequences of aggravating this beast. What was true in Pei Hao's previous exchange with Li Luo was that his contributions to House Luolan had not been minor. When House Luolan was ascending through the ranks, he had exerted himself greatly, reaping the lives of numerous strong foes.Pei Hao had even become a late stage Earth Fiend. Other than Lei Zhang, who was a middle stage Earth Fiend, the rest were only early stage Earth Fiends.In this group, perhaps only the ninth-grade Light Resonance-wielding Jiang Qing'e could be his match.Most importantly, Pei Hao wasn't just a single individual. He possessed a veritable army and three Pavilion Masters on his end as well.If all hell were to break loose, it would announce to the world House Luolan's internal strife and the House's position within the Xia Kingdom would become even more untenable, to add insult to injury.\"Everyone, my aim here today is not to engage in meaningless gossip. What I wanted to do was find a solution that would allow House Luolan to continue to stand tall within the Xia Kingdom.\"If Junior Sister is willing to annul the marriage, then I'm willing to work together to bring House Luolan towards a new era!\" Pei Hao's gaze flitted around the group with his ever-present smile.\"Now that things have come to this, I can only blame a certain Young Lord for being too greedy... It's time to settle things.\" At this point, he produced a medallion. On it was engraved the word \"Mo\". This immediately set off a chain of different expressions amongst the group when they realized what it was.\"Is this Elder Mo's medallion?\" Lei Zhang quietly asked.In House Luolan, other than the nine Pavilion Masters, there were also three respected ancestors holding high positions. They were the mightiest warriors of House Luolan, excluding the two House Lords, and they were all Heavenly Dipper Generals.Normally, these ancestors would not interfere in the mundane matters of House Luolan, only rising to the occasion when dealing with enemies that brought about existential danger. This was the agreement that Li Taixuan had made with them.Specifically, Elder Mo was the strongest amongst the trio.Who would ever have imagined that the one who was most obligated to protect House Luolan would instead pass his authority medallion to Pei Hao. This was a clear indication of his stance.\"When Master first invited the three ancestors to join, he said that they possessed the power of supervision. Whoever is capable of obtaining the support of two ancestors and four Pavilion Masters by next year's meeting will have the right to become the House Lord of House Luolan.\"Pei Hao grinned. \"Hence, you don't have to be concerned about me tearing House Luolan apart. What I truly want is the complete whole.\"The entire hall was shocked. No one had expected this turn of events, nor for Pei Hao to raise this possibility.Judging from the current developments, he did indeed have the possibility to succeed. It was clear that he had long made preparations for the sake of today, taking effect immediately after the House Lords had disappeared.Pei Hao's gaze then turned onto the icy Jiang Qing'e and then to Li Luo at the side. \"So treasure this remaining year's worth of time. You might no longer have any affiliation to House Luolan after the next housemeet. At that point, you will truly have nothing!\" After delivering his ultimatum, Pei Hao turned and strode away, the three Pavilion Masters in tow.With Pei Hao's departure, the frigid atmosphere previously found in the hall gradually warmed up. Yet the countenances of the ones remaining were tinged with sadness.Although they had made certain preparations for the housemeet, when push came to shove, it had still caused quite a headache.What was commendable was Jiang Qing'e being able to remain cool and collected the entire time. She immediately reassured the six Pavilion Masters and delegated some important matters before letting them go.After which, silence descended upon the hall again.Li Luo's eyes were fixated upon the floorboards until his view was filled by a pair of straight and slender jade-like legs. Only then did he snap back to reality and raise his head to look at the person in front of him. His gaze met Jiang Qing'e's, quietly watching him with her alluring, golden pupils.\"Even though you seem to be calm on the outside, you must be seething on the inside, huh?\" Jiang Qing'e casually asked.Li Luo gave a bitter smile. \"How can I not be angry?\" Pei Hao had treated him as though he was non-existent. Combined with the request to annul the marriage in front of the House, it was akin to being stomped in the face.\"However, your performance was admirable. You never lost your cool.\" Jiang Qing'e's dainty, red lips rose into a slight smile as she praised him.\"If only I was strong enough. I would have smashed him to a pulp on the spot and assisted my parents with some housekeeping matters...\" Li Luo sighed. Staying calm? Wasn't this because he could do nothing else?At this point in time, Li Luo gained a greater appreciation for the importance of personal strength. The Young Lord without his parents was worth nothing at all.He did realize that what was most important now were his blank palaces. Everyone thought that he was powerless and hence underestimated him.\"No one will ever have a smooth life. Exercising forbearance is a virtue,\" Jiang Qing'e explained.Li Luo nodded in agreement. \"After experiencing today's housemeet, I now understand just how much trouble House Luolan is in. These two years must have been hard on you, Sister Qing'e.\" House Luolan's ascent to the top had been too rapid and a solid foundation had not been laid, resulting in the situation seen today. The moment the founders disappeared, the tower they had built was no longer stable.If not for Jiang Qing'e's two years of blood, sweat, and tears, perhaps the predators looking to tear the place apart would not only just be Pei Hao.Jiang Qing'e took a seat as she elegantly folded her alluring, white, and slender legs together. \"Don't take what Pei Hao said to heart. I will deal with him. All I need is a little bit of time.\" After saying this, killing intent could be seen emanating from her pure-gold pupils.\"Since the two of us already had an agreement, then I will naturally carry it out. I will hand House Luolan to you in one complete piece. Thus, don't take to mind the problems faced by House Luolan today. What you need to focus on is Southwind Academy's final examination happening next month. If you are able to enter the Astral Sage College, all these problems will naturally resolve themselves,\" Jiang Qing'e gently said.At this point, she paused and tilted her head slightly and smirked. \"Of course, if you feel that your chances aren't too good, just let me know. I can treat your agreement as something you said at the spur of the moment and won't hold it against you.\"Li Luo blinked before extending his hand. \"Pass me your hand.\"Slightly suspicious, she inspected the hand in front of her and paused for a moment. If it were some random stranger who had asked this of her, they would most definitely get a sword chopping towards them in return. Li Luo, on the other hand... they did have a special relationship after all.Hence, she expressionlessly extended her own dainty hand, placing it within Li Luo's palm.Li Luo tightly grasped her small hand, that delicate feeling causing one's heart to sway. Perhaps it was due to her light resonance that her skin was an exceptionally sparkling snow-white, like the most beautiful of jade, the downfall of a kingdom.However, Li Luo suppressed his urges to fondle her hand gently, instead circulating a tiny amount of resonant power to be emitted from the palm of his hand.The previously calm Jiang Qing'e's expression changed swiftly when she felt that weak amount of resonant power come forth.Grasping Li Luo's palm tightly with her slender fingers, she directed her consciousness towards Li Luo's body. It was then that she discovered that Li Luo's previously blank palace was now emanating an azure radiance!Jiang Qing'e was a little shocked at Li Luo's smug look. \"This... is a water resonance? You've manifested a resonance?\" Her mind in shock, she only released her grip gradually after a long while. \"Is this what the Masters left behind for you?\" Li Luo nodded.Jiang Qing'e exhaled lightly before speaking. \"This seems to be the best piece of news all day! Although your water resonance is not of a high grade, it seems to have an unmatched sort of purity to it. Perhaps this is because the Masters utilized treasures from the heavens and earth to craft it. Regardless, this is still an excellent beginning.\" It was clear from Jiang Qing'e's facial expression that her mood had improved. Even her slender eyebrows were no longer furrowed in thought.She even joked, \"Congratulations! Eh? It looks like you've finally made it a tiny step closer towards annulling the marriage agreement!\"But she was faced with a serious question now. \"Do you think his words about my parents were true?\" Li Luo smiled helplessly.Jiang Qing'e's long eyelashes gently fluttered as she blinked. \"Although I don't know where he got his sources from, I personally feel that with how shortsighted he is, how could he possibly comprehend how mighty the Masters are? Furthermore, I believe that the two of them have only been restrained temporarily. They are definitely fine and free of harm.\" Li Luo gradually nodded vigorously in agreement.\"I feel the same way too.\"Jiang Qing'e stood up and walked to the window. At this point, the sun's rays bathed her exquisite body with resplendence, each ray tracing her every movement, a truly soul-stirring sight.\"I will return to Xia City tomorrow. If you need me for anything, let Cai Wei know. She will remain in the Tianshu Province for a while, helping to tidy up House Luolan's affairs\"After settling a few more matters, Jiang Qing'e turned to look at Li Luo. The sun had yet to set, and its light shrouded her perfect silhouette.Those golden pupils looked even more radiant with such a background, an eye-catching and unforgettable sight.\"And so, Li Luo.... I hope that the next time I see you, you'll already be part of the Astral Sage College,\" Jiang Qing'e, with that ever-beautiful smile on her face, quietly murmured to herself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0011\u2013 Energy Cultivation ArtsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day, right at the gates of the old manor.Li Luo's gaze followed Jiang Qing'e's departing carriage as it disappeared into the distance. Beside him stood Uncle Liu with his hands behind his back, and Cai Wei with her exceptionally developed body.\"Hu.\" As Li Luo continued to stare at the carriage which had been swallowed up by the wilderness, he released a light exhale before turning to speak to Uncle Liu. \"Uncle Liu, please assist me with applying for a week's leave of absence from the academy. I wish to recuperate for a period of time.\" As the absorption of the acquired resonance had drained him of too much of his blood essence, going back to the academy would only invite gossip and rumor-mongering.Now that he had a water resonance, the most pressing concern was to find an appropriate energy cultivation art. Only this would allow his body's resonant power to quickly increase.Southwind Academy might possess numerous cultivation arts, but there were countless restrictions and conditions to borrow them. It was incomparably more convenient to tap upon his family's resources and private library.The only issue was the exam taking place in a month's time. Even this simple act of taking a week off from school would undoubtedly invite speculation from countless individuals. The only good thing was that at this point in time, Li Luo no longer cared about what others thought of him.\"Yes, Milord,\" the honest Uncle Liu responded before proceeding to carry out his instruction.\"Elder Sister Cai Wei,\" said Li Luo as he turned to face her.With her narrow and charming eyes, she gave a reserved smile. \"Please instruct me, Milord.\"\"Please assist me with obtaining some spirit liquids and purifying lights, those of the fourth-grade.\" Li Luo smiled.Her lush eyelashes blinked at the request. These were treasures used to improve the grade of one's resonance. Wasn't Li Luo born with a blank palace? Just what was he trying to do?Although her heart was full of confusion, she nevertheless agreed. \"How many portions does the Young Lord require?\"Li Luo pondered for a moment before replying, \"Why don't we start with fifty.\"Although Cai Wei was a calm and rational adult, upon hearing of the request for fifty portions, she stared at Li Luo blankly. Had she heard incorrectly?\"Young Lord, did you say FIFTY portions of fourth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights?\" Cai Wei couldn't help but ask him to clarify.Li Luo saw her confused gaze and nodded attentively.Cai Wei's pearly-white teeth bit down upon her dainty, red lips in shock. Spirit liquids and purifying lights were exceptionally valuable and expensive, and fourth-grade ones were even more pricey! At current market prices, one portion would cost a thousand pieces of skygold. Fifty would be fifty thousand!House Luolan's profits from across the entire scope of its businesses, when aggregated, was only about thirty thousand pieces of skygold! Furthermore, over these past few years, their profits had decreased as a result of the family's situation.Honestly, this amount of skygold spent was not a significant problem. House Luolan was considered a behemoth with numerous family businesses. Fifty thousand skygold was not enough to give rise to hesitation from Cai Wei's perspective. It was just that this entire request to purchase fifty portions of fourth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights seemed weird and outlandish.Spirit liquids and purifying lights' main usage were to temper one's natural resonances, to increase their grade. It was common knowledge that all spirit liquids and purifying lights possessed some form of impurities that would gradually corrupt one's resonant palace. Over a period of accumulation, this would eventually seal one's resonant palace, and at that point, tempering it any further would be impossible, reaching its final peak.People who utilized these spirit liquids and purifying lights would not do so wantonly. They would control the frequency of this tempering, perhaps only once or twice a month. This would reduce the effect of the impurities on one's resonant palace and bring out the greatest tempering effect from these treasures.Thus, even if one wanted to buy spirit liquids and purifying lights, it would only ever be in small quantities. In spite of all these conditions, Li Luo had come out with a bang and asked for fifty. Just how many years could one use them for?Cai Wei could not comprehend just what Li Luo was trying to do... this sounded insane.However, Li Luo was the Young Lord, and Jiang Qing'e had left specific instructions for her to acquiesce to any of Li Luo's demands. Resigned, she nodded lightly in agreement.\"Alright.\"\"Then I will have to trouble Elder Sister Cai Wei.\" Li Luo gave a vibrant and warm smile before turning to enter the old manor.Cai Wei stared at his leaving figure before heaving a sigh. This Young Lord seemed a little reckless. Even after being part of yesterday's altercation, was he still unaware of the numerous internal and external dangers that surrounded House Luolan?Even though he was a cripple with no ability to directly assist Qing'e, he didn't have to cause trouble, did he? Just how long would it take for House Luolan to recoup the losses from the Young Lord's wanton spending habits?At that point in time, was he going to request Jiang Qing'e's assistance on top of that? House Luolan's situation was already unstable and required large amounts of skygold to begin with!Gradually, she massaged her temples to calm herself down. It looks like she would be placed in quite a few predicaments during her short stay at the Tianshu Province.Meanwhile...Li Luo did not bother to think too much of the numerous dilemmas Cai Wei was grappling with internally. In fact, he was happy! He felt as free as a bird and full of hope for the future. He directly made his way to the old manor's library.The library was the repository for all of House Luolan's acquired cultivation arts and resonance arts. Even though the majority of them had been moved to Xia City's headquarters, the ones remaining within the old manor were still numerous.And hence this was also the most important location in the entire old manor. The force guarding it was not to be underestimated, as numerous protectors could be seen in its vicinity.This was where the benefits of being the young lord could truly shine. Li Luo merely had to walk right in as was his right!The librarian was a little surprised to see Li Luo come in and was momentarily left in a daze. However, he quickly recovered and respectfully greeted him. \"Young Lord.\"Li Luo nodded in response before instructing, \"Find every single energy cultivation art that is appropriate for a fourth-grade resonance and bring them to me.\"Upon hearing his command, the librarian was a little confused as well. When Li Luo visited the library in the past, he would only ever look for resonance arts. Energy cultivation arts were completely ignored as he had a blank palace and they weren't of much use to him.Regardless, he would not dare to object or be concerned with the reason. Li Luo WAS the young lord. He was technically the one with the highest authority within the old manor.Hence, he immediately followed the command, swiftly beginning to search for the energy cultivation arts that Li Luo had requested.Li Luo, on the other hand, found himself a simple, quiet room to patiently wait in. Before long, the librarian rushed in with a pile of jade slips, completely drenched in sweat.\"Young Lord, all of the energy cultivation arts suitable for a fourth-grade resonance can be found here. There are twenty-eight Entry Stage arts and six General-level arts.\" Li Luo nodded in affirmation and signalled for him to leave. Following which, he began to carefully browse through them.Within the Xia Kingdom, energy cultivation arts could be divided into several grades. Their grading system was similar to the way stages of power were differentiated: Entry Stage, General Stage, Duke Stage, King Stage. Except for the Entry Stage, there were also minor differences where each cultivation art level was further split into high-grade, middle-grade, and low-grade.Entry Stage energy cultivation arts could allow one to cultivate from the Ten Seals Stage to the beginning of the Resonant Master Stage. However, if one wanted to truly enter the first Resonant Master Stage, the General Stage, then they would require the usage of a General Stage energy cultivation art and so forth.Entry Stage energy cultivation arts were common like flies and relatively similar. Only General Stage energy cultivation arts and above were more scarce. Usually, only middle-tier powers possessed them.Duke Stage energy cultivation arts were even rarer. Only top-tier powers would possess these.On this note, Li Luo remembered that House Luolan possessed two complete versions of Duke Stage energy cultivation arts, left behind by both his parents.With regards to King Stage energy cultivation arts... this was precious beyond comparison. If one truly appeared in the open, it would most definitely incite the attention of all of the mightiest powers within the Xia Kingdom. There would undoubtedly be a clash of the titans in that scenario.In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the entire kingdom would descend into war just for it.Normally speaking, higher grade energy cultivation arts also tended to be more harsh on the cultivator's body. They had numerous sorts of requirements on the grade of the resonance.As Li Luo's waterlight resonance was only fourth-grade, he had only requested energy cultivation arts that he could utilize.As time went on, all of the jade slips before Li Luo were swiftly reviewed.He eventually narrowed his choices down to three energy cultivation arts.Nine Stages Throughput Art, low-grade General Stage.Azureflood Meditation Diagram, middle-grade General Stage.Spirit Transformation Art, middle-grade General Stage.These three energy cultivation arts were all at the General Stage. When cultivated to their peak, they would allow one to enter the General Stage.These three were of a decent grade, and although not the best, they were still nothing to be scoffed at. Most importantly, they were suitable for Li Luo's fourth-grade waterlight resonance.He would await the day that he tempered his resonance before looking for a more suitable energy cultivation art. This would not be a significant problem.After further deliberation, he eventually settled upon the Azureflood Meditation Diagram. This art specialized in allowing the cultivator's resonant power to be emitted in a continuous and robust wave, much like a raging sea. It seemed fitting for Li Luo's waterlight resonance.\"You're the one!\" Li Luo stowed the jade slip away and excitedly got up to leave the small room. He then made his way to a secret chamber below the library, something which his parents had specifically constructed for cultivation.It was here where he would finally embark on the path of cultivation.1. TLN: If my math checks out... maybe 25 years? :PPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0012\u2013 Cultivating Resonant PowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Luo entered the lowest level of the library, where he encountered a massive door made of an extraordinary spiritual metal. Utilising a drop of his blood allowed him to open it.What lay behind the door was a brightly lit cultivation chamber.This cultivation chamber was not as simple as it seemed. The purest of skygold was utilized as the main material for its construction. Skygold was a metal that was usually buried deep under the ground, created from the accumulation of worldly natural energy congealing into a physical form. This was the reason why it was such a special and highly sought-after metal.Hence, skygold was not just a form of common currency, it could also naturally attract copious amounts of worldly natural energy to itself. A cultivation chamber built out of skygold would thus be a standard requirement for cultivators amongst mighty powers, greatly increasing the speed at which they could cultivate.\"This truly is extravagant.\" Li Luo took slow steps as he entered the chamber, sighing in amazement at the sight around him. His parents had spent almost one hundred thousand pieces of skygold to construct this. Practicing his energy cultivation arts here would most definitely provide twice the results with half the effort. Till now, only Jiang Qing'e and him were allowed to cultivate here, and for that matter, this was his very first time stepping within.This was truly a house made of gold.It has to be said that one got what they paid for. The skygold was truly not wasted, as merely standing within the room allowed Li Luo to sense the immense difference in density of worldly natural energy compared to just outside.Sighing again at how lucky he was, Li Luo moved towards the center of the chamber. Within which were two stone platforms, each with their own mats. Clearly, this was where his parents sat when they cultivated here.Li Luo picked one of the mats at random and sat cross-legged with both hands grasping a jade slip, his eyes closed. He began to chant the incantation recorded from the Azureflood Meditation Diagram in his heart.At the same time, his breathing followed the pattern prescribed by the art, gradually inhaling and exhaling.Six exhales followed by three inhales. Nine shallow breaths followed by four deep ones... Li Luo began to adjust his breathing patterns, causing the effects to fluctuate.In the beginning, he would often make mistakes unknowingly, but his amazing perception and talent gradually revealed themselves. He quickly managed to grasp the underlying principles behind the Azureflood Meditation Diagram and truly entered the Ten Seals Stage.As Li Luo sat on the mat, his eyes were closed tightly and his mind was fully focused. As time passed, it was as though he could hear the waves of the sea, ebbing and flowing.The name of the art, Azureflood, was the key to understanding the grand meaning of this art. Li Luo imagined himself sitting within a raging sea, allowing the mighty waves to crash around him.Little by little, he could feel the worldly natural energy all around him start to surge. Within that cacophony of energies, the water element energy was sensed most distinctly. There was also some light element energy that could be felt.These energies were guided by Li Luo's breathing exercises, gradually being absorbed by his body through his numerous pores.Water resonance power was gentle and comforting, light resonance power felt incomparably pure...The two forms of energy began to happily roam around his body, and under their influence, Li Luo's previously withered body gradually regained some of his prior vitality.After circulating through his body once, the energies eventually nestled into his azure-colored and radiantly shining palace, becoming part of his resonant power.Li Luo felt intoxicated by the rapid growth of his resonant power, and this only contributed to his mad fervor to cultivate even harder. It was a hard-won opportunity that he would not squander.Time unknowingly passed and half a day went by in a blink.When Li Luo finally awoke from his cultivation frenzy, he could faintly feel a tingling, prickling sensation throughout his body.His body was trying to remind him that his cultivation for the day had to come to an end.Progressing energy cultivation arts through the process of absorbing worldly natural energy would inevitably burden the cultivator's body. It was said that the lower the grade, the larger the burden on one's body.Once the body's limit was reached, cultivation would have to temporarily stop. Only after a period of rest would one be able to continue doing so again.Li Luo was precisely at this very point, his body currently at its limit.This sudden interruption led Li Luo to feel a little resigned as he wished to continue. Alas, he had no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the Azureflood Meditation Diagram was a General Stage art, and him persisting for such a long period of time was already something exceptional.One could clearly see the importance of a high-grade energy cultivation art from this result alone.If one was able to start cultivation with a high-grade art, the minor accumulations over the days and months would allow one to travel much further down the path of cultivation than those that did not have one.It was a pity that such high-grade arts were not only rare and precious but also possessed stringent requirements. Just the restrictions on the resonant grade alone would eliminate the vast majority of individuals from cultivating them. Li Luo was also currently part of this majority.Duke resonance arts were available to him... but they all minimally required a seventh-grade resonance.The bright side was that this Azureflood Meditation Diagram was a temporary measure. When Li Luo inevitably upgraded his acquired resonance, he would then start to cultivate even higher grade energy cultivation arts.From this, it could be seen that the quicker he raised his resonance grade, the better it would be.Li Luo yawned and stretched out his arms. He could see a wave of azure resonant power emitting from his palms.This was what he had struggled for.Water resonance power.... At the same time, he also possessed light resonance power.When combined, the two would definitely create a result that was untold times purer than one who only possessed water resonance power.\"My resonant power should have reached the Third Seal Stage,\" Li Luo mused to himself.The old Li Luo had immense difficulty absorbing energy into his blank palace. However, it was not as though he had absolutely no foundations so to speak. After this bout of cultivation, he had firmly stepped into the Third Seal Stage.At the current pace he was going at, Li Luo had confidence that he would reach the Fifth Seal Stage by the end of the week.Although a 4th-grade resonance was not high, Li Luo was the House Luolan's Young Lord! He had a sea of cultivation resources to tap into! His rate of improvement would far surpass the common man, even some of the geniuses!\"Hmm, but this is not enough,\" Li Luo mumbled. The final examination would happen next month, and his aim was to enter the Astral Sage College. The top college of the Xia Kingdom would have exacting standards for entry.Just how many exceptional youths were produced each year? In the end, most of them would be left screaming and struggling at the gates, remaining as part of the rabble.Hence, Li Luo wanted to quickly catch up, and his current pace was insufficient.\"It looks like in the end, the only solution is to temper my resonance. The fourth-grade is too low for my standards!\"Li Luo steeled the resolve in his heart as he got up to leave. The moment he left the library, an attendant who had been waiting greeted him enthusiastically. \"Young Lord! Cai Wei wanted me to notify you that she has already completed her task. All of the goods have been sent to your room.\"At this point, he could only exclaim in joy in his heart. This Cai Wei was truly a capable assistant to Sister Qing'e. Her ability to carry out tasks was truly unrivalled. He had originally expected it to come in tomorrow.Quickly dismissing the attendant, he made haste towards his room.Upon entering, he could see that his table was stacked high with exquisite wooden boxes. Upon opening one of them, one could find several tens of neatly arranged sparkling and translucent crystal bottles.Li Luo curiously picked up two of such crystal bottles. There was a blue liquid within one of them that would give people a penetrating feeling when looked at as it gently swayed within the bottle. A sound much akin to that of a flowing stream could be faintly heard coming from it.The other crystal bottle was filled with an even more curious sight. It seemed to contain strands of flowing light, each one a thin thread. From afar, it even looked like a wisp of smoke.Despite one being a liquid and the other a ray of light, both gave off similar feelings of purity.\"These are spirit liquids and purifying lights? How fascinating.\" Li Luo tutted in amazement. These could only be refined by cultivators with water and light resonances. They were somewhat similar to pills, both essential goods for any cultivator.Li Luo continued to turn the bottle to inspect every corner before he noticed a label on one of them.\"Blue Topaz Spirit Liquid, fourth-grade. Tempering strength: 58%\"Blue Topaz Spirit Liquid was a somewhat common fourth-grade spirit liquid found in the market. On the other hand, the supposed refinement strength was an indication of how much of the spirit liquid would actually be able to temper someone's resonance. The rest would be rejected by the palace. This was hence termed as tempering strength.Simply speaking, the purer the spirit liquids and purifying lights, the stronger the tempering strength, resulting in an even better result.The 58% tempering strength meant that upon usage, 42% would naturally be rejected.58% may not seem very significant, but the truth was that this was more than sufficient. An average fourth-grade spirit liquid or purifying light in the market would have a tempering strength of 56% or so. Anything above that grade would be considered excellent quality, and the price would correspondingly be higher.It was common knowledge that there was a limit to how much one could temper their resonances. The higher the grade of the spirit liquids and purifying lights, the less impurities they would contain. Using a superior product would allow them to delay reaching the point where they could no longer utilize these spirit liquids and purifying lights, while getting a better effect for themselves.Li Luo had a smile on his face as he looked at his little \"cuties\". His natural blank palaces seemed to have become essential at this point. Others would be concerned at not maximizing the efficacy of spirit liquids and purifying lights when using them, concerned with riddling their palaces with impurities, accelerating the point where they could no longer be tempered. These individuals would slowly use these tempering tools over time to mitigate any issues that arose. He, on the other hand... he had absolutely no reservations at all.His natural blank palaces would allow him to squander these spirit liquids and purifying lights with impunity.This was also a test. If he could absorb all fifty spirit liquids and purifying lights, just how far would his fourth-grade resonance be tempered?Just the thought alone caused his heart to beat even quicker.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0013\u2013 Li Luo's Black HolePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith his excited emotions, Li Luo spent the whole night tinkering.When morning arrived, Li Luo rubbed his heavy eyelids whilst sitting in the attic. His gaze was staring expectantly at the wooden boxes before him.About half of the spirit liquids and purifying lights had already been consumed.He realized that he had neglected something important. Even though he had a blank palace and was unconcerned with the impurities, absorbing these treasures required time, and just chugging the whole lot in one go wouldn't work... In fact, this was actually counterproductive as these spirit liquids and purifying lights would interfere with each other.Hence, he was only able to absorb twenty-seven portions.Of course, if anyone else heard of this matter, they would write Li Luo off as a complete madman. No one would ever engage in such debauchery!Twenty-seven spirit liquids and purifying lights in one night? Not only would it result in a massive heap of impurities, the individual's palace would likely be sealed off not too long after!Only people who were at the end of the road would deign to take such a wasteful and insane action.These people would succeed or die trying.\"It seems like the results aren't bad...\" Li Luo's regret over his \"mediocre results\" also naturally dissipated. His gaze brightened when he realized that the glow emanating from his first palace had become purer than before. Even his flowing resonant power seemed to have transformed, becoming even more vigorous and refined.At the rate he was going, Li Luo calculated that he would require another hundred portions of fourth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights to raise his waterlight resonance to the fifth-grade.Upgrading his fourth-grade resonance to the fifth-grade would incur an approximate total cost of two hundred thousand skygold\u2026This sum was honestly something that Li Luo could still bear. However... the likely cost to temper his resonance again after that would be a little... excessive.This was because fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights were multiple times more expensive. Additionally, the amount required to temper his resonance would also undoubtedly increase.By his calculations, raising his resonance from the fifth-grade to the sixth-grade would likely cost him about a million pieces of skygold?And then from the sixth to seventh.... that would be countless millions...?What about after that?The thought of the resources required for Li Luo's tempering caused him to feel a little stifled. Although he wasn't directly managing things, he knew that House Luolan's yearly profits from managing every business was only a few million pieces of skygold.Even if he swallowed up every existing asset that belonged to the house, it would be extremely difficult to raise his resonance to the eighth-grade.This acquired resonance was basically a money-sucking black hole!Unknowingly, Li Luo started massaging his temples...\u00a0Dad and Mom, the house you left behind isn't enough to support this wastrel\u2026\"Though... if I'm able to refine my own spirit liquids and purifying lights, then I would be able to save quite a bit.\" At this very moment, Li Luo thought of his own waterlight resonance. From a certain point of view, this was also his strength. If he was able to develop his talent in it, it was very likely that the spirit liquids and purifying lights which he refined would be the best in the field. It looked like he would have to bring forward his plans to learn the arts of a resonance artificer.\"It looks like Mom and Dad considered this situation in great detail... This is why they wanted me to become a resonance artificer. Otherwise, I might very well be the one who truly destroys House Luolan from the inside...\" Li Luo sighed once again. He truly had to respect his parents' foresight.Li Luo did not continue thinking too much about this issue. In any case, he should just barely have the means to cover the costs of bringing his resonance up to the sixth-grade... He would take things as they came.Hence, he shook his head to clear his mind and retired to his bedroom for some well-deserved rest.For the following two days, he continued to cultivate feverishly day and night. In the day, he would practice his Azureflood Meditation Diagram till he had to stop. After which, he would spend two hours honing his resonance arts. To finish the day off, he would proceed to utilize spirit liquids and purifying lights to temper his resonance.His full fledged efforts bore fruit. His resonant power quickly arose to the Fourth Seal Stage and his fourth-grade waterlight resonance became increasingly purified.It was at this point that Li Luo felt that he was on top of the world. Just what could stop his ascent to the very top?As it turns out, nothing too outlandish.Shortly after, things came to a screeching halt as he exhausted his store of spirit liquids and purifying lights... bringing his great hopes to a temporary pause.......Within the old manor, inside the administrative office.Cai Wei was garbed in a long robe as she sat in front of the table. Her slender body was accentuated by her well-developed assets, which spilled forth from her chest, making her a remarkable sight. Currently, her beautiful, rounded face was filled with a frown as she examined a record before her.\"Manager Gu, don't you think the decrease in the profits from the Tianshu Province is a little severe?\" Cai Wei shifted her gaze from the record to the manager in front of her.The middle-aged man addressed as Manager Gu bitterly smiled as he nodded. \"General Manager is right. House Luolan originally possessed nine stores, eighteen mines, and countless pharmacies... However, because of the instability within the house, the other three houses in the Tianshu Province have redoubled their efforts to swallow up our interests in the past year. \u00a0The Song Family is the largest culprit. Out of the nine stores we own, two of them were suppressed by them. They swallowed these businesses up when we were unable to maintain them.\"Cai Wei's gaze turned frosty after hearing this. House Luolan had built its foundation within the City of Southwind before ascending with utmost speed to become one of the Xia Kingdom's Great Houses.Within the Tianshu Province, there were three other large families which House Luolan had to contend with. When one looked at things from the perspective of the Xia Kingdom, these three families could never have hoped to compare with House Luolan. However, within the Tianshu Province alone, they were old powers with significant influence, deeply rooted and with solid foundations.When the two House Lords were around, House Luolan was like the sun at its zenith. These three families were extremely shrewd and listened to every word from House Luolan. Who would have expected that once the House Lords disappeared, they would immediately contest House Luolan's interests and start to rock the boat?Cai Wei had once heard from Jiang Qing'e that there was most likely an invisible hand behind the curtain guiding these three families. This was a supreme power that was constantly seeking to test House Luolan's bottom line and the truth of their situation.The families in the Tianshu Province were known as the Song family, the Bei family, and the Difa family. The strongest amongst the three being the Song family. This was also the family that acted out the most during these past few years. They would utilize all sorts of means to suppress and to get a piece of House Luolan's businesses.One had to also know that the Song family's head would turn up to offer New Year's greetings each year without fail in the past.This 180-degree change in personality even seemed like an orchestrated play.Cai Wei, on the other hand, was an experienced soul and would not harbor any naive thoughts. House Luolan's existence had previously suppressed the interests of these three families. Now that the house was full of internal strife, having their feet stepped on was not without reason nor was unexpected. This was the price of doing business. Despite this, the situation was not the same as in the past; one had to treat the other party seriously as an enemy to prevent any further issues from arising.However, the current House Luolan was unable to deliver too much assistance to save the fire raging within the Tianshu Province. Every location was under significant amounts of pressure, and with Pei Hao's existence being a constant timebomb... this was truly adding fuel to the existing inferno.With this dilemma on hand, Cai Wei was engrossed in deep thought, trying to figure out the best solution. Eventually, she came to a decision. \"Temporarily shutter all the businesses that are unable to operate. There is no need to tangle with the opponents.\" Knowing when to lie low was a necessity. Once the situation in House Luolan stabilized, these families would be forced to spit out every last bite they had taken.Hearing her decision, the few managers near her immediately acknowledged and proceeded to carry her instructions out. They too understood that the situation of House Luolan within the Tianshu Province was not the most critical thing in the grand scheme of things.Knock, knock.At this point, someone knocked on the door to the office. Cai Wei instructed the knocker to enter, and when the door opened, a certain Li Luo strode right in.The managers immediately greeted him respectfully.Waving his hand to signal he wanted to speak to Cai Wei personally, the group of managers were ordered by Cai Wei to leave the room. Following which, her beautiful eyes affixed themselves on him. \"Young Lord, may I know if there are any problems?\"Li Luo coughed lightly and smiled. \"Indeed. I seem to have run into a little problem which requires Elder Sister Cai Wei's assistance.\"Cai Wei's captivating eyes and willowy eyebrows blinked as she felt that something just didn't seem right. Still, she asked, \"What sort of problem?\"Li Luo, giving his most warm smile, replied without skipping a beat, \"Honestly it's nothing new. Do you remember the fifty sets of spirit liquids and purifying lights? Well, I've sort of finished them all. Could I kindly trouble Elder Sister Cai Wei to assist me with procuring another... hundred sets?\"The expression on Cai Wei's white and smooth egg-shaped face froze up a little. Her beautiful pupils continued to focus on Li Luo as her chest gradually began to heave up and down.\"Another... hundred sets? All fourth-grade?\" Her two palms were currently clenched extremely tightly. Just how long had it been since she started managing the Tianshu Province's finances? Could it be that this was the day they were going to go bankrupt? Was she going to be the sinner of House Luolan, the one responsible for crippling its very foundation?Finally, she could no longer hold back her rampaging emotions, immediately slamming her first down angrily on the table before her, an expression full of fury.\"Li Luo! Are you trying to get me fired?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0014\u2013 A Furious Cai WeiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCai Wei's furious reaction scared the crap out of Li Luo, making him jump backwards in fright. Cautiously, he examined that round face, completely flushed red with anger. Naturally, he felt a little embarrassed as he quickly replied, \"Why would you say such a thing, Elder Sister Cai Wei? Your exceptional abilities speak for themselves. Why would I want to get you fired?\"Cai Wei continued to leer at Li Luo. It was a few good moments before she began to cool down. \"My sincerest apologies, Young Lord. I spoke out of turn, so please forgive me.\" She then paused for a moment.\"However... Young Lord, do you truly need another hundred portions of spirit liquids and purifying lights? This is no small matter. Furthermore, the Young Lord should also know that even though spirit liquids and purifying lights can temper one's resonance, they should not be used wantonly, or they will cause one's resonant palace to be sealed.\" Cai Wei knew of Li Luo's predicament of a blank palace and its sensitive nature, hence she did not wish to directly speak about it, to prevent her from hurting his feelings.She continued to ponder over the situation, then her gaze suddenly turned sharp. \"Could it be that someone is secretly extorting the Young Lord? Are they trying to take advantage of your status to obtain copious amounts of spirit liquids and purifying lights?\" Although every servant within the old manor had been carefully screened, there would inevitably be some who would develop some unfavorable intentions, considering how long his parents had been gone for. Spirit liquids and purifying lights were also precious goods that were often traded, hence this idea that Li Luo was being blackmailed didn't seem too outlandish\u2026If this was the case, Cai Wei would definitely ensure hellfire fell upon that brave soul who dared to even try.Li Luo shook his head and seriously said, \"Elder Sister Cai Wei, there's no need to imagine things. It's just a fact that I require them for my own usage.\"Cai Wei's willowy eyebrows were raised curiously. \"I'd like to apologize for overstepping my bounds... but may I kindly know what the Young Lord is doing with these spirit liquids and purifying lights? I'm not trying to interrogate you Milord, but I am concerned that in your zeal to get stronger, you might have embarked on an incorrect path. If something did happen to you, I wouldn't be able to face Sister Qing'e.\" She knew that Li Luo's blank palace had brought him undue stress and that youths were prone to bull-headed decisions. Her only worry was that Li Luo had been tricked into some sort of snake-oil scam to break through his shackles.Li Luo paused and deliberated for a moment before giving his reply. \"I suppose there's no harm in letting Elder Sister Cai Wei know. My parents had left behind a secret art which allowed me to manifest a resonance of my own. Thus, the reason why I require the spirit liquids and purifying lights should be self-explanatory.\" This was a fact that would eventually come to light. People would definitely be curious as to what had happened. His parents leaving behind a secret method would truly be a great form of cover for the true reasons behind it.He would continue to need to purchase copious amounts of these tempering materials in the future, and these requests would have to run through Cai Wei anyways. It made more sense to quell her concerns immediately.Cai Wei was shocked. \"The two House Lords left behind a secret art?\"This seemed unbelievable, so she remained partially unconvinced. However, as her eyes examined Li Luo, she noticed that he seemed absolutely calm. This didn't seem like a lie.Finally convinced, she nodded in agreement.\"Since this is the case, I will immediately proceed to carry out the Young Lord's instruction.\" Cai Wei softly sighed. These hundred portions of spirit liquids and purifying lights would likely cost hundreds of thousands of skygold. Half of House Luolan's reserves in the Tianshu Province would be exhausted. This would definitely throw a wrench in her plans to contain the three families' covetous actions.However, she knew what her priorities were. Being able to strengthen Li Luo's resonances would also be worth sacrificing all of the businesses within the Tianshu Province.Li Luo glanced at Cai Wei's radiant and round face furrowed with a frown. Slightly embarrassed, he queried, \"Have I caused Elder Sister Cai Wei some trouble due to my requests being too expensive?\" She raised her head to look at him. His sheepish face seemed a little youthful and inexperienced, but he truly had inherited his parents' good looks. Lightly laughing at his expression, her mood lightened up. \"This issue is truly slightly thorny, but it's not a huge problem. Young Lord, you can rest assured that I will settle everything.\" Li Luo sighed with relief in his heart. A hundred portions of these spirit liquids and purifying lights had already caused Cai Wei to be hard-pressed for a solution. He couldn't imagine what would happen in the future if that was the case. This was barely a drop in the bucket...\"Is House Luolan's headquarters unable to mobilize its capital?\" Li Luo asked.Cai Wei lightly nodded before she regretfully said, \"Young Lord, you should be aware of House Luolan's current situation. Adding to the fire was Pei Hao swallowing up three pavilions, which resulted in a third of our profits lost. This has only made matters worse.\" From her words, Li Luo easily read between the lines and knew that the headquarters was unable to assist.Nodding his head, he had no words to say regarding this, so he shifted the topic to more pleasant things. After things were smoothed out, the two parties left.Cai Wei stared at his leaving shadow, slightly lost in thought. This Young Lord didn't have a bad personality, he treated others warmly and without arrogance. Coupled with his good looks and talent, it was only a matter of time before he would resemble his dad, one who managed to captivate the hearts of numerous noble ladies throughout the entire Xia Kingdom.From a certain point of view, he truly was a good match for Jiang Qing'e.The only flaw was his blank palace because ultimately in this world, everything relied on the basis of strength, whether it be wealth or influence.House Luolan was no exception. When Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan were around, they were one of the five Great Houses, especially radiant in the eyes of all. A titan that no one would dare to offend.The moment they disappeared, the radiance gradually dimmed, to the point that even the elements were able to shake them!Jiang Qing'e, on the other hand, had immeasurable talent and a limitless future. She was even poised to break the Xia Kingdom's record for the youngest Duke Stage cultivator. Until now, Li Luo's marriage arrangement was actually just a burden that held her back.For perspective, Cai Wei and Jiang Qing'e were actually bosom buddies who had met in the past, when Jiang Qing'e did not possess the icy personality she was known for today. Hence, she was also concerned for Li Luo as a friend. Especially since it was possible that Li Luo would have crumbled from the pressure of being tied to someone so extraordinary whilst being shunned as a cripple.Yet after she heard Li Luo's words about the House Lords' secret art, she felt a little relieved. Perhaps this could very well satisfy the deficiency in his blank palace, allowing their gap to narrow at least a little.Still, the distance would remain large nevertheless.As Jiang Qing'e's friend and one who often followed her as they traversed the situations of Xia City, she was distinctly aware of where Jiang Qing'e stood in terms of talent and ability. She was the absolute cream of the crop, one that even geniuses had to admire.Compared to that, the City of Southwind was merely just a drop in the ocean.Thinking of the upcoming challenges as a result, Cai Wei forcefully suppressed that roiling feeling in her heart and focused on the task ahead. Signalling for managers to come, she dispatched individuals to accomplish the task assigned to her by Li Luo.Under her supervision, the task was accomplished within half a day. Li Luo sighed in amazement at her ability to get things done as he stared at the two crates before him. Grabbing both of them, he immediately rushed back to his room.Over the remaining few days of leave, Li Luo spent all of his time cultivating and tempering his resonance.He had previously risen from the Third Seal to the Fourth Seal in two days. This was because he had already accumulated the foundation to do so in the past and hence took little time. Moving from the Fourth Seal to the Fifth Seal thus required more time and was a little slower.\"Slower\" here was only in reference to the speed of the previous advancement.When there was one day left of his leave, Li Luo's resonant power finally made a leap and he fully entered the Fifth Seal Stage.In addition to his resonant power rising, his fourth-grade waterlight resonance also finally finished absorbing the last of the spirit liquids and purifying lights, advancing a grade to the fifth-grade.And as such, his leave came to an end.Dawn arrived and he slowly strode out of the old manor. Due to his increased resonant power, even his hair seemed to have gained a new luster, looking slightly silverish. Li Luo had a gleaming smile on his face as he faced the rising sun.This week had truly been life-changing for him, for he had left behind his previous bodily shackles and completely metamorphosed. The youth with the blank palace had now transformed into someone completely new.As he stood in the gateway, he stared at the direction in which Jiang Qing'e had gone a week ago and exhaled deeply.\"Astral Sage College... you will accept me!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it felt like it had been a lifetime since he last stepped within.Taking in the sights, he stared at the numerous people coming and going, the rowdy and cacophonous laughter, and also relished in the youthful vigor everyone exuded.At the same time, he also noticed that within the groups of people were countless curious gazes focused upon him. Unsurprisingly, he started to hear gossip centered around him\u2026\"Isn't that Li Luo? He's finally back to school. About time.\"\"What's wrong with his hair? Did he dye it?\"\"He took a week of leave of absence the month before the final examinations. To do so willingly... perhaps the broken pot has now been completely shattered?\"\"I heard that Li Luo is about to withdraw from the academy entirely... Perhaps he won't even take part in the final examinations.\"\"Really?\"\"...\"Taking in all the random rumors, Li Luo was left speechless. He had just disappeared for a week, but the rumors had only gotten more and more exaggerated!However, he was in no mood to entertain these clowns. He weaved his way past the crowd as he walked towards the Second School.Upon arriving at the entrance to the teaching fields, Li Luo's pace slowed down. This was because he had spotted the teacher of the Second School, Xu Shanyue! He was standing ahead of him, back straight and with the presence of a lofty mountain, severely staring at Li Luo.Li Luo sheepishly let out a smile, redoubling his pace towards him and letting out a friendly greeting. \"Teacher Xu.\"Xu Shanyue continued to glare at Li Luo, slight disappointment seen within his eyes. \"Li Luo, I know your blank palace has brought you a lot of stress. However, you should not be giving up at this last juncture.\"\"I haven't given up\" Li Luo hastily replied in his defence.\"Then why did you take a leave of absence during this critical point?\" Xu Shanyue thundered. \"Everyone has been struggling to make use of every available moment to cultivate and train. You, on the other hand, took a break to rest?\"Li Luo felt a little helpless at his conclusion. Deep down, he also knew that Xu Shanyue had his best interest at heart and thus did not try to defend himself, just gaily nodding at his lecture.After a long tirade, Xu Shanyue eventually ended with a sigh. He gave Li Luo a deep look before turning away to walk into the teaching fields.Li Luo hurriedly followed as they entered the massive teaching fields. In the middle was a platform several tens of meters long surrounded by a circular ring of stone steps, each stacked up high.On top of the stone steps were numerous stone mats.Specifically, there was a particular young lady sitting cross-legged on one of those mats.When Li Luo entered, he was subject to the scrutiny of everyone around, his very appearance provoking numerous whispers.The elusive Li Luo who had disappeared for a week had once again become the hot topic of Southwind Academy.Li Luo disregarded the rancorous gazes and maintained his calm, heading to his assigned stone mat. Beside him sat the massively built Zhao Kuo. Seeing him take a seat, Zhao Kuo asked in surprise, \"What happened to your hair?\"Li Luo gave him a glance before casually replying, \"Just dyed it. Haven't you heard? This is called Granny Grey. Isn't it cool?\"Zhao Kuo was left speechless and his veins bulged at the nonsensical reply, seemingly wanting to ask another question. At this point, Xu Shanyue's loud voice reverberated around the field. \"Good morning, students. The final examination is coming soon and I hope everyone here will redouble their efforts during this final sprint. If you're able to attend an elite college, your future will be limitless.\"I would also like to commend students Zhao Kuo and Yuan Qiu. Both of them have reached the Sixth Seal Stage, and if you two continue striving hard, it's not impossible to reach the Seventh Seal.\" Cheers and applause echoed as the rest congratulated the two. Li Luo, on the other hand, looked over with surprise. It seemed as though he was not the only one who was making improvements.After praising the two, Xu Shanyue continued with the day's lesson.Li Luo focused on the teachings with rapt attention. Today's lesson was regarding three resonance arts, two low-grade ones and one middle-grade one. He elaborated on all of the arts' mysteries patiently, guiding people on their intricacies.Resonance arts were also split into grades similar to energy cultivation arts. The only difference was that entry-level energy cultivation arts were all lumped into one grade, whilst resonance arts were still split into low, middle, and high grades.After these three grades, they followed the nomenclature of General, Duke, and King Stage resonance arts.Of course, such high-level resonant arts were too far off for these individuals who were still at the Ten Seals Stage. Even if they learned them, it might very possibly be impossible to execute these arts with their limited resonant power.Li Luo had always possessed an exceptional affinity and talent towards the learning of resonance arts. If one were to purely compare their understanding and application of resonance arts, he was extremely confident that he would be unrivalled within the entire Southwind Academy, with few being his match.As a result, it was no surprise that he quickly understood and grasped the three resonance arts taught by Xu Shanyue.Two hours later, Xu Shanyue stopped their practice and made some arrangements before allowing them to rest. \"Alright, today's resonant art lesson will come to an end. The afternoon class will be about resonant power, so continue to cultivate quietly.\"Li Luo sat in his original seat, stretching like a lazy cat. Zhao Kuo quickly sidled over and smiled. \"Esteemed Brother Luo, would you kindly give me pointers regarding the three resonance arts taught today?\" Zhao Kuo was very clear as to how gifted Li Luo was when it came to learning resonance arts. Whenever he encountered difficulties with learning these arts, he would inevitably make a beeline towards Li Luo for his assistance.Li Luo playfully scolded him. \"If I guide you, will you continue to refer to me as Esteemed Brother Luo from now on?\"Zhao Kuo grinned mischievously, but the act of that caused him to feel pain from a bruise on his face, resulting in him clenching his teeth almost immediately after.\"What's wrong with you?\" Li Luo asked.Zhao Kuo frowned as he replied, \"It's all because of that scumbag Bei Kun. I don't know why he went mad, but he's been constantly looking for trouble in the Second School. I couldn't take his provocations any longer and thus decided to spar against him.\" At this point, he pointed at a bruise on his face before arrogantly replying, \"That brat didn't pull any punches, but he did not get away unscathed. That gigolo face of his was almost hammered into mush.\" At this point, some other students from the Second School gathered around and complained furiously. \"That Bei Kun is really vicious. We were just minding our own business when he came over to provoke us.\"\"Thankfully, Zhao Kuo stepped in for us; otherwise, no one could have handled him.\"Zhao Kuo waved his hand and waved awat the group who had suddenly appeared before saying to Li Luo in a low voice, \"Did you aggravate that mad man Bei Kun recently? It looks like he has been looking for you.\" Upon hearing that, Li Luo suddenly remembered that before he took his leave of absence, that Bei Kun fellow had indeed asked Difa Qing to pass a message on to him, inviting him to a dinner at Tower Qingfeng. He had originally just shrugged that off as a joke... could it be that that brat had spent an entire day waiting for him?Following which, he didn't turn up to school for a week... It looked as though Bei Kun had decided to come over to vent his frustrations in the Second School\u2026Li Luo smiled and patted Zhao Kuo's shoulder. \"Could be the case. Though it looks like you've already helped me wallop him a couple of times.\"\"I don't mind. If not for those bouts of sparring, I might not have managed to break into the Sixth Seal Stage.\" Zhao Kuo loosened his shoulders at this point before continuing, \"Though now that you're back, I'm sure he will be here to visit you during the afternoon resonant power class.\"Thinking about it, he proudly clapped his chest before announcing, \"If push comes to shove, let me handle it. Perhaps a few more rounds of beating will allow me to break into the Seventh Seal Stage?\" Li Luo laughed. Zhao Kuo was direct and loyal, truly a reliable friend. He had hidden behind his friend for long enough\u2014this just wasn't his personality or style.Hence, he replied mysteriously, \"Let's talk about it when it comes to that.\"......Noon, Resonant Power class.To the north of Southwind Academy was a vast and dense forest. Whenever the wind blew past, a wave of lush greenery would also be uplifted by the drafts.And within the middle of the dense forest was a massive and imposing tree. It was dark yellow in color and was over two hundred meters in height, the dense branches spread out like a net made of wood.The tree branches were thick and sturdy and riddled with leaves. What was most interesting was that each leaf was almost two meters wide and long, as thick as a rule, almost like a mini platform of sorts.This tree was known as the Tree of Resonant Power.The Tree of Resonant Power was not a natural creation but one constructed from numerous rare treasures. This was truly a case of something being more than what meets the eye.Within the Tree of Resonant Power was an energy core. This energy core was able to absorb and store copious amounts of worldly natural energy.The large leaves of the tree were to be used as cultivation dais, each allowing for one student to cultivate on.Owning a Tree of Resonant Power was a foundational requirement for any academy, their strength depending on the might of the academy.From a certain perspective, these tree leaves were similar to Li Luo's family's cultivation room. Of course, if one were to compare efficacy, the skygold room within Li Luo's old manor would be significantly better. Though this was because Li Luo was fortunate and most students did not possess such a wondrous background.The Tree of Resonant Power's leaves were also split into three grades: Gold Leaves, Silver Leaves, and Bronze Leaves.If one were to look from afar, they would notice that 60% of the leaves were Bronze leaves, 30% were Silver Leaves, and only 10% were Gold Leaves.The Gold Leaves were all situated at the top of the tree and were relatively smaller in number.Obviously, being able to cultivate atop a Gold Leaf would inevitably be more advantageous compared to a lesser grade.However, the Gold Leaves were mostly monopolized by the students of the First School. This was inevitable as the students were stronger, and the face of the academy.Hence, when it came to the Second School, there were only 10 Gold Leaves up for grabs, with the Third School and the Fourth School having no chance to even contest for this precious resource. These Gold Leaves were truly in demand.The Tree of Resonant Power was only open for cultivation for half a day. Whenever the clock above the tree rang out, that would mean the start of the cultivation session. This was the most anticipated part of each day for every student.Hence, once the clock rang out, the hordes of students would rush into the dense forest excitedly like a human wave, jubilant looks on their faces. They would ascend the tree via the wooden ladder that snaked around the trunk like a python as quickly as they could.Li Luo followed the mass of people and ascended the tree as well. He stared awkwardly at the 10 Gold Leaves that belonged to the Second School. One used to be reserved for him, but that was back when he was the strongest within the school, bar Zhao Kuo.However, because of his blank palace, he had taken the initiative to give up his slot and thus he no longer had a place. He also felt embarrassed to reclaim the seat he had given away\u2026\"Forget it. Let's just use what I can,\"\u00a0Li Luo thought to himself as he walked towards a Silver Leaf.Just as Li Luo approached the Silver Leaf, a gaze full of mixed expressions from the peak of the tree landed upon him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0016\u2013 Tree of Resonant PowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe top of the Tree of Resonant Power was clustered with numerous large and sturdy branches that were clumped together, forming a wooden platform. A gaze coming from the top of the wooden platform had arced down, staring right at where Li Luo was sitting.\"This Li Luo disappeared for a week and seems to have come back to school.\" Difa Qing had her arms around her waist, her close-fitting school uniform snugly wrapped around her figure. That body combined with her cute, charming face and snow-white skin, it was no surprise she was the object of many youths' affection.She continued to stare at Li Luo's silhouette, lightly pouting her lips. \"Is he trying to avoid Bei Kun and hiding himself away?\"\"It's such a pity. He's\u00a0soooooo\u00a0dreamy and handsome!\" Beside her, a group of her fellow sisters sighed in regret as they ogled at him.\"Hehe, little lass, I can still remember when Li Luo was still in the First School. You were his biggest fangirl!\" another one of them mocked.The girl who had been laughed at had her face turn beet red, quickly retorting, \"Please! It's not like you girls weren't smitten by him as well!\"The gaggle of girls continued to laugh, their gazes possessing a trace of pity. The Li Luo of the past was an untouchable and incomparable existence within the First School. Not only was he handsome, but his comprehension abilities were top tier. To add the cherry on top, he was the scion of House Luolan when it was in its heyday, a house with two dukes, a behemoth unto itself.Looks, talent, and a wonderful background. Just what sort of girl wouldn't fall for him?It was just a pity that with the turning of time, Li Luo's luster had gradually faded. First, his parents had disappeared, and House Luolan took a huge blow as a result. Then he was \"blessed\" with a blank palace, further knocking him off his pedestal.Thus, the once-influential figure of the First School had been relegated to the Second School.At this point, fangirling over him blindly was no longer as appropriate as before.Difa Qing listened to the chattering of her fellow friends before shaking her head in disgust.\u00a0\"Just a group of superficial wenches.\"...Meanwhile, Li Luo had just managed to sit atop a Silver Leaf when he heard a commotion in the vicinity around him. Turning around to look, the dreaded Bei Kun was stomping over towards him, surrounded by a group of his lackeys.Bei Kun was built tall and strong with a fair face. The only thing that detracted from him was his overcast pupils, giving him a gloomy vibe.\"I thought you were never coming back to school, Li Luo.\" Bei Kun stared at Li Luo with a smile that was not a smile.Li Luo batted him a look. He simply couldn't be bothered to answer.His nonchalant attitude infuriated Bei Kun. When House Luolan was at its prime, he would often fawn over Li Luo and be answered with that very same attitude. He wouldn't have dared to do anything then, but what about now? Just who did Li Luo think he was now?\"I spent an entire day waiting for you at Tower Qingfeng. Pray tell, how should we settle this?\" Bei Kun spoke with clenched teeth.\"Hey! Don't blame me if you're dumb. Please keep your stupidity to yourself. What sort of mentally deficient fool would ACTUALLY think that I would go to Tower Qingfeng just because they wanted me to?\"Bei Kun's gloomy eyes seemed to have become even more despondent as he replied, \"The audacity of you. I will let you off if you apologize right now. Otherwise...\"Li Luo waved his hand like shooing a fly. \"Scram.\"The other students who were witnessing this altercation started to laugh. This Bei Kun could be considered a tyrant within Southwind Academy, often finding others to bully. It was a pity for him that Li Luo had not chosen to give in.Bei Kun glared at Li Luo, immediately threatening, \"Such a hardass. Do you dare to spar with me to back up your words?\"Li Luo shook his head. \"Uninterested.\"This Bei Kun was just too dense. The him of the past didn't want to bother with Bei Kun, and nothing had changed since then. If he accepted every provocation, wouldn't he be no different from Bei Kun?Bei Kun gave a cold smile. He did not continue speaking but signalled to his goons. It was as though they had rehearsed their part in a play, immediately announcing, \"Are all the people of the Second School such scaredy cats?\"After which, even more taunts and jibes followed from the group.The people of the Second School who were nearby started to seethe with anger. Unfortunately, Bei Kun's savage reputation preceded him, so most of them did not dare to even let out a squeak.\"Li Luo, you wouldn't want your problem to implicate the entire Second School, would you?\" Bei Kun asked ominously.Obviously, this blockhead was a little scheming, clearly trying to rile the emotions of the other students. These other students may not dare to take the issue up with Bei Kun directly, but they would definitely apply some pressure onto Li Luo to settle things.\"All of you shut up!\" At this very point, a furious roar echoed as Zhao Kuo strode over. Angrily staring at Bei Kun, he challenged him. \"If you want to fight, I'll give you a fight!\"\"It's you!\" Bei Kun frowned.\"It looks like the beating I gave you the last time was insufficient,\" Zhao Kuo retorted. Yet before he could finish his sentence, he was dragged away by Li Luo. \"Why are you messing around with dog poop? Stop degrading yourself,\" Li Luo drawled. At this point, he scowled at Bei Kun and his group of friends before sighing. \"Help me take note of all those that are here. I will get someone to violently teach them a lesson in peaceful coexistence once I go back.\u201d Although House Luolan was still riddled with trouble, it was still one of the five Great Houses of the Xia Kingdom. The old manor had numerous protectors that weren't considered weak. Picking a few cultivators to assist him with minor troubles wouldn't be an issue.The moment the students heard his words, their jaws dropped. Bei Kun's lackeys were also left astonished and bewildered.Could you not do this my brother? We are just kids playing around! Why would you escalate matters and bring out the big guns!?This didn't seem very logical!The group faced each other nervously before taking a few steps back. Their taunts immediately died down as they knew that Li Luo indeed possessed the power to do so.He might have a blank palace, but he was still House Luolan's Young Lord. Getting a few expert resonance cultivators to bring the beatdown would be as easy as breathing.Bei Kun was also shocked at the series of events. Composing himself, he started to scold, \"How shamless of you! To use such underhanded methods!\"Li Luo frowned. \"If you aren't happy, then dispatch your Bei family's experts. Fight me!\"Bei Kun's jaw dropped and he was left speechless. House Luolan might be filled with internal turmoil, but a skinny camel was still larger than a horse. Before the house actually fractured to pieces, the Bei family could only sneakily take a few bites. In terms of the experts from his family, he wasn't even sure if he could mobilize them! Even if he could, would they dare to take Li Luo on? He wouldn't be able to bear such a result.Thus, a sudden silence descended upon the field, the situation slightly chaotic\u2026...At the absolute peak of the Tree of Resonant Power was a treehouse. Within the treehouse could be seen several individuals quietly observing the students squabbling.\"Keke. This brat from House Luolan is a little interesting.\" An old man with a head of white hair, dressed entirely in black and white, chuckled.This old man was the dean of Southwind Academy. He was known as Wei Sha, and he had an illustrious reputation within the Tianshu Province.\"Threatening to bring in his family's might to deal with childish arguments isn't interesting. How could the two house lords of House Luolan have given birth to such a hoodlum?\" another voice said.This came from a skinny male. Although he exuded a refined and cultured demeanor, his face contained an uninhibited expression of arrogance.This was the teacher of the First School, Lin FengHe was one of the teachers who had proposed for Li Luo to be kicked out of the First School and sent to the Second School.\"Teacher Lin Feng speaks a little too crudely. That Bei Kun clearly knows that Li Luo has a blank palace, yet he still goes to find trouble for him. Truly a person of poor character,\" Xu Shanyue, who was standing beside them, retorted savagely.Lin Feng emotionlessly replied, \"Troubles between students should be settled between themselves. Why the need to escalate the situation?\"Still, he was uninterested in continuing to argue with Xu Shanyue over this small matter. He turned his gaze towards the dean beside him. \"More importantly, do you remember what I previously suggested? Do you agree with what I've said?\"Dean Wei turned and blinked at him. \"What suggestion?\"Lin Feng seemed a little helpless before he answered, \"The final examination is about to arrive. Our First School does not have enough Golden Leaves, and we would like to request for another five Gold Leaves to be provided to our First School.\"\"I disagree!\" The one who raised the objection was Xu Shanyue. He furiously glowered at Lin Feng. Only the First and Second Schools had access to Gold Leaves, and the Second School only had ten. If five were given, where else would they come from? Clearly, the Second School!This chap was truly overreaching his boundaries.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0017\u2013 Fighting for Gold LeavesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAn argument ensued atop the lofty and majestic Tree of Resonant Power. The two teachers of the First and Second Schools were butting heads over the distribution of Gold Leaves.\"Xu Shanyue, you need to understand that our First School has numerous outstanding students as a hotbed of talent. Their abilities far surpass those of the other schools, and if we were to provide better conditions, they would naturally develop even better results. They would also make better use of the resources and be able to leapfrog ahead,\" Lin Feng said in a deep tone.Xu Shanyue coldly retorted, \"It might be true that the First School is exceptional, but that doesn't mean that my Second School is trash. Does that mean that they should not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of these Gold Leaves? Plus, the Tree of Resonant Power has fifty Gold Leaves. Your First School already monopolizes forty of them. How is that not enough?\"Lin Feng frowned. \"The issue isn't whether it's enough or not. It's simply about who can make best use of the resources. The students of the First School are better able to take advantage of the Gold Leaves. I'm not trying to target your Second School, but it's just the truth of the matter.\"Xu Shanyue gave a cold smile. \"You are simply trying to monopolize all of Southwind Academy's resources, all to allow just a few more of your students to enter the Astral Sage College, all for the sake of your own ego and reputation! You're just trying to get yourself into the Astral Sage College the way I see it.\"The truth was that the Astral Sage College was not just the aim of students. Even the numerous academies' teachers treated it as their holy land. All of their efforts were directed to their goals of teaching within the Astral Sage College. This would bring them great stature and an improvement in social status.Having such a goal wasn't a bad thing. However, Xu Shanyue felt that Lin Feng was being too utilitarian, only focusing on his own goals and benefits. Even the act of kicking Li Luo to the Second School wasn't necessary. Li Luo wasn't a bad student, he merely had a blank palace and wasn't even a hindrance.The only reason he had done so was to prove his might, to show the First School that he, who had just joined at that point, was not to be trifled with.As Lin Feng took in those scathing words, his expression changed for the worse. \"Xu Shanyue, don't be an irritating troublemaker.\"The rest of the teachers of Southwind Academy tried to calm the two down at this point as they continued to trade verbal barbs to prevent the situation from worsening.Dean Wei Sha was also left with quite a headache. The Gold Leaves of the Tree of Resonant Power were limited to begin with, and every school wanted more. This was to be expected as it would provide more opportunities for their students to develop their potential. It also affected their rankings and possible promotions.Lin Feng had been pestering him for quite a while by now, and he had always chosen to buy more time. In the end, it seemed that a decision was in order today.Wei Sha stared at the numerous shadows below and then gave a command with his deep and resonant voice. \"The Second School's Gold Leaves cannot be given away without reason. The fact that the First School is more illustrious is not a good reason to deprive those of the Second School the opportunity to develop.\"If you wish to compete for Gold Leaves, then leave it to the students to fight for it themselves.\"Let's do it this way. The First School and the Second School will both pick three students, none of them exceeding the Sixth Seal Stage. Both parties will compete against each other. If the First School wins, then the Second School will give up five Gold Leaves. If the Second School wins, the First School will give up ten Gold Leaves.\" \u00a0Immediately after speaking, Lin Feng and Xu Shanyue both stopped arguing, their brows furrowed in deep thought.\"Dean Wei, could you kindly explain why the First School would have to give up ten Gold Leaves if they lose?\" Lin Feng asked in a dissatisfied tone.Wei Sha smiled. \"That is because this entire situation was raised by you. Furthermore, the First School is stronger and hence has to pay a larger price. What else would give the Second School the incentive to challenge you?\"Lin Feng remained unconvinced, but after thinking things through, he replied in the affirmative.This competition may have been restricted to the Sixth Seal Stage, but his First School did have the advantage here.Xu Shanyue was a little hesitant. Even though the First School would lose ten Gold Leaves, he understood that the First School was the shining star of Southwind Academy. Their students were also head and shoulders above the ones of his school.\"Dean Wei, our Second School only has two individuals who have reached the Sixth Seal Stage,\" Xu Shanyue said helplessly.Lin Feng smiled. \"You can rest assured. The students of the First School won't give you a chance to reach that tiebreaker match.\"Xu Shanyue's face turned black and his gaze seethed with fury.The old dean sighed and said, \"Don't worry so much, Little Xu. If you lose, I will compensate Second School next year. This arrangement will only last for this month.\" After hearing Dean Wei's explanation, Xu Shanyue paused to consider the situation, eventually begrudgingly nodding in agreement. It seemed that in the dean's heart, the students of First School did possess a slightly greater stature than those of the Second School.Xu Shanyue knew that he couldn't fault the dean for this. This was just human nature. If he didn't favor the First School, then what else would he do? Favor the Second School?\"I will go and make the necessary arrangements.\" When Xu Shanyue finished speaking, he immediately vaulted down from atop the treehouse.Lin Feng's face was full of smiles as he also went to find his students....Meanwhile, going back to the students...Bei Kun led his lackeys away while cutting a sorry figure, completely unreconciled with how things had turned out. What was worse was that Li Luo had completely disregarded him and his anger, opting to utilize unorthodox means to deal with him... This had turned into a truly headache-inducing situation.Youths were hot-headed! Disagreements between them should be resolved with fists! Even if one was left with a bleeding head, they ought to clench their fists and just keep struggling! Who could be so shameless as to call their family thugs on a whim to settle these petty grievances?Completely shameless!Seeing the group of goons run off, the students of the Second School stared at Li Luo with strange expressions. They had never expected for him to bring out such a method to deal with the provocations.\"You... This... Don't you think that was a little shameless?\" Zhao Kuo couldn't find the right words as he scratched his head, speaking in a low tone.Li Luo lazily gave him a look. \"If they wanted to bully me for having a blank palace, can I not do the same to them? An eye for an eye!\"\"Well, that's not what I mean...\" Zhao Kuo wanted to retort but couldn't put his thoughts into words, only shaking his head. This young lord was truly a little unruly.As they spoke, Xu Shanyue appeared in front of the students of the Second School. He clapped his hands, signalling for all of the students to gather. Following which, he quickly explained the situation.When the students heard his words, they were incensed!\"This First School has gone too far! They've already taken forty Gold Leaves and they still aren't satisfied? Even going so far as to snatch ours?\"\"There's no chance in this fight. Our Second School only has two who have reached the Sixth Seal Stage...\"\"Hai! Why don't we give up...?\"\"...\"After a brief period of fury, the mood became quite pessimistic. They understood the gravity of the situation, and even if they did manage to scrounge up another Sixth Seal combatant, they would still be at a relative disadvantage.Seeing the disappointed gazes of the Second School students, Xu Shanyue helplessly sighed before deciding. \"Zhao Kuo and Yuan Qiu, the two of you will be selected.\"\"I won't let you down, Teacher. I will definitely not bring shame to the Second School; I will let them know that the Second School isn't so easily challenged!\" Zhao Kuo bellowed, demonstrating his intent to battle and his hotbloodedness.Yuan Qiu was a tall and willowy young lady. Her expression was calm as she asked, \"Who's the third?\"Xu Shanyue's eyes swept across the group of students. All who met his eyes immediately dodged and hid. No one had the confidence to stand upon the stage.In the end, he could only look at Li Luo. He might have a blank palace, but he was an expert in resonance arts. When it came to absolute combat strength, he was almost a match for Zhao Kuo and Yuan Qiu, making him a decent candidate.\"Alright, the last one will be Li Luo.\" Xu Shanyue made his decision. \"Don't feel pressured, and losing doesn't matter. You will be the first one up, just do your best. Once you can't hold on, you can give up. This way, you should be able to attrite the opponent's resonant power, giving the others after you a better chance.\"Being chosen didn't really mean much to Li Luo. Furthermore, the Second School only had so many students who could fight.Clearly, Xu Shanyue's intention was for him to be cannon fodder, to deplete the opponents' resonant power.Li Luo's gaze seemed to have become more complicated. He had originally wanted to keep a low profile, but it looked like the heavens wouldn't permit it. In that case, it was truly time for the hero to showcase his exceptional hidden abilities!Old Xu, you clearly don't understand what sort of existence you've picked for this role...There could truly be no one more fitting for such a critical task...Your bright ideas might lead to your face becoming even more resplendent than the sun when he impresses everyone with his\u2026Pa!Xu Shanyue slapped Li Luo on the shoulder, causing him to stumble. \"Why are you standing there in a daze? Are you scared out of your wits?\"All of the cool, brooding hero momentum that he had gathered up for the stage... had been ruined by that one slap. Almost causing him to fall face first...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0018\u2013 Revealing TalentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe news of the First School competing against the Second School for their Gold Leaves spread. In the blink of an eye, the entire Southwind Academy had congregated amongst the upper levels of the Tree of Resonant Power, all to participate in the excitement.Southwind Academy had four schools. The First School was the most illustrious, the Second School could be seen as the reserves. When it came to the Third and Fourth Schools, saying that they existed to make up the numbers would be a slight exaggeration, but the truth was that they were of a lower standard.To those students, the Gold Leaves of the Tree of Resonant Power were something that they could only see but not touch. Just watching the First and Second Schools duking it would be good enough.Almost no one believed that the Second School could win.On the eastern side of the Tree of Resonant Power was a flat area that consisted of numerous massive and sturdy branches coiled together. These tightly weaved branches formed a vast, wooden platform tens of meters long. It often served as an area for students to exchange pointers after cultivation and to compete against each other.Right at this moment, the four sides were squeezed full of people eager to watch the oncoming fight.The First School and the Second School naturally found their respective places on the east and west of the platform. The mood differed significantly on each. The students on the side of the First School were full of raucous smiles and laughter. It was clear that they weren't really treating this battle as anything important. This was to be expected considering that there were limitations to the resonant power stage for this competition. When it came to talent, Sixth Seal resonant masters could not even place within the top ten.This meant that the true experts of First School would not even have a hand in this.In comparison to the First School, the atmosphere in the Second School was full of unease and anger. They were all from the same academy and had a good understanding of their standing within it. Even the thought of victory was something they did not believe in. Crucially, they were only hoping to not lose in a humiliating fashion\u2026\"This is meaningless. What's the point of such a battle?\" Difa Qing lazily stretched, her beautiful curves accentuated by the school uniform. Even her fellow female schoolmates could only stare at her in envy, while some hot-blooded guys were boiling with emotion at this sight.The fact that Difa Qing was considered one of the golden flowers within Southwind Academy was not a title in jest.\"Well, this can definitely kill some time.\" A gentle voice wafted over. Turning her head to look over, she saw another lady walking over. She had a head of long, black hair, elegant features, and an icy, jade-like complexion. This new entrant was known as Lu Qing'er\"Elder Sister Qing'er.\" Difa Qing's eyes brightened up at this sight, immediately waving at her. Lu Qing'er was even more famous than her and more importantly, she was someone who did not rely on appearances, but on her strength. She easily suppressed numerous geniuses within the First School.She was the poster child for First School with her looks and abilities.Many felt that Lu Qing'er would have become a legend within Southwind Academy if not for the fact that she had been overshadowed by Jiang Qing'e's radiance.Hence, if Difa Qing's number one idol was Jiang Qing'e, Lu Qing'er was second.These two goddesses were Southwind Academy's most exceptional beauties. Now that they were sitting together, they created a soul-stirring scene for all those who glanced at them. Gradually, people started to gather around them.\"Doesn't Elder Sister Qing'er deign to participate in such affairs normally?\" Difa Qing asked curiously.With a slight smile, she replied, \"I'm just here to have a casual look.\"Her beautiful eyes were focused in the direction of the Second School before she continued, \"You mentioned that the Second School will dispatch three fighters?\"Difa Qing replied, unperturbed, \"The Second School only has Zhao Kuo and Yuan Qiu who have reached the Sixth Seal Stage. Plus, they've only just reached that point.\"\"Who is the third one, then?\" Lu Qing'er asked.Difa Qing paused for a bit, unsure of how to reply. Instead, someone in the crowd spoke up. \"It's most likely going to be Li Luo. He may have a blank palace, but his resonance arts are the best. If one were to stretch it, he could barely compete against Fifth Seal Stage cultivators.\"With Lu Qing'er's appearance, some of the most elite students of the First School who were previously uninterested in the competition had muddled over. The one who spoke was a heroic-looking and tall youth.Difa Qing batted him an eye and ridiculed him. \"So it's you, Song Yunfeng. Seems like you've decided to participate in the festivities. What sort of ulterior motives do you have?\" Song Yunfeng was also exceptionally famous within Southwind Academy. In terms of strength, he was on par with Lu Qing'er. Furthermore, he came from the Song Family, one of the three largest families in the Tianshu Province.Him liking Lu Qing'er was not a secret, and he had never tried to hide it.Facing Difa Qing's inquisitive questions, he gave a warm smile and did not retort. Instead, his gaze fell upon Lu Qing'er's beautiful and elegant face.Even in the face of his passionate gaze, Lu Qing'er's expression was unchanging. She merely politely returned it with a greeting smile.Seeing Lu Qing'er's passive response, Difa Qing immediately steered the conversation back to where it was originally. \"If the Second School dispatches Li Luo, it's just courting humiliation. The three Sixth Seal cultivators our First School has picked are well renowned.\"Song Yunfeng smiled and got straight to the point. \"Do you still think the Second School bears any hope of winning? They are just here to parade around.\"\"You're probably right.\" Difa Qing laughed lightly.Lu Qing'er, on the other hand, was looking towards the field, staring at Li Luo's silhouette. For some reason, she could feel that the Li Luo here today didn't seem the same as before.Suddenly, she interjected with a little smile. \"I feel that... that may not be the case.\"Once she spoke, Difa Qing, Song Yunfeng, and all the other students of the First School were a little taken aback.Song Yunfeng followed Lu Qing'er's gaze and also noticed Li Luo. Seeing her faintly smiling at Li Luo brought a sense of unease to his heart.\"Qing'er, this is no longer the past,\" Song Yunfeng pointed out with good intentions.Yet she did not reply, a non-committal smile on her face. On the other hand, Song Yunfeng felt absolutely furious deep down upon seeing that smile, similarly hatefully glancing towards Li Luo with a cold expression on his face.This scumbag had already fallen into the dumps; why did his influence still linger on like some sort of undeparted spirit?Amidst the rising fervor of the audience, the three contestants from the Second School walked up. Unsurprisingly, they were Li Luo, Zhao Kuo, and Yuan Qiu.Three from the First School also made their way forward.One of them was the recently-met Bei Kun. The other two were also particularly famous individuals at the Sixth Seal Stage.\"So what do you plan to do now, Li Luo? Will you just continue to spout threats?\" Bei Kun stared daggers at Li Luo, a sarcastic grin hanging on his face.He had first brought people to find trouble for Li Luo, only to be repelled by Li Luo's shameless tactics. At least right now, Li Luo could no longer do so. This was a true competition of might. If he dared to bring up the threats he had previously made, he would only bring scorn and humiliation upon himself. Even the academy would punish him in the spirit of fairness.Li Luo did not bother with him but instead waved to Zhao Kuo and Yuan Qiu. \"Well, I will head up first.\"Zhao Kuo hurriedly said, \"Be careful! If you can't take it, just give up. It would be too great a loss if your handsome face were ruined.\"Li Luo replied with a thumbs up. \"Brother has foresight!\"Yuan Qiu could only lightly sigh, a listless expression on her face. It was clear that she did not have the confidence her fellow teammates had.Under the scrutiny of the crowd, Li Luo entered the stage before picking a metal staff from the weapons rack, dragging it along the floor. This action caused the staff to scratch against the platform, causing ear-grating and piercing sounds.On the other hand, the audience, seeing that Li Luo had taken the initiative to go up first, erupted into an uproar.\"The Second School intends for Li Luo to be the vanguard...\"\"They want him to be cannon fodder.\"\"Haha, this is interesting. Li Luo was kicked out of the First School and now he's going to fight them... If he manages to win, that would make for an interesting sight!\"\"What are you dreaming about... He's a natural blank palace. Even if he has amazing resonance arts, how can he possibly beat someone at the Sixth Seal?\"\"Haha, I'm just joking. I'm trying to liven up the atmosphere.\"\"...\"Li Luo's appearance had incited a lot of interest and discussion amongst the audience. He was also somewhat of a legend within Southwind Academy...Most importantly, it was rumored that Jiang Qing'e had returned to the City of Southwind last week, even picking him up from school. This very action incited both envy and massive hatred from everyone around.With this in mind, everyone was hoping that Li Luo would receive a walloping...Bei Kun's arms were crossed, a playful look in his eye as he looked at Li Luo. Following which, he turned and spoke to the other two behind him. \"Toy with him a bit, Liu Yang.\" Although he truly wanted to have a bout with Li Luo, he felt that this stage wasn't grand enough. Hence, he wanted to let the others build up the excitement.The youth known as Liu Yang was tall and large. He felt a little dissatisfied at Bei Kun's words. The audience here was large and he wanted to properly showcase his talents. Instead, he was being dispatched to handle the cannon fodder... truly a loss of face.Bei Kun, noticing his dissatisfaction, said dryly, \"If you take him out in a move or two, can't you just continue to take on the next opponent? If you're hardy enough, you might even be able to sweep all three of them.\"\"True...\" Liu Yang nodded. He similarly casually walked up the stage, picking up a metal spear along the way. \"Li Luo. Please have mercy on me,\" he joked.Li Luo grasped his metal staff, his expression unchanging as he faced him.At this moment, at a point high above the stage, the old dean nodded. Xu Shanyue and Lin Feng saw the signal and both exclaimed, \"Begin!\"Once the words resounded, Liu Yang and Li Luo shot towards each other.Whilst they approached each other, Liu Yang stared at that opposing shadow and couldn't help but to give a large guffaw. \"Your speed is a little...\"Peng!Just as he was about to speak, Li Luo, who was in front of him, executed a quick footwork.His toes suddenly pushed off against the ground, sending his entire body soaring forth like an eagle. In the blink of an eye, a cloud of dust was created behind him.Liu Yang's laughter could barely escape his mouth before Li Luo executed a quick maneuver, appearing directly in front of him.But it wasn't just Li Luo that appeared in front of him, there was a metal staff splitting the air, screaming towards him with utmost speed. Liu Yang had virtually no time to react, but through his own conditioned reflexes, managed to summon some resonant power to protect his chest.Li Luo's sudden increase in speed had frightened everyone. He did not have resonant power and limited strength as a result, but so long as Li Liu Yang circulated his resonant power to defend against his move, he would be able to counter attack and make Li Luo pay a price for his actions.As Liu Yang was thinking of that, the metal staff, akin to a black python, smashed downwards onto his chest.Peng!When that dull thud resonated, grievous pain flooded through Liu Yang's chest. Horror surged through him at this moment as the resonant power circulating through his chest was smashed apart by Li Luo's blow!After which, he was sent flying, heavily crashing out of the stage, leaving behind a trail on the ground.The crowd turned silent as everyone attempted to register what had just happened. Immediately after, exhilarated cheers could be heard from everyone!The students of the First School were blankly staring at the pain-wracked Liu Yang, who had been batted out of the stage like a pinball, all at a complete loss.Just what had happened?Why was the one sent flying not Li Luo?Some of them even doubted their eyes, looking towards the stage. Li Luo, on the other hand, was still in the same stance which he had struck Liu Yang in, gracefully looking at Liu Yang below. He seemed so cool at this moment that even his ashamed opponents had a look of idolatry on their faces.\"What were you going to say? My speed is a little what?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone was shocked, eyes wide and mouths agape at Liu Yang, who had been sent flying.This ending had exceeded all expectations.The Sixth Seal Liu Yang had been swatted away like a fly by Li Luo?How could this be possible?!The silence only lasted for a few breaths before the entire crowd exploded once again to newfound excitement!\"What happened?\"\"How did Liu Yang get beaten in a single blow?\"\"This doesn't seem right. Liu Yang is a Sixth Seal Stage cultivator. Even if he couldn't physically react in time, his resonant power should have protected him. How could Li Luo have broken through that?\"\"This Liu Yang couldn't have fixed the match, could he?\"\"Don't you think this is too exaggerated and fake-looking if he wanted to trick us?\"In the First School's direction, Difa Qing's little, red mouth was also hanging wide open. A single question floated up to the top of her head before she frowned and spoke out. \"What is that fool Liu Yang doing? Isn't this too weak a showing?\" Song Yunfeng was also deep in thought as he replied coolly, \"He must have underestimated his opponent. Thus, he did not even have the time to circulate his resonant power.\"\"How stupid of him.\" Difa Qing shook her head.\"Well, I'm afraid Li Luo won't be so lucky next time.\"Lu Qing'er continued to stare at the tall and slender figure wielding the metal staff on the stage. She seemed to be in a trance as she could vaguely remember a time within the First School where this man's heroic momentum had swept across her, making fun of her subpar resonance arts, yet slowly guiding and teaching her.\"Next time...\" Lu Qing'er murmured, \"I'm afraid he will continue to win. In fact, he might very well sweep all of the competitors by himself.\"Once she spoke, numerous experts of the First School were left blankly staring at each other, wondering what sort of spell she had fallen under. In fact, some felt extremely indignant and jealous of Li Luo due to those words.\"It's impossible no matter how you see it. Why are you overestimating him? Are you interested in him?\" Someone from the group piped up.When Song Yunfeng heard those words, he thundered out, \"Who dares spread these false words?\" His gaze swept across the group and everyone shrunk back, none daring to challenge him.Following which, he turned to look at the completely nonchalant Lu Qing'er, indifferently saying, \"Qing'er, he can't do it.\"......\"Li Luo! That was beautiful!\" Whilst the First School was still in shock, Zhao Kuo was the very first one to scream enthusiastically. Even the Second School seemed to have cheered up a little as they celebrated.Whether or not it was Liu Yang underestimating Li Luo, none of it mattered. The Second School had won the first round.The surrounding uproar had caused Liu Yang's expression to turn white. He painfully scrambled to sit himself up before mouthing a few conciliatory words. \"It was my mistake and I didn't dodge his move.\" But no one paid him any attention.\"Idiot.\" Hearing the Second School's cheers, Bei Kun's expression became ugly to behold. He furiously scowled at the pale and crumpled heap known as Liu Yang on the floor before ordering the person beside him to act. \"It's your turn, Lu Tai. Be careful and don't mess around, we can't lose.\"The one known as Lu Tai was a little scrawny, but he gave off a sense of shrewdness. He did not speak much but carefully scrutinized Li Luo before grabbing a sword and entering the stage.Meanwhile, above the stage, Xu Shanyue was all smiles as he spoke words of praise. \"Li Luo's resonance arts have been practiced to the point of perfection. It's a pity that he has that issue with his resonant palace. Otherwise, if his resonant power had reached the Fifth Seal Stage, he would easily be able to dispatch the majority of Sixth Seal opponents.\"Lin Feng's expression was still calm as he replied, \"Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be of much use.\"Let the second round begin!\"It was clear that despite his indifferent expression, Liu Yang's massive defeat had displeased him. Thus, he could not be bothered to bicker with Xu Shanyue, so he directly started the next round.Once the command was made, Lu Tai immediately summoned his resonant power, and a fiery, red resonant power surged from him. A thin flame coated him, radiating sweltering heat.This was Lu Tai's fifth-grade fire resonance.After learning from Liu Yang's mistake, Lu Tai would not underestimate his opponent again.Peng!His fire resonant power continued to rise in intensity as he wielded his longsword. Without a moment of hesitation, he swiftly dashed forward, his sword wreathed with a wave of flickering crimson-red energy, like a blade made out of flame.Shua! Shua!Countless red sword shadows slashed directly towards Li Luo.\"No matter what sort of aberrant you are, Li Luo, my Sixth Seal resonant power will absolutely suppress you! Your defeat is certain!\" Lu Tai gloated loudly.Li Luo's application of resonance arts was spectacular, and this was not a secret. However, even the most amazing of resonance arts was no different from a house of cards if it was not controlled by a strong resonant power. It looked impressive but would fall apart with a gentle touch.The sweltering sword winds arced over whilst Li Luo continued to tightly wield his weapon, immediately retreating nimbly, attempting to dodge as many of the blows as possible.\"Do you think you can dodge them all?\" Lu Tai gave a cold smile as he flicked his wrist. The crimson light around him surged in intensity and then numerous flaming sword shadows materialized and began falling upon Li Luo's vicinity. It was like a firestorm descending, a splendid combination of beauty and danger.This was a middle-grade resonance art known as Firestorm Sword, also Lu Tai's most proficient resonance art.As numerous flaming sword lights shot towards Li Luo, he began to rotate his weapon in front of him, much like a windmill, forming a sort of absolutely impregnable defensive barrier against the attacks.\"Without resonant power, how do you think you can stop me?!\" Lu Tai exclaimed when he saw Li Luo's move.Peng! Peng!Numerous flaming sword lights had been completely deflected by the windmill barrier, but the heat could not be dissipated completely. The metal staff in Li Luo's hands gradually got hotter and hotter, but at this point, blue light seemed to have emerged from within the staff!Weng, weng!Vapor wafted upwards and obstructed Lu Tai's field of visionShu!But at this very moment, the steam blocking his view was torn apart. All one could see was a flash and an azure light-coated metal staff piercing outwards, much like a lightning bolt, directly flying towards Lu Tai's forehead.The sudden attack caught Lu Tai off guard. Had his prized resonance art been blocked by Li Luo?That was impossible!His heart was filled with disbelief and shock, but his hands were not slow to react. Massive amounts of red resonant power blazed from his longsword as he summoned all of his might to directly collide against that explosive metal staff.Dang!The sound of metal clashing reverberated around the stage.What was most shocking was that under such a collision, Lu Tai's crimson-red resonant power seemed to have been massively suppressed, almost completely winking out in an instant.Peng!The sword had been subject to an immense change of temperature from hot to cold, causing it to shatter, its shards flying in every direction. The azure light-coated rod paused right as it touched Lu Tai's forehead.Feeling a piercing pain where he was struck, Lu Tai's face turned pale.This entire clash had lasted as long as a piece of flint setting off a spark. By the time the audience had noticed, Li Luo's staff was already positioned right on Lu Tai's forehead.Li Luo had won again?The last round was a surprise for the audience, and some might have even called it a fluke. This victory, on the other hand, was a clear demonstration of his might.Lu Tai had not underestimated the opponent and had brought out the full measure of his Sixth Seal strength. Yet the fact was that he had been beaten by Li Luo.What was happening!?Under the unbelieving gazes of the audience, the water vapor and smoke emitting from the staff eventually ceased. Li Luo's silhouette could be seen clearly in everyone's eyesHiss!The final hiss of the water evaporating off the staff could be heard amidst the absolute calm amongst the audience, just before everyone started applauding and shrieking.On the side of the First School, Difa Qing and Lu Qing'er's gazes were fixated on the scene. Song Yunfeng, on the other hand, was so frustrated that he slammed his palm against the wooden branches, directly causing a few cracks.Meanwhile, above the stage, Xu Shanyue and Lin Feng had a trace of astonishment on both their faces.Even the old dean was squinting as he tried to take in the truth of what had happened.What they had seen was that Li Luo's body was faintly emitting blue resonant power, each pulse creating numerous waves, much like the sea.They could tell at a glance that this was water resonance power.The thing was that everyone knew that Li Luo possessed a blank palace. It was extremely difficult for him to cultivate resonant power.But what they clearly saw was water resonance power! Where did this come from?Did that mean that the current Li Luo was not a blank palace, but instead possessed a water resonance?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These few brief moments had demonstrated that he was far superior to Lu Tai, quickly bringing about his defeat. Everyone stared in shock at the scene before them, their hearts tumbling with massive unrest, the very sight before them leading them to tremble.\"He... how did he suddenly get a water resonance out of nowhere?\" Difa Qing asked softly.She stared at the tall and exceptionally handsome youth standing in the middle of the platform, victoriously holding onto his weapon. For a brief moment, she slipped into her memories and remembered the Li Luo of the past who had just entered Southwind Academy. At that point, he was the undefeated and influential champion of the academy, his time in the limelight even on par with Jiang Qing'e's.However, with the manifestation of his blank palace, he had fallen from grace, eventually even being relegated to the Second School.The youth who now heroically stood in front of the audience with blue resonant power swirling from him seemed to look exactly how he did in the past, the two images in her mind overlapping, gradually becoming more and more dazzling.Song Yunfeng's change in expression was most wondrous. He was absolutely fixated upon the Li Luo before him, as though he wanted to see through every aspect of him.There was no one else who dreaded seeing such a scene as much as Song Yunfeng did.He bore witness to the radiance and might of Li Luo at his prime and had no intentions of seeing Li Luo ascend again.Quietly, he tilted his head to see how Lu Qing'er would react. She was absolutely starstruck and enthralled by the youth's blooming splendor. The very sight caused him to furiously clench his fist, a deep look in his eyes full of gloominess.Whilst her two companions were feeling complete turmoil, Lu Qing'er was on the other hand very calm, her crystal-clear gaze focusing on Li Luo.\"Could it be...\"\"Southwind Academy is becoming interesting.\"\"Are you going to come back, Li Luo?\"\"What is going on? How did Li Luo suddenly gain a water resonance?\" Lin Feng uttered accidentally. He was absolutely flabbergasted as he looked down from above the stage.\"Did he utilize some sort of corrupt forbidden art?\"Xu Shanyue was equally shocked, but when he heard Lin Feng's rude statements, he retorted, \"What sort of crap are you spouting? Just because Li Luo had a blank palace, that doesn't necessarily mean that will always be the case.\"Lin Feng sluggishly replied with a frown, \"That was not my intention. However, I've always understood that blank palaces were naturally endowed. How could one obtain a resonance after that?\"Xu Shanyue coldly snorted. \"Obviously, we think it's unbelievable because we haven't experienced enough.\"Lin Feng was about to rebut when the old dean spoke out. \"Acquired resonances that are not manifested at birth may be rare, but they are not impossible to come by. It is said in legends that there are certain natural treasures that possess such miraculous effects.\"\"Li Luo's parents must have left behind something like that to allow him to manifest a water resonance.\"\"There's no rush in discussing this matter. Once the competition is over, we can ask him ourselves. We are an academy, we exist to guide and teach. Everything else is not our responsibility.\" Hearing the old dean's words, Lin Feng was left absolutely speechless. He continued to stare at Li Luo, a glint within his eyes, his thoughts unknown.Under the stunned looks of the audience, Bei Kun walked up the stage with a spear and an ugly scowl.\"Li Luo, I never thought you would be hiding your strength so deeply. Are you trying to beat all three of us consecutively to prove yourself? I won't let things go your way,\" Bei Kun said coldly.Li Luo laughed. \"Your words sound like something only an extremely mentally deficient actor would say. Are you trying to put on a show for everyone?\" Bei Kun's face turned beet-red at the insult before he furiously shouted back, \"Let's see how long you will continue to laugh!\"He stepped outwards, and the resonant power within him started to surge out of him into the skies. A faint tiger roar could be heard and a sense of suppression could be felt by those who were in his presence.This was Bei Kun, owner of the Cruel Mountain-Splitting Tiger Resonance, a sixth-grade resonance. The creature itself lived up to its namesake of being a strong and violent fiend, and hence the resonance provided the user with matchless strength that could even split a mountain!Li Luo could faintly feel the baleful aura emitting from Bei Kun, and he instantly focused himself. Bei Kun was a whole level stronger than the previous two as he was supported by the sixth-grade Cruel Mountain-Splitting Tiger Resonance. Looking at things from a whole, Bei Kun would clearly be considered a peak stage Sixth Seal cultivator.Compared to him, Li Luo only possessed Fifth Seal resonant power, and his waterlight resonance was only fifth-grade. On paper, it looked as though he was at a disadvantage in every way.However, victory and defeat did not depend solely on these factors!Dong!Bei Kun roused his entire body and the resonance projection. Without hesitation, he shot out like a bullet, like a ferocious tiger protecting its territory. The spear in his hands possessed violent and vigorous energy as it lanced towards Li Luo.Li Luo's metal staff was once again wreathed with blue resonant power which looked like endless waves circulating around it, directly colliding with Bei Kun's blow.Dang!When the two metal weapons clashed, shockwaves blasted out from the point of impact, and Li Luo's silhouette could be seen shooting outwards like a cannonball. However, with his quick steps akin to a slippery eel, he was quickly able to regain a sense of balance and managed to mitigate that ridiculously berserk blow.\"Hmph. Just Fifth Seal resonant power!\" In that single clash, Bei Kun had been able to determine the difference in quality of resonant power. \"I thought you had encountered a reversal of fortunes, but it wasn't that great at all.\" He coldly snorted. As he spoke, he continued to attack like a tiger pouncing on its prey. His spear was once again endowed with mighty strength as it pierced the air relentlessly, creating countless spear shadows that swooped towards Li Luo.It was clear he wanted to take advantage of Li Luo's momentary weakness and to deliver a vicious finishing blow to end it all.Facing Bei Kun's pursuit, Li Luo did not choose to retreat. He remained calm and stood his ground as the spear and rod exchanged countless strikes, letting out resonating sounds through the arena with every clash.The two were entangled closely together, their resonant power constantly fluctuating and creating a rather intense sight for all the viewers.However, as the struggle continued, Bei Kun's expression gradually became uglier and uglier. He was gradually discovering that the resonant power that surged forth from his opponent's metal staff was continuously getting stronger over time.Even the geniuses of the First School were unable to see what was happening.\"Li Luo is actually able to block Bei Kun's explosive display of strength. That's strange... he clearly only has Fifth Seal resonant power.\"\"Why is Li Luo's water resonant power getting progressively stronger? What's going on?\"\"That is a high-grade resonance art, the Nine Layered Jade Waves. It is extremely appropriate for water resonance users. It's a move that starts weak but grows stronger over time. The user's strength is like the waves of a sea, gradually accumulating energy over time. This coupled with the water resonance power being extremely enduring is a ridiculously strong combination. As the fight drags on, the stronger the user will become, unless absolute strength is used to break the move completely! It allows one to grind any opponent down.\"\"If Bei Kun is unable to break through this defense, his defeat is certain.\"The geniuses of the First School had their faces turn grave at this explanation. Even amongst the First School, there were few students that were able to utilize high-grade resonance arts like the Nine Layered Jade Waves. Li Luo being able to effortlessly utilize this art demonstrated his sheer skill.\"Li Luo is clearly Southwind Academy's number one expert in terms of resonance arts,\" said someone amongst the group, causing the rest to sigh. Li Luo did not possess significant amounts of resonant power in the past and so they never felt concerned. The fact now was that he had manifested his own resonance, and they could see for themselves what sort of thorny problems an opponent with a combination of excellent resonance arts and the power to back it up could create.Dong!Just as they were speaking, Bei Kun bellowed with fury. He was aware that his situation was not good and that Li Luo clearly did not have strong resonant power. Yet it was like he was trapped in a whirlpool, gradually having his might siphoned away.Additionally, he wasn't able to explain why Li Luo's resonant power seemed to also possess a certain purity to it.Regardless, Bei Kun knew that the battle could not proceed this way.An ominous glint flashed through his eyes, and with just both palms, he unexpectedly grasped the metal spear tightly. From that stance, shadows of tiger paws could be seen on his hands, resonant power explosively emanating outwards.\"High-grade resonance art! Piercing Fang!\"Bei Kun took a single step forward with the spear in his hands, akin to a fearsome tiger leaping out of its den, stabbing outwards. This savage blow directly tore apart the countless waves of water resonance power, attempting to impale Li Luo.Li Luo stared at the sudden spear strike that truly resembled a penetrating fang, quickly summoning up all of his water resonance power in response. Resonant power like a massive tide rushed out and infused into his metal staff.The two weapons did not directly clash, but rather crisscrossed and went at each other directly.\"You're courting death!\" Bei Kun's expression was sinister as his eyes glinted with feral intent. Without the slightest hint of hesitation, he continued to stab forward at Li Luo. At this crucial moment, he suddenly noticed the blue light on the staff flash dazzlingly, his eyes directly struck by this brightness, temporarily blinding him.It was at the very moment that Bei Kun squinted in an attempt to restore his vision that he realized that his spear had struck mid air, striking the space above Li Luo's shoulder instead.\"I'm doomed.\"\u00a0Bei Kun's heart turned cold. He did not understand what had just happened, as his spear was originally lunging towards Li Luo's shoulder.There was not enough time to react before Li Luo struck back with his heavy staff, directly smashing Bei Kun's face.Pu! Chi!A mouth of fresh blood and shattered teeth were spat out along with a pitiful cry. Bei Kun was also sent flying, landing outside of the platform with a heavy thud.That pathetic cry echoed around the entire area.Li Luo casually put away the staff and exhaled deeply. The blue resonant power that was being emitted also gradually disappeared.The entire audience was so silent, one could hear a pin drop. The only noise was being made by a crying Bei Kun.But the silence did not last long\u2014it was interrupted by ear-rending screams and cheers an instant later. Other than the First School, who had lost, every school was cheering like there was no tomorrow!They could hardly believe what had just transpired...They had witnessed the once-influential individual of Southwind Academy rising from the ashes with an unbelievable radiance.They had seen the one who had once been mocked for having a blank palace and even relegated to the Second School perform a clean sweep of one against three!Zhao Kuo was so excited and emotional that his entire face had turned red. At the same time, he even performed several gestures of contempt at his fellow academy students from the First School, arrogantly cheering...\"CAN YOU SEE THIS?!\"THE MAN IS BACK!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0021\u2013 Eve of the ExaminationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEndless cheers could be heard from the wooden platform on the Tree of Resonant Power. With the exception of those from First School, everyone was celebrating jubilantly.No one had expected such a result.Everyone had assumed that the competition today would have a foregone conclusion, it was just a formality for the Second School to lose five Gold Leaves. But the tables were turned when the three Sixth Seal Stage cultivators of the First School were singlehandedly wrecked by Li Luo.This was truly an exciting show from start to finish.Most importantly, this entire brouhaha had been preceded by numerous dramatic events. Li Luo was a student of the First School who had been demoted to the Second School, and he had a natural blank palace and apparently limited potential as well...But now Li Luo was standing right in front of everyone with a mysteriously obtained resonance, demonstrating overwhelming strength. Just how complicated would Lin Feng's heart be right now, seeing that the very person he had shunned had come back to haunt him?The students were all amazed at this sight, inevitably focusing on the youth of the hour, reexamining their own thoughts. Could it be that this youth who had once fallen from grace would rise from the ashes? However, wasn't it a little too late...?As the noise continued unabated, the students of the First School were looking at each other in silence and with complicated expressions on their faces.Difa Qing stared blankly at Li Luo. And at this moment, someone behind asked, \"Was he not supposed to have a blank palace? How could he suddenly have manifested a resonance?\" Song Yunfeng was expressionless as he was unable to fathom how this was possible.\"Being able to manifest a resonance artificially may be rare but not impossible. There are numerous heavenly treasures that allow one to obtain an acquired resonance. Unfortunately, these items are so uncommon that one might only be seen within the Xia Kingdom every few hundred years. However, Li Luo's parents are unimaginably mighty, and this might not be something out of their reach,\" Lu Qing'er piped in.Lu Qing'er's Second Uncle was the president of a branch of the Golden Dragon Bank, which also had branches spanning across the continent. As a result of being so widespread, it naturally possessed knowledge that was not common information.\"If he did possess such a treasure, why did he wait till now to use it?\" Difa Qing asked.\"Perhaps there are some specific conditions for it. I don't know the details.\" Lu Qing'er gave a wry smile.Difa Qing fell into silence before finally replying, \"Is this brat finally experiencing a change of fortune?\"The tone was complex as she hailed from the Difa family, one that was in constant struggle against House Luolan. It was significantly smaller than the Song family and hence never directly clashed against House Luolan. As a result, she and Li Luo did not possess significant enmity, except for the fact that Li Luo had stolen Jiang Qing'e from her\u2026\"How could it be so easy?\" Song Yunfeng sad inspidly. \"Li Luo's resonance should be a water resonance. Judging by the way he clashed against Bei Kun, you can roughly tell that his is only a fifth or sixth-grade resonance. Such a mediocre resonance may not be bad, but it's definitely not exceptional.\"His resonance power should only be that at the Fifth Seal. Can a mere fifth or sixth-grade resonance coupled with Fifth Seal resonant power be considered impressive?\"Difa Qing nodded in agreement. If this was the case, then Li Luo wouldn't even be strong enough to rank in the top 10 of the First School. Even though he had heaven-defying talent when it came to the application of resonance arts, it would still be an arduous task to become someone truly outstanding within the First School.Most importantly, the final examination was barely a month away. Just how could Li Luo bridge the gap in such a short period of time?Thus, Difa Qing could only conclude that this was impossible.At this point, Difa Qing could feel the worry within her heart dissipate and heaved a sigh of relief. Even she did not notice that watching Li Luo's performance had caused her to feel pressure. She was clearly unwilling to see Li Luo ascend to greatness.Lu Qing'er did not participate in their conversation, merely focusing her gaze upon Li Luo.\u201cYou've finally resolved the issue with your blank palace.... Now, will you be able to catch up during the final segment of the race?\u201dWhilst the cacophony continued around the platform, the area above the platform was filled with deafening silence as the teachers and dean were speechless.Even Xu Shanyue was astonished at this turn of events.Lin Feng, on the other hand, had no spoken from start to end, expressionless like a wooden block.The rest of the teachers, on the other hand, turned to look at Lin Feng, smiles of mockery on their faces.In the end, it was the old dean who ended the deadlock with a clap. \"It looks like he truly is the son of those two. I suppose he counts as a late bloomer?\"Lin Feng insipidly replied, \"Dean, you need to watch your words. Fifth Seal resonant power with a mere fifth or sixth-grade water resonance doesn't mean much.\"The old dean shook his head. He knew that Lin Feng was feeling extremely dissatisfied at this point, but he continued to smile. \"You are simply just too prideful. It's just a matter of time before you suffer because of it.\"Lin Feng did not reply to that and instead turned to Xu Shanyue. \"My First School was simply not up to par. As agreed upon, ten Gold Leaves are yours. These kids have no ability to call their own, and teaching them a lesson is not a bad thing.\"Xu Shanyue mocked, \"I thought you would want to raise the notion of Li Luo re-entering First School.\"\"You're thinking too much. I will let you know right now that he is not that amazing. My First School does not lack such an ordinary student. More importantly, he should be focusing on catching up within this short period of one month. After all, being able to enter Astral Sage College is what truly matters.\" Lin Feng smirked.He had definitely been caught on the backfoot when Li Luo suddenly appeared with his water resonance. However, it wasn't to the point where he felt a sense of pity for kicking Li Luo out.Furthermore, this water resonance had appeared too late. Li Luo was only at the Fifth Seal Stage, and the gradehis water resonance was not particularly high. Hence, from Lin Feng's perspective, Li Luo had only managed to extricate half of his body from the quagmire he was in. Did Li Luo truly think that the elites of First School were merely decorative objects on his path to the pinnacle? No!As he had mentioned, the most important fact was that the final examinations were about to arrive and Li Luo had very limited time to catch up. After this point, everyone would leave Southwind Academy, so there was no need for him to care about how Li Luo would develop in the future.Missing the opportunity to enter the Astral Sage College would be Li Luo's loss. This would not change even with his status as the young lord of House Luolan.After consoling himself, Lin Feng's expression became more relaxed as well.At this point, the old dean proceeded to the platform and waved at Li Luo. Seeing this, Li Luo paused for a moment before finally walking towards the dean.\"Good day, Dean.\" Li Luo greeted him with a smile.The old dean smiled happily as he examined Li Luo. \"Have you solved the problem of your blank palace?\"Li Luo nodded. \"Yes. It's a fifth-grade water resonance.\"When Lin Feng heard Li Luo speak, he couldn't help but smile. \"Li Luo, your water resonance is considered mid-grade. But don't worry, if you work hard, you will definitely achieve something.\"\"Teacher Lin Feng, you don't have to worry too much about this. Although the resonance's grade can affect one's cultivation speed, it's still possible to reach the Duke or even the King Stage with a fifth-grade resonance,\" Li Luo patiently explained.Lin Feng replied almost mockingly. \"Reaching the Duke or King Stage with a mere fifth-grade resonance? These are just childish fantasies. Do you truly believe in them?\" The old dean waved his hand, indicating for Lin Feng to stop, before saying to Li Luo, \"Your confidence is what's most important. However, there's only a month left before the final examination. If you want to catch up, you will have to put in untold times more effort than others.\"Li Luo nodded in agreement. \"I understand.\"After a few more perfunctory sentences, he let Li Luo leave and at the same time turned to face the audience. \"There is barely a month's time left before the final examination. In two weeks' time, we will hold our preliminary examinations. Additionally, the Astral Sage College has published their basic requirements for the year. You will have to be at least at the Seventh Seal Stage.\" This proclamation came down like a sledgehammer on numerous students' hearts. The Seventh Seal Stage was an insurmountable barrier for many, and everyone felt frustrated and dejected upon hearing this news.Only some of the most elite students within the First School were smiling.Being the best college of the Xia Kingdom, even when considering its peers in the surrounding kingdoms, the Astral Sage College was not a place where people could enter as they pleased.\"No one below the Seventh Seal Stage...\" Li Luo smacked his lips in response. He did not feel that there was anything strange with that request. He was currently at the Fifth Seal, so there were two more stages to go. It looked as though he would have to train feverishly if he wanted to succeed.Furthermore, this was just the most basic requirement. One still had to engage in battle as well. Thus, if Li Luo required more insurance, he would clearly have to temper his waterlight resonance again.The only problem was that the gap between a fifth-grade resonance and a sixth-grade resonance was not tiny. After doing some quick calculations, it truly seemed like a coincidence that the entire Tianshu Province's income for House Luolan would just barely be enough. He would wipe it clean.As he was deep in thought, the students who were in the vicinity gradually started to scatter. At this point, he suddenly noticed someone approaching him.When he turned to look, he noticed that it was Lu Qing'er calmly looking at him.\"Congratulations, Young Lord.\"When he saw her, his instincts kicked in and he reflexively wanted to avoid her. However, just as he took a step away, he awkwardly stopped himself.\"Hello hello. How are you doing?\" Li Luo replied with the most perfunctory of greetings.\"You're not planning to hide?\" Lu Qing'er probed.An embarrassed Li Luo quickly replied, \"Hide? What do you mean? No such thing has ever happened!\"Lu Qing'er did not bother to follow up on that and continued, \"Li Luo, I have always been very thankful for your guidance in the resonance arts. It's just unfortunate that you've chosen to actively distance and hide yourself from me. I have never coveted your position, and you should know that that isn't something that is given but must be earned with strength.\"Li Luo, I am now the strongest within Southwind Academy. If you want to reclaim this throne, then you will have to beat me. I used to worry about hurting your feelings and never wanted to say this to you, considering your situation. However, things are different now since you have solved the issue of your blank palace. If you truly are a man, then you will reclaim what is rightfully yours.\"At this sudden declaration, Li Luo could only bitterly smile. \"Then it looks like I need to work hard.\"Lu Qing'er smiled in response, but Li Luo could sense a cold and slightly annoyed glint leaking out of her eyes...\"I am waiting for you. Let me tell you now. Your actions these past few years have caused me to appreciate you a lot less. If I have the chance...\" At this point, she stopped, the cold glare in her eyes evident of her stance.After speaking, she turned and left.Li Luo was left speechless as he watched her gradually disappear into the distance, only able to shake his head helplessly. It seemed as though he had offended her. It seemed that the prettier the lady, the more petty they were!In the midst of his sigh, he could feel that yet another individual was focused upon him, so he turned his head to look.Right atop the wooden platform was a frosty-looking youth absolutely glowering at him, his expression seeming to be a warning.This was the second strongest student in the First School, Song Yunfeng.Their two gazes intersected and clashed. Song Yunfeng continued to scowl at him with a sharp and combative glint in his eyes. He then lightly shook his head and coldly mouthed some words.\"Li Luo, don't stick your nose where it's not supposed to. Stay away from Lu Qing'er.\" He believed that Li Luo would understand what he was trying to say, as this was something quite obvious.On the other hand, Li Luo, who was not too far away, was frowning, muttering to himself, \"What the hell is that fool trying to do? Why doesn't he just shout out what he wants to say? Why is he making things so difficult?? Moving his lips like that makes him look like a mouse who is sneakily eating scraps. Sigh...what is he trying to get at?\"As he could not decipher what Song Yunfeng was trying to say, he simply shook his head and couldn't be bothered anymore, turning to leave.On the other hand, Song Yunfeng was still completely focused on Li Luo's silhouette. His eyes seemed to ooze gloominess as he squinted at him.Li Luo's previous gaze had reminded him of what Li Luo was like at his most glorious period in Southwind Academy. The Li Luo then radiated brilliance and was unmatched.However, things were no longer the same... Song Yunfeng was so furious at this response that the wooden railing he was grasping cracked.\u201cLi Luo, what exactly are you trying to do?\u201cDo you truly believe that a 5th-grade resonance will allow you to do as you please?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0022: The Price of a Sixth\u2013Grade ResonancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKnowledge of Li Luo's fifth-grade water resonance spread throughout the school very quickly. This naturally became the hottest topic of discussion.\"Who would have thought that Li Luo would manage to rise from the ashes! An acquired resonance... this is something I've never heard of.\"\"I heard that it was a treasure left behind by his parents! It's clearly something rarely seen.\"\"Having great parents truly makes me green with envy! I'm so jealous!\"\"Well, it's not that amazing. After all, it's just a fifth-grade water resonance. It's not that exceptional, and the final examination is barely a month away. How can he possibly catch up to those at the top with so little time?\"\"Yeah. He may have beaten Bei Kun and his goons, but those three aren't even in the top ten of the First School. I heard the top ten are all at least at the Seventh Seal Stage. Song Yunfeng and Lu Qing'er are the two scariest ones out of the lot\u2014apparently they're at the Eighth Seal or higher already...\"\"Mm. Li Luo has already squandered the most crucial time for growth. I don't think he can catch up in a month.\"Whilst everyone was fervently making Li Luo the topic of discussion, the man himself had just finished a round of cultivation and was quickly making his way out the academy.\"Even though I beat Bei Kun today, it was more draining than I expected. If not for borrowing the light resonance power of my resonance to blind Bei Kun at the crucial moment, I might have taken even more time than I wanted...\"Whilst on his carriage back home, Li Luo continued to analyze the day's battles. He wasn't looking relaxed as expected. Instead, a dissatisfied and solemn expression was plastered over his face.At this rate, his current strength coupled with the waterlight resonance and his expertise at resonance arts would easily allow him to contend with a Sixth Seal Stage cultivator. However, if he were to encounter a Seventh Seal stage expert, his chances of victory would be extremely low.\"This is not enough. This is FAR from enough,\" he murmured to himself. His aim was to enter the Astral Sage College. The number of hopefuls that were competing with him were too many to count. If he was not at the top, his odds would be too low.The biggest constraint that everyone had mentioned was his lack of time\u2014barely a month was left before the crucial moment. If he wanted to catch up, he would have to quickly improve his resonant power, and it looked like tempering his waterlight resonance was the only way.Only then would he have the confidence to face off against Lu Qing'er and those other elites.The key problem still lay in tempering his waterlight resonance to the sixth grade. This would be no easy matter...\"I guess I need to have a discussion with Elder Sister Cai Wei...\"\u00a0Li Luo's lips were puckered at that very thought. He had this strange feeling that if he were to mention needing huge amounts of fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights to Cai Wei, she might very well just devour him alive.......The old manor, the administrative office.Cai Wei was currently sitting at her table, carefully inspecting the book of records. She was dressed in a pale-yellow robe and her egg-shaped face was enthralling as always, possessing an air of grace.She had already been at work for quite a while and was getting tired, hence she reached forward and gingerly placed the book down on the table.\u201cHu!\u201dIt was as though a weight had been lifted off her shoulders as she gently heaved a sigh of relief, looking clearly more relaxed.Weng!It was at this point that \u00a0the door suddenly swung open and Li Luo strode in with gusto. \"Elder Sister Cai Wei!\"Bang!When the door was slammed, Li Luo noticed the relaxed Cai Wei in front of him. Her mind had clearly not registered this sudden intrusion, and her beautiful gaze seemed a little dazed at the sight of Li Luo.The atmosphere suddenly seemed to freeze at this moment.Cai Wei immediately snapped to attention, sitting up straight as though she had been electrocuted. Her fair complexion was tinted with the red of embarrassment whilst her gaze stared coquettishly at Li Luo.\"Did no one ever teach you to knock before entering?\"Li Luo was currently dripping with cold sweat as he hastily nodded. \"I'm sorry, Elder Sister Cai Wei! I will definitely take note of this in the future!\"Seeing his respectful attitude, Cai Wei no longer felt ashamed but still asked brusquely, \"May I know what instruction the Young Lord has?\"Li Luo looked around sheepishly, making sure that no one else was around before carefully closing the door. \"I want to let Elder Sister Cai Wei see a certain treasure of mine...\" His voice was lowered, but before he could finish his sentence, he was shocked silly. This was because he saw Cai Wei whip out a gleaming bow, a dangerous smile on her beautiful egg-shaped face.\"Young Lord, before you do anything rash, don't forget that I'm also a resonant master.\"Frightened, Li Luo hastily waved his hands, bitterly smiling. \"Elder Sister Cai Wei, what do you mean? What are you trying to do!?\"A little taken aback as well, Cai Wei's raised her eyebrow slightly as she asked curiously, all the while focused on Li Luo's every move, \"Then just what sort of 'treasure' of yours are you referring to?\"Li Luo was a little confused at this turn of events... However, he didn't speak anymore and instead willed his resonant power to surge. In a blink, blue resonant power started to shroud his body, blazing upwards. The sight of the resonant power resembled waves of water flowing so much that one could literally imagine hearing it.He had revealed his fifth-grade water resonance.Pa!Cai Wei gradually lowered the bow in her hands as she asked in surprise, \"You... you have a resonance?\"Li Luo nodded. \"A fifth-grade one too.\"Cai Wei was absolutely stupefied at this scene. Only after a good minute had passed did she finally react. \"Is this the result of the secret art left behind by the two House Lords?\" Li Luo nodded in response.At this point, she came to her senses. Thinking of her previous actions, her face flushed a bright crimson-red. Li Luo's previous words seemed to have held a deeper meaning, and she wasn't a naive youth...hence she was flustered and even thought that Li Luo was about to do something extremely unsavory...She felt incomparably embarrassed at this turn of events. Cai Wei, oh, Cai Wei. What a huge humiliation!Still, she was someone who had encountered all sorts of experiences and very quickly composed herself, smiling as though nothing had happened. \"Congratulations, Young Lord! If Qing'e knew of this, she would be elated.\"Li Luo nodded. \"There's only a little problem. Perhaps Elder Sister Cai Wei might have already guessed what it is...\"\"Do you still require spirit liquids and purifying lights?\" Cai Wei frowned slightly after hearing his last sentence.\"Mhm. Unfortunately, I will need fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. This resonance which my parents left behind requires endless amounts of spirit liquids and purifying lights to cultivate. Otherwise, it might very possibly dissipate...\" Li Luo did not want to mention the fact that he could endlessly temper his resonance with copious amounts of spirit liquids and purifying lights. If news of this were to spread, the situation would definitely turn grave, and he temporarily did not wish for this to be revealed, at least not until he could protect himself.\"Fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights...\" The frown on Cai Wei's face deepened to the point that even her two eyebrows were touching.Fourth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights roughly cost around a thousand pieces of skygold each. Fifth-grade ones would easily cost over five times that.This was definitely an expensive consumable good.If Li Luo only required a few, then this would not be a problem. However, from experience, Cai Wei understood that what Li Luo needed was probably in the hundreds... This would not be a small sum.Cai Wei's expression was constantly changing as she struggled with this though. What was more surprising to Li Luo was that she did not find any reasons to push back and merely nodded. \"I understand. I will do my best to carry out your instructions.\"She raised her head and saw Li Luo's absolutely flabbergasted expression before breaking out into a smile. \"Did you think that I was going to reject you? You are the Young Lord of House Luolan. Everything belongs to you and Sister Qing'e. So long as you're not being coerced into it, whatever you want will become a reality. In any case, now that you have a resonance, you will finally be able to hold some influence within House Luolan. This is incomparable to the physical costs of these spirit liquids and purifying lights. How could I possibly reject your request?\"Extremely touched, Li Luo passionately replied, \"Elder Sister Cai Wei! You're truly great at understanding others! In this case, could you please get me several dozen portions immediately?\"Cai Wei began to massage her temples upon hearing Li Luo's excited follow-up. \"Well, this can be done. It's just that if you require a similar amount again, we don't have the funds to purchase more.\" House Luolan's businesses in the Tianshu Province only brought in around three hundred thousand pieces of skygold a year. The previous request for fourth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights had already cost around a hundred and fifty thousand pieces of skygold. After buying another thirty pieces or so, there would barely be any money left.Cai Wei sighed deeply. \"Young Lord, I plan to sell off some of the businesses within the Tianshu Province.\"House Luolan does not have much strength within the Tianshu Province. Thus, many businesses can be considered burdens to us as we are unable to properly protect them. In a sense, we are overstaffed here. Combined with the suppression of the three families, if this were to continue, it would only result in a grievous loss to us whilst taking up precious resources. The key reason lies with the three families. The three of them have an alliance in place to deal with House Luolan jointly, as they all have similar goals. If we were to voluntarily offer up some businesses and execute this well, it could very possibly lead them to struggle amongst themselves. Ultimately, this will also breed internal strife when their benefits are compromised, making it harder for them to deal with House Luolan in a united fashion.\"Li Luo considered her point of view and nodded in agreement after a while. \"Elder Sister Cai Wei is truly decisive. You are making a sacrifice for the greater good. I am honestly unfamiliar with such matters and will leave this in your wise hands. Regardless of what you choose to do, I will support your decision,\" Li Luo said in praise of her.\"I am truly thankful for your trust.\" Cai Wei gave a small smile.Li Luo waved his hands and then a thought suddenly came to mind. \"Oh, yes! Does the Tianshu Province have any resonance artificers? If I could craft my own, then it would undoubtedly be cheaper than buying them off the market, yes?\"\"Well, of course we have resonance artificers. House Luolan has businesses in every aspect of the economy. This sort of profession is always in demand as the supply of spirit liquids and purifying lights is never enough. Our House Luolan has plenty of resonance artificers who are able to craft third-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. However, for those of a higher grade, the number of resonance artificers who are able to do so are a lot less, thus our production capabilities for that are also low. When it comes to fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights... I'm afraid there is no one in Tianshu Province who is able to craft them. All of those that can be bought in the market have been imported from Xia City.\"A sudden revelation dawned upon Li Luo. Of course! Someone who could craft fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights would be minimally a fifth-grade resonance artificer. Such individuals would only be found in cradles of civilization, the subject of any cultivator's worship. Why would they be hiding in such a desolate area like the Tianshu Province? It was natural that they were rarely seen here as a result.\"Can Elder Sister Cai Wei bring me to where House Luolan crafts their spirit liquids and purifying lights? I have a water resonance and thus would like to gain some knowledge about the path of a resonance artificer.\" The price of these tempering treasures was exorbitantly high, and he was only talking about fifth-grade ones. In the future, he would even require seventh, eighth, and even ninth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights! Just how was he going to find them, much less pay for them? He also knew that in the entire Xia Kingdom, there were very few spirit liquids and purifying lights of the 7th-grade and above sold each year.The only way would be to rely on himself.Thus, he had to make preparations to progress on the path of a resonance artificer.Cai Wei did not disagree.\"Alright. I will take you there tomorrow.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Truthfully speaking, what everyone felt towards him was only pity and nothing else. Why would they respect him? That made no sense.The way they saw it, Li Luo was decently strong, but he still had a blank palace. This meant that his resonant power was limited. It was just a matter of time before they would surpass him.However, Li Luo had demonstrated his acquired resonance in the competition yesterday, furthermore sweeping all three opponents from the First School in a single bout. This led them to understand that Li Luo was truly not on the same level as them.Although a fifth-grade resonance was not considered high, it was more than sufficient. This combined with his talent in resonance arts was like adding wings to a tiger. The future Li Luo may not necessarily reach the absolute peak, but he would definitely rank in the upper echelons.Thus, who would dare to pity Li Luo even now? On top of that, he was also House Luolan's Young Lord. Just who had the right to pity someone so much better than them in every way?As they saw Li Luo walk past, certain students even took the initiative to greet him. \"Brother Luo.\"There were even some daring girls who complimented him directly. \"Brother Luo looks extraordinarily handsome today.\"Taking these greetings in his stride, Li Luo merely smiled at them before returning to his usual seat. At this point, even Zhao Kuo was looking at him with a burning gaze.\"You're a man, right? Can you not look at me that way?\" Li Luo frowned.Zhao Kuo chuckled as he feigned a melancholic expression. \"It looks like I have to give up my title of number one in the Second School...\"\"Who cares about such trivialities!? Set your sights further,\" Li Luo snapped.\"Further? In that case, all the best! Once you bring glory to Southwind Academy's males, we will cheer for you from the sidelines!\" Zhao Kuo retorted.\"What do you mean?\"Zhao Kuo angrily explained, \"Didn't you know? The other academies of the Tianshu Province have been constantly insulting us, saying that we are all feminine sissies, that we lack any form of manly vigor. Eastpool Academy is exceptionally hateful. They always take the initiative to mock the males of Southwind Academy. We first produced the legendary Sister Qing'e and now the strongest one of our generation is Lu Qing'er. It's as though we can only hide behind girls!\"Of course, there were other academies in the Tianshu Province. It was just that most of them were not as famous as Southwind Academy. In recent years, Eastpool Academy had risen through the ranks dramatically and was looking to contest for the title of the best academy in the Tianshu Province.As the two were bantering, Xu Shanyue entered the training fields. It looked as though his mood wasn't bad, his usual, serious expression replaced with a smile.\"Good morning, students. The First School has kindly provided ten Gold Leaves for the Second School's use. From today onwards, we will have ten more to distribute.\" Hearing Xu Shanyue's words, the class cheered in excitement. The final examinations were approaching and these leaves might very well provide them with an opportunity to take another step forward.\"These Gold Leaves were obtained by Li Luo's solo victory. All of you should express your gratitude directly.\" After which, the entire class broke out into raucous applause. There were even some delicate and good-looking girls who shouted out bravely, \"I'm willing to have lunch with you to express my thanks!\" Everyone could only stare in envy at his good fortune.Li Luo helplessly smiled, but deep down he sighed. He could not understand where their fascination in him lay and could only ignore their teasing.Xu Shanyue clenched his fist, signalling for everyone to settle down before proceeding on to the day's lesson.Three hours later, the class ended and Li Luo approached Xu Shanyue, looking to take the afternoon off.\"You're taking leave again?\" Xu Shanyue queried as he thought about the request. If this was in the past, he wouldn't have hesitated to reject his request. However, Li Luo had managed to beat the First School and had given him the credibility to stand tall against Liu Yang. Hence, he acceded to it. \"Sure. Do remember that the final examination is about to arrive and you've already missed out on a week of training. You need to quickly catch up, or there will be no hope in entering the Astral Sage College.\" Li Luo smiled and agreed, waving goodbye before quickly taking his leave.Outside the academy gates was a luxurious carriage, akin to a moving palace. As Li Luo made his way into it, he realized that Cai Wei was already sitting within, by the window.In her hand was a round laced fan, lightly fluttering. Beside her was also a cup of piping hot tea, the entire scene accentuating her mature beauty. This coupled with her beautiful curves and exquisite features would absolutely captivate any mortal man.One could clearly see that Cai Wei was a lady with refined mannerisms. The choice of carriage was not only luxurious-looking but also comfortable, demonstrating her exceptional taste that was even better than Jiang Qing'e's.Li Luo had a feeling that Cai Wei's background was not simple. The only question here was why had she chosen to run all the way over to House Luolan to handle miscellaneous tasks?\"Have you eaten? I've prepared lunch for you.\" Cai Wei batted a glance at Li Luo, her slender, jade-like fingers beckoning at the table in front, which was currently laid with a sumptuous feast.\"Elder Sister Cai Wei is truly too considerate. Whoever marries you will truly be blessed,\" Li Luo praised. Cai Wei was capable at managing the affairs of a family whilst being beautiful and mature. No matter how one looked at it, she was truly outstanding.Amongst the women he had met, in terms of attractiveness and temperament, Jiang Qing'e was the most extraordinary. Lu Qing'er and Cai Wei were both equal, with their own redeeming features.\"Your words are truly sweet.\" Cai Wei smiled as she beckoned for Li Luo to eat. At the same time, she continued to explain, \"Our House Luolan has a specialized department whose purpose is to refine spirit liquids and purifying lights. It's known as the Suncreek Villa, and it is decently well known throughout the market for their tempering treasures when we look within the Xia Kingdom. The Suncreek Villa's headquarters is in Xia City and it has three branches spread throughout the Xia Kingdom. Coincidentally, one of these branches can be found in the City of Southwind. The Suncreek Villa is responsible for a significant amount of the profits House Luolan rakes in yearly. Hence, within House Luolan, Pei Hao has also fought the hardest to take control of them, trying all means to do so. The president of this particular branch left some time ago for some reason and the position was left vacant for a while as a replacement could not be easily found. Pei Hao recruited the vice president and attempted to use him to take control of this branch. Luckily, Qing'e realized his plans and very quickly dispatched someone to clamp down on those moves. As a result, this branch of the Suncreek Villa has some internal complications, ultimately affecting the amount of spirit liquids and purifying lights it produces.\"\"Pei Hao, that bastard! Truly a waste of air.\" Li Luo couldn't help but vent. He previously wasn't interested in these matters, but now that he had to utilize significant amounts of resources from the house, he realized just how much trouble that white-eyed wolf really was.If House Luolan had actually been united, then the amount of resources he could mobilize wouldn't just be this piddling three hundred thousand skygold!Slightly depressed, the feast in front of him seemed to have lost some of its fragrance\u2026The carriage passed through the crowded City of Southwind, eventually stopping at the northern part of the city.Li Luo and Cai Wei both got off the carriage. They could see a humongous pavilion in front of them with a\u00a0Suncreek Villa\u00a0sign hung right in front.The Suncreek Villa possessed strict security with numerous protectors, but they immediately made way and let the duo through once they spotted them.They entered the building unobstructed, and at this moment, a group arrived to receive them.Li Luo could see that this group was split into two factions. The group on the left was led by a smiling middle-aged man, while the group on the right was led by a lady that was amazingly beautiful, such that any man who saw her would instantly perk up with attention.She was an elegant young lady with a pretty complexion; a pert, high nose; and a pair of silver circular glasses. She had long hair that cascaded down her back and she carried an air of undisguised arrogance.At this moment, Cai Wei quickly brought Li Luo up to speed.\"The one on the left is Zhuang Yi, he's the vice president dispatched by Pei Hao. The beauty on the right is Yan Lingqing. She is a genius resonance artificer from Astral Sage College. She is also Qing'e's close confidante. She is currently a fourth-grade resonance artificer and also one of Qing'e's reinforcements.\"Li Luo seemed a little shocked at this as he couldn't help but to stare at the slender, glasses-wearing, cold, and arrogant beauty.He would never have expected that she was also from Astral Sage College, the place he had always dreamed of attending.1. What Zhao Kuo actually says is that the men of Southwind Academy possess strong Yin energy and feeble Yang energy. Because females are traditionally Yin and men YangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Keke. Your presence here truly illuminates our humble dwelling.\" The one named Zhuang Yi immediately rattled off the top of his tongue, an honest and enthusiastic look on his face.Compared to his hearty reception, Yan Lingqing was much cooler in response. She merely glanced at Cai Wei before taking a quick look at Li Luo. Following which, she stuck her hands in her pocket. It didn't seem like she was planning to introduce herself.\"Vice President Zhuang Yi's words are too kind. The Young Lord is here to take a look at his house's businesses. There's nothing special about this after all.\" Cai Wei gave a small smile.Zhuang Yi was stunned for a moment before he hastily smiled and nodded. \"It was I who spoke out of turn.\" After which, he rushed to Li Luo and greeted him respectfully before excusing himself politely and heading off to settle his other matters.Li Luo took in all of this and realized it was clear that Zhuang Yi was fully supporting Pei Hao. Hence, when they first met, despite Zhuang Yi's warm reception, he kept his distance and remained on guard.This was clearly something that was faked.On the other hand, despite the cold reception from Yan Lingqing, she still continued to stay with the duo, and did not look to get away at the first opportunity.However, after seeing Zhuang Yi speedily leaving, her expression turned slightly gentle. \"Elder Sister Cai Wei, may I kindly know why you are here today?\" Her voice was crisp and sweet, sounding like a gentle stream flowing, pleasant to the ear.Cai Wei walked forward and tightly grasped Yan Lingqing's forearms before smiling as well. \"I brought the Young Lord here to take a look around.\"Both of them possessed amazing temperaments and were matchless beauties, hence when they stood side by side, it was a feast for the eyes. At the same time, it also allowed one to clearly see the differences between the two.If Cai Wei was like the vast mountain ranges, with large humps that protruded from the ground, then Yan Lingqing was more similar to the massive plains where horses roamed...As Li Luo's gaze swept past the two of them, his conspicuous actions were inadvertently spotted by Yan Lingqing... Her snow-white chin raised slightly as she said disdainfully, \"Little Brother, just what are you trying to compare...?\"Li Luo could only innocently blink his eyes at that accusation.Without caring further, Yan Lingqing huffed and dragged Cai Wei away.Li Luo didn't really mind either and did his best to keep up.As they entered the depths of the Suncreek Villa, they walked onto a bridge. When one stood upon the bridge, they were able to see that there were two refining platforms that spanned countless levels.Each level of these refining platforms was split into numerous smaller rooms. Each room had a transparent, crystal wall, and peering through it would allow one to see countless individuals dressed in white busily working.Peering closer inside each room, there was a table laid out with numerous transparent crystal bottles. These white-garbed individuals were taking all sorts of bottles and canisters, constantly concocting something. Occasionally, these crystal bottles would emit a blue light, signifying the creation of a spirit liquid or purifying light.\"Elder Sister Cai Wei, there are two fourth-grade, nine third-grade, sixteen second-grade, and thirty three first-grade resonance artificers in this branch of the Suncreek Villa.\" Li Luo continued to peer curiously as Yan Lingqing's crystal-clear voice explained. Hearing this, he smirked inside. Cai Wei was the General Manager and naturally already knew of these matters and hence it was clear that she was only saying this for his benefit.Jiang Qing'e's bosom friend here may seem quite cool and uncaring, but she was actually a nice person at heart. At the same time, he understood that she was doing this for Jiang Qing'e's sake.They continued to walk and observe the surroundings as they made their way to Yan Lingqing's workspace. This was her refining workshop.\"I suppose Elder Sister Cai Wei isn't here just to see me?\" At this point, she removed her outer robes. revealing a simple outfit within which outlined her slender curves. Her gaze was currently fixated on the refining platform, her thoughts focused upon it.\"It's because of the Young Lord.\" Cai Wei gave a wry smile. \"He wants to become a resonance artificer.\"Yan Lingqing gave her a curious look and asked, \"Isn't he a ...\" She didn't finish her words, but the implication was clear. Wasn't Li Luo a natural blank palace? Why was there a need to become a resonance artificer?Cai Wei lightly patted Li Luo and directed a mischievous expression toward him. \"Go and start your show. Let's give our little genius the greatest shock of her life.\"Li Luo was speechless at Cai Wei's attempt to tease her friend. However, he activated his resonance, causing water resonant power to gradually arise around him.\"This... this is a water resonance?\" Yan Lingqing was truly surprised at this turn of events, so much so that she propped up her glasses on her pert, little nose. \"You have a resonance? What?\"Li Luo nodded and sincerely said, \"This is a fifth-grade water resonance, and I want to learn some resonance artificering arts in order to become a resonance artificer.\"After hearing his request, Yan Lingqing's eyebrows knitted together in slight confusion. \"Isn't it almost time for Southwind Academy's final examination? Why are you not bitterly cultivating? Why don't you try your best to get into the Astral Sage College before we discuss any further? After all, the Astral Sage College has the Resonance Tempering Hall, where you can learn from many excellent teachers.\"Li Luo could only smile sheepishly. \"I want to start familiarizing myself with this.\"Yan Lingqing seemed to have understood something upon hearing Li Luo's reply. Even though Li Luo had manifested a resonance, it was true that this was a little too late. With his current strength, he might not be able to make it into the Astral Sage College, and it would only be a matter of time before he would embark on the path of a resonance artificer. He still had a way out.\"It's rare that the Young Lord wishes to improve so fervently. I kindly beseech this genius to guide him,\" Cai Wei added in.Yan Lingqing rolled her eyes at Cai Wei's comments, immediately placing a crystal bottle in front of Li Luo. \"I believe you should have some rudimentary understanding of what resonance artificers do, yes?\"Seeing that Yan Lingqing was going to teach him, he quickly nodded. Ever since he obtained his water resonance, he spent some of his free time reading up and learning foundational knowledge on this subject.At this point, Yan Lingqing flicked her finger and a line of blue resonant power shot out of her index finger towards a bundle of books, adhering to it. With another flick, the books were thrown right in front of Li Luo.\"Read all of this.\" Li Luo didn't say much but simply got to work immediately, sitting down at the table and delving into the subject matter.\"Why don't you take a seat? I have some things I need to do,\" Yan Lingqing lightly said to Cai Wei after seeing Li Luo obediently begin his study without any indication of impatience. Following which, she proceeded to continue with the work that required her attention.Cai Wei, on the other hand, lazily stretched and took a seat, quickly dozing off\u2026At the same time, within another room of the Suncreek Villa\u2026\"What have the Young Lord and the General Manager been up to?\" Zhuang Yi was sitting on his seat, questioning an individual in front of him.\"Nothing much. They took a walk and were observing things before heading back to Vice President Yan's workshop,\" the person replied.Zhuang Yi nodded. \"Tail them closely. Watch out for whoever they interact with and take note of these people. The most important thing now is to ensure I become the president of this branch. Once I'm successful, I can chase away Yan Lingqing and all of her people. At that point, everything will be in my control.\"\"Understood!\"Zhuang Yi waved his hand and that individual retreated. A chilling smile appeared on his face.\"Jiang Qing'e, did you think that finding a little wench from your school would be enough to stop me? Let me tell you the truth! You're just dreaming! This branch of the Suncreek Villa belongs to me, Zhuang Yi!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He exhaled deeply, slowly rubbing his sore neck.Yan Lingqing and Cai Wei had been gaily chatting beside him the entire time. Upon hearing him, they stopped and looked over.\"Not bad. It looks like you are pretty patient.\" Yan Lingqing indifferently judged him. Despite the tone, it seemed as though she was still quite satisfied with Li Luo's performance.Patience was crucial for a resonance artificer. They had to spend countless repetitive cycles concocting and refining numerous materials in the process of improving their skills. At the same time, they had to be precise and not make mistakes. Just this fact alone required one to practice for a long period of time.Yan Lingqing got up and approached the workstation before signalling to Li Luo to come over.Atop the workstation were numerous crystal bottles, all filled with various strange and weird materials.\"Refining spirit liquids and purifying lights is, at its most basic level, simply following a formula to its completion. This will allow these numerous materials to combine perfectly by relying on their unique characteristics, and to get rid of impurities. The final result will be these tempering treasures.\"Yan Lingqing picked up a crystal bottle that contained a blue flower. The surface of the flower was constantly rippling and diffusing some sort of energy. \"This is a Three Leaved Algal Bloom.\" As she spoke, her slender, jade hand lightly shook the bottle and surprisingly, the flower instantly disintegrated into dust. At the same time, Li Luo was able to see water resonance power emitted from Yan Lingqing, which she then guided directly into the crystal bottle, directly fusing with the remnants of the flower.\"During the process of refinement, we have to utilize either water or light resonance power to fuse with the materials. This allows us to amplify the unique characteristics of these items. One has to be extremely careful with the strength of the resonance power. Too much and it will ruin the material, too little and the refinement process will also fail.\"Her water resonance power continued to pour into the crystal bottle, and just a brief moment later, one was able to see that the material had gradually fused together to form a dark-blue liquid.Immediately after, Yan Lingqing proceeded to follow a set of predetermined steps. She quickly blended over ten other materials in a special sequence flawlessly and effortlessly, evidence of her familiarity with the subject.Half an hour later, the materials and liquid were mixed together. However, things were not as simple as that as the two items seemed to be repelling each other, even to the point of boiling over and causing an explosion.\"What happens next is the final and also most important step. In order to fuse these two sets of materials together, a certain sort of power is required. This power will ultimately influence the tempering strength of the spirit liquids and purifying lights, and it is the most critical aspect of the refinement process. This power is often referred to as watersource or lightsource. In simpler terms, this is the result of when one condenses one's water resonance power or light resonance power to its utmost.\" Yan Lingqing then pulled out a rhombus-shaped crystal stone with a crystal jar hanging under it.Her palm was tightly grasping this crystal stone while more blue resonant power was surging out and into it. Ripples could be seen below the stone's surface as it vibrated. A moment later, Li Luo was able to see a single dark-blue drop of liquid gradually dripping from the bottom of the stone, falling into the crystal jar.\"This is a polymerization crystal. Its use is to condense one's resonant power into watersource.\" Yan Lingqing explained right as she directed the watersource into the crystal bottle in which the materials were boiling over. At this point, a wondrous scene unfolded and the chaotic display of the seemingly incompatible materials repelling each other completely vanished. Then a bright, blue light was emitted from within.A single spirit liquid had been refined.Li Luo stared at the liquid, which was radiating blue light, and sighed in praise.\"This is just a single first-grade spirit liquid. Hence, the process is extremely simple and not exceptionally troublesome,\" Yan Lingqing casually said. She was, after all, a fourth-grade resonance artificer, so such a process could be done on a whim.However, Li Luo was extremely cognizant of the fact that despite everything having gone smoothly, as easily as breathing, this was only possible due to the foundation built from countless failures. Even he could understand this as someone with a foundational understanding of resonance artificering.Li Luo gazed at the spirit liquid and asked directly, \"Since watersource and lightsource can determine the final tempering strength of the spirit liquids and purifying lights, what determines the quality of the watersource itself?\"Yan Lingqing indifferently replied, \"The quality of the watersource or lightsource is dependent on one's resonance grade. The higher the grade of the resonance, the higher the quality of the watersource or lightsource produced. Hence, an individual with a high-grade water resonance or light resonance will naturally become a better resonance artificer than an average individual. For example, if Jiang Qing'e were to become a resonance artificer, the tempering strength of her spirit liquids and purifying lights would vastly outstrip most individuals. It's simply a pity that she is completely uninterested in this. Even the Resonance Tempering Hall spent a whole year beseeching her to pick up the fundamentals, but to no avail...\"Li Luo nodded. Jiang Qing'e had a rarely-seen ninth-grade light resonance, truly someone favored by the heavens. It truly was unfortunate that she had no interest whatsoever in resonance artificering.\"What if she were to create some high-grade lightsource for me to utilize? Would it improve the tempering strength of the spirit liquids and purifying lights the Suncreek Villa creates?\"Yan Lingqing shook her head. \"It wouldn't work even if two people with similar resonances and grades created two lightsources of completely imperceptible but different characteristics. For example, the materials I have been refining for half a day have already fused with my resonant power. If someone else were to utilize their watersource to complete the refinement, it would cause a conflict and the refinement would certainly fail. However, there are specific secret arts in this world that allow one to condense a special sort of watersource or lightsource that can further improve the tempering strength of spirit liquids and purifying lights. These are known as secret art watersources or lightsources. This is the hidden ace of numerous powers, but our Suncreek Villa does not possess it.\"Li Luo looked pensive as he listened. He was born with a blank palace and eventually refined an acquired resonance. Most importantly, the blank attribute of his palace had remained, and it allowed him to utilize spirit liquids and purifying lights without limits. His watersource should also correspondingly possess a portion of this blank attribute. Would it be of use to him as a resonance artificer?His waterlight resonance was of the fifth-grade and had the additional attribute of light. The resulting spirit liquid created by him might not be as simple as expected.Li Luo had confidence that if he were to use his waterlight resonance to refine a spirit liquid and purifying light, the result would not be inferior to one refined by someone with a seventh-grade water or light resonance.In fact, one would rarely even see a seventh-grade water or light resonance resonance artificer.Most importantly, there was no rush. He would take his time to experiment once he embarked on his journey to be a resonance artificer.As Li Luo was still pondering the numerous implications of his resonance, Yan Lingqing wiped her glasses. \"If you truly want to become a resonance artificer, come here whenever you're free every day. I will teach you the basics, and when you're able to refine a first-grade spirit liquid or purifying light by yourself, you will officially be a first-grade resonance artificer.\"\"Then I would sincerely like to thank Elder Sister Lingqing for this.\" He had achieved his goal today and he couldn't help but smile exuberantly, truly thanking her for her guidance.Yan Lingqing coolly waved him off and put on her long robe, dragging Cai Wei out of her workshop.....During the next period of time, Li Luo's life became even more fruitful and strict.During the day, he would learn in Southwind Academy. After which, he would cultivate in the skygold room in the old manor, followed by some resonance art practice. Lastly, he would head to the Suncreek Villa and, under the guidance of Yan Lingqing, learn the arts of a resonance artificer.Whilst all of this was happening, Cai Wei was purchasing fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. The moment they reached his hands, he would spend some time tempering his resonance.Time passed extremely quickly, and Li Luo could feel that he was growing stronger as each day went by.It wasn't until the day before the preliminary examinations that Li Luo finally reached the Sixth Seal Stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0026\u2013 An Ordinary Preliminary ExaminationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySouthwind Academy was bustling with activity on this day. The atmosphere seemed to be fired up as everyone geared up for the preliminary examinations.This preliminary examination was basically a qualifying round. Only the surviving twenty individuals would be able to represent Southwind Academy in the final examinations.The Academy Final Examinations, as they were also known as, was a gathering of all the academies in the Tianshu Province in which they would engage in rounds of battles. All of this was part of the selection for the Astral Sage College's strict entry requirements.This was also to say that only by passing through this qualifying round and entering the top twenty would one have the right to struggle for a place within the Astral Sage College.Of course, many students also understood that the Astral Sage College was a goal that was simply too lofty. If they were able to perform outstandingly during the final examinations, they would still be able to attend a respectable college in the Xia Kingdom.Although these other colleges and institutions were not as famous, as large in scale, or as strong as the Astral Sage College, they were still viable paths for one's future.Hence, this final examination was the final chance for the students to demonstrate their capabilities.At Southwind Academy's central training field.The entire place was swarmed with a sea of people. There were tens of rings that had been constructed to serve as the competition fields. The rules were also quite simple: one competitor had to be knocked out of the field or forced to forfeit before the time limit was over to be considered a victory.When Li Luo and Zhao Kuo arrived in the area, they were shocked at the hustle and bustle.\"Hmph! It truly seems a little noisy.\" Zhao Kuo laughed.\"Although this is considered a qualifying round, to the vast majority of the students here, this is also their final chance to demonstrate their capabilities,\" Li Luo replied.Zhao Kuo nodded as he scratched his head with a melancholic expression on his face. \"I don't even know if I qualify to enter the top 20.\" With Li Luo's sudden rise, Zhao Kuo was now considered to be the second strongest within the Second School. Looking at Southwind Academy as a whole, his chances of entering the top 20 were not small. However, this also required a little bit of luck. If he were to successively encounter individuals that were stronger than him, his overall record would also be tarnished and he might very well be eliminated.\"Everything is up to Lady Luck. Well, luck is something that's innate, and from the looks of things, you might not survive a few bouts after all,\" Li Luo casually quipped as he looked around.Zhao Kuo's face turned green as he scolded, \"You bastard! I curse that you encounter Lu Qing'er in the very first round!\"\"No you.\"\"No youuuuuu!!!!\"Whilst the two bickered freely, an ear-piercing announcement echoed out from a platform overlooking the field. Everyone's attention shifted to it, and they could see Dean Wei walking out with the rest of the teachers following behind.\"Good morning, students. The preliminary examinations are about to start. I hope that all of you here will do your utmost and display your strongest state. The ranking today will influence your future. The examinations will last three day and the results of these battles can be seen on the stone pillars situated in the four directions of the field. I will not speak any more unnecessary words and hereby announce the start of the preliminary examinations!\"As the words resounded around the field, the shouts and excitement became even more intense and palpable.Li Luo and Zhao Kuo, on the other hand, had made their way to a stone pillar. On the stone pillar hung a projection crystal. Large amounts of information was scrolling through it as they read it.After half a minute, they discovered their opponents for the day.Zhao Kuo immediately heaved a sigh of relief. The two opponents he would be facing did not exceed his expectations. This was sufficient for him.Li Luo's expression was also indifferent. His two opponents were both from the First School, but they were not even as strong as Bei Kun.This, however, was normal. Southwind Academy had almost a thousand students. What were the odds of him encountering a metal plate that was ripe for the kicking so quickly?On the contrary, Zhao Kuo and him were considered to be the metal plates that no one wanted to encounter.\"It's almost my turn. I will go and prepare myself. All the best!\" Zhao Kuo looked at the time and said goodbye to Li Luo, excitedly tunneling into the mass of humans and disappearing in a flash.Li Luo shook his head as he made his way to his own battle stage. His first round was also about to begin.After reaching his assigned battle stage, Li Luo waited for around half an hour until the administrators announced his name, directly jumping atop in a single motion.Li Luo's appearance had also attracted the attention of the people around. Furthermore, he had previously beaten Bei Kun and his two friends in one go. He had once again regained a certain level of prestige.However, not everyone had witnessed that battle personally, soi they continued to hold Li Luo in contempt, thinking that his display of prowess was a mere exaggerated tale. Now that Li Luo was actually on the field, they would personally get to knock him down to size.Li Luo's opponent was a skinny youth at the Sixth Seal Stage. His expression was a little bitter as he was considered to be average even amongst the Sixth Seal cultivators of Southwind Academy. Although this wasn't bad, who would ever have expected him to be so unlucky as to encounter Li Luo in the first round?Furthermore, Li Luo had manifested a resonance and was ascending towards the skies!\"Begin.\" Once the administrator saw that both parties had entered the battle stage, he gave the command to start.The skinny youth did not hesitate to rouse all of the resonant power within him. At the same time, he quickly assumed a defensive position, clearly planning to react to Li Luo's move instead of taking the initiative.Li Luo did not hesitate either. Blue resonant power akin to massive tides of water surged out and circulated around him.He dashed out like a bolt of lightning, executing an explosive resonance art.The battle ended much quicker than anyone had expected.In just the short span of a few minutes, Li Luo's tempestuous assault rained down upon that skinny youth. His defense shattered instantly and he could only choose to resign.Hua!The people surrounding the battle stage burst into an uproar. Numerous horrified gazes were levied at Li Luo, especially from those at the Sixth Seal Stage, their expressions grave and sunken. They could not tell how Li Luo could have gained such explosive power in such a short period of time. It seemed as though even Bei Kun would be inferior in this regard.Li Luo was unconcerned with the looks he received from the audience. Once the administrator declared his victory, he jumped off the stage and disappeared amongst the crowd.Li Luo's second match was not long after, and it was even more relaxed than the first. His opponent was completely dispirited and did not even wish to fight, directly conceding.Hence, Li Luo's first day was a complete victory.After finishing the battles, Li Luo made preparations to leave. He had to rush to the Suncreek Villa to continue his learning of resonance smithing. After undergoing this period of practice, he could gradually feel that he was about to successfully create a first-grade spirit liquid.Right as he weaved through the crowd, Li Luo could sense someone in front of him looking directly at him. It was Lu Qing'er.She was currently wearing white, body-fitting practice robes. Her long legs were slender and accentuated by the robes whilst it snugly wrapped around her perfect waist. Her long hair was also tied up in a ponytail that was let down elegantly. All of this gave rise to a scene so beautiful that one could only sigh wistfully when seeing her.However, when Li Luo saw her, he could only give a helpless smile and a greeting. \"Have you finished your bouts for today? It shouldn't have been too hard.\" These words were all crap. Lu Qing'er was number one in Southwind Academy. Anyone who encountered her would probably directly forfeit.Lu Qing'er sized up Li Luo and replied, \"It looks like you've grown stronger again. So where do you think you rank in this preliminary examination?\"\"I should be able to enter the top 20. Being able to participate in the final examinations will be sufficient.\" He casually smiled.He was sincerely disinterested in competing for the highest position he could. There was no need to do so, as a higher rank wouldn't bring about any benefits. In fact, if his ranking was too high, he might even be specially targeted by other academies.When Lu Qing'er heard his words, she frowned. \"With your strength, I feel that reaching the top ten isn't impossible.\"\"Do you really think so highly of me?\" Li Luo laughed.\"Li Luo, I feel that you have no need to hide your strength so deeply. Only by fully demonstrating your capabilities will you be able to make those who doubt you shut up.\"Li Luo felt a little helpless at these words. Lu Qing'er might seem like an elegant and graceful lady, but her personality was one that only sought greater strength. Perhaps this was also why she kept tabs on him. After all, he was the only one who had the ability to suppress her in the past. Thus, she held a special interest in him.Completely opposite of her, Li Luo's personality was not the flamboyant sort. If there was no need to do so, he would not burst forth with his full capabilities for everyone to see.Perhaps this was a habit that he had unknowingly picked up as a form of self-protection after his fall from grace.\"I understand. I will do my best.\" Lu Qing'er did not have any bad intentions when she mentioned all this. Hence, Li Luo could only nod and agree with her before quickly finding an excuse to slink away.Lu Qing'er continued to watch his back as he left, also feeling slightly helpless before turning to leave in the other direction.As the two left, neither had noticed that on a battle stage not too far away was a pair of stalking eyes. A certain Song Yunfeng had been observing the two after an utterly ruinous battle.His gaze was fixated upon the direction Li Luo had left in, completely immersed in gloominess.\"I clearly warned you... but still you wish to challenge me?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This period of studying the resonance artificering arts had truly developed his interest in this matter.\"Haha. The Young Lord has truly been diligent in coming to the Suncreek Villa for these past few weeks.\" Just as Li Luo was in the midst of pondering how he could best refine a first-grade spirit liquid, he was dragged out of his daze by a certain laugh.Turning his head to look, he noticed Vice President Zhuang Yi beaming right at him.\"I heard that the Young Lord has manifested a fifth-grade water resonance,\" Zhuang Yi said curiously.Li Luo had already spent many days practicing the tempering arts, so the news of him possessing a fifth-grade water resonance had already started to spread.Li Luo closely observed this Vice President who had thrown his lot in with Pei Hao, gently nodding. \"Indeed, I'm currently learning the tempering arts from Elder Sister Lingqing.\"Zhuang Yi continued to smile. \"Vice President Yan is a genius of the Astral Sage College. Her abilities truly aren't bad. However, her experience has some limitations. If the Young Lord wishes to learn the tempering arts, your humble servant may not be talented, but I believe I can provide some constructive advice.\"Li Luo smiled upon hearing this. This Zhuang Yi truly seemed to be big-hearted with those words. However, even an idiot would know that he was trying to closely monitor Li Luo and then personally report the news to Pei Hao. Would he even sincerely guide him?The choice was obvious if he had to choose between Jiang Qing'e's best friend and a lackey of Pei Hao. There was no hesitation.Hence, he lightly shook his head. \"I feel that Elder Sister Lingqing isn't bad. Perhaps when I do have unanswered questions, I will personally look for Vice President Zhuang.\"\"Ah, that really is a shame.\" Zhuang Yi gave an emotional sigh as though he felt that this was truly unfortunate.Li Luo did not continue to speak and was about to leave before he suddenly recalled something and turned back. \"Oh, yes, Vice President Zhuang, I do have a question. I've heard from Elder Sister Lingqing that some of her refining workshops do lack specific materials from time to time. In fact, I heard that you're in charge of procuring more materials. Would you be able to replenish the stock?\"Upon hearing the request, Zhuang Yi frowned slightly before responding in a troubled tone, \"Young Lord, this is unfortunately something I cannot assist with. There are times when the materials we purchase encounter some quality issues and thus shortages do occur from time to time. Since the Young Lord has raised this concern, I will pay greater attention to it.\" Facing Zhuang Yi's respectful tone and the seemingly reasonable, watertight excuse, Li Luo did not push the matter but gave him a deep look before turning to leave.Zhuang Yi, on the other hand, continued to observe Li Luo as he left, the smile on his face gradually disappearing.At Zhuang Yi's side was a lackey who softly said, \"Vice President, it's truly unexpected that the Young Lord has manifested a fifth-grade resonance. This is truly shocking...\"\"It must have been a heavenly treasure left behind by the two House Lords. It truly is a waste to lavish such an expense on a wastrel,\" Zhuang Yi indifferently commented.\"However, it is just a fifth-grade resonance. It's not exceptional and it won't be so simple for the Young Lord to re-emerge as a contender for the house.\" Waving his hand, he ordered, \"Bring this news to Young Master Pei Hao. Furthermore, let's expedite the confiscation of the first-grade refining workshops. That bitch Yan Lingqing is truly an eyesore.\"\"Yes, my liege.\".......................Li Luo had just entered a first-grade refining workshop. Numerous compartments with crystal walls as barriers divided the room, with each compartment possessing an individual hard at work.Furthermore, Li Luo noticed the tall and slender Yan Lingqing walking around, in her long robe and both hands in her pockets. Her expression was clearly icy as she patrolled the area.She then paused in front of a particular compartment, unenthusiastically observing a particular first-grade resonance artificer's refining process.Being directly observed by Yan Lingqing caused the resonance artificer to feel a little nervous. He quickly drew out a thin crystal needle engraved with a precise measuring scale.This was a tempering measurement needle with a simple function. It was used to check the tempering strength of a completed spirit liquid or purifying light.The crystal needle dipped into the liquid within the crystal bottle and then the measurement scale gradually lit up increasingly.In the end, it settled at the 46% mark.Yan Lingqing saw this and coldly commented, \"If this sort of spirit liquid and purifying light were taken out for sale, it would only ruin the Suncreek Villa's reputation.\" The resonance artificer could only dejectedly lower his head.Yan Lingqing did not become softhearted at this display of remorse, only continuing to mercilessly tear into him. \"Your previous refinement had no less than four errors. The White Leaved Fruit was not refined with sufficient heat control, the Moonlight Juice used was too thick, the Smokeless Water was too thin, and most importantly, at the final step, your water resonance power did not attain the minimum saturation requirements.\"Refine it again.\"After which, she turned and immediately swept her gaze across all of the first-grade resonance artificers. Everyone was silent out of fear, burrowing their heads into their work and focusing on refinement.Yan Lingqing carefully wiped her glasses, her beautiful face remaining as chilly as ever. It was clear that the results of this first-grade resonance artificer were not up to standard.A trace of gloominess could be seen in her pupils. Although she had come at the behest of Jiang Qing'e, she had come in without any assistance, and her influence within this branch could be considered to be even less than Zhuang Yi's.Within this branch of the Suncreek Villa, there were three refining workshops. They were split into first, second, and third-grades. Different graded refining workshops were thus responsible for the refinement of different grades of spirit liquids and purifying lights.Upon receiving Jiang Qing'e's order, Yan Lingqing had taken over the first-grade and second-grade refining workshops. However, the third-grade workshop remained firmly within Zhuang Yi's grasp.The two parties had, as a result, clashed multiple times both openly and secretly for the control of these refining workshops. Whoever controlled these workshops would indirectly control the majority of the resonance artificers. As the Suncreek Villa existed to refine spirit liquids and purifying lights, resonance artificers were the most important resource available.However, Zhuang Yi seemed to be unable to sit still any further in recent days. He had started to make moves on the first-grade refining workshop. His reason was that he had managed to raise a disciple that could refine a 56% tempering strength first-grade spirit liquid.This would be the highest tempering strength available in the Suncreek Villa's first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. Hence, with this reason, Zhuang Yi spread rumors that Yan Lingqing was unable to guide the first-grade resonance artificers effectively by extension and was not a good fit to be in control. In fact, in recent days, there were signs that some of the first-grade resonance artificers were slightly moved by this rationale.Yan Lingqing could faintly feel that if things were to proceed this way, control of the first-grade refining workshop would be seized by Zhuang Yi.Although she possessed the backing of Jiang Qing'e and Cai Wei, Zhuang Yi was not doing anything wrong on the surface. They were unwilling to directly boot this old man from the Suncreek Villa when he had yet to do anything wrong, as this would also be bad for morale. Such an action would also cause chaos to ensue within the management of the Suncreek Villa and would ultimately affect the amount of refined spirit liquids and purifying lights. In the end, House Luolan would end up being the loser.Her heart was slightly disgruntled and in turmoil as she proceeded to walk into Li Luo's refining workshop. She gave a quick glance and did not say anything.Li Luo was also very casual as he strode into an empty refining compartment. Beside him, a gorgeous young lady softly said to him, \"You're back, Young Lord.\" Li Luo smiled as he nodded and proceeded to tidy up the materials on the refining platform. He also softly replied, \"Sister Yinghua, why does it seem like Vice President Yan's mood isn't that great?\"The young lady who was addressed as Sister Yinghua stuck out a tongue at him in response. \"We've all been scolded for an entire afternoon now....\" \u00a0Then she gave him the rundown of the current state of things.After Li Luo heard all this, he finally understood that everything was for control of the first-grade refining workshop. This was indeed no small matter. If Zhuang Yi were able to take control of it, it would also be a massive blow to Yan Lingqing's influence and prestige. Her position in the Suncreek Villa would only shrink from that point on.Li Luo frowned as he didn't want to see such a sight. Furthermore, the Suncreek Villa was a large portion of House Luolan's Tianshu Province income, almost half of it. At a point where he required large amounts of capital, he did not want such a complication to arise, as it would affect him significantly.Most importantly, Zhuang Yi was Pei Hao's lackey. With his personality, the entire Suncreek Villa might even be completely swallowed by that white-eyed wolf.However, all these thoughts were pointless now. Li Luo could only focus on what was ahead of him. The formula for the first-grade Azure Jade Spirit Liquid was on the platform in front of him as he prepared the materials, beginning his practice for the day.Two hours of practice went by quickly, and just as Li Luo was getting more familiar with the refinement process, the large doors to the first-grade refining workshop had suddenly been pushed open. Everyone halted in their tasks as they glanced over towards Zhuang Yi and his minions who had just barged in.Merely looking at the way they had busted their way in, one could tell that they had ill intentions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Surprised gazes were cast in their direction.Yan Lingqing had also noticed their entry. Her face downcast, she icily demanded, \"Vice President Zhuang Yi, how can you act so rudely?\"Zhuang Yi's face was full of smiles as he replied, \"Vice President Yan, there is no need to be agitated. I'm here for the issue we raised previously. Ever since the first-grade refining workshop was placed under your command, the amount of spirit liquids and purifying lights produced have decreased. Furthermore, there have been numerous pieces that are not up to par. This has severely affected the Suncreek Villa's business.\" Zhuang Yi looked deeply worried and even sick at heart at this point.Yan Lingqing coldly retorted, \"A reduction in production? Aren't you most clear on why this is the case? If you had not reduced the amount of materials provided, how could this have happened?\"\"Vice President Yan, you are slandering my good name! We have been lacking materials recently, how could I just create more from nothing? Even though Vice President Yan is from the Astral Sage College, you might be lacking some experience and your guidance might not be appropriate for the Suncreek Villa's first-grade resonance artificers. Your pointers might instead mislead them,\" Zhuang Yi said with a frown on his face.No one dared to interfere in this war of words within the first-grade refining workshop. Everyone understood that this was an open battle between the two vice presidents, and anyone who dared speak out of turn would inevitably be turned into dust by the aftershocks.Zhuang Yi continued to stare at Yan Lingqing. \"Vice President Yan, as resonance artificers, we should use results to back our words. You've already been in control of the first-grade refining workshop for quite some time, but the results clearly haven't been exemplary. The first-grade resonance artificers you have guided are only able to produce first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights that barely exceed 50% tempering strength. On the other hand, my disciple, Shi Yun, is already able to refine a 56% tempering strength Azure Jade Spirit Liquid. You have to know that the minimum requirement for the Suncreek Villa's first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights is 53% tempering strength. Thus, Vice President Yan should act for the good of the Suncreek Villa. I'd recommend you hand the first-grade refining workshop over to me; otherwise, if things proceed this way, our first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights might no longer have a market in the Tianshu Province.\"After speaking, Zhuang Yi turned to face a few of the higher-ups of this branch of the Suncreek Villa. \"Don't you feel that what I'm saying makes sense?\"These higher-ups remained deep in thought. Even though they did not wish to involve themselves in this scuffle between the two, Zhuang Yi's words made a lot of sense, and as an organization, only results mattered.If Zhuang Yi's disciple was able to reliably produce 56% tempering strength spirit liquids and purifying lights, this would indeed be beneficial to all.Hence, some of the higher ups reluctantly spoke out. \"Vice President Yan, why don't you let Shi Yun manage the first-grade refining workshop? This way, you can focus on the second-grade refining workshop. Furthermore, this is our Suncreek Villa's most important product.\"Yan Lingqing was emotionless. If she truly gave way here, this would mean that she had lost in the battle against Zhuang Yi and would clearly indicate that the direction of the winds would blow against her. Gradually, she would be forced back more and more.However, if she did not take a step back here, with how aggressive Zhuang Yi was and with the voice of reason on his side, this would also cause a negative blowback on her end.Thus it truly seemed as though she was stuck between a rock and a hard place.Zhuang Yi stared with interest at the clearly conflicted Yan Lingqing, a smirk gradually forming on his face. So what if she was a genius of the Astral Sage College, was she not still tender and fresh-faced?Weng!At this point in time, as the pressure on Yan Lingqing was multiplying, the tense atmosphere was shattered by a blue light exploding forth from a specific refining compartment.This sudden change of events caused everyone some degree of astonishment. Everyone turned around, only to see a certain Li Luo grasping a bottle filled with an azure liquid and an expression full of glee.This was the first successful spirit liquid he had ever produced, and it had been refined under such tenuous circumstances.After refining this bottle of Azure Jade Spirit Liquid, Li Luo drew out a tempering measurement needle and tested it.Surprisingly, he saw the measurement scale on the needle swiftly climb upwards.Ultimately, the needle stopped at the 60% tempering strength mark.Hua!When all of the first-grade resonance artificers saw this sight, they couldn't help exclaiming in shock!One after another, everyone rushed forward to take a look. \"60% tempering strength? The spirit liquid that the Young Lord refined has a tempering strength of 60%!\"\"How can this be possible?!\" The first-grade refining workshop was filled with cries of disbelief and terror! No one could understand how this was possible, and all the attention that had been focused on the battle between Zhuang Yi and Yan Lingqing dissipated. Everyone rushed towards Li Luo to take a closer look.After everyone had a chance to lay eyes on the tempering measurement needle's scale, there was a deathly silence. All of their shocked gazes were directed at the smug Li Luo.They were well aware that he had been learning resonance artificering arts for no more than two weeks! Within such a short span of time, he had managed to not only produce a first-grade spirit liquid, but also produce one with such terrifying tempering strength.Was this truly what one called a blessed genius of the heavens?\"Make way.\" Yan Lingqing's voice caused the group to disperse quickly as she strode over with her long, slender legs. Her alluring gaze was purely focused on the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid in Li Luo's hand.\"Let me take a look,\" she instructed.Li Luo naturally made way and passed the crystal bottle over. Yan Lingqing then quickly poured out a drop of the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid to check it personally. Her face seemed a little moved at this sight. \"This Azure Jade Spirit Liquid has unmatched purity. It's clearly able to reach the point of 60% tempering strength.\"She then shifted her focus onto Li Luo. She never would've expected Li Luo to also be a true genius at resonance artificering.This was also his first attempt!Recalling the first time she refined Azure Jade Spirit Liquid, the finished product only had 57% tempering strength, which clearly wasn't a bad result.At this point, she seemed to think of something, and a cunning smile appeared on her cold face. She grabbed the bottle containing the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid and turned around, looking at the equally surprised Zhuang Yi. \"Vice President Zhuang Yi, I don't believe I will hand over the reins of the first-grade refining workshop just yet.\"Zhuang Yi's face turned incomparably dark as he scowled at the bottle of spirit liquid. He had clearly heard everyone's exclamations. This brat Li Luo had managed to refine a 60% tempering strength spirit liquid?If he or Yan Lingqing, fourth-grade resonance artificers, were to take action personally, the first-grade Azure Jade Spirit Liquid would likely only reach the 65% tempering strength mark. Based on his memory, he had not personally refined a first-grade spirit liquid or purifying light in numerous years as such a task was a waste of his time. It was inefficient to do so, and it would fetch perhaps only tens of skygold.This was the first time he had heard of someone managing to create a spirit liquid with a 60% tempering strength on their first try. His disciple, Shi Yun, had spent an entire year polishing his craft before managing to reach a tempering strength of 56%.The difference between the two was like comparing mud to the clouds.Zhuang Yi's mouth twitched a bit before he stiffly answered, \"Vice President Yan, did you perhaps utilize some underhanded means? The Young Lord here has barely touched upon the realm of resonance artificering. As I recall, he only started two weeks ago.\"Yan Lingqing indifferently glanced at him. \"I'm sure everyone here observed the Young Lord personally refining this. Your excuse seems a little too shameless, no? Perhaps you'd like the Young Lord to personally demonstrate his skill to you?\" There were numerous individuals around who nodded in agreement. They had clearly seen Li Luo personally refining this spirit liquid.Zhuang Yi's expression stiffened further as he forced himself to dryly laugh. \"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare!\" Although he did not respect Li Luo in his heart, this was still the Young Lord. How could he dare to take him lightly in front of everyone?\"Vice President Zhuang Yi, if I were to refine a first-grade spirit liquid with an even higher tempering strength, do you think that would give me the right to be the supervisor of the first-grade refining workshop?\" Li Luo smiled as he dealt yet another blow to Zhuang Yi.Zhuang Yi gave a ridiculing smile. \"We would have to defer to Vice President Yan's opinion on this.\"He also understood that today's attempt had resulted in a disastrous failure. Thus, he quickly gave some conciliatory words before turning around to leave quickly with a depressed expression on his face.The atmosphere finally cooled down in the first-grade refining workshop. Following which, numerous congratulatory words came in from all around and everyone began to look at Li Luo with newfound envy and fervor.Li Luo gladly accepted the compliments before swiftly rushing off to continue his practice. A certain alluring gaze continued to focus on Li Luo as he made his way. \"Who would have thought that his first attempt would result in a spirit liquid with such high tempering strength. It looks like you are truly a genius when it comes to resonance artificering.\"At the Astral Sage College, Yan Lingqing had seen numerous geniuses, but this was the first time she had seemed someone with so much natural talent. What she found most unexpected was that Li Luo's water resonance was only at the fifth-grade, so what did that mean? This meant that Li Luo possessed a natural affinity and sensitivity towards fusing and harmonizing the characteristics of these materials. This was something innate, and only certain geniuses in the Resonance Tempering Hall of the Astral Sage College possessed such ability.\"Perhaps this was all luck as well,\" Li Luo wistfully suggested. If he knew how highly Yan Lingqing regarded him, he would have definitely felt extremely awkward. He truly didn't possess this so-called genius. The reason why his first spirit liquid ever had a 60% tempering strength was due to him relying on his waterlight resonance's unique characteristics when it came to refining spirit liquids. When the result was produced, he noticed he had underestimated the impact the water resonance power and light resonance power had on fusing the final product.Yan Lingqing was disinterested in his thoughts. \"It was lucky that you were around this time. I will not bother with superfluous thanks, and the Suncreek Villa's profits technically all go to you so nothing more needs to be said.\" She immediately paused after saying all this, and a smile bloomed on her snowy face.\"However, my mood isn't bad. I will treat you to a meal tonight, then!\"Li Luo originally wanted to reject her offer as he wished to rush back home to practice his resonance arts... but upon thinking about how strict Yan Lingqing usually was, his survival instincts kicked in and he immediately gave the most radiant smile he possibly could and agreed almost instantly\u2026\"Well then... nothing could please me more!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lanterns were lit up all around, heralding the hustle and bustle of nightlife as the chilly wind blew past.\"Your performance today wasn't bad! It truly helped me out of a pinch! Down this cup!\"In a winehouse facing the street, Yan Lingqing was grabbing a cup of wine and shrieking. Her usual cool and collected demeanor had turned into a rarely seen heroic and unrestrained temperament thanks to the assistance of liquid courage.Li Luo was also a little stupefied at this sudden change of events. Helpless, he could only gently clink cups and then stare in shock as Yan Lingqing downed the entire cup, which was the size of half her face, in a single breath.This way of drinking seemed to run completely contrary to Yan Lingqing's bespectacled and cold appearance. It was a complete change in personality!Similarly, numerous gazes within the winehouse had sneakily shifted towards them as Yan Lingqing truly was quite an attractive individual.\"Elder Sister Lingqing, you don't have to say more. Ultimately, I'm just protecting my spending money...\" Li Luo laughed.\"Perhaps that might be true. But that bastard Zhuang Yi, always waving around those 'qualifications' of his around me... I've suffered more than a few times thanks to him... \u00a0I've never seen eye to eye with him.\" Yan Lingqing let loose.At the same time, she continued sizing Li Luo up. \"However, you've truly amazed me, and now I have a whole new level of respect for you. I had always thought that this Young Lord was just some sort of mascot!\" Li Luo was a little embarrassed upon hearing those words. Wasn't she being a little too honest?Not wasting any time, Yan Lingqing refilled her large cup and continued, \"Frankly speaking, there's still a huge gap between you and Jiang Qing'e.\"\"That is to be expected...\" Li Luo honestly admitted. Jiang Qing'e was exceptional, so much so that even the Astral Sage College was merely another stepping stone to her. This sort of honor was something even the prince of the royal family would not be able to receive.\"Though I will continue to struggle and work hard.\" Li Luo stared at his wine cup and smiled.Yan Lingqing playfully retorted, \"Oh? It sounds like you truly have a thing for Jiang Qing'e.\"\"Sister Qing'e's excellence does not need to be elaborated on. If I said I never had any funny ideas about her, I'm afraid even you wouldn't believe me,\" Li Luo said honestly.He had been with Jiang Qing'e for many years, and their relationship and feelings had naturally become more and more complex. Adding fuel to the flames was the marriage agreement, and from Li Luo's perspective, the two had become deeply intertwined.Li Luo was sure that this feeling was not exclusive to him but also extended to Jiang Qing'e. It was impossible for her to treat him as an ordinary person, and this was something that Li Luo could sense after being with her for so long.\"How honest.\" Yan Lingqing downed yet another cup of strong wine. Nodding her head, she gave a smile with a deeper meaning. \"If you truly have these sorts of thoughts, then you have a long way to go. You're currently still in the City of Southwind despite all this. Perhaps when you enter the Astral Sage College one day, you will realize how frightening your opponents are.\"Li Luo grasped his wine cup, feeling slightly dejected as he thought of how to reply. \"Well... I'm still Jiang Qing'e's husband-to-be.\" Pausing slightly, he chuckled. \"If anyone truly wants to harm me, they'd still have to go through Sister Qing'e. I think that when that happens, the ones who will find it most unbearable will be those opponents themselves.\"Yan Lingqing's beautiful pupils widened a little at this statement, and she glared at Li Luo. \"Wait... aren't you just hiding behind your woman?\"Li Luo replied with conviction and sincerity, \"Isn't it the duty of the bride to protect the groom? What's wrong with that!? Huh?\"Yan Lingqing, who was slightly taken aback, couldn't help but exclaim, \"You... that's going too far!\" Immediately after, she burst into laughter as she understood Jiang Qing'e's personality best. She truly would do such a thing and treat these competitors as pieces of meat, a double blow to their ego and prestige.Li Luo smiled as he refilled her cup, the two continuing to drink. Towards the end, as he felt his head starting to spin, he noticed that Yan Lingqing had already collapsed atop the table.Li Luo could finally sigh a heave of relief. He shook Yan Lingqing gently and realized she was completely unresponsive, leaving him speechless.In the end, he lifted her up with one hand on her slender waist and the other on her knees, gradually carrying her away.As Li Luo carried Yan Lingqing out of the winehouse, numerous envious gazes were trained upon him!However, he did not possess their vile thoughts. He quickly flagged a carriage over and a then certain lady then came out to receive them.This was something previously arranged by Yan Lingqing as she knew that she'd definitely go big before she went home.Li Luo carefully lifted Yan Lingqing into the carriage before informing the attendant, \"Please take Vice President Yan home.\"The female attendant respectfully nodded and then proceeded to guide the carriage away.On the streets, Li Luo watched as the carriage was bathed by the numerous lights within the city. He stretched lazily as he recollected the conversation he had with Yan Lingqing, eventually smiling wryly.\"I guess I have to work harder.\" Although he didn't mind having Jiang Qing'e protect him, he couldn't be a stain on her reputation either, right?As he turned to leave, within the swiftly leaving carriage, the originally drunk Yan Lingqing suddenly opened her eyes.As she lazily lay within the carriage, she murmured to herself, \"Not bad indeed. He clearly didn't try to take advantage of me. When I get back, I have to let Qing'e know that while her little husband is not very strong, he is definitely someone that this elder sister recognizes!\"....When Li Luo woke up the next day, he could feel a pounding pain in his head. Feeling completely helpless, he made a mental note to reject any more drinking excursions with Yan Lingqing.After hastily cleaning up, he made his way to the front hall, where he spotted the charming and alluring Elder Sister Cai Wei waiting for him for breakfast.Li Luo gave an apologetic smile at this point\u2026\"Did you have a few drinks with Yan Lingqing last night?\" Cai Wei grinned as she passed him a bowl of porridge.Li Luo nodded. \"Who would have expected Elder Sister Lingqing to drink so... heroically?\"\"Lingqing truly is too much. You're just a child. Why did she take you out for drinks?\" Cai Wei chided.Upon hearing this, Li Luo felt dissatisfied. \"Elder Sister Cai Wei, don't take advantage of my youth! Aren't you only a little older than me? You almost sound like my mom.\"Cai Wei glared at him before she praised, \"I heard of what happened at the Suncreek Villa yesterday. You're not bad! You've finally reached a point where you can assist us in the bigger picture. I've also taken the opportunity to dispose of some of our more useless assets in the Tianshu Province. I've even provided a bargain for the Difa family and the Bei family. Hahaha. I heard that the Song family tried to discuss some new terms with the other two families, but to no avail. They stonewalled the Song family and said that this wasn't part of the deal. This has created friction and made it more difficult for them to reach a consensus when it comes to dealing with House Luolan. Now that we have gotten rid of some of these burdens, our coffers have been replenished and we should be able to complete your requested purchase smoothly soon.\"Li Luo was extremely excited. \"Elder Sister Cai Wei, you're just too capable! Unlike Elder Sister Lingqing, who can't drink but still gorges herself silly!\"Cai Wei's thick eyelashes flapped as she blinked in slight confusion. \"She can't drink?\"Li Luo nodded. \"She drank till she blacked out yesterday! I even had to carry her to her carriage.\"Elder Sister Cai Wei had a playful expression on her face. \"My dumb little Young Lord. Yan Lingqing's alcohol capacity is incomprehensible. She could out drink ten of you and her face wouldn't even turn red.\"Upon hearing this, Li Luo was flabbergasted.\"You didn't have any unsavory thoughts about her, did you?\" Cai Wei said as she sized him up. \"If you did, she will never utter a single good word about you when she's with Qing'e.\"At this point, Li Luo quickly racked his brains as he tried to recollect what happened the previous night. It seemed as though he had not done anything untowards to her... Only upon this realization did he wipe his forehead free of cold sweat.He had almost been toyed with by Yan Lingqing.With a slightly awkward expression, he placed his bowl down. \"I'm heading to the academy.\"Turning away, he swiftly ran off as Cai Wei's melodious laughter echoed out, further increasing his sense of indignation and grief. These elder sisters were just too cunning, and Li Luo had been played like a fiddle.\u201cI'm truly just a child like they say!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, some of the students even had looks of dismay on their faces.Evidently, the majority of them were those that had not done well in the previous day.However, there was no choice. Someone's happiness would come at the cost of someone's sadness. In a qualifying examination like the preliminaries, those who were not strong enough would naturally be eliminated.\"Brother Luo, you're here!\" Zhao Kuo exclaimed when he saw Li Luo, immediately rushing up to him. \"Of your two battles today, one won't be as easy. You're against the First School's Yu Lang. Do you remember him?\"\"Yu Lang?\" Li Luo racked his brain before finally nodding in agreement. That fellow had a bit of fame within the First School, and his strength ranked amongst the top 20. It was said that he possessed a sixth-grade wind resonance that provided him with unparalleled speed.\"That guy is at the Seventh Seal Stage and is significantly stronger than Bei Kun.\" Zhao Kuo's expression became slightly grave at this point.\"Seventh Seal, huh?\" Li Luo puckered his lips. This would definitely be a troublesome opponent. However,Yu Lang should be within the threshold of those that he could beat.Hence, he patted Zhao Kuo on the shoulder and smiled. \"Relax, I have faith in myself.\"Zhao Kuo did not say anything in response as he knew Li Luo's personality. If Li Luo truly knew he had no chance of victory, he would not be putting up a brave front.Whilst the two were speaking, a student from Second School came running over. \"Brother Luo, there is someone outside looking for you.\"Li Luo became a little apprehensive after hearing this but still headed out. Standing in the shade of a tree was an unruly-looking youth with a mane of hair that flapped around him.Li Luo instantly recognized this youth. It was his next opponent, Yu Lang.\"Are you looking for me?\" Li Luo smiled.Yu Lang swept away the hair covering his eyes before giving a deep look at Li Luo. \"Who would have expected that after so long, you would manage to rise again? You truly live up to your previous reputation as the man who once ruled Southwind Academy!\"Li Luo sighed before replying impatiently, \"Don't speak such meaningless words.\"\"How is this meaningless?\" Yu Lang replied in dissatisfaction.In the end, Yu Lang stopped beating around the bush and got straight to the point. \"Song Yunfeng approached me, and he knew I was your upcoming opponent. He even offered a significant price for me to injure you with all my might.\"Li Luo was a little stunned upon hearing this before he laughed. \"Are you telling me your secrets? Or do you plan to take advantage of muddled waters?\"\"Che! I, Yu Lang, may be unrestrained, but I still have a bottom line. You once guided me in resonance arts, and I owe you for that,\" Yu Lang disdainfully replied.\"I am here to remind you that if you are not strong enough to be my opponent, then quickly give up for your own good. Of course, if you've hidden your newfound strength so deeply that even I will be beaten silly... if that's the case, then play along with me! Hmm, I suppose you could 'heavily' injure me and send me flying out of the stage. This way, I can even take a bit out of Song Yunfeng's compensation pool.... Plus, that bastard is a foolish spendthrift. He's offered a huge sum after all\u2026\u201cOh, yes, that bit about compensation is just something extra I tacked on to the agreement with Song Yunfeng. I don't think we will have to go that far though... Li Luo, you might not be aware, but this Yu Lang in front of you is no longer the Yu Lang of the past who tripped over his baggy pants!\" Li Luo may have been slightly cunning, but he was almost shocked blind at the audacity of Yu Lang's grand plan. In the end, he could only helplessly reply, \"You truly are trouble... so I'm reporting you to the teachers.\"This chain of events completely caught Yu Lang by surprise. His jaw dropped while staring at Li Luo. \"What kind of bastard are you, Li Luo?! Do you think it's easy for me to earn a little bit of money? How can you, a young master, know my pitiful troubles in life?! Why would you make life difficult for meeeeeeeeeee!?!?!\" he ferociously scolded!\"Scram, scram, scram!\" Li Luo frowned as he waved his hand to chase away this nuisance. It had been years since they last spoke, but he was still as strange as ever, with even stranger schemes...Yu Lang coldly snorted as he ruffled his hair and turned to leave.Li Luo continued to stare at him, making sure he was leaving before waving goodbye. \"Although this information wasn't that important, thank you nonetheless!\"Yu Lang paused upon hearing his comment, coldly snorting before leaving.\"Young people should always strive to do their best instead of resorting to these means!\"After Yu Lang left, Li Luo frowned slightly. Song Yunfeng's desire to fight had been getting more intense. All of this was due to his infatuation with Lu Qing'er, but also partly to do with the enmity between their families.\"I've been keeping a low-profile, why are you still targeting me!?\"....The first round in the morning went by with no complications and there was nothing much to say. Before he knew it, it was already afternoon and time for Li Luo's match with Yu Lang.On the battle stage, Yu Lang's unruly mane floated with the wind as he coldly stared at Li Luo. \"Li Luo! It's your misfortune to be facing me!\"Meanwhile, the battle stage was surrounded by numerous audience members. Everyone was extremely interested in this particular fight as it was the first time Li Luo would have to face off against a strong opponent.Facing Yu Lang's theatrics directly, and in front of such a large crowd, caused Li Luo to feel a little embarrassed. He definitely did not want to get sucked into Yu Lang's circus show, as it would demonstrate he was no different from this fool\u2026Thus, he quietly activated his resonant power, a pure-blue aura gradually emitting from his entire body, flickering towards the sky. Even the audience nearby could literally feel the air becoming more humid with his presence.Following the administrator's order to begin, Yu Lang, who had been posing, immediately surged with explosive, green resonant power. One could hear the wind whistling and howling by as this resonant power was emitted. Suddenly, he flashed towards Li Luo like a bolt of lightning, so fast that even the onlookers could only catch a trace of his shadow.His burst of speed caused Li Luo's eyes to focus intently. Meanwhile, the audience was cheering endlessly as this was a sight to behold! Yu Lang's speed was clearly ferociously swift!Peng!In the blink of an eye, a fist shrouded in wind and wrapped with a green light struck at Li Luo like a bolt from the blue. Li Luo could only see a fist speedily increasing in size right in front of his eyes, almost completely blocking his vision!Yu Lang was clearly not going to hold back during this fight.Stumbling slightly, he responded with a calm, open palm instead, with blue resonant power gushing out directly, forming a massive, impenetrable wall of water!The wind-infused green fist struck squarely, and the impact caused the water wall to ripple intensely.\"Waowu!\" A weird cry echoed out. Yang Lu's body flickered in response, and numerous afterimages appeared as his speed increased. These afterimages surrounded Li Luo, and each and every one of those fists and legs were wreathed with green light, howling with piercing wind as they attempted to drown Li Luo in a flurry of blows!This was a savage direct assault!Facing these berserk blows, Li Luo quickly adopted a defensive position as the layers of water around him deformed slightly due to the physical strikes, constantly warding off attacks towards his vitals.To the ones watching this battle, they all understood that Li Luo was planning to drag this into a battle of attrition. This was not surprising as water resonances tended to be more enduring and were better suited for it. The more the fight delayed, the clearer Li Luo's advantage would be.\"Li Luo is once again demonstrating his mastery of the Nine Layered Jade Waves,\" some of the more astute students commented.The Nine Layered Jade Waves had once been demonstrated by Li Luo on Bei Kun, and it was perfectly designed for drawn-out battles. One would constantly accumulate greater amounts of power, building up towards a devastating blow that would frighten anyone!However, Yu Lang was significantly stronger than Bei Kun, so it would not be such an easy task to ward off his tempestuous blows.\"Waowu!\" Yu Lang exclaimed strangely once again. His index and middle fingers bent into a hook-like shape and suddenly pierced out with green light condensing on those fingertips. The green light was incomparably radiant, constantly pulsing with energy.\"Wind Finger!\" This finger attack that swept towards Li Luo like a tornado directly perforated the water wall that surrounded him and stabbed towards his chest like a bolt of lightning!Noticing that the opponent's move was blitzing towards him with incomparable might, Li Luo understood that he had nowhere to hide, so he took a deep breath of the moist air around him.\"Gentle Water Fist!\" Li Luo pushed a palm out that was shrouded with blue resonant power. Just as the two attacks were about to collide, his five fingers stretched outwards in a flicking motion, directly creating numerous waves within the sea of water resonant power that surrounded him. This created a huge water vortex in the space before him as a result.On the other hand, Yu Lang's Wind Finger's green light was gradually stripped away by the devastating grinding power of the water vortex, eventually getting completely entangled by this move.By the time the Wind Finger passed through the water vortex, the attack had been stripped of its fangs!Peng!The fist and finger then collided. Their resonant power clashing instantly, sending shockwaves rippling around the stage. Both Li Luo and Yu Lang had been struck directly by the aftershocks, and the two quickly retreated away from each other.Hua!Everyone burst into an uproar at this very sight. Shocked glances were directed towards Li Luo.He had actually managed to weaken Yu Lang's strongest offensive move into a generally harmless strike?Yu Lang was at the Seventh Seal Stage!This was also wind resonance power, which was supposed to have an offensive edge over water resonance power!\"Li Luo's usage of his resonance art was just too mystical. He was able to utilize the Gentle Water Fist to its greatest effect, dispelling Yu Lang's brute-force move. How impressive! The Gentle Water Fist is merely a middle-grade resonance art, yet it can perfectly counter Yu Lang's high-grade Wind Finger,\" said a member of the audience as he sighed in appreciation.\"Li Luo's resonant power is only at the Sixth Seal, which is definitely weaker than Yu Lang's. Yet he is able to persist in the fight for so long...\"\"The title of Southwind Academy's resonance art expert is not for show!\"\"...\" Whilst the people were cheering, Yu Lang's mouth changed into a grin as he focused on Li Luo. This brat truly had hidden his strength deeply! He had not gained any advantage in their previous clashes, which went completely against his own expectations.\"This brat is truly quite abnormal.\"\u00a0Yu Lang had even wanted to take things a little easy, but he had no right to do so!However, this was great! Only a fight like this would hold meaning!Yu Lang's eyes blazed with excitement as he proceeded to launch his next round of attacks. Green resonant power once again billowed out of him and he shot out like a bullet, taking his speed to the extreme.Just as he reached his maximum sprint, he suddenly realized that he had lost his sense of balance, and he mysteriously lost his footing and slipped.Yu Lang's expression was changing constantly from that of excitement, to surprise, to shock when he looked at his feet in the midst of falling. It seemed that at some point, his legs had been entangled by Li Luo's blue resonant power.This resonant power was like a water snake, coiling around both his legs. When he reached his peak speed, it caused him to lose his sense of balance.\"This is...\" Yu Lang's pupils tightened when he realized what had happened.Li Luo, watching him lose his balance, let out a smile. \"Low-grade resonance art, Water Snake.\"You're too careless, Yu Lang. Haha.\" As Li Luo spoke, he took a step forward and chained that move with a double-palmed follow up. Water resonance power cascaded out of him, a sight that reminded the audience of the waves of the sea.\"Although you're no longer tripping due to your baggy pants, things haven't changed. You're still going to fall, and it's because of my water snake!\" Finishing off his banter, he directly slammed his palms into Yu Lang's flying chest.\"F*ck me! Li Luo! You tricked me!\" Yu Lang screamed as he was sent flying away!Bang!Whilst he cursed, he was blasted away, eventually colliding with a wall outside the stage, causing a loud bang.At the moment he landed, a fountain of fresh blood spurted out of Yu Lang's mouth, almost ten meters high! At the same time, copious amounts of fresh blood oozed out of every crevice on his robes, instantly causing him to turn into a bloody figure, a sight that truly horrified the audience.Li Luo, on the other hand, stood there in a slight daze, his lips twitching slightly. This was clearly going too far! Did the human body even have that much blood?! A completely nonsensical sight! He hadn't even hit him that hard... Was this genius trying to swindle Song Yunfeng out of such a large sum that he could retire in peace?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite the din dying down, looks of complete astonishment and horror were still levied upon Li Luo.They were terrified by Li Luo's absolutely merciless blow!Li Luo was speechless at this, silently cursing that bastard Yu Lang. That vagrant had dragged his name through the mud!As he stood on the stage, his gaze sweeped the four directions before finally pausing on a particular seat.Song Yunfeng was sitting right there with a group of friends, gaily chatting. When he noticed Li Luo's stare, he raised his head and returned him an indifferent look before continuing with what he was doing.Li Luo was also uninterested in giving him a piece of his mind, so he turned to leave.\"Brother Luo, you are truly ferocious! Even Yu Lang was ruined by you!\" Zhao Kuo praised as he ran over.\"That brat is just putting on a show.\" Li Luo had a good understanding of his opponent's strength, and if they had continued brawling, he might be the eventual victor, but that would have taken quite a while.Judging by today's results, his current battle strength was on par with that of a Seventh Seal. Entering the top 20 would not be a problem.All that remained were the last two battles tomorrow. If he was able to win both, he would definitely enter the top 20 and could finally take a breather.It was said that once the top 20 had been determined, they could choose to continue battling to determine their ranking amongst the group. Li Luo was not interested in this competition as simply being one of the twenty meant he would be qualified to participate in the College Final Examinations. Thus, there was no need to engage in this meaningless battle.If he had time, he'd much rather practice refining spirit liquids and purifying lights.After the battles for the day ended, Li Luo did not immediately leave the academy, as the pairings for the battles on the following day would be released soon.He wanted to know who he would be up against.Luckily, he did not have to wait long, as an hour later, a metallic ringing resounded throughout the field. Li Luo and Zhao Kuo both made their way to a stone pillar.The stone pillar was surrounded by numerous students, and Li Luo quickly glanced over the flowing characters on the projection screen. Very quickly, he managed to find his opponents for the next day.His first opponent was a Seventh Seal student from the First School. This opponent was known to be significantly weaker than Yu Lang and would not pose a threat to him.Unfortunately, when he discovered who his second opponent was, his gaze gradually narrowed into a squint.\"Brother Luo! What a disaster! Your final opponent is Song Yunfeng!\" Zhao Kuo cried out almost involuntarily when he discovered Li Luo's opponent.Indeed, Li Luo's final opponent was the second strongest student in the First School, Song Yunfeng!Some of the other students had also heard the commotion, and pitiful looks fell upon him.Although Li Luo had recently managed to make a comeback, even managing to beat Yu Lang today, it looked as though his lucky streak had ended.\"Song Yunfeng is apparently at the Eighth Seal! Shit! It doesn't get unluckier than this\" Zhao Kuo sighed as he also felt pity towards Li Luo.Li Luo, on the other hand, didn't seem too concerned. \"None of those that have survived till the end are weaklings. It's not that unusual to encounter him.\"\"No worries! Even if you lose a round tomorrow, your place in the top 20 is basically set in stone,\" Zhao Kuo said, intending to console Li Luo.Although Li Luo smiled and nodded upon hearing those words, his eyes held a trace of gloominess. No one knew exactly what he was thinking.On the other side of the field, Song Yunfeng had also managed to identify his opponents for the next day. Upon seeing that his opponent was going to be Li Luo, he stared at the screen for a good half a minute in a daze before revealing a vicious smile.\"You've had such a glum face the entire time today, yet you're suddenly smiling? Why the change?\" Difa Qing, who had been following him around, asked curiously.\"Well, that is because I finally get to face off against an opponent that brings me joy! I never thought heaven would grant me my greatest wish!\" Song Yunfeng beamed.At this point, Difa Qing noticed Song Yunfeng's opponent for tomorrow. \"Wow, so it's going to be Li Luo? I suppose that's normal since both of you have had a streak of victories. The chances of this happening weren't small... However, his luck isn't great. His winning streak ends now, I suppose,\" Difa Qing replied, slightly shocked. She had a clear understanding of Song Yunfeng's might, and Lu Qing'er was the only student in Southwind Academy with the strength to suppress him. Even though Li Luo had finally started to ascend to the skies, there was still an insurmountable gap between him and Song Yunfeng!She could already imagine the scene of tomorrow's battle. It would be no different from crushing dried and rotten branches underfoot for Song Yunfeng.Furthermore, she also knew that Song Yunfeng absolutely detested Li Luo, whether it was due to personal matters or the struggle between their families. Thus, as soon as the battle commenced, Song Yunfeng would utilize the quickest measures to savagely crush Li Luo, bashing him into the ground.For a brief moment, Difa Qing even felt a trace of pity for Li Luo. The result was already predetermined.However, Li Luo truly had it coming! If he knew that Song Yunfeng liked Lu Qing'er, why had he not distanced himself from her? After all, an envious man that had been provoked would not act rationally.Li Luo, on the other hand, left the academy as soon as he saw who his opponents were for the next day. Zhao Kuo could only say goodbye with a look of sympathy on his face.Whilst on the carriage back, Li Luo's eyes were closed as he remained deep in thought.The battle with Song Yunfeng the next day would be unimaginably difficult. The opponent was at the Eighth Seal and possessed significantly denser resonant power. Furthermore, he also had a seventh-grade Crimson Eagle resonance.Seventh to ninth-grade resonances were considered high-grade, and thus Song Yunfeng's resonance fell in that category.One should not underestimate what a high-grade resonance was capable of. The power produced by a seventh-grade resonance was not the same realm as middle-grade or low-grade resonances. The resonant power was denser and also possessed some form of spirituality.Spirituality was a difficult concept to explain; it was something that was ephemeral and could only be experienced when it was used on one's opponents.Thus, the seventh-grade could be considered to be a watershed. Those who could cross this gap would be in possession of an almighty resonance.Additionally, within the threshold of a high-grade resonance, they were also further classified into upper and lower distinctions. This was not applicable for first to sixth-grade resonances, and it allowed one to better differentiate the potential within these high-grade resonances.Song Yunfeng's Crimson Eagle Resonance was a lower seventh-grade.Thus, regardless of resonant power or resonance grade, Li Luo was one step behind Song Yunfeng, and this battle was clearly not in his favor.No one had high hopes for the battle between the two. Even Li Luo himself was no exception.\"This is truly very troublesome,\" Li Luo mumbled to himself. Although his waterlight resonance was unique in its own way, it was still only a fifth-grade resonance. Even though the spirit liquids and purifying lights refined by it were not inferior to what a seventh-grade resonance could refine, this was not applicable in the context of a battle. His resonance was unlikely to have any advantages in a head-on collision.If he could somehow temper the waterlight resonance to the sixth-grade by tomorrow, he would definitely feel less pressure. Despite constantly chewing through his supply of spirit liquids and purifying lights, he had still been unable to increase the grade. More time was needed, and this was not enough to put out the inferno burning at his gate.\"Should I just concede instantly?\"\u00a0Li Luo scratched his head. This was honestly a possible choice. No matter how he considered the situation, this was the most normal and expected potion. Everyone knew of the huge gap between the two and that it was basically uncrossable. If he knew the result but still persisted, would that not make him a masochist?Li Luo continued to ponder. He had no plans to visit Suncreek Villa today, so he went straight home. Even if there was no alternative choice, he would still prepare himself for the worst.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked absolutely terrible, with black eye-circles and sluggish movements. It was as though he had not slept well the previous night.\"What's wrong? Didn't sleep well?\" Cai Wei asked with concern.Li Luo shook his head and smiled. \"The academy has been having their preliminary examinations recently, and I think the stress has gotten to me.\"He didn't want to mention the situation of him having to face off against Song Yunfeng today. There wasn't any point.Cai Wei nodded knowingly, and her radiant and beautiful egg-shaped face had an encouraging expression. \"Do your best! I'm sure you can do it!\"\"Oh, Yan Lingqing asked about you yesterday. It seems that you didn't go to the Suncreek Villa?\"While hurriedly stuffing several mouths of porridge into his mouth, Li Luo garbled, \"Please let her know that once my preliminary examinations are done, I will spend more effort on resonance smithing. If she wants to find me for a chat, I will be more than pleased to do so then!\"Cai Wei smiled mischievously. \"Why did you not tell her personally?\"\"I was afraid she might beat me to death,\" Li Luo answered honestly before devouring his breakfast. After waving goodbye, he quickly ran off.Seeing this scene, Cai Wei could only shrug helplessly as she watched Li Luo escape, wryly shaking her head. After which, she continued to have her breakfast as though nothing had happened, slowly chewing and enjoying it....\"Li Luo.\" As Li Luo made his way to Southwind Academy, he heard a familiar, clear, and crisp voice behind him. Turning around, he saw the good-looking and immaculate Lu Qing'er sitting right beneath a massive viridescent tree.Lu Qing'er was currently wearing a black, short-skirted academy uniform. This coupled with her snow-white skin made the sight of her even more attractive. Her thin waist and short skirt further accentuated her slender legs. She was so eye-catching that everyone who was in the vicinity would furtively glance at her every so often.Li Luo, hearing her greeting, immediately walked over and gave a casual smile.\"I heard you're going to be facing off against Song Yunfeng today?\" Lu Qing'er asked as her brows knitted together in a frown.Li Luo could only nod in response.\"What do you plan to do?\" Lu Qing'er asked.Li Luo paused for a moment before frankly responding. \"I'll probably just give up on the fight.\"Hearing this response, Lu Qing'er gave a light laugh, but there was no intention to mock him. Instead, she only seriously nodded. \"That is a very logical decision. There is no need for you to prove yourself against him. With your talent in the resonance arts, the gap between you two will lessen in time.\"\"I feel the same way too.\"At this point, Lu Qing'er became slightly silent and solemn. \"I'd like to apologize for what has happened. I think that part of the reason why the situation has devolved to such an extent is because of me.\"Li Luo smiled, \"Well, honestly, you're barely the problem. It mostly has to do with the relationship between House Luolan and the Song family. Of course, I think the bigger reason is that Song Yunfeng is afraid.\"\"Afraid?\" Lu Qing'er's almond-shaped eyes blinked curiously.Li Luo gave an insipid smile. \"Well, he's afraid that I will return to that form I had in the past. If that were to happen, he would forever live in my shadow and all of his effort throughout the years would go to waste. People would ridicule him.\" If anyone else heard these words, they would think that Li Luo had a screw loose in his head. Furthermore, the Song Yunfeng of today had much more influence and standing in the academy than Li Luo.Lu Qing'er, on the other hand, looked pensive. She was extremely clear about how outstanding and exceptional Li Luo was in his prime. Even now she found it hard to match up to him, much less Song Yunfeng.\"So, he wants to firmly suppress and completely crush you before you are able to mature? This also serves to fortify his own confidence?\" Lu Qing'er asked.\"Most likely.\" Li Luo nodded.\"If this is the case, then he won't let you give up so easily,\" Lu Qing'er commented.\"I hope he won't do that. If that's the case...\" Li Luo mumbled. Following which, he waved goodbye to Lu Qing'er and walked in the direction of the Second School, where he heard some indistinct shouts.\"...then I will have no other choice.\"Lu Qing'er stared at his leaving silhouette, slightly shocked as Li Luo didn't seem to be pushed to his wits' end. Perhaps he had some other means to avoid the fight with Song Yunfeng?\u2026...Li Luo's first fight ended without any surprises. The second battle was organized as the final fight of the preliminary examinations.It seemed as though it was set up to be a fitting finale to the examination.The field was a hubbub of voices and shouts whilst innumerable students crowded around it.On the upper platform sat Dean Wei Sha and the rest of the teachers, ready to watch the battle.\"Keke. Who would have expected Li Luo to clash with Song Yunfeng? Do you think there will even be a fight?\" Dean Wei gave a lengthy laugh.Lin Feng put on an indifferent smile. \"What sort of meaning is there in such a pointless battle?\"Xu Shanyue sighed darkly. \"There might not even be a battle. This is completely imbalanced, and an instant forfeit would be best. There's no need to fight and humiliate himself.\"Although Li Luo was from the Second School and Xu Shanyue was extremely biased towards him, the odds were clearly stacked against Li Luo.The gap was large, and it seemed impossible.The old dean nodded as he sighed. \"Li Luo has already entered the ranks of the top 20. This already demonstrates his exceptional speed in catching up. If he was given more time, reaching Song Yunfeng's level would not be difficult. However, with how little time there has been, he is still lacking.\"As they continued to banter, the atmosphere came to a head as the appointed time of battle approached silently.Song Yunfeng got up from his seat and confidently floated atop the battle stage. His upright posture and handsome face seemed to create an image of a heroic warrior.When Song Yunfeng took the field, enthusiastic cheers resounded throughout. One could see his exceptional reputation and fame within the academy by looking at the crowd's display of excitement.On the other half of the field, Li Luo also gradually made his way atop the stage under the watchful eyes of the crowd.\"Wow, he's so handsome! He's even better looking than that Yunfeng guy!\" Although Li Luo did not make any fancy moves when entering the stage, numerous girls immediately screamed their heads off when he stood atop the battle stage. He had inherited his parents' excellent genes and he truly was top-notch when it came to appearances. Relatively speaking, Song Yunfeng looked like a peasant standing next to royalty.Comparatively speaking, the two individuals atop the battle stage had tuned out all of these extraneous elements and focused their minds on their upcoming fight.Li Luo stared at Song Yunfeng directly as he raised his hand.Before he could speak, Song Yunfeng dully asked, \"Are you planning to give up?\"Li Luo smiled. \"Are you planning to humiliate me with words? So that my hot headedness will lead me into a direct clash with you?\"Song Yunfeng's eyelid twitched upon hearing this blunt accusation. He indifferently replied, \"I will not humiliate you. I just think that your parents must be proud of a son like you, bringing them fame with your courageous moves.\"With that provocation, the entire field turned silent. Who would have thought that Song Yunfeng's words would be so blunt and insidious?Li Luo was also a little stunned upon hearing those words. Following which, he gave Song Yunfeng a thumbs up. \"Truly amazing. This is truly a single fatal blow! Well, since it's come to this...\"At this point, Li Luo started to stretch his neck muscles and cracked his knuckles. Immediately after, he rushed at Song Yunfeng with a toothy smile. The only thing was that his pearly-white grin seemed to be filled with a trace of ruthlessness.\"Come on, then, Song family's son of a b*tch! I'll give you one chance to fight. Lets see if you're good enough to take a bite out of me!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He would clash with Song Yunfeng head on!However, this collision would be akin to smashing an egg against a rock... there was no hope.\"Brother Luo...\" On the side of the Second School, numerous fellow classmates were fraught with worry. Zhao Kuo especially was constantly pounding his fist in anxiety. \"Song Yunfeng, you bastard! That's such a low blow!\"Everyone else nodded in agreement. Song Yunfeng had clearly resorted to underhanded means to provoke Li Luo, truly shameless.Within the crowd was a certain Yu Lang. He was still lying on a bed, tightly wrapped all over in bandages. In order to demonstrate his professionalism in acting out his role, he remained tightly bedridden, but even then, he would not miss this show, opting to have his bed dragged near the stage...\"What is Li Luo trying to do? Does he want to be abused?\"Not far away, Lu Qing'er was also observing the machinations on the stage. Her face was wreathed in a dark frown. She had expected Song Yunfeng to throw out some taunts in order to incite Li Luo; however, even then she did not think that he would target Li Luo's two missing Duke Stage parents. Clearly, Li Luo held a deep sense of gratitude and respect for his parents. Even though he could shrug off insults towards him, he would never let anyone else tarnish his parents' names and honor.Frankly speaking, Song Yunfeng did not possess any right or stature to even attempt to smear the Dukes. However, when faced with this situation, Li Luo was unwilling to take it sitting down.Lu Qing'er gaze swept across the battle stage, eventually resting upon Li Luo. At this point, the thought struck her. Had Li Luo really been forced into a confrontation with Song Yunfeng because of those words?On the stage, Song Yunfeng's icy glare was focused on Li Luo. The phrase \"Song Family's son of a bitch\" uttered in front of the entire audience had also caused him to feel incensed.Despite that, he did not continue to spar with verbal barbs. That was pointless. He would wait for the battle to begin, then he would completely thrash Li Luo. The best retort would be to literally step on Li Luo's face in front of all.Once the administrators had confirmed that neither of the two parties were planning to forfeit, they solemnly announced the commencement of the final fight.Bang!The moment the start of the fight was declared, Song Yunfeng immediately summoned all of his crimson-red resonant power, sheer energy blasting into the skies. Within the resonant power, one could vaguely see the form of a Crimson Eagle materializing.This was Song Yunfeng's seventh-grade resonance, which specialized in blazing heat and berserk power.Song Yunfeng did not hold back at all, his Eighth Seal cultivation demonstrated for all to see. A suppressive atmosphere also exuded from him, directly oppressing one's spirit.On the other side, Li Luo similarly channelled all of his resonant power. Blue resonant power that looked like the waves of the sea wrapped around his entire body.Directly comparing the strength and density of resonant power, it was obvious to the audience that Song Yunfeng held a significant advantage.This directly caused the mood to turn slightly gloomy. Just how could Li Luo overturn such a stark disadvantage? Impossible!At this moment, Li Luo placed both his palms in front of him in a stance. The blue resonant power around his body gradually started to ripple, and everyone could see that he was activating his oft used Nine Layered Jade Waves.The Nine Layered Jade Waves' weakness was that it required a period of time for it to reach its peak. Unfortunately, Song Yunfeng wouldn't just sit around and twiddle his thumbs while this happened.\"Hmph!\" Song Yunfeng, who noticed this, immediately snorted. He circulated the crimson-red resonant power around him whilst he explosively shot towards Li Luo.A bolt of crimson light lanced across the stage with speed akin to a cannonball entrapped within a fiery tornado. A leg lashed downwards like a fiery hammer, directly chopping down towards Li Luo.Song Yunfeng was not planning to play around, and immediately exerted his full strength. His only desire was to launch a blitz of attacks, quickly trampling Li Luo beneath him.Facing Song Yunfeng's ferocious and merciless assault, Li Luo immediately started brandishing his palms in a circular motion, his water resonance power directly forming a water curtain to defend against the attack.Weng!Unsurprisingly, when faced with Song Yunfeng's berserk resonant power, the water curtain immediately gave way like a piece of paper. A simple touch of his moves directly shattered Li Luo's paltry defense, and the Nine Layered Jade Waves followed suit right after. Song Yunfeng's absolutely tyrannical force had completely crushed Li Luo's attempt with a simple move.A dull thud resounded when Song Yunfeng's foot made contact, shockwaves rippling immediately after. Li Luo, on the other hand, was directly knocked flying tens of meters away, almost out of the stage and disqualified.Hua!The entire crowd gasped at this scene. This was only the first exchange, and the stark difference in strength was evident. Song Yunfeng completely suppressed Li Luo. Even though he had excellent talent in the resonance arts, it was useless against absolute might.Lu Qing'er's pretty face looked grave at this moment. Even with her breadth of experience, she saw no way for Li Luo to make a comeback.\"Don't give up, Brother Song! Beat him up!\" On the other side of the stadium, Bei Kun and Difa Qing were currently standing with a group of Song Yunfeng's friends. Bei Kun was cheering agitatedly at this point.Difa Qing was silent though, only shaking her head in response. The gap between the two was just too vast! There was no chance to turn things around.On the stage, Li Luo's fists were stained with some crimson-red energy. He immediately willed icy-blue resonant power to surge out and extinguish the crimson-red residue. Vapor hissed into the sky when the two energies clashed, and Li Luo slowly savored the burning pain. He finally had an understanding of how strong Song Yunfeng was.\"This level of strength...\"A glint flickered through Li Luo's eyes.\u201cHu!\u201dYet at this point, Song Yunfeng was not planning to give Li Luo any chance for rest. He immediately launched a vicious assault, akin to a hawk attacking its prey. The air whistled as his swift moves swept towards Li Luo.Li Luo raised his head and saw a crimson light rapidly approaching him. He was right at the edge of the battlefield, and if he was not careful, it would be the end of the game there and then.However, his expression did not hold any trace of worry, nor did he seem demoralized. He took a deep breath and immediately activated his water resonance power. Executing certain hand seals, a resonance art took shape.A faintly blue water curtain took form in front of him, looking vaguely like a thin mirror.Some of the audience immediately recognized the move. \"High-grade resonance art, Water Mirror Art?\"Lu Qing'er's eyes briefly lit up. The Water Mirror Art was a defensive resonance art that did not possess much defensive power. Instead, it was able to reflect a portion of the opponent's attack to mitigate the damage.However, the Water Mirror Art alone would be unable to even slightly hinder Song Yunfeng's savage and cruel flurry of blows.In that brief moment, Song Yunfeng had already pounced right in front of Li Luo. Staring at the thin water curtain, a trace of ridicule and coldness could be seen in his gaze. Li Luo might have a wide repertoire of resonance arts, but if he thought that a mere Water Mirror Art was going to stop him, then he was truly too naive.After which, Song Yunfeng mustered even more power and punched outwards. The fist that rushed towards Li Luo was like a screaming, red eagle eager to devour its prey.At the moment the blow was about to strike the water curtain, Song Yunfeng could vaguely make out a blurry humanoid shadow within the mirror. This reflection was also simultaneously lashing out against him with a crimson-colored fist. The two fists collided, and he could feel his fist punching through the water curtain as well.Bang!At this point, a low rumble could be heard.When the resonant power energies collided, they created a tempest that swept away all of the debris around them, scattering it in every direction.Li Luo's body was shaken and he was forced back two steps. Just another step would cause him to fall off the stage. However, no one was focused on that. Instead, their attention was all placed upon Song Yunfeng, who seemed to have received a massive backlash from his attack. He had actually been knocked back countless tens of steps, barely stabilizing himself!Immediately looking up, Song Yunfeng's face was full of shock.He had actually been pushed back?How did Li Luo's Water Mirror Art possess such terrifying recoil strength?The rebounded energy had reached a level equal to 70% of Song Yunfeng's previous move!This was in a realm of power completely impossible for an ordinary Water Mirror Art to attain!\u201cHua!\u201dThe audience erupted in endless uproar and astonishment at this scene. Song Yunfeng, on the other hand, had an expression of uncertainty as he viciously scowled at Li Luo.Li Luo's Water Mirror Art was truly damn strange!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How can his Water Mirror Art block Song Yunfeng's full-strength move?!\" The entire audience was shocked silly by this development. Everyone had looks of puzzlement on their faces.They were not unfamiliar with the Water Mirror Art, and some of the water resonance users in the crowd also utilized this move. However, blocking Song Yunfeng's attack like Li Luo had just done was just a pipe dream for them.This clearly incomprehensible situation had unfolded right in front of their eyes.Difa Qing's beautiful eyes had widened into full moons and her jaw dropped.\"Did I just see something supernatural?\" Bei Kun was equally dumbfounded.Lu Qing'er, who was not far away, also had a look of surprise. Her slender eyebrows were raised, her eyes focused on Li Luo. It was as she had guessed: Li Luo did have some means to deal with Song Yunfeng!Even an impossible situation could be turned around by him!Amidst the cacophony of shouts, Li Luo shook his stinging arms before making his way into the inner part of the stage. He stared at Song Yunfeng, whose expression was flickering between jubilation and frustration, smirking and rushing towards him.Deep down, he could feel a great sense of accomplishment and joy spreading through him.His experiment had truly succeeded!The resonance art he had just used looked like the Water Mirror Art, but there were some additional intricacies to it. This was because Li Luo had infused it with light resonance power, layering the Shadow Reversal Art atop it.The Water Mirror Art would reflect a portion of the attack back to mitigate its effect, while the Shadow Reversal Art was designed to reflect the opponent's attack as a counterattack. These two reflective resonance arts had layered to become an exceptionally strong Water Mirror Art that could reflect even the strongest attacks!Li Luo had experimented and discovered that when the two arts were perfectly synchronized, they might even be able to cause severe harm to the opponent!Using their own abilities to counter themselves!This modified version of the Water Mirror Art had been renamed to the Waterlight Demon Mirror.\"Stop screwing around and pretending to be mysterious! Do you really think that you can change the inevitable outcome?\" Just as Li Luo was celebrating to himself, Song Yunfeng's expression turned gloomy and he shot out explosively towards Li Luo. His fingers were arched like talons, and as he slashed down, sharp, crimson-red talons materialized from his resonant power, tearing through the skies.There was no hesitation as he continued his stream of attacks.Li Luo immediately reacted with his strengthened Water Mirror Art, and a thin curtain once again appeared in front of him.Peng!Song Yunfeng's savage blow collided directly. A muffled sound could be heard when their moves clashed. Both of them were simultaneously forced back.Song Yunfeng had prepared himself for the recoil and hence did not end up embarrassed like the previous exchange. However, his expression instantly became uglier as he realized that Li Luo's Water Mirror Art was too insidious. Every clash felt as though he was punching himself instead of the opponent!What in tarnation was this? Could it even be considered a Water Mirror Art?Song Yunfeng's blitz had been stonewalled by Li Luo, and the entire audience gulped in trepidation. This happening once could be considered luck, more than that demonstrated skill.It wasn't only them who were confused. Even the ones sitting on the raised platform, such as the old dean, Xu Shanyue, Lin Feng, and so on, were equally startled by the scene before them.\"Li Luo's Water Mirror Art is clearly normal,\" the old dean commented in surprise.The rest of the teachers nodded in agreement. The run-of-the-mill Water Mirror Art would never be able to leave Song Yunfeng in such a miserable state.\"It's reflective strength has similarities to the Duke resonance art Mysterious Water Mirror,\" a teacher commented.However, this was quickly met with a rebuttal. \"Do you really think Li Luo is able to utilize a Duke Stage resonance art with his Sixth Seal Stage resonant power?\"The one who previously raised this point was silent and unable to reply. Duke Stage resonance arts required immense amounts of resonant power, so much that even a Tenth Seal Stage cultivator might not be able to utilize them.\"That is definitely a Water Mirror Art,\" Xu Shanyue concluded after close observation. \"However, it looks as though Li Luo has also modified it.\"The other teachers stared at each other blankly. Modifying a resonance art? Although they all knew that Li Luo was extremely gifted in understanding and executing resonance arts, this idea seemed preposterous. Could a person of his caliber and cultivation level even have the ability to do so?Unfortunately, this seemed to be the only possible explanation.\"He truly is the son of those two...\" In the end, the rest could only sigh at the thought of this.On the other hand, Teacher Lin Feng had been completely silent from the beginning, his face completely black. This entire scene had played out completely different from his expectations.Back to the battle stage, the audience were cheering repeatedly in waves at the intensifying battle.Song Yunfeng looked so gloomy, it was frightening. He stared daggers at Li Luo as he continued to ponder his next action. Every time he wished to take action, he would be reminded of that special Water Mirror Art and could only stop himself.\"Do you dare to attack me?\" Song Yunfeng said through gritted teeth.He realized that Li Luo could only use the Water Mirror Art to counter his moves. So long as he did not take the initiative to strike, Li Luo's Water Mirror Art would be useless!Li Luo grinned upon hearing those words. Slightly shaking his head, he retorted, \"I wouldn't dare. Why don't you try?\"Song Yunfeng was so furious upon hearing this that he was trembling in anger! He finally experienced firsthand what it meant to be frustrated and indignant! He was clearly multiple times stronger than Li Luo, but this damned tortoise shell of a move just kept hindering him! His hands were truly tied!Song Yunfeng was not a complete imbecile. He gradually calmed himself down and began to consider his options. All of a sudden, he dashed towards Li Luo.The difference this time was that he had suppressed his resonant power significantly.\"This Water Mirror Art is a high-grade resonant art, so it's resonant power consumption must be considerable. If I can force Li Luo to consistently activate it, then he will be drained of his resonant power! When he is no longer able to sustain the move, he will no longer have any means to fight back anymore, and there will be nothing to fear,\"\u00a0Song Yunfeng mused to himself.When Li Luo saw Song Yunfeng's change in tactics, he could also sense the reduced resonant power output by Song Yunfeng. Thinking things through, he was quickly able to grasp his intentions.\"Looks like he does have a brain after all. However, if he suppresses his resonant power, why would I be afraid of him?\"\u00a0Li Luo smiled. Song Yunfeng's tyrannical advantage came from his superior resonant power. Now that he was resorting to his hands and feet instead, what was there to fear?Hence, he took the initiative to move towards Song Yunfeng. The two bodies directly clashed, hands and feet pummelling each other, bereft of resonant power. Even then, their physical prowess could produce sonic booms upon attacking.The two were fighting in close combat, a complete frenzy from the position of the onlookers. However, as things went by, Song Yunfeng's expression changed for the worse. He had discovered that without the assistance of his resonant power, he had no way to overpower Li Luo!Song Yunfeng's gaze was filled with fury, and he suddenly burst out with his full potential, punching out with a berserk blow infused with crimson resonant power, hoping to deal an unexpected, vicious blow.When his fist was about to collide with Li Luo, the dreaded water curtain once again appeared. Clearly, Li Luo had prepared himself to execute the resonance art at a moment's notice.Peng!When his furious fist collided with the water curtain, massive amounts of resonant power rebounded back towards Song Yunfeng, forcing him to retreat in complete depression.Li Luo had similarly been forced back, but the strain on him was less evident. Rubbing his knuckles, he gave a smile that was not a smile to Song Yunfeng, seemingly provoking him.\"Li Luo!!!!! I would like to see just how many times you can keep this up with your paltry Sixth Seal resonant power!\" Song Yunfeng screamed with an ashen face full of exasperation. \u00a0Crimson-red resonant power surged out of him like a tide as he attacked with everything he had.He was at the Eighth Seal Stage, so his resonant power was significantly denser and greater than Li Luo's. Even though Li Luo possessed a water resonance, he would still use the most direct method to grind down his reserves!Song Yunfeng did not bother to take a break. He immediately activated all of his resonant power to launch yet another battery of blows.In response, Li Luo continued to use his Water Mirror Art as per before.Peng!A familiar scene took place when the two were knocked back.For the next few moments, the audience continued to watch dumbstruck as the two continued the exact same set of motions\u2026Song Yunfeng charged forward like an enraged bull, while Li Luo activated his Water Mirror Art much like a matador with his cape. Then a bang would be heard and the two would separate.No one felt that this was exceptionally strange. They all knew that Li Luo had less resonant power to begin with and that it would be a matter of how long he could keep up. These repetitive clashes continued until Li Luo's thirteen Water Mirror Art was broken.The water resonance power shrouding Li Luo seemed to have thinned out and lost its original sheen.This was the sign of resonant power exhaustion.Some within the crowd immediately voiced their regrets. It looked like things were coming to a close.Song Yunfeng on the other hand finally leaked out a cold smile. \"What are you going to do now Li Luo? You're all out of juice!\"Bang!Never one to let up an opportunity, he sprinted forward, summoning up all of his crimson-red resonant power. At this point, even his eyes had been infused red, making him look like a demonic eagle pouncing on its prey.Seeing Song Yunfeng's relentless offensive, Li Luo did not do anything. Instead, he silently stood at his current position, watching the furious, red shadow gradually growing larger in his view.At the moment when that blazing fist was about to strike, when Song Yunfeng was just an inch away from Li Luo, the attack was suddenly forced to a halt.A hand had tightly clutched onto Song Yunfeng's arm, preventing him from going any further.Frustrated, he turned to look and noticed the administrator standing right beside him, directly preventing him from making any further moves.\"What the hell are you doing?!\" Song Yunfeng howled.The administrator was expressionless, directly pointing at a stone pillar. Atop it was an hourglass, and no one else had noticed that the sand had stopped flowing.Li Luo exaggeratedly loosened his sore shoulders, giving the most radiant and gentle smile he could at Song Yunfeng.\"Oh! It looks like time's up, you idiot... Perhaps you wanted some overtime?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The battle was over before they had realized it...They suddenly understood that although Song Yunfeng was planning to deplete Li Luo's strength, Li Luo was similarly also playing for time! They had completely overlooked this fact.Now that the hourglass had completely emptied, the battle would be over as a draw, based on the rules.This was to say that Li Luo and Song Yunfeng had actually fought to a standstill.This was completely unexpected!No matter how one looked at it, this sort of result should not have occurred. Song Yunfeng was superior to Li Luo and had a huge advantage in both resonance and resonant power. Thus, this was supposed to be a walk in the park for Song Yunfeng, akin to him crushing dried roots underfoot.Regardless of how much Li Luo could struggle, there was no way to compete against a seventh-grade resonance coupled with Eighth Seal Stage resonant power. He had no advantage whatsoever.Unfortunately, the result begged to differ.A scene of complete domination had been juxtaposed into a draw...Their gazes naturally drifted towards the individual who had overdrafted his resonant power, the sickly-pale Li Luo. Gradually, admiration emerged within their eyes.The only exception was Bei Kun. He looked as though he was constipated, and his complexion was truly a sight to behold.Difa Qing, who was standing at the side, sullenly stared towards the stage. Her gaze seemed lifeless and her heart was in turmoil. Only after a period of time did she take a deep breath, deeply gazing at Li Luo.Although Li Luo looked pale and weak, it was as though she could see a radiant brightness emanating from him.It reminded her of a particular legend who had been immortalized in Southwind Academy's monument of honor.However, she quickly snapped out of that strange dream. Li Luo might have created a miracle, but he could barely hold a candle to Jiang Qing'e.On the battle stage, Song Yunfeng was sluggishly taking in the scene in front of him. All of a sudden, he lashed out at the administrator. \"I was clearly about to beat him! He had no more resonant power left! I would have won! Just give me another second. Just one second!!!\"The administrator frowned at the irate and completely ballistic Song Yunfeng. This fellow used to be a gentleman who spoke kindly to everyone around him, but now that he didn't get what he wanted, his true colors were shown.\"The rules are THE RULES. If there has been no victor declared once the hourglass is out of time, the result is a draw,\" the administrator stated flatly.\"Bullshit!\" Song Yunfeng growled ferociously.How could he accept a draw as a result? His face would be dragged through the mud if word got out!The administrator did not bother with him. He proceeded to announce, \"This battle is now over. It is a DRAW!\"\"Brother Luo is AWESOME!\" The moment the administrator announced the result, the Second School erupted into violent cheers and celebration loud enough to topple a mountain... Everyone in the Second School was exceptionally excited as Li Luo's excellent performance had brought much face and respect to their Second School.The completely bandaged Yu Lang even managed to barely open his mouth to croak out some comments. \"Is this weirdo truly rising to the top again? Even Song Yunfeng suffered...\" \u00a0Amidst the ear-piercing howls of jubilation, Lu Qing'er quietly stared at Li Luo's silhouette. It felt as though she had been transported into the past, staring at that still immature but exceptionally talented genius who had taken the first step into learning resonance arts before any of them. Even then, he would casually give out pointers to help everyone out.The Li Luo from back then was extraordinarily outstanding.Lu Qing'er even saw him as something of an idol back then, setting him as her target.However, once his blank palace manifested, all of his wonder completely shattered.\"I just knew that he would definitely get back on his feet. Back then he was truly dazzling. However, he is still too weak. I want to see you climb to the top. Then I will defeat you fair and square!\" Lu Qing'er's hair gently swayed with the wind whilst her bright pupils burned with anticipation of their future battle. She gave Li Luo another glance before turning to leave.Who would have expected the demure and sweet beauty Lu Qing'er to possess such a strong intent to compete and battle!On the battle stage, Li Luo stared at the extremely gloomy Song Yunfeng and sighed. \"Sheesh. I gave you a chance, but you didn't want to take it. You truly ARE useless, my friend.\"Hearing that jibe, Song Yunfeng became even more incensed. He scowled at Li Luo.\"Now that you've missed this opportunity, I don't think you will ever have another chance to do so!\" Li Luo completely disregarded Song Yunfeng's venomous glare as he walked forward and even lightly patted him on the shoulder. With a smile on his face, he continued his tirade. \"I haven't forgotten your attempt to smear my parents' names. We will settle this properly in the future.\"Gritting his teeth, Song Yunfeng gave a cold chuckle. \"Well, then, I'll be waiting.\"Li Luo nodded and, without uttering any more extraneous words, proceeded to leave the battle stage. The students of the Second School were already waiting for him, hoisting him above their heads and cheering as they departed as a group.With that group leaving, the atmosphere of the field died down. The remaining audience members curiously looked at Song Yunfeng before gradually dispersing.Li Luo was simply supposed to forfeit today. Instead, he had been provoked by Song Yunfeng into a fight, and instead of an overwhelming victory for Song Yunfeng, he had been taken for a ride by Li Luo, turning him into the butt of a joke.One could imagine how this news would spread throughout Southwind Academy and what sort of legends it would give rise to. Song Yunfeng had officially become a stepping stone of someone else's story!On the raised platform, the old dean and the teachers were silently in deep thought. This result had also exceeded their expectations.After a period of time, the old dean finally sighed. \"Li Luo never sought to win. His intention was always to play for time and obtain a draw. No one expected him to actually succeed.\"Xu Shanyue, on the other hand, had smiled until his cheeks were sore, letting his expression do the talking instead. Li Luo had won him a lot of face and respect. Despite Song Yunfeng being one of the most elite students of the First School, almost on par with Lu Qing'er, he had actually been taken for a fool and dragged into a draw.Would anyone dare to say that the Second School possessed insufficient talent now?No one truly felt that this was a draw. This was because the difference in strength between Li Luo and Song Yunfengwas just too vast. One was at the Sixth Seal Stage and had a fifth-grade resonance. Song Yunfeng? Eighth Seal Stage cultivation and a seventh-grade Crimson Eagle resonance. This was incomprehensible. Even if a teacher was placed in this scenario, they would have no idea how they could possibly turn the tables. Li Luo, on the other hand, had done so! This was truly something deserving of praise.Not everyone was like Jiang Qing'e, with a ninth-grade resonance. When there was a will, there was a way!Lin Feng's expression was also as dark as night. Faced with Xu Shanyue's laughter, he couldn't hold it in any longer. \"Li Luo's performance today was impeccable. However, the preliminary examinations have a time limit. What about the College Final Examinations? He will require true ability then and will be aunble to rely on such underhanded means. There's no meaning in this.\" \u00a0Xu Shanyue coldly snorted. \"Li Luo might make further improvements by then.\"\"Even if he improves again, he'd at most be at the Seventh Seal Stage,\" Lin Feng cooly retorted.The old dean waved his hand, indicating for the two to stop bickering. He stared in the direction where Li Luo had gone before giving the duo a good look. His face immediately became stern. \"Li Luo's performance is his problem. I want to remind you that during the College Final Examinations, our Southwind Academy needs to maintain our position as the number one academy of the Tianshu Province. If any mistake arises\u2014hmph!\" Upon hearing the old dean snorting coldly, the teachers all shivered within their hearts.Lin Feng paid particular attention to those words as he knew that they were meant for him. The First School had the best students and also monopolized the lion's share of resources. The College Final Examinations was a litmus test for whether they truly deserved all this.Lin Feng also knew that the previous First School teacher had ruined Southwind Academy's prestigious name of the number one academy during the last College Final Examinations. He had been directly booted out of the academy by an incensed old dean.Thus, if the academy did not perform well, he would not be spared either.The thought of that caused Lin Feng to feel shivers down his spine. He hurriedly assured, \"Please relax, Dean. Our First School's might is evident for all to see. We will maintain the academy's honor and reputation.\"\"Good.\" Only then did the old dean's expression soften a little. Without speaking further, he turned and left.His departure allowed everyone else to heave a sigh of relief. An angry dean was truly frightening...\"Eastpool Academy seems to be extraordinarily aggressive this year. I hear that they have the full backing of the Governor's Mansion and that they've been rising through the ranks recently, almost catching up to Southwind Academy. The top student is the son of the governor, and I believe he goes by the name of Shi Huang? It's said that he possesses heavenly talent and is no weaker than Lu Qing'er. Thus, this year's College Final Examinations will not be so simple.\" Some of the teachers discussed worriedly.Lin Feng gave that teacher a glare and indifferently replied, \"Eastpool Academy's foundation cannot compare with ours. If they want to wrest our title away, they have to get the agreement of the First School.\" Following which, he walked off.The rest looked at each other in dismay. Some weren't happy with Lin Feng's arrogance, but they were helpless in this situation. Grumbling to themselves, they walked away as well.\"Well then, we'll leave you to handle it. If something goes wrong, then let's see who gets the last laugh.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0036\u2013 First Grade Tempering Treasure MarketPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith the final battle leading to a draw, Li Luo's position was now firmly entrenched within the top 20 for the preliminary examination.Based on what had happened in the past, the top 20 would have another round of selections to determine their internal ranking. However, Li Luo was completely uninterested in this meaningless demonstration. Whether one was the twentieth or the first, they would all still get an equal chance to participate in the College Final Examinations.Participating actually had a chance of being detrimental, because if one were to reveal their trump card, other academies would prepare for it and it would only make their life more difficult.Therefore, wasn't it better to keep a low profile? It wasn't as if getting first place warranted a reward from the old dean or anything!In fact, if it was not for Song Yunfeng stubbornly provoking him repeatedly, he would have chosen to forfeit instantly!He never felt any shame in giving up if he was unable to win. It was a loss as far as he was concerned, as he had been forced to reveal his upgraded Water Mirror Art. This was too unworthy a platform to demonstrate his ingenuity!Hence, when Xu Shanyue had asked if he was willing to compete for the top 20 ranks, he simply responded with one word. If he had time, he would want to temper his resonance and hopefully upgrade it to the sixth-grade before the final examinations started.Xu Shanyue was not surprised and wished him well. Preparations for the final examination were key after all.The rankings were out the next day, and the Second School had two representatives: Zhao Kuo and Li Luo. The two could be considered peas in a pod, with Li Luo getting the fifteenth position and Zhao Kuo the sixteenth, separated by just a hair.Li Luo's fame had greatly risen as a result of that final battle. The students all reckoned that if he was willing to compete, the top ten positions were not out of reach. However, he had given up the opportunity to compete and was given the rank accordingly.These twenty would represent Southwind Academy in two weeks' time at the College Final Examinations. They would struggle for the right to enter the Astral Sage College.As the most elite school of the Xia Kingdom, the Astral Sage College provided a certain number of places for entry each year. The only catch was that each and every place would be hotly contested for.Each and every year, Southwind Academy usually managed to obtain the greatest number of spots, which was how they had cemented their reputation as the top academy in the Tianshu Province.It was not as though they did not have competition. Eastpool Academy, for example, was a close competitor. Although they did not have as great a foundation, their rate of ascension through the ranks had been ferociously quick. Coupled with the support of the Tianshu Province's Governor's Mansion, they had managed to prove themselves a worthy contender for the position of top dog, especially with their stellar performance in recent years.It was rumored that Eastpool Academy was hoping to unseat Southwind Academy this year, and a fierce battle between giants was expected.After the preliminary examination, Southwind Academy would normally have a week of holidays. Students could choose to head back home or continue to cultivate within the school. Li Luo chose the former.Within the old manor, inside Li Luo's room.Li Luo's eyes were closed tight, his body lightly emanating light. In front of him was a pile of already-utilized fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lightsAfter a long period of absorption, he gradually opened both his eyes. A trace of blue light flickered through his pupils.\"This is the last bottle...\" He stared wistfully at the now-empty crystal bottles and shook his head in sadness. Cai Wei had already managed to purchase 83 bottles of fith-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights for over 400,000 pieces of skygold. This was a massive investment. If not for the sale of certain House Luolan businesses, their finances would have been unable to support his lavish expenditure.The worst part was that even after utilizing so many tempering treasures and his fifth-grade resonance improving by quite a bit, the distance to the sixth-grade was still quite large.As a result, he had to figure out some way to allow his waterlight resonance to reach the sixth-grade before the final examinations.The most recent battle with Song Yunfeng might have been a draw, but Li Luo did not feel proud or content with that. He knew that if not for that time limit, he would have suffered a complete loss, left defeated and on the ground.A draw could not possibly occur within the final examinations.If one wanted to earn the right to enter the Astral Sage College, they were also required to possess sufficient strength.The most elite students across the academies of the Tianshu Province would participate. The battles would undoubtedly be intense and fierce, far from what occurred within Southwind Academy.Additionally, Li Luo had already selected a new energy cultivation art, which required a minimum of a sixth-grade resonance to practice.Thus, the sixth-grade waterlight resonance was something he urgently required.\"Based on the rate of my progression, if I want to temper my resonance to the sixth-grade, I still require one more batch of fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights.\"However, it seems like Elder Sister Cai Wei often takes the long way around whenever she spots me. It's almost as though she doesn't want to see me...\"\u00a0Li Luo was left with a conundrum. Cai Wei had even avoided breakfast in recent days, perhaps spooked by the idea that Li Luo would want some more spirit liquids and purifying lights.Fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights weren't random cabbages found on the street. Each one cost at least 5,000 pieces of skygold, and 50 would be 250,000 pieces of skygold. This was already close to a year of income for House Luolan's businesses in the Tianshu Province.Thus, Li Luo completely understood why Cai Wei would avoid him. Even though she was an excellent general manager, the moment she took over the Tianshu Province's businesses, she had only constantly sold off House Luolan's properties instead of turning things around. This was basically ruining her reputation and career\u2026Even so, she had not given up on the situation nor resigned, leading Li Luo to look at her with immense respect and appreciation for her broad-mindedness.Unfortunately, Li Luo had no alternative. This acquired resonance was a money-sucking black hole. It was a great thing that his parents had left behind House Luolan for him! Otherwise, he would just drop dead in five years\u2026\"Let's first head to the Suncreek Villa.\"\u00a0Li Luo was a little depressed. House Luolan was surrounded by both internal and external problems, so he could not keep taking without giving back. Even if all of it could be mobilized at his beck and call, he would not actually take it to the extreme and completely sell off everything. If he actually did so, he would inevitably fall into disrepute.Most importantly, everyone would think of him as an ignorant, arrogant young master! This was a label that Li Luo did not want\u2026Thinking things through, he came up with a few ideas and made his way towards the Suncreek Villa.At the Suncreek Villa, he directly went to Yan Lingqing's refining workshop. However, once he pushed the door open, he saw two familiar silhouettes sitting together, discussing something. A trace of concern could be seen on their expressions.Naturally, they were Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing.When they saw Li Luo, they exclaimed in surprise, \"Young Lord?!\"\"What are you guys talking about?\" Li Luo smiled as he walked in. Numerous crystal bottles containing spirit liquids and purifying lights were on the table in front of the two beauties. One of the bottles contained the first-grade spirit liquid he had personally refined before.\"We are discussing this year's sales performance of the Suncreek Villa,\" Cai Wei answered directly without any reservations.\"It's not great?\" Li Luo frowned slightly when he heard this. The Suncreek Villa was responsible for half of the Tianshu Province's income, and if performance faltered, this would affect him greatly.Yan Lingqing pointed at the crystal bottles with her slender, jade-like finger, her voice clear and cold. \"There are two families competing with us in the first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights market. One is House Luolan with our Azure Jade Spirit Liquid, while the other is the Song family's Pine Nut Villa. They produce this product known as the Wondrous Sunshine Light. Both are quite similar in tempering strength, and in previous years, we captured perhaps 80% of the market as a whole. However, in recent times, the Pine Nut Villa has improved the tempering strength of their Wondrous Sunshine Light. The average tempering strength is now close to 57%, which is almost on par with the best spirit liquids that the Suncreek Villa is able to produce. As a result, they have managed to control over half of the first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights market, and our corresponding portion has decreased accordingly. If this continues, the Suncreek Villa will eventually lose the battle against the Song family, bringing about great harm to the Suncreek Villa and, more importantly, House Luolan as a whole!\"Li Luo listened intently, and his expression became solemn. \"How is the Suncreek Villa's production rate when it comes to first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights?\"\"The Tianshu Province's Suncreek Villa is able to produce five first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights a day, 150 in a month. This goes into the market for roughly 50 pieces of skygold per item. In a year, the total comes up to about 90,000 pieces of skygold. Deducting the costs would give us a profit of about 30,000 pieces of skygold,\" Cai Wei said honestly. It was clear that she possessed an in-depth understanding of House Luolan's finances within the Tianshu Province.Li Luo gave Cai Wei a thumbs up in praise before becoming slightly surprised at these estimates. The first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights alone brought in 10% of the Tianshu Province's profits! One could tell how important the sales of spirit liquids and purifying lights were.This was not completely unexpected because high-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights were not wilfully squandered by people. Most of those who purchased first-grade and second-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights were not individuals with first or second-grade resonances. Instead, it was people who wanted to support the expenditure of squandering higher grade spirit liquids and purifying lights, thus utilizing these lower grade treasures as replacements.The trade-off was that these lower grade tempering treasures would inevitably cause a quicker build-up of impurities. There was no other option as not everyone was a rich young master like Li Luo.After hearing about this, Li Luo's first thought was that he could not let the Suncreek Villa's businesses be affected. This would inevitably hurt him directly when it came to obtaining more spirit liquids in the future\u2026\"How could the Pine Nut Villa's Wondrous Sunshine Light improve in tempering strength?\" Li Luo asked.\"What determines a spirit liquid and purifying light's tempering strength is dependent on three aspects. The formula, the experience and strength of the individual, as well as the quality of the materials.\"Yan Lingqing continued indifferently, \"After investigating the Wondrous Sunshine Light, it looks as though they have made minor changes to the formula. It looks as though the Song family has spent a large sum to hire an expert to make adjustments to it.\"Cai Wei's left hand was wrapped around her lower chest, propping up her right arm, which her chin was resting on. Frowning, she said, \"Furthermore, that troublesome Zhuang Yi has been using this as a pretext to attack Lingqing, clamoring for her to be kicked out of the Suncreek Villa as if this entire issue of lessened sales is due to her.\"The two of them were standing side by side, and Cai Wei with her unknowing actions had accidentally caused the natural differences between the two to be accentuated even further. Yan Lingqing's lack thereof could only be described as unfortunate\u2026As though Yan Lingqing had subconsciously realized something, she emotionlessly pushed Cai Wei's right arm down.Cai Wei did not react initially, but her egg-shaped face was quickly flushed red in embarrassment. At the same time, she gave Yan Lingqing a strong pinch.After this brief exchange, the two focused their attention back onto Li Luo but realized that he was completely in a daze. Recovering gracefully, he put on a serious expression. \"When we are discussing serious issues, don't fidget around. You two are mature adults after all! If this happens again, I will have to criticize your actions,\" he admonished. This immediately elicited cold snorts from the duo before they continued their discussion.\"Is Zhuang Yi still creating trouble?\" Li Luo asked to get things back on track.Upon hearing his name, Yan Lingqing's face blazed with fury. \"That bastard has been finding trouble for me all day long. He has been creating layers upon layers of internal conflict within the Suncreek Villa. The reason for our reduced production rate has to do with him.\"\"He truly is a disaster. Can we not figure out some way to get rid of him?\" Li Luo grinned evilly, completely dissatisfied. Here he was, trying his best to raise a large amount of funds, but this troublemaker was creating more trouble instead of assisting him?Cai Wei frowned. \"The current Suncreek Villa is a group lacking a leader. Lingqing is too new and does not wield much influence. Zhuang Yi, on the other hand, is an old and established individual. Many of the resonance artificers within the Suncreek Villa trust him, and without a proper reason to dispose of him, it would inevitably create even more internal troubles. Furthermore, that damned Pei Hao is also supporting him.\"Li Luo scowled upon hearing this. Pei Hao, that white-eyed wolf, was the greatest danger to House Luolan. Zhuang Yi could only truly affect the Suncreek Villa. Pei Hao, on the other hand, sought to gobble up the entirety of House Luolan.This was someone trying to steal his lifeline. The moment House Luolan was gobbled up, how could he find resources to satiate his bottomless acquired resonance? With his looks?Pei Hao had already established himself, while Li Luo was just a growing sprout, completely incapable of contending against him. In the meantime, all he could do was hide behind Sister Qing'e and slowly develop\u2026As he continued trying to think of a method, someone came to report a new development.\"Young Lord, General Manager, and Vice President Yan... Vice President Zhuang has summoned Suncreek Villa's entire management. He says there is a huge issue at hand. Would the three of you kindly attend?\" Upon hearing this announcement, the three of them were stunned by this event, looking at each other whilst frowning in dismay.Just what was that troublemaker up to this time?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was because the entire senior management of the Suncreek Villa had arrived.Right in front of them was Zhuang Yi with a beaming smile on his face. Sitting right by his side was a dour-faced old man\"Hmm?\" Upon seeing that old man, Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing both let out soft cries of surprise before explaining the situation to the slightly confused Li Luo. \"That old man is known as Zheng Ping. He is an elder of the Suncreek Villa's headquarters. His influence in the organization is huge, and he belongs to the founding generation of the Suncreek Villa. He has been around since it was first established by the House Lords. However, this old man is known to be extremely pedantic and strict, a bag of smelly and stubborn bones. He usually resides in the Xia City headquarters. Now that he has suddenly arrived without giving us any notice, I can only imagine that things have gotten pretty bad.\" After the explanation, everyone in the discussion hall stood up and greeted Li Luo respectfully.Even Elder Zheng Ping from the Suncreek Villa's headquarters stood up and respectfully uttered, \"We greet the Young Lord.\"\"Elder Zheng is too courteous.\" Li Luo flashed him a smile as the trio got to their seats.\"May I kindly know when Elder Zheng arrived in the City of Southwind?\" Yan Lingqing suddenly asked.Elder Zheng Ping expressionlessly replied, \"The Tianshu Province's Suncreek Villa has been performing poorly this year. Headquarters has thus sent me here to take a look. At the same time, they've dispatched me to settle the issue regarding the presidency of this branch.\" At the same time, he glared strictly at Yan Lingqing. \"Vice President Yan, I've already seen the reports. The first-grade refining workshop under you has performed abysmally. As a result, the reputation of the Suncreek Villa in the Tianshu Province has been tarnished. What do you have to say about this?\"Yan Lingqing coldly replied, \"If you want to know why, you can ask Vice President Zhuang. I'm sure he can provide a more accurate answer.\"Zhuang Yi immediately retorted, \"Vice President Yan is simply incapable. Don't push the blame onto others.\"\"If it was not for you secretly blocking the supply of materials to my first-grade workshop, to a point where I was unable to operate on certain days, would I have had such a terrible result?\" Yan Lingqing snorted.Zhuang Yi immediately protested, \"House Luolan's situation in the Tianshu Province is simply not great. Some of the materials come from the three families as well, and they have always sought to suppress us. What lands in my hands is naturally not much. Furthermore, the third-grade refining workshop in my management is the best performing workshop in the Suncreek Villa! Should I simply give it to you too? To let you reap the benefits of my efforts?\"\"You!\" Yan Lingqing was so incensed she slammed the table beside her.\"Silence!\" Elder Zheng Ping bellowed. He severely glared at both Zhuang Yi and Yan Lingqing. \"All of you have your reasons, but this old man does not care. I'm only concerned about the Suncreek Villa's results. Whoever causes the Suncreek Villa to decline, or tarnishes its reputation, will not be forgiven. The Tianshu Province's performance has been getting worse, and the key reason is that there is no president. Thus, headquarters has discussed the issue and given the order. The branch in the Tianshu Province will immediately elect a new president!\" His proclamation immediately silenced the entire discussion hall. The members of senior management did not make so much as a squeak, as they understood that this would be a battle between Yan Lingqing and Zhuang Yi. The worst part was that they were just the vanguards. There was an entire larger battle raging around their skirmish, thus they would only quietly watch from the sidelines.A glimmer flickered through Li Luo's pupils. What Zheng Ping had said was not wrong. The Suncreek Villa in the Tianshu Province had too much internal conflict, and if stability was wanted, a new president would be necessary. Most importantly, just who would the elder choose?As he pondered over the circumstances, Li Luo smiled and asked directly, \"Elder Zheng Ping, who do you feel is most suitable to be president?\"Zheng Ping may have treated Yan Lingqing rudely, but when facing Li Luo, he maintained a sense of decorum. After deep thought, he announced, \"If we follow the Suncreek Villa's eternal rule, it should be the one who is best at managing the refining workshops.\"Zhuang Yi, who was at the side, let out a sneaky smile. He personally managed the third-grade workshop, which also surpassed the other two in absolute sales. Hence, this rule was most beneficial to him.At this point, Elder Zheng Ping continued, \"This is, of course, according to the rules. If the Young Lord has any suggestions, please let them be known. This old man can relay your suggestion to headquarters as well. However, we will still have to decide who will be the president now; otherwise, this old man will be stuck here until that has been done. I hope the Young Lord will not fault me for this, as I only have the Suncreek Villa's and House Luolan's interests at heart.\"Although Zhuang Yi's expression remained unchanged, his heart was in turmoil! Why did that damn old man have to speak so much??Li Luo gave the elder an eye and had an idea. It seemed as though Elder Zheng Ping's appearance was not as Yan Lingqing had suspected, that someone else had dispatched him to cause trouble for their faction. At the very least, he was not on Pei Hao's side.The biggest fear for them was if the individual suddenly appointed by headquarters to visit the Tianshu Province was involved in the proxy war between Jiang Qing'e and Pei Hao. Luckily, Elder Zheng Ping was a neutral party and was known to be a stickler for rules. It seemed as though this was the result of the battle fought in the shadows.From a certain point of view, this was not bad news.The only issue was that if traditional rules were utilized to judge the most suitable candidate for president, then Yan Lingqing would be at too much of a disadvantage. Furthermore, the third-grade refining workshop that Zhuang Yi controlled was the Suncreek Villa's most profitable one as well. What it raked in was significantly greater than both the first and second-grade refining workshops combined.Yan Lingqing also understood this point, and her pretty face turned frigid. Her pretty eyes were also laced with fury, almost as if she was about to erupt.Li Luo, sensing the anger, immediately grabbed the back of her hand before looking at Elder Zheng Ping with conviction. \"So whoever's refining workshop does the best will then become the president?\"\"Yes.\" Elder Zheng Ping nodded.Li Luo sighed deeply before continuing, \"This idea isn't bad. Let's go ahead with this.\"His words were immediately met with hushed discussion.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing were astonished by this. They were unable to understand his intentions. This seemed to mean that he was giving up the fight for president.Zhuang Yi was also shocked at this development for a moment before quickly recovering. \"The Young Lord truly is broad-minded! Isn't it right that we just want the Suncreek Villa to be the best that it can be? Ultimately, doesn't the Suncreek Villa exist to enrich the Young Lord?\" he said with a huge smile. Elder Zheng Ping was a little surprised as well. \"Young Lord, do you truly wish to do this?\"Li Luo nodded and did not say anything else. He immediately got Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing to follow him out of the discussion hall.Once out, Li Luo separated himself from the two. At this point, Yan Lingqing immediately berated him. \"Li Luo, just what are you trying to do? This rule does not favor me, so why did you agree? If you don't want me to be here, just say the word! I will immediately head back to Xia City!\"Cai Wei was also staring at Li Luo intensely. From what she knew of him, he was not an impulsive individual, but his actions today seemed to show otherwise.Yan Lingqing had come to the Tianshu Province's Suncreek Villa to provide help and reinforcements. Only with her here were they able to prevent their current state of affairs from getting worse. However, everything seemed to have been thrown into disarray with that one line.Li Luo smiled in response. \"My two dear elder sisters, I am definitely not a fool. Can't you see that I'm worthy of your trust?\"Cai Wei shot him an unconvinced look before the two of them turned around and left in a huff, not interested in entertaining him any longer.\"Although the rules don't benefit Elder Sister Lingqing, don't you think that this is the best sort of situation, one where she can legitimately compete for the role of president? At the same time, we have an opportunity to get rid of this cancer known as Zhuang Yi.\" Li Luo smiled.The two paused in their tracks and turned back to look at Li Luo. This was a good opportunity... However, Zhuang Yi clearly was in a position of strength! If they were to play with fire, they might very well get burnt.At this point, a glint flickered through Cai Wei's eyes as she stared at Li Luo in shock.\"Could it be... that you have a way to turn the tables?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0038\u2013 Secret Art WatersourcePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment Cai Wei blurted out those words, Yan Lingqing couldn't help but to turn and glare at her. \"What sort of solution can this buffoon have? He's barely spent any time on resonance artificering!\" she spat out furiously. She did not continue her tirade because Li Luo had not even spent a month on this. It would be a fantastical story if he was able to reverse the dreadful situation they were in.Li Luo smiled and did not speak. Instead, he beckoned for the two of them to enter Yan Lingqing's refining workshop, closing the door after them. Only then did he continue speaking. \"I understand that the Suncreek Villa is responsible for half of House Luolan's Tianshu Province profits, roughly 150,000 pieces of skygold. Within the Suncreek Villa, the first-grade refining workshop contributes 30,000 pieces of skygold, the second-grade workshop 40,000 pieces, and the third-grade 80,000 pieces.\"\"If you understood the situation, then why did you go and shoot your mouth off? There's clearly a huge gap! How can we possibly catch up?\" Yan Lingqing angrily thundered.As she was managing two of the refining workshops, she was extremely clear of the facts. The third-grade workshop significantly exceeded the first-grade and second-grade workshops in value and also had the best performance each year. This was like the difference between heaven and earth, something extremely hard to bridge.\"More importantly, the Suncreek Villa's Azure Jade Spirit Liquid has been suppressed by the Pine Nut Villa's Wondrous Sunshine Light. This has directly reduced our sales of spirit liquids, and in this situation, forget turning things around, our performance will only get worse!\"Li Luo smiled again. \"And so this is our top priority to fix! We need to first stabilize the Suncreek Villa's first-grade sales and improve its reputation in the market.\"Yan Lingqing snorted. \"As I previously explained, there are three aspects that affect the spirit liquids and purifying lights' tempering strength. Materials, the resonance artificer, and the watersource or lightsource. The Azure Jade Spirit Liquid has a perfected recipe, and with our current abilities, we cannot make further inroads in terms of improving it, unless we can hire an expert resonance artificer. However, this requires a lot of time and capital, neither of which we have!\u201d\"A slow remedy cannot address our current situation. I'm sure the Song family has prepared for quite a while for this, waiting for the perfect time to strike. As House Luolan is now struggling internally, they took advantage of the opportunity to deal this vicious blow!\" Cai Wei mused.\"Our only response is to improve our resonance artificers' skills and experience. However, with such a small period of time, it's impossible to suddenly expect everyone to explode in potential and for the standard to rise just like that. This isn't a fantasy story! Its unrealistic!\" Yan Lingqing quipped.Cai Wei continued to stare intensely at Li Luo, smiling. \"Didn't the Young Lord produce an Azure Jade Spirit Liquid with 60% tempering strength?\"Yan Lingqing rolled her eyes at Cai Wei. \"How many spirit liquids do you think a single person can produce? Even if we turn him into a cash cow, he can barely squeeze out any milk!\"Li Luo's handsome face turned a shade of black. Although he didn't mind refining first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights, he was still a respectable individual! Why did they have to demean him like that? And a cow of all things!\"Well then, the only solution is to improve the watersource or lightsource,\" Li Luo continued, not willing to bicker with the two.Yan Lingqing unhappily replied, \"This is dependent on the resonance artificers' resonance grades and affinities. Could it be that you're willing to improve the resonances of all the resonance artificers in the Suncreek Villa? If we had a secret art watersource or lightsource, it could allow us to improve the tempering strength of our spirit liquids and purifying lights. However, this is a closely guarded secret for even major powers! Our Suncreek Villa simply does not possess this.\"Li Luo lightly chuckled upon hearing this. \"That might not be the case.\"The duo stared at him with a trace of bewilderment.Under their careful scrutiny, Li Luo removed a crystal bottle from his robe. The bottle was half-filled with a deep-blue liquid.\"Do you want to give this a try?\" he asked.Yan Lingqing's eyebrows rose in suspicion. \"As I told you before, you simply can't just use someone else's watersource. Only a secret art watersource...\"Before she could finish her sentence, Li Luo uncorked the bottle and a steady stream of pure energy wafted outwards. This was what caused Yan Lingqing to pause in her tracks, staring in astonishment at the crystal bottle.As though possessed, she immediately snatched the crystal bottle out of Li Luo's hand and gently poured a droplet onto her finger. Carefully inspecting it, the shock on her face only grew more intense.\"There is no attribute or characteristic mixed into this. Could this be a secret art watersource? \u00a0This sort of purity is even higher than what someone with a seventh-grade water resonance can produce. How could you have obtained such a high grade secret art watersource?\" Yan Lingqing asked as she grasped Li Luo's hand crazily. It seemed as though she had lost all sense of rationality at this sight.Secret art watersources were differentiated by grade. The one Li Luo had taken out had already reached the purity of a seventh-grade one. Such a pure watersource could definitely increase the success rate and tempering strength of spirit liquids when utilized, something truly rare.Li Luo could feel a piercing pain due to how tightly Yan Lingqing was squeezing his hand. Seeing how agitated she was, he slowed down his words in an attempt to calm her down. \"Elder Sister Lingqing, don't be too flustered. Can we use this watersource for refining spirit liquids and purifying lights?\"\"Of course we can! A secret art watersource of this purity would definitely allow the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid to reach 60% tempering strength, at the least when used in the refinement process. This would be more than enough to beat the Wondrous Sunshine Light at its own game! The only problem is that the amount is too little. If we were to use it for refinement, it would only be enough for around 30 spirit liquids.\" Her beautiful pupils were firmly affixed on Li Luo, completely different from her usual, indifferent, and icy gaze. It seemed almost incompatible with the personality Li Luo knew her for.\"What if we were to use it on second-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights?\" Li Luo asked after a moment of thought.\"It might be true that using such a treasure on first-grade spirit liquids would be almost wasteful. However, it's as I said\u2014the amount of watersource is simply too little. If we were to use it on second-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights, I'm afraid we would only be able to refine a few of them. It might be more efficient to use it to refine first-grade spirit liquids...\" Yan Lingqing replied.Li Luo felt a little awkward deep down. This \"secret art watersource\" was the watersource condensed by his waterlight resonance. Due to his blank palace, even the watersource he condensed possessed a trace of its void affinity. In essence, it was just like a secret art watersource, able to be used by anyone for resonance artificering.However, this half a bottle was something he had managed to produce only after three days. He was currently only at the Sixth Seal Stage, so his resonant power was not extremely dense nor plentiful. Thus, the amount of \"secret art watersource\" he could produce was also limited.\"I guess we can first use it on the first-grade Azure Jade Spirit Liquid for now then. If I'm able to pass a bottle like this to you every three days, would it allow the first-grade refining workshop to become the best performing workshop within the Suncreek Villa?\" Li Luo asked.Cai Wei paused to consider. \"The first-grade refining workshop sells about 150 bottles of Azure Jade Spirit Liquid a month. This roughly adds up to about 90,000 pieces of skygold a year. The third-grade refining workshop brings in 210,000 pieces of skygold. For the first-grade refining workshop to surpass the third-grade, we would need the sales to increase manifold. There will be some significant difficulty involved if we wish to purely rely on the first-grade refining workshop.\u201d\"Well, if we have sufficient amounts of this secret art watersource, it would not be difficult to increase our sales by that much! With how pure this secret art watersource is, utilizing it on first-grade spirit liquids for refinement is akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Thus, the tempering strength would definitely increase significantly.\" Yan Lingqing said confidently.Clapping his hands, Li Luo laughed. \"Then it looks like our problem has been solved.\"Yan Lingqing was a little dazed at his response, spacing out for a moment. Had this arduous problem been resolved in such a simple manner?How could it be so simple?Yan Lingqing exhaled deeply. It truly wasn't as easy as Li Luo had mentioned. It was only because Li Luo had managed to produce an item that surpassed everyone's expectations. If anyone else knew that he was utilizing such a treasure to create first-grade spirit liquids, they would inevitably curse him angrily for being the fool and wastrel that he was!The two ladies glanced at each other, tacitly agreeing to not ask Li Luo how this secret art watersource had come about. The way they saw it, it likely had to do with a secret passed down by the two House Lords.\"It looks like the Young Lord might be House Luolan's harbinger of wealth!\" Cai Wei laughed whilst coyly covering her mouth. Her beautiful face was absolutely bursting with joy.\"Although the secret art watersource might be a little small in amount, it will definitely be more than sufficient to meet the Suncreek Villa's needs in the interim.\" Yan Lingqing's small and square head lightly nodded. The Suncreek Villa currently only sold 150 bottles a month, and at the rate which Li Luo would provide it, this would definitely meet all their existing needs.\"Alright, I won't speak of this anymore. I have to go and make use of the time we have to produce the first batch of enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquids. We first need to build a reputation for our new product and improve public opinion...\" Yan Lingqing tightly grasped the bottle of deep blue liquid as though it was her baby and immediately rushed off.Li Luo and Cai Wei could only helplessly look on before they left the refining workshop together. Yet before Li Luo could say anything, Cai Wei immediately started to stride away quickly, and he had to quickly reach out and stop her.\"Elder Sister Cai Wei, are you trying to get rid of me?\" Li Luo asked angrily.Cai Wei innocently looked at him. \"Young Lord, what are you trying to say? I have many tasks to settle!\"\"Elder Sister Cai Wei! I've just resolved the Suncreek Villa's predicament! You can't just ignore my outstanding service and contributions...\" Following which, Li Luo furtively glanced around in every direction before lowering his voice. \"I still need a batch of fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights.\"A trace of bitterness could be seen in Cai Wei's eyes as she looked at Li Luo. \"Young Lord, it has barely been a month, yet you've gobbled up almost 800,000 pieces of skygold. This is two years of the Tianshu Province's profits. At the rate you're going, we just can't afford to feed you any longer!\"Li Luo seemed a little ashamed at this point. The speed at which he burned through skygold was indeed a little excessive. However, he had no choice! This acquired resonance was a skygold-devouring beast! He could only praise his parents for leaving behind an entire house as the foundation for him. Otherwise, reaching the Duke Stage within five years would be an impossible dream...\"This will be the last batch of fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. I promise,\" Li Luo swore.Upon hearing those words, Cai Wei paused for a moment before lightly gritting her teeth. \"Fine... then I will have to sell two more businesses.\"Simply saying that caused Cai Wei to feel a little bit of sadness in her heart. With her abilities in management, she had never thought that she would have to sell the businesses under her to maintain the state of affairs. She had no choice in this matter... Li Luo was, after all, a bottomless pit. Still she was extremely dissatisfied.Li Luo gave a dry cough and smiled as he nodded. He truly wasn't lying. His waterlight resonance was about to reach the sixth-grade, so fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights would no longer be required.At that point, he would only require sixth-grade ones\u2026Of course, this was something he hid in his heart and refused to speak of. At least for now...Otherwise, Cai Wei might simply just quit in frustration on the spot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was already able to produce a single first-grade Azure Jade Spirit Liquid reliably each day. He could be considered a full-fledged resonance artificer now.Additionally, the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid he refined had tempering strength that was constantly increasing as he gained more experience.However, he was not satisfied with just this. Thus, he started to experiment with second-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. These were several times more complex to refine than first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights, with more complicated materials and processes. As a result, he was faced with innumerable failures.Li Luo was not disheartened or anxious despite this. Failure was the mother of success and also an invaluable experience. So long as he continued to accumulate experience, it was just a matter of before he would succeed in becoming a second-grade resonance artificer.Luckily, the last batch of fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights were finally sent over by Cai Wei. As he continued to guzzle these tempering treasures down, he could faintly feel that his waterlight resonance was gradually approaching the sixth-grade.In the interim, he had also managed to raise his resonant power to the Seventh Seal and was jubilant. He was not surprised by this, as he had spent painstaking effort cultivating in the cultivation room of the old manor. Coupled with the purity of the resonant power produced by his waterlight resonance, his cultivation was simpler and quicker. Thus, he was effectively no weaker than an individual with a seventh-grade resonance.At the same time, he had also received good news from Yan Lingqing. The first batch of enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid had been refined.The Suncreek Villa.An intricately carved box was placed atop the table. Inside it were 40 crystal bottles, filled to the brim with azure-green liquid.This was the enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid.Yan Lingqing's face was full of undisguised excitement. She said to Li Luo and Cai Wei, \"The secret art watersource provided by Li Luo is unfathomably pure! As a result, the first-grade refining workshop's success rate has increased significantly. Originally, we could only produce five spirit liquids a day, but now we can produce ten! Furthermore, the tempering strength of these spirit liquids is around 60%. These are definitely considered high-quality first-grade spirit liquids!\"As Li Luo listened, he frowned. Based on his quick math, if they produced ten bottles a day, a year's income would only be around 180,000 pieces of skygold. There was still a gap between that and the 3rd-grade refining workshop.He immediately voiced his concerns as a result.\"That's something I can solve. Leave it to me!\" Cai Wei flashed an enchanting smile at the group.\"How does Elder Sister Cai Wei plan to do this?\" Li Luo asked with a little bit of surprise.Cai Wei continued to smirk. \"The Golden Dragon Bank has been stocking up on first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. They are also paying higher than market price, at almost 60 pieces of skygold a bottle. If they choose to purchase the Suncreek Villa's Azure Jade Spirit Liquid, we can set up an agreement that will definitely allow us to exceed the profits of the third-grade refining workshop.\"Additionally, and more importantly, the Golden Dragon Bank possesses a stellar reputation, and their choice will definitely demonstrate just who produces the highest quality first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights in the Tianshu Province. Their endorsement is actually the most valuable thing here.\"Li Luo took all of it in and understood the situation. The Golden Dragon Bank had always been a purveyor of fine goods and would normally never even deign to look at low-grade treasures. If they had a need for them, they would naturally gravitate towards the very best. If one were chosen by them, they could even work out an agreement for future business whilst improving the reputation of the maker's products. This would be excellent publicity in and of itself.\"I will drop by the Golden Dragon Bank later. I hope the Young Lord will also accompany me. I want to take advantage of your looks... and reputation,\" Cai Wei stated with a grin.The Golden Dragon Bank had always remained neutral. However, it also possessed titanic strength, and in the Xia Kingdom, no one would wantonly provoke them. On the other hand, they also prized harmony and wealth creation, thus they never sought to create enemies either.Li Luo was House Luolan's Young Lord. Even though his influence in the family had wavered, his title was still his own, deserving of respect.He had no objections, and frankly, he only wanted to ensure that the Suncreek Villa was under his tight control. That way, it could continue to churn out skygold for him... He definitely wouldn't mind being brought along as a mascot.\"Let's go.\" He picked up the box and left with a smiling Cai Wei.....The dazzling and luxurious-looking Golden Dragon Bank was constantly bustling with people as one of the most popular areas in the City of Southwind.When Li Luo and Cai Wei entered the bank, a female attendant immediately rushed out to attend to them. After finding out that they were looking for President Lu, she explained that he was currently welcoming another group of guests and that they would have to wait for a while.Without anything else to do, the two found a place to sit and awaited President Lu.Yet just as Li Luo sat down and started staring at the fascinating tiles on the ground, he noticed a slender leg appear in his sights. Glancing upwards, he realized that Lu Qing'er's pretty face was directly in front of him.She was wearing a black, short skirt, contrasting against her white thighs, creating an enthralling sight. Combined with her fine, black hair draped behind her, she was like a fairy in the flesh.\"What is the Young Lord doing here?\" she asked curiously.\"I'm looking to discuss business with President Lu.\" Li Luo smiled.Lu Qing'er stared at the box beside him, directly getting to the meat of the question. \"Is it first-grade spirit liquids?\"She was naturally well-versed with all the issues regarding the Golden Dragon Bank, especially their recent demand for first-grade spirit liquids.Li Luo nodded.\"Does such a simple matter require the involvement of the Young Lord?\" Lu Qing'er continued to question. Ultimately, high-quality first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights were still just that! First-grade treasures! Whether it was House Luolan or the Golden Dragon Bank, the cost to purchase them would merely be a drop in the ocean.Li Luo sighed and said in a low voice, \"You will never understand the struggles that a young lord in dire straits faces...\"Lu Qing'er couldn't help but laugh, then her gaze shifted to the mature and charming beauty beside him. \"This elder sister is extremely gorgeous. Does the role of a general manager in House Luolan have such strict requirements too?\"Cai Wei lightly laughed. \"Younger Sister, you are also very beautiful. I'm sure your suitors in Southwind Academy are as plentiful as the clouds. I wonder if the Young Lord is also one of them?\"\"Don't drag me into this pointless thing...\" Li Luo dryly coughed.\"Let me bring you to find Second Uncle. He's currently dealing with the people from the Song family. They've taken the initiative to approach us, directly hawking their Wondrous Sunshine Light after they found out that our Golden Dragon Bank was searching for first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights.\"Li Luo and Cai Wei glanced at each other. It had slipped their minds that the Song family would have similar thoughts. They weren't idiots after all, and they wanted to borrow this opportunity to rise above their stature and improve the reputation of the products they refined.\"Won't we be interrupting their discussion?\" Li Luo may have sounded a little embarrassed, but he had already stood up, ready to go.\"Well, there's no decision being made,\" Lu Qing'er commented indifferently before turning around to lead the way. \"Though you should already be aware of the quality of the Pine Nut Villa's Wondrous Sunshine Light. I might be able to lead the way, but if you want Second Uncle to change his mind, you need to prove your ability with the quality of your goods.\"\"I, Li Luo, have always been an outstanding and upright individual. I would NEVER rely on my connections,\" Li Luo declared heroically...Lu Qing'er sighed lightly and did not want to bicker any further. She directly led the two through the corridor. They eventually reached a VIP room, and someone familiar was seen walking out of it.\"Song Yunfeng?\" Li Luo exclaimed in surprise.Song Yunfeng also saw Li Luo and was slightly astonished. At the same time, he frowned and addressed Lu Qing'er directly. \"Qing'er, why did you bring him here?\"\"Li Luo and my Second Uncle have a meeting, and so I decided to lead them here,\" Lu Qing'er said with an unchanging expression.Li Luo looked at her radiant and beautiful face. A beauty was truly able to lie without batting an eyelid! Her performance was absolutely perfect!Song Yunfeng's expression turned dark as he couldn't tell if she was lying. However, he had no choice\u2014this was the Golden Dragon Bank and not his Song family stomping grounds.In the end, he could only stare wistfully at Lu Qing'er walking in. Glancing at the box in Li Luo's hands, he indifferently commented, \"Li Luo, there's no need to waste your time. Your Suncreek Villa cannot compete with my clearly superior Pine Nut Villa.\"Li Luo chuckled. \"You might be surprised. Did you ever consider the idea that we would end up in a draw if we fought?\"Song Yunfeng's composed demeanor was instantly shattered, his face a steel green as he furiously glared at Li Luo. If looks could kill, Li Luo would have been shredded into a thousand pieces!Li Luo, on the other hand, ignored him, directly walking into the room with Cai Wei.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A tall and well-built middle-aged man with an imposing aura was sitting opposite him.This was the Song family's Head, Song Shan.They were clearly in the midst of a discussion when Lu Qing'er led Li Luo and Cai Wei into the room, directly interrupting their conversation. Song Shan was slightly taken aback by these new proceedings.However, once he saw Li Luo and Cai Wei, the smile on his face receded slightly and his expression turned a little apathetic.President Lu was similarly astonished, but before he could speak, Lu Qing'er gently said, \"Second Uncle, the people from House Luolan are here.\"When he noticed the look in his niece's eyes, his lips twitched slightly as though he wanted to say something. Despite the sudden developments, he reacted quickly and started nodding his head. \"Since you're here, why don't you quickly take a seat?\"Song Shan immediately placed the teacup in his hand on the table with neither too much nor too little force and frowned at President Lu. \"President Lu, could you kindly explain what is going on?\"President Lu chuckled and replied, \"The Song family's head need not overthink things. Our Golden Dragon Bank believes that harmony breeds wealth after all. At the same time, we also have another condition: that is the goods sold by the Golden Dragon Bank must be of certain quality.\"\"First-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights can be considered lower in grade, but we also require them to be of the highest quality. Otherwise, our reputation would be tarnished. Hence, we will have to do a final selection.\"Li Luo and Cai Wei immediately took their seats and nodded in agreement. \"President Lu is truly wise.\"Song Shan's expression turned cold, as if he'd been submerged in freezing water. He indifferently glanced at the duo before removing all pretenses of politeness, whilst playing with the teacup in his hands. \"President Lu, let's not waste any more time. The Suncreek Villa's Azure Jade Spirit Liquid cannot compare with my Pine Nut Villa's Wondrous Sunshine Light. We have absolutely trashed them in the market in terms of sales and performance. The difference in tempering strength is vast, and I'm sure President Lu has already done his own investigations on this. Frankly speaking, there is no one within the Tianshu Province with the ability to produce a first-grade purifying light that can surpass ours. It's impossible. If President Lu feels that the Suncreek Villa truly is the better choice, you can say so directly and the Pine Nut Villa will pull out of this competition.\" Song Shan truly was a bold individual. He had spoken convincingly and without holding back, directly stating the truth.President Lu chortled to defuse the tension. \"Please don't be angry. I am aware of the Pine Nut Villa's high-quality Wondrous Sunshine Light. However, we also have to let others demonstrate their capabilities in the spirit of fairness. If your product is the best at the end of the selections, I will have to sincerely apologize to you.\"Song Shan's expression immediately eased up upon hearing those words, then he continued to banter with President Lu for a bit more. Occasionally, he would glance briefly at Li Luo and Cai Wei, a cold smirk on his face.He knew all about the Suncreek Villa's internal situation. For a long time, the position of president had been left unoccupied. Yan Lingqing and Zhuang Yi were constantly scuffling, neither willing to give in, and chaos roiled the villa. In the end, Li Luo had been sent to the Golden Dragon Bank to compete against their Pine Nut Villa. That brat clearly couldn't fathom how high the heavens were. Did he really think that his position as a Young Lord was worth anything?Song Yunfeng was sitting next to Song Shan, expressionlessly watching the show.Lu Qing'er, on the other hand, was standing beside President Lu. She was a slender beauty, looking pure and sweet, a completely different sort of beauty compared to the mature Cai Wei.Unfortunately, her gaze held a trace of doubt and worry. She understood that if Li Luo was unable to bring out first-grade spirit liquids that were at least comparable, there would be no chance of her Second Uncle choosing the Suncreek Villa.On top of that, Song Shan and Song Yunfeng would only look down on them even more.Once President Lu placated Song Shan, he immediately looked towards Li Luo and Cai Wei. \"The two of you should also understand the Golden Dragon Bank's requirements. First-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights might be considered low grade, but we require a minimum tempering strength of 55%. Anything less than that will not be considered.\"Cai Wei gave a confident smile. \"President Lu, the Pine Nut Villa's Wondrous Sunshine Light have a tempering strength that barely reaches 56%, is that right?\"\"Barely?\" Song Shan's eyelids twitched upon hearing her derogatory comment. \"General Manager Cai is truly arrogant. If I recall, the Suncreek Villa's high-quality products barely reach 52%.\"\"Well, as the head of the Song family, you ought to know that this is all in the past.\" Cai Wei smirked.Li Luo immediately placed the box he had brought atop the table, revealing the 40 bottles of Azure Jade Spirit Liquid for all to see.\"President Lu, let me introduce you to our newest product from the Suncreek Villa. This is our enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid. It's tempering strength is 60%,\" Cai Wei announced in a gentle and soft tone.\"60%?\" Both President Lu and Song Shan's expressions fluctuated greatly, the former looking very surprised, the latter coldly smiling.President Lu waved his hand and an attendant arrived with a tempering measurement needle. After inserting it into the liquid of one of the bottles, the group closely scrutinized the result as it stabilized at the 60% mark.\"It really does possess 60% tempering strength,\" President Lu said in shock.Song Shan indifferently replied, \"The Suncreek Villa truly has many tricks up their sleeve. The only question here is which third or fourth-grade resonance artificer produced this Azure Jade Spirit Liquid? Could it have been one of those two fourth-grade resonance artificers of the Suncreek Villa?\"President Lu was lost in thought for a brief moment. A first-grade spirit liquid was extremely low-grade. If a few third or even a fourth-grade resonance artificers opted to lend a hand to refine this, then attaining a 60% tempering strength spirit liquid would not be hard. However, wasting a skilled resonance artificer's time to produce such a spirit liquid would essentially be a huge loss for the Suncreek Villa.Using their time to create third-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights would be significantly more efficient in terms of value, vastly surpassing the profits first-grade spirit liquids could bring.Song Shan's subtle meaning was that the Suncreek Villa was willing to go to any means to achieve their goals, even if they had to get their third-grade resonance artificers to refine a batch of these spirit liquids and purifying lights.President Lu turned to look at Li Luo. \"Young Lord, you must understand that what the Golden Dragon Bank requires is not just a single batch. These orders will continue over an extended period of time. If the Suncreek Villa is unable to reliably produce spirit liquids of a similar tempering strength, that would not be pleasant for any of us.\"Song Shan indifferently drank two sips of tea. He obviously did not believe that the Suncreek Villa had the ability to consistently produce Azure Jade Spirit Liquid with 60% tempering strength. Could they really afford to constantly sacrifice the time of third-grade resonance artificers to refine these low-grade goods? If they truly did so, it would just be a matter of time before the Suncreek Villa collapsed due to their foolishness.Li Luo faced President Lu's questioning gaze directly, remaining as calm as before. \"President Lu, please rest assured. House Luolan is a big family with big businesses and corresponding interests. We would not act foolishly over such a small matter. We wouldn't be so foolish as to use our third or fourth-grade resonance artificers to refine such low grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. This is something House Luolan would never do. If President Lu chooses to purchase our Azure Jade Spirit Liquid, I can guarantee that the Suncreek Villa will be able to produce this reliably in the long run. Additionally, the tempering strength will be no lower than 60%. In fact, all of the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid produced by the Suncreek Villa will be of the enhanced version. We will produce the best first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights in the entire Tianshu Province!\"Looking at how calmly Li Luo had responded, President Lu felt his heart quaking. Could it be that the Suncreek Villa could reliably improve the quality of their Azure Jade Spirit Liquid without relying on the assistance of third-grade resonance artificers? Li Luo had given his guarantee on it!He wasn't the only one who was shaken by this fact. Song Yunfeng and Song Shan were equally shocked by this revelation. Li Luo was simply too confident, and it looked like he was speaking the truth.Even Song Shan started to question himself. Did the Suncreek Villa's Azure Jade Spirit Liquid have some sort of breakthrough in quality?How could this be possible!?Just half a month ago, the Suncreek Villa's Azure Jade Spirit Liquid could barely reach 52% tempering strength. How could it have improved so greatly in half a month's time!?If that was not the case, then how could Li Luo declare so confidently that they would be able to produce this enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid for the long run?The entire room was plunged into a brief period of silence. Lu Qing'er, on the other hand, was looking at the box of spirit liquids with renewed interest. She was surprised too, and she had a strong feeling that this had to do with Li Luo.President Lu's plump hand grasped a bottle of Azure Jade Spirit Liquid and he paused in deep thought. A few moments later, his face burst out into a smile and he looked at Song Shan. Apologetically, he addressed him. \"Song family's Head, I believe we are temporarily unable to cooperate with you.\"Song Shan did not burst out in anger upon hearing those words. Instead, he placed his teacup down and gave a resigned smile. \"President Lu, I believe we will have further opportunities to collaborate in the future. Since you've made your decision, we will take our leave. Haha. If the Suncreek Villa's goods ever have issues, please come and find our Pine Nut Villa instead.\"Song Shan truly had the grace and magnanimity expected of a family head. He was not put down by Li Luo's ambush and instead even gave Li Luo a smile. \"The Young Lord is young and capable. I heard that you even managed to fight my son to a draw during the preliminary examinations. It looks like House Luolan will be in good hands. I'm sure that it will have a limitless future.\"Li Luo courteously replied as well. \"It was merely a fluke.\"Song Shan simply smiled, no longer speaking, directly leading a glum Song Yunfeng away.Once the two Songs took their leave, President Lu made his way to Li Luo with a hearty smile. \"I've heard from Qing'er that you've resolved your issue with the blank palace. That is truly a cause for celebration! But before that, why don't we sign an agreement regarding the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid?\"Cai Wei immediately took this as her cue to walk forward and directly settled the conditions with President Lu.Whilst the two were busily discussing the terms, Li Luo stretched lazily. Lu Qing'er walked over at this moment. \"Congratulations.\"\"It's all thanks to you. Otherwise, things might have gotten dicey.\" Li Luo thanked her sincerely. Without Lu Qing'er's help, the Song family might have signed the contract with the Golden Dragon Bank before they got a chance to hawk their wares. The situation would've been extremely tricky in that scenario.Lu Qing'er waved her hand and reminded him, \"However, you need to put in more effort. Don't forget about the College Final Examinations that are coming up. The biggest regret will be if you miss out on the opportunity to enter the Astral Sage College.\" Li Luo nodded in agreement.All of a sudden, Lu Qing'er spoke out. \"Are you free during this holiday? I have no one to spar and exchange pointers with. If you're free, come and spar with me. It's mutually beneficial.\"\"Do you take me for a sandbag? No, no, no...\" Li Luo hastily said. He was speechless! How could this even work out? Upon hearing his reply, she gave him a faint smile and glared at him for a good few seconds before swiftly turning to leave........Outside the Golden Dragon Bank, in the Song family's carriage.Now that there was no one else around, Song Shan's expression turned incomparably gloomy. The Suncreek Villa had indeed been heavily suppressed by their Pine Nut Villa in recent times. Who would have expected them to counterattack with such a vicious blow, directly slapping them across their faces?Although the cooperation with the Golden Dragon Bank would not be significantly profitable, the crux was that it would raise the reputation of their Wondrous Sunshine Light. It would further cement their position in the Tianshu Province's first-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights market.However, it had all been ruined by Li Luo.\"Dad, can the Suncreek Villa reliably produce Azure Jade Spirit Liquid with 60% tempering strength?\" Song Yunfeng couldn't help but ask.Song Shan gave an insipid reply. \"We will have to wait and see.\"\"This is truly a vicious blow. We've paid a huge price to tap into Elder Sister's connections and invited an expert resonance artificer to improve upon our Wondrous Sunshine Light's formula. In the end...\" Song Yunfeng lamented.\"This is just first-grade purifying lights.\"Song Shan shook his head. \"Even if the Suncreek Villa wins this battle, they will not be able to win the war against the Pine Nut Villa.\"Your elder sister has already sent news that she's about to return to the City of Southwind. At that point, she will directly take over the Pine Nut Villa and we will naturally be victorious.\"Song Yunfeng revealed a look of excitement. His elder sister, Song Qiuyu, was a student of the Astral Sage College's Resonance Tempering Hall with outstanding achievements. With her support, the Pine Nut Villa would truly have a pillar to rely on.\"The most important thing now is the College Final Examinations. I hope that you will be able to regain the face that you've lost,\" Song Shan stated coldly.\"I will bring you with me on a trip to the Governor's Mansion for the next two days. Shi Huang, the son of the governor, is Eastpool Academy's number one student and also the same age as you. Perhaps the two of you can get along and become fast friends.\"\"Governor's Mansion?\" Song Yunfeng was a little startled at this. Shi Huang was Southwind Academy's greatest fear in the upcoming College Final Examinations. With his background as the son of the governor, he was the most influential individual in the Tianshu Province amongst the younger generation. He was head and shoulders above everyone in terms of background, with the exception of Li Luo.Of course, that would only be the case if House Luolan was in its golden era.No one would speak of Li Luo and Shi Huang in the same breath, whether in terms of influence or background. They were seemingly miles apart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Time is tight! We even have to make up for the gap left by the first-grade refining workshop...\"Upon sitting down, he immediately looked at Li Luo with a smile. \"I seek your understanding, Young Lord.\"\"It must have been hard on you,\" Li Luo replied courteously upon seeing that fake smile of his. The smile on his own handsome face never lessened. After all, the problem in the Suncreek Villa would be finally solved today, and it would then continue to churn out endless profits for him! That way, he could buy even more spirit liquids and purifying lights... Why would he not be excited?Zhuang Yi felt a little uneasy upon seeing Li Luo's wide smile. However, he did not take this feeling to heart. Although Li Luo was the Young Lord, he wasn't in charge of anything, and technically Zhuang Yi was someone from Pei Hao's side. Li Luo could not easily get rid of him without rhyme or reason.Elder Zheng Ping was also in attendance as he was equally curious about why Li Luo would want to convene a meeting. As almost everyone was here, he started to speak. \"Young Lord, please kindly enlighten us as to why you have gathered everyone here.\"Li Luo smiled. \"It's not about something frivolous. Elder, you did mention previously that the lack of a president posed a problem for the Suncreek Villa.\"Zheng Ping was a little startled at how things were proceeding, and he immediately frowned. \"Did we not come to an agreement before? We will compare the results of the ones in charge of the refining workshops to decide the victor. Unfortunately, Vice President Yan seems to be at a significant disadvantage.\"\"Does the Young Lord want to change the rules for selection? These are the ironclad rules of the Suncreek Villa. Even though you're the Young Lord, you cannot change these rules on a whim! That's improper,\" Zhuang Yi said.The rest of the management did not speak a single word. However, the expressions on their faces seemed to say that they were siding with Zhuang Yi.Faced with everyone's doubtful glares, Li Luo waved his hands. \"The rule is wonderful. There is no need to change it. I just want to say that the results are now out for everyone to see.\"The confusion in the eyes of everyone present continued to deepen. Even Zhuang Yi was a little taken aback before he gave an excited smile. \"Does the Young Lord want to crown me as the victor? Or did Vice President Yan take the initiative to give up?\"Upon hearing these words, the group of senior resonance artificers seemed to suddenly understand something. It was true that based on the rules, Zhuang Yi's third-grade refining workshop vastly outperformed the first and second-grade refining workshops. With such a huge difference, it was possible that Vice President Yan would have chosen to give up.\"Give up? In your dreams!\" Yan Lingqing's eyebrows arched in contempt as she gave a cold smile.Cai Wei lightly chuckled at this point. She took the agreement out and directly passed it to Elder Zheng Ping. \"Our Suncreek Villa has signed an official contract with the Golden Dragon Bank. We will produce Azure Jade Spirit Liquid for them on a long-term basis.\"After glancing through the document, Elder Zheng Ping's expression suddenly changed. \"Azure Jade Spirit Liquid with 60% tempering strength? Are you messing around? How can the Suncreek Villa supply Azure Jade Spirit Liquid with 60% tempering strength?!\"Elder Zheng Ping's face turned green and he slammed his palm against the table. He stared at Li Luo as he said in a heartbroken tone, \"Young Lord, how could you possibly have signed such an agreement? You're practically destroying the Suncreek Villa's reputation by agreeing to this!\" Everyone in the discussion hall looked at the trio in shock after they heard the words spoken by Elder Zheng Ping. They would never have expected them to come up with such an unbelievable contract! This was not a joke! The Suncreek Villa's first-grade resonance artificers could not refine such a spirit liquid!Even Zhuang Yi was flabbergasted, but internally he was jumping for joy. He didn't even have to act, as Li Luo had just dealt the death blow to Yan Lingqing himself.Azure Jade Spirit Liquid with 60% tempering strength was simply impossible for the first-grade resonance artificers!\"Hai...\" Zhuang Yi heavily sighed as he raised his voice towards Cai Wei. \"The Young Lord might not be knowledgeable, but how could the General Manager make the same mistake?\" He then turned his gaze to Elder Zheng Ping and the rest and emotionally said, \"Are they possibly hoping for our third-grade refining workshop to take on the task of refining all these Azure Jade Spirit Liquids? This is clearly a ploy to destroy the Suncreek Villa! I will never agree to this! Elder Zheng Ping, you've seen for yourself what these people want to do. The Suncreek Villa has to quickly select a president. Otherwise, if things proceed this way, we will no longer be welcome in the Tianshu Province!\"Li Luo silently looked at the passionately speaking Zhuang Yi, not putting a halt to his words. After Zhuang Yi finished his outburst, he turned over to look at Elder Zheng Ping with a steely, green complexion. \"This contract will not require the help of any of the Suncreek Villa's third-grade resonance artificers. It will be completely fulfilled by the first-grade refining workshop.\"Elder Zheng Ping frowned as he said with a grave voice, \"Young Lord, our Suncreek Villa's first-grade refining workshop simply does not possess this capability.\"\"That was in the past.\" Li Luo gave an indifferent smile as he picked up a box that was sitting by his feet. Upon opening it, he revealed dozens of bottles of enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid.\"Elder Zheng Ping, this will be the enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid produced by our Suncreek Villa. The tempering strength will be at least 60%, and 40 bottles have already been provided to the Golden Dragon Bank. The remaining ten are here for you to see. In the future, we will be producing a greater quantity of this enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid, up to a total of 300 a month. Based on their market value, the first-grade refining workshop will outperform the third-grade refining workshop.\" Each of Li Luo's words directly reverberated around the discussion hall, shocking everyone into silence.Everyone looked at him in complete stupefaction. It was as if they were enthralled by a bunch of fantastical tales.\"Enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid? What is that? I've never heard of this! Our Suncreek Villa's first-grade refining workshop can produce Azure Jade Spirit Liquid with 60% tempering strength? What kind of crap are you spouting!?\" Zhuang Yi resentfully shouted, his tone impolite.Perhaps he was feeling restless at the change of events.However, Li Luo's calm and collected demeanor didn't make him seem like someone who was spouting crazy words.The rest stared at each other blankly, while Elder Zheng Ping remained deep in thought. He immediately took out a tempering measurement needle and directly pierced it into one of the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid bottles.The result was clearly at the 60% mark.Everyone's eyes widened at the sight of the mind-boggling results.\"The enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid was not refined by Vice President Yan. The first-grade refining workshop has been sealed for the last few days, but it will be open to everyone later, for you to see for yourself if you wish. Nothing that the Young Lord has said is false. All of the Azure Jade Spirit Liquid produced by the Suncreek Villa in the future will reliably be at 60% tempering strength.\" Cai Wei's soft and gentle words seemed to echo in the huge chamber.Even Elder Zheng Ping was left in a daze. He could not imagine how this was possible. However, the facts in front of him spoke for themselves. This was not a farce, and Li Luo had no need to come up with an elaborate lie to trick them.Elder Zheng Ping finally recovered a while later, heavily sighing with a bitter smile. \"If what you say is true, the first-grade refining workshop will outperform the third-grade workshop. In this case, I hereby proclaim that Yan Lingqing will lead the Suncreek Villa branch in the Tianshu Province as the...\"\"I DISAGREE!\" a visibly frustrated Zhuang Yi screamed as he angrily slammed the table.\"There is definitely something strange going on. How can the first-grade refining workshop reliably produce 60% tempering strength Azure Jade Spirit Liquid?\"Elder Zheng Ping's expression turned solemn. \"It doesn't matter if you disagree. At the very least, there is a contract with the Golden Dragon Bank proving their point.\"Zhuang Yi's expression turned green. \"I don't believe this! It's impossible! How can they reliably produce this enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid!?\"Li Luo immediately stood up and lifted the curtain at the front of the discussion hall. From where they stood, they could observe what was happening in the first-grade refining workshop. At the moment, there were first-grade resonance artificers busily refining spirit liquids. At the same time, someone collected the recently refined Azure Jade Spirit Liquid and brought it over to the discussion hall.When the box of enhanced Azure Jade Spirit Liquid was displayed in front of the group, no one doubted Li Luo's words any longer. How could they when the evidence was right in front of them?Zhuang Yi's face turned incomparably pale as he plonked onto his seat, continuously murmuring to himself.Everyone knew that Zhuang Yi had been on the cusp of victory. Yet the unimaginable had happened and his fall from grace was just too quick...That stubborn old man Elder Zheng Ping, on the other hand, had a face full of smiles. He stood up to make an announcement.\"From here on, Yan Lingqing will become the president of the Suncreek Villa in the Tianshu Province!\"Applause rang out in the discussion hall. Li Luo heaved a sigh of relief whilst leaning against a chair.This entire fiasco hadn't been easy. On the bright side, at least his money bag was safe for the time being...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was when Li Luo saw the true extent of her drinking stamina.Even more terrifying was Cai Wei matching her cup for cup heroically. The two were flushed from their relentless drinking, and Li Luo was left cowering in fear like a little quail.\"Li Luo, as long as you can increase that secret art watersource support, I will definitely be able to make the Suncreek Villa's spirit liquids and purifying lights the best in the whole Tianshu Province!\" Red-faced and pumped full of liquid courage, Yan Lingqing turned a fiery and beautiful eye to Li Luo.\"Of course. I will do my best.\" Li Luo smiled and nodded. He was only at the Seventh Seal Stage. If he could reach the Resonant Master Stage, the quality of his resonant power would rise correspondingly. At that time, he would be able to provide even better watersource.If the Suncreek Villa could dominate the spirit liquids and purifying lights market in the Tianshu Province, then House Luolan's annual profits would soar, allowing Li Luo to rise.\"Well then, a pre-emptive toast. To the Suncreek Villa's monopoly in the Tianshu Province.\"Cai Wei gave a coy smile. The alcohol had relaxed her already pretty features, giving them a different but equally alluring look.The three touched their cups together with smiles.......After helping Yan Lingqing settle the Suncreek Villa's internal dispute, Li Luo felt a weight lift from his chest. In the following days, he was seen less often at the Suncreek Villa.As the holidays were soon ending, Li Luo had another important matter to consider: the College Final Examinations.The College Final Examinations would determine who would be nominated to enter the Astral Sage College. As the most elite college in the Xia Kingdom, it was the holy grail for many young men and women.No power in the Xia Kingdom dared to look down upon the ability and status of the Astral Sage College. Before the Xia Kingdom had been founded, there had been other dynasties. These dynasties had come and gone, and still the Astral Sage College endured, a testament to its deep-rooted power.There were also rumors that there were King Stage experts in the Astral Sage College.That was why even being the Young Lord of House Luolan was nothing compared to being an Astral Sage student. For Li Luo, there was no other option to secure a brighter future.Besides, there was that promise with Jiang Qing'e.The College Final Examinations would encompass all of the middle and high schools, and each would be able to send their 20 finest students to compete for places at Astral Sage.The number of places varied year on year, but generally speaking, the top 10 were more or less guaranteed to make it in, while things were less certain for the remaining.Therefore, Li Luo's target was to make it into that secure top 10.\"Reaching the top 10... won't be easy.\"Li Luo's face was creased with worry as he sat in the skygold room, having just finished his training. Although Southwind Academy was the best school in the Tianshu Province, that was no reason to dismiss the other schools. Although most of the other schools' candidates were indeed largely not worthy of consideration, there would be a few capable ones amongst them, and those would add up to a considerable number indeed.Besides, there was also Southwind Academy's greatest threat and rival, Eastpool Academy.One could only imagine how hard it would be to break free from the cutthroat competition.Li Luo was at the Seventh Seal Stage, and his waterlight resonance should reach the sixth-grade before the examinations. Still, it made him restless with worry.He was improving, but so were the others.Li Luo could not afford to take these examinations lightly.He focused seriously on his own abilities and techniques, and discovered a shortcoming.His most glaring weakness was the lack of a powerful offensive technique. Previously, against Song Yunfeng, he had managed to run rings around him and used his Water Mirror Art to fight him to a draw. Impressive as it was, all the more did it declare Li Luo's lack of an offense. He did not pose a threat to Song Yunfeng in their fight.But this was not a problem limited to Li Luo, rather it was a challenge that all water resonance users faced. It lacked the destructive punch of the fire, metal, and lightning resonances.Of course, the water resonance held the edge in drawn-out battles, but that was too passive a style for Li Luo's taste. He had to think of a way to improve his offense.Other water resonance users might be stumped, but not Li Luo. He was not just a pure water resonance user, he was the ultrrare waterlight resonance user!Coming out of his musings, Li Luo got up and left the skygold room, heading for his private library.......Governor's Mansion, City of Southwind.Every citizen of the Xia Kingdom fell under the purview of the governors - the Governor's Mansions were therefore the centers of power and influence.\"Keke, my old friend Song, I have been wanting to invite you to the Governor's Mansion for some time now. A pity that I was just too busy recently and couldn't make time until today.\"From within the guest hall of Governor's Mansion, bright laughter. Its source was a gaunt middle-aged man. Although he was smiling, he had an authoritative bearing about him.This was the governor of the Tianshu Province, Shi Qing. He was a Heavenly Dipper General, the first sub stage of the General Stage.In a lower position near him sat the head of the Song family, Song Shan.\"The esteemed Governor is always busy, of course you would not have time like us idle peasants,\" Song Shan replied laughingly.\"Brother Song, you mock me.\" Shi Qing smiled in response. He lifted up his teacup and looked at the leaves floating on the surface. He remarked casually, \"The Song family's movements have not been discreet lately. You must have enjoyed much at the expense of House Luolan.\"Song Shan replied, \"All thanks to the great Governor.\"\"A pity, House Luolan. If those two had not disappeared, House Luolan might well have led the five Great Houses in the future.\" Shi Qing smiled humorlessly.\"Well, the brightest candles burn quickest. If not...\" He suddenly paused.\"House Luolan is floundering to keep its head above water. May the Song family treasure every opportunity,\" he said while looking at Song Shan.\"Many thanks to the governor for his instruction. Our Song family will definitely remember your grace.\"Shi Qing smiled and then changed the topic.From the nearby lake outside the guest hall, Song Yunfeng listened to the faint murmur of voices within and then cast his eyes towards the water.There was a white-clothed youth there, his hair trimmed short, save for a long ponytail at the back. His hands were full of fish food, and he was busy feeding the fish.After he was done, he dusted off his hands, then a maid respectfully offered a cloth. He casually wiped his hands and then came walking towards Song Yunfeng.As he neared, his features came into view - an ordinary-looking face, with a ghost of a smile hanging on his lips.But looking at this unremarkable-looking youth, a slight tingle of trepidation shot through Song Yunfeng.This was the governor's son, Shi Huang.He was also the top student at Eastpool Academy.\"Yunfeng, my father has said that in this year's College Final Examinations, I have to help Eastpool Academy take the title of best school in the Tianshu Province,\" Shi Huang said with a smile.\"With senior brother Shi Huang's abilities, it seems entirely probable,\" Song Yunfeng replied.\"Not at all. Your Southwind Academy's Lu Qing'er is no slouch. She will make a formidable opponent,\" Shi Huang said.Song Yunfeng nodded in agreement. He knew of Lu Qing'er's strength.\"Although I do not fear her, I dislike unknown factors. Therefore, I might need your cooperation on some matters regarding the College Final Examinations,\" Shi Huang stated mildly.Song Yunfeng's face changed, and he frowned, troubled. \"Senior Brother Shi Huang, are you asking me to betray Southwind Academy?\"\"Sheesh, you make it sound so ugly. Do you really think of Southwind Academy as your own family? It is but a stepping stone in our journey of cultivation. As long as you clinch a top 10 spot, you'll naturally be able to advance to the Astral Sage College. At that time, will you even care about Southwind Academy?\" Shi Huang chortled.\"Anyway, don't worry. I won't ask you to do anything too noticeable.\"He sketched a casual gesture in the air. \"It is also my father's will. The dean of Southwind Academy had a feud with my father in the past. He tried to stop my father's rise at every turn. Therefore, the golden title of best school in the Tianshu Province must be taken away from him.\"Song Yunfeng thought about this for a long time, and finally nodded in a pained way.Only then did a warm smile fill Shi Huang's face. He reached out and gently patted Song Yunfeng's shoulder. \"Oh, and I hear Li Luo has a resonance now? And you two fought to a draw?\"Song Yunfeng's eyes clouded upon hearing those words, and he said stiffly, \"He pulled a fast one on me, that's all. If we meet in the exams, he has no chance of even a draw.\"\"I see...\"Shi Huang pondered for a moment. \"A pity. I wanted to test the young lord during the examinations. But hearing that from you has dulled my interest considerably.\"\"There is no need for Senior Brother Shi Huang to trouble himself with such a brat. If the opportunity presents itself, I will clean him up,\" Song Yunfeng said.\"Just as well.\"This person... I haven't met him many times, but I have quite the dislike for him,\" Shi Huang snorted.Hearing that raised Song Yunfeng's suspicions.Seeing his reaction, Shi Huang laughed, and he said resentfully, \"An ugly matter. Back then, my father went to House Luolan, seeking Jiang Qing'e's hand for me...\"Haha, in the end, the two House Lords rejected him.\"How dare they... They wanted to keep her for their son...\"A pity their son grew up so useless. How can he hold on to such a fine woman?\"Song Yunfeng was taken aback when he heard these words. Now he finally understood why the governor's family had moved in secret to support the revolution and help them devour House Luolan. So this was why...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0043\u2013 Sixth Grade Waterlight ResonancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Li Luo was left with his last three bottles of fifth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights, his waterlight resonance finally evolved, reaching the sixth grade.In his bedroom, Li Luo sprawled on the carpet, a wild look of triumph on his face.Less than a month before, Li Luo had been written off with his blank palaces, his future bleak. And now, his unique waterlight resonance had reached the sixth grade.Resonances had nine grades, and a sixth-grade resonance was above average, no matter how you looked at it.One more upgrade and he would be well and truly in the high-quality resonance tier.Besides, the waterlight resonance's unique nature meant that its sixth-grade power was comparable to that of some seventh-grade resonances. Therefore, just in terms of resonant power, Li Luo had already caught up to many of his excellent peers.As far as he knew, only Lu Qing'er and Song Yunfeng had seventh-grade resonances in the whole of Southwind Academy. And even within their generation in the Tianshu Province, the number of seventh-grade resonance users could be counted on one hand.Even with a ninth-grade resonance monster like Jiang Qing'e eclipsing his achievement, Li Luo knew that a seventh-grade one still had its own noteworthy shine.Ninth-grade resonances were extremely rare. Why else would the Astral Sage College open a special recruitment for Jiang Qing'e?The Astral Sage College's requirements were very strict. They had seen more geniuses than carp in the Yangtze River, so even an ordinary genius would not move them to open their doors so readily.Li Luo raised his palm. A blue resonant power condensed on his fingertip. The resonant power was pure, and the refreshing sound of waves came floating forth.He could feel that his resonant power had become more solid and pure after advancing his waterlight resonance.He was not far from the Eighth Seal now.The blue resonant power finally coalesced into a ball of water about the size of a fist. He flicked his finger, and the waterball shot forth. It smashed into the wall with startling ferocity and created an explosive flash of light, dazzling an unprepared Li Luo momentarily.He chuckled. This resonance art was not at all unusual. It was a very common mid-tier art. When hit, the water resonance power would enter the target's body and then their speed would take a hit. However, this move lacked offensive power, and did not deal much damage.Therefore, Li Luo had fortified and improved this mid-tier resonance art. He had infused light resonance within it. The resulting water bullet was not only faster, but could also release a blinding light to distract his opponent.Therefore, he renamed this improved Water Bullet Art to Waterlight Bullet.In order to prepare for the College Final Examinations, Li Luo had made all kinds of efforts, and refining the Waterlight Bullet was one of them.Li Luo turned around, and the last three fifth-grade spirit liquids caught his eye. He sighed deeply.In less than a month, his waterlight resonance had jumped two grades. This was an astonishing speed indeed, but Li Luo knew that the blistering pace was about to grind to a halt.Unlike the fifth-grade ones, he could not buy sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights by the hundreds.Considering the price, a fifth-grade spirit liquid cost about 5,000 gold, whereas a sixth-grade spirit liquid might reach 30,000 gold\u2026Besides, going from the sixth grade to the seventh grade was a milestone leap. It was the cross from a middle-grade resonance to a high-grade one. Therefore, the amount of spirit liquids and purifying lights needed was incredible.If he assumed that he needed 200 spirit liquids and purifying lights, that totaled to six million gold, which was roughly a year's income for the whole of House Luolan.And given that House Luolan was rife with problems both internal and external, it was impossible to expect six million gold to be pulled out to support him.Besides the financial limit, there was also the question of supply. As far as Li Luo knew, perhaps only ten sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights would appear on the market in the Tianshu Province each month. Therefore, he felt that it was simply impossible to bring his resonance to the seventh grade here.Unless he went to the capital of the Xia Kingdom.Looking further ahead, if he wanted to bring his acquired resonance to the ninth grade, the capital required would be staggering. Even all of House Luolan's resources would be insignificant in comparison.It seemed like this acquired resonance was going to be quite troublesome indeed.Of course, his blank palaces meant that he could also absorb lower grade spirit liquids and purifying lights, although they would be less effective. However, now that he had a sixth-grade one, imbibing the fifth-grade liquids would be several times less effective compared to sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. Therefore, doing so was not going to save him any money in the grand scheme of things, but they could be an emergency replacement.Li Luo's heart was heavy as he thought through this, but luckily, that was not the only special card he had up his sleeve. When he entered the Resonant Master Stage, he would be able to fill his second resonant palace with a second resonance.Therefore, even if he was crippled by a lack of funds, the second resonance might well help him move forward nonetheless.Besides, only when he filled his second resonant palace would Li Luo's unique advantage truly shine through.\u201cMy single sixth or seventh-grade waterlight resonance might lose to your ninth-grade resonance, but what if I had two resonances? Three?\u201cIf I can't beat you with one, I'll just increase the numbers!\u201dThis advantage would probably serve him well against any opponent under the Duke Stage, unless he met some other super genius who had managed to realize their second resonant palace before reaching the Duke Stage. Still, those were probably as rare as his blank palaces, right?Besides, even if he did meet them, it was still going to be three resonances against two.His mind in a muddle, Li Luo gave a loud, retching cough to try and quash the scattered thoughts. At the same time, he pulled out a piece of blue jade. On it was written a new energy cultivation art, which Li Luo had personally chosen for himself.The Black Waterfall Breathing Technique was a high-grade cultivation art, and required the user to have a sixth-grade resonance.It was more refined than the Azureflood Meditation Diagram that Li Luo had cultivated previously. Besides, with his improved water resonance power, it would allow his resonant power to surge forth even more explosively than when he used the Azureflood Meditation Diagram. This was exactly what Li Luo was looking for.Li Luo carefully read the Black Waterfall Breathing Technique. When he felt the first glimmers of understanding, he began cultivating it.For the next two days, Li Luo devoted most of his energy to the cultivation of the Black Waterfall Breathing Technique. The day before the holidays ended, Cai Wei sent someone to inform him that the resonant artifact he had asked them to help forge was finished.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her egg-shaped face made her seem even prettier than a flower, a wide smile on her face.However, Li Luo saw her often, so he was completely immune to her charm. He shifted his gaze to what was important: the iron box atop the table nearby.He vaulted across without hesitation, instantly ripping the cover of the box off. Within the box rested two short blades, both glinting with cold light.They were roughly a third of a meter in length. One had an azure-colored handle with a wavelike ripple pattern on it, reminding one of the waves of the sea. The other had a dull-white handle which was supposedly crafted from Sunspirit Metal, able to produce piercing light when the sun shone upon it.These two shortswords were crafted with metals that contained water resonance power and light resonance power respectively. They would serve as effective conduits through which Li Luo could channel his unique resonant power, further amplifying his capabilities in battle!The hilts of both blades looked like the mouth of a beast, fangs bared, an extremely intimidating appearance.When looking at these blades as a whole, they possessed a more obtuse arc than usual, looking slightly bent. Yet this didn't take away from the fact that they gave off a feeling of exceptional sharpness, cold light seemingly flowing through the blades themselves.Li Luo immediately grasped the dual blades, gently engaging in a sword dance in an attempt to get a feel for them. All of a sudden, a wind-rending sound could be heard when Li Luo swapped to a backhanded grip in the blink of an eye. His posture and actions made him seem extraordinarily dashing and elegant.\"Not bad,\" Li Luo contentedly said while nodding his head. \"The azure one will be known as the Ripple Blade, while the other will be known as the Flare Blade,\" he casually stated.\"These are just standard resonant artifacts. They have not reached the level of treasures.\" Cai Wei's perspective of things were at a higher level, and she could easily discern the quality of these weapons. Although they possessed a slightly special shape, their true worth was not exceptionally high.Resonant artifacts also possessed different grades to differentiate their qualities. There were ordinary resonant artifacts, and those that surpassed them in quality were known as treasured artifacts.There was a stark difference when one compared treasured artifacts to resonant artifacts. Treasured artifacts were significantly more powerful and rarer than resonant artifacts. Additionally, each and every one of them was astronomically expensive.On the other hand, treasured artifacts required a certain amount of resonant power before they could be utilized. Li Luo was currently at the Seventh Seal Stage, so even if he had one, he would be unable to demonstrate even a fraction of its true might.\"This is good enough. Once I reach the Resonant Master Stage, I will look for a suitable treasured artifact.\" Li Luo smiled. His two resonant artifacts had been crafted purely for the College Final Examinations.\"Thank you, Elder Sister Cai Wei,\" Li Luo said with gratitude.Cai Wei waved her hand. \"I believe your final examinations should be starting soon. The City of Southwind seems to have become much more bustling in recent days. The numerous academies within the Tianshu Province have already dispatched their elites here.\"The yearly College Final Examinations was a significant event that attracted countless people. The huge battles were an exciting topic and the atmosphere was often lively.Li Luo nodded. \"There are three more days till it begins.\"Cai Wei's beautiful gaze held a trace of concern. \"Are you confident you will do well?\"Although Li Luo had finally awakened his water resonance, it was relatively late compared to the rest of his competitors. Hence, Cai Wei was unsure if Li Luo would be able to make up for this difference during such a short span of time.She was extremely clear of the importance of being able to attend the Astral Sage College. If Li Luo was able to qualify, his influence and prestige would soar. At the very least, some of the people within House Luolan would no longer look down upon him, and he would even be able to bear some of Jiang Qing'e's burden.He sheathed the dual blades by his waist, his palms caressing the handles of both weapons as his face let out a contented smile.\"You can rest assured, Elder Sister Cai Wei. I cannot lose.\"If he was unable to accomplish even this step, annulling the marriage would just be a pipe dream!...The holidays finally ended.Li Luo returned to the academy, and both him and Zhao Kuo were summoned by Xu Shanyue almost immediately.\"You've reached the Seventh Seal Stage?\" Whilst chatting casually, Li Luo discovered that Zhao Kuo had also managed to enter the Seventh Seal Stage during this holiday, eliciting surprise.Zhao Kuo only had a fifth-grade resonance, which was very average. Being able to reach the Seventh Seal Stage demonstrated his tireless effort and the endless suffering he must have endured to attain this result.The massive, bear-like Zhao Kuo scratched his head and laughed. \"I didn't return home this holiday and stayed in the academy to cultivate. The academy provided me with some special training that allowed my last minute efforts to reap this success, allowing me to break through.\"\"During these past ten days, Zhao Kuo has been cultivating as though his life depended on it!\" Xu Shanyue, who was leading the two, chuckled whilst he heard them banter. He had clearly recognized Zhao Kuo's diligence and hard work during this period of time.Li Luo immediately gave him a thumbs up. \"Amazing.\"\"How can I compare to you? You're handsome and endowed with such perceptiveness when it comes to resonance arts. Now that you've awakened a water resonance, it's very likely you will become a legend in Southwind Academy, much like Sister Qing'e!\" Zhao Kuo said honestly.\"Even when I'm famous, I will still be friends with you! You're truly the most honest person I've met, and you never lie. Even though you're a little uncool...\" Li Luo nodded and sighed emotionally.\"Of course! I will need Brother Luo to look out for me during this final examination.\"\"Easy. Once I'm in the top position, I will directly drag you into the Astral Sage College.\"\"Wow how tyrannical!\"\"...\" Hearing their shameless bragging, Xu Shanyue's face turned a little gloomy before turning around to snap at them. \"Quiet, you fools. We're here.\"Li Luo and Zhao Kuo immediately snapped to attention and stopped spouting their nonsense. Ahead of them was a patio where quite a few individuals were roaming around. These were the top 20 in Southwind Academy.Li Luo recognized Lu Qing'er, Song Yunfeng, and Difa Qing's familiar silhouettes.Currently, the group was staring at the two in amusement. They had clearly heard all of their nonsense while they were bragging proudly\u2026Despite the ridiculing gazes that the group was giving the two, Li Luo's demeanor was indifferent and unshaken. As long as he didn't feel embarrassed, the ones who would be feeling the heat were the ones that mocked them!Zhao Kuo, on the other hand, had a simple and honest smile on his face, demonstrating his ineffable and cheerful personality.In the end, the group only shook their heads and went back to what they were doing.These two had the thickest skins they had ever seen.Li Luo was clearly a little in over his head. He had previously barely managed to eke out a draw between him and Song Yunfeng, and now he was claiming he would take first place? He hadn't even asked Lu Qing'er for her opinion!Within the group was also the old dean. His gaze was filled with mirth as he shot a glance at the duo. Seeing that everyone had arrived, he said, \"It looks like everyone is here. Since that is the case, I will now explain the rules of the final examination.\"Everyone trembled when they heard those words. They all immediately focused on each and every word the old dean was about to say.\"The College Final Examinations will officially begin in three days' time. The twenty of you will represent Southwind Academy as the representatives. I only have one request, and that is to defend the title of the best academy in the Tianshu Province! Additionally, the Astral Sage College has announced that fifty students from the Tianshu Province will be selected to join them during this round.\"The group seemed to have become more tense upon hearing this. Fifty spots meant that there were several fewer positions than the previous year. In this case, the competitors would undoubtedly struggle even harder than before.\"As per the previous round, the top ten in the College Final Examinations will automatically receive the opportunity to join the Astral Sage College. The remaining forty positions will be distributed amongst the top ten academies. The academies in the eighth, ninth, and tenth position will be allocated one slot each. fifth, sixth, and seventh will receive two slots. Third and fourth will receive five slots, with second place receiving six slots. Finally, the top academy will receive fifteen slots!\"When the last sentence was uttered, it instantly caused a hubbub to erupt. No one had thought that the College Final Examinations would allocate such a significant share of slots to the top academy.Even in previous years, although the top academy would receive more rewards, it had never been as unbalanced as this.Teacher Lin Feng from the First School had a face full of smiles and encouragement as he looked at Lu Qing'er. \"Qing'er, in order for the academy to obtain the position, we require your help to take first place.\" The old dean nodded as he looked warmly upon her.Their hopes were pinned on Lu Qing'er. This was also normal as she was the trump card of Southwind Academy.Under their ardent gazes, Lu Qing'er remained as calm as before, only lightly replying, \"I will do my best to fight for victory.\"The old dean nodded and then informed her, \"However, you must keep an eye out for Shi Huang of Eastpool Academy. He is extremely strong and will be your key rival.\" Upon hearing that name, Lu Qing'er's expression became slightly grave and she attentively nodded.\"From tomorrow onwards, you will no longer have to come to the academy. Instead, you will head to Whitespirit Garden. That is the location where the numerous academies of the Tianshu Province will gather. In three days, you will enter Whitespirit Mountain. That will be the battleground for the final examinations.\" After this last series of exhortations, he summarized his parting words.\"Southwind Academy has been led by this old man for dozens of years. Its honor is more important than my life. Hence, I sincerely hope that all of you will do your best during this final examination to preserve the honor and reputation of the academy.\" The old dean's face was dignified as he gave a final bow.The twenty students were immediately taken aback by this development, quickly returning one as well.In the end, the old dean waved his hand to dismiss the group, leaving everyone with mixed emotions.Li Luo walked out of the patio, staring wistfully into the blue sky, feeling his heart lightly surging.The College Final Examinations had finally arrived.It was a pity his parents weren't around to see this...If they really were... perhaps they would be looking at him disapprovingly and saying something along these lines...\"This son is just too dumb. Completely different from our brilliant Qing'e!\"It was said that when Jiang Qing'e took her final examination, she completely suppressed each and every student from every other academy. She was so dominant that they wouldn't even dare to let out so much as a fart without hiding in fear. No one would dare to infringe upon Southwind Academy's prestige.Only when she finally entered the Astral Sage College did the numerous academies of the Tianshu Province begin to rile up in celebration, tears filling their eyes.Compared to Jiang Qing'e's blinding resplendence, Li Luo had encountered all sorts of ups and downs.In fact, just a month ago, no one even held any hopes of him participating in the final examinations\u2026Thinking of all this, Li Luo's excitement tampered down a notch, as though someone had dumped a bucket of cold water over him.\"Just what is the meaning to all this?!\"\u00a0he lamented.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had been the location for many College Final Examinations before this.On the second day, Li Luo and the others prepared to head to the Whitespirit Garden together, led by Lin Feng and Xu Shanyue.They were greeted by a huge crowd milling around. Many stalls had organized themselves into long avenues that stretched out endlessly. It was a bustling sight.However, this was to be expected. A major event such as the College Final Examinations might only formally involve the elite students of each school, but in reality, everyone had an interest in it. Everyone wanted to see which young brave would leap ahead of the pack and become the foremost leader of the new generation in the Tianshu Province.It was the highest honor.As they filed into the Whitespirit Garden, the atmosphere heated up a notch, the cacophony of the crowd greeting them from all sides. Their arrival was immediately noticed\u2014the reputation of Southwind Academy in the Tianshu Province was quite something after all.\"These are the top 20 from Southwind Academy?\"\"Wow, that long-haired beauty must be Lu Qing'er. I heard she's the best in Southwind Academy.\"\"She's probably going to get first place in the College Final Examinations this year.\"\"Maybe not. Eastpool Academy's Shi Huang is also unreasonably strong. I don't think he's any weaker than Lu Qing'er.\"\"Which is Southwind's Li Luo? I heard Jiang Qing'e is his fiance. Disgusting. How dare he sully my goddess.\"\"There! The handsome one. That's Li Luo.\"\"Money, status... he's the Young Lord of House Luolan.\"\"Hmph. Not impressive, family power. The respectable youths build their own reputation.\"\"I heard he fought the second-place Song Yunfeng to a draw in the Southwind Academy preliminaries.\"\"Damn, you're irritating. Shut up, will you?\"\"...\"Snatches of speculation occasionally floated across to the ears of the Southwind students. Both Lu Qing'er and Li Luo were featured prominently in the gossip, the former for her ability and the latter for his special reputation.A ways away, there was a stone pavilion on an elevated ground. Three figures could be seen within, eyes locked onto the Southwind contingent as well.Two young men, one young woman.One of the young men was strappingly built, his fiery-red hair especially prominent under the sun. The other was a more scholarly-looking type, and noticeably thin.The young woman was clad in green, a dainty little thing with picture-perfect features. Her most distinctive characteristics were green, vine-like tattoos on the back of her hands.These three were not at all no-namers. The red-haired youth was Xiang Liang, from the Tianshu Province's Dawn Academy. He was their first seed, and a power to be reckoned with.The skinny scholar was Zong Fu, first in Midday Academy.The petite girl in green was Chi Su, first in Dusklight Academy.All three were hot favorites to reach the top ten in the examinations.\"That's Lu Qing'er? Looks strong.\" Xiang Liang's voice boomed out, the fiery battle will in his eyes trained on Lu Qing'er.\"I sense a dangerous aura from her,\" Zong Fu said neutrally, frowning.\"The one ranked first in Southwind Academy has never been an easy opponent. But we have to be glad that we're not in the same cohort as Jiang Qing'e; otherwise, we would be flushed out in a trice.\" Chi Su laughed.Xiang Liang and Zong Fu nodded with deep feeling. \"Jiang Qing'e is a terror. A ninth-grade light resonance is terrifying. I pity those in her batch.\"\"But in this Southwind batch, only Lu Qing'er and Song Yunfeng need watching. We have nothing to fear from the others,\" Xiang Liang said confidently.Although his school could not compare to Southwind, that was precisely why Dawn Academy could concentrate much of its resources on him.Although there were not many like him in the Tianshu Province, he was definitely not the only one. In order to secure such talented students, each school would go to great lengths.\"What about Li Luo? I heard he fought Song Yunfeng to a draw in the preliminaries,\" Chi Su said.Xiang Liang scoffed. \"That's because he used some special move to play for time. In the end, his resonant power was completely spent as well. Another second and Song Yunfeng would have done him in.\"\"A clever trick, but it won't work in these exams.\"Chi Su said a little regretfully, \"A pity, him being so handsome.\"It was the intellectual Zong Fu who reminded, \"Arrogance is a flaw. The fact that Li Luo managed to beat Song Yunfeng shows that there is an odd streak to him. To be safe, there is a need to test his true strength. Only then can all unknowns be negated.\"\"Don't worry about that. I'll think of something.\"Xiang Liang made a face. \"Whatever.\"Chi Su turned. \"Have you two received Shi Huang's message? He wants us to meet him tonight to discuss something.\"Xiang Liang nodded. He was a little apprehensive about meeting the governor's son, the only one who could stand against Southwind Academy's Lu Qing'er in a straight fight.\"That is a reputation we have to respect.\"Zong Fu nodded slightly as well. \"His target must be Southwind Academy, coincidentally ours as well. After all, Southwind Academy has relaxed on their best-school laurels for too long. They always get the most entrance placements. If we can beat them down, that would be good news for all the other schools.\"Chi Su smiled as well. \"If not for such an important person, we would not have been able to join forces.\"Although Southwind Academy was the ultimate rival for many other schools, there was a lot of internal competition amongst themselves as well. Without a strong anchor to rally around, such unity was hard to build.Therefore, Shi Huang's initiative was welcome indeed......Li Luo and the others followed Lin Feng and Xu Shanyue into the accomodations in the Whitespirit Garden. Li Luo was coincidentally matched with Zhao Kuo.The two were tidying up their room when there was suddenly a knock on the door. Li Luo opened and saw a hyperactive face pop up close to him. The person had a book in his arms.\"Buy some information, Brother?\"Those words immediately called to mind the sneaky illegal peddlers hanging around furtively at the gates of Southwind Academy, selling dodgy books.\"Yu Lang, when did you transfer here?\" Li Luo laughed.It was none other than Yu Lang, who had vomited blood in exaggerated fashion after losing to Li Luo.He grumbled, \"This is firsthand information about all the top students from the famous schools. Plus, the top 10 predictions are featured.\"\"Oh?\" Li Luo's brow creased. Quite some foresight on this guy, to know that such information would fetch a pretty penny. And it seemed like he had worked on it for a long time.\"Quite a talent for money-making.\"Li Luo praised him. He bought one out of support.\"Of course. I've put blood and sweat into the information. I guarantee it's useful,\" Yu Lang vowed.Li Luo flipped it at random. The smile on his face froze at seeing his own name.Li Luo, Southwind Academy. Young Lord, House Luolan. Once trash, now a genius on the comeback, seems to have a fifth-grade water resonance. Specialties: Very handsome, but good looks never won anyone placements. Low chance of entering the top 10.Li Luo roared with angry laughter. He was about to unleash his fury on Yu Lang, but the wily merchant was already gone like the wind. A voice came from far away.\"I'm just protecting your information!\"Li Luo gritted his teeth.\u00a0\u201cAs if, you little rascal. Don't let me catch you again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0046\u2013 Road Less TraveledPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter chasing away the irritant known as Yu Lang, Li Luo took the information and went back to his room, carefully pouring over it's contents.However, the more he read, the more attentive he became. He realized that a lot of the information was useful and legitimate.It seemed as though Yu Lang had indeed put in quite the effort. This was not a casual attempt to swindle the naive, but a true repository of knowledge!Of course, with regards to the information on Li Luo, other than him looking handsome, which he begrudgingly admitted was true, the rest was all false!His attention was then focused on the information regarding who was speculated to be the top 10 strongest individuals in this competition.First place, Southwind Academy, Lu Qing'er, upper seventh-grade ice resonance. Suspected to be at the Ninth Seal Stage. Beauty and strength coexist in this female. She has never lost a single battle in Southwind Academy.Second place, Eastpool Academy, Shi Huang, upper seventh-grade lightning resonance. Suspected to be at the Ninth Seal Stage. Likey the only person able to compete with Lu Qing'er. Has the potential to be number one in the final examinations.Third place, Dawn Academy, Xiang Liang, lower seventh-grade fire resonance, Eighth Seal Stage. An elite student nurtured with all of the resources at Dawn Academy's disposal. His strength is not to be underestimated.Fourth Place, Southwind Academy, Song Yunfeng, lower seventh-grade Crimson Eagle resonance, Eighth Seal Stage. During Southwind Academy's preliminary examinations, he was victorious in all rounds save two. One was a loss against Lu Qing'er and the other a draw against Li Luo.Fifth Place, Dusklight Academy, Chi Su, lower seventh-grade Poison Ivy resonance, Eighth Seal Stage.Sixth Place, Zenith Academy, Zong Fu, lower seventh-grade water resonance, Eighth Seal Stage.Seventh Place...Li Luo continued to scrutinize the entire list before sighing in admiration. If he had not read this, he would've still been in the dark, unaware of the Tianshu Province's numerous crouching tigers and hidden dragons. However, this seemed reasonable in retrospect. The Tianshu Province's numerous academies might not have foundations as deep as Southwind Academy, but they still possessed the ability to nurture an elite student or two. Even a blind cat would eventually catch a mouse, and their efforts might one day bear fruit and they might just obtain the top position if the stars aligned. If that happened, their academy's reputation would soar into the skies and all their efforts would bear fruit.Additionally, all of those contending for the top 10 positions were minimally at the Eighth Seal Stage. There were no weaklings amongst them!\"It looks like entering the top 10 will be a challenge,\" Li Luo muttered as he rubbed his chin. He currently had Seventh Seal Stage resonant power and was slightly weaker than those contenders. The bright side was his unique waterlight resonance, which would provide him with certain advantages when push came to shove.If he had to face Song Yunfeng openly again, he would no longer have to resort to his previous methods of trickery and forcing things into a draw.In the top 10, Lu Qing'er and Shi Huang were on a separate level of their own as they were potentially at the Ninth Seal Stage. Both were exceptionally proficient in resonance arts and were likely to be the only two able to win first place.However, Li Luo was also temporarily uninterested in attaining first place. Why? He was simply not strong enough!He had a sixth-grade waterlight resonance, but those two possessed upper seventh-grade resonances. Their backgrounds were also not to be scoffed at, ensuring that they had received ample resources not inferior to his own. Perhaps if the two of them were inanimate objects, he would be able to leapfrog and beat them!Furthermore, he wasn't Jiang Qing'e with a ninth-grade light resonance, able to completely suppress them. Others wouldn't even dare to raise a finger against her!Even when Pei Hao wanted to find trouble, he had to wait till he had reached the late stage of the Earth Fiend Stage. Yet even when faced with the early stage Jiang Qing'e, he found no advantage! From this example alone, one could clearly see how tyrannical a ninth-grade light resonance was.Thus, Li Luo's current goal was to muddle into the top 10 positions of the final examinations. Securing a slot in the Astral Sage College would suffice. He wasn't too interested in being at the top, as it was firstly impossible, and secondly just too eye-catching! It would draw the ire and lust of his enemies! After experiencing what it was like in the past, he had determined that developing steadily in obscurity was the way to go!If the conditions were right, Li Luo wanted to achieve his goal quietly. He wanted to enter the Duke Stage and hold on to his dear life!Furthermore, he only had five years left, and this acquired resonance was like a Sword of Damocles hanging over him, always leaving him in anxiety and unrest.Whilst Li Luo was engrossed by Yu Lang's compiled information, the sky gradually turned dark. Zhao Kuo wanted to grab a bite with him, but when he saw Li Luo's focused expression, he decided to leave him be. He snuck out by himself and planned to bring some food back for him.\"This information is quite comprehensive, and full of useful insights.\" Li Luo, who had finally finished assimilating the information, let out a sigh of praise. After screening through this information, he had a better understanding of the numerous elite students from other academies and their abilities.Additionally, he could sincerely feel that Yu Lang had deliberately left out information on him, to prevent anyone else from making preparations against him. Otherwise, he would have been able to write quite a comprehensive summary on him based on the information that was available, and not just leave that line of rubbish in.\"It seems I've truly made a mistake in thinking badly of Yu Lang...\" Li Luo muttered. At the same time, his stomach began to churn out rumbling sounds and he finally realized that the sky was already pitch black.\"Why is that guy Zhao Kuo not back yet? Does he want me to starve to death and then get the entire dormitory for himself?\" Li Luo questioned.At this point, hurried knocks could be heard on the door. Yu Lang's voice could be heard coming from outside. \"Li Luo! Your friend Zhao Kuo has been intercepted by some individuals.\"Li Luo opened the door with a frown. \"What are you talking about?\"Yu Lang shrugged his shoulders. \"That brat seems to have gotten into an altercation with people from Zenith Academy. The one leading the group is Zong Fu. If you've read my information, you should know who he is.\"\"People from Zenith Academy? What are they trying to do?\" Li Luo asked in surprise.\"Well, Zong Fu has deliberately shown himself. If I said that they are targeting Zhao Kuo, I don't think you would believe me,\" Yu Lang grumbled.\"So they are targeting me?\" Li Luo asked with a pensive look on his face.\"They probably want to feel you out,\" Yu Lang explained.\"I've been keeping to myself this whole time! Just why?\" Li Luo was a little astonished at this development. This Zong Fu guy was in the top 10. Why would he bother with small fry like him?\"It looks like he's being cautious, which totally seems to fit his character,\" Yu Lang explained. Li Luo was truly someone who held a low profile. His most outstanding achievement was being able to force a draw against Song Yunfeng.\"Well, since he dares to bully my brother, I don't care who he is! I won't take this lying down!\" Li Luo said furiously while walking out of his room.Yu Lang scratched his head. Judging by what Li Luo was saying, wasn't he simply being played like a fiddle by his enemies?...At the Whitespirit Garden's western side, a significantly large group had stopped to watch a commotion that was currently taking place, forming a blockade amidst the bustling crowd.In the sea of people, numerous Zenith Academy students had surrounded Zhao Kuo, loudly arguing. Everyone else was watching in interest.\"What's going on?\"\"I heard someone from Southwind Academy molested a girl from Zenith Academy.\"\"Was it really that bad? Where is the girl?\"\"Where? Hmph. The girl was pretty ordinary... Are the people of Southwind Academy so thirsty that they set their grubby hands on every girl they see?\"\"...\"In the midst of the raucous laughter, Zhao Kuo was feeling extremely frustrated. His eyes were ablaze with fury as he physically bashed his way through the encirclement, immediately breaking out into a sprint after that.However, just as he started running, he could feel vigorous resonant power surging from behind him. A frigid palm was placed directly on his back, and the undulations of resonant power directly forced Zhao Kuo's body to come to a halt, unable to move any further.He turned his head and saw an elegant and skinny youth. \"What are you trying to do?\"Zong Fu replied with a wry smile, \"Brother, the situation has not been resolved. You need to get someone from Southwind Academy to give us an explanation about this.\"\"Are you trying to coerce me?\" Zhao Kuo asked gloomily.Zong Fu smiled. \"If Southwind Academy doesn't dispatch someone with enough face to provide an explanation, I will simply have to take matters into my own hands and fix you up. We need to provide an explanation to our fellow disciples after all.\"\"My ass. She looks even manlier than me, and I look like a bear. Who in the right mind would want to molest her?\" Zhao Kuo fumed.Zong Fu ignored him, simply keeping him in place. The crowd who was watching the scene gradually grew in size.As the two continued to exchange verbal barbs, some movement could be seen in the crowd. Zong Fu's gaze lit up with excitement when he saw Li Luo stride in heroically.\"He really came.\"\u00a0Zong Fu started celebrating internally. Now that Li Luo had appeared in person, he would be able to finally get an idea of how strong he really was. He would be able to determine if he was truly a wolf in sheep's clothing... or someone who was worthless.Whilst he was still relishing in happiness, he saw Li Luo immediately turning around to shout. \"This way, Supervisor. This bastard is clearly violating the rules, trying to start an unapproved fight! Quickly catch him and strip him of his right to participate in the final examinations!\"The smile on Zong Fu's face instantly froze and his joy was quenched by a figurative bucket of cold water. He immediately saw a teacher garbed in a supervisor's uniform standing there emotionlessly.\"F*ck,\" the originally refined and polished Zong Fu uttered an unimaginable vulgarity. He would never have thought that this Young Lord would act so... lawfully! The past two days were filled with all sorts of scuffles in the Whitespirit Garden as the numerous students competed against each other in secret. Yet no one would actually utilize the rules to solve their problems! Who had ever met someone who would run bawling to a teacher whenever there was conflict?Wasn't this just too shameless?This Young Lord was truly one that traveled the road less taken.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wouldn't be afraid of Zong Fu, would he?\"\"A fight between students, and he actually went crying to the teacher?!\"\"Right? Eh\u2026 but it does seem like the correct thing, right? Internal fighting is actually against the rules though.\"\"You... you're right, but... but...\" One of the spectators stammered. Of course, the one actually in the right was Li Luo. His decision to call the supervisor was faultless.But why did it just feel so wrong?As they stood around glumly, Zong Fu hurriedly let go of Zhao Kuo, whose back he had been clinging firmly to. He then turned smilingly to the supervisor. \"Mentor, we weren't fighting. Just playing.\"\"You were clearly going to beat me up,\" Zhao Kuo said.Zong Fu flushed as he retorted, \"Impossible! Don't slander me.\"Li Luo stepped forth with an inviting smile. \"Don't worry. Go ahead and speak your true mind. Bravely now.\"Zong Fu forced a smile. \"It was nothing. Nothing at all.\"The teacher sized up the situation and saw the girl from Zenith Academy, built like a bear. He pursed his lips. \"Couldn't find a better one to go for?\"Zong Fu was completely embarrassed. Zenith Academy had always been majority male. Female students were few and far between, and this junior sister was the only girl in their top 20, and she was beloved by all of them.\"You, three hours of standing punishment. One minute less and your dean can come and collect you,\" the supervisor said coldly.In truth, student fighting was rampant, and they always shut an eye on the situation. But now that Li Luo had come to report it, they had no choice but to respond, or they would lose their jobs.The supervisor turned to leave after delivering the punishment.Low snickers came from the crowd, although it was uncertain who it was directed at.Zong Fu stood there, frustrated but afraid to move. Li Luo walked up to him and smiled. \"Did you think I would be so easy to bully? Going after Zhao Kuo to force me out?\"Zong Fu stared at him and then sighed. \"Others said the Young Lord was nothing to fear, but I feel that you were the dark horse of these examinations. I just wanted to test you.\"Li Luo was surprised. \"You see me that highly?\"Zong Fu nodded. \"I know how terrifying Jiang Qing'e is. I don't believe her fiance would be a good-for-nothing.\"\"You've fought Jiang Qing'e before?\" One surprise after another.Zong Fu's shoulders slumped. \"Fought my ass. She stared at me once, and my legs were already numb with fear.\"But Li Luo, seeing you so insistent on hiding your moves has got me very curious about what you are truly hiding. I look forward to your performance in the examinations.\"\"You'll know it when you see it.\"Li Luo smiled and clapped Zong Fu on the shoulder. \"Well then, keep up the excellent standing form. I'm off to sleep.\"He turned and led Zhao Kuo away, their departure followed by many odd glances from others.Zong Fu watched them leave, screwing his mouth up with frustration. Something dawned on him.\"Damn, standing punishment means I can't attend Shi Huang's rendezvous. He wouldn't think I'm a traitor and not showing him face, right?\"......A room, somewhere in the Whitespirit Garden.Shi Huang greeted Xiang Liang and Chi Su with a warm smile, even pouring them tea himself as he spoke to them with great courtesy.The three chatted for a while. Chi Su frowned. \"Where's Zong Fu, that fellow!\"Xiang Liang felt like something was off too. Zong Fu did not seem like the kind of guy to show no interest in Shi Huang. He would definitely show up if he could.Shi Huang's smile did not reach the depths of the dark look in his eyes. Zong Fu would not be slighting him, would he?Just then, there was a knock on the door, and someone entered to whisper into his ear. A look of surprise flitted across Shi Huang's face.He waved the person away, then turned back to the other two with a smile. \"It seems like Zong Fu won't be able to make it tonight.\"\"Why not?\" Both Xiang Liang and Chi Su were surprised.\"He went to suss out Li Luo and ended up getting reported to the supervisor. His punishment was three hours of standing.\" There was an odd look on Shi Huang's face as he said this.\"Huh?!\" both Xiang Liang and Chi Su blurted simultaneously. They looked at each other, not sure whether to be amused or angry.\"Li Luo seems to play against expectations.\" Xiang Liang could not help but chuckle.To even go and tattle to the teacher\u2014was he not afraid of being ridiculed?\"Perhaps he knew he was outclassed by Zong Fu, so it was his only choice.\" Chi Su supplied.\"I already said, there's no need to test Li Luo. He's not the one to watch here. He doesn't warrant such caution.\" Xiang Liang clicked his tongue dismissively.Shi Huang said with good humor, \"Zong Fu's caution is commendable. If met in the examinations, Li Luo should be dealt with, of course. Avoid any accidents later on.\"But he did not seem too bothered by this, instead turning the conversation to the main topic at hand. \"Although Zong Fu is absent, our purpose today will not be delayed.\"We all share the same goal: to dethrone Southwind Academy from its prized seat as the best school in the Tianshu Province.\"And the strongest they have this year is Lu Qing'er. As long as we deal with her, Southwind Academy will lose its first-place title. At that time, the number of entrance slots allocated to them will drop as well.\"My suggestion is simple. In the final stage, we must work together to force Lu Qing'er out.\"Xiang Liang and Chi Su looked at each other. They both saw the doubt in the other's eyes. \"It is not easy to team up against Lu Qing'er. Given her strength, she should still be able to retreat safely. Besides, the final stage will be full of other strong opponents. If we focus too intensely on her, others may slip in and collect.\"Shi Huang smiled slightly. \"Everything has been arranged. You need only appear at the time and place that I have determined.\"The two were silent for a moment, then finally nodded.\"Then it will be as you say. Southwind Academy has led the Tianshu Province for too long. It is time the crown has a new bearer.\"Shi Huang's smile widened as he lifted his teacup.The three toasted each other.\"Well, then. Nice working with you.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course not.It was nothing compared to what he had experienced over the last two years.Whitespirit Garden, Wind Restaurant.Li Luo and Zhao Kuo had come for a meal, but when they went up the stairs, they saw the hall packed to the brim with boisterous young men and women, and the roaring wave of chaos and laughter put them off.\"That's too many people,\" Zhao Kuo murmured.Li Luo agreed. He had just turned to leave when he spotted someone in the distance waving to him, from a seat near the window.He looked more closely. Lu Qing'er.\"Let's go get a free meal out of her.\"Li Luo did not hesitate, making a beeline for the table with Zhao Kuo behind. But as he neared, he saw that Lu Qing'er's table was already seated with Difa Qing and Song Yunfeng.\"Feel free to join, if you wish. There's space,\" Lu Qing'er said, gesturing at the empty seats with her delicately-manicured finger.Difa Qing shot Li Luo a look, but this time it was not followed with her previous sneering. She sat in silence, drinking her water.It was Song Yunfeng who felt more up to his usual belligerence. He felt that they should know better.Instead, Li Luo planted his ass right beside him with a grateful cheer. \"All my dear schoolmates, what a sight for tired eyes.\" Zhao Kuo joined him.Song Yunfeng's expression turned grim. He said sourly, \"Li Luo, I heard you got into trouble again. There are so many other schools here at the Whitespirit Garden now, can you not ruin Southwind Academy's reputation? You're making things difficult for the other Southwind students.\"Li Luo matched his grim tone. \"If you feel ashamed about any of my actions so far, I suggest you quit school as soon as possible.\"This elicited a new wave of anger from Song Yunfeng, and also a slightly upward twitch of Lu Qing'er's lips.Song Yunfeng scoffed. \"Who are you to tell me to leave school, Li Luo? I'm saying this for your own good. Don't think you can go around causing offense to other schools just because of that one draw. You clearly know best how meaningless that was.\"However, Li Luo seemed not to hear him, instead turning to Lu Qing'er, who was hailing over a waiter. \"Help us order a meal, thanks.\"Lu Qing'er did not reply, but she added two decent meals to the order when the waiter came.This infuriated Song Yunfeng even more, the flames of jealousy burning strongly within him. He had never dared to speak to Lu Qing'er in such a casual fashion before, but this bastard Li Luo had done so while ignoring him?\"The examinations start tomorrow. Are you all prepared?\" Lu Qing'er asked, not intending to listen to them sniping at each other anymore.They all nodded, then the topic was smoothly changed.Li Luo did not participate much, concentrating on his meal.But halfway through their meal, he sensed the atmosphere change drastically. He looked in the direction of the change. Someone was approaching.It was a nondescript-looking youth, but the aura he gave off was tyrannic, a cold, cruel air that juxtaposed jarringly against the warm smile on his face. Everyone took him seriously.Eastpool Academy, Shi Huang, son of Governor Shi Qing.After Shi Huang made his way up the stairs, he headed straight for their position, and asked with a smile, \"Excuse me, may I draw up a chair?\"Lu Qing'er's eyes flicked up briefly, then she replied coolly, \"Sorry, we're full.\"Still smiling, Shi Huang took a chair from the adjacent table, who did not dare to object. They recognized him.Shi Huang sat on the other side of Song Yunfeng. \"Qing'er, our fathers are acquaintances. Surely there's no need to be so frosty.\"\"And we are rivals. Surely there's no need to fake any amiability. Tiring, isn't it?\" Lu Qing'er countered.Shi Huang gave a tight smile. \"Both of us are destined to meet in the Astral Sage College. We'll be peers there. Why the animosity?\"Isn't that right, Yunfeng?\" He directed the question sideways.Song Yunfeng nodded quietly.Li Luo was happy with his meal. He put down his bowl and chopsticks, turning to Lu Qing'er. \"Done eating? How about a walk for digestion?\"The tension in Lu Qing'er's neck eased slightly. She knew that Li Luo was helping her defuse the situation. She didn't want to hang around fencing with Shi Huang either.Shi Huang's eyes narrowed. He picked up a broad bean and flicked it with his fingers with a loud crack. It shot forth like lightning, a silver streak aimed straight for Li Luo's face.But just before it landed, an ice-infused chopstick crashed into the lightning-charged broad bean, sending it flying and burying itself deep within a pillar. A small ring of frost covered it.Lu Qing'er looked at Shi Huang coldly, and her frosty aura seemed to swell. \"Shi Huang, stop picking fights.\"The commotion here had stirred up the hall as well. Furtive glances were being thrown their way. When the crowd saw that it was Lu Qing'er and Shi Huang, they were immediately excited. Could it be that the first place hot favorites were going to duke it out here?Sensing the crowd's attention, Shi Huang smiled. \"A slip of the hand... I hope you don't take offense, Young Lord.\"Li Luo shook his head, saying exasperatedly, \"I'm not angry, but you're wasting food. It seems like you haven't been taught well at home. Has Governor Shi not been teaching you properly? If your house is lacking whips, I can send two over.\"Shi Huang's smile did not falter. \"The Young Lord is exactly right. I will be more careful next time.\"\"Recognize your mistakes and change. That's a good boy.\"Li Luo nodded approvingly, then left with Zhao Kuo.Lu Qing'er shot one more frosty look at Shi Huang and then left as well, Difa Qing scurrying in her wake. Song Yunfeng gave Shi Huang a long look and followed.Shi Huang sat down, unperturbed. He scooped up the few remaining broad beans on the table and threw them into his mouth with quick movements, his eyes cold and calculating.\"This Li Luo. Is he hiding his power? Or is he truly powerless? I really want to find out,\"\u00a0He mused to himself, shaking his head with a wry smile.Forget it. A crippled young lord should pose little threat to him. Lu Qing'er was the key to toppling Southwind Academy from their first place title.Still, Li Luo was quite a detestable guy indeed.Seemed like he would have to make some arrangements for his early elimination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0049\u2013 The Final Examinations Begin!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime flew by quickly in the Whitespirit Garden. In the blink of an eye, the final examinations were about to begin.The entire area was swamped by an ocean of people that was steadily growing in size. People from all corners of the Tianshu Province were rushing here to witness the exciting climatic selection!At the foot of Whitespirit Mountain was a viewing platform, currently squeezed full of individuals who were trying to get a view.At the forefront of that area was a spacious and lavish pavilion that was built to house the most influential and respected individuals.A short moment later, numerous esteemed individuals from the Tianshu Province made their way towards the pavilion, including Wei Sha of Southwind Academy and Shi Qing from the Governor's Mansion, attracting the attention of everyone around.As the two most influential individuals in the Tianshu Province, they made their way to the middle of the pavilion, where a luxurious reception was prepared for them.\"Keke. The old dean still looks quite feisty and full of spirit. That's not bad at all!\" Governor Shi said with a face full of smiles.Dean Wei similarly responded with a meaningless smile. \"I heard Governor Shi has been rather unsatisfied with Southwind Academy being at the top.\"\"Just baseless rumors.\" Governor Shi shook his head, unwilling to speak any more about this.Immediately changing his tone, he continued, \"The title of top academy in the Tianshu Province has to be attained with true strength! This is an unchangeable fact. Unless of course\u2026 Southwind Academy falters, then there isn't any other choice, is there?\"Hearing his provocation, the old dean replied indifferently, \"To be honest, when my Southwind Academy's prestige was being established, no one had ever heard of you nor Eastpool Academy...\"Governor Shi had taken over the reins of the Tianshu Province in recent years, and the two had constantly been at odds with each other. One point of contention was Southwind Academy and its reputation. To the old dean, Southwind Academy's reputation was no different from his own child. He would never tolerate anyone who dared to harm it!On the other hand, the Xia Kingdom's royal family would often review the performance of their numerous governors. As the old dean led the top academy in the Tianshu Province, he possessed a significant amount of clout during these reviews. With how often the two were at loggerheads, how could he possibly provide any sort of positive comment? This naturally led to Governor Shi being unable to rise any further in the ranks of officials.As time went by, their enmity deepened, and the verbal sparring today was only an expected result.This year was especially important for Governor Shi. If his performance evaluation was still not up to par, then he would most likely be dispatched to a lower tier county, one significantly weaker than the Tianshu Province.This was also one of the key reasons why Shi Huang wanted to usurp Southwind Academy's position as top academy. They had no other choice.The stark contrast between the icy-cold atmosphere in the center of the pavilion and the surrounding hustle and bustle was jarring. The heads of the Song, Difa, and Bei families were all enjoying the sights and sounds as they chatted gaily.The Golden Dragon Bank's President Lu was also beaming with happiness as he took his place. This final examination was exceptionally important to him as his prized niece would be participating!In another part of the pavilion, Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing had also arrived as House Luolan's representatives. They were very interested in observing how their Young Lord would perform during this trial.As they were also extremely close compatriots of Jiang Qing'e, they treated Li Luo as if he was a younger sibling. With how handsome he was and that growing sense of gravitas, it only added to his charm. Of course, once in a while, he'd be an absolute pain in the ass, just like any younger sibling\u2026\"Do you think the Young Lord will be able to reach the top 10?\" Cai Wei asked as she gracefully leaned against the chair. She slowly peeled a banana, savoring it with light bites.Any male who witnessed this sensuous scene would undoubtedly feel a fire burning inside.Yan Lingqing's slender, jade-like fingers drummed against the stable. \"You vixen! Can't you do things less flamboyantly?!\"\"Well, there's no one else here...\" Cai Wei said, aggrieved. At the same time, she passed over a slice of cantaloupe from the table.\"Why don't you have a bite? It will aid your development into maturity.\"\"You are truly unrepentant! Give you an inch and you want a mile!\" Yan Lingqing furiously shouted. Did she think that she could do whatever she wanted since she was so well endowed?! Immediately taking revenge, she quickly held Cai Wei down with one hand whilst enthusiastically tickling her with the other.Cai Wei was completely thrown into disarray as she trembled with uncontrollable laughter, unable to struggle free. In the end, she could only beg for forgiveness. \"Forgive me! I'm in the wrong! I'm in the wronggggg... aghhhh!\"The pitiful expression on Cai Wei's face was the complete opposite of the usual calm and collected demeanor she maintained when settling the numerous affairs of House Luolan.Yan Lingqing gave a cold snort before finally heading back to her seat. \"Li Luo should have reached the Seventh Seal Stage, and looking at how things are going, it should be quite difficult to attain a top 10 position.\"\"However, if Lu Qing'er is able to attain the top position, Southwind Academy will likely take first place again and obtain 15 extra positions. It is very likely Li Luo will obtain a slot to enter the Astral Sage College. \"Cai Wei gave a light chuckle. \"I personally think that it won't be difficult for the Young Lord to enter the top 10.\"Yan Lingqing gave Cai Wei a surprised look, her eyebrows arched. She simply could not understand where Cai Wei's confidence in Li Luo stemmed from.\"Don't judge him based on how warm and friendly he seems. Entrenched in his bones is a deep sense of pride. Coupled with the fact that he is the son of those two and also the fiance of Qing'e... With his personality, he might not be obsessed with taking the top spot, but I'm afraid he would never be able to accept charity from others. He won't allow himself to have a free ride into the Astral Sage College. Instead, he will struggle for it with all his might,\" Cai Wei explained.\"On the other hand, the most crucial thing is that I feel that our Young Lord is not such a simple person. He definitely has hidden his abilities very deeply.\"The last sentence left Yan Lingqing in deep thought. It was true that Li Luo would often give others an unfathomable sort of feeling. He had manifested his resonance a mere month ago, yet what he had achieved was monumental!\"I hope he can rely on his own capabilities to enter the top 10 and obtain the right to enter the Astral Sage College. The ones that enter the Astral Sage College through alloted quotas tend to be seen differently. Coupled with the fact that he's the Young Lord of House Luolan and Jiang Qing'e's fiance, things will become more than awkward for him. Keke. Now that I think about it, Li Luo entering the Astral Sage College might not actually be a good thing.\" Yan Lingqing polished her spectacles at this point, a look of pity appearing on her face.Cai Wei also gently nodded. She had experienced the trials of Xia City and had a good understanding of the Astral Sage College. At the same time, she was exceptionally clear of how famous Jiang Qing'e truly was. Perhaps saying that she was the center of attention in the college would not be an exaggeration.Li Luo had spent his time till now sequestered in a corner of the Xia Kingdom, the City of Southwind. It was so distant that even the winds would not reach him. Conversely, once he took the initiative to enter the Astral Sage College, he would finally bear and understand the full brunt of Jiang Qing'e's radiance and glory.A weak-willed individual would never be able to survive.As they spoke, the atmosphere in the field seemed to have reached a crescendo. The duo turned to look at the groups of students dispatched by the academies.As they swept through the crowd, they could easily spot the eye-catching Li Luo with a head of silver-grey hair standing in the group from Southwind Academy.\"The Young Lord truly is a sight for sore eyes. Dying his hair truly did make him look more attractive than before,\" Cai Wei casually commented.This was met with a snide remark. \"Psh, just a himbo. Shallow!\" she spat.Despite that, she had to admit that Li Luo truly was blessed with excellent genes passed down from his good-looking parents. No one could pick out any faults with his looks.In front of countless gazes, a figure garbed in a robe that sparkled with starlight appeared atop a high platform. The robe he was wearing was extremely eye-catching, constantly twinkling with silver brilliance.This was the attire worn by the teachers of the Astral Sage College. This esteemed individual was someone dispatched by the Astral Sage College to act as a supervisor for this examination.\"Good day, my students from the Tianshu Province. I am Mentor Anlie, a teacher from the Astral Sage College. Thank you for being here. Without further ado, let me explain how this year's examination rankings will be graded: a point-based system!\" The teacher from the Astral Sage College looked to be around thirty years old. Someone of his age becoming a teacher in the Astral Sage College only demonstrated his excellent abilities.After which, numerous teachers from the different academies began distributing crystal tiles to each and every student.Li Luo and the rest received one as well. Each of these crystal tiles were about the size of their palms, atop was inscribed their respective academy crests as well as their names.\"When the examination begins, all of you here will go through two rounds of evaluation tests. How well you fare in these two evaluations will determine your basic points. Students are forbidden from mutually assisting each other during these two evaluations, but anything after that is fine. Being able to snatch someone else's crystal tiles and basic points will serve as the great divider! Of course, one cannot take their fellow academy mates' tiles and points. Your destination will be in the southwest side of Whitespirit Mountain. That location contains the ruins of an ancient city, also known as Whitespirit Ruins. When you arrive, you will naturally understand the rules.\"After he made the announcement, the faces of all the students gradually turned serious, and the air was filled with a palpable tension.After the last rule was explained, Anlie glimpsed into the sky briefly before breaking out into a resplendent smile.\"I've said enough nonsense for now! Under the authority vested in me, I hereby announce the beginning of the College Final Examinations!\"The moment these words were spoken, the turbid atmosphere seemed to have boiled to a peak, exploding outwards and enveloping everyone.The final examination had finally begun!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was pitch-black within, and it led into the heart of Whitespirit Mountain.Leading the Southwind contingent were Lin Feng and Xu Shanyue. The two waved to their students behind them.\"Let's go.\"As they spoke, the students' silhouettes glowed with an assortment of resonant powers. Finally, they all charged into the corridor.At the same time, the other schools were stirring as well. The tension was electric.The silver-robed Mentor Anlie from the Astral Sage College walked into the pavilion. Both Governor Shi and the dean dipped their heads slightly in acknowledgment. \"Thank you, Mentor Anlie.\"Although Anlie was slightly below them in terms of strength and influence, his title as a teacher and representative of the Astral Sage College demanded some respect from them.Besides, Anlie was young. Although he was just a Silver Spark teacher, he had the potential to rise to the Gold Gleam rank. Once he was promoted, he would be an influential person within the Xia Kingdom.The Astral Sage College divided their teachers into three tiers: Silver Spark, Gold Gleam, and Violet Illumination. The hard requirement for Silver Spark teachers was to reach the Earth Fiend level, while for Gold Gleam teachers the standard was Heavenly Dipper General. The highest ranked teachers, Violet Illumination ones, had to be at the Duke Stage. But even in the arcane depths of the Astral Sage College, a violet-robed teacher was a rare sight indeed.Anlie bowed back smilingly in response. He then sat down. \"Many crouching tigers and hidden dragons sleep in the Tianshu Province. This year's examinations are especially intense. I wonder if Southwind Academy will continue to hold their lead, or if a dark horse will gallop ahead.\"His question was one that neither Governor Shi nor the old Dean could answer. They could only smile politely in response. They then directed their attention to the crystal wall, which was divided into many separate mirrors. When the time came, the photographic rocks embedded in Whitespirit Mountain would stream information to them. At the same time, they would be recording the ranks and points of all the students, updating them in real time.......As the students got fired up outside, Li Luo followed the crowd into the tree-enclosed corridor. He realized that the more they advanced, the more forks appeared in their way. It seemed to be separating the crowd up.With each division, more and more were separated, until those around him were mostly strangers. However, Zhao Kuo was still with him, as well as a few other Southwind students.This continued for a few dozen minutes, before Li Luo and the others finally came to a dead-end, marked by a wooden door.In response to their arrival, the gigantic wooden door began to open slowly.Li Luo and Zhao Kuo shared a look, then they cautiously followed the small party forward.After the last person entered, the wooden door closed and light bloomed within. They saw that they were in an enormous hall, seemingly made completely out of wood, and with a sturdy feel to it.All of them looked about warily, hushed.Li Luo and Zhao Kuo were off to the side, also looking all around them. They had heard from the Astral Sage College teacher that they would first meet two basic challenges to test their foundations. This was probably the first of them.But what sort of test would it be?Just as Li Luo thought this, a sound suddenly came from the side. He looked upwards sharply and saw two yawning black holes above.The voices were coming from within.The voices steadily grew louder, and soon enough everyone was on their guard against the two holes.Squeak, squeak!Suddenly, two streams of black mass gushed out from the holes, the cacophony deafening. It was an unending stream of four-winged bats!These bats were robust-looking. About the size of a person's face, they had a sinister look to them, sharp teeth and claws as well as red eyes.Without any pause, they swarmed the students below.The students scrambled to bring their resonant power to bear, dealing with the four-winged bats in all kinds of manners. It was obvious now that they would have to defend against the four-winged bats for their first test.Li Luo began to channel his resonant power as well. He did not dare to let them get close, and so employed long-range attacks to snipe them out of the air.As the bats continued to grow in number, there was suddenly a shout of alarm from one of the students. They had been slashed across the body by a bat, and their point crystal flickered red.\"Don't let the bats hit you, or your basic points will decrease!\" someone hollered.Some began to panic, having already been hit a few times. Clearly, they would not emerge from this first round with a good score.\"I see.\"Getting a feel for the battle, Li Luo fought in close coordination with Zhao Kuo, fending off the bat attacks from all directions.However, the flock seemed limitless, coming on again and again.Finally, Zhao Kuo roared in frustration, \"I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I'M TOO TIRED!\"Li Luo's gaze swept the field. He saw a wall of four-winged bats, with no gap in between. His eyes flashed. He then seized Zhao Kuo by the hand and dragged him in a retreat to the side.\"Don't move, or my resonance art will dissipate,\" he said, then he called forth his resonant power. A thin veil of flowing light covered their bodies.Under the flowing light, both of their silhouettes began to grow fainter and fainter.\"Is this the Water Shadow Art, a mid-grade resonance art?\"Zhao Kuo was amazed. But as the bats swarmed them, he could not help but question, \"Brother Luo, this isn't going to help. Shouldn't we cut down the bats?\"Li Luo said nothing. He continued to apply his resonant power until both their bodies were glowing in a pool of light.With no response from Li Luo, Zhao Kuo could only grit his teeth and resist the urge to strike out at the offending bats.But just as he braced himself for the attack, the four-winged bats suddenly froze as though they had lost their target. Confused, they finally milled around and turned to attack the others.\"You...\"Zhao Kuo's eyes were bulging. \"You can do that?\"He could not believe it. A middle-grade Water Shadow Art could shield them completely?He looked down and saw that he had turned completely invisible. He marveled, \"Brother Luo, your Water Shadow Art is sick! It's like an invisibility cloak!\"\"Just a simple trick of the eye. It utilizes refraction through water to hide us within the light rays. A small trick. If someone concentrated hard enough, we would be seen...\" Li Luo said without much pride.\"Wow! That's still very impressive. I've never seen anyone use the Water Shadow Art so skilfully before,\" Zhao Kuo praised.Li Luo smiled in response. What he had glossed over was the fact that ordinary Water Shadow Art users could not use it this well. Only he, with his light resonance imbued within it, could affect it thus.\"No need to fight now. Just wait here until it ends,\" Li Luo said calmly.\"Brother Luo, you're not only a handsome face, you're pretty smart behind those pretty looks. The Astral Sage College must be going blind since they didn't extend a special invitation to you.\" Zhao Kuo whooped with good cheer.\"Ha, please! It's going to be our school soon enough. We're so good, they'll open the door for us! No need to worry now,\" Li Luo said generously.\"Wew, and a big heart under that fine brain too,\" Zhao Kuo said. Suddenly with time to kill, he was intending to butter up his dear Brother Luo a little more, when he suddenly spotted a familiar figure being harangued by four-winged bats.\"Brother Luo, that guy looks a little familiar,\" he said.Li Luo looked over and winced. Who else would it be but Yu Lang, screaming as he scrambled away from the bats?\"Hmm...? Him again? Nothing to see here, let's go...\" Li Luo said dryly.Yu Lang was a sixth-grade wind resonance user, and swiftness was his specialty. Although he was yelling desperately, he was still managing to keep abreast of the bats.\"Something's not right, Brother Luo. That dog is charging over to where we are. Does he know we're here?\" Zhao Kuo asked tensely.Li Luo looked. Damn, he was right. What a real pain in the ass.As Yu Lang neared, his ratty little eyes locked onto them. With a terse voice, he called, \"Brother Luo, Brother Luo, save your brotherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\"Li Luo feigned death.\"If you don't save me, I'll attract a whole horde of bats to collide with you.\" Getting no response, Yu Lang immediately threatened them.\"Damn it, Yu Lang, you bastard! Don't you have any morals? Just you wait... Someday, someone will club you over the head when you least expect it. And I can't promise it won't be me!\"Grumbling, he reached out a hand and seized Yu Lang by the shoulder. With a flash, he hid him within the light as well.In the direction Yu Lang had come from, the four-winged bats froze again and then headed off in another direction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were riddled with bloody scars from the bats' claws and teeth, and the crystal tiles on their chests glowed with red light each time they were struck.Only a few stronger students had the presence of mind to join forces, and they suffered only minor losses.While everyone was busy fighting the bats, no one noticed that there were three twinkling silhouettes off to the side, casually dodging the bats as they chatted about the others.\"Haha, look at that guy, his face was almost torn off.\"\"Damn, that was unlucky. His face was savaged. Probably a bad case of psychological trauma in the future?\"\"Pity.\"\"...\"The three watched on with sympathy, and also a little regret that they had forgotten to bring snacks. Munching on melon seeds, Li Luo suddenly shot Yu Lang a look, frowning. \"Can you not come so close? It's gross, you know?\"He was holding Li Luo's hand tightly, and also constantly edging closer. The sour stink of sweat was repulsive.Yu Lang jabbered, \"You're a bad guy. What if you throw me away? Of course I have to hold on tightly.\"Li Luo was speechless. If not for Yu Lang hiding information about him, he would really have kicked him out...\"Brother Luo, is this not a perfect performance? I feel like this deserves nothing less than full marks.\" Zhao Kuo's smile could not be any more smug.Li Luo nodded. They had avoided all the bat attacks. In terms of points, no one could beat them.The three relaxed and watched. After about half an hour, the bats seemed to follow some invisible command and turned away, flocking back to the two yawning black holes in the ceiling.Evidently, the first test was over.Many bleeding and battered students slumped to the floor.From above, a crystalline light beamed through, passing through each student.They saw numbers begin to appear on their crystal tiles.\"Oh? I have a foundation score. 46 points!\"\"I've got 50 here.\"\"Damn, just 20 for me!\"\"...\"A mixture of celebration and sadness rang out through the hall.In the midst of these medley of emotions were a completely devastated Li Luo, Zhao Kuo, and Yu Lang.Their crystal tiles showed a score of 0.\"How is that possible?!\" Zhao Kuo's jaw dropped.\"We perfectly evaded the four-winged bats!\" Yu Lang shouted angrily, feeling cheated.Li Luo pondered it for a moment. \"Could it be that the Water Shadow Art was too good, and even blocked the light? So we were overlooked?\"Zhao Kuo froze. Could it be? Was the Water Shadow Art really that strong?\"It seems like that searching light didn't land on us at all.\" Yu Lang agreed after recalling the moment.The three looked at each other, still dispirited.Who would have thought that this would be the outcome... They had been eagerly awaiting their full-mark distinction, but they had hidden so well that now they were left with zeros.That was too much!\"I won't accept it! I'm going to complain! This is their mistake!\" Yu Lang burst out.Li Luo screwed his face up thoughtfully. \"If we leave now, we'll be forfeiting the exam entirely. Forget it. Zero be it. In any case, the foundational score is just for skirmishing. And there's one more round, right?\"Yu Lang calmed down a little at this, subsiding to an angry mutter under his breath.Li Luo dispelled the Water Shadow Art, and the three appeared. Many turned to them at the flash of light, and there were expressions of shock all around to see the three zeros.Even the worst besides them had a few pitiful points. That was as bad as it got. No one else had gotten zero.What had these three done?Sniggers of laughter soon rang out across the hall.The three of them took it stoically. They were done here, so they moved briskly towards the wooden door that had just opened up at the other end of the hall.Damn, they had been laughing hard a few moments ago, and now the tables had been turned on them. Fate was one fickle mistress....As the trio turned to the next stage, there was a commotion at the foot of Whitespirit Mountain as well.Because on the huge crystal wall, numbers were jumping, and names appeared one after another. All eyes were on it, and exclamations and gasps could be heard periodically.The numbers jumped on for a while, and then finally stopped. Those at the top had a full score of 100.That was the maximum score of this trial.Unsurprisingly, Lu Qing'er, Shi Huang, and a few others were all ranked at the top.The many pairs of eyes continued scanning the list downwards. Suddenly, someone gasped. At the bottom were three strange scores...Even the worst among the students had 1 point, a participation point. 0 meant that they had never even been seen.Therefore, these three zeros immediately sent the spectators into an uproar.Especially when they saw the three names.Southwind Academy, Li Luo.Wasn't that the Young Lord of House Luolan? He had quite the reputation within the Tianshu Province. How had he fallen down to zero?What was going on?\"Hey, the zero wouldn't be the Young Lord, would it?\" Cai Wei's cherry lips parted in surprise upon seeing the glaring score.Yan Lingqing frowned. \"Who else in Southwind Academy is called Li Luo besides him?\"\"How could it be zero?\" Cai Wei did not know whether to laugh or cry. What was happening?Yan Lingqing shrugged. \"How would I know?\"\"But it doesn't matter. These two rounds are just for foundational points. The real decider is the elimination match later on.\"Irritated, Yan Lingqing said, \"This Young Lord sure knows how to make others worry.\"...Within the central pavilion.The old dean, Governor Shi, and Mentor Anlie were also caught off guard by the three zeros.Governor Shi smiled. \"Old Dean, your Southwind students are truly something special.\"The old teacher frowned as he looked at the three names. He felt the beginning of a headache. What on earth were those three pinheads doing? They were an embarrassment.Irritated, he ignored the governor's taunts. This was just the first round. It did not matter that much.However, he hoped that the three hooligans would cut it out in the next pat. Or did they think he was too old to beat some sense into them?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a sinister, gloomy forest with huge trees that stood tall. The dark branches were dense enough to hide the sky and gave one a foreboding feeling.Li Luo and the others looked around them and very quickly spotted a crystal wall before them. This was clearly new.Faintly glowing words flowed across the crystal wall.When they read it, their faces turned serious.\"This stage is about harvesting Spectral Face Fruits.\"A special type of plant known as the Spectral Face Demon Ivy grew in the dark forest. It had an aggressive, violent nature and loved to strangle any life form that drew near to it. It would bury the corpse in its roots and feed on the meat to nourish itself.After a Spectral Face Demon Ivy matured, it would bear a Spectral Face Fruit. The goal of the second round was to gain a Spectral Face Fruit. Those who obtained one would be awarded with foundational points.\"The Spectral Face Demon Ivy is not easy to deal with. The demon ivy is covered with poisonous thorns and is a vicious foe. Realistically speaking, even an eighth-grade resonance user would be hard-pressed to take a Spectral Face Fruit alone,\" Zhao Kuo said worriedly.On the verge of slipping away, Yu Lang froze mid-step. \"I suggest the three of us join hands and get Spectral Face Fruits. What do you say?\"\"You looked on the verge of taking off. Don't let us stop you,\" Li Luo snorted.A little embarrassed, Yu Lang denied it. \"Impossible. We have just been through life and death together.\"Li Luo shook his head. This weasel was hard to trust. However, he did not reject Yu Lang's suggestion. Although he might not be able to get a Spectral Face Fruit himself, having more people might help.If many hands made lighter work, why not?\"Let's go,\" Li Luo said. He led the way deeper into the dark forest, with Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo following close behind.The three walked on deeper into the forest. Several dozen minutes later, they heard a disturbance far away to the right.The three looked around at each other and then headed forward with tacit understanding. Parting the shrubbery, they saw that there was a large, black tree in a muddy patch just ahead. A black vine was coiled around the tree, bristling with black thorns. It thrashed and whipped around like a shadowy python, with enough force to produce a whistling sound.The visage of a sinister face could be vaguely made out on the rough bark of the coarse trunk. It made them uneasy.A Spectral Face Demon Ivy.However, there were already about six or seven figures around it. Clearly, they had joined forces against it. Jets of resonant power flew through the air as they battled the Spectral Face Demon Ivy.The demon ivy was giving as good as it was getting. The poisonous vines whipped out again and again with terrifying strength, and they were frequently rewarded with miserable yelps.\"A sorry sight.\"Yu Lang stared at them. These people were only around the Sixth Seal Stage. Even with numbers, they were still outclassed by the demon ivy.Each time the tendrils hit them, the sickening, whip-like cracks sent prickles of fear down their scalps just from listening. This sound brought back memories of the stick their parents used to beat them with.In just a short amount of time, the group was badly wounded and fled in a wretched state. Luckily, the attack range of the demon ivy was limited; otherwise, they would have been screwed.The trio shook their heads after witnessing the bad trumping.\"Quite a thorny problem, eh,\" Zhao Kuo said worriedly. Although they were stronger than the previous group, it was still not going to be easy to bypass the frenzied and spiky defense to get the Spectral Face Fruit.\"Yu Lang, you go test it out,\" Li Luo said after a moment's thought.Yu Lang pulled a long face. \"What? Why me?\"\"You're a wind resonance user. You're the fastest. Who else?\" Li Luo snorted.Lacking a good response, Yu Lang grumbled and trudged forth. His green resonant power surging forth to bathe his body, he shot forth like a blur, blowing gusts out behind him.\"Oof. Truly the fastest man in Southwind Academy,\" Zhao Kuo hooted with surprise.Li Luo stared at the figure ahead, blurry from his speed. The guy was indeed fast. And it was clear that he had devoted much effort to cultivating speed\u2014a shrewd decision.Sshhh!As Yu Lang rapidly approached, the demon ivy sensed an incoming presence, and the serpent-like vines began to respond.He dodged adroitly, but the closer he got, the more vines were turned on him, as though the demon ivy sensed the threat growing larger. Yu Lang's speed slowed in the face of the harassment, his swagger disappearing.Finally, he chose to retreat. With a flash, he was safely out of its attack radius, back beside Li Luo and Zhao Kuo.\"It's hopeless. I can't even get close, let alone get the Spectral Face Fruit.\" Yu Lang was panting and wiping the sweat pouring from his face.\"On the contrary, I think it's pretty achievable.\"Li Luo smiled smugly. Yu Lang's speed had already pushed the Spectral Face Demon Ivy to the limits of its attack rate. \"Next, we will attack together. Zhao Kuo, up front to tank. I'll support him to suppress the frontal attack of the demon ivy. You go in from the flank to get the fruit.\"\"This means that Zhao Kuo is going to get it real bad.\"Zhao Kuo gave a wry smile. \"Don't worry. I'm all tough skin and hard bones.\"Li Luo nodded in appreciative acknowledgment. Since they were working together, they had to each bring their individual strengths to bear. He was not going to let Zhao Kuo get by without pulling his weight just because he was a friend. Neither would Zhao Kuo accept that sort of favoritism.\"Alright.\" Yu Lang had even less of an opinion.Their simple battle plan laid out, the three did not waste any more time. Li Luo pulled out his two shortswords, and Zhao Kuo loosened the axe off his back.\"Go!\"At Li Luo's whispered command, Zhao Kuo roared and charged, his powerful frame rampaging towards the demon ivy.A faint glimmer of silver resonant power covered him. When activated, his Silver Bear Resonance made his body even more durable and expanded it by a significant margin.Weng!The demon ivy responded promptly, its tendrils snaking out lightning quick, whistling through the air with their speed.Zhao Kuo's giant axe swept in beautiful arcs, a whirling storm that cut down all the vines hurtling towards him. Jade-green liquid spurted everywhere after each swing.Suddenly, the mud below him exploded and vines burst from the ground, binding Zhao Kuo's lower torso.Almost immediately, a slash of blue light cut them apart.Close behind Zhao Kuo's muscular frame was Li Luo, wreathed in his own blue resonant power. His two swords never paused, constantly seeking out the next vine trying to tie down Zhao Kuo.The two steadily drew closer to the demon ivy.But the closer they got, the more violent the demon ivy became. More and more vines stretched towards them, each one whipped up into a desperate frenzy. Li Luo tried his best to cut them down, but some of the vines still managed to lash themselves around Zhao Kuo. He gritted his teeth, uttering not a single sound as deep and bloody streaks appeared on his flesh. He pushed forward. Another step. And another.\"Yu Lang, go!\"Judging the moment, Li Luo yelled out to their flank.\"Alright!\"Already waiting on the sidelines, Yu Lang shot forth upon hearing the command. His speed pushed to its maximum, he pounced toward the Spectral Face Fruit in a flash while the demon ivy was preoccupied with the pair's attacks.Yu Lang was extremely fast. He was close to the Spectral Face Fruit in the blink of an eye. But just as he stretched out a hand to grab it, the soil at his feet exploded. A mysterious stranger shot forth, intent on beating Yu Lang to the fruit.\"Fuck!\"Yu Lang's face tightened as he swore. Someone had been waiting to swoop in!Yu Lang stared, eyes wide, as his prize was on the verge of being stolen from right under his nose. Nearby, Li Luo bellowed, \"Yu Lang, shut your eyes!\"He lifted his hand, his face grim. A blue ball of light formed on his fingertip and shot forth.The blue light ball exploded near Yu Lang and the intruder, shrouding them in an explosion of dazzling light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Closing his eyes would put him in an even more vulnerable state than he already was, with the intruder in his face. But given his understanding of Li Luo, he set his jaw and shut his eyes.As the dazzling light burst out, Yu Lang avoided the blinding effect. Based on his last mental picture, he reached out a hand for the Spectral Face Fruit.However, the intruder caught the flash full on. Their eyes burned, and they could not help but recoil away.The bright light vanished in an instant.The Spectral Face Fruit was in Yu Lang's hand. His face hard, he pulled out a stiletto from his sleeve and charged it with green resonant power before giving it a merciless flick towards the scrabbling figure.\"Hmph.\"Understanding that they had lost, the intruder scoffed and punched out. Yellow resonant power boomed out, clashing fiercely against Yu Lang's attack.The resonant powers exploded against each other. The intruder was only slightly shaken, whereas Yu Lang was sent flying back, sprawling on the ground nearby.The moment Yu Lang grabbed it, Li Luo and Zhao Kuo fled from the demon ivy's attack radius. They barreled over to Yu Lang's side, staring down the shadow ahead.\"Keke, quick movements. Can't believe I didn't snatch that.\" The stranger laughed casually.They could make out that it was a tall, broad-shouldered youth, with a head of short hair. His well-sculpted body announced his barbaric strength. It was an intimidating physique.\"Eastpool Academy?\" Zhao Kuo spotted the crystal medallion on their adversary's chest. The school logo was Eastpool's.\"Eastpool Academy's Lian Zhong. He's second in Eastpool, sixth-grade earth resonance, Eighth Seal,\" Yu Lang immediately recited. Thanks to his compilation and research, he was very familiar with the elite students from the major schools.Li Luo's face was rather neutral. \"Eastpool kids just love to steal stuff, huh? Sounds like a problematic teaching philosophy, if you ask me.\"\"The rules don't say anything about stealing,\" Lian Zhong replied with a cheeky grin.\"Indeed. A hit to your pride though, for sure. You were burrowed for such a long time like a little mole, but you still ended up empty-pawed. Frustrated?\" Li Luo mocked.The cheekiness on Lian Zhong's face evaporated. He had indeed laid in ambush for a long time. He was so sure that he had it in the bag, and had even prepared a few choice taunts. But Li Luo had reacted very quickly to turn the tables on him.\"Li Luo, I've underestimated you.\"Lian Zhong's eyes were on him now. He laughed it off. \"But this is nothing. No need to get all cocky.\"\"You mean you have your eye on me now?\"\"Can't be helped. Boss sent the word out that he's too busy to deal with you, so he asked us to amuse you,\" Lian Zhong said with a sardonic smile.\"Shi Huang?\" Li Luo probed.\"Not much point in fighting here. There's no points to gain from it. After this stage though, I'll come find you when the eliminations start,\" Lian Zhong said.His eyes swept across Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang. \"If you two know which way the wind's blowing, stay away from him. Boss has ordered all Eastpool students to target him. There's nothing but trouble by his side.\"\"Your mom's ass.\"Zhao Kuo glared back at him. \"Can't wait for you Eastpool mongrels to come and deliver us free points on a plate.\"Yu Lang waggled the stiletto in his hand and said in a serious tone \"Li Luo and I are bonded in life and death, we go as deep as the sea. I'll never leave him... unless you have money.\"\"Boring. As you wish.\" Lian Zhong shook his head and left, vanishing into the dark forest.\"Hey, at least give me a sum to work with! We can negotiate!\" Yu Lang called out hurriedly.He was on the verge of chasing, but Li Luo held him back. \"No point tangling with him here. Can't get his points either.\"\"Damn, that was unreasonable,\" Yu Lang fumed. They were unsure if he was angry about the ambush, or the lack of an asking price.Zhao Kuo turned to Li Luo with a worried expression. \"Brother Luo, if the Eastpool kids are really after you, let's go assemble a team of our own.\"If they did not bring their own forces, they would be overwhelmed.\"No rush. Let's see how it goes.\"Li Luo still looked composed. Clearly, Shi Huang was still not taking him seriously, sending lackeys like Lian Zhong. But if that's how he wanted it, it was going to be like attacking dogs with meat buns, all give and no take.Wait, that wasn't right. He wasn't a dog.\"Well, our spoils.\" Yu Lang held out the Spectral Face Fruit.\"Give it to Zhao Kuo first. He tanked the most.\" Li Luo laughed.Zhao Kuo was still covered in bloody lacerations, a woeful sight. But the wounds were all physical, and his sturdy constitution would soon put those to right.Zhao Kuo did not comment, reaching out a hand to take the Spectral Face Fruit. Anyway, he was going to help Li Luo and Yu Lang get their own Spectral Face Fruits.He tore the Spectral Face Fruit apart with his hands, taking out the core within. He squeezed it until a drop of green liquid fell onto the crystal medallion on his chest and was absorbed.The points on his crystal medallion immediately jumped to 100.\"Let's go. Second fruit,\" Li Luo said. The two continued on.In the next hour, the three managed to find two more demon ivies. Repeating their tactic, they were able to get two more Spectral Face Fruits unmolested. Both Li Luo and Yu Lang reached 100 points as well.Now that they were all done with the task, there was no point in getting any more fruits. The three immediately headed for the third elimination round without delay........Foot of Whitespirit Mountain.The crystal wall was constantly shimmering with updates.Many were watching the clips with great interest.The top of the board was filled with full-mark rankers, a whopping 200 points. Of course, it included the likes of Lu Qing'er and Shi Huang.There had been two particularly sensational clips featured on the crystal wall.First was Lu Qing'er. She was standing casually on top of a Spectral Face Demon Ivy, the frustrating vines completely encased in ice. Her long hair flying free, that lithe body and alluring face\u2014the scene was a declaration of the Southwind valedictorian's charms.The second scene was Shi Huang, a smile on his face and a fruit in hand. Behind him, the demon ivy was black and smoking, still sizzling with electricity.These two had beaten their respective demon ivies with pure strength to take their Spectral Face Fruits.A worthy score, and support for them increased. Everyone understood that the first place title was probably between these two now.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing were not too interested in these two. Their eyes were fixed on the lower half of the board. When they saw Li Luo's points jump to 100, they finally sighed with relief.Although this was just for a foundational score, two zeros for Li Luo would have been a fiasco.As more students got their Spectral Face Fruits in their own ways, the mood was starting to pick up here. Everyone knew that these preliminaries were just an appetizer. These foundational scores were for the elimination match.Therefore, the exam would only truly be underway when the eliminations started.....Inside Whitespirit Mountain.Li Luo, Yu Lang, and Zhao Kuo walked out of the gloomy forest. A river appeared before them, and on the opposite bank, there was a complicated terrain of hills and valleys, well furnished with large forests and rocks.They shared a look. Across the river, the elimination arena.They did not hesitate, using their resonant powers to cross the broad expanse of the river. They touched down on the other side, signaling the beginning of the elimination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the two parties made eye contact and then they mutually split away, moving swiftly into the complicated terrain.Li Luo and his friends plunged into a dense forest, with birdsongs coming from the mountains around. Their faces were all serious.\"What are your plans?\" Li Luo asked Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang.Zhao Kuo smiled. \"I initially thought I would get some points first in the elimination round. But now I think I'll stick to you.\"\"Because of Lian Zhong?\"Li Luo said, \"There's no need for that. I'm not too worried.\"\"Brother Luo, you can handle yourself, no doubt. Of course I know you're not afraid of him. I'm just worried they're going to bring a whole gang against you. Although I'm not as strong as you, perhaps I could share some of the load if it comes to it,\" Zhao Kuo said.And then he cracked a bigger smile. \"Plus... points are going to come faster with Brother Luo, eh?\"Li Luo smiled back. He knew that Zhao Kuo was looking out for him for the most part, but he did not pursue the matter further. He nodded to Zhao Kuo.\"And you?\" He turned to Yu Lang.Yu Lang fiddled with his fringe, then said soberly, \"You know what I'm capable of. I can slip through the ranks of this competition like a fish through water. If you are willing to hire me at a high price, I can give you a discount on behalf of our friendship. Just 1,000 skygol- HEY!\"Before he could finish, Li Luo and Zhao Kuo had already walked on, leaving him behind.Yu Lang panicked. \"500 skygold!\"Li Luo still ignored him.Yu Lang burst out, \"If you're not happy with the price, counteroffer, damn it! Some respect please! I wonder which school you learned those disagreeable manners from.\"\"Five skygold.\" Li Luo sketched a careless wave with his left hand.\"Deal!\"Li Luo almost sprained his back laughing. \"Scum, you're really scum.\"Yu Lang said loftily, \"If you dare to ask, I dare to respond. Li Luo, you think you can shame me with five skygold? How naive.\"Li Luo shook his head, but the humor was still in his eyes. He knew that both Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang were truly worried that he was Eastpool Academy's target and that they had chosen to follow and protect him.Despite their vastly different personalities, both were good friends worth keeping.\"I have an idea,\" Yu Lang suddenly said. \"We are too obvious if we move as a trio. I think we should send Zhao Kuo ahead alone. Li Luo will use Water Shadow Art to hide the two of us following behind.\"Li Luo caught on. \"Fishing?\"The bait was going to be Zhao Kuo, a stolid, honest guy that would catch the eye of every dirty player. They were going to swarm all over him for his points.\"Good idea.\"Zhao Kuo chuckled, screwing his face up in an attempt at panicked horror, as though he was properly terrified.\"Zhao Kuo, your acting skills are wasted at Southwind Academy, man.\" Yu Lang stared at him, mouth wide.Zhao Kuo gave him an impertinent bob of the head back in response.\"Settled, then,\" Li Luo decided. The three-man fishing team was formed.......Deep in the forest, the dappled sunlight filtered through the dense canopy.A meek figure skulked through the trees, his eyes darting about constantly. He was the very picture of caution.Occasionally, he would melt back into the shadows and observe for a while before proceeding again.Truly a meek and scared person.Behind this cringing figure, Li Luo and Yu Lang stood in the shadows, well hidden. They were lost for words at Zhao Kuo's immersive acting.\"This man's completely in character now,\" Yu Lang marveled. He thought his own acting skills were quite something, but now he saw that Zhao Kuo was a fellow thespian indeed.Li Luo nodded fervently. He felt that Zhao Kuo indeed had potential. He put a lot of care into the details.\"But the others are cautious too.\"Li Luo looked at one particular shadow. He had discovered some time ago that there were two people watching Zhao Kuo, although they had not made their move. Instead, they had been tailing and observing Zhao Kuo him too.Clearly, they were trying to ascertain if Zhao Kuo's caution was for real.Both had tested Zhao Kuo out many times already, but Li Luo's camouflage still held. Unbeknownst to them, they were the ones being hunted.Li Luo could sense that their patience was waning. Zhao Kuo's acting was extremely natural. He had them hook, line, and sinker.Just as Li Luo flirted with the idea of a proactive action, the leaves rustled and two shadows streaked forward, landing in front and behind Zhao Kuo, neatly trapping him.Zhao Kuo paled. He shouted, \"What are you trying to do? I'm from Southwind Academy! You dare to test me!?\"His performance was world-class. Li Luo and Yu Lang lapped it up from their front-row seats.The two who had appeared were from two different schools. They were not at all weak, both Seventh Seal Stage cultivators.\"Man, we followed you for so long. You're Zhao Kuo from Southwind Academy, aren't you? I saw you in the examination intel... Cut the crap. Hand over your points,\" the two accosters said.\"In your dreams!\" Zhao Kuo yelled. His silver resonant power shimmered into view.Seeing him move, the two did not hesitate in their attack either. Hefting their swords, they shot towards him cat-quick in a pincer movement.A ruthless attack.But just as their attack was about to land, a gentle breeze rustled behind the two.Their hairs prickled. To their horror, the cringing expression on Zhao Kuo's face was gone, now replaced with a smug, mocking smile.\"Damn it, we've been had!\"They realized what was going on and started cursing themselves. They had been very careful in scouting the area. How had they not detected these two?What sneaky behavior!A chill ran through them. They knew that they had walked into a trap. Focusing their resonant power, they attempted to take down the actor, Zhao Kuo. At least with a hostage, they would have some bargaining power.Zhao Kuo saw through them. But he neither hid nor backed down. Instead, a fierce look entered his eyes.His large axe twirled so fast, it made a wheel, and he charged the pair.Dang!The clash of steel sent sparks flying out. Zhao Kuo grunted as he felt the jolt of the shock run through his body. These two were not weak at all. Naturally, came out of the clash in better shape.Still, before they could press his moment of weakness, the two blasts of resonant power caught up to them from behind.HACK.The two spat out mouthfuls of fresh blood and rolled on the floor like freshly plucked gourds.When they tried to rise again, they found an azure-blue short sword and a stiletto resting lightly on each of their necks.\"Brother, one sudden move and there will be blood,\" a light voice sang from beside him.The two looked at each other bleakly. \"Damn, you Southwind Academy students really play dirty. Fishing?!\"\"Hey, if you didn't bite, we wouldn't have caught you.\"Li Luo laughed. He beckoned to Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo to take off their crystal medallions. They cleaned out their points.When their crystal medallions' points drained to zero, an urgently flashing red light followed. And then a beam of light extended out to truss them up tightly.Clearly, they had been eliminated. The light's purpose was to bind them and prevent them from interfering with the competition.After taking their points, the trio did not even bother with parting words, immediately turning to leave. Their conversation drifted backwards.\"Not a bad haul. I wonder who the next unlucky bastard will be.\"\"Hope they're fatter than these two.\"\"But damn, Zhao Kuo, you're a born actor. They followed so cautiously for half an hour, but still fell for it.\"\"Haha, it's nothing. Still some details to polish. I should have added a bit more fear when they appeared to catch me. I think that's more realistic.\"\"Your work ethic is admirable, Sir.\"\"Hey, love the work you do, right?\"\"Well, yes...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Occasional gasps or groans could be heard as they each monitored their own students.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing were also watching their Young Lord's score. When they saw his score increase, both relaxed into a smile.\"The Young Lord is doing his best,\" Cai Wei said coyly, gently fanning herself with an intricate, flower-patterned fan.\"He probably hasn't met any strong enemies yet. As the round wears on, all that will be left are the stronger survivors. Then his true mettle will be tested,\" Yan Lingqing reminded her.Cai Wei's smile was still bright as a flower. \"Still, I believe the Young Lord can do it.\"\"So confident?\"\"Because handsomeness is justice,\" Cai Wei said piously.\"You and your nonsense.\" Yan Lingqing propped her silver-rimmed glasses higher and turned away......In the dense forest.Ting!Li Luo and the others had surrounded one unlucky bastard. Before his desperate eyes, they cleaned out his points, leaving a tearful, dejected slump in their wake.\"We're at 1,500 points already.\"Li Luo looked at their crystal medallions. They had spent most of the morning gathering these points, farming them off a school of greedy and unfortunate fish.\"Seems like the river's running dry though,\" Zhao Kuo fretted. In the last hour, that unlucky chump had been their only catch.\"Word of our fishing reputation's getting around,\" Li Luo said.Their morning of fishing had not gone without its own hiccups. Some fish had slipped away due to their uncommon ability. They would definitely spread the word about the Li Luo Fishing Company.Pre-warned students would not take the bait.\"Well, fishing was never going to get us the win. As more and more people get eliminated, the time will come when we have to fight,\" Li Luo said, unconcerned.Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang nodded. They knew this too.The three were biding their time, even while on the move. They continued a cautious foray forwards, but they soon realized that there was a thin mist building around them the more they moved forward.It started to thicken rapidly.Li Luo paused, frowning. \"Something's off. We're retreating.\"They turned immediately, retracing the path they had come from.After a few minutes, Li Luo turned around and saw that Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo had mysteriously vanished.Li Luo thought for a moment. He searched the nearby bushes and found clumps of a grey mushroom. These fungi were responsible for emitting the disorienting mist.\"Misleading Mushrooms...\"Li Luo gnashed his teeth. The mist from these mushrooms could cause one to confuse directions and even lose track of time and space.Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo must have stumbled off, and now they were lost.\"What a pickle.\"Li Luo stomped down on the Misleading Mushrooms. Although the fog was troublesome, it should be finite. If he waited for it to clear a little, he should be able to find the others.At the same time, some distance away in the fog.Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang were together, and they had also discovered that Li Luo had gone missing. Uncomfortable as it was, they could only advance cautiously.After some time, they heard footsteps from up ahead and perked up happily. Zhao Kuo called out tentatively, \"Brother Luo?\"The footsteps got crisper, and soon a figure appeared before them. Their faces changed.It was not Li Luo. It was, however, a familiar face.The one who had tried to snatch their Spectral Face fruit, Eastpool Academy's Lian Zhong!He smiled coldly at them. \"No Li Luo, but instead the two lackeys.\"Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang wasted no time in beating it. They had walked into his trap, even though it was meant for Li Luo.But just as they turned, two others dropped down into their path of escape, cutting them off.There were four others.And from their crystal medallions, they were all from Eastpool Academy.\"We'll have to duke it out!\" Zhao Kuo's eyes flashed.But Yu Lang raised his hands hurriedly. \"Surrender! We surrender!\"Lian Zhong was taken aback, his lips quickly lifting in a sneer. \"Are Southwind Academy students all this spineless?\"Zhao Kuo bellowed, \"YU LANG! What are you doing?! You think they'll let you off just like that?!\"\"Zhao Kuo, Brother, they're targeting Li Luo. That has nothing to do with us,\" Yu Lang wheedled.\"Damn it, you wretch!\"His face contorted with rage, Zhao Kuo's fist flew out.Yu Lang dodged it hastily, his face a little troubled. \"You're going too far. We're not even Li Luo's actual brothers.\"He turned to Lian Zhong, who was enjoying the show. \"Come on, let me off.\"Lian Zhong snickered. \"Didn't you say you and Li Luo were bonded by life and death or something?\"Yu Lang gave him a sheepish smile. \"A joke. Rhetoric, is all. But if you're willing to let me off, I can help you find Li Luo. He gave us a special way of communication just now.\"Zhao Kuo's eyes bulged as he charged over to bludgeon Yu Lang. But two Eastpool students held him down.Lian Zhong's eyes narrowed. \"And I'm supposed to believe you?\"Yu Lang's eyes were wet. \"If you listened out for information, you would know that Li Luo and I actually have a deep enmity. In the Southwind Academy preliminaries, he was merciless, wounding me deeply. I was bedridden for many days, and even now my body hurts when it rains.\"I was unlucky enough to run into them earlier and was coerced to join up. That's all it was.\"An Eastpool student whispered to Lian Zhong, \"I've heard of this guy before. He's a real money-grubber. He would do anything for profit. He was indeed beaten badly by Li Luo in the Southwind preliminaries. I heard from a friend in Southwind that Li Luo beat him to a pulp. It was so gory, it brought the spectators to tears.\"Lian Zhong frowned. Yu Lang piped up again. \"Actually, I hinted to you previously.\"\"Hinted what?\"Yu Lang gave a sly smile. \"I asked you to up the price... If you did, I would've helped you.\"Lian Zhong started. Indeed, Yu Lang had said that. But how could he have believed it? And yet it was all in character for Yu Lang. Could it really have been a hint?This guy was truly despicable if it were true.Lian Zhong crossed his arms. \"If you can really lure Li Luo here, I'll let you go,\" he said casually.Whether he was lying or not, if Li Luo could be baited here, all was good.Yu Lang leaped up. \"No problem!\"\"Zhao Kuo is good friends with Li Luo. We can use him as a hostage. When Li Luo comes, threatening Zhao Kuo will render him helpless.\"He was even proactively setting up the trap.Lian Zhong could not help but reel a little. \"Aren't you betraying your teammates a little too easily?\"Another sheepish grin from Yu Lang.\"Yu Lang, you good-for-nothing. Just wait! I'll never forgive you!\" Zhao Kuo howled as he struggled.\"Truss him up and gag him,\" Lian Zhong ordered with a wave.Four Eastpool Academy students crowded up to tie Zhao Kuo.Lian Zhong stood beside Yu Lang and placed a chopper on his neck. \"Now, use your communication method to get Li Luo here.\"If he doesn't come, you're both eliminated immediately.\"Yu Lang thumped his chest proudly.\"No worries, Boss. Li Luo will fall for it for sure! When you catch him, please give him a harsh beating on his face. I've suffered beside that devastating handsomeness for all too long!\"Lian Zhong absently reached up to touch his own coarse and plain features. A wave of hatred rose in him.He also hated those pretty boys who had the world eating out of their hands!Yu Lang's words had struck a nerve.Fights could be lost, but pretty boys had to die!And the prettiest of boys like Li Luo had to be cut up into a thousand pieces!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The four Eastpool students struggled grimly to pin him down.Zhao Kuo's face was red from exertion, his tears streaming from frustration. He stared dementedly at Yu Lang as if he wished he could swallow him whole.Seeing such a reaction from Zhao Kuo assuaged the last vestiges of Lian Zhong's suspicions. Relaxing, he was sold by Yu Lang's despicability.That guy didn't have the slightest bit of backbone in him.Still, that suited him just fine.\"Walk. Slowly.\"Lian Zhong ordered. Yu Lang began to shuffle forward obediently.......Within the gradually dissipating mist, Li Luo's eyes flew open.He heard some whistles.He frowned slightly to himself, his fingers tapping against the trunk of a tree as he listened to the whistles.\"Five? Probably Lian Zhong? Unlucky for those two,\" he murmured to himself. Before their fishing commenced, Li Luo had established some simple protocols with the others. One of them was a rudimentary signal system.If such a situation arose, those still free would embark on a rescue operation as soon as possible. If the enemy was too strong, they would enlist the help of other Southwind Academy students.\"Lian Zhong...\"Li Luo's mouth hardened, his fists curling around the hilts of his swords. A cold look crept into his eyes.\"I let you go the other time. Did you think I couldn't deal with you?\"Li Luo turned, heading towards the direction of the whistle without hesitation. He vanished into the fog.......Within the fog, a few figures were slowly moving forward.In front, Lian Zhong was pressed up against Yu Lang. Behind, the four Eastpool students with Zhao Kuo wedged between them.The whistle continued to ring out.Lian Zhong scowled. \"Where the hell is he?\"\"The fog's so damn big,\" Yu Lang grumbled back irritably. \"Maybe he ran really far away?\"\"Hurry up, then,\" Lian Zhong snapped. \"You're wasting our time.\"Yu Lang hurriedly complied, blowing the whistle as hard as he could.Unnoticed behind them, something stirred in the mist. A faint blur of watery light. While all eyes were forward, a palm stretched out from the mist and clamped down over the mouth of the person furthest back. A fist crashed into his temple and then unconsciousness followed.The other three Eastpool students reacted immediately. \"AMBUSH!\"Ahead, Lian Zhong whirled about, angry and fearful. He turned straight into a blue ball of light sailing into his face.Peng!It exploded in a blinding light.Those caught by it cried out and shut their eyes, feeling as though their eyeballs had been stabbed.Zhao Kuo, who had shut his eyes in time, barged his way past three others and disappeared into the fog.\"Fuck, we've been had!\"Lian Zhong swore. In his rage, he swung his cleaver down at Yu Lang.But a slight push off the balls of his feet, helped along by his wind resonant power, and Yu Lang was clear of the swing.\"Haha, a donkey trying to catch the wind?\"Yu Lang taunted him. He also vanished into the mist.Lian Zhong's face was ugly to look at. His yellow resonant power exploded from his body, scything out in the direction that Yu Lang had come from.Dang!A pair of shortswords imbued with blue light countered in response.Lian Zhong gripped his cleaver tightly, staring deep into the mist.Li Luo emerged, twin swords in hand. He was smiling straight at him, Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang flanking him.\"You dare to trick me?\" Lian Zhong glared at Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo. He knew now that there must have been messages hidden in the whistles. He had come, but he had come forewarned, rumbling their ambush and turning the situation.Yu Lang sighed softly. \"Brother, it was not deception. It was just... business!\"He batted his eyelashes at Lian Zhong meaningfully, \u201cYou wanna... up the bid?\u201dLian Zhong's face was red, his breathing labored and his eyes wild.\"Hey, this guy is pawing like an enraged bull. Should we retreat? The mist is going to fade soon,\" Yu Lang said anxiously.Li Luo did not budge. \"Retreat?\" He laughed. \"I took great effort to get this big fish to bite. I'm not about to release it.\"Yu Lang's jaw dropped. \"Did you smear lard all over your eyeballs? Are you seeing this guy? Eighth Seal, and he has three helpers with him.\"\"You two handle those three. No problems, I assume?\" Li Luo asked.\"You're for real?\" Yu Lang was sobering up real quick.Li Luo's eyes were locked on Lian Zhong. He nodded lightly. \"He's worn on my patience long enough. It's about time he paid the price.\"Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo looked at each other for a long moment before finally nodding slowly.\"Just as well. I've wanted to take down these bastards for a while now.\" Zhao Kuo's eyes lit up with pleasure. His axe whooshed a few trial swings.On the other side, the angry Lian Zhong was in disbelief.\"You're not running?\" He could not understand it.Li Luo had gone to great pains to save Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang. They should be fleeing into the mist now, the most rational of options. But Li Luo seemed ready to fight him.Did his handsome looks absorb all his brain cells?Hefting his cleaver, Lian Zhong swished it lightly through the air. He turned to Li Luo, and the smile on his face hardened cruelly.\"Li Luo, don't think I won't dare to lay hands on you just because you're the Young Lord or something. If you lose here, the only one that falls is House Luolan.\"Li Luo smiled slightly. \"Don't be too quick to jump to conclusions. It's embarrassing when the tables turn, you know?\"\"Oh? You think you're that good?\" Lian Zhong sneered. He beckoned to the other three. \"Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo are yours. I'll deal with Li Luo.\"The three complied. Seventh Seals, three on two\u2014there was nothing to be afraid of.\"We'll go first. Take care of yourself. Give us the signal if you're out of your depth, and we'll find a way to extricate,\" Yu Lang assured him in a low voice before bounding after Zhao Kuo in another direction.The three opponents followed.As they drew apart, only Li Luo and Lian Zhong were left here now.Lian Zhong looked at Li Luo with a mixture of disdain and cruel pleasure. This time, he wasted no more words. His yellow resonant power burst forth with the skill of an Eighth Seal cultivator.An intimidating presence indeed.\"Li Luo, too late to regret now!\"\"Watch me turn your face into minced meat!\"As he shrieked his laughter, Lian Zhong surged forward, his blade gleaming with yellow light as it delivered a brutal chop towards Li Luo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0057\u2013 Water Edge ArtPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhoosh!Lian Zhong was not holding back. His Eighth Seal resonant power was fully utilized now. A menacing, yellow blade arced towards Li Luo.Li Luo had no intention of dodging at all. Instead, he lifted himself up to the balls of his feet and darted forth like an eagle. His two swords were in hand, swirling blue with his water resonance power.Dang!When the swords met, resonant power boomed out, the aftershock rippling through the leaves.Lian Zhong's face whitened. Li Luo was completely unfazed by his Eighth Seal power. He could not suppress Li Luo in a clash!\"Impossible! He should only be a Seventh Seal!\"\u00a0Lian Zhong was alarmed!\"Seems like the Eighth Seal doesn't count for much.\"Li Luo let a grin show. With his waterlight resonance at the sixth-grade, plus his resonant power at the Seventh Seal, an Eighth Seal would not trouble him as much as Song Yunfeng had during the preliminaries.\"I'll make you eat those words!\" Lian Zhong shouted with a vindictive hysteria. His resonant power again surging forth, he chopped and cleaved in a frenzy.But Li Luo was faster. His two swords in hand, blue light pulsed out as he twirled them, a continuous attack that pressed Lian Zhong hard.Fury in his eyes, Lian Zhong had his hands full dealing with it.Dang! Dang!The two fought for dozens of rounds. The clashes of metal rang out through the forest.But as the battle wore on, Lian Zhong felt that the intensity of Li Luo's attacks and resonant power only grew more vigorous.\"The Nine Layered Jade Waves? That's a high-grade water resonance art!\"\u00a0Lian Zhong paled. This water resonance art would gradually accumulate power as the battle wore on. Once it reached peak strength, he would be hard-pressed indeed.Lian Zhong was a veteran in battle. He immediately called upon all his yellow earth resonant power, imbuing his sword. \"High-grade resonance art, Earth Slash!\"He brought his cleaver down and split the earth in a yawning gap. But still Li Luo's blades twirled, and waves of sword light continued to wear away Lian Zhong's attacks.\"Trying to stop my Nine Layered Jade Waves? Seems like you're not strong enough.\" Li Luo chuckled.Lian Zhong's face was grim now. He could not understand what was happening. Li Luo was clearly only a Seventh Seal. How could he be this strong and hard to deal with?In their previous clash, he could clearly sense that there was something odd about Li Luo's resonant power. It could stand up against his earth resonance power surprisingly well.It seemed like Li Luo's resonance was of a high grade.But from the information he had, wasn't Li Luo's resonance only a fifth-grade? Why was it so hard to deal with?While Lian Zhong was flustered, Li Luo only grew sharper as time wore on.Nine Layered Jade Waves' power was built up now. Time to counterattack.Li Luo's azure-blue power had reached its peak. The light on his Ripple Blade also glowed bright as it chopped down towards Lian Zhong's chest.A punishing blow.Lian Zhong had to be wary of Li Luo's explosive counter. The built-up power of the Nine Layered Jade Waves was not to be taken lightly.He took a deep breath, summoning up his yellow, earthy resonant power. With a roar, he molded it a shimmering armor of light.\"High-grade resonance art, Earth Armor!\"A faint, yellow armor shimmered into existence around him. It looked reassuringly strong\u2014defense was the specialty of earth resonance users after all. Lian Zhong no longer dared to underestimate Li Luo. He had best bring all that he had to the table.Weng!The blue slashing attack landed against the armor of light and caused it to shudder violently. Cracks appeared, and Lian Zhong himself was sent stumbling back a dozen steps, until he crashed heavily against a tree trunk.He felt a stinging pain in his chest, but also relief. Thanks to his sturdy armor, he had managed to defend against Li Luo's attack.\"What a solid shell.\"Li Luo marveled. Earth resonance specialized in defense. Lian Zhong had been contesting offense up till now, setting aside his natural strengths. Switching to defense made him an even tougher opponent.Lian Zhong was all serious business now. Their clash so far had made him understand THAT Li Luo was indeed a good match for him.He had even been forced to rely on his advantage of defense to sap Li Luo's stamina.\"Li Luo, you're indeed very strong. A Seventh Seal, but able to push an Eighth Seal like myself. Still, it's impossible for you to win.\" His dull, yellow power continued to feed into his armor.Li Luo rubbed his chin as he eyed the impregnable light armor with some irritation. \"Good man, you're such a coward! Can't win so you're going to turtle up? Weren't you full of swagger just a moment ago?\"Lian Zhong sniffed and ignored Li Luo's taunts. He said, \"Well, come beat me, then!\"Li Luo snorted. \"What a pervert...\"But I'll allow it.\"\"Pfft. All talk.\" Lian Zhong taunted.Li Luo smiled slightly. He put away his Flare Blade and wielded his Ripple Blade in a single hand. In the next instant, water resonance power surged up along the length of the blade.Slowly, the azure power formed a knife shape of its own.It was like a blade of fast-circulating water.\"High-grade resonance art, Water Edge?\"Lian Zhong recognized it immediately, and he relaxed. The Water Edge Art was one of the more offensive moves available for basic water resonance users. It used rapidly circulating water to bring about a searing effect.But ultimately, water resonance power was not suited to offense. It was practically impossible for Li Luo to break his armor like that.Li Luo bent over his water edge and smiled softly to himself. \"Perhaps an ordinary Water Edge Art might not work...\"But my Water Edge Art is not ordinary.\"As he spoke, a dazzling sparkle of light suddenly shined on the blue edge. Only Li Luo himself knew what was happening.He had imbued his light resonance power into it as well, creating thin channels through which his water resonance power was funneled.This meant that the water resonance power was now circulating at a terrifying pace.Such an unorthodox method would definitely produce a Water Edge Art that was... special.Li Luo dubbed it... Reinforced Water Edge Art, Version 1!Lian Zhong was eyeing the water edge apprehensively. Was the color becoming purer? What was going on? He felt a sense of foreboding.Li Luo did not keep him in suspense for too long. He leaped forth, the Ripple Blade in his hand still pulsing with jade light.\"COME AT ME!\" Lian Zhong roared. \"I'M NOT AFRAID!\"As he bellowed, the water edge in Li Luo's hand cut past his earthy, yellow armor.Li Luo landed behind Lian Zhong. He did not turn around, but calmly sheathed the Ripple Blade back at his waist.Behind him, Lian Zhong's face had frozen. The next instant, his armor shattered.His body keeled over, raising a cloud of dust as it landed.No one else had noticed this, but there was a crystal winking as it recorded the entire battle, displaying it on the crystal wall at Whitespirit Mountain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A clip of two people facing off in a forest.In a pavilion, a bored Cai Wei was carefully peeling a grape. She was just about to pop it into her dainty mouth when her eyes fell on the crystal wall.\"That person looks like the Young Lord.\" Cai Wei started.Yan Lingqing perked up as well, looking over at the two figures facing off.\"Indeed...\"Cai Wei sat up straight, the grape forgotten. \"Who is he fighting?\"Yan Lingqing did not know either, but she quickly gleaned the news from the whispers all around that were quickly growing louder. \"Second place in Eastpool Academy, Lian Zhong. Sixth-grade earth resonance, Eighth Seal.\"\"Why would Li Luo cross such a strong enemy?\"\"It's inevitable in the elimination match. Even if he avoids trouble, trouble will come looking for him.\" Cai Wei's perfect brows creased slightly. Under them, her beautiful eyes were fixed on the scene unblinkingly.Yan Lingqing gave it her full attention now as well. Both knew that it would be a tough fight.As they watched intently, Li Luo and Lian Zhong began their fight. Each thrilling clash drew small, anxious facial twitches from the two women.But as the battle drew on, their astonishment grew more and more apparent. They saw that Li Luo was not at all at a disadvantage.He was clearly only a Seventh Seal, but he had an Eighth Seal firmly in hand.Especially with his final Water Edge skill. When his Ripple Blade sliced through Lian Zhong's light armor, Cai Wei was so excited, she slapped the table.\"The Young Lord is awesome!\"Yan Lingqing was staring too, cherry lips parted slightly in surprise, a look of stunned disbelief all over her face.She did not think that Li Luo would be able to handle a strong Eighth Seal opponent so handily.It was a perfect fight, and he played it out flawlessly.As Li Luo calmly sheathed his sword, she was struck by the contrast to the diligent youth who quietly crafted spirit liquids and purifying lights at her workshop.He was now brilliance incarnate.Perhaps this was the real Li Luo. Using warmth and cheek to hide his light...\"Seeing this, I'm starting to believe that he can make it to the top 10,\" Yan Lingqing said in delight, a spark returning to her clear eyes.Outside the pavilion, there were also other exclamations. Clearly, they were not the only ones surprised by the outcome.In the main tent, the dean, Governor Shi, and Mentor Anlie were watching the same fight.The old dean was all smiles now, unable to hide the grin that was creeping across his face. \"The second-placed student at Eastpool Academy was defeated by Southwind's rank 15, Li Luo? Haha, interesting.\"\"Isn't it very interesting indeed, Governor Shi?\"Governor Shi was shaking slightly as he forced the corners of his mouth up. \"He lives up to the title of the Young Lord of House Luolan. Extremely unexpected.\"\"This is Young Lord Li Luo from House Luolan? The one with a marriage agreement with Jiang Qing'e?\" Mentor Anlie suddenly asked.The old dean nodded, beaming.\"Indeed, he has good looks... Keke, this Li Luo hasn't entered the Astral Sage College yet, but his name is already famous in our school,\" Mentor Anlie said with a strange laugh.\"Defeating an Eighth Seal doesn't mean his entry is guaranteed now, does it?\" Governor Shi said thinly.\"Well, I think you're in for a good show,\" the old dean said in an unwavering voice as he looked up.....Of course, Li Luo himself was oblivious to the sensation his battle was stirring. He was busy dragging a fainted Lian Zhong somewhere else.As he cautiously parted a bush, he could see that the fight ahead was intense. He was surprised to see that Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang had the battle well in hand, despite the numbers advantage from Eastpool.Zhao Kuo was faring well as a meat shield, his huge axe swishing through the air as he tanked much of the offense. Around him, Yu Lang zipped back and forth, swift as the wind. His hit and run tactics had three of their opponents down on the ropes.If things continued this way, it seemed like the hurting would begin in earnest soon enough.Smiling, Li Luo walked out.All the fighters froze\u2014not just Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang, but even the Eastpool students stared at him, fear in their eyes.Their fear only doubled when they saw him dragging an unconscious Lian Zhong with him.\"Damn, Li Luo, you're sick. You actually beat Lian Zhong?\" Yu Lang said, mouth agape.Li Luo nodded, smiling. He threw him to the ground before him, then turned to the three Eastpool students. \"Still gonna resist?\"The three of them had lost all will to fight. They turned, preparing to scatter.But Li Luo was ready. With a flick of his finger, Waterlight Bullet flew out and exploded, rewarding him with three identical, pained howls.Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang took the chance to redouble their attack.In short order, the three were also on the ground.\"Let's split their points,\" Li Luo said.\"Woah, this is a real big fish.\" Yu Lang's eyes were gleaming now. The four of them all had a generous amount of points, especially Lian Zhong, with a whopping 2,400.As tempting as the prize was, Yu Lang did not seem inclined to take Lian Zhong's points. Instead, he said, \"Li Luo, you keep Lian Zhong's points for yourself. Zhao Kuo and I will split theirs.\"The others added up to slightly over 1,000 points. Although it was not as juicy as Lian Zhong's stash, it was a considerable sum nevertheless.Li Luo was about to say something, when Zhao Kuo chimed in as well. \"Brother Luo, you beat Lian Zhong alone. We can't be ripping you off like that. Besides, you have the potential to make it into the top 10. No need to be dragged down by the likes of us.\"Li Luo relented under their insistence. Taking off his crystal medallion, he cleaned out Lian Zhong's points.With smiles that resembled shark grins, Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo did the same to the other three from Eastpool Academy.\"Our boss won't let you get away with it!\" they howled in desperation, tears of frustration streaming down their faces.With this, Li Luo's points reached 3,900, while Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo had passed the 2,000 mark.Although they could not see the leaderboard, Li Luo reckoned that he would be in the top 30 now, while Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo should be in the top 100.He grinned. Although the top 10 might still be a ways away, he was closing in.\"Our brothers over at Eastpool Academy are really generous.\"\"I wonder if any more generosity is headed our way.\"Towards the end of the elimination round, the survivors would be tough. Taking points from them would not be at all easy. Therefore, Lian Zhong delivering himself up on a silver plate was highly welcome.\"Let's go. We're probably not far from Whitespirit Ruins,\" Li Luo said. With him leading the way, the three left.At Whitespirit Ruins, this elimination round would reach a white-hot climax.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There had been a castle here once, but the ravages of time had brought it low.A whole field of broken rubble stretched as far as the eye could see.There were also huge trees and vines that obscured their view of the rubble.This was Whitespirit Ruins, and also the location of the final battle of the College Final Examinations.The three of them stared warily for a long while before closing in. At the edge of Whitespirit Ruins, they discovered a shining crystal wall.There were letters floating on it, detailing the final rules.The rules were simple. When there were ten people left in Whitespirit Ruins, the College Final Examinations would be declared over. Points would then determine their placings.Suddenly, their crystal medallions lit up, then a beam of light projected a translucent screen in front of them.\"It's the scoreboard.\" Yu Lang gasped.They could indeed see it here at Whitespirit Ruins.Li Luo examined it. First place was Lu Qing'er, with 9,500 points.\"Hooo. That's hot. How many did she finish off?\" Li Luo marveled.They had used all sorts of tactics, baiting and even the lucky encounter with Lian Zhong. Even so, he had only 4,000-odd points. Lu Qing'er had doubled his score. She must have been a war goddess, cutting down all in her path.To no one's surprise, Shi Huang was in second place, with 8,300 points.Those after him hovered around the 5,000 mark, while Li Luo spotted his own name in 17th place.As for Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo, they were in the thirties.\"Brother Luo, if the going gets tough, you should split. Our ranking is roughly our limit now. We can go down in a flash of glory\u2014that's probably the last bit of use we can be to you. I think Yu Lang's on the same page, eh?\" Zhao Kuo said as he scanned the board as well.Hearing this, Yu Lang was quiet for a few more seconds. \"I feel like I still can go.\"Zhao Kuo tsked him, shooting him an angry glare. \"Go where? You're done.\"Yu Lang nodded glumly. Alright, alright, he was done.Although Yu Lang was not above getting ahead by hook or by crook, on the whole he was of the same mind as Zhao Kuo on this one. The two of them were Seventh Seals, nowhere near the monster that Li Luo was. If they met an Eighth Seal, they were probably bound to lose. And as the number of tough competitors swelled at Whitespirit Ruins, they would quickly turn from helpers to burdens.Only ten would remain here at Whitespirit Ruins in the end. They could not possibly dream of reaching the final ten without being a huge source of stress and liability for Li Luo.Even if Li Luo did not mind, they could not accept such an outcome.Besides, there was not much point in them entering the top 10. As long as Lu Qing'er took first place, then there would be plenty of entrance placements for Southwind Academy, and they would benefit too.Li Luo smiled at their words. \"We'll see when the time comes.\"His only goal was to enter the top 10 and get an entrance placement. Lu Qing'er was already there to secure first place for Southwind Academy as a whole, so there was no need for him to steal the spotlight.\"Let's go. We'll find a place to hole up in Whitespirit Ruins.\"Li Luo waved them on, leading the way into the confusing terrain of Whitespirit Ruins.At the same time, at the opposite side of Whitespirit Ruins.Shi Huang stood before a crystal wall, scanning the scoreboard with a cool gaze. His eyes lingered on Lu Qing'er's name for a long while.\"Boss, Lian Zhong's name is not on the list. Something must have happened to him!\" an Eastpool student exclaimed.Shi Huang was puzzled by that. He carefully checked the list. Indeed, Lian Zhong's name was absent, although he did see Li Luo in 17th place.His eyes narrowed. He had sent Lian Zhong to take care of Li Luo. And now Lian Zhong was gone, while Li Luo was sitting pretty on the board?\"He must have been ousted by Li Luo,\" Shi Huang said coldly.\"Huh? Isn't Li Luo just a Seventh Seal? How's that possible?\" those around him asked doubtfully.\"He must have something up his sleeve. Besides, did you all really think Li Luo was useless?\" Shi Huang said with a cold smile that did not reach his eyes.\"This Young Lord must have been lying low all this time.\"\"Should we deal with him?\"Shi Huang dismissed it. \"The most important target now is Lu Qing'er. Although Li Luo is a bit of a dark horse, he still doesn't warrant a change in our plans.\"Ignore him for now,\" Shi Huang said, walking into Whitespirit Ruins. \"After Lu Qing'er is dealt with, he'll be as trivial as a clown on the bridge.\"Not long after entering Whitespirit Ruins, Shi Huang spotted a fresh symbol carved on one of the ruined walls. He grinned and followed the mark onto a ruined street.A few minutes later, he ended up in a dilapidated hut.In the gloom, four people awaited. They were Xiang Liang, Chi Su, Zong Fu, and Song Yunfeng, the four whom Shi Huang had an agreement with.\"Shi Huang, you're still trailing Lu Qing'er in points.\" Xiang Liang smirked as he walked in.Shi Huang gave a thin smile. \"A temporary lead. It does not matter.\"\"Speak, then. When do we move?\" Chi Su asked.\"The most important thing now is to confirm Lu Qing'er's position and complete the plan. Leave her no room to escape. If she does get away, she will not be so easily caught a second time. And she can also play for time or cut the survivors down to the last ten to force the exams to end,\" Zong Fu stated clinically.Shi Huang nodded, turning his eyes on Song Yunfeng. \"I'm afraid we will have to trouble Song Yunfeng for this one.\" He smiled.Xiang Liang and the others also turned to him. Uncomfortable under their stares, he could also feel a sense of hostility emanating from them.Xiang Liang and the other two were not from Southwind Academy, so it was normal for them to want to take down Lu Qing'er. But Song Yunfeng was also of Southwind, yet he was helping Shi Huang win against her. That was a little distasteful.Although for their interests, they were happy to have an inside agent like Song Yunfeng, but that did not curb their disdain for his character.\"I'm ready,\" Song Yunfeng said, trying to repress his uneasiness.\"Then we are much obliged. In this matter, your contribution is the greatest,\" Shi Huang said, his face the very picture of sincerity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those that made it here were veterans of numerous battles and had risen above the others. They were more or less the elites of their generation in the Tianshu Province.Their arrival here immediately shattered the gloomy silence of the ruins, heated battles breaking out all over.The frenzy was reflected on the scoreboards as well, now visible both in and outside Whitespirit Mountain.Occasionally, a name would disappear and be replaced by another, indicating an elimination.As the cutthroat battles continued, all eyes were on the rapidly changing board. The numbers dwindled and the stakes rose......In a broken building.Li Luo listened to the sounds of battle nearby and then looked at the scoreboard displayed by his crystal medallion. He sighed. \"It's too quick.\"In just over an hour, the 100-odd students had been cut down to just 60.In this time, he had not met anyone, and his score had not changed. As a result, his rank had fallen from 17 to 23.\"Brutal.\" Zhao Kuo agreed.As they spoke, a blur whizzed in. Yu Lang.\"It's chaos out there. Fights everywhere.\" Yu Lang had been scouting for information. His wind resonance was well suited for it.\"Found anything?\" Li Luo asked.Yu Lang nodded, suddenly sober. \"I stumbled upon Shi Huang. And he has Xiang Liang, Chi Su, and Zong Fu with him.\"Li Luo looked up sharply. \"They're in an alliance?\"\"I suspect they're teaming up against Lu Qing'er,\" Yu Lang said solemnly, licking his lips.In these examinations,no one but Lu Qing'er could trouble Shi Huang.Zhao Kuo's face turned grim as well. It seemed like their hopes of getting into the Astral Sage College didn't just lie on Li Luo's shoulders. Perhaps Lu Qing'er was the less certain condition.Only by winning could she secure their school enough additional placements for them to succeed.Li Luo was looking troubled as well. \"It seems likely. Shi Huang's cunningness runs deep. He must have planned for everything. If Lu Qing'er is truly their combined target, she is in danger.\"If such was Shi Huang's plan, then they had to ensure that she remained safe no matter what. If Lu Qing'er was eliminated, then the rest of Southwind Academy would fall like chaff before Shi Huang.Even Li Luo could not handle Shi Huang, Xiang Liang, Chi Su, and Zong Fu all at once.Li Luo was quiet for a while, then he let out a deep sigh. \"Which way did they go?\" he asked Yu Lang.Yu Lang quickly pointed. \"Are you going?\"\"You know how important Lu Qing'er is. I have to go take a look. If she's in trouble, we're in trouble.\" Li Luo sighed.Yu Lang and Zhao Kuo nodded.\"You two stay here. It's easier for me to get around alone.\"\"Alright, take care.\"They understood that they would be in over their heads in a battle at that level, so they didn't object.Li Luo nodded, then he turned around without a word. He left without a sound, his azure-blue resonant power cloaking him.......Somewhere in Whitespirit Ruins.Lu Qing'er was sitting on a ruined tower, her features fresh. Her white top was clinging to the curve of her chest and her slim waist.Her long, white pants hugged her firm rump but let loose her shapely and long legs free. It emphasized her figure extremely well.Her long hair hung at just about the level of that hour-glass waist.She was a stirring sight, especially contrasted against the dour and woeful ruins.She pulled out a little cloth bag from the folds of her clothing. There was some dried fruit inside, and she chewed slowly, replenishing the day's exertions.Suddenly, she jerked, seeing someone approach.She looked closely and saw that it was Difa Qing.They had run into each other at Whitespirit Ruins, and of course the latter had been overjoyed to see her. She had wanted to stick together, and Lu Qing'er had no objections. Since they were peers, she didn't mind helping her out.\"Qing'er, you're truly a champion for us girls. All those guys were crushed by you.\" Difa Qing gushed over her.Lu Qing'er smiled slightly. \"It's not over yet.\"Difa Qing nodded. \"In these exams, Eastpool Academy is indeed a strong contender. I'm worried about Shi Huang.\"\"He's very strong.\" Lu Qing'er concurred. Even she considered him a threat.\"Mm. That's why same-school students should stick together. That's why I left a mark just now\u2014Song Yunfeng told me about it. He said that if I came across you and felt you needed help, I should let him know with that mark. If he saw it, he would help,\" Difa Qing said in a sunny voice.Lu Qing'er choked on her dried fruit.She stared at Difa Qing frostily. \"You're saying you left Song Yunfeng a mark nearby?\"Difa Qing was scared at the sudden hostility. \"Y-yes? What's wrong?\" she stuttered. \"Song Yunfeng is the second best in Southwind Academy. If he helps you, there's no need to be afraid of Shi Huang.\"Lu Qing'er looked at Difa Qing for a few dozen seconds. She then stowed her cloth pouch, her face stony.\"I'm leaving. Don't follow me.\"\"Qing'er... You- what's wrong? Did I do something wrong?\" Difa Qing anxiously asked.Lu Qing'er ignored her. Leaning forward on the balls of her feet, she leapt lightly off the tower, landing on a pile of broken rocks and taking off swiftly.Although she did not know what Difa Qing's mark would bring, she did not want to reveal her location so easily. It made her feel unsafe.\"Hopefully, it's just overthinking,\"\u00a0Lu Qing'er thought to herself.Just as she was about to slip away, her lithe body suddenly seized up, and the rocks under her exploded with a brilliant green light, snagging her exposed ankle.The attack caught her off-guard.Even so, Lu Qing'er was not completely unprepared. She remained calm, sending a current of her ice resonant power towards her foot.The green light was frozen, and materialized as some sort of green vine.Clap, clap, clap!Sounds of clapping from ahead. Lu Qing'er looked up and saw a figure standing on top of a broken wall, smiling at her.Shi Huang.To her flanks and behind her, others appeared, cutting off her escape routes.\"Got you, Lu Qing'er.\" Xiang Liang's eyes were gleaming as he laughed.To her front, Shi Huang. On the flanks and back, Xiang Liang, Chi Su, and Zong Fu. All three were formidable opponents.Things looked dire.Not far away, a crystal winked, feeding the scene back to the crystal wall at Whitespirit Mountain.Back at the foot of Whitespirit Mountain, the audience exploded with excitement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

First on the leaderboard?\"\"She's being targeted? That's Shi Huang, and Xiang Liang, Chi Su, Zong Fu. Hoo. All the top few in points.\"\"Southwind Academy is in trouble now. Shi Huang came well prepared. He must have plotted this earlier. If they can knock Lu Qing'er out, then Eastpool Academy will probably overtake Southwind Academy by eliminating their leader.\"\"Cheeky lads, ganging up on such a beautiful, wee lass.\"\"Well, no such rule. Lu Qing'er was careless, is all.\"\"...\"The chatter swelled with excitement. No matter which side you were on, this battle promised to be the most spectacular one in these exams.In the pavilion, Yan Lingqing and Cai Wei were staring at the crystal wall, faces stiff.\"Lu Qing'er is in trouble,\" Cai Wei said.\"They're ganging up on Southwind Academy,\" Yan Lingqing said shrewdly.They had accurately pinpointed Lu Qing'er's location, then Shi Huang had come personally. He had even invited three others who were currently on the top 5 standings. They were giving Lu Qing'er no room to escape.\"Trouble.\"Cai Wei scowled. Li Luo was from Southwind Academy, so naturally she was on Lu Qing'er's side. Besides, Lu Qing'er had helped the Suncreek Villa out before, so of course Cai Wei did not want to see her eliminated.Still, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride.In the main pavilion, the atmosphere had become stifling. It seemed like the air itself had gone still.It was the old dean's turn for a black mood. His body pulsed with a robust resonant power, casting an aura of intimidation around him.Nearby, Governor Shi sat unfazed, a small smile playing across his lips.\"Governor Shi must have gone to great lengths to plan this, eh?\" the old dean asked curtly.This plot did not only involve Eastpool Academy, but even conspirators from three different schools. This was a plot long in the works, and no sudden get-together.Xiang Liang, Chi Su, and Zong Fu were mere students. The fact that they would choose to work together with Shi Huang meant that their respective schools had given them such direction. And the only one in the Tianshu Province capable of uniting multiple major schools against Southwind Academy was Governor Shi himself.\"Southwind Academy has held the title of best school for too long,\" Governor Shi said cheerfully. \"This is but the will of the masses.\"\"Governor Shi, your coming to the Tianshu Province can be likened to a rat dropping in a cauldron of soup,\" the dean said caustically.A hint of anger flashed in Governor Shi's eyes. He stated simply, \"My hand was forced by you, Dean.\"\"Don't worry. This year at the royal court evaluation, I will give you a poor review again. At that time, Governor Shi will probably give up the position,\" the dean said icily.Governor Shi responded with an equally cold smile. \"Oh, don't worry. If you lose the title of best school, then Southwind Academy's evaluation holds no weight.\"Electricity sizzled in their mutual glare, a wordless communication of anger and hate that only heightened the tension in the main pavilion.Mentor Anlie just sat there, ignoring their altercation. He had seen all too many of such politicking. As long as no rules were broken, he would not step in.He was completely focused on the crystal wall. Inwardly, he thought that the lass Lu Qing'er was in a pitiful position...Within the expanse of broken buildings.Lu Qing'er's cold gaze was fixed on Shi Huang, who was in front of her. \"You must have gone to great lengths to put this show together,\" she said, her voice ringing out clear and cool.\"A gesture of my great respect for you, Qing'er.\" Shi Huang smirked.She shook her head slightly, knowing that words were useless. Her petite frame surged with icy-white resonant power, and her ice-silk gloves began to freeze over with flakes. It was almost like a tiger's tongue; a light graze would tear into flesh.These custom ice-silk gloves were Lu Qing'er's weapons.The other three began to harness their resonant power as well. Each readied their weapons as they stared mercilessly at Lu Qing'er.The tension was palpable.In the next instant, the three moved as one, each from their respective direction. Three beams of light shot forth, caging Lu Qing'er.Lu Qing'er's own ice resonant power flared out to meet them. She did not back away, but instead took the fight to them.As her power howled around her, the air around them grew thicker, and patches of frost could be seen on the cracked ground beneath them.Bang!The four resonant powers clashed in spectacular fashion. But the ones who were dismayed were the three attackers. They could sense the power behind Lu Qing'er's ice resonant power, sweeping away their own attacks.\"It's really a Ninth Seal's power!\"\"A high-grade seventh-grade ice resonance!\"Then the three attacked again.\"Crimson Fire Palm!\" Xiang Liang shouted, pushing his fire resonant power to his palms. A flaming crimson palm print flew towards Lu Qing'er.\"Poison Ivy Hex!\"Clasping her hands together, Chi Su sent her venom-green power snaking out along the ground, forming green tendrils that whipped out at Lu Qing'er's feet.\"Water Whip!\"Zong Fu waved his long sleeves and sent a blue whip flying through the air. It was packed with moist power, aimed at Lu Qing'er's head.They had clearly coordinated this beforehand. Their well-choreographed attack targeted Lu Qing'er's vitals.\"Frost Halo!\"Lu Qing'er stomped her foot, and an icy-blue halo shimmered into existence around her body. It expanded smoothly, freezing all that it touched. The three attacks were nullified.They faltered.Lu Qing'er did not. She charged Xiang Liang, her dainty hands already moving, calling forth more icy wind as she moved, so they would have to fight in the bitter chill.Lu Qing'er's onslaught overwhelmed Xiang Liang in an instant. If not for Zong Fu and Chi Su coming to his rescue, he would have fallen all too quickly.The chaotic melee in the ruins was hard to keep track of.It was three on one, but everyone could see that Lu Qing'er held the upper hand.Such fighting ability left the spectators in awe. What beauty! What skills!Seeing the situation on the verge of souring, Xiang Liang finally roared to their mastermind, \"Shi Huang, what are you waiting for?!\"Bang!Just as he shouted, a shrill thunderclap echoed across the wreckage. A bolt of lightning streaked towards Lu Qing'er.Her eyes hardened at this new attack, but she was still unhurried. After all, she already knew that Shi Huang would join the fray eventually.Her ice resonant power gathered at her silk gloves, and they seemed to be shrouded in crystals.Her palm darted out to connect with the lightning spear.Sshhh!Ice and lightning clashed and scattered across the field.Lu Qing'er was shaken slightly, while the attacker was sent retreating.This might be the first time in the exams that Lu Qing'er had not had the upper hand in battle.Worry crept up on her youthful features as her eyes tracked the crackling figure. \"A high-grade seventh-grade lightning resonance. Formidable.\"\"Qing'er, your high-grade seventh-grade ice resonance is equally deserving of respect,\" Shi Huang replied jauntily.\"Still, you're not getting away today.\"Lu Qing'er remained quiet for a few beats. Shi Huang and her were evenly matched. With his three lackeys in the fight, she was indeed at a disadvantage.But if they thought that was all it would take to get Lu Qing'er to come quietly, they were naive.\"Since you want to play, I'll entertain you till the last,\" Lu Qing'er said coldly.They felt a chill run down their scalps at those words.All eyes on her. Lu Qing'er stretched out her hands and gently removed her ice-silk gloves.With that, her bare hands were now exposed.Their eyes narrowed. Shi Huang was suddenly looking serious too.\"Is she finally going to use that trump card...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They must have been shaped by a divine being.Her hands had an otherworldly beauty to them, as if they were carved straight out of mutton fat jade.When she revealed her hands, the three youths present were entranced by their beauty, even Chi Su, who was a girl.Beautiful faces, they had seen plenty. But seeing hands that held such beauty, this was a first for them.It was a pity that Lu Qing'er kept them hidden under silk gloves all the time.There were also icy patterns that could be seen faintly on Lu Qing'er's hands, which were exuding a cold mist.\"Be careful. That's Lu Qing'er's secret technique, Hands of Ice Jade... She might only be a Ninth Seal, but that technique could trump some Duke Stage resonance arts,\u201d Shi Huang warned them sharply.The others stiffened up upon hearing this. They looked at Lu Qing'er's beautiful hands with renewed caution.Duke Stage resonance arts were on a completely different level than Ten Seals Stage fighters. They themselves were unable to use such high level resonance arts, and yet Lu Qing'er's ace could be used even before entering the Resonant Master Stage. That was a scary prospect indeed.They were starting to understand why Shi Huang had called them together to deal with Lu Qing'er even though he was quite strong himself. This trump card must have been what he was afraid of.Lu Qing'er, the ice queen, wasted no words. Without any changes to her frosty expression, she moved toward Shi Huang's position.Deal with Shi Huang first, apparently.Shi Huang had anticipated that. With a flash of lightning, he retreated.The lightning resonance also specialized in speed, much like the wind resonance.Lu Qing'er immediately changed targets, giving up on their leader and turning to Xiang Liang.Xiang Liang panicked. He did not have Shi Huang's speed, and could only call forth his fiery resonant power with a shout.At the same time, his sword burst into flames. He charged Lu Qing'er.Hu!The blade sang through the air, but Lu Qing'er did not seem concerned. With a flick of two fingers from her left hand, a gust of icy wind blasted out against the attack.Dong!A clear ringing sound like a bell, and Xiang Liang found his blade encased in a thick ice coating that doused his fire resonance instantly. It expanded swiftly, and soon he was encased in ice on the spot.One move, and the Eighth Seal Xiang Liang was down!Lu Qing'er's Hands of Ice Jade was chillingly strong indeed.Chi Su and Zong Fu immediately ran for it.But having shown her trump card, how could Lu Qing'er just let them go so easily? She sent two well-aimed shots at their legs, creating ice shackles that rooted them.Another flick from two fingers, and two more ice sculptures were formed a few moments later.In the blink of an eye, these three top rankers on the leaderboard had been dealt with by Lu Qing'er.However, after dealing with the three of them, the faint icy patterns on her left hand started to dim.Clap, clap!From behind, applause. \"The brilliant Hands of Ice Jade.\" Shi Huang praised her gleefully.Lu Qing'er turned to him with a neutral expression.But this time, Shi Huang did not run.Lu Qing'er sent her right fist pressing forward, icy wind howling with it. It seemed like even the air itself was freezing. It slammed straight into Shi Huang's chest.Shockingly, he was not frozen.Across the surface of his skin, lightning crackled. An electric armor.\"Qing'er, if your Hands of Ice Jade was complete on both hands, you could break my Voltaic Plating. But with just one hand? Not yet, it seems.\" Shi Huang smirked. His own trump card, revealed.Against the full brunt of the Hands of Ice Jade, Shi Huang had to be cautious. But now that she only had half her strength left, he had nothing to fear.In other words, he had gathered the other three as meat shields against the Hands of Ice Jade. All had gone according to plan.They went at each other with full force, draining away their energy. Finally, Lu Qing'er's heart sank as the patterns on her right hand dimmed.Her Hands of Ice Jade were expended.Bang!Just then, Shi Huang struck with lightning speed. A savage fist boomed out, smashing into Lu Qing'er's abdomen.Her petite frame was sent flying, and she crashed heavily into a pile of jagged rocks. Blood appeared on her lips.\"Qing'er, what a shame. The final victor is... me,\" Shi Huang said, his smile almost apologetic. He walked over to the helpless Lu Qing'er.Seeing the situation, Lu Qing'er sighed inwardly as well. She looked at the approaching Shi Huang dejectedly. As unhappy as she was, there was nothing more she could do.\"I'll have your points.\"Shi Huang reached out a hand, pawing at the crystal medallion on Lu Qing'er's chest.Swish, swish!Just at that instant, dozens of lightballs whistled out of nowhere, exploding between Shi Huang and Lu Qing'er.A blinding light.Shi Huang was caught off guard, and his eyes were pierced with pain. Still, he quickly stretched out to snatch at Lu Qing'er.Nothing but air.Panicking now, he forced his throbbing eyes open, and he saw a figure clutching Lu Qing'er and vanishing into the ruins.Shi Huang flew into a rage and rushed forward. He leaped over a broken wall but saw no traces of anybody.All good humor was gone now, replaced by a towering mood.That person had escaped quickly, but still Shi Huang had recognized him.\"That damn Li Luo!\" Shi Huang hissed through gritted teeth. \"He's ruined it!\"1. Mutton fat jade is one of two types of jade, and is also known as nephrite. The other one is chicken bone jade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a demented look in his eyes. He was just on the verge of eliminating Lu Qing'er, his greatest obstacle, and now Li Luo had whisked her away!The feeling of his painstakingly constructed plan going to ruins was enough to make Shi Huang blow his top. How he wished he could tear Li Luo into a thousand pieces!Shi Huang's eyes swept the ground for traces of Li Luo's trail, but he saw nothing. The pair seemed to have vanished into thin air.He searched for a while, then deemed it fruitless. He took a deep breath, struggling for composure. He returned to the three ice sculptures and used his resonant power to thaw them.All three were blue in the face as they crawled out of the ice, shivering uncontrollably.It was quite a while later before they finally began to recover.Shi Huang looked at them. \"Lu Qing'er has been taken away by Li Luo. Our mission is not yet complete.\"\"We must move quickly to find them. I injured Lu Qing'er. She will need some time to recover, and her Hands of Ice Jade are temporarily spent. She will not be able to use them for a while. As long as we find her, eliminating her will be easy.\"The three nodded.They had gone to such lengths, so they did not want to come up empty-handed.\"Just the few of us alone will not be enough, I fear. The terrain is confusing too. I suggest we spread word of Lu Qing'er's grievous wounds. There are also other students in Whitespirit Ruins. In peak condition, they would not dare to cross her, but with her injured and holding so many points, there will be bolder ones who would attack,\" Zong Fu said suddenly.The others immediately approved of this, and even Shi Huang's eyes lit up.\"Let's go. Give them no time,\" Shi Huang ordered. Then they scurried away.......Outside Whitespirit Mountain.When Lu Qing'er was suddenly rescued, a huge cheer went up outside. After all, for those not invested, the winsome Lu Qing'er was a much more appealing side to back. Besides, she was the underdog.However, they also knew that Lu Qing'er had been injured. Even though she had been saved, they had only bought some time.\"It seems like it was the Young Lord who saved Lu Qing'er.\" Cai Wei had a sharp eye, and she seemed to have identified him.Yan Lingqing cocked her head. \"This Li Luo is an oldhand at rescuing damsels in distress. Timing, method, all perfect. What girl could resist?\"Cai Wei gave a half-smile. \"Could it be that Qing'e will have a new rival?\"\"That will be something to watch,\" Yan Lingqing said with relish.The lighthearted atmosphere here was a stark contrast to the mood back in the main pavilion, although the old dean had also lightened up a little with Lu Qing'er's rescue.Still, he had not spoken, because he too knew that Southwind Academy was in a dire situation.With Lu Qing'er heavily injured, it was too much to ask to take down Shi Huang.Beside him, Governor Shi sipped his tea serenely. He was not overly affected by Lu Qing'er's rescue. He also knew that this development had come just a little too late.She was no longer the biggest problem.As long as Shi Huang found her and took her points, all would be well.At that time, the coveted title of best school in the Tianshu Province would fall to Eastpool Academy.The thought brought a faint twitch of happiness to Governor Shi's lips.Oh, the rescuer was Li Luo? That House Luolan boy was indeed a vexing one. But no matter; as long as he remained in control of the Tianshu Province, there were all too many options for him to create trouble and instigate House Luolan's fall.......Somewhere in Whitespirit Ruins, Li Luo gently laid Lu Qing'er down in a natural tree hollow.He lowered his head to find Lu Qing'er's eyes locked dead on his face.\"Although I know the impact of my white knight rescue has devastated you, I hope you can control yourself,\" said a deadpan Li Luo.Lu Qing'er bit her lip, her willowy brow dipping in reaction to the sharp pain coming from within. She knew her injuries were not trivial.\"How bad is it?\" Li Luo asked.She sighed, discouraged. \"Quite bad. I'll be much weaker in fights from now on. I was too careless.\"\"That's bad. Shi Huang and his goons will be hunting us desperately. If he's smart, he'll call the other students. We'll be dug out sooner or later.\" Li Luo frowned.\"I'm sorry.\" Lu Qing'er hung her head.\"What are you sorry for?\" Li Luo asked, surprised.\"I wasn't able to get first place. I let everyone down. Southwind Academy will lose the additional entrance slots,\" Lu Qing'er said softly.\"How's that your business? Entrance slots are to be earned individually. Additional slots, your first place, all those are your individual accomplishments. If you can't take them, it's just bad luck for the other Southwind students,\" Li Luo said indignantly.\"The Lu Qing'er I know isn't this shy. Were you hit over the head or something?\"She stared at him huffily. \"You're the one hit on the head.\"Li Luo grinned. \"Oh, I almost forgot. You're injured, and I have a water resonance. I can help you heal!\"\"I'm afraid these injuries won't completely heal in so short a time.\" Lu Qing'er hesitated.\"Heal what you can,\" Li Luo said. His waterlight resonance was special, and both water and light resonances had rejuvenating properties. Combined, they should be able to work some healing miracles.He reached out to clasp her small, white hand with his own.He had just taken hold of her hand when Lu Qing'er jolted upright. She vehemently pulled her hand back, her usually fair complexion now blushing furiously. She stared at him embarrassedly. \"Hooligan, what are you doing!?\"Li Luo was startled by her reaction as well. \"Using my water resonance power to heal you.\"Lu Qing'er stammered. \"Well\u2014well don't hold my hand!\"Li Luo shook his head, dumbfounded. \"My resonant power is faint enough as it is. Through clothing, it will be even weaker. Or you could turn around and I could pull your clothing down a little?\"Lu Qing'er's pearly whites grated against each other, staring him down furiously like a little mother tiger.\"Fine! No healing! Too hard to coddle! Let's just wait here for elimination, then!\" Li Luo was irritated now. This girl was troublesome. Such a fuss over healing!Even he would get angry!\"Wait.\"Seeing him rise, Lu Qing'er hurriedly stopped him. She hung her head. \"I was wrong. Continue, please.\"Li Luo sniffed, then sat back down. He stretched out a rough hand to take Lu Qing'er's own. Perhaps because of her technique, her small hand was especially cool to the touch, almost like jade itself. It put some naughty thoughts in his head.But Li Luo kept his expression blank, quickly channeling his resonant power. Blue power flooded through his hand, entering Lu Qing'er's body and repairing damage.As his water resonance power flooded through her, she was surprised by its purity. Its regeneration was far more effective than she had anticipated.A slow warmth spread within her, and the pain faded.She glanced up at Li Luo holding her hand and then dipped her head so her long hair covered her face. Her face was red as a tomato, and her body was also quivering. It was a sight not often seen.Lu Qing'er was not actually unwilling to let Li Luo hold her hand. But because she cultivated the Hands of Ice Jade, it made her hands especially sensitive when she was not channeling power through them. That was the reason she wore the ice-silk gloves, not allowing others to touch her hands.Li Luo had grabbing her hand roughly and then later made her apologize\u2014the usually proud Lu Qing'er felt humbled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone knew that she was first on the leaderboard. If Lady Luck brought them to her, wouldn't they shoot up to first place instantly?Usually, they would be afraid of her strength. But now that she was injured, what was there to fear?And so the greedy students-turned-bounty-hunters started to comb the area for her energetically.......Shi Huang was perched on a tall, brick feature, emotionlessly monitoring the changes in Whitespirit Ruins. They had been searching for an hour now, but Li Luo and Lu Qing'er seemed to have vanished. No one could find them.\"I don't know what's going on. It's unsettling,\" Shi Huang said, cocking an eye at Xiang Liang and the others.Zong Fu said, \"There's no need to panic. With such a methodical search, they won't be able to hide much longer.\"Shi Huang let out a long sigh. He knew that getting nervous was not going to help. But he could not dispel the uneasiness that weighed on his mind.Suddenly, he heard a rustle. Turning, he saw Song Yunfeng walk out from the ruins nearby, someone in hand.\"I should be able to help you force Li Luo out,\" Song Yunfeng said with a small smile.He gestured to the trussed up figure with him. \"This person is called Zhao Kuo, a good friend of Li Luo in school. He and Yu Lang were following Li Luo before.\"Li Luo was able to track you down probably because of Yu Lang. What he didn't know was that while he was tracking you... I was tracking him.\"When you fought with Lu Qing'er, I went in and caught Zhao Kuo. But Yu Lang got away.\"Zhao Kuo was bound hand and foot, and even gagged for good measure. He could only stare furiously at Song Yunfeng.They had actually been aware of Song Yunfeng's presence, but they had dropped their guard against a schoolmate. After all, it did not make sense for them to compete against one another, which would be counterproductive.And yet Song Yunfeng had struck deviously.In that moment of crisis, Zhao Kuo had thrown himself at Song Yunfeng, buying Yu Lang time to get away, but sacrificing himself.Song Yunfeng ignored his furious gaze. \"Although we cannot kill during the exams, we can play with this guy. I'm sure that once Li Luo gets wind of it, he won't be able to resist coming to save his good friend.\"\"Haha, Yunfeng, you're a godsend!\" Shi Huang laughed loudly.He turned to Chi Su. \"Put this Zhao Kuo up in a prominent place. I want to see whether Li Luo will choose his brother or Lu Qing'er.\"Zong Fu frowned. \"Isn't that a bit excessive?\"Shi Huang dismissed it with a wave. \"It's all Li Luo's fault for poking his nose in. All of this started because of him,\" he said indifferently.Chi Su obliged. She lifted a hand, and green vines stretched out to bind Zhao Kuo.......In the tree hollow.Li Luo opened his eyes, looking at Lu Qing'er, still blushing red as a tomato and quivering. He found it peculiar. \"You alright?\"Her teeth were biting hard against her rosy lips as she shook her head. \"Is it done?\" she asked in a faint voice.Li Luo nodded and smiled, letting go of her hand. Her entire body relaxed, as though relieved of a heavy burden.The blush slowly receded while Lu Qing'er checked her wounds. She was astonished. \"My injuries are more than 80 percent recovered.\"It had been just about an hour, and Li Luo had worked a miracle.Were his healing powers so strong?\"Li Luo, you're amazing!\" Lu Qing'er squealed.Li Luo sketched a bashful gesture. \"Make use of what time we have\u2014recover some resonant power.\"Lu Qing'er dipped her head, shutting her beautiful eyes. She started to channel her own energy cultivation art to recover power.When Li Luo stood up and poked his head outside the tree hollow, his expression turned dark as he spotted something.Glancing back at the recovering Lu Qing'er, he used his water resonance power to cloak himself in the Water Shadow Art, then he slipped out of their hiding hole.Li Luo moved swiftly through the wrecked landscape. A few dozen minutes later, he paused in a well-hidden place, watching the scene ahead.High on a weathered tower, Zhao Kuo hung.Shi Huang and the others were around him, keenly watching their surroundings.\"Li Luo, I know you can see us. I'll cut the crap. Give us Lu Qing'er, and I'll free your friend,\" Shi Huang shouted loudly.Silence all around.\"If you don't come out, then your friend's pride will be ground to dust today.\" Shi Huang sneered. He picked up a stone, crushing it into pieces in his hand. With each flick of his fingers, he sent a piece smashing painfully into Zhao Kuo. The pain was intense enough to make him break out into a cold sweat.He had been ungagged, but still he gritted his teeth, not making a sound. He knew that they were doing this to lure Li Luo over.\"Tough, aren't you?\"Shi Huang said with a cool smile. Flick, flick, flick. Now the pieces were charged with lightning resonance, and they thudded into Zhao Kuo with dull shocking sounds.He writhed and thrashed like a fish on the hook.Shoosh!Just at this moment, a green streak breezed in. \"Shi Huang, you ball-less scum! When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna dip you in the latrine!\"Shi Huang cocked an unconcerned eye at him. \"That's Yu Lang,\" Song Yunfeng informed him.\"Zhao Kuo, I'm here to save you!\"Yu Lang shouted. He shot forth like a bullet towards the hanging Zhao Kuo.Song Yunfeng snorted. He sent a casual backhand into Yu Lang, who did not defend himself, taking the blow.Blood spurted forth from Yu Lang's lips, but he still moved like a leaf cutting through the wind, drawing ever closer to Zhao Kuo.Shi Huang frowned. He attacked.But suddenly, a burst of green light spewed from Yu Lang's mouth. It landed squarely on Zhao Kuo's chest, smashing his crystal medallion.Yu Lang suddenly froze. Song Yunfeng was stalking him like a hungry tiger. Calmly, he plucked the crystal medallion from his own chest and then crushed it.\"Haha, I've got no medallion now. I'm out. Come fight me, then.\"Yu Lang hooted with glee as he danced a little jig, taunting them.Shi Huang, Song Yunfeng, and the others all paused. They had assumed Yu Lang was here to save Zhao Kuo. But in truth, he had never intended to do so. He was here on a suicide mission to eliminate them both.They could not do anything to eliminated students. That was against the rules.As the reality of the situation dawned on them, their faces were as sour as if they had swallowed lemons.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still dangling in the air, Zhao Kuo was chortling as well, swinging with the wind.\"Yu Lang, you rascal. You're smarter than you look. It's like you have a brain!\"\"You praise me too much,\" Yu Lang said, scratching his head in a bashful gesture.Shi Huang looked at the two. They were of no more use to him now. And all they could do was throw angry words at him. There was no need to bother with them anymore.Song Yunfeng was the more frustrated one. He had come up with this plan, and Yu Lang had ruined it completely.\"Yu Lang, you two had the chance to make it to the top 10. Why choose to be eliminated here? You think it's worth it?\" Song Yunfeng needled him.Yu Lang drawled lazily back at him, \"A blockhead like you wouldn't understand, Song Yunfeng. Yu Lang here might like money, but even I have standards. At the very least, I wouldn't do something like backstab my own school to help out other schools.\"\"Your words mean nothing. I will go on to the Astral Sage College. And you two, your careers end here,\" Song Yunfeng replied coldly.Yu Lang smirked at him. \"Really? Even Li Luo fought you to a draw last time. Who's to say what's possible or not?\"A dark shadow crossed Song Yunfeng's eyes. This Yu Lang really had a poisonous mouth.Shi Huang cut him off with a gesture. \"Enough. This plan has failed. We will continue to search for them inch by inch. They cannot hide for long.\"Song Yunfeng nodded, turning away from Yu Lang.Unbeknownst to them, Li Luo was watching this all with a calm expression.His expression was calm, not a single ripple of emotion showing. And yet those familiar with Li Luo would know that this was extremely unusual for this usually warm and amiable man. Something was wrong.A calm expression was intense anger for Li Luo.His gaze lingered on Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng for a few seconds, then he turned, moving swiftly and surely away.As he left, Shi Huang seemed to sense something, as if an enemy had been watching him. He turned vaguely in that direction.Could it be Li Luo? Best if it was. Surely that exchange must have angered him.Then again, what could a weakling's anger do?Inside the tree hollow.When Li Luo returned, Lu Qing'er was still recovering. He did not disturb her, instead sitting down and cultivating with his eyes closed.Another hour passed.When the sun began to set, russet rays cast long shadows on Whitespirit Mountain. Vision fell, but Li Luo could hear more voices coming their way. The searchers.Li Luo opened his eyes to Lu Qing'er's lovely eyes staring at him. The latter quickly averted hers.\"How's the recovery?\" Li Luo asked.\"Not bad,\" Lu Qing'er said with a pretty smile.Li Luo was silent for a few beats. \"Right now, can you still beat Shi Huang?\"Lu Qing'er hesitated. She shook her head. \"I can't. Shi Huang is not weaker than me. If my Hands of Ice Jade were in peak condition, I might be able to. But now that it's expended, it will not recover in a short time. Plus, my injuries are not completely healed.\"Besides, Shi Huang's Voltaic Plating Armor is quite daunting. Without the Hands of Ice Jade, I can't break it.\"Li Luo's face fell when he heard that. Didn't that mean Shi Huang would get first place sooner or later?Lu Qing'er sensed something off about Li Luo's mood. She asked cautiously, \"Li Luo, what's wrong?\"\"I will have Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng eliminated before the top 10 are decided,\" Li Luo said ruthlessly.\"They captured Zhao Kuo and humiliated him, trying to force me out. But in the end, Yu Lang snuck in to eliminate Zhao Kuo himself, then smashed his own crystal medallion.Examination suicide,\" Li Luo said tonelessly.Lu Qing'er's beautiful features were lit with anger now. \"That's too much!\"Now she knew why Li Luo was thrown off. His usual, sunny demeanor was gone. He was truly angry now.\"I'll help you. Shi Huang is hard to deal with, but if we fight to the bitter end, he might not win!\" Lu Qing'er suddenly said after a long silence.Li Luo looked at her. He saw a vengeful resolution in Lu Qing'er's eyes that surprised him. Could she have something else up her sleeve?But it seemed like such an ace, if it existed, would come at a heavy price. Otherwise, she would not have held it back when she was already at the brink of elimination.\"Not necessary.\"Li Luo was moved, but he shook his head, smiling. \"I'll deal with Shi Huang. You take care of Xiang Liang, Chi Su, and Zong Fu.\"Lu Qing'er stared at him, aghast. \"You? Deal with Shi Huang?\"Although she did not want to crush his spirit, the truth was that Li Luo was only a Seventh Seal, while Shi Huang was a Ninth Seal with a seventh-grade lightning resonance!That was far stronger than Song Yunfeng and the others.Li Luo gave a reluctant smile. \"Well, I didn't intend to steal your spotlight this time around, but who asked them to push me like that?\"Don't blame me for it. My hand was forced.\"\"Oh, who cares about the spotlight. But you... Don't put on a brave front, okay? I already said I can help you beat Shi Huang,\" Lu Qing'er said with a stomp of her foot.She was afraid that Li Luo would recklessly go solo and end up in Shi Huang's hands.\"Have some confidence...\" Li Luo smiled.\"You're a Seventh Seal! Light years apart from Shi Huang!\" Lu Qing'er cried.\"That at least is true.\"Li Luo agreed. \"So I intend to reach the Eighth Seal!\"Lu Qing'er was speechless. \"What?\"Three...\"Two...\"One\u2026\"Done.\" Li Luo breathed out.Lu Qing'er was confused as all hell. She was just about to speak, when her eyes went wide as she stared at Li Luo in shock.She could sense the resonant power within him stirring... His resonant power had increased?He was really an Eighth Seal?!!She was absolutely flabbergasted. Was this some sort of prank?! Was Li Luo really this amazing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her pouty, little mouth was now hanging open, a marked contrast to her usually cool demeanor. It was a cute side of her that was rarely seen.Li Luo was tickled by her expression too. \"Haha, I'm kidding. I prepared a lot before these exams, and was already on the verge of a breakthrough. Thanks to the stimulation from Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng, I cultivated a little and managed to break through.\"Lu Qing'er seemed convinced, but she shot him a dirty look nonetheless. For a moment, he had her believing that he could really break through at will. One, two, three, silly me.\"But your cultivation speed is quite frightening. I feel like it's above average for a seventh-grade,\" Lu Qing'er continued suspiciously.Li Luo nodded. \"I used spirit liquids and purifying lights to increase my quality.\"Lu Qing'er accepted this with a slight nod and did not pursue the topic further. She returned to the main question. \"But even if you're an Eighth Seal now, you've only closed the distance to Shi Huang halfway. Your chances of winning are still slim.\"Shi Huang was a Ninth Seal, and with a high seventh-grade lightning resonance. It was, by nature, an offensive and speedy element that was hard to deal with, and ferocious in battle.In comparison, Li Luo was a fresh Eighth Seal, and a passable sixth-grade-or-so water resonance... The gap felt drastic.\"Let's just go with this first,\" Li Luo said.Seeing his determination, Lu Qing'er complied. If she could finish off her opponents speedily, she could go and help Li Luo.While the two were talking, a head suddenly popped into the tree hollow. He was agog with surprise at seeing the two, then yelled out happily, \"HERE!\"Ping!He had just shouted when a blast of ice resonant power landed on his face, freezing it solid.He had been culled before he could even yelp.Still, his call had attracted the attention of those nearby, and many were flocking over now.But as they neared, they saw Li Luo and Lu Qing'er walk out.\"Lu Qing'er's fine? Were we had by Shi Huang?\" Seeing a recovered Lu Qing'er and a frozen unfortunate beside her changed their minds quickly enough.Lu Qing'er had already put her ice-silk gloves back on, and she glared at the vultures. \"Get lost. Our goal is Shi Huang.\"Her icy voice was backed by icy power at the ready. The gravel beneath her feet was already icing over.The other students turned pale and quickly ran away, inwardly cursing Shi Huang for being a sneaky liar. Lu Qing'er wasn't hurt badly at all!After chasing the others away, the pair remained where they were. They knew that Shi Huang and the others would arrive soon enough.Indeed, they were not kept waiting long. A few minutes later, a few people could be seen rushing over from the west, leaping agilely over the terrain.Shi Huang, Song Yunfeng, and company.They paused in front of Li Luo and Lu Qing'er, staring with alarm at her vastly improved condition.\"Qing'er, your injuries are healed?\" Shi Huang asked, his face full of concern.She ignored his oily concern, instead turning to Song Yunfeng. \"Song Yunfeng, you're an ingratiate.\"She had been ambushed by Shi Huang and the others previously precisely because Difa Qing had left markings as Song Yunfeng had instructed her. He was the one who had enabled this.Song Yunfeng quailed a little under her ice-cold stare. \"Qing'er, I have my own troubles!\" he stuttered shamefully.Her stare continued to bore into him, her chill working deeper into his psyche.Cracking under her fury, Song Yunfeng snapped back with his deepest feelings, \"You pretentious girl! I've wooed you for so long, and you didn't even respond! Let's see how high and mighty you'll be after you get eliminated!\"His anger was directed at both of them. Li Luo must have played a part in Lu Qing'er's quick recovery.He did not know what they had been up to during this time. Besides, Li Luo was the white knight who had rescued Lu Qing'er. Recalling her attitude towards him, the fires of jealousy were lit in Song Yunfeng's heart now.\"Li Luo, you must have been born in the year of the dog, since you like to poke your nose everywhere,\" Song Yunfeng lashed out.Li Luo cocked an eye at him. \"Says the filthy traitor who sabotaged Zhao Kuo and Yu Lang.\"Song Yunfeng sneered. \"Even if I hadn't done it, they would have been eliminated sooner or later.\"Li Luo smiled. A very unsettling smile that had doubt seeping into Song Yunfeng's bones.Shi Huang's eyes were darting back and forth between Lu Qing'er and Li Luo. \"Hey, Li Luo, this matter has nothing to do with you,\" he pointed out with a smile. \"I'll let you leave, how about that? Then you'll still have a chance of making it to the top 10, hmm?\"Li Luo turned his smile on him. \"But now I am very angry. I don't want you to enter the top 10.\"Shi Huang choked on his laughter, pointing at his head. \"Has your anger made you lose your mind? Seems like your brain is affected by the turn of events.\"Yes, Qing'er might be better, but you're naive to think that she can beat me.\"Li Luo shook his head. \"I have no intention of letting her defeat you. I was planning to do it myself,\" he said with full conviction.Shi Huang did not even bother to laugh at that one. Beside him, Song Yunfeng and the others also stared at Li Luo as if he were an alien, lost for words at the sheer ridiculousness of his declaration.Had Li Luo lost his mind?While they were still speechless, Lu Qing'er turned to Li Luo. \"So I'll deal with Xiang Liang, Chi Su, and Zong Fu? What about Song Yunfeng? Shall I deal with him as well?\"Li Luo scratched his chin. \"Before the main course, I think I need an appetizer. Song Yunfeng will do just fine.\"\"Understood.\"Nodding prettily, Lu Qing'er turned to her targets.They were all flustered now. Lu Qing'er was actually intending to let Li Luo take Shi Huang down?\"What should we do?\" Xiang Liang and the others turned apprehensively to Shi Huang.Shi Huang's eyes narrowed. \"Lu Qing'er's Hands of Ice Jade cannot be used. Go keep her occupied. I'll be there to help you once I deal with this,\" he said flatly.The three hesitated, then they finally nodded. They cautiously turned to face Lu Qing'er.And as they spread out, now it was Li Luo alone, facing Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng.All of this was fed back to the foot of Whitespirit Mountain, raising a loud clamor. This was even more outrageous than the ambush on Lu Qing'er.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That's Young Lord Li Luo of House Luolan, right? He's going to fight Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng alone?!\"\"Unbelievable! That Li Luo's not even in the top 10 candidates, right? What's making him so plucky?\"\"No idea, can't read him.\"\"But that boy looks so handsome. Maybe he has some real talent.\"\"Ehhh, all that glitters is not gold.\"\"You must be blind. That isn't gold, it's a brilliant diamond.\"\"....\"Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing sighed softly to themselves. \"What is that young man up to now?\"It was quite a headache. Previously, Li Luo was a low-profile kind of guy. If others didn't bother him, he would prudently get on with his life. But now he had sprung up to challenge Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng. The gap was quite astounding.\"Can he really beat Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng?\" Cai Wei asked doubtfully. She had always had confidence in Li Luo, but it was the enter-top-10 kind of confidence, whereas he was in deep now.Yan Lingqing had no answer to that. She pinched an elegant brow. \"I wouldn't know.\"The storm cloud hanging over the two ladies was as though their own little brother was in a rebellious phase.In the main tent.The glum dean was watching too. Surprisingly, he did not feel surprised. Instead, a thrill ran through him.This Li Luo...Perhaps because he knew Li Luo's parents too well, looking at Li Luo step up put a lightness in his heart.Logically, there was no way that Li Luo should be able to take on Shi Huang. But instinctively, a glimmer of hope seemed to present itself.\"The bravery of this Young Lord is quite commendable.\" Governor Shi laughed.\"Pity that he... isn't Jiang Qing'e.\" He shook his head.The old dean turned a deaf ear to him. No point in getting into a fight now. Let the kids fight, and all would be clear.He was busy staring at Li Luo's thin profile. He suddenly recalled the excitement he felt back when Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan had dropped Li Luo off at Southwind Academy.Back then, Southwind Academy already had Jiang Qing'e. With the addition of Li Luo, Southwind Academy's reputation within the Xia Kingdom would only bloom.But that excitement had died down quickly after Li Luo's blank palaces came to light. It was a bitter pill of disappointment for him to swallow.But now...\"Li Taixuan, Tan Tailan, is your son a late-blooming miracle?\"...With all eyes on him, Li Luo turned to face Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng. \"How shall we play,\" he beamed.\"You're bluffing! I can deal with you alone!\" Song Yunfeng jeered.He had just started forward when he found Shi Huang's hand on his chest. Shi Huang smiled slightly. \"Why go alone? Whether he's truly confident or faking, why even offer him a chance? We'll go together. Faster that way.\"Song Yunfeng hesitated. \"Looks like we're thinking too highly of him.\"\"I'm not afraid of thinking highly of him. I'm afraid that our plan goes awry,\" Shi Huang said coolly.Seeing him so cautious, Song Yunfeng gave in with a resigned nod. The two brought their resonant powers to bear and shot it towards Li Luo.\"Nggh...\"Seeing their simultaneous attack, Li Luo was flustered as well. \"Hey! Where's the cliche fight-the-lackey-first, boss later?\"\"You're full of crap,\" Song Yunfeng scoffed, redoubling the intensity of his attack.Li Luo had been on the verge of pulling out his shortswords to meet the enemy, but faced with one more than he had bargained for, he froze, instead turning tail and running away.Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng naturally gave chase with all their strength, blasts of resonant power still flying out in pursuit.Li Luo dodged adroitly.\"Li Luo, weren't you all cocky just now? You're just a chicken!\" Song Yunfeng mocked.Li Luo ignored him, concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other as fast as he could. With a final burst of speed, he sprinted into an area with a build-up of broken walls.Song Yunfeng and Shi Huang had their hands full just chasing him.Swish, swish!As they rounded the corner, lightballs greeted them. Strong explosions pierced their eyes with light, disorienting them.But both were prepared. Shutting their eyes, they thrust their weapons in front of them, calling forth powerful gusts of power that swept away the buildings.By the time they opened their eyes, Li Luo had vanished.Shi Huang's face was black. He leaped up on a big boulder, scanning the horizon. He could see a faint shadow fleeing in the distance. Towards... where Lu Qing'er was fighting Xiang Liang and the others.\"Luring the tiger away from the cave? Sneaky devil!\"Shi Huang's eyes went flat. Li Luo was trying to pull them away from Lu Qing'er's fight and then turn back to help.Help Lu Qing'er secure a swift victory, then face them together?\"He's going to help Lu Qing'er. I'll go stop him!\"Shi Huang shouted to Song Yunfeng. In a flash of lightning, he was gone, a silver streak charging after the fleeing shadow.He opened his lightning resonant power to the maximum, and soon caught up to the faint shadow. Fashioning his electric power into a spear of lightning, he pinned the shadow to the wall.It did not even make a sound. Instead, his spear flew on through it and embedded itself against a stone wall.Shi Huang's face whitened. There was only a faint echo of power that held the shape of the shadow. But Li Luo was not here.\"Shit, it's a trap! This is the real bait! His target is Song Yunfeng!\"Shi Huang was furious. He had been played hard by Li Luo!Li Luo had no intention of going to help Lu Qing'er. He wanted to separate the two and then take down Song Yunfeng.But... How could that punk think he could take down Song Yunfeng so quickly?Dismissing the thought, Shi Huang turned back as fast as he could.Meanwhile, Song Yunfeng was also speeding across the tricky terrain, trying to catch up to Shi Huang.But as he leaped over a broken brick wall, a bolt of blue resonant power came arcing his way.The sudden attack left Song Yunfeng scrambling. And then he understood.His expression was disdainful.\"You think I'm as soft as a rotten persimmon?\"Li Luo, I'm going to let you know how lucky you were in the last\u2014\"While shouting, Song Yunfeng shook his silver spear, calling forth the depths of his power unreservedly. He sent forth his spear against the blue sword slash.Dang!The clash of metal.When their resonant powers clashed, the resulting shock was enough to crumble the nearby walls, raising a dust cloud that slowly drifted down.Song Yunfeng's expression only grew uglier as he threw forth his strongest attack with reckless abandon.Peng!Song Yunfeng was sent flying, crashing painfully into rubble.\"\u2014draw?\"His voice cracked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The latter was a miserable wreck on the floor. Li Luo's single slash had creamed him.Flecks of blood could be seen on Song Yunfeng's lips. \"You, you're an Eighth Seal?\" He looked up at Li Luo in disbelief. \"Impossible!\" In that clash, Li Luo's resonant power had been a match for his own.Moreover, he was deeply shaken by how pure Li Luo's water resonance power was. And the robust, mature feel to it\u2014it felt like a seventh-grade water resonance!Wasn't his water resonance a fifth-grade?Song Yunfeng wondered if he was dreaming.Li Luo let out a soft sigh. \"Well, that's a tale that starts 16 years ago. I had just been weaned, and on that day...\"Song Yunfeng was listening closely.He did not hear Li Luo lean forward, waterlight gathering under his feet as he zipped over to Song Yunfeng and slashed at him brutally again.Song Yunfeng hurriedly parried, but the force of the slash forced him to a single knee. \"You tricked me?!\" he yelled.\"Very clever, you have seen through me.\"Li Luo encouraged him. Another kick flashed out whip-like into Song Yunfeng's chest, sending him flying face-first into mud.Before he could stand up, Li Luo was on him again, his sword twinkling and roaring with the power of a tidal wave.Song Yunfeng was overrun. An Eighth Seal Li Luo with equivalent matching power and tricks up his sleeve\u2014it was keeping him so busy that he had no time to think.Tricks unbecoming of the young lord of House Luolan!Li Luo had soon carved Song Yunfeng up like a turkey. He was a woeful, bleeding sight.He knew that things could not go on like that. With a primal scream, his own resonant power burst forth, charging Li Luo recklessly with a scarlet spear.Li Luo lifted a palm up, and waterlight seemed to shimmer before him. \"Giga Reflection Art!\"Hearing this shout, Song Yunfeng recalled how Li Luo's sneaky Water Mirror Art had reflected his power on him, even though he was only a Sixth Seal then. Now that he was much stronger, wouldn't the Water Mirror Art's reflective ability be even stronger?Song Yunfeng pulled up short at the last moment, checking his strength.To his horror, no water mirror formed before Li Luo. Instead, all he saw was a handsome face grinning smugly at him.\"Gotcha.\"Li Luo chuckled. He darted forth with the Ripple Blade, its Water Edge spinning so fast that it was humming.One chop from Li Luo neatly severed Song Yunfeng's spear in two.Dong!The ring of steel, then Song Yunfeng was staring at his broken spear, stricken.The blade came down on him again.\"Ah!\"He screamed, fresh blood spurting from his chest.Li Luo heard a rustle in the wind behind him and saw a black-faced Shi Huang charging over.\"LI LUO, HOW DARE YOU!\" Shi Huang yelled, loud enough to make his eardrums throb.Li Luo ignored him, sending the pathetic Song Yunfeng flying with a kick. His other leg casually hooked up the broken spear and sent it flying.Weng!The broken spear pierced Song Yunfeng's shoulder, pinning him to the wall.Shi Huang had arrived. Furious, he sent a spear lancing towards Li Luo, jerking from its electrical charge.Li Luo moved backwards easily, landing on a wall. \"Hey,\" he said cheerfully, \"rushing back for dinner?\"Shi Huang's eyes flicked over to Song Yunfeng, dangling from the wall. He frowned. The latter was heavily injured, his fighting ability temporarily nullified by Li Luo.He looked back, the anger in his eyes fading away. \"Li Luo, everyone underestimated you.\"You are the one in Southwind Academy whose waters run deepest.\"Li Luo smiled. \"You're too kind.\"Shi Huang's expression was neutral. \"No need to get a swollen head over it. The game is in motion now. You'll change nothing.\"\"Well, I won't know if I don't try,\" Li Luo said with a small smile. \"I have just one thought right now...\"His gaze swung back and forth between Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng. \"As Yu Lang said... to dip you two in the latrines.\"Shi Huang shook his head. Useless words. He lifted his spear, pointing it at Li Luo. \"Enough with the bluster. You're only making a bigger fool out of yourself.\"Show me what you got, Li Luo. Otherwise... I will wipe the floor with House Luolan's reputation.\"With those final words, his lightning resonance crackled into life, his Ninth Seal resonant power brought fully to bear.Bang!Shi Huang shot forth with a low rumble, his speed bewildering the eye. Truly a terrifying lightning resonance.Weng!In a few breaths, he was already in front of Li Luo, his lightning spear seeming to slice the fabric of reality itself as he thrust it.It crackled ominously.Li Luo responded with his strongest offensive skill, the Water Edge Art. He charged his blue resonant power to its maximum.His twin blades sliced out, leaving faint traces of blue light in their wake.Ding!Blade and spear clashed, generating an impact that scattered the gravel.In this straight clash, Shi Huang did not budge an inch, whereas Li Luo was sent skidding backwards. A clear advantage for Shi Huang.\"Eighth Seal resonant power...\"But such purity. I couldn't destroy your body with my lightning resonance.\"Despite his advantage, Shi Huang looked slightly troubled. There was a bizarre purity to Li Luo's resonant power. He possessed a seventh-grade lightning resonance, which was already fairly dominating. Cultivators with such high-grade resonances could gradually grind away at their opponent with each clash, corroding their opponent's resonant powers. It was an advantage of these higher-quality resonant powers.Although he had beaten Li Luo back, his lightning resonance had been unable to penetrate his body and diminish his fighting power.Li Luo whirled his twin blades experimentally. He now had a feel for how strong his opponent was. No wonder even Lu Qing'er was wary of him.Ninth Seal, seventh-grade lightning resonance.A worthy opponent indeed.Li Luo suddenly grinned. He was not at all worried about how strong his opponent was. Instead, he found himself bubbling with excitement.All these years, his blank palaces had bred in him an aversion to showing his true self. He always liked to play his cards close to his chest, it gave him a sense of safety.Low-profile, as much as he could.Although he had been growing while keeping his head down all these years, a fierce battle will coursed deep down in his bones.After all, he was the son of two Dukes.Very well, then. After so many years, it was time to take center stage. Let the spotlight shine!With a small laugh to himself, he channeled the resonant power within him. Gripping his blades tightly, he shot towards Shi Huang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ding!Within a broken-down hamlet, two figures charged with resonant power clashed in a blur of sword and spear, leaving cracks on the walls nearby.The loose gravel beneath their feet was churned up, clattering against the walls almost as if in a rhythm.Li Luo was fully focused, his blades whirling and cutting without pause as he sent wave after wave at Shi Huang.In contrast, Shi Huang looked much less concerned. Even against Li Luo's constant attacks, he chose to overwhelm them with brute force. His spear swept out time and again, charged with lightning resonant power, beating back the swords.It was an intense clash of weapons and resonant power.And yet Shi Huang could see that he had the upper hand. His spear found gaps in Li Luo's offense, threatening him menacingly.Each time, Li Luo's sword would shoot out little orbs of light that dazzled him, forcing Shi Huang back.Although he had the upper hand, Shi Huang's resentment lingered. It was still not a situation he had planned to find himself in.Taking advantage of a gap, the lightning power on Shi Huang's spear leaped into a new frenzy and his eyes gleamed.\"High-grade resonance art, Thunder Bird's Call!\"Electricity welled from the tip of his spear, and a shrill bird call sounded. It was as loud as thunder, and it rendered Li Luo's ears temporarily deaf.His world silent, Li Luo saw the accumulation of lightning coalesce into an angry thunder bird that swooped forward.Li Luo's waves of sword light were blasted away by it.But just as the spear was about to reach him, a mirror of water shimmered into existence.\"Waterlight Demon Mirror!\"Weng!The thunder bird crashed into the water mirror, rippling the surface. A powerful energy surfaced in response, crashing into the thunder bird.Boom!The shockwave of resonant power left many more cracks in the walls of the hamlet.Both Li Luo and Shi Huang were sent flying backwards, their feet leaving deep gouges on the ground.Shi Huang stared keenly at Li Luo. \"Is that the damned Water Mirror Art you used to fight Song Yunfeng to a draw?\"He was clearly well informed about Li Luo.\"You can call it... the Great Stalemate Art!\" Li Luo joked.Shi Huang ignored his nonsense. Waving his spear, he called forth his lightning resonance and sent another Thunder Bird's Call forth.Li Luo lifted a hand, summoning the Waterlight Demon Mirror again. Again, both were forced back.The intense battle continued. Despite his advantage, Shi Huang could find no way to break through Li Luo's Waterlight Demon Mirror. The battle reached a stalemate.The spectators outside Whitespirit Mountain were shocked by this unexpected turn of events.The Young Lord of House Luolan's reputation had been lackluster for these past few years. Who would have thought he would rise so spectacularly during the College Final Examinations?Then again, the apple would not fall far from the tree.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing were gaping in shock as well. Before they knew it, Li Luo was an Eighth Seal. Just a month ago, he still had blank palaces. Although they knew he had caught up a little in that time, such a ferocious rate of cultivation was mind-boggling.It seemed like he had been preparing for this chance for a long time.With a completely astounded audience watching from outside, the battle between Li Luo and Shi Huang continued for many more minutes.Each time, Shi Huang came with the same attack and was met by the Waterlight Demon Mirror's responding counter.But the last time, Shi Huang's body was covered with a faint, sparkling light, as though forming an electric armor around him. The counter attack was immediately absorbed by the lightning armor, which grew stronger.Li Luo's eyes widened, and he hurriedly retreated.But Shi Huang was quicker. His spear swept out, an arc of lightning catching Li Luo's body.Peng!A dull thump accompanied the electric shock, and Li Luo was sent flying. His shortswords dug into the ground, skittering backwards for a long time before he finally found footing.A smear of blood could be seen on his mouth, and he could feel an intense, piercing pain in his chest. All from a single attack of Shi Huang's spear.Luckily, he was a waterlight resonance user with powerful regeneration powers. With a quick activation of his powers, his wound began to heal speedily.Li Luo looked up. Shi Huang was looking at him neutrally, spear in hand. The electric armor he was sheathed in had absorbed the counter attack from his own Waterlight Demon Mirror.\"Voltaic Plating, eh...\"Li Luo frowned. Lu Qing'er had warned him about this\u2014Shi Huang's killer move. Voltaic Plating not only greatly enhanced Shi Huang's defenses, but also augmented his offense and speed. It was quite a useful move.While Li Luo was still reeling, Shi Huang did not intend to give him any space to breathe. With a quick twist of his body, he was on the move again.This attack was even more ferocious than the last.Li Luo did not take it head on. A flick of his finger sent forth a Waterlight Bullet that impeded Shi Huang's attack.But he was ready. Shutting his eyes, the electric-charged spear thrust in Li Luo's direction.Pools of waterlight shimmering beneath his feet, Li Luo swiftly slid away, out of the attacking area of effect.Shi Huang's attack did not cease. As inexorable as a storm, he came pressing forth.More walls cracked in their wake as Li Luo desperately retreated and Shi Huang grimly chased, a leaping bolt of lightning in pursuit of flowing, glowing water.All of Li Luo's moves were rendered useless now.Shi Huang with Voltaic Plating had completely outclassed Li Luo.Sighs of regret came from the spectators. At this point, the disparity was all too clear. Ultimately, Li Luo just could not beat the Ninth Seal Shi Huang.It seemed like Southwind Academy's best school title was in danger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Boom!Within the wreckage, faint sounds of thunder boomed out. Some distance away, the other schools' students were watching Shi Huang throw his full strength time and again, constantly forcing Li Luo back.If this continued, Li Luo would be eliminated before too long.They shook their heads. Although Li Luo's growth had been ferocious, he was just that bit of oomph short of taking on someone as strong as Shi Huang. A pity.Ding!Another brutal clang of sword and spear, and Li Luo was again sent flying, crashing straight into a broken building.Shi Huang's spear was upright as he stared into the wreckage, cutting a striking figure as electricity leaped and danced across his skin.\"Li Luo, trying to play a stamina game? I don't think you're quite there yet,\" he said, a hint of contempt in his voice.\"If you want to keep some pride, hurry up and surrender.\"Inside the building, the light was dim. Li Luo was leaning against a wall, and he laughed to himself when he heard Shi Huang's voice. \"Tough indeed,\" he mumbled. \"Seems like I was a little naive. I thought I could keep this in reserve, but it seems like I need some firepower after all.\"With an arrested expression, he grasped his two swords and hit them together, hilts first. Both hilts were engraved with snarling beasts, and now their fangs connected. With a light twist, they clicked into place.At the same time, the curves of his blades began to deepen.It looked... like a big bow made from his swords.A silver-blue bow.Li Luo pressed a finger at a spot on the blade, and a small hole appeared, silver string springing out. Li Luo twirled it out gently to string his bow.This was the special resonant artifact he had custom-made. Usually in the mode of twin swords, others did not know that it had another form, a big bow that Li Luo had dubbed the Dewlight Bow.He curled his hand tightly around the hilt-grip. He did not want to reveal his hidden ace just yet, but clearly if he kept his head down any longer, it would be chopped off.He looked up at the figure of Shi Huang outside, lips curled in a cold, cold smile.Outside, Shi Huang seemed to have sensed that something was wrong. Frowning, he transformed his spear into a silver bolt that flew into the building.Boom!He was rewarded with a boom of resonant power. Someone leaped out, landing gently on a vine-covered rock.Li Luo.Shi Huang clenched his fist, and his spear was called back. He was slightly worried, especially about the silver-blue bow in his opponent's hands.Both inside and outside Whitespirit Mountain, there was puzzlement. What was he intending to do?\"What damned trick are you up to this time?\" Shi Huang asked indifferently.Li Luo did not reply, instead choosing to take a deep breath and drawing his bow. His resonant power formed a faint arrow of light on the strings.Both arrowhead and shaft were glowing, formed by his light resonance. Only Li Luo himself knew that the light resonance structure was full of holes and gaps, which he then filled in with water resonance power, creating a synergy between them.It was as if water was being carried forth by light, at an indescribable speed.If water could reach such speeds, who would dare to call water resonance soft and weak?Li Luo could feel the resonant power fading from his body, but there was a smile on his face. This resonance art was based on a high-grade water resonance art called Riverflow Art and another high-grade light resonance art called Flowing Light Art...After numerous failures, Li Luo managed to express his dual resonant nature and successfully crafted this art.This arrow, he called it...The Dewlight Skystream Arrow.This was Li Luo's strongest attack now, and his final trump card.Shi Huang had been very composed this whole time, sure that there was nothing Li Luo could do. But When the arrow of light appeared on Li Luo's silver-blue bow, his face changed.He could feel a strange prickling sensation, as though he was facing an incredibly strong opponent.\"Impossible! He's just an Eighth Seal. How can he pose a threat?\"\u00a0Shi Huang's eyes were wide. He had the Voltaic Plating. He did not even fearLu Qing'er at full strength; what was a mere Li Luo?What was that arrow of light?Could it be a Duke Stage resonance art? But an Eighth Seal could not possibly activate such a resonance art!But if it wasn't a Duke Stage resonance art, how much damage could it do?Shi Huang started to back off. Facing Li Luo's unknown attack, he did not charge recklessly, but instead chose to retreat.He believed that this was Li Luo's final attack. As long as he could evade it, Li Luo would be at his mercy.Li Luo looked calmly at the quickly retreating Shi Huang. Lightning was fast, but could it be faster than light itself?His bow now pulled to a full crescent, Li Luo released his hooked fingers.Twang!A light humming rang out.A bolt of light shot forth at a speed that confounded the eye.Boom!His hairs standing on end, Shi Huang shouted, \"Lightning Steps!\"Electricity crackled to life at his feet, and he reached his maximum speed.Useless.He could only watch as the light shaft sped into his vision, and a wall between them suddenly opened up with a hole. Evening sun filtered through it.Sensing the danger he was in, Shi Huang called forth his resonant power and hurled his spear forth in the form of an electric dragon.Ting!A crystal-clear sound. Eyes wide, Shi Huang watched as his lightning-charged spear shattered.The light arrow continued on its path, punching through Shi Huang's extended left palm and leaving a clean hole.His Voltaic Plating did not manage to hold up for even a breath before it was penetrated.\"Ahhh!\"A scream of pain.Shi Huang's left shoulder was gushing with blood, and he fell to the ground, heavily wounded. Slumping against a broken wall, blood bubbled out from his mouth.And all around Whitespirit Mountain, silence fell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They closed their eyes, then opened them again. The screen was still the same\u2014Shi Huang had been shot down.\"What's happening?\" Cai Wei asked a little blankly.An instant ago, she was worrying about Li Luo's elimination, and now Shi Huang was the one squawking on the ground.It was too much for Cai Wei's ample chest to take.Yan Lingqing bit her lip. \"I think Li Luo has beaten Shi Huang.\"Cai Wei slowly leaned back on her chair, a small smile spreading across her lovely features. \"From now on, who will dare to call the Young Lord a mere mascot?\"Although only for a month, Cai Wei had been looking after Li Luo, and she was quite fond of him. She treated him like her own brother.And as the overseer of House Luolan's affairs in the Tianshu Province, Cai Wei knew very well how much Li Luo had struggled with his cultivation.Besides his endless capacity for spirit liquids and purifying lights, Cai Wei found the Young Lord very likeable despite his shenanigans.She was filled with joy and relief at his miraculous win.From now on, those within House Luolan would not disdain him anymore.Yan Lingqing nodded. Li Luo's performance today was sensational. He must have been hiding it before.\"The Young Lord is so different from his parents,\" Yan Lingqing remarked.Those two had dominated their entire generation in the Xia Kingdom. They were stellar, whereas Li Luo was much more restrained. Those that did not know better might even think that Jiang Qing'e was more like their child, and perhaps Li Luo was adopted...\"The issue with the blank palaces affected the Young Lord greatly. Even after he solved it, he opted to stay out of the spotlight. He keeps his secrets up his sleeve, it makes him feel safe. He grows quietly, with less frivolity,\" Cai Wei observed.\"I think that if not for Song Yunfeng and Shi Huang forcing his hand, the Young Lord would probably have settled for a peaceful top 10,\" Yan Lingqing said wryly. It was entirely possible, given Li Luo's personality. His goal was to enter the Astral Sage College. First or not, he didn't care.\"I don't think it's a bad thing though,\" Cai Wei said with a gentle smile.Yan Lingqing rolled her eyes at her. \"You're too soft on him.\"\"But he's so handsome.\" Cai Wei smiled....\"Hahaha!\"As the two women were enjoying a quiet moment of happy relief, the old dean in the main pavilion was laughing uproariously. He shook the entire tent with his laughter, until even those outside were looking over.\"Oh my, truly the son of Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree!\"His face was flushed with energy, all traces of fatigue and worry gone. He slapped the table hard. \"See that?\" he demanded of Governor Shi. \"The power of my Southwind Academy?\"Governor Shi seemed preoccupied with his tea, although the eyes reflected on the surface of the cup were furious.A completely unexpected turn of events.Li Luo had been on the verge of losing. And then a miraculous arrow.All these years of planning, shot down by one arrow. Governor Shi tried his best to suppress his rage. And failed. \"Can you be QUIET!\u201d\"QUIET, you old plank!\"The dean's temper matched his. \"You shriveled-up onion, you think you've the right to decide when I talk?\" Governor Shi's face was terrible to behold. His terrifying resonant power began to radiate from his body, a large, green python rearing and hissing.A lower seventh-grade green python resonance!\"Oh, you want to fight? Come on, then, I've had enough too!\" the old dean said with a humorless laugh. His own crimson resonant power flared up, a flaming beast with its hooves in magma.Lower seventh-grade, the Fire Eating Ape.These two Heavenly Dipper General experts readied themselves. Even though the room was made of stone, it began to crack under the mighty surges of energy.Mentor Anlie shouted out to them urgently, \"Gentlemen! We're in the middle of the examinations. If you cause a fuss here, the Astral Sage College might just reduce the number of entrance slots to the whole Tianshu Province next year!\"These words brought the bickering pair up short. The dean sniffed, retracting his resonant power.With a dark face, Governor Shi did likewise.Mentor Anlie shook his head, turning back to the screen. Shi Huang's left arm had been skewered by the arrow, left heavily wounded. He would be severely compromised in battle.It was more or less wrapped up.Albeit wrapped up in a way that no one had predicted.\"Word has always been that the Young Lord of House Luolan was useless. It seems that they were false whispers.\"...In the ruins.Shi Huang was still moaning on the ground, blood spurting from his arm. He could sense many pairs of eyes watching, intimidated now by his downfall.They were dismayed by this outcome too.Not far away was Song Yunfeng, still dangling from the spear pinned to the wall. He was stammering to himself, \u201cImpossible. Impossible\u2026\u201dHe could not believe that Li Luo had beaten Shi Huang!This was completely illogical. Shi Huang was a Ninth Seal with an upper seventh-grade lightning resonance! He was a beast in battle, and Lu Qing'er was the only one in the Tianshu Province who could pose a threat to him.But now Li Luo had shot him down.Song Yunfeng felt bitterness rise within. If not for Shi Huang's status, he would have screamed abuse at him and accused him of rigging the fight.He had not experienced it for himself, so he could not fathom why a simple arrow had undone Shi Huang so easily.Still, his understanding did not affect reality one way or another.Li Luo was standing on the vine-covered stone, looking at the bleeding Shi Huang with a neutral expression. He did not move, seemingly luxuriating in Shi Huang's predicament.He even sprawled in a sitting position, one hand on the bow, the other hanging loose.He looked like a demon king, and the other students watching from the shadows were petrified. They did not dare to make a sound, for fear of attracting Li Luo's attention.They all held their breath.After a few minutes, someone flew in. It was Lu Qing'er speeding over. She was holding a rope in one hand, towing three people who were tied up. Xiang Liang, Zong Fu, Chi Su.Evidently, she had beaten them.The first thing she saw was Song Yunfeng nailed to the wall.Surprised, she continued on past the ruined hamlet, then her footsteps slowed.Before her, there was a pool of blood, within which Shi Huang lay. He looked barely conscious, pale as a ghost.Lu Qing'er was truly astonished.Behind her, her three captives were even more shocked.She looked up to Li Luo, his face composed. She shuddered at the power he commanded.She approached him now, feeling as though they were back in their first year, when Li Luo was a giant.\"Are you alright?\" she asked softly.Li Luo looked down at her and then the tension whooshed out of his body, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from him.\"You're finally here...\"Quick, help me get down. I've run out of resonant power, I'm afraid of jumping down. What if I hurt myself?\"Lu Qing'er stared at him.It was both exasperating and hilarious. He had posed up there for so long, only because he had run out of resonant power?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His arrow had taken up all of his strength. Given how many people were watching him, if he jumped down helplessly, they would pounce on his weakness. He was worth too many points to pass up on.And so Li Luo had casually sprawled on top, his air of casual confidence holding them back.Lu Qing'er leaped up beside him with a waft of perfume. She stretched out a small hand to him.\"Gloves on?\" Li Luo checked. Yes, they were. Otherwise, they might both be screwed.Lu Qing'er shot him a look. She cut an impressive figure herself, a heroine straight out of a tale. She took hold of Li Luo's hand, then leaped down from the stone pillar.With both feet firmly on the ground again, Li Luo felt much better. He looked over at the three captives. \"Slaughter these three too?\"They looked at him with trepidation, even more so than when they regarded Lu Qing'er.After all, it was a nightmarish scene that lay before them.It was Zong Fu who sighed and said, \"I said before that you, Li Luo, might well be the greatest unknown factor in these examinations. Guess I was right.\"Xiang Liang and Chi Su were silent. They had scoffed at Zong Fu's prediction, and never once had they taken Li Luo seriously as a threat. But now they could see that Zong Fu's prudence was well-founded. If they had planned more carefully and saw his strength properly, they might not be in as bad a state as they currently were.Li Luo waved it off. He went to drag Song Yunfeng down from the wall, throwing him beside Shi Huang.At the same time, he charitably helped Shi Huang stop the bleeding, so he would not die from blood loss. That would be a troublesome ending.Shi Huang opened his eyes weakly. \"Li Luo, you hid it well,\" he said resentfully.Li Luo grinned and then feigned a tortured expression. \"Ah, why must you force me so? I just wanted to be in the top 10. Why did you all force me to go this far?\"Behind him, Zong Fu and the others swallowed. This was a little too much.Indeed, Shi Huang was so worked up that he was quaking. He retched another mouthful of blood.\"Hey, don't be so anxious, you're going to vomit blood.\"Li Luo hurriedly calmed him down, then used his crystal medallion to check the scoreboard. He saw that there were only thirteen people left\u2014no, twelve now. There were twelve.\"Phew, all's good. I almost missed it.\" He smiled with relief.\"Know what I'm going to do next?\" Li Luo said, beaming at Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng. There was something chilling about his smile.\"I said that I would ensure you two were eliminated from the top 10.\"Shi Huang's face was pale now, and his fear showed. \"Li Luo, you're cruel!\"Being eliminated from the top 10 would mean a loss of entrance slots. He might not even be able to go to the Astral Sage College. That would be absolutely devastating to Shi Huang.Beside him, Song Yunfeng was yelling as well. \"Li Luo, you can't do this! You'll incur the wrath of the entire Song family and the Governor's house!\"\"Childish.\"Li Luo shook his head and said peaceably, \"When you do something wrong, you have to pay the price. It's time for you to pay.\"He took down their crystal medallions, clearing out Shi Huang's points immediately. He erased Song Yunfeng's points as well, although students from the same school could not obtain each other's points.Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng's scores were reduced to zero.Li Luo clapped loudly. \"A big hand for Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng, for their achievement of eleventh and twelfth place!\"Their faces were ugly to behold.Xiang Liang and the others were quaking in their boots. This Li Luo was a real terror.Lu Qing'er was looking at Li Luo quietly. For some reason, she felt a tinge of fondness grow in her at seeing him like this.Li Luo had been too unobtrusive for the past few years, an unremarkable, harmless thing. But Lu Qing'er liked to see him in the spotlight, like how he was back when they first entered Southwind Academy. He had scolded her unreservedly while teaching her resonance arts.\"The exams should enter the countdown to the end now,\" she said happily.Li Luo turned to the other three with a frown. \"You three got off easy.\"Since he could only eliminate two from the top 10, he had chosen Shi Huang and Song Yunfeng, who were higher up on the hate list.Which meant that these three were in the top 10. Even if their points were cleared out, they would simply be at the bottom of the top 10.Hearing this, the three broke into ingratiating smiles. \"Brother Luo, we were forced. The higher-ups in our schools directed us to do what we did. We took so many resources from our schools\u2014we had to obey.\"\"But don't worry, once we get into the Astral Sage College, you'll be our leader. Your wish, our command!\"Li Luo ignored them, turning to Lu Qing'er. \"Clear their points. It irritates me.\"Lu Qing'er smiled slightly. \"No.\"Li Luo started, unsure of how to react.From the side, Zong Fu helpfully reminded him, \"Brother Luo, she means that if she takes our points, she will overtake you and steal first place in the exams.\"Xiang Liang and Chi Su's eyes widened, looking between the two. Lu Qing'er had defeated them, so naturally their points belonged to her. She could take first place, fair and square, but she had purposely chosen to place behind Li Luo. What was going on between these two?What was their relationship?Even Zong Fu looked at Li Luo in admiration. He was so cool. He was already engaged to a godly beauty like Jiang Qing'e, and he could still play around?Hearing Zong Fu's reminder, Li Luo belatedly realized that by clearing out Shi Huang's points, he was in first place. He panicked now. \"Qing'er, quickly now. I have a bit of a firstplaceophobia, you know?\"\"You'll get used to it.\" A wide smile filled Lu Qing'er's face.\"Lu Qing'er!\" Li Luo cried. \"Don't do this!! How did I wrong you, why must you hurt me so?\"Quick, please, I don't want to be first. I'm begging you. PLEEEEEEASE!\"Lu Qing'er sat down on the gravel. The setting sun bathed her in rosy golds and reds, and she propped her chin on her slim hands, smiling happily at the fuming Li Luo, still wringing his hands.And then a gong echoed across Whitespirit Mountain.Within Whitespirit Ruins, the survivors heaved sighs of relief, filled with a wild joy.But not Li Luo, who was looking glum at the ending gong.Unfortunately, he was in first place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0073\u2013 The Exam FinishesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen the final bell rang, there was a congratulatory mood among the audience as they processed the results.Clearly written, first place.Li Luo, Southwind Academy.This win was beyond everyone's expectations. Back when the exam had first started, no one thought that it wouldn't be the hot favorite, Lu Qing'er, or perhaps the only threat she faced, Shi Huang. Definitely not the under-the-radar, no-results-to-speak-of Li Luo!The young lord of House Luolan was no stranger to the people of the Tianshu Province\u2014after all, House Luolan had begun at the City of Southwind before expanding to the Xia Kingdom. They were once the pride and joy of the Tianshu Province, their bragging fodder to outsiders.And as the son of those two, Li Luo could not help but receive attention. But when his blank palaces came to light, everyone sighed inwardly. Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan had burned so brightly all their lives, but their son had inherited none of their talent.\"Like a tiger giving birth to a puppy.\" Li Luo had heard such remarks all too many over the years.Some had even said that perhaps Jiang Qing'e was the true child of Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan, and that Li Luo must have been adopted or something.The nasty remarks went on and on.And with today's result, their impression of the young lord was renewed. Although this youth might not have the sharp, invincible air of Jiang Qing'e, he was warm and enigmatic. It seemed like you would only know what cards he had to play when crunch time came.A different look from his parents, and even Jiang Qing'e.Outside, the Southwind Academy teacher Xu Shanyue looked up at the board, frozen in a thrall. Finally, he broke out of it. \"You see that? Li Luo's first!!\"Beside him, Lin Feng's expression was complicated. He did not know if he should be happy or sad.Although Southwind Academy had maintained their best school title, the glory had not gone to his First School. It was with the Second School, whom he had poured scorn on.Although Li Luo had shown some promise during the last few weeks, Lin Feng had dismissed it. His read was that no amount of catching up from Li Luo would bring him to Lu Qing'er or Song Yunfeng's level. After all, he had lost so much time.But now the winner of the entire exam was Li Luo.He turned to look at Xu Shanyue, features twisted in wild triumph. He felt a strong squeeze of regret grip his chest.He regretted not letting Li Luo back into the First School when he had shown signs of a comeback.And now that Li Luo was champion, Lin Feng would be regarded strangely from now on. After all, Southwind Academy had never had a champion that wasn't from the First School before.He, Lin Feng, would be spurned, while Xu Shanyue would be glorified forever.So although Southwind Academy had managed to defend its title as best school, Lin Feng felt a sudden urge to wail.Xu Shanyue had just gotten his emotions under control when he suddenly noticed the expression on Lin Feng's face, bitter as though he had been forced to eat out of the toilet. He shook his head in sympathy, at the same time feeling gratitude.\"Teacher Lin Feng, you're a real brother. I won't argue with you next time!\"Lin Feng gave a smile as though he had been eating lemons whole. His voice wheezed out of him faintly.\"Eh, hehe... wer, we're all brudders... same house... too kind...\"...Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing stared at the first place name for a long time and then exploded with joy.\"What a surprise!\" Cai Wei rejoiced.\"Fufu, Li Luo sure plays it quiet. If word of this gets to Qing'e, she'll be completely astounded.\" Yan Lingqing nodded approvingly.\"If the Young Lord can get into the Astral Sage College, his prestige in House Luolan will rise as well. Perhaps he will take some of the burden away from Qing'e,\" Cai Wei mused.Yan Lingqing nodded. Although House Luolan was plagued by problems both internal and external, there would always be those loyal to the king, namely Li Luo. After all, he was the blood kin of the two House Lords, and his right to rule was the most substantiated, even more so than Jiang Qing'e.However, his blank palace conundrum had cast a dim pallor on his future. Some had given up on him, but if he continued to perform well, he would be able to unite them again. At that time, he should be able to firmly take the House Lord seat, with Jiang Qing'e's support.At that time, House Luolan would finally return to stability.Both women were very much looking forward to that day....In the main tent, Governor Shi was completely silent when the result was declared, but the thunderous aura radiating from him scared everyone off.The old dean didn't care. He was on his feet, clapping as hard as he could.\"Well done, my lad. Truly the son of Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan. Everyone looked down on you, even this old myopic geezer!\" he roared.Governor Shi gave a short bark of laughter. Without a word of farewell to the dean or Anlie, he rose and left.Mentor Anlie shrugged and turned to the dean. \"Congratulations, Dean Wei Sha. Southwind Academy has clinched the best school title again.\"On the scoreboard, Li Luo and Lu Qing'er were in first and second place. This was Southwind Academy's best result in recent years, and the full 21 entrance slots would be swept up by Southwind Academy.One could only imagine how many families would go through fire and brimstone to send their children to Southwind in the near future. Even if those children could not win slots themselves, the sheer power of the school's reputation might see them into the Astral Sage College.Dean Wei Sha could not stop grinning.While all this was going on, the students within the arena were starting to exit as well. The cheers were especially loud when Li Luo and Lu Qing'er appeared.This was a real bother for Li Luo, who had been thrust into the spotlight. His handsome looks were already troublesome enough, and now adding strength into the mix?That was way more pressure than a young man could handle!\"Brother Luo, you were so cool!\" Zhao Kuo yelled ecstatically. He might have been eliminated from the top 10, but given Li Luo and Lu Qing'er's result, there was a slot in the Astral Sage College with his name on it, considering his rank in Southwind Academy.The other Southwind Academy students were all smiles too, looking at Li Luo respectfully. Those additional entrance slots had been won for them, almost all of them, thanks to him.There was a Chinese saying that went: when one ascends to Heaven, even his chickens and dogs rise with him.Li Luo shared a big smile with Zhao Kuo, clapping him on the back. He turned to search for Yu Lang in the crowd.He found him fervently clasping the hand of a particularly cute junior, his face serious. \"Do you know why Li Luo could beat Shi Huang? It was all thanks to my painstaking efforts to unsettle Shi Huang. That's why Li Luo won. Half the credit is mine, but being such a great brother, I don't begrudge him the glory. I'm not that kind of guy.\"The naive little girl stared at him with adoration.\"Rascal.\"Li Luo was speechless at the guy. His brain ran on a different wavelength from others.Lu Qing'er, who had been talking to a bunch of junior girls, turned to him with a faint smile. \"They say that today is a great day, and there will be celebrations tonight. They ask if you're attending.\"Li Luo sighed. These gatherings didn't mean much one way or another. Everyone would come fawn over him, and the girl fan club would try to make moves on him. Today, they would be more ferocious.Therefore, he nodded in assent in the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a beautiful location, and also the tallest restaurant in the City of Southwind. This gathering was wholly sponsored by the rich lady, Lu Qing'er.She had booked the entire Tower Qingfeng and invited many young men and women to join in the celebration.Li Luo was sitting with Lu Qing'er, and they had indulged in a couple of drinks. Her rosy blush was especially clear on her snowy skin. Under the warm lights, she captured the hearts of all present.One student came to offer a toast. \"Brother Luo is truly awesome. You and Sister Qing were the perfect duo, getting first and second. You'll be a legend in Southwind Academy.\"Li Luo glared at the guy. It was the sort of stuff you could only say here at the City of Southwind. If it were Xia City, it would be a completely different story!Beside him, Lu Qing'er twinkled a smile, touching glasses with the student.\"Damn Song Yunfeng, that traitorous vulture. He's from Southwind Academy, but he helped other schools attack Sister Qing! Scumbag!\" Some drunken students were beginning to get rowdy.These curses drew calls of support from the others. After all, this was a classic betrayal, which was hard to stomach.Difa Qing came looking for Lu Qing'er with her cup, guilt written on her face. \"Qing'er, I'm really sorry about what happened. If I hadn't left the marks, you would not have been ambushed.\"Lu Qing'er shook her head with a small smile and touched cups with her. It was a consolatory gesture, but Li Luo acutely sensed some stiffness in her gaze. Evidently, there was now a black mark next to Difa Qing's name in Lu Qing'er's book. Perhaps in her heart, she had already labeled Difa Qing as someone not worth associating with.After all, whether on purpose or accidental, such a blunder was not one that Lu Qing'er approved of.Making friends with fools would cause one trouble again and again, and they would bring out the pitiful, innocent face afterwards.\"Li Luo, I was biased against you before. I hope you don't hold it against me. I didn't have foresight. Your performance today marks you well worthy of Sister Jiang,\" she said to Li Luo in a small voice.Li Luo waved it off with a smile, but he did not comment further.Perhaps sensing the coldness from Lu Qing'er, Difa Qing took the hint and left.Li Luo looked at Lu Qing'er, seeing a hard look on her face after Difa Qing's apology. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, puzzled.\"Nothing much. Just thinking that fools make me angry,\" Lu Qing'er said emotionlessly.Li Luo was quite confused by this answer, but it was best not to guess the minds of young girls. He changed the topic. \"Although Song Yunfeng got eliminated outside of the top 10, doesn't it mean he gets a slot too?\"In the preliminaries, Song Yunfeng had ranked second. If placements were given out according to that, Song Yunfeng was guaranteed a place.\"Logically, yes.\"Lu Qing'er thought about it. \"But our dean is known to be a stingy man with a stingy heart. Song Yunfeng tried to take money from both sides. He almost cost Southwind Academy the best school title. I don't think he'll let Song Yunfeng have his way.\"Li Luo nodded. That made him feel better.It would leave a bitter taste in his mouth if he had slogged his butt off just to help Song Yunfeng enter the Astral Sage College.Now the old dean's pettiness looked like an especially endearing trait.While Li Luo and Lu Qing'er were heartily celebrating, there was a table higher up in the Tower Qingfeng, where some people were looking down at them with a amused looks.Among them was a girl in a yellow shirt. Her features were lovely, although her perfectly arched brows were on the thin side, giving her a mean look.She listened emotionlessly to the curses about Song Yunfeng drifting up from below, some anger flashing across her eyes.Her name was Song Qiuyu, and she was Song Yunfeng's sister. She a student in the Astral Sage College. She had just arrived in the City of Southwind today and was already greeted by some unwelcome news.\"To think the champion in the Tianshu Province's exams would be that trash Young Lord.\" Two young men were sitting on either side of Song Qiuyu, and the one who had spoken was a short-haired man in green, toying with his wine cup.\"Jingming, he's trash no longer. If he can become the champion, he must be quite competent,\" Song Qiuyu said.The one she called Jingming was Difa Jingming, Difa Qing's elder brother.\"Still, the Tianshu Province as a whole is weak. I hear that other stronger provinces had Tenth Seal fighters during their final exams,\" the other young man pointed out casually.\"Mo Ling, we know your Beiqiu Province has an abundance of talent. It ranks well in the top 10 provinces, doesn't it? The Tianshu Province is only average, so stop comparing us,\" Song Qiuyu said peevishly.Mo Ling was from a house in the Beiqiu Province that was blooming with talent as well. Plus, the Beiqiu Province was far larger and had far more talent compared to the Tianshu Province, so it was understandable that he looked at them with a slight sense of superiority.The youth called Mo Ling chuckled. \"I meant no offense. No one would dare to underestimate the Tianshu Province after they produced Jiang Qing'e.\"Mo Ling had feelings for Song Qiuyu. He had accompanied her back to the Tianshu Province on the pretext of protecting a beautiful lady.They were all students at the Astral Sage College.Mo Ling could tell that Song Qiuyu was not happy about the gathering of juniors below. He gave a slanted smile. \"I guess those peeps below could be considered our juniors next time we see them. Shall we go say hi?\"He had already risen to his feet.\"Forget it. They're inconsequential,\" Song Qiuyu said.Mo Ling waved her off. \"As their future senior, I feel it is necessary to familiarize them with the character of the Astral Sage College.\"He headed down.Song Qiuyu smiled, but she called out after him with a hint of impatience. \"Don't overdo it. Don't scare them.\"Difa Jingming downed his cup in one gulp. \"The night is long. Some entertainment sounds good.\"Neither were worried about Mo Ling. After all, he was at the second Resonant Master Stage, Pattern Genesis Tier. The students celebrating below, who were not even Tenth Seals, were like newly-hatched baby chicks compared to him.Precisely how big was the difference between the Ten Seals Stage and the Resonant Master Stage? They were about to be given a thrilling lesson on that just before entering the Astral Sage College.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, everyone was probably tired after the exams, so perhaps they should all head back for a good night's rest.The others were a little reluctant, but they still nodded agreement.Pa!Just at that moment, a crisp slap was heard outside the curtain. \"Watch where you're going, eh?\"Pulling aside the curtain, a Southwind student was clutching his face, staggering to the floor, dazed.Behind, a young man walked in, greeting them with a smile. \"Sorry for disturbing your celebration.\"\"This guy wasn't watching where he was going and bumped into me.\" He pointed at the youth on the floor.\"And so you hit him?\" Lu Qing'er said, raising an eyebrow coldly.Spotting her, a gleam entered his eyes. He had already identified this girl as something special while observing from upstairs. Up close, she was truly a delight. Those features, that bearing\u2014she was definitely a prize even in the Astral Sage College.He smiled apologetically at Lu Qing'er. \"Sorry. Reacted too quickly.\"\"You must be Southwind Academy students. Seems like you did well this year. I'm an Astral Sage College student. I'll probably be your senior in the future.\" Mo Ling grinned.Hearing this, the Southwind students looked at him in surprise. This person was from the Astral Sage College?Li Luo fixed him with a look. \"Seems like a hostile presence.\"\"I just wanted to meet the champion of the Tianshu Province's exams.\"Mo Ling said, looking back at him with a lopsided smile, \"But truly, an Eighth Seal taking first place? The Tianshu Province must have many troubles.\"A surge of angry glares.\"He's here to make trouble,\" Lu Qing'er said softly to Li Luo.He nodded almost imperceptibly, then stepped forwards to Mo Ling. \"Friend, we do not know each other,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"No need to cause trouble, right?\"Feigning surprise, Mo Ling said, \"What are you talking about? I'm just here to say hi as your future senior.\"\"You WHAT?! You want to assassinate me?!\" Li Luo shouted out hysterically.Mo Ling jumped. \"What\u2014assassinate?\"Was this guy wrong in the head? Since when had he ever said \u201cassassinate?\u201d He was just here to exact some petty revenge on Song Qiuyu's behalf.\"Protect the Young Lord!\"While he was still confused, a few figures appeared, resonant power at the ready. They were all at the Resonant Master Stage.These were Li Luo's bodyguards.Although House Luolan was not in a good situation, the Young Lord would still be accompanied by bodyguards. That was just common sense, wasn't it?Although these bodyguards rarely made their presence known, hearing the word \u201cassassinate\u201d brought them all ready to spring into action.They immediately rushed over without hesitation, crowding Mo Ling.His face changed. \"I didn't! I was just going to greet him!\" he cried.He was caught completely off guard. Before he had even started anything, this guy had already sicced his bodyguards on him.They ignored his protest and started to pummel him with resonant power-charged punches and kicks. Mo Ling hurriedly brought forth his own resonant power in defense.However, he was perhaps only as strong as one of the bodyguards. With so many of them around, he was soon yelping on the ground, enjoying knuckle sandwiches by the dozen.The Southwind Academy students were watching, astounded. This young lord was a real enigma. He had called the teacher last time, and this time it was bodyguards in action. It seemed like it was impossible to ever face him in a fair fight...Still, this time the guerilla tactics left them feeling extremely satisfied.Above, Song Qiuyu and Difa Jingming were shocked at the turn of events as well. Throwing down their cups, they hurried over.\"What are you doing?!\" the two shouted.They immediately called forth their own resonant power, ready to intervene.With a wave of his hand, Li Luo's bodyguards retreated, leaving Mo Ling on the floor, cradling his bruised face.\"Young Lord Li Luo, you're a tyrant. Why did you order your bodyguards to attack him?\" Song Qiuyu demanded.\"Brother.\" Difa Qing gasped at seeing Difa Jingming.\"That's Song Qiuyu, Song Yunfeng's elder sister. And Difa Jingming,\" Lu Qing'er said to Li Luo. \"This guy must be here to cause trouble on their behalf.\"Li Luo looked at the two and smiled. \"Are you with him? He tried to assassinate me. Could you two be the masterminds?\"Damn, flipping the metaphorical table right from the get go.\"Assassinate? Don't slander us! He's our friend, and he's just here to greet you as your senior.\" Song Qiuyu burst.Mo Ling crawled up from the floor as well, his face badly bruised. He glared angrily at Li Luo. \"When did I say that I was going to assassinate you?\"He was boiling with anger and humiliation. Damn, he hadn't even put his plan to motion before he was wrongly accused and jumped on.Shameless!Li Luo said in a hushed voice, \"I heard you say...\"Mo Ling shouted, \"I said I was here to say hi as your senior!\"\"Oh, is that what it was...\"Li Luo clapped his hands together. \"I've ruined things for many people today, so I was worried that there would be a few resentful ones who would try to kill me. I've been high-strung all day. I must have heard wrongly.\"Mo Ling shook in anger.\"How about this? I'll pay your tab today, as an apology,\" Li Luo said with a bright smile.Song Qiuyu's face was like ice. Given who they were, who would care about a table's tab? Li Luo had done this on purpose. Before Mo Ling could cause any trouble, he had decided to get the jump on him.\"Do I look like I need your paltry coins?\" Mo Ling spat at him.Li Luo smiled thinly at him. \"What else can I do?\"Song Qiuyu fell silent. They had intended to let Mo Ling come here and cause some trouble and anger Li Luo. He would probably lose his cool and challenge Mo Ling to a fight, then they could let him taste pain. But this Young Lord had none of that youthful hotheadedness, not even with a beautiful girl by his side.He was not a reckless one.And now that things had come to a head, they realized that they could not actually do anything to Li Luo, unless they wanted to jump him together and beat him up. But with so many bodyguards around, it would get really sticky.So finally, Song Qiuyu cast one more dark look at Li Luo, then she helped Mo Ling to his feet before leaving without a word.Difa Jingming was still regarding Li Luo. With a final smile, he turned to nod at Difa Qing, then he left with the others.Although they had left, the mood had been ruined, and the party broke up soon after.Li Luo and Lu Qing'er were standing at the foot of the Tower Qingfeng.\"Song Qiuyu is studying at the Resonance Tempering Hall in the Astral Sage College. She might have returned to challenge your Suncreek Villa,\" Lu Qing'er said.The Suncreek Villa had seen its production quality rise sharply thanks to Li Luo's spirit liquids. Their sales were booming, whereas Pine Nut Villa was gasping for air.\"Because of the Tianshu Province's Festival of Purifying Spirits next month?\" Li Luo murmured.Each year, the Tianshu Province would hold a festival related to spirit liquids and purifying lights. All of the brewers would take part, and there would be many games for them to win and vie for a larger share of the market.Li Luo also knew about it. The Suncreek Villa was currently busy with preparations.As for Song Qiuyu, she was probably back for the festival as well.Li Luo frowned slightly. The Suncreek Villa was blooming under his support. Sales were rising by the day, and skygold was flowing in like a river, all to help him secure the funds to buy more sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights.How could he let Song Qiuyu interfere with his greatest source of capital?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to greet the Southwind Academy students and talk about the Astral Sage College with them. Li Luo accused Mo Ling of trying to assassinate him and set his bodyguards on him,\" Song Qiuyu said irately.\"Hngh! Li Luo again!\"Song Shan sat down on the main chair, troubled and angry. Song Yunfeng being eliminated from the top 10 by Li Luo had made the joke of the Song family. And now treating their valued guest this way? It was too much.\"Brazen brat. If this happened in Xia City, he would be left eating through a straw!\" Mo Ling burst out angrily as well. He had been badly humiliated today, accused of being a killer before he had even done anything, and then beaten up badly.\"The Suncreek Villa has seen explosive growth since Li Luo took over too. Their first and second grade spirit liquids and purifying lights have improved greatly in quality, and our Pine Nut Villa is barely making ends meet. We think that he might be using a secret watersource. Perhaps Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan left it for him,\" Song Shan said tiredly.\"Our Pine Nut Villa's Wondrous Sunshine Light formula was corrected by a tempering master that I consulted in Xia City. It's definitely stronger than the Suncreek Villa's Azure Jade Spirit Liquid. But our tempering strength has fallen behind so much. A special watersource is the only explanation.\" Song Qiuyu frowned.\"If this continues, the Songs' Pine Nut Villa will be completely ruined by the Suncreek Villa,\" Song Shan grumbled.Song Qiuyu nodded with equal worry.Mo Ling looked at them and laughed. \"Qiuyu, why the long face? House Luolan's Suncreek Villa isn't that outstanding when you look at the whole of Xia. They're just big fish in the small pond of the Tianshu Province. Look at Xia City. How mediocre they are there!\"\"Those that do not bow when they speak have no back pains to complain of. Your Mo family's Inkwater Villa is among the best in the Xia Kingdom. Of course you can look down on the Suncreek Villa,\" Song Qiuyu groused.Mo Ling sighed. \"Haven't we talked about this? In the future, all of the third-grade and under spirit liquids and purifying lights from the Inkwater Villa can be sent to the Song family. The Song family will be the Inkwater Villa's retailer in the Tianshu Province.\"Our Inkwater Villa formulas are several cuts above the Suncreek Villa's. With that power, the Song family will definitely beat the Suncreek Villa flat.\"Song Shan's face was still doubtful even after such reassurance. \"But there are still some conditions yet to be worked out with the Inkwater Villa.\"Mo Ling made a grand gesture. \"Uncle Song, say no more. I know what you want. Part of the reason for my visit is to hammer out all the details on behalf of my elders. There are some concessions that the Inkwater Villa is willing to make. As long as our Inkwater spirit liquids and purifying lights can dominate the entire Tianshu market, both you and I will be winners.\"Besides, Li Luo is getting really cocky. I'm going to show him what it means to pay!\"\"Well...\"Song Shan finally smiled now, then he sighed with relief. \"I have much to thank you for. I know that the power of the Inkwater Villa is substantial, far more than what the Songs command. I will not say more, then, but I promise that the Song family will definitely help the Inkwater Villa gain footing here in the Tianshu Province.\"Mo Ling assured him it was nothing. After chatting a bit more with Song Qiuyu, he left to rest.After Mo Ling left, the shy smile on Song Qiuyu's face vanished. \"Looks like it was useful to bring him to the Tower Qingfeng today.\"\"I didn't expect Li Luo to act that way. Otherwise, Mo Ling would not have conceded so quickly. He would have played for more time if not for Li Luo.\"Song Shan sipped his tea, his expression cheerless. \"Who's to say that letting the Inkwater Villa into the Tianshu won't be akin to letting the proverbial wolf into the house? Although their spirit liquids and purifying lights' formulas will be handed over, I understand that those are unimportant. What is crucial are the secret watersource and lightsource, the Black Swampwater and the White Moonlight.\"It is these sources that make their Inkwater Villa formulas shine with full potential.\"We might be inviting them to wrap their hands around our throats instead.\"Song Qiuyu gave a soft laugh. \"Still, could it get any worse? Our market share in liquids and lights is paltry. Without strong support, we're just feeding the Suncreek Villa at this point.\"Song Shan sighed deeply. \"Damned House Luolan. Damned Li Luo. Damn it all.\"\"Do not worry. I came back home precisely for the Festival of Purifying Spirits. I will represent the Pine Nut Villa as the foremost resonance artificer. With my win and the support of the Inkwater Villa's spirit liquids and purifying lights, we will be able to turn things around,\" Song Qiuyu said.\"Your rival should be the Suncreek Villa's Yan Lingqing. Are you confident?\" Song Shan said.\"Yan Lingqing? Old rivals. We crossed paths countless times in the Astral Sage College.\"Song Qiuyu gave a cool smile. \"But this time, she will lose for sure.\"Song Shan nodded, feeling pleased.Song Qiuyu changed the topic. \"How is Yunfeng?\"\"Not badly injured, but devastated,\" Song Shan replied.In the preliminaries, Li Luo had managed to beat Song Yunfeng to a marginal draw thanks to the Water Mirror Art. Song Yunfeng had never once considered Li Luo an equal match, but now? In the exams, Li Luo had easily thrashed him, as if he were far below Li Luo in strength.It had crushed Song Yunfeng with a huge inferiority complex.\"Will he be able to make it into the Astral Sage College?\" Song Qiuyu scowled.Song Shan hesitated. At the behest of the Governor's Mansion, Song Yunfeng had ended up helping Shi Huang against Southwind Academy. It had invited much loathing. However, his position in the preliminaries was clear. One of Southwind Academy's entrance slots should go to him.However, however. Southwind Academy's old dean was a stubborn rock, hard and petty as could be. He had not even shown courtesy to Governor Shi. Who knew what he would do?\"I hope Wei Sha isn't too unreasonable about this.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0077\u2013 The Three Tiers of the Resonant Master StagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe excitement after the exams continued for many days in the City of Southwind. Such was its influence.After the exams, the students at Southwind Academy would have a week off before they went to school to get their entrance slots and officially end their term at Southwind.Because he had gotten first place, Li Luo was being given a lot more attention, which was frustrating for him. For these past few days, he had not even gone outside, instead choosing to stay at home, quietly researching resonance arts. In his free time, he studied spirit liquids and purifying lights.It was an idyllic but fruitful time....Ting!in a practice room in the old manor.Li Luo was throwing a barrage of attacks at full power with his shortswords.His target: a bodyguard in the old manor. He was at the first tier of the Resonant Master stage, the Sprouting Seed Tier, and he was holding back as he sparred with Li Luo.In resonance cultivation, the Resonant Master Stage came after the Ten Seals Stage.The Resonant Master Stage was divided into three tiers. The first tier was the Sprouting Seed Tier, where the resonant power in one's palaces would be gathered into a seed-like lump and then be reborn anew.The second tier was the Pattern Genesis Tier. At this tier, one's resonant power would start to mature and gain depth. This would create pattern marks across one's resonances, which were called resonance patterns, hence the name of the tier.The third tier was called the Evolving Resonance Tier. At this tier, one's resonances would begin to change, in preparation for the breakthrough to the next tier.If Ten Seals Stage cultivators were beginners, then it could be said that those at the Resonant Master Stage had finally taken a step into the door to cultivation.The difference between them was huge.As for how huge, Li Luo was all too aware as they crossed swords.Although the bodyguard was holding back his strength to roughly a Tenth Seal's, Li Luo found that none of his attacks could pose any threat to his opponent, unless he combined his swords and used his most powerful arrow.Ding!With a blue sheen of Water Edge on his swords, Li Luo chopped against the bodyguard's metal staff, but the rebounding shock sent him staggering back a few paces.He stopped, irritated. He flicked his hand towards his opponent, calling an end to it.\"Impressive, Young Lord. You're only an Eighth Seal, but I feel the pressure.\" The bodyguard cupped his fist in respect.This was not empty praise. After he suppressed his resonant power, he could feel that Li Luo's attacks were indeed posing a threat.There were other bodyguards watching the practice arena as well. They were nodding to themselves too, and they looked at Li Luo in a new light now\u2014with respect and satisfaction.His win at the Tianshu Province final examinations had forever banished his image as a useless cultivator with blank palaces.Even if Li Luo never reached Jiang Qing'e's level, no one would look down on him anymore.This young lord of House Luolan was gradually beginning to let his light shine.Li Luo responded with a smile and a nod, then he walked to the side of the training room. He spotted Cai Wei waiting for him there.Today she was in a red skirt, adorned with peony designs in lace. It was an intricate piece that only further emphasized her spicy bodyline. She was as alluring as a newly bloomed flower.In the sweaty heat of the training arena, many of the guys did not dare eye her openly, but they still surreptitiously snuck glances.The admiring gaze that was the nature of guys.\"Sister Cai Wei.\" Li Luo greeted her with a smile.\"The Young Lord is very diligent, training so hard even after your win,\" she said fondly.\"First place in the Tianshu Province doesn't hold much weight. I heard that the champions in the stronger provinces were Tenth Seal cultivators.\" He shook his head.His words were true. The Tianshu Province hovered around the middle in the Xia Kingdom. There were stronger provinces elsewhere.\"You were looking for me?\" Li Luo asked.\"Lingqing came over, so something's probably up,\" Cai Wei said.\"Let's go, then,\" he nodded.They left the training arena together, walking through a long corridor to a living room where they met Yan Lingqing, currently clad in green. She had on a pair of silver rims, which made her look especially strict.She started speaking the moment they were seated. \"Let me give you the update. Recently, the Suncreek Villa's profits have been huge, thanks to the secret watersource you've been providing. If the current profits keep up, this year's revenue could be one million skygold. Subtracting away the capital, we would still have 300,000 skygold in profits.\"Li Luo was exuberant. 300,000 skygold was the entire profit of House Luolan in the Tianshu Province each year. This year, the Suncreek Villa alone had achieved that. It was tremendous.Of course, this was mainly because of the secret watersource that he had been providing. And now that he was an Eighth Seal, he could provide even more than before. Therefore, the watersource's usage had also expanded to their second-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights, contributing to an explosion in their revenue.He did some rough calculations. 300,000 skygold should be able to get him about ten sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights......Too few.Li Luo was resigned to it. He knew how hard it was to enhance acquired resonances.Finishing her report, Yan Lingqing continued, \"Did you meet Song Qiuyu a few days ago at the Tower Qingfeng? Was there a guy called Mo Ling with them?\"Li Luo nodded, surprised. \"That guy was trying to cause trouble. We had an altercation.\"\"Mo Ling is from the Mo family in theBeiqiu Province. They're one of the major families dealing in spirit liquids and purifying lights. Their Inkwater Villa ranks in the top 10 in the whole Xia Kingdom. Their connections run very deep.\u201d\"According to our information, the Song family might choose to work with the Inkwater Villa and bring them into the Tianshu Province to crush the Suncreek Villa,\" Cai Wei said softly.Li Luo frowned. The Song family had called for aid.\"It must have been Song Qiuyu who instigated that meeting at the Tower Qingfeng. She must have purposely set up the clash between Mo Ling and you to help ease their alliance.\"\"That woman has a calculative mind. There's nothing she won't stop at to get her way,\" Yan Lingqing said in a disapproving way.Li Luo gave a helpless smile. So he had inadvertently helped Song Qiuyu. He had underestimated her.\"Song Qiuyu must be back to take part in the Festival of Purifying Spirits next month. She will probably compete to be the best resonance artificer in the Tianshu Province, lending more strength to the Pine Nut Villa,\" Yan Lingqing said.\"Sister Yan, you're the representative of the Suncreek Villa. Can you beat her?\" Li Luo asked.\"We are old rivals\u2014we clashed many times in the Astral Sage College. We had wins and losses. I don't know how this match will turn out, but I will not underestimate her. I'll do my best to prepare,\" Yan Lingqing said, her fighting spirit glowing from behind her silver-rimmed spectacles. Song Qiuyu had ignited a spark in her.\"Seems like Sister Lingqing's archenemy,\" Li Luo joked.\"When you get to the Astral Sage College, you'll know just how sour things were between us.\" Yan Lingqing pulled a face before turning serious again. \"But I'm worried that they will force the Inkwater Villa's liquids and lights into our market.\"\"How good are the Inkwater Villa's products?\" Li Luo asked.\"If they enter the Tianshu Province, they're probably targeting third-grade and below. From what I know, the Inkwater Villa's first-grade product is called the Blackstar spirit liquid, tempering strength of 62%.\"Their second-grade product is called the Blackmoon spirit liquid, tempering strength of 61%.\"\"And the third-grade product, the Blackglory purifying light, has a tempering strength 60%.\"Li Luo's eyebrows shot up. That was truly an established shop in spirit liquids and purifying lights. Such products outclassed anything the Suncreek Villa could offer, and they would be even further behind if not for his watersource.However, he was not too worried. While their formula might not be as polished, Li Luo was confident they had the advantage in watersource.The first batch of improved Azure Jade spirit liquid that the Suncreek Villa was currently offering was still based on his fifth-grade waterlight resonance. Therefore, if Li Luo wished, he could create an even purer batch of watersource... by far.Because it had been sufficient so far, he had not brought it up. But if the Inkwater Villa was going to push the issue, then he was going to bring out the big guns.The three continued to discuss matters for a while, then Yan Lingqing left hurriedly to prepare for the Festival of Purifying Spirits.After she left, Cai Wei suddenly retrieved three glass phials from her bosom, setting them gently before Li Luo.\"This...\"Li Luo's gaze was drawn to them. There were faint light patterns on them. They were clearly of a much higher quality than any spirit liquids or purifying lights he had seen before.And he could sense the powerful flowing within the phials.\"Sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights?\" Incredulous joy spread across his face.He had been using the remaining fifth-grade ones, but he found them sorely lacking in efficacy after his waterlight resonance reached the sixth-grade. He had been agonizing over it for a long time. He wanted to ask Cai Wei to procure some, but the price made him hold his tongue. He eventually decided to purchase them after he made it to Xia City.But now Cai Wei had given him a wonderful surprise.\"Young Lord, although I don't know why you can use seemingly unlimited amounts of spirit liquids and purifying lights, I'm not too curious. Your recent performance proves that they are worth it.\"Therefore, even though our cash flow is tight, your sister here scrimped and saved to help you secure these three sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. It's not much, but they should prove useful,\" Cai Wei said, glowing with pride. Her goose-egg face shone with radiance.Li Luo eagerly took them. He turned to Cai Wei, moved. \"If I wasn't afraid of being beaten by Sister Cai Wei, I would have hugged you already.\"Cai Wei laughed cutely, fanning herself with her flower fan as she batted her eyelashes at him.\"Save that talk for the girls at your school. To an older woman like myself, those honeyed words hold less power than that pretty face of yours.\"She left, her figure swaying in a stirring fashion.Li Luo watched her sexy figure go. He absently touched his cheek and sighed.Damned good looks. Even Sister Cai Wei couldn't help herself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Standing outside the campus, he looked upon the familiar gates with nostalgia.Today, he would formally end his term at Southwind Academy. All those years of memories, come to a close.Still, whatever the future brought, Li Luo knew that his cultivation at Southwind Academy had molded him for years to come.The way that he still held an aversion to being in the spotlight was because of his hubris back when he had first entered Southwind. From his heroic ways to a blank palace cultivator, he had tasted both heaven and hell.The lesson had nurtured him not to show himself. He would rather hide himself tightly, grow in secret. Perhaps one day, when he was a Duke or King, he could relax a little.Unfortunately, these exams had undone all of his past anonymity.\"Damned Shi Huang, damned Song Yunfeng...\"Li Luo cursed. He just wanted to breeze into the top 10, but those two bastards had forced his hand into taking first place.\"And that Lu Qing'er as well. It was obviously her win...\" Li Luo continued muttering.\"Ungrateful, aren't we? I let you win, and you're muttering behind my back,\" said a lighthearted girl's voice.Li Luo turned to see Lu Qing'er, dressed in Southwind Academy's uniform. Her willowy legs extended out beautifully from the short, black skirt, dipping down under her knee-high white socks. The creamy thighs sandwiched between them were riveting.Li Luo chuckled dryly.Lu Qing'er did not mind him. She stepped forth to walk by Li Luo's side, a small smile on her face.They were like the perfect couple, a hunk and a babe. Envious glances came from all around.Before, some taunting remarks would have made their way in, but now that Li Luo was the champion, his reputation had started to overtake Lu Qing'er's.As they walked in, many called out greetings, and they nodded appropriately in response.After passing through a boulevard, they heard shouting up ahead, where a crowd was forming.\"Song Yunfeng, you loser, you dare show your face at Southwind Academy?\" And other such remarks were being thrown around.Li Luo's eyes widened. Song Yunfeng? He dared to come to Southwind Academy?He quickened his steps, squeezing through the crowd with Lu Qing'er. He saw Song Yunfeng dressed in black, red-faced. He was flanked by two alert bodyguards from the Song family, here to protect him.In front of Song Yunfeng was a familiar figure, groaning and frothing blood at the mouth.Li Luo looked closer. Wasn't that Yu Lang?What was that guy playing at?\"Brother Luo, Sister Qing, thank goodness you're here. This Song Yunfeng is too much. He not only dared to return after betraying Southwind Academy, he even slapped Yu Lang unconscious after he tried to greet him. It's outrageous!\" The students clamored upon seeing the duo.Li Luo was alarmed. Was Song Yunfeng really so boorish? He had to be aware that he had incurred the public wrath. Would he still start fights?Li Luo rubbed his nose. There was more going on here than there appeared to be.Especially... whenever it involved the slippery Yu Lang.He stared at the groaning Yu Lang. His acting was way overboard. He had much to learn from Zhao Kuo.\"You're full of shit. I didn't beat him, I just asked him to leave me alone and shoved him. I didn't even use strength!\" Song Yunfeng asserted furiously, a vein throbbing on his temple.He had not wanted to come to Southwind Academy at all, but the dean had sent a message to the Song family, saying that all who did not come personally to pick up their entrance slots would be automatically forfeited.Therefore, Song Yunfeng had no choice but to come, knowing the barrage of backlash that was sure to follow.Li Luo and Lu Qing'er shared a look. They ignored Song Yunfeng, sensing that there were larger factors at play here.And soon enough, a bunch of campus security was hurrying over, aggressively accosting Song Yunfeng and his bodyguards.\"What are you doing!?\" the bodyguards shouted.\"You dare to beat up students on Southwind Academy's school grounds? Are you tired of living?!\" the security personnel shouted. With a huge surge of resonant power, they seized the two bodyguards and Song Yunfeng all together.From behind, the dean emerged, a whole group of teachers surrounding him.They were all looking angry, especially the dean. His shouting began from afar. \"You brazen dimwit, you've gone too far now. Do you think I'm already in the grave? How dare you disrespect Southwind Academy's rules!\"The old dean's rage had many students cringing in fear.Song Yunfeng's heart sank, uneasiness flooding through him.Looking about, the old dean seemed to spot the fallen Yu Lang. \"Song Yunfeng,\" he cried, \"you are heartless and cruel! You crippled him!\"Song Yunfeng was seething with rage. This was too much. He had only pushed Yu Lang away. Crippling? That was slander!The dean paid no attention to his furious gaze. \"From now on, I rescind the student status of Song Yunfeng from Southwind Academy!\"Throw them out!\"The security team obliged, casting the three out.Song Yunfeng still struggled furiously. \"I don't accept it! You can't kick me out, I've broken no rules!\"The dean looked at him coldly. \"Report me, then, if you don't accept it. Go tell the Astral Sage College. When they send out the order to fire me, you can enter the Astral Sage College.\"Song Yunfeng's furious shouting faded away as he was dragged out, finally vanishing from earshot.\"That acting was too dramatic,\" Li Luo said to Lu Qing'er in a low tone.\"If Song Yunfeng had made it into the top 10, then there would be nothing the dean could do about his entrance slot. But since you ensured he was out of it, the dean has many ways to deny him the placement,\" Lu Qing'er whispered back.\"Other deans might respect the rules, but our dean is a bit of a small-minded guy. He would throw away his pride to get the last word in an argument.\"A hush fell over the crowd as Song Yunfeng was dragged out, and then a smattering of knowing applause.The old dean put up a smug hand in acknowledgment, then indicated that they should disperse. He prodded the still-moaning Yu Lang with his toe. \"Your acting needs work. If not for my lack of shame, we wouldn't have pulled it off.\"Yu Lang sprang to his feet, groaning. \"Dean, Sir, your sudden mission gave me no time to prepare. Feelings need to be properly calibrated, y'know?\"The old dean harrumphed, but a smile remained on his weathered features.\"I can tolerate students not contributing to Southwind Academy's glory, but not those that betray us knowingly.\"No matter how much trouble it invites, I won't give them an ounce of Southwind's spoils.\"Li Luo chuckled. The old dean's pettiness was legendary, but today it seemed quite adorable to many students.At least it had forced the unlawful expulsion of Song Yunfeng... Perhaps there was some merit to it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They would be heading to other college-level institutions all across the Xia Kingdom, continuing their cultivation or turning to other occupations. They might never meet again.After the ceremony, Li Luo, Lu Qing'er, Yu Lang, and Zhao Kuo received a private summons from the dean to his garden.\"Thanks to you four, Southwind Academy has managed to keep the best school title this year. I guess I owe you thanks,\" he said, smiling at them over the bush he was pruning.Zhao Kuo made a non-committal incline with his head. He knew that he had not done much other than ride Li Luo's coattails to glory.Yu Lang, on the other hand, was smiling as bravely as though he had bled and fought for Southwind Academy.\"Sir, it seems unnecessary to call us here just for thanks,\u201d Li Luo said.\"Am I really such a dead plank to you?\" the dean replied irritably.\"Dean, Sir!\" Yu Lang burst out. \"You are my most respected person. I won't let you speak about yourself that way. Take the word 'dead' out!\"The dean brandished his shears threateningly at Yu Lang, who leaped back in alarm.\"Hmph.\"From now on, you're not students of Southwind Academy. In two months, all of you will be headed for the Astral Sage College. That is the place where you young ones can chase your dreams. But regardless of where you eventually land, you will always be my Southwind Academy alumni.\"Although you all did quite well in the exam, that's no basis for arrogance. When you get to the Astral Sage College, you'll learn just how vast the Xia Kingdom is. There are plenty of crouching tigers and hidden dragons.\"Of course... If you can become like Jiang Qing'e, you can ignore what I just said.\"They nodded. Besides the more flighty Yu Lang, the other three were solid, grounded characters. Especially Li Luo. If not for this final exam, he would still be happily burrowed in anonymity, his bottomline untested.After his short parting speech, the dean reached into the folds of his clothes and pulled out pale-yellow pills. Puffs of fragrance came from them.\"These are Bitter Lotus Pills. When your resonant power reaches the Tenth Seal level, you may use one. They will accelerate your resonance consolidation, increasing the chances of success. Take these as an additional reward from the exams.\"The four were delighted. Pills were a rare sight, unlike spirit liquids and purifying lights, which were consumed in large quantities. They were more pricey, and it was an extremely generous gesture on the dean's part.They had heard that Bitter Lotus Pills were distilled from the sap of trees of resonant power. Only large schools could cultivate such things. And for beginners still in the Ten Seals Stage, there was no better medicine than the Bitter Lotus Pill.Many people failed multiple times when condensing their resonances. This cost them precious cultivation time. The Bitter Lotus Pill could steady their transition.\"Sir, if anyone calls you a plank to my face, I'll be the first to teach them a lesson!\" Yu Lang vowed fervently.The old man shot him a sideways look but decided against replying to this slippery character. He handed over the pills.\"Go, then. I hate to admit it, but the Astral Sage College is truly an elite school, peerless in all of Xia.\"You'll only come in touch with the true reality of this world after you enter the Astral Sage College.\"Your futures are bright. I will be eagerly listening out for news of you here in Southwind Academy.\"Hearing the grudging honesty in his voice, the four were a little moved. They bowed to him and turned to leave.He laughed, calling after Li Luo, \"Boy, you've made your parents proud.\"Li Luo halted. Looking up to the clouds rolling by above, he felt a lump in his throat. He had thought himself impervious to what others said, but the old dean's words had touched something within him. Perhaps all his hard work had not been for naught.Deep down, he knew that it was not that he wasn't concerned with the opinions of others, but simply that he cared too much about not letting his parents down.He loved those seemingly unreliable parents very much.And they loved him as well....After the Southwind graduation, Li Luo again returned to his previous rhythm. Just as he had said, he did not slack off just because of his victory. In the larger scheme of things, the exam was nothing but a small skirmish.After two months of holidays, he would head for the Astral Sage College. There, he would see the true crop of talent that existed in the Xia Kingdom.But this time, he swore to be even more anonymous at the Astral Sage College.In these two months, Li Luo set himself a target. He wanted to reach the Tenth Seal. If he could, he might even try consolidating his resonances and entering the Resonant Master Stage!He had heard of other province winners being Tenth Seals. In another two months, the truly elite students could be at the first tier of the Resonant Master Stage already. Li Luo felt that he could not let up.Of course, this was not the most important thing... His life was already ticking down from its five-year limit!Although it was important to keep his head down, it was also important to survive!...The holidays slowly rifted by. After about half a month, Li Luo found that he had reached the Ninth Seal, as he expected.Besides that, his practice with spirit liquids and purifying lights had seen swift improvements. He could already brew second-grade liquids and lights, and he could be considered a qualified second-grade resonance artificer.All in all, Li Luo was pretty satisfied with the progress that he had made in this half a month.As his resonant power inched ever closer to the Resonant Master Stage, Li Luo started to leaf through the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art that his parents had left him. There was another important question to consider. After he reached the Resonant Master Stage, what primary and secondary resonance should he fill his second palace with?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0080\u2013 Acquired Resonance Godly Forging WheelPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBedroom.Sunlight filtered in through the window, landing on Li Luo's back. He had a jade-tablet scroll in his hands, held up to his brow. His eyes were closed as he flipped through it.On the jade-tablet scroll was the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art that his parents had left him.A long time later, he finally opened his eyes. He massaged his brow lightly. Despite his fatigue, his eyes were full of fire.Li Luo had been looking forward to his second acquired resonance for a long time.As he finally started to get familiar with the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art, Li Luo was starting to realize just how hard it was to get acquired resonances.The Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art was made of many materials imbued with various strands of energies that were forged into the required object. For example, in order to forge an acquired fire resonance, one would need to find all sorts of fire-energy materials and then use a special method to forge and temper them until their varied energies reached harmony. And then one would need to use blood essence from one's own spirit soul to activate it. Finally, you would have produced a passable acquired resonance.The most tedious part of this process was accumulating the materials, and the repeated calibrations to find a harmony.In other words, the Godly Forging Art was not just a labor of skill, but also one of hard work.After reading the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art, Li Luo knew that much of his remaining years would be spent on this.But the good news was that Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan had left some notes at the back of the jade-tablet scroll detailing some of their past attempts. This was valuable experience that could help Li Luo save precious time, something that he barely had.Most importantly, they had left him a hint. It was a suggestion that perhaps it would be good if the primary attribute of his second acquired resonance was wood.The reason for this was tied to the blood essence and lifespan that Li Luo had lost in gaining his first acquired resonance. Although the waterlight resonance could help replenish losses, for safety's sake, a wood resonance was a good insurance policy.This was because a wood resonance would not only have restorative properties, it would also have detoxifying properties. It would further boost his survivability. With water, wood, and light resonances, any damage that Li Luo took would no longer hurt his core.\"Wood resonance, eh...\"Li Luo lapsed into deep thought. He had originally thought to choose an offensive second resonance. But his parents had suggested the wood resonance. He would have to adjust his thinking.Well, his waterlight resonance had been sufficiently modified, and he was getting by offensively. Perhaps a primary wood resonance would be workable.Besides, the wood resonance was more about control. He could explore that further. First trap his opponent, then make them a pincushion for his arrows.Still, that didn't seem very fitting. Maybe he would be seen as a sadist who loved torture...Regardless, he already had handsome looks. No need to care about how he looked when he fought.Li Luo made his decision. Channeling resonant power to his palm, he pressed it on the jade-tablet scroll.Twang!A beam of light shot out from the scroll, pouring out before expanding. Finally, it took shape as a six-colored wheel of light.On the wheel of light, there were many holes. 128 of them, to be precise. One side had 86, the other 42.The one with more holes was the primary, the one with less was the secondary.And in the center of the wheel was a curious indent with many arcane patterns running out from it.This was the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Wheel.This was a support item that was crucial to getting an acquired resonance. It was fairly tricky to make, definitely way beyond Li Luo's current abilities. Luckily, his parents had left him one.If he wanted to forge his second acquired resonance, he would have to gather all sorts of materials and learn special methods to distill them. Finally, he would have to fill the holes on the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Wheel. When both sides were fully complete, he would have to add his own spirit soul and blood essence to finish it.Li Luo stared at the six-colored light wheel for a long time, then he shook the jade-tablet scroll to stow it away.If wood was going to be the primary attribute, what about the secondary? How should he choose?He sat in front of the hearth, deep in thought.The harsh rays of sunlight gently transitioned into the dull red of evening.Li Luo finally exhaled deeply and put brush briefly to paper. He wrote two words.Wood.Earth.This was the best he had come up with. Primary wood, secondary earth.Woodearth resonance!Since wood's specialty was in control, then it should be honed to the fullest. The best support for a wood resonance was an earth resonance.Their synergy would further reinforce the control he could bring.Besides, both water and light would synergize quite well with a wood resonance as well.And the defenses of an earth resonance would further help his survivability...For all these reasons, Li Luo made his decision.Done, he hesitated no longer, leaving the room in search of Cai Wei at the old manor. He told her his request.\"Young Lord, you need materials with wood and earth energies?\" Although Cai Wei found this request strange, she accepted.\"There are some leftover things in the old manor's storehouse. I will retrieve them for you. If they are insufficient, I'll send someone to purchase what you need from the market.\"Although these materials were not cheap, the Suncreek Villa was swimming in skygold. Much of the financial pressure had been alleviated, so they were no longer forced to pinch pennies like they did at the start.\"Thanks, Sister Cai Wei.\"Li Luo gave her a jaunty wave and left her to her business.Her lovely eyes watched his back, and she smiled as well. She could sense that Li Luo was in a good mood today.After putting away her account book, she personally went to take care of his errand.Thanks to her frightful efficiency, she had the first batch of materials delivered to his room within two hours.In the room.Li Luo pulled out a green plant from a jade box. It had green, windchime-shaped flowers.This was a woodbell flower, a rare flower with wood properties.Mouthing the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art's incantation, Li Luo pressed it with his fingers and pushed his resonant power in.Weng, weng!After a moment, a thumb-sized flame appeared on his palm. This flame was special. It had a translucent sheen to it, as though devoid of any element.\"This is the Acquired Resonance Flame?\"Li Luo looked at it curiously. The flame was the core of the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art, and only materials forged within the Acquired Resonance Flame could become acquired resonances.However, Li Luo's own resonant power was still too weak. That was why the Acquired Resonance Flame he had summoned was only a small one.\"Well, I'll do my best.\"Li Luo shook his head exasperatedly. Plucking one woodbell flower, he lit it with the Acquired Resonance Flame.However, he failed to control the heat properly the first time, reducing it to smoking ash.No matter, failure was the mother of success.The second, third, and fourth woodbell flowers all met the same fate.\"Come on! Why's it so hard?\" Li Luo was feeling frustrated now. He could only take it as a learning experience. He moved on to another material and tried again.After burning away several materials, Li Luo finally felt like he was getting the hang of things. He finally managed to forge a rare grass with earth properties.He formed a dark-brown liquid, which he put into one of the holes on the six-colored light wheel. It immediately lit up, shining with a faint light, and a connection formed to the hole beside it.Li Luo's heart leaped when he saw this. He forged yet another material, this time putting it into the hole that was connected.However, the moment he added it, the six-colored light wheel started to quiver, as though trying to expel the material.A rejection reactionLi Luo hurriedly pulled it out. This meant that the material was not suited for his acquired resonance.Next, Li Luo continued to try out various kinds, until he finally found one that was not rejected.With the second hole filled, another strand of light extended out from it towards a third hole...Li Luo would have to fill all the holes on the six-colored light wheel, and also achieve a balance between the primary and secondary sides before the acquired resonance was properly forged.But when night fell, Li Luo had only managed to fill four holes. And he was completely drained.This was an exhausting process.However, he was not impatient. After all, he was still some time away from the Resonant Master Stage. Before that, he had time to slowly experiment with materials and piece the six-colored light wheel together.That would be the time when he would get his second acquired resonance.He could not wait.1. It's hard to explain exactly what the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art is written on, but you can imagine many jade tablets strung together to form a long scroll. Here are some images:Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was still at the Ninth Seal. Evidently, progress slowed as one climbed. Previously, he had been helped by the aid of the skygold room, not to mention he had kept up his studies despite his blank palaces. That had helped him to accrue some latent potential.But now all that was spent. His cultivation speed had returned to normal.Also, now that the examinations had been over for a month, the excitement was finally dying down. Now the Tianshu citizens were turning their attention to another major event on the horizon.The Festival of Purifying Spirits.In this world of resonances, the importance of resonances could not be overstated. They determined one's cultivation. They determined everything.And spirit liquids and purifying lights could improve one's resonance grade. They were consumables that could not be missed out on. Therefore, anything that concerned these liquids and lights would always attract attention.After all, the examinations were mere entertainment for those not involved. Spirit liquids and purifying lights, however, affected every single person's own abilities!The Festival of Purifying Spirits would attract all of the villas across the Tianshu Province. They would send their finest resonance artificers to fight for the title of Artificer Prime. Having the Prime would greatly improve the reputation of the villa, and affect its market share.The profits at stake were enormous.All of the villas in the Tianshu Province had started preparations long ago, including House Luolans' Suncreek Villa....The venue of the festival was one of the arenas in the City of Southwind.Li Luo arrived with Cai Wei, and he was surprised by the number of people. \"It's really crowded,\" he remarked.\"The festival has already been underway for three days. But so far it has been just a product exhibit. The real show starts today,\" Cai Wei replied.\"How is Sister Lingqing doing?\" Li Luo asked.\"No idea. She was buried in her books for a long time, and I didn't dare to disturb her. But she's already here. You can ask her yourself.\" Cai Wei shrugged.Li Luo nodded. The two walked towards the area that the Suncreek Villa had been allocated. They found Yan Lingqing leaning on the rail and looking towards the center, where a refining platform was being assembled. Evidently, the tempering contest today would be held there.\"Seems like Sister Lingqing is really serious about today,\" Li Luo called out.Yan Lingqing propped up her silver-rimmed spectacles. \"I don't mind losing to anyone besides Song Qiuyu,\" she said mildly.\"And are you confident?\" Li Luo asked.Yan Lingqing fell silent. \"Both Song Qiuyu and I are fourth-grade resonance artificers. We should be pretty evenly matched. I've chosen a fourth-grade spirit liquid that I'm most familiar with. I can consistently produce it at about 58% to 60%. And as far as I know, the fourth-grade liquids and lights that Song Qiuyu has produced so far are just a little behind that.\"If nothing has changed drastically, my chances of victory are slightly higher.\"But the Song family is working with THE Inkwater Villa now,\" Cai Wei chimed in doubtfully. \"They're going all out. Would they prepare something special...\"She looked around them carefully. \"Do you think Song Qiuyu will bring out a fifth-grade liquid or light?\"\"Impossible!\" Yan Lingqing immediately replied. \"I have only barely grasped the basics of a fifth-grade resonance artificer, and all my attempts to temper a fifth-grade spirit liquid have resulted in failure. How could Song Qiuyu achieve it?\"Seeing her so resolute, Cai Wei desisted. After all, Yan Lingqing was the expert in spirit liquids and purifying lights. She knew her field best.Li Luo smiled. \"It seems like everyone can bring an assistant when tempering. Have you chosen yours, Sister Lingqing?\"She turned her beautiful eyes to him. \"You don't trust me?\"\"I'm just concerned,\" Li Luo replied sincerely. \"I don't really mind if Sister Lingqing wins or loses. Even if you lose, I don't think a swing in reputation will affect the quality of the Suncreek Villa's spirit liquids. There really isn't a need to feel too pressured.\"Her look softened. \"I'm not pressured,\" she replied out of habit.But as she turned away, she looked back, lifting her sharp chin ever so slightly. \"But if you want to be my assistant, feel free to do so. You're the Young Lord anyway. Not like I can control you.\"Li Luo grinned. Her aloof character was quite endearing.After tying up the conversation, he went into the arena, planning to look around at other spirit liquids and purifying lights.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing watched him from the balcony. The former smiled. \"Seems like our Young Lord has quite the tender side to him.\"Yan Lingqing sniffed. \"Kids are meddlesome. Even if something really crops up, what can a second-grade resonance artificer do to save the situation?\"\"Harsh words. I sensed you were moved back there though,\" Cai Wei teased.\"Huh!? I have fawners aplenty! You think those few words can move my stone heart? Do you know what my nickname was back in the Resonance Tempering Hall?\"Stone Hearted Maiden!\" Yan Lingqing proudly puffed out her chest.Cai Wei pulled a face. \"What's there to be proud of? Did you temper your brain into a spirit liquid by any chance?\"Besides... that pose doesn't suit you.\"Yan Lingqing glared at her. Wicked vixen! How dare she make fun of her figure!\u201cI'll get you!\u201dShe reached out a naughty hand to tickle Cai Wei's tummy and chest.The two women squealed mischievously on the balcony, looking like a pair of young girls....Not fortunate enough to see this, Li Luo was ambling around the arena aimlessly, browsing through the products of the various villas.He was a second-grade resonance artificer after all. Being exposed to more products would broaden his understanding of spirit liquids and purifying lights.He indeed learned quite a lot from his wanderings.After quite some time, Li Luo finally decided to head back when he suddenly saw a familiar figure.Lu Qing'er.Today she was dressed in a fashionably pale green. Her short skirt was paired with white lace socks. Her lovely looks were complemented by the white parasol she was holding. She was constantly drawing looks from others.However, there was a nasty fly hovering nauseatingly near her.It was a familiar figure. Mo Ling, who they had clashed with back at the Tower Qingfeng.This guy was a real playboy. Despite his obvious intentions towards Song Qiuyu, he was still flirting.He was standing by her side, smiling happily as he tried to chat her up. Lu Qing'er was keeping her expression under control, but Li Luo knew that her lack of expression indicated that she was irritated.He snuck up on them and whispered.\"Selling flyswatters. 5,000 skygold apiece.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She turned to face Li Luo with a happy gleam in her eye.Her girlish smile was a stark contrast to the stony expression from before.\"Your flyswatter's too expensive. Trying to rip me off?\" Lu Qing'er laughed.\"Can't be helped. Your fly's too big. I suspect it's perverted,\" Li Luo said with full seriousness.The corners of her mouth twitched.Mo Ling's face darkened. \"Li Luo, trying to start something?\"\"I'm just talking with a schoolmate. None of your business.\" Li Luo smiled.\"Well, I'm your senior. You're being rude,\" Mo Ling said coolly. \"That attitude is going to make you pay when you're in the Astral Sage College.\"\"Then I guess I'll bring a few more bodyguards with me,\" Li Luo replied.Mo Ling's eyes flashed. He knew that Li Luo was reminding him of the Tower Qingfeng incident. Still, he knew that there was no point in kicking up a fuss now. He swallowed his anger. \"Laugh while you can, Li Luo. After today, the Inkwater Villa's spirit liquids and purifying lights will dominate the Tianshu Province, and your Suncreek Villa will be screwed.\"He stomped off.Li Luo shook his head. \"How did you attract such a wasp?\" he asked, turning to Lu Qing'er.She glared at him. \"Nonsense. I was just wandering around. No idea why he would come over.\"She was annoyed that Li Luo had implied that she had invited him.Li Luo hurriedly pacified her. \"My bad, my bad. Sister Qing'er is as pretty as a floating lotus. You were unlucky to float into a pile of cow turd.\"She rolled her eyes at him, slightly mollified. \"The Inkwater Villa has established an alliance with the Song family. They will definitely make their move during the festival,\" she said with a hint of worry.\"Don't worry. I'm prepared,\" Li Luo said indifferently, waving it off.Lu Qing'er was a little curious, but she did not press further. Instead, she stared closely at Li Luo. \"You're a Ninth Seal already?\"\"You're a Tenth Seal already?\" Li Luo countered. Their physical closeness allowed him to detect the faint frost energy she was emitting. It was much colder than before.Clearly, her resonant power had gotten even more robust.She was a Ninth Seal before, and reaching the Tenth Seal by this month was normal.She nodded slightly. She was holding a parasol due to the hot weather, and now she inclined it slightly to shade Li Luo as well. \"I can probably reach the first tier of the Resonant Master Stage before I enter the Astral Sage College.\"\"Impressive.\" Li Luo whistled, giving her a big thumbs up.\"You should buck up too. Don't think we'll be anything special in the Astral Sage College just because we ranked first and second in the Tianshu Province. The other newcomers from stronger provinces will be really intense.\"\"I heard that there's a streaming competition when we get in, that decides what class we go to. It will be far harder than the College Final Examinations,\" Lu Qing'er told him severely.Li Luo nodded. Of course he would not underestimate the other newcomers. He wasn't qualified to do so. The Tianshu Province was only mid-tier in Xia Kingdom. If he really thought first place in the Tianshu Province meant anything, then he would truly be a fool.As the two chatted pleasantly, Mo Ling had stalked off angrily to the Pine Nut Villa. He spotted Song Qiuyu watching the crowd.\"Who's pissed you off now?\" She snickered at him.\"Met that Li Luo again. Grr,\" Mo Ling said, grinding his teeth.\"No worries. After today, I think he'll regret the way he's treated you,\" Song Qiuyu said uncaringly.Mo Ling nodded, his expression softening. \"Are you ready?\"\"I'm roughly as strong as Yan Lingqing, but with your Mo family's secret recipe, I will definitely beat her. Hehe, I can't wait. That little squirt was really stuck up. I'm going to enjoy the look on her face when I beat her,\u201d Song Qiuyu said gleefully.Hearing her coquettish laugh while he enjoyed the view of her hourglass figure, Mo Ling was starting to feel an itch in his heart. He reached out towards her waist.She twisted away, teasing him. \"If my father sees you, you had better be ready to propose marriage or leave Tianshu.\"Mo Ling hurriedly replied, \"I don't mind getting engaged immediately, as long as you are willing.\"\"Let's wait for a good time.\" She smiled.He could only nod.She again turned to the arena below, her eyes losing their warmth. Of course she had seen Mo Ling flirting with Lu Qing'er. The guy did his thinking with his lower half. If he wasn't still useful to her, she would have ignored him.However, they still needed the Inkwater Villa's help to deal with the Suncreek Villa. For now, she would have to endure him. She could kick him away once her mission was accomplished.A gong interrupted her thoughts, and there was a pronounced increase in the crowd's chatter.Song Qiuyu looked eagerly. Finally, the tempering contest was here.When the gong sounded, Li Luo and Lu Qing'er also followed the crowd towards the center of the arena.Li Luo could see that Yan Lingqing had already made her way there. Her willowy figure, silver-rimmed spectacles, and long, flowing hair had caught the eye of many men.\"Does House Luolan hire based on looks? That majordomo Cai Wei is a real looker, and this president of the Suncreek Villa is an ice queen too.\" Lu Qing'er teased him as she checked out Yan Lingqing.Li Luo had no immediate rejoinder to that. After all, both women were indeed great beauties. If others did not know that Jiang Qing'e was the one who had arranged for them to come here, he would indeed be slandered as a playboy.\"I'm heading over to Second Uncle's side. Want to come with?\" She crooked a finger towards the Golden Dragon Bank's seats on the spectator platform. Although the Golden Dragon Bank was not a villa, their deep business connections made them interested in the proceedings as well.Li Luo shook his head and smiled. \"I'm going up.\" He indicated to the arena.Lu Qing'er's surprise showed. \"You're competing in the tempering arts?\"\"I'm just going to assist Sister Lingqing. And gain some exposure. After all, I'm a resonance artificer too.\" Li Luo grinned.\"I'll be rooting for you.\"Lu Qing'er laughed. Batting her luscious lashes at him with interest, she waved him off with a dainty hand before turning away with her white parasol.Li Luo headed for the stage, where Yan Lingqing currently was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yan Lingqing was in one of them, currently arranging her things.She looked up when Li Luo walked in. \"You really can't get away from that girl no matter where you go.\"She had spotted him walking around with Lu Qing'er.\"Coincidence,\" Li Luo clarified.\"I think she's a little interested in you,\" Yan Lingqing said.\"No way! I won't let you sully our pure and platonic friendship!\" Li Luo objected.She coughed once dryly. \"Well, it's none of my business, but the girl has standards. Still, I wonder if you will be able to hold back the queens over at the Astral Sage College.\"\"It's getting out of hand now. Queens? Then what am I? A king?\" Li Luo countered.\"You wish.\"Yan Lingqing scoffed. She handed him a formula. \"This is the spirit liquid I'm going to refine. Familiarize yourself with it.\"Li Luo carefully read it. The fourth-grade spirit liquid was called Cyanobacteria. It was a rather difficult spirit liquid to get right, as fourth-grade liquids went. Evidently, Yan Lingqing was holding nothing back against Song Qiuyu.He scanned the list of ingredients and then inhaled sharply. There were more than 400 of them. Processing each one perfectly would be quite a test of one's refining skill.\"This is the formula for a fourth-grade spirit liquid? Incredible.\" Li Luo marveled. He could only refine second-grade spirit liquids for now, for which he had to handle at most 100 types of ingredients. That was nothing compared to a fourth-grade spirit liquid.Besides, the fusions between the fourth-grade ingredients were even more complicated. For second-grade ingredients, at most a fusion of two ingredients was required. But for fourth-grade ingredients, up to six ingredients needed to be fused. It was a huge leap in difficulty.Staff members were starting to deliver refining ingredients, and they were soon neatly piled up nearby. As the assistant, Li Luo went to inspect them.Yan Lingqing smiled approvingly at Li Luo's meticulousness.Time ticked on, and soon the various head resonance artificers of the villas in the Tianshu Province were all in their own refining workshops. Li Luo spotted Song Qiuyu entering the Pine Nut Villa's as well.The moment she stepped on stage, her eyes met Yan Lingqing's. Electricity sizzled between them.Yan Lingqing showed a blank face, but veins could be seen popping from her clenched fist.\"Why do I get the sense that you hate her a lot?\" Li Luo asked curiously. Yan Lingqing was one who rarely cared about anything besides spirit liquids and purifying lights. And yet she reacted strongly to Song Qiuyu.Yan Lingqing fell silent for a moment. \"We used to be on pretty good terms. I even forced a recommendation to get her into my teacher's refining group. But in one crucial competition, her error caused our group to lose. Our teacher was furious and kicked her out.\"That wouldn't be anything major, but later on she entered another refining group. Specifically, the one that beat us in the last competition because of her error.\"\"That's mean.\" Li Luo agreed.Yan Lingqing was silent. It was not hard to guess that Song Qiuyu had probably been bought out by that team.And as the one who had recommended Song Qiuyu, Yan Lingqing probably felt complicit in the betrayal and apologetic towards her teacher. No wonder it was hard for her to control her feelings around Song Qiuyu.She bent her head and continued arranging the ingredients.Li Luo did not press further, joining her until the bell rang. A loud cheer went up from the crowd.Staff entered the stage and announced the various resonance artificers and their villas.As their names were read, they were greeted by cheers from their supporters. All of them had made a name for themselves in the Tianshu Province.From the spectator stands, President Lu of the Golden Dragon Financial Group laughed as he looked over at the Suncreek Villa's refining platform. \"That Li Luo is really everywhere.\"Lu Qing'er smiled. \"He's a resonance artificer after all. He's here to gain experience.\"The lavishly-dressed President Lu turned to Lu Qing'er and probed cautiously. \"I say, Qing'er, haven't you been rather close to Li Luo recently?\"Lu Qing'er's eyes moved. \"So what?\" she replied calmly.President Lu chuckled nervously. \"Well, I just wanted to say that Li Luo is already an engaged man...\"Lu Qing'er looked at the handsome young man behind the crystal wall and was quiet for a beat. \"That engagement is only in name, isn't it?\"\"Who knows...\" President Lu wrung his hands.\"Second Uncle, you're imagining things. I'm not interested in Li Luo. But he helped me before, and saved me before. That made us close. You wouldn't deny me my friends, would you?\" Lu Qing'er demanded.\"No, no...\"President Lu quickly shook his head. He seemed relieved. \"Well, it's good that you're not interested. You're going to the Astral Sage College, and that's in Xia City. Your mother is there... And it's best to mention Li Luo as little as possible in front of her.\"Lu Qing'er's eyebrows went up. \"Why?\"President Lu chewed on the inside of his cheek for a while. \"It's baggage from the last generation, really. Best not to ask. Just... don't mention Li Luo in front of your mother.\"Lu Qing'er's eyes narrowed, but finally she nodded. For some reason, she suddenly felt irritated.Ding! Ding!The sound rang out with a sense of urgency this time, and it was clear that the competition was about to begin.The crowd yelled and cheered.Within their refining workshops, the resonance artificers squared their shoulders and prepared themselves.In the next moment, there was a flurry of water and light resonance power in each workshop, and the artificers started to prepare their ingredients.The competition had begun!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0084\u2013 The Fifth BorderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Frostriver Algae, half a strand.\"Panshan Vitality Roots, three.\"Qianxi water, three standard measurements.\"...\"Within the Suncreek Villa refining workshop, Yan Lingqing was issuing crisp, clear instructions, all of which Li Luo was swiftly following. He would measure out whatever she needed and hand it over.As Yan Lingqing picked up each crystal vial, she added water resonance power to crush the ingredients and release their special properties.There was no idle chit chat now, not during the competition. It was going to be a sprint from start to finish.However, Li Luo was picking up many things from the efficient way that Yan Lingqing was working. Her understanding of ingredient integration was superb.She deftly worked through the complex steps, and he knew that he would have ruined everything if it was left to him.She was indeed quite an expert in refining.But Li Luo also knew that this was just the start.Outside, there were commentators discussing the competition. Although those outside might not fully understand the processes, looking at the tense expressions of the resonance artificers helped them feel immersed in the situation. The tension was infectious.More and more crystal vials began to line up on Yan Lingqing's rack, twinkling with blue light. Their preparation was finished.Beads of sweat had started to appear on her beautiful face, but she did not even have time to wipe them. All her attention was concentrated on the vials in her hands. Her water resonance power worked nonstop, fusing yet more ingredients.The fusion of ingredients looked simple, but it required precise control of one's resonant power to remove the impurities from within them. One had to wield the resonant power for hundreds of passes before the required essence could be properly extracted.To the untrained eye, it looked like just a channeling of resonant power into the crystal vials, but there were invisible changes happening behind that image.A classic case of the experts watching the hustle and the laymen enjoying the bustle.This was a time for the resonance artificers with higher-grade resonances to distinguish themselves. A higher-grade resonance was easier to wield, and it could compensate for a lack of experience.Watching her beautiful face carefully, Li Luo hesitated for a moment. This time while arranging the ingredients, he flicked a finger and injected a dribble of waterlight resonance into it.\"Skyleaf Juice,\" Yan Lingqing said. Li Luo immediately handed it over to her.Yan Lingqing took it, imbuing her water resonance power and crushing it entirely. But this time, as the ingredients fused, her hands clenched tightly.She was shocked. This fusion had gone much more smoothly than before. When channeling her resonant power into the crystal vial, there seemed to be another special force inside making things effortless.However, this was a competition, so she had no time to examine it carefully. She could only quickly finish her work and move on to the next step.Li Luo was still carefully watching her expression. Seeing her not panicking was a relief. So his bit of resonant power had not interfered with the fusion. Perhaps it was helping.This was no surprise. After all, Li Luo's resonant power worked like a special watersource; it could accommodate other water and light resonances. His waterlight resonance was a sixth-grade one, but compared to single-element resonances, it was definitely comparable to a seventh-grade.Yan Lingqing's own water resonance was a lower seventh-grade. Therefore, Li Luo was technically stronger than her based on pure resonant power alone.However, because she was the main artificer, and Li Luo's power was a weak Ninth Seal's, his waterlight resonance had only helped to ease the situation.Besies, he knew that Yan Lingqing did not actually need his help for the Cyanobacteria spirit liquid. Therefore, his assistance had been just a testing of the waters.Time continued to pass under their frenzied and tense pacing.At this step, the refining was in its final phase. Li Luo breathed easy now. There had been no problems with her refining, and the fourth-grade Cyanobacteria spirit liquid had been completed.Ding!A bell rang out, and the voice of the judges could be heard.\"Greenlight Villa, Zhao Feng. Fourth-grade Greenlight purifying light, success. Tempering strength: 55%!\"\"Whitefang Villa, Liu Tong. Fourth-grade Whitefang spirit liquid, success. Tempering strength: 56%!\"As these were announced, Yan Lingqing did not seem fazed, calmly holding up her Cyanobacteria spirit liquid.However, her composure did not hold up for long, because a surprising announcement was made.\"Pine Nut Villa, Song Qiuyu. Fifth-grade Dainty spirit liquid, success! Tempering strength: 53%!\" \u00a0Wow!The entire arena broke out in an uproar. Many were looking at Song Qiuyu, who was holding up a vial with a smile on her face.Fifth-grade spirit liquid?!The Pine Nut Villa's Song Qiuyu had actually completed a fifth-grade spirit liquid?!Many of the other resonance artificers paled. They were virtually all fourth-grade resonance artificers. No one was a fifth-grade artificer, and yet Song Qiuyu had produced a fifth-grade spirit liquid? That would crush the competition!Whether this was a stroke of luck or otherwise, it had been produced in the competition, and it was rightfully her result.Song Shan and Mo Ling both grinned triumphantly.As for House Luolan's side, the flower fan in Cai Wei's hand faltered and her lovely goose egg-shaped face stiffened. She looked worriedly over at Yan Lingqing and Li Luo's refining workshop.The atmosphere was thick with tension.Yan Lingqing had been focused on her ingredients, and suddenly she froze as if petrified. The crystal vial in her hand did not move an inch.She stared at it, and the energy began to leak out of her.\"How could she have... a fifth-grade spirit liquid?\" Yan Lingqing stammered to herself.Peng!A slip of her resonant power, and the crystal vial shattered. The liquid dripped down her fingers. She placed both hands on the desk to steady herself. Her head was hung, her long hair covering her face entirely.There was no point in continuing now...Song Qiuyu had produced a fifth-grade spirit liquid. Even if her Cyanobacteria spirit liquid turned out to be a resounding success, it would still fall short.Li Luo looked at her, her resignation obvious. Through the strands of her hair, he could see that her eyes were watery.It was his first time seeing Yan Lingqing so vulnerable.Li Luo looked up at Song Qiuyu. She was gloating, her victory assured. Li Luo saw her looking over at Yan Lingqing with a superior sense of mockery.He was silent for a few moments, then he suddenly spun Yan Lingqing around. He stared into her watery eyes. \"Sister Lingqing,\" he said tersely, \"you are definitely better than Song Qiuyu. I don't know how she managed to refine a fifth-grade spirit liquid, but if she can do it, you can do too!\"Yan Lingqing shook her head. \"I've never succeeded, not even once,\" she whispered hoarsely.\"Perhaps not before, but perhaps you can do it now. We're already behind anyway. What's there to lose?\" Li Luo whispered back.He took her fair hand and wiped it dry with his clothing, encouraging her tenderly. \"Sister Lingqing, I don't really care about what victory or defeat here will do to the Suncreek Villa. I just think that you're an excellent artificer. How could you lose to her?\"She looked blankly at his chiseled features. Although still raw with youth, there was a strong will there that drummed up the courage in her.She bit her lip and gave him a small nod.\"Then... let's try.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'm most familiar with its formula, and it's the one I've been practicing. But like I said, I've never succeeded before,\" Yan Lingqing said.He nodded and called over the staff to tell them that they were going to change their refining materials. Very soon, a new batch of ingredients was streaming into the refining workshop.Song Qiuyu had already walked out of her own refining workshop with a superior smile. \"Yan Lingqing, still struggling? No way you can turn the tables,\" she gloated to herself. She was feeling very good about having decisively beaten Yan Lingqing.Back at the Resonance Tempering Hall, Yan Lingqing had always been firmly in the lead. Later on, Yan Lingqing had brought Song Qiuyu into the refining group, but that teacher had continued to favor Yan Lingqing and treat Song Qiuyu coldly.It had made her extremely resentful and jealous. She felt that her talent was comparable. The teacher's bias was unfair!Although Yan Lingqing was kind, it was a kindness that smacked of pity. She did not want it. Yan Lingqing, you were just trying to show off how nice you were!\"Now it is my win!\"...\"Ready.\"Li Luo looked over at Yan Lingqing.The latter took a deep breath and then nodded gravely.\"Glass solution, 10 drops!\"Li Luo immediately pulled out a transparent fruit and squeezed gently until 10 drops were in a test tube. He put a pulse of resonant power in.This one was slightly more than his experiment previously.He handed over the test tube, and she started to purify it and condense the medicinal properties.But this time, she could feel a strong and vital resonant power that was helping her tune things. She was taken aback by its presence.Most crucially, it was not at all hindering her processing. It was as though someone had secretly added a powerful watersource to it.And then a jolt of understanding flooded through her, making her turn to look at Li Luo anew.If she still did not understand at this point, then she would truly be a numbskull.She did not speak about it, quickly settling herself. With the help of that revitalizing resonant power, she swiftly began to purify the ingredients.\"Citric Drizzle Fruit.\"Cloud Rootgrass.\"Blossom Paste.\"The names tumbled off her tongue in quick succession, and Li Luo promptly supplied the ingredient each time.Time ticked on.The other resonance artificers were done. There were successes and failures, but none of it mattered. Before Song Qiuyu's fifth-grade spirit liquid, they were all defeated.Therefore, all eyes were now turned to the last refining workshop yet to finish\u2014Suncreek Villa.\"Not giving up yet?\"Mo Ling was smiling smugly up from the Song family's viewing area. He shook his head. \"Yan Lingqing, struggling like a fish on the hook. Does she think she can produce a fifth-grade spirit liquid too?\"\"Impossible. She's not at the fifth-grade level yet. Even Qiuyu could not have done it if not for the secret Inkwater ingredients.\"Song Shan gave a calculated smile. \"The moment Qiuyu is declared Artificer Prime, we will announce the launch of the Inkwater Villa's products. It will definitely cause a huge stir, and the Suncreek Villa can basically pack up and close.\"Song Shan's heartbeat quickened as he imagined the moment.After today, the Pine Nut Villa would be the best villa in the Tianshu Province.At the Golden Dragon Bank's spectator area, President Lu frowned. \"There must be some trouble at the Suncreek Villa side. The Song family is working together with the Inkwater Villa. They delivered huge quantities of their secret formulas before. They must be aiming to crush the Suncreek Villa today.\"Lu Qing'er was alarmed to hear this. The Song family must have been planning to make their move at this festival.Their goal? To surpass the Suncreek Villa and dominate the spirit liquids and purifying lights market in the Tianshu Province.Over at House Luolan's side, Cai Wei felt a tingle of excitement upon seeing Yan Lingqing rally herself. She knew of the grudge between the two. If she lost here, it would be a big mental blow.Still, she was very anxious. She did not understand how Yan Lingqing could possibly turn this around.Soon enough, another bell rang out, reminding participants that the time limit was approaching.Song Qiuyu folded her arms across her chest, resting her head against the crystal wall at an angle. She cocked an eye towards a fully-focused Yan Lingqing, watching her struggle with pleasure.\"Yan Lingqing, how helpless! It will not save you,\" she hissed.Ding!Another bell.Yan Lingqing put down her hands. Her face was pouring with fragrant sweat, her chin tucked in. Close to 1,000 ingredients had been prepared, and the toil on her had been incredible.However, the preparations were all done.It had gone much more smoothly than she had ever done before.But the final step was to refine the watersource and then fuse all of the prepared mixtures together to form the final spirit liquid.It was an equally important step.Yan Lingqing took a deep breath and picked up a polymerization crystal.Li Luo put his hand on hers.Yan Lingqing looked at him, puzzled. If not for the gravity of the situation, she would have thought he was hitting on her.\"Sister Lingqing, let's do this together.\" Li Luo gave her a sunny smile that dazzled her for a moment.Recovering, she nodded. Although she did not really understand what he was doing, she trusted him.Both used their resonant powers together, infusing the polymerization crystal.A pure light settled within the crystal. Next, droplets of watersource began to condense and drip down into a crystal vial.Li Luo's face was pale. He had used up virtually all of his resonant power. Although he was much weaker than she was, the purity of the watersource that he could produce was a cut above Yan Lingqing's.With the two working together, the result would have to be better than a watersource that Yan Lingqing produced alone.Holding the vial up, Yan Lingqing looked at the purest watersource she had ever produced.It was all thanks to Li Luo.She again turned to stare at him, and he grinned at her weakly, his face pale.\"Sister Lingqing, the show's yours.\"With a slight incline of her head in acknowledgement, she started to bring the ingredients together, adding test tubes to the bottle of watersource.When they injected the watersource, the test tube solutions glowed, filled with lifeforms fusing together and creating new possibilities.The changes would take the better part of a minute before subsiding.Within the crystal vial, the liquid bubbled and quietened, and its color gradually faded away. At the same time, beams of light danced merrily within.\u201cHua!\u201dThe crowd was getting excited now. The resonance artificers were even more astonished. From the dancing lights, they could tell that this was more than a fourth-grade spirit liquid. It had to be a fifth-grade spirit liquid!Yan Lingqing stared at the crystal vial, lost in thought. Finally, she stretched out a trembling hand and inserted the tempering measurement needle.It climbed to 58!Her eyes lit up like the sun.The crowd roared, led by the commentator.\"Suncreek Villa! Yan Lingqing! Fifth-grade Heavenward spirit liquid, SUCCESS! Tempering strength, FIFTTTYYYY EIGHT!\"ROAR!After a stunned silence, the crowd exploded with excitement. The Suncreek Villa had barely finished in time, but they had managed to produce a fifth-grade spirit liquid!And it was even higher than Song Qiuyu's!Incredible!Amidst the cheers, the smirk on Song Qiuyu's face was frozen in time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A comeback at the last moment by Suncreek Villa's Yan Lingqing. She too had made a 5th-grade spirit liquid!\"WHAT!\" Song Shan and Mo Ling thundered, springing out of their chairs aghast. They were completely incredulous.\"Impossible! IMPOSSIBLE! There must be a trick!\" Mo Ling snarled. Yan Lingqing was clearly only a 4th-grade resonance artificer. How could she have made a 5th-grade spirit liquid?Anger clouded Song Shan's face, brewing like a storm.The sudden turn of events had devastated his perfect plan. It was foiled completely.Over at the Golden Dragon Bank side, President Lu's eyes were round as saucers as well. He rubbed his portly chin. \"Too much of a coincidence, isn't it? When did Yan Lingqing become capable of refining 5th-grade spirit liquids too?\"\"If Song Qiuyu can do it, why can't she?\" Lu Qing'er laughed with relief.President Lu fumbled for an answer. \"Well normally speaking, neither should be able to. But both HAVE been able to. Could it be luck?\"\"Who knows.\" Lu Qing'er said indifferently. All that mattered was that Suncreek Villa had won. Li Luo would be happy now.President Lu looked at her and shook his head.However, he too was happy that Suncreek Villa had won. After all, Song Yunfeng had betrayed Lu Qing'er during the exams, and he wasn't happy about it at all. He had dealt business with them with a grudging manner since. If not for the fact that she had turned out safe, he would not have let the matter rest so easily.Over at House Luolan's side, Cai Wei sank down in relief. Her hand was thumping her chest repeatedly, trying to calm herself down. \"How did Lingqing do it? Was she inspired by the young lord's good looks? But she's not that kind of superficial girl?\"Yan Lingqing was not like her. She didn't care about a person's looks at all. Still, who cared because Suncreek Villa had gotten the ideal result.\"Impossible!\"\"How could she have created a 5th-grade with a higher tempering strength than me?!\" Song Qiuyu was completely floored. When she recovered, she immediately objected.Her attractive features were twisted in spite now.\"There must be a trick!\" She yelled at the judge.He ignored her. His only responsibility was to judge the outcome. After confirming that Yan Lingqing's product was indeed a 5th-grade spirit liquid with a 58% tempering strength, he immediately announced the winner. \"Suncreek Villa's Yan Lingqing, no mistakes in tempering. 5th-grade spirit liquid, tempering strength 58%, first place!\"\"I declare Suncreek Villa's Yan Lingqing the winner!\"Whao!Loud gasps and cheers filled the arena after the decision. This was a spectacular comeback.\"Wow, we won!\"In the refining workshop, Yan Lingqing was stunned. Joy lit up her beautiful features, and she turned to hug Li Luo, cheering and jumping.Li Luo hurriedly raised his hands, declaring his innocence. But feeling her slim, fragrant body pressed against him was a unique feeling that curvier bodies just could not give him.She quickly got her emotions under control, a slight tinge of embarrassment in her eyes.\"That's not my fault though!\" Li Luo protested his innocence. What an unreasonable woman. She had jumped him, and now she was angry?Yan Lingqing sniffed, then waved a joking fist at him. She could not hide her overflowing joy at having made the comeback.\"Congratulations, you're the Tianshu Province's Artificer Prime,\" Li Luo said brightly.She rolled her eyes at him. The title was worth exactly zero gold. She didn't really care about it. What mattered more was getting a win over her long-time rival, Song Qiuyu.\"It's not like you don't know how I won... But with this success, I feel like perhaps truly becoming a fifth-grade resonance artificer is not far away now.\" She gushed.\"Impressive.\" Li Luo gave her a thumbs up. If she could become a fifth-grade artificer, then she would truly be a respectable expert in the field on a wider scale.She turned to regard him with her gorgeous eyes. She knew that he was essential to the win, and that was still a source of puzzlement for her. He was clearly only a second-grade artificer. His water resonance did not seem to have that high of a grade either. But the water resonance he had produced was brimming with vitality, even stronger than hers.Li Luo was clearly hiding some secrets.Still, she had the presence of mind not to ask it here. She was not an overly nosy person. Since he was not volunteering information, she wasn't going to pursue the issue.She set this matter aside for now.With the refining complete, Yan Lingqing and Li Luo walked out of the refining workshop. She looked over at the spiteful Song Qiuyu and said coolly, \"Sorry to deny you the win.\"Song Qiuyu snapped, \"Yan Lingqing, I don't believe you can refine a fifth-grade spirit liquid!\"\"I don't believe you can either,\" Yan Lingqing retorted. \"If you have doubts, we can go get the results verified. See if we used any little tricks in our work.\"This competition was just a part of the festival. It was not particularly major, and so many of the rules were a little iffy. But if Song Qiuyu truly wanted to push the issue, they could get the results verified by professionals.Still, it was as she had said. She did not believe that Song Qiuyu could make a fifth-grade spirit liquid, because she understood her ability well. She must have pulled off something dirty.Song Qiuyu bit her lip so hard that it left a bloody line. In the end, she did not dare to pursue the issue. She was unsure. Mo Ling had sworn that the Mo family's secrets could not be detected, but she did not dare risk it.They had already lost.Besides, the title of Artificer Prime would've just been the appetizer to their plan. Although it might not have gone as smoothly as they hoped, it did not actually affect their subsequent operations.She turned a hateful eye on Yan Lingqing. \"You think you've won? Dream on!\" She swallowed her anger and turned to the crowd. In a clear voice, she declared, \"Everyone, the Song family has big news to announce. From today onwards, the Song family will be working together with the Inkwater Villa to produce a new line of spirit liquids and purifying lights.\"First-grade Blackstar spirit liquid, 62%.\"Second-grade Blackmoon spirit liquid, 61%.\"Third-grade Blackglory purifying light, 60%.\"This was greeted with astonishment and excitement from those present. The famous Inkwater Villa was, of course, a name that many in the Tianshu recognized. This was great news for the average consumer. Higher quality at the same price? Who would pass it up?Presently, the best choices were the first-grade Azure Jade spirit liquid and the second-grade Ruby Slush spirit liquid from the Suncreek Villa. Both were about 60%. It seemed like the Song family's newest line would surpass that!They now saw that this was the bigger goal of the Song family today.The championship fight was merely a boost to their reputation.Even though they had lost the title, the new line of products had quality that would speak for itself. The momentum was with the Song family now. It truly did not matter where the title went. The true winners here were the buyers.Yan Lingqing's heart sank when she heard the news. So that could not be denied.How would they deal with the Song family's move?Yan Lingqing helplessly turned to Li Luo, but she found him with a cheerful grin on his face.Somehow, it made her heartstrings tighten, then she felt the tension evaporate from her body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Song family's move had huge implications. Working together with the Inkwater Villa? The Inkwater Villa was famous throughout Xia. In terms of expertise and scale, they were far beyond any villa in the Tianshu Province.It was like releasing a tiger into the sheep flock.One could only imagine that most of the spirit liquids and purifying lights market would now fall into the Song family's hands. And the Suncreek Villa would fall just as quickly as they had risen.Song Qiuyu's expression eased up. She looked loftily at Yan Lingqing. \"You might have won the competition, but the Song family has beaten the Suncreek Villa.\"However, bright laughter erupted from a nearby Li Luo. She looked over at him. \"Is that amusing to you?\"Li Luo nodded, but didn't reply. Instead he turned to the crowd. \"Everyone, the Suncreek Villa also has an announcement to make. From today onwards, we will upgrade our first-grade Azure Jade and second-grade Ruby Slush spirit liquids. By my calculations, the new spirit liquids will probably have a tempering strength of 64%\"Wow!This announcement gobsmacked the entire crowd. Even the other resonance artificers stared at Li Luo, open-mouthed.64% for first and second-grade spirit liquids?If that could be mass-produced, it would be a quality that would rank in the top 10 even in the whole Xia Kingdom.The other top 10 products were all the result of countless experiments and trials by the huge powers. These groups had invested a lot of time and effort to stabilize their formulas.And now the Suncreek Villa was saying they could achieve it?\"You're talking out your ass, boy!\" Mo Ling shouted from the Song family spectator stands. Li Luo's mouth was too big. How dare he have the cheek to say he could reach 64% with the Azure Jade and the Ruby Slush? That was a tall order even for the Inkwater Villa.Song Shan looked as though he had swallowed something slimy. He wanted to dismiss Li Luo's words as nonsense, and yet there was a slight unease he could not shake off. This Li Luo was always an enigma.Over at the Golden Dragon side, President Lu turned to Lu Qing'er in surprise. \"Another upgrade to the Suncreek Villa's spirit liquids? So soon?\"She blinked back at him innocently, indicating that she did not know.Song Qiuyu was equally stunned at the announcement. \"What are you blabbing about? Not even the headquarters of your Suncreek Villa could achieve that. You? A small branch? What do you think spirit liquids and purifying lights are, kid? You think they'll leap and dance at your command? Other major villas have gone through countless trials and experiments and done a ton of research to gain experience. Only then could they inch up their quality by a fraction.\u201dThe Suncreek Villa's spirit liquids and purifying lights could barely touch the fifties a mere two months ago. They had barely been able to hold ground against other villas in the Tianshu Province, let alone compete against the Pine Nut Villa.They had suddenly managed to muster a drastic improvement, but surely they couldn't pull it off a second time so soon, right?Yan Lingqing remained silent. There was doubt in her eyes. She did not know if even she could do it.But after what had just happened, her confidence in Li Luo had deepened significantly. And since he had dared to announce this publicly, he had to be prepared.Li Luo waved to someone behind him and immediately a servant of House Luolan hurried forward with a black box. He opened the box to reveal dozens of spirit liquids and purifying lights within. They were Ruby Slush and Azure Jade from the Suncreek Villa.Li Luo took one out casually and then tested it. To everyone's shock, the tempering strength was actually at 64%.The crowd went wild.Still beaming, Li Luo continued, \"From today onwards, both Azure Jade and Ruby Slush will be at 64%. If any fall below that, the Suncreek Villa guarantees a full refund. No questions asked.\"It was a bold declaration that made his commitment clear.Song Qiuyu's sour face was back. She wanted to accuse Li Luo of hiring expert artificers to produce them, but with that proclamation, it signified that he was confident in producing them long-term, and ensuring quality.She shook with rage and frustration.She had worked so hard for today to be successful. She had snared the Inkwater Villa and engineered the alliance, all in order to destroy Yan Lingqing and the Suncreek Villa. And now it was all in the water.She had lost to Yan Lingqing, and now their new products had been soundly beaten by the Suncreek Villa as well.They were well and truly a laughing stock.\"No way! No way!!\" Mo Ling howled, having broken down completely.He refused to believe that the Suncreek Villa could produce such quality liquids and lights in the long term.\"Li Luo must be lying!\"Song Shan stood up, his face expressionless. Ignoring the raving Mo Ling, he turned and left.There was nothing that could be changed about today's outcome. The Song family's moves had all been easily swept aside and negated. No, they had been turned fully to their opponent's advantage.64% tempering strength. It would forever be a mountain that crushed the Song family. There was no coming back from this one.Again, the Song family had been crushed and rolled over.He remembered that it was not always this way. Before, the Song family had devoured all of House Luolan's assets in the Tianshu Province. They were flying high. How had it become like this?In his mind's eye, Li Luo's face appeared.Everyone knew that House Luolan's Jiang Qing'e was to be envied. But had they been sleeping on this young lord? Still waters run deep, but he struck with the deadliness and unexpectedness of a viper.\"Let's go. Show's over.\"President Lu stood up as well, smiling at Lu Qing'er. \"Although I don't have much proof, my years of business instinct is telling me that the Young Lord is something special.\"He might not have the same sharpness that his parents and Jiang Qing'e have, but he knows how to pick his moments. That is a strength uncommon for those his age. I think he will be a match for Jiang Qing'e in the future.\"He turned to leave.Lu Qing'er tilted her head to look at Li Luo and smiled faintly as well. \"I think so too,\" she said softly.Thinking about how they would soon head to the Astral Sage College together to begin a new chapter of their lives, she felt an inexplicable tingle of anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But in order to keep your relationship with Sister Qing'e intact, I suggest you control yourselves. If you can't, I suggest you discuss this with her,\" Li Luo sincerely warned them after the staring was getting out of hand.\"Tsk.\"They both tsked him. This guy was getting bolder by the day.\"Young Lord, you're a man of many secrets indeed. But it's time to spill. How are we going to maintain 64% strength in the future?\" Cai Wei asked.\"Easy. I've improved the watersource's purity. So the tempering strength has increased accordingly.\"Both were speechless. Yan Lingqing had guessed at least that much. After all, the only factor in spirit liquid quality that Li Luo could influence was the watersource.Still, even Yan Lingqing was amazed by how much he had purified the watersource before. Had he managed to do so again?\"The Songs went to great lengths to secure all that external aid. They must have gone through an endless series of negotiations and talks. After all that, they lost to a simple watersource purification... I almost feel sorry for Song Qiuyu now.\" Cai Wei shook her head, smiling.Li Luo matched her smile. Luckily, the Suncreek Villa had not yet pushed out any third-grade spirit liquids. As a Ninth Seal, he was not strong enough to output so much watersource. Otherwise, he would have raised it as well and totally shut the Songs out of the market.\"But you're heading to the Astral Sage College soon, right? What will we do about the watersource then?\" Yan Lingqing asked suddenly.It went without saying that the Suncreek Villa's spirit liquids were only where they were thanks to Li Luo. When the enabler left, how could they ensure quality?He had already guaranteed refunds for anything less than 64%.Li Luo had already thought of this. \"When I go to Xia City, I'll send back a batch of watersource every month to ensure quality.\"And as Li Luo's resonant power rose, the amount of watersource he could produce would increase as well. It should be able to meet the needs back here at the Tianshu Province.Both women nodded in approval.\"But if you go to Xia City, Lingqing and I should go with you,\" Cai Wei said. \"After all, I came to the Tianshu Province to stabilize the businesses here. I've finished all of my tasks. I should be returning to Xia City as well.\"Yan Lingqing nodded as well. \"The Suncreek Villa is doing well. The other day, headquarters sent over a fourth-grade resonance artificer as the vice-president, appointed by Jiang Qing'e. He must be trustworthy; I can leave matters here to him.\"She gave him a sly smile. \"Actually I'm still a student at the Astral Sage College. When you get in, you will have to call me 'senior sister.'\"\"Indeed, it would be a waste for talents like yourselves to remain at the Tianshu Province.\" Li Luo replied with a laugh.Cai Wei was the administrator of House Luolan. Because of their troubles here, Jiang Qing'e had sent Cai Wei to hold down the fort at the Tianshu Province. As for Yan Lingqing, she was a gifted student at the Resonance Tempering Hall in the Astral Sage College. She had agreed to come to the Tianshu Province at the behest of Jiang Qing'e mainly to improve her skills.Now that he was leaving the Tianshu Province, the two of them would not linger either.\"When do you plan to move?\" Cai Wei asked.\"I probably need another half a month or so,\" Li Luo replied.There was still a little over a month left in his holidays. And he needed to fill as many holes on the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Wheel as he could, to build his second acquired resonance.\"Just about right, timewise. We'll make arrangements, tie things down, and be ready to leave around that time as well,\" Cai Wei said cheerfully.\"I haven't seen my babe Qing'e in a while now. I miss her,\" Yan Lingqing said eagerly.Li Luo nodded emphatically. \"I miss my babe Qing'e too. I wish I could give her a big, lovey-dovey hug.\"Yan Lingqing suddenly turned serious. \"I suggest you be more circumspect at the Astral Sage College. If you really make a move, I suspect you will be clubbed to death.\"Li Luo started. \"Is it illegal to hug my fiance?\" He grumbled. \"Are the Astral Sage College people so barbaric?\"Yan Lingqing rolled her eyes at him.......The days after the festival passed peacefully, reverting to a state of calm.The Suncreek Villa was doing better and better by the day, steadily dominating the spirit liquids and purifying lights market. This was the highest annual profit that they had ever turned.When there were just two weeks left until the end of the holidays, Li Luo's resonant power finally managed to reach the threshold, and he broke into the Tenth Seal.At this level, it was time to prepare for the next step, the Resonant Master Stage, and consolidate his resonance seed. Still, it was going to take time. As for his Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Wheel, Li Luo had worked on it steadily, and now only two holes were left.Still, these two holes eluded his every attempt. He could not find suitable ingredients that the wheel would accept. His guess was that the wood and earth elements in the ingredients were insufficient.Which meant that these last two holes needed to be filled with something really rare.He had specially gone to visit the Golden Dragon Bank, but the ingredients there did not meet his standards either. Finally, President Lu mentioned that if he wanted even better ingredients, he would probably have to visit the Golden Dragon Bank's headquarters in Xia City.There, he would probably find something that would meet his needs.With that, Li Luo took it as a sign that it was really time to leave for a bigger pond.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For as long as he could remember, most of his life had been spent here. And now he was leaving.He let those memories play through his mind now. Finally, he turned and lifted the curtain, entering the carriage.\"Let's go.\"At his order, the convoy started to move. The road to Xia City was a long one. Even at full speed, they would take close to ten days. And since Li Luo was the young lord of House Luolan, safety was a priority. He had brought many bodyguards with him.The convoy thundered on, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake.Although they were moving swiftly, the wide, spacious carriage was quite stable. Li Luo sat cross-legged on one side. Opposite him, Cai Wei was sitting with one leg elegantly draped over the other, reading a book with great interest.Deep in the carriage, there was a little space where Yan Lingqing was currently working on her spirit liquids and purifying lights to kill time.The two women were accompanying him to Xia City, having completed the tasks that they had set out to do in the Tianshu Province.\"Sister Cai Wei, how is House Luolan looking right now?\" Li Luo suddenly asked, turning from the scenery flying by.She lifted her eyes from her book and considered his question. \"Not too good. You should know that House Luolan has tempted many. It has many lucrative businesses all over the Xia Kingdom. Each year it turns millions of skygold in profits. It's enough to turn any eye.\"And now House Luolan is besieged with problems inside and outside. Its invited vultures, swooping around. If not for the remnants of House Luolan's strength and the potential that Jiang Qing'e demonstrates, I'm sure someone would have made a move on House Luolan long ago.\"Li Luo was silent for a while and then shook his head. \"If there was truly a power eying House Luolan, those paltry deterrences would not be enough.\"Jiang Qing'e indeed had shocking potential, but potential was not strength. Besides, if not for the fact that she was protected by her status as an Astral Sage College student, there would probably be many who would attempt to kill her off.Cai Wei looked at him with surprise. \"What are you thinking?\"Li Luo responded slowly, \"I think it's the threat of my parents\u2026 Or rather those powers cannot be sure that my parents are truly gone. They are worried that if they overstep, one day my parents will return... and they won't be able to save themselves.\"The wrath of two Duke Stage experts was enough to give anyone pause here in the Xia Kingdom.Cai Wei thought it over, then nodded in agreement. \"The Young Lord's thinking is sound.\"\"Still, this threat will only weaken as time passes. We are fat cattle, too tempting for the hungry tigers.\" Li Luo sighed softly.Even he did not know how long the threat of Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan could hold the scavengers at bay. Perhaps one day, any day, those other houses would gain intelligence confirming things, then it would only be a matter of time before House Loulan was finished off.When would that time be?Li Luo scowled. Very likely, next year's House Luolan Housemeet. Pei Hao would be the first to cause trouble and incite damaging moves against House Luolan.Which meant that time was of the essence. He was but a Tenth Seal kid. These enemies were savage tigers and wolves. How he wished he had a few more years!In a few years, he and Jiang Qing'e would both be at the Duke stage. At that time, they would rule this place!Li Luo sighed deeply. Unfortunately, those people were not going to give him that much time.\"How are the elite powers in the Xia Kingdom treating House Luolan? On the surface,\" Li Luo asked.\"If you take away the Astral Sage College and the Golden Dragon Bank because of their unusual positions, the Xia Kingdom's royal court is the strongest among the elite powers. Although in recent years, the royal court has been in turmoil. The ruler is young, and a steward is governing in lieu. Below the royal court, there are various illustrious houses and the five Great Houses.\"Among the five Great Houses, Houses Duze and Jiyan have the strongest enmity with House Luolan. House Lanling sits neutral, while House Jinque has passable relations with us. Or rather... they have plans to use House Luolan to chip away at the other stronger houses,\" Cai Wei explained.\"These factions all have their headquarters in Xia City. While you were at the City of Southwind, you might not have felt affected. But once you step into Xia City, I'm afraid trouble will always be knocking at the door.\"Li Luo nodded. He was prepared. Although Jiang Qing'e was handling matters on behalf of House Luolan, ultimately he was the rightful owner.He had been left unmolested at the City of Southwind, ensconced away from the politics. Plus, his blank palaces meant that they had all ignored him as an invalid.But now he was one step closer to the whirlwind of politics. It was unavoidable.Still, this was his responsibility as the young lord. He could not leave Jiang Qing'e to shoulder all the burden. He might have been helpless and unqualified before, but now he had his own strength, and it was his duty to lend it.\"Understood...\"Li Luo nodded thoughtfully. \"My parents really left behind a mess, huh.\"They were in a mess partly because he was not strong enough. He had to grow stronger, as quickly as possible. And in the Xia Kingdom, there was no better place for that than the Astral Sage College.Therefore, he was very happy to have secured admission there....The trip was not at all tedious, not with beauties to accompany him. It passed in leisurely fashion.A few days passed in the blink of an eye.Their convoy had reached the capital of the Xia Kingdom.Li Luo stood on the carriage, looking far ahead. He could see the silhouette of a large metropolitan area. It was still some distance away, but already he could see how intimidating it was.It took one's breath away.The City of Southwind was not even a fraction of this.\"Well, as expected of the capital,\" Li Luo said.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing were smiling with pleasure. They were finally back.\"That was a smooth journey. Better than I expected,\" he said to them.But just as he spoke, they spotted some people on a high slope nearby. They were raising a banner hurriedly.Li Luo could see a golden sparrow on the flag, wings outstretched. It glittered in the sun.\"Is that House Jinque?\" Cai Wei asked, surprised.Li Luo was surprised too. He had made no effort to keep move to Xia City a secret, so it was not difficult for others to find out. He had imagined that his first encounter would be with unfriendly forces trying to stop or toy with him. However, he didn't expect it to be with House Jinque, who was supposedly on decent terms with House Loulan, who had made first contact.What did they want?The question was answered soon enough. A messenger galloped over on a crimson horse-like creature, announcing loudly as he came, \"The young mistress of my house invites the young lord of House Luolan to meet.\"\"The young mistress of House Jinque?\"Li Luo looked over at Cai Wei. \"The young mistress is called Si Qiuying. She's the same age as you. She should be heading to the Astral Sage College as well,\" she answered. \"I guess you two haven't met before?\"Li Luo pondered this. \"Perhaps another one infatuated by my dashing looks?\"The two women rolled their eyes.Li Luo chuckled. \"Overthinking helps no one. I'll know when I meet her.\"He leaped out of the carriage, landing lightly on the back of a sturdy crimson beast.\"No need for bodyguards?\" Cai Wei called.Li Luo waved her off. No one would be foolish enough to actually do anything to him in Xia City. No matter how much House Luolan had fallen, it still had some power.The red creature brayed and then galloped back up the steep slope.At the top of the slope, expensive fur rugs had been laid out on the grass. On it was a long table, behind which a green-haired girl sat in a kneeling position, her quiet eyes watching Li Luo's approach.1. Jinque literally means golden sparrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was kneeling behind the long table, her legs bare.Her eyebrows were artfully drawn, an artist's touch on porcelain skin. Her silky, green hair cascaded down and swayed in the breeze. She was indeed quite a beauty.Li Luo followed her lead, kneeling at the long table. He threw a smile her way. \"Si Qiuying?\"\"Li Luo?\" She smiled back, her voice lilting as a nightingale's call.He nodded. \"I guess I recognized you right.\"\"In terms of looks, you've perfectly inherited the best of the two House Lords,\" she said lightly.\"Reading between the lines, it means I've not inherited much else?\" Li Luo countered.\"I didn't say that. Not to the face of the champion of the Tianshu Province's exams.\" She smiled.\"Are you from Xia Academy?\" Li Luo asked.Like Southwind Academy, Xia Academy was also a high school-level institution. However, it was much more famous, being in Xia City itself.She gave a graceful nod. \"However, just second place.\"\"Impressive, from a school in the top 3.\" Li Luo praised her. Although she had not revealed her resonant power, he could sense that she was probably at the Resonant Master stage.Through their short exchange, Li Luo was starting to build an impression of her. Warm on the exterior, and a cool pride running deep in her bones. Still, that was understandable for the young mistress of House Jinque. Plus, they were much more powerful than House Luolan currently was.\"Miss Si, you wouldn't be here to welcome me, would you? I don't think the likes of me would justify such respect,\" Li Luo suddenly stated.Si Qiuying did not immediately reply. Instead, she pointed a slim finger towards Xia City. \"There are people from Xia Academy intending to give you trouble today. The one behind this is Duze Beixuan.\"Li Luo was taken aback. \"I haven't even offended him before.\"\"House Duze has been at odds with House Luolan for a long time,\" she said wryly. \"He dares not make trouble for Sister Qing'e, so he can only turn on you.\"\"Well, thanks for that.\" He nodded, cupping his hands in respect towards her.She eyed him. \"Li Luo, you do know the position House Luolan is in, dont you?\"He sighed. \"Spit it out please. All this prevarication is tiring. You're not even that old, there's no need to speak like you're all old and stuffy.\"Her brows drew together slightly. \"I'm asking you if you want to protect House Luolan,\" she said sternly.\"Well, of course. But I'm hounded by wolves on all sides. It's not going to be easy,\" he replied.\"I have a method that can protect House Luolan,\" she said serenely.Not waiting for his response, she pressed on. \"An alliance by marriage between House Luolan and House Jinque. Together, we will be a force to be feared.\"Li Luo started, eying her with hesitation. \"Eh, sorry. I'm already engaged. I can't get engaged to you.\"Now it was Si Qiuying whose composure slipped. \"I didn't mean you and ME!\" she snapped at him, her pale skin flushing slightly.\"I meant my elder brother and Sister Qing'e!\"\"Well, that's even more out of the question,\" Li Luo said apologetically.Si Qiuying glared at him. \"Li Luo, don't play the fool with me. You know the implications of what I propose. If you want to protect House Luolan, you need to pay a price. If you are willing to initiate the cancellation of the engagement with Sister Qing'e, and consent to the marriage between my brother and her, then we will all be a family. We will stick together and protect House Luolan to the end.\"\"Is this your will? Or do you speak for House Jinque?\" he asked.\"As long as you agree, it is House Jinque's will. A marriage between my brother and Sister Qing'e will bring many benefits and little harm,\" she replied.\"Well, in that case I don't agree.\"She stared at him with irritation. \"Are you giving up on House Luolan?\"\"Of course I want to protect House Luolan. But I also want the person in question.\" He grinned.\"You are too greedy. Greedy people never end up well, and the friendship of House Jinque is not extended to avaricious people,\" she said coldly.He shook his head and smiled. \"Miss Si, you are naive. Do you think this is friendship? Between factions, there is only the weighing of benefits.\"\"House Jinque and House Luolan are still friendly. Do you think this is some fairy-tale friendship? Wrong. House Jinque is simply worried that House Luolan will fall too fast and feed the other houses. Even in its miserable state, House Luolan can still take the burden off House Jinque.\"\"So, Miss Si, if you are representing House Jinque, then do not speak to me of friendship.\"House Luolan may look to be on shaky ground, but still it stands. And not because of any friendship with House Jinque. If you still do not understand, go ask your parents. I am in no mood to educate the illiterate.\"He had spoken in a neutral tone, but there was an undertone of abrasiveness intended to anger Si Qiuying.\"Pa!\"Her small hands slammed the table, and her resonant power pulsed forth.He looked at her mildly. \"Miss Si's behavior has not left me with a good first impression of House Jinque.\"\"Li Luo, you go too far!\" she hissed.\"Best take a look at yourself first,\" Li Luo said calmly. \"I might be from the City of Southwind, but you can't just treat me like an ignorant bumpkin.\"\"I was just giving you a suggestion,\" she said coolly.Li Luo rose. \"I have never thought that House Luolan needed to rely on others, because I know no one can be trusted. Anyone who wishes to target House Luolan will have to go through me.\"\"I guess I'll ask Sister Qing'e,\" Si Qiuying said coldly.\"Oh yes, they would have to go through my fiance as well.\"She stared at him angrily. \"You talk a lot. If not for Sister Qing'e, House Luolan would have been plundered long ago.\"\"Which backs my point. A reliable fiance is a wonderful thing, isn't it?\"The gnashing of her teeth was clearly audible now. She took a few deep breaths, realizing that she had underestimated Li Luo's brazenness. He didn't seem to feel embarrassed in the presence of women. Instead, he seemed to relish it.Li Luo ignored her. He looked far across the land and saw another group. One among them bore a banner with House Luolan's emblem.Leading them, Li Luo could spot a beautiful and familiar figure.He whistled to them, then cocked his head back for another brutal parting shot.\"Oh look, my fiance is here to pick me up.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her long, white legs and gorgeous body were enough to bring the dead back to life.The perfect heroine.She turned her deep, gold eyes to Li Luo and then to Si Qiuying. \"Little earthworm, are you interested in my Young Lord? Courting him aggressively?\" she asked mildly.Si Qiuying forced a nervous laugh and pleaded, \"I just wanted to see the champion of the Tianshu exams in the flesh.\"Jiang Qing'e turned to Li Luo. \"Is that so?\"Si Qiuying desperately shot Li Luo looks.\"Miss Si over here asked me to cancel our engagement. She wants to start a new one between you and her brother.\"Little girl, how naive! You should have asked Southwind Academy what Li Luo was famous for. It was tattling!Si Qiuying's smile froze on her face, but her eyes were burning holes into Li Luo.Jiang Qing'e's face did not change one bit. \"Little earthworm, are you trying to burrow out of the ground? You dare worm into my business?\"Si Qiuying shrank away. \"No, please let me explain, Sister Qing'e,\" she said in a small voice.She ran away.Jiang Qing'e flicked a finger and sent a pellet of light whistling out. It smacked against Si Qiuying's shoulder with a tiny ring.\u201cUuuuu!\u201dSi Qiuying cried, clutching her arm. She turned to Jiang Qing'e, beseeching tearfully. \"Sister Qing'e, I was in the wrong! Please don't hit me anymore.\"Jiang Qing'e dispelled the light resonance. \"I won't do it again.\"Also, stop trying to tie me up with your brother. He might be excellent, but he's not my cup of tea.\"Si Qiuying was sulky. \"Sister Qing'e, my big brother is quite the catch. Even the Astral Sage College mentors say that he has the makings of a Duke!\"\"Duke?\"Jiang Qing'e scoffed. \"That's it?\"Si Qiuying balked. Those words from anyone else would be bragging, but from Jiang Qing'e?She bit her lip and then looked across at Li Luo, who was enjoying the show. \"Maybe he can't compare to Sister Qing'e, but he's definitely better than that one.\"Jiang Qing'e smiled. \"Maybe not... two months ago, Li Luo had blank palaces. Now he's first in the Tianshu Province. Give him some time, and he might just top the Astral Sage College's newcomers.\"\"Sister Qing'e, your imagination has to have a limit,\" Si Qiuying said scathingly.Although Li Luo's improvements in a mere two months could not be denied, him becoming the best in the new cohort was quite impossible. This was the Astral Sage College! The cream of the Xia Kingdom crop, all gathered in one place. What was Li Luo worth in this group!?Jiang Qing'e turned away, dismissing her with a flick of her hand.Si Qiuying had no choice but to get up and put on her shoes. Throwing one last angry look at Li Luo, she turned to leave.Only after Si Qiuying had slunk off with her retinue did Li Luo speak. \"That was harsh. I've just arrived and you've heaped resentment on my plate.\"Once Jiang Qing'e's words got out, Li Luo felt that it was going to complicate his life at the Astral Sage College by a big notch.\"I think you might be angry at me, but I'm not really sure.\"Jiang Qing'e gave him a puppy-eyed look with her golden eyes, and she cocked her head innocently.Li Luo was planning to scold her, but the words stuck in his throat. She was so cute. Jiang Qing'e, it must be illegal for you to be so pretty and act so cute.Regretfully, she soon returned to normal. \"Not bad. It would have been enough to get into the Astral Sage College, but to think you took first place too.\"\"Sheesh. I was forced. I was forced from start to finish.\" Li Luo shook his head, indicating that he didn't want to elaborate.She made a small noise of amusement and did not pursue.Li Luo was aghast. Was she really not going to ask? He had finally gotten hold of something he could talk about to her, and she was not going to bite? Damn, that sucked.But still, he could only swallow it. He couldn't very well start talking about it. That would be embarrassing.He gulped.\"Let's go. I want to see Cai Wei and Lingqing, I haven't seen them in a while,\" Jiang Qing'e said. She took hold of her beasts' reins and draped a long leg over it, heading down the slope.Li Luo could only follow grumpily.The two made their way down as the sun began to set. Golden hour cast long shadows on the two, and from afar they seemed to merge into one.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing were watching from the carriage. \"They look like the perfect match.\"Yan Lingqing nodded in agreement. She had never been too concerned with looks, but she had to admit that few could compare to Li Luo in that aspect.Soon enough, Jiang Qing'e and Li Luo were with them.\"Qing'e, I've missed you to death!\" Yan Lingqing joyfully flew forwards to hug Jiang Qing'e. The latter's beautiful but aloof face warmed up considerably as she patted Yan Lingqing's back gently.Cai Wei's eyes were filled with joy as well. She was not as worked up as Yan Lingqing, but she came forth for a small hug too.Each of Jiang Qing'e's hands circled a waist. \"Sister Cai Wei, Lingqing, thanks for all your hard work.\"Behind her, Li Luo was feeling a little extra as he watched the three women hug.They had been through a lot at Southwind together after all. They were comrades now. He wouldn't mind celebrating together with them.\"Li Luo, come celebrate with us.\" Yan Lingqing's voice floated over.Li Luo looked over and was just about to reply when he saw Jiang Qing'e cocking her head at him, a half-smile on her lips. He kept his expression blank. \"Girls' celebration, that doesn't interest me,\" he said indifferently.Low giggles.He stood there and watched them catch up for what felt like the longest time. Finally, they seemed to come to a pause.Yan Lingqing and Cai Wei got on the red horses, while Jiang Qing'e got into the carriage.Li Luo was about to mount up as well, but he saw Jiang Qing'e looking at him with mischief in her golden eyes.\"Aren't you coming in? I still want to hear about your time in the exam.\"Li Luo started, then coughed quickly. \"Well, there's nothing much to...\"\"Forget it, then.\" She started to close the door.\"Hem. Well, if you insist on hearing about it, I guess I could tell you.\" Li Luo hurriedly changed directions. In a flash, he was boarding the carriage happily. Jiang Qing'e, you playful little minx.1. TN: Qiuying's name is written \u79cb\u9896, meaning autumn husk. Qing'e is calling her \u86af\u8693, meaning earthworm.

The thoroughfare was starting to get lively as well, with foot and vehicular traffic both swelling. Xia City was truly a large metropolis.In the carriage.Li Luo recounted his story of the College Final Examinations in a moderate tone. \"I just wanted to slip into the top 10 and get an entrance slot, but those people forced my hand.\"Jiang Qing'e was sprawled on the table, one hand propping up her chin. \"Lu Qing'er seems quite interested in you.\" She smiled.Li Luo almost choked. Was that the point of his story?\"We're just platonic. Classmates,\" he clarified.\"That doesn't mean anything. I always thought that she was quite good. If you can win her favor, that means you're quite attractive,\" she said sweetly. Li Luo looked at her lovely face, deep into her golden eyes. He could sense that she was truly not very bothered.But her not being bothered made him bothered. It meant that Jiang Qing'e hadn't really started to think of the two of them as a pair.She had her own feelings, and there was no doubt that they were complex. Perhaps she thought of him more as a childhood sweetheart, or an older sister and her younger brother.Perhaps she didn't know herself.But there was one thing he was sure of: Jiang Qing'e might be his fiance in name, she might trust him unconditionally and do many things for him, but in truth, she had yet to think of them as lovers.Still, not even lovers were as trusting of each other as this complex relationship that she shared with Li Luo.He sighed. He knew that such things could not be rushed. He just had to go at his own pace. If he wanted to sort this mess out, then the one necessary step was to cancel the engagement between them.Only then could Jiang Qing'e be free of her complex feelings, and truly begin to consider what they were to each other.Making a move on Jiang Qing'e was not to be taken lightly and could not be done prematurely.\"Still, I have to congratulate you. Your results in the exams were outstanding,\" Jiang Qing'e said appreciatively, oblivious to the internal struggle that Li Luo was going through.\"Does this mean I've reached your expectations for the first goal?\" he joked.\"Exceeded expectations, I must say.\"She had truly not expected him to do so well. Two months ago, he was a blank palace cultivator. Surpassing all of his peers in this time was testament to his talent and effort.\"Any additional rewards?\" Li Luo asked.She thought about it. \"Well, I'll let you spar with me.\"Her lip twitched. \"If you win, there really will be a reward.\"Li Luo paled. \u201cFight with you? Do you think I'm so keen on receiving a thrashing? If I could beat you, would I still be here talking crap with you? I would beat you up and take vengeance for all these tough years!\u201d\"But I'm more surprised that you actually turned House Luolan's profits in the Tianshu Province around. It's at a historical high, and Cai Wei has told me that it's all thanks to your contributions at the Suncreek Villa,\" Jiang Qing'e said with real feeling.\"I had no choice. If I hadn't found a way to increase our profits, I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to feed myself,\" Li Luo grumbled.\"Did Cai Wei tell you I need a ton of spirit liquids and purifying lights? I've used a lot of them in the past two months.\"Li Luo stretched out his palm, showing her his blue water resonance power. The purity made her eyes widen.\"When you first solved your blank palace problem at the old manor, your resonance grade was not this high,\" she said.From the purity, she would believe him even if he said he had a 7th-grade water resonance.But she clearly remembered that his resonance was far from this when she saw it back at the old manor.This had to be the result of the huge quantity of spirit liquids and purifying lights that he had consumed.Still, she was doubtful. Had he truly consumed so many liquids and lights in a mere two months?\"It's because of the acquired resonances. My palaces can take a lot more impurity than others. That's why I can use spirit liquids and purifying lights without care to increase my resonance quality.\" Li Luo grinned. This was the only person he could trust fully. There was no need to hold secrets around her.\"I see.\"She was still shocked. So this was the power of acquired resonances. No wonder he had improved so quickly.\"My resonance is already at the sixth grade, so I need a lot of sixth-grade liquids and lights. House Luolan's profits in Tianshu are already insufficient to feed me, you know.\"It was his turn now to act cute with Jiang Qing'e. \"So... Sister Qing'e, please feed me~\"She laughed and ignored the teasing. \"How many sixth-grade liquids and lights to advance?\"\"About 200. Conservative estimate,\" Li Luo quickly said. Sister Qing'e was the best. Cai Wei was too soft, she couldn't be depended on.\"Two hundred??\"Jiang Qing'e did some quick calculations. Sixth-grade liquids and lights went for 30,000 skygold apiece. 200 meant... six million skygold?She shook her head. \"Forget it. I can't afford you. I think I'll get someone to take you back to the City of Southwind.\"Li Luo was devastated. \"Jiang Qing'e! House Luolan has businesses across the land. Have you been embezzling the money? It's just a mere six million, why can't we afford it?\"She glared at him. \"Businesses across the land? The great roof of Luolan has been leaking non-stop. I've been desperately trying to fix it, but it's like plugging a flood with a pacifier. The savings have been dwindling these past few years.\"And Pei Hao. He's taken three pavilions, finances, and the human resources divisions too. You heard him as well. His three pavilions won't send another penny to headquarters. How on earth would you think House Luolan is rich?\"Li Luo was aghast. He had looked forward to coming to Xia City so he could tap on House Luolan's headquarters' resources. But they were poor here too?Then what was the point of being a young lord?!\"Two hundred sixth-grade spirit liquids and purifying lights. I can't get them immediately, but don't worry. I'll purchase them for you here and there. It will take some time though,\" Jiang Qing'e said.Li Luo breathed out. Well, that was to be expected.\"But thanks to your great work at the Suncreek Villa, I intend to involve you in the Suncreek Villa's headquarters. Pei Hao has been vying hard to take control there. If you can have it firmly in hand and grow it to a top-10 villa in the Xia Kingdom, then I think a mere 200 liquids and lights will be chump change for you.\" She gave him an encouraging fist pump with her dainty, little hand.\"Wow, thank you very much for your kindness,\" Li Luo said tonelessly.Make the Suncreek Villa a top-10 villa... Jiang Qing'e, you blackhearted maggot.Listening to the sounds outside, she opened a window, and a majestic view of the city rolled into view.Turning her golden eyes back to Li Luo, his youthful and almost childish features were reflected in her wide eyes.She reached out a hand and placed it on the back of his. It was cool, firm, perfect.She leaned in and spoke softly, her words clear as a cold ray of moonlight despite the din outside. They reached deep within him and calmed him.\"Li Luo, welcome to Xia City.\"And, I'm really happy you could come here,\" she said with a knowing smile and a glint in her eye. She was truly happy.A beauty's smile was a weapon in itself, and Jiang Qing'e's smile was a godly weapon. Li Luo was sunk.He suddenly felt a strong urge to fight someone for her.Speak, Sister Qing'e! Who shall we cut down today?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Straight rows of neatly paved stone, properly spaced. The roads were well connected and well planned, an efficient network linking up high-rise buildings that one could lose oneself in.There was no end to the people. Noisy, bustling\u2014the roar of the crowd was omnipresent.This was Xia City, the heart of the Xia Kingdom.While Li Luo was contemplating this intimidating city from his carriage window, Si Qiuying was on another street, stopping in front of an inn at a prime location by the road. She entered a posh room.\"Oh, you're back?\"A youth was sipping tea, lazily watching the street. He smiled when she walked in.He cut a handsome, noble figure, his brow sharp and his eyes keen. However, he had the same hair as Si Qiuying, green and smooth. It was a family trait.This was Si Qiuying's elder brother, Si Tianming.\"What's wrong? Met the Young Lord?\" Si Tianming asked cheerfully.\"Yes! A little slime! He tattled at the first sign of trouble. A childish, little kid!\" she burst out. \"And Sister Qing'e is so biased. She actually hit me,\" Si Qiuying complained. She had always been on good terms with Jiang Qing'e, who had treated her like a little sister. Now it was clear that she favored Li Luo much more.\"You're the childish one... Do you know what her relationship with Li Luo is? You were asking for it, trying to compete with Li Luo,\" Si Tianming said impatiently.\"I'm not fighting with him... Big Brother, Sister Qing'e said she's not interested in you,\" Si Qiuying said.Si Tianming just laughed it off. \"Of course she's not. Isn't that clear enough on the daily?\"Besides, someone as excellent as Jiang Qing'e definitely can say that.\"Si Qiuying was still not happy. \"Big Brother, maybe you can't compare to Sister Qing'e, but you're a hundred times better than Li Luo, right?\"You're a 4th-Star Hall student in the Astral Sage College. You're powerful, and even the mentors say that you have great potential to become a Duke!\"\"And you think a Duke will impress Jiang Qing'e?\"Si Tianming sighed. \"Qiuying, I told you before: the right to call off the engagement between Li Luo and Jiang Qing'e does not actually rest with Li Luo, but with Jiang Qing'e. If she isn't willing, no one can change a thing.\"\"Besides, I might like Jiang Qing'e, but that doesn't mean I have to pursue it.\"Si Qiuying sulked. \"Big Bro, you think you're a love saint? Let me ask you: if you were given the chance to woo Sister Qing'e, would you?\"Si Tianming gave her a sheepish smile.Si Qiuying gave him a look. \"Believe in yourself, Big Bro! Your talent, your strength, your reputation\u2014you're one of the elites in the younger generation of the Xia Kingdom. Persevere and Sister Qing'e will definitely see the good in you!\"And you're definitely a better match compared to Li Luo!\"Si Tianming gave an exasperated smile. \"Just keep your nose out of those matters. Also, don't go causing trouble for Li Luo either. There's no need. He's the Young Lord of House Luolan after all. If you cross him, I will not interfere when Jiang Qing'e comes for you.\"\"I couldn't care less about him,\" she said snootily.\"But he pissed me off today. The next time Duze Beixuan wants to cause trouble for him, I'm not going to help him.\"Si Tianming shook his head. It was not like the young lord couldn't handle himself. He was the champion of the Tianshu Province\u2014he must have earned it.However, House Duze seemed to be on the move lately. Perhaps House Luolan was their target......The carriage turned through the expansive streets, finally stopping outside a residence.This was the House Luolan headquarters.Li Luo and Jiang Qing'e stepped out. He whistled at the residence in appreciation. The old manor at Southwind was big, but it paled in comparison to this.Bodyguards patrolled the perimeter in groups while keen eyes were scanning from the watchtower.\"I've already informed the management to gather at headquarters tonight. Since you're the young lord, you should be familiar with the backbone of House Luolan,\" Jiang Qing'e said.She looked at Li Luo. \"These managers are in charge of House Luolan's businesses in Xia City. You should know that 60% of our yearly income comes from outside of Xia City, while a full 40% depends on the businesses in Xia City.\"Li Luo was surprised to hear this. House Luolan's Xia City revenue held a much higher percentage than he had expected.Truly the capital of the Xia Kingdom.\"When I first took over House Luolan a few years ago, the Xia City businesses had been decimated by Pei Hao. But after a few years of rectification, I've managed to cut away a lot of his meddling. Things here should be quite stable,\" she continued.\"You must have gone through a lot.\"The proportion of House Luolan's businesses in Xia City was major. If Pei Hao was allowed to rot their assets here, House Luolan's headquarters would be doomed. Luckily, Jiang Qing'e had stepped in to save House Luolan in time.As the two spoke, they had already walked through the main doors. Suddenly, a huge, burly figure cannonballed right at Li Luo, a loud voice booming out. \"Oh, my Young Lord! You're finally here in Xia City! This old ox has missed you so much!\"Li Luo felt like he was being attacked by a bowling ball. He was seized up in a hug that felt like a steel vice, squeezing all the air out of him.The person before him reeked of oil, a pungent odor that assailed Li Luo's nostrils.\"Uncle Biao, you're strangling him.\" Jiang Qing'e laughed, rescuing Li Luo.The burly man let go of him, and finally Li Luo could get a good look at him. He was a bald middle-aged man bulging with muscles. He was covered in a sheen of oil and had an almost barbaric look to him. At his waist, a pig cleaver gleamed.\"And you are...\" Li Luo stared at him. He had a vague impression, but he could not recall this man's name.\"Young Lord, it's me, Ox Biaobiao. Don't you remember me? I even made your meals when you were young,\" the bald strongman anxiously said.It lit up Li Luo's memory. Indeed, there was once a baldie accompanying him when he was young. But after a shift in the headquarters' manpower, that memory had come to an end.\"Uncle Biao has spent the longest time in House Luolan. Back when the Master and Mistress founded House Luolan, he was there. His cooking skills are famous in Xia City, and even now he oversees the food matters here,\" Jiang Qing'e told him brightly.Li Luo clapped his hands. \"I remember!\"Uncle Biao! You look like a real hulk, but you're so gentle that you won't even kill a chicken. I remember you lured me into the kitchen when I was young, to get me to help you kill the chicken!\"Ox Biaobiao's face froze. \"Young Lord, your memory is very good,\" he said sheepishly. \"You remember well indeed.\"Li Luo burst into laughter. Despite his ferocious appearance, his personality was the complete opposite. His looks alone could probably bring children to tears, and yet he wouldn't dare kill a chicken.Everyone said that the pig cleaver on Ox Biaobiao's waist had probably never touched blood in its life. It was pure decoration.The moment of hilarity over, Li Luo confirmed that this was indeed an old hand of House Luolan. He was deserving of trust.\"Uncle Biao, I'll be in your care again from now on.\" Li Luo reached out a hand to clap his meaty shoulder.Ox Biaobiao took his hand, moved. \"I had long wanted to go to the City of Southwind to take care of the Young Lord, but Little Jiang here didn't let me. Now that you're in Xia City, I will feed you until you pop.\"He measured Li Luo's arm. \"Young Lord, you're scrawny. I'll whip up a huge pot of nourishment!\"He turned and rushed away.\"Uncle Biao is as high-strung as ever.\" Li Luo smiled at the muscular figure hurrying off.\"Uncle Biao can be trusteed. I intended for him to take control of some of House Luolan's assets, but he refused. He just wants to be in the kitchen,\" Jiang Qing'e said.\"Whatever he's willing to do. No need to force the issue.\"Jiang Qing'e nodded. \"Let's go, then. I'll take you around. We'll eat later. The management should be here soon. Today might be a little more tiring.\"Li Luo smiled at her. \"What's this compared to how much you've suffered these few years, Sister Qing'e? You're so amazing.\"\"Your words have become sweeter. You must have had a lot of practice with the girls in school,\" Jiang Qing'e said with a curious smile.\"Are you jealous?\"She made a small, vague noise and strode off. Her lofty voice called back to him.\"Jealous? Nothing to be jealous of yet. Work hard, and maybe one day I'll know what that is.\"Li Luo stared at her elegant figure and hurried after, irritated.How was he supposed to reply? Jiang Qing'e, you're too much. We've drifted... No...You've been so aloof today... This didn't fit the mood.Oh forget it.\"What's for dinner tonight?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It uses nine different kinds of lingzhi mushrooms and has the gall bladder of a Pyreghost Bear and other assorted beasts. It's very nourishing.\"And this rice with spirit fruits has the cured juices of plenty of spirit fruits. The rice is three-month energy rice. After coming to maturity, we leave it in a place with high natural energy and let it bask for three months.\"And this one...\"In the dining room, Li Luo, Jiang Qing'e, Cai Wei, and Yan Lingqing were seated. Ox Biaobiao was scurrying back and forth with heaping platters. Each dish was fragrant as could be.\"That's too much nourishment.\" Li Luo didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He thought Ox Biaobiao was speaking metaphorically, but it seemed like he was serious on making Li Luo more herbal than a poultice.\"Your body is growing at this phase of your life, Young Lord. You need more nourishment. You can't go wrong,\" Ox Biaobiao beamed.\"Thanks, Uncle Biao. Let's eat.\"Jiang Qing'e seemed to accept it as normal. Thanking Ox Biaobiao, she began eating.Li Luo followed her lead, taking hearty helpings of these delicacies that were hard to get a hold of in the City of Southwind. He enjoyed them fully, giving Ox Biaobiao a big thumbs up to show his appreciation.After stuffing himself, Li Luo felt a strong fire within his body that made him feel hot all over.Thanks to Biaobiao's exceptional culinary skills, even Jiang Qing'e and Cai Wei could not maintain their decorum, and tucked in with uncommon fervor.Ox Biaobiao watched them tackle the mountain of food with a big, satisfied smile on his face.When they had all eaten their fill, he called servants over to clean the tables and then serve them each a cup of sweet tea.\"This is Floweret Steeped Tea. After eating those highly nourishing foods, you need something strongly calming to quench the fires of the body.\"Li Luo drank it all in one gulp and then felt his body begin cooling down immediately. It seemed like the resonant power within him had grown stronger.\"Uncle Biao's the best,\" Li Luo marveled.Ox Biaobiao's laughter boomed out. \"Young Lord, you're too kind. I will prepare it for you daily. Nourish you up.\"He packed the table and took his leave.Li Luo stared at Ox Biaobiao's retreating figure with a tingle of suspicion. He kept saying Li Luo was empty and needed nourishment...Just a casual remark?Or... did he know something?Two months ago, he had gained acquired resonances. He had indeed been empty of blood essence, and even his lifespan had been shortened... But he had not even told Jiang Qing'e, to spare her the worry.Could it be that Uncle Biao... knew? Impossible.Li Luo turned back to Jiang Qing'e, who was delicately sipping at her tea. \"How strong is Uncle Biao?\" he asked in a low voice.She looked up at him. \"I saw him use resonant power a long time ago. Roughly at the Resonant Master stage.\"Li Luo didn't really believe that. He was average...?She seemed to guess what he was thinking. \"There's no need to speculate. All we need to know is that Uncle Biao is trustworthy. That's all,\" she said simply.Li Luo thought about it and nodded. Indeed, there was no need to overthink it. Whether he was stronger than he let on or not, if he wasn't going to volunteer information, they shouldn't push it out of him. After all, if his parents had entrusted all food matters at House Luolan's headquarters to him, he had their absolute trust.Jiang Qing'e unhurriedly sipped her tea. Finally, she rose. \"Let's go. It's about time.\"Li Luo stood up as well, sucking in a deep breath. It was showtime. A declaration of the young lord's presence to all at House Luolan's headquarters, and that he was here for good.In the future, he would be one of the controlling powers here.It was a simple yet highly significant custom.Calming himself, he followed Jiang Qing'e out of the hall. They passed through a long corridor and pushed through a set of doors at the end.The blindingly bright lights inside forced Li Luo to squint as he entered.When his eyes adjusted, he saw that many people were seated behind the long tables at both sides of the room. They were all looking at him with unreadable expressions.There was a strange stiffness in the atmosphere here.Jiang Qing'e's voice rang out to break it. \"Do you all not see the Young Lord here?\"Only then did they stand up in twos and threes, cupping their hands. \"Our respects to the Young Lord.\"Li Luo smilingly replied to them in kind. \"My respects to you too.\"They could all see that this unusually handsome young man had inherited the looks of Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan. However, none of their charisma or natural commanding presence were visible. Instead, all they saw was youthful greenness.Many of the higher management at House Luolan had forgotten about Li Luo ever since his blank palaces had come to light. Even though he was the rightful heir to the house, his blank palaces had pronounced his death sentence.No one would be willing to leave House Luolan in the hands of a powerless young lord.Therefore, they had put him out of mind in recent years. And now the mascot of House Luolan had appeared before them again.However, he was no longer the same blank palace cultivator that he once was. He was first in the Tianshu Province's exams and had earned his place in the Astral Sage College.Although the difference between him and Jiang Qing'e was still huge, he was no longer a complete invalid. If the two truly married in the future, perhaps there would still be hope for House Luolan.Unsure of how to feel yet, they again cupped their hands in respect.\"This is Pavilion Master Lei Zhang, on the Council of Nine. You should have met him before. He is the only Pavilion Master who remains at House Luolan's headquarters. He is also in charge of the headquarters' security matters.\" She pointed to a middle-aged man in the foremost seat on the left. Li Luo had noticed him when Pei Hao had come to the old manor.\"This is the master of the resonant artifacts workshop, Yuan Jin.\"Li Luo looked at him. He was a scholarly middle-aged man that did not look at all the part of a resonant artifacts expert.\"And the pill workshop mistress, An Hongyan.\"She was a beautiful matron with a prim air about her, clad in white.\"Greetings, Young Lord.\"The three that Jiang Qing'e had just introduced held high positions in House Luolan, and they all bowed to him.Li Luo nodded in acknowledgement. He neither appeared too friendly nor too cold.Li Luo noticed something wrong. The Suncreek Villa's headquarters management was not here.He turned to Jiang Qing'e, who was also looking cold and angry. Her voice rang out with steel in it.\"Where is the Suncreek Villa's President Hanzhi?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Absolute ResonanceAbsolute Resonance Chapter 0095\u2013 Presidential TakeoffPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Qing'e's voice rang out coldly, met by mutters and exchanged glances within the hall.\"Miss, someone was sent to the Suncreek Villa's headquarters to convey the message. President Hanzhi should have hurried over if he received the message,\" Lei Zhang said.Jiang Qing'e nodded. \"Seems like we have a problem.\"\"Is President Hanzhi Pei Hao's man?\" Li Luo asked.Today was his presentation as the young lord of House Luolan. The management staff knew it was important. Even if they did not respect him, they had to respect Jiang Qing'e.And if this Hanzhi was planning to disrespect both, then he had to be a diehard Pei Hao supporter.Jiang Qing'e shook her head. \"Hanzhi is not one of Pei Hao's. He has always swung between us, a shrewd and cunning person. There's no reason he wouldn't be here...\"\"If he's not here, there must be trouble.\"\"Or,\" Li Luo said softly, \"he found a buyer even more attractive than either of you?\"The entire room turned to him in horror. This meant... Hanzhi had betrayed House Luolan?!Jiang Qing'e's eyes narrowed too, then her expression became even more grim than before.She felt that Li Luo's guess might just be exactly right.As the whispers grew around the room, there suddenly came the sound of hurried footfalls from outside. An old man barged in.Li Luo recognized him as Zheng Ping, who had come to the City of Southwind before. He had affirmed Yan Lingqing's position there.Zheng Ping was an elder of the Suncreek Villa's headquarters. He had a wealth of experience. Right now, his weathered face was creased in anger.\"Young Lord, Young Mistress, that scumbag Hanzhig suddenly announced that he's leaving the Suncreek Villa for House Duze's Bigswamp Villa. Before he left, he took half the Suncreek Villa resonance artificers with him. Worse, the cursed devil even burned the formula research center!\" Zheng Ping shouted hoarsely, his face miserable.There was a collective gasp across the meeting room. All of House Luolan's management was dismayed.Was Hanzhi crazy? A betrayal of House Luolan, poaching the Suncreek Villa's resonance artificers, and arson at the formula research center?!A loud outcry of anger exploded in the meeting room.Li Luo's face was grave. He had worked in the Suncreek Villa's branch workshop before. He knew well that the most important thing to a villa was the resonance artificers.If Hanzhi was dissatisfied with the Suncreek Villa, he could have chosen to leave, no problem. But to break and bury the Suncreek Villa with his departure?And the formula research center. That was the lifeblood of any villa. Immense capital had been poured into experimentation and research. And now it had all been burned down by Hanzhi. It was a devastating loss.One more point. He could have chosen to leave any time, but he had purposely waited for the young lord's return to do such a despicable thing... No one would believe that it was not a targeted attack on Li Luo.\"Silence.\"Jiang Qing'e's voice sharply silenced the hall.\"This is a well-calculated plot of House Duze against House Luolan.\" There was no apparent anger on her face, only seriousness.Her calmness helped them control their anger as well.\"House Duze again...\" Li Luo sat down beside Jiang Qing'e. He had heard it straight from Si Qiuying's lips\u2014House Duze had it in for him from the moment he set foot in Xia City. This was a masterful stroke they had delivered.\"They must have spent quite a lot to pull Hanzhi to them. Otherwise, he would not have dealt such a cruel blow,\" Jiang Qing'e said. This was not only a move against House Luolan, but also against the new leader, Li Luo, the young lord.They had purposely chosen their timing to completely embarrass Li Luo and reduce his standing within House Luolan.After all, a change in leadership being immediately met with such a tragic betrayal was sure to get people pointing fingers at Li Luo.They might even say that the young lord was so out of touch with the management that their people were fleeing from him.Li Luo sighed inwardly. So these were house politics? Cruel, savage, cutthroat. Compared to them, the City of Southwind's Song family looked like a child's squabble.\"House Duze has gone too far! This is underhanded!\" Lei Zhang shouted in a trembling voice.\"We have always been rivals. It is naive to blame our enemies for being harsh,\" Jiang Qing'e said flatly. \"We will remember this. We will pay them back when the time comes.\"Although she was angry, she quashed it down with logic. She knew that House Luolan could not engage in all-out war, if the house was to survive this storm.\"Young Lord, Young Mistress, the Suncreek Villa is in disarray right now. You have to do something.\"Pang Qianchi is only adding fuel to the fire. He says that since Hanzhi has left, there should be a new president...\" Zheng Ping reported with barely suppressed fury.Jiang Qing'e turned to Li Luo. \"Pang Qianchi is a Pei Hao supporter. He has always blocked my interventions at the Suncreek Villa. When Hanzhi sat back neutrally, Pang Qianchi could control many things at the Suncreek Villa.\"Li Luo gave her a small nod. This was similar to the situation back at Tianshu, although this Pang Qianchi was probably much harder to deal with than Zhuang Yi.He had heard the story regarding the headquarters' vice president back at the City of Southwind. He was once a strong contender to be President of the Suncreek Villa, and was favored over Hanzhi at one time. However, his parents ended up choosing Hanzhi over Pang Qianchi.Perhaps his resentment of Li Luo's parents was the reason he immediately turned to Pei Hao the moment they disappeared.But now it seemed like neither Hanzhi nor Pang Qianchi could be relied upon. He could not blame his parents. When House Luolan was in its fledgling years and growing, they were sorely lacking talent. They could only make do with what they had, and make a note to replace the bad people later.But before these two could be replaced, they had vanished.\"Elder Zheng, please help calm things down over at the Suncreek Villa's headquarters. Tomorrow, the young lord and I will personally go and sort things out. Do not worry. The Suncreek Villa is precious to the House Lords and many of the elders. We will not let it fall into ruin,\" Jiang Qing'e said soothingly to Zheng Ping.\"Alright.\" Zheng Ping immediately turned away after paying his respects to Li Luo and Jiang Qing'e. He hurried off.With his departure, the mood in the meeting hall returned to normal, although this was only on the surface. House Duze had chosen the perfect time to strike, souring the young lord's return.Starting tomorrow, word would spread all over Xia City, and they would be made fools of.House Duze was disgustingly low.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This one was enough to raise a wave of heat up his nostrils. He tapped them gingerly, checking for a nosebleed.After breakfast, Li Luo followed Jiang Qing'e to the Suncreek Villa's headquarters. And as an important member of the Suncreek Villa and the House Luolan management, of course Cai Wei was there too.They sat comfortably in the spacious carriage, the fragrance of the three women mingling sweetly in the air within.\"Qing'e, although Hanzhi didn't lift a finger when he was president, Pang Qianchi was a bit more circumspect with him around. Now that Hanzhi is gone, he'll run rampant for sure,\" Yan Lingqing said worriedly, fussing with her silver-rimmed spectacles.\"The Suncreek Villa's headquarters is in shambles. We have to quickly appoint a new president to calm things down and get production underway, or the losses will continue to escalate,\" Cai Wei fretted.\"Probably Pang Qianchi's goal...\"Jiang Qing'e nodded. \"Given Pang Qianchi's reputation and artificer skill, there's no one who can compare to him. He'll definitely be the favorite in the running for president. Even the moderate majority would choose him.\"\"But if we make him president, there's going to be trouble. Pei Hao will be able to step all over us. It's a one-way ticket down to our doom,\" Cai Wei said.\"Urgh,\" Yan Lingqing hissed. While she might be competent enough to hold her own in the Tianshu Province, her skills were insufficient here at the Suncreek Villa's headquarters. Her appointment would have to be forced through, and it would incite dissatisfaction. The stubborn old geezers in the Suncreek Villa would be first on the protest line.\"It's not as though we don't have other candidates though,\" Jiang Qing'e said with a light laugh.Yan Lingqing and Cai Wei looked at her, astonished.She nodded forwards, gesturing with her dainty, little chin. Yan Lingqing and Cai Wei turned to look at Li Luo.\"Me?\" Li Luo was startled at the sudden nomination by Jiang Qing'e.\"Although I'm a resonance artificer, I'm only a second-grade... That's definitely not enough to become the Suncreek Villa's president, right?\"Jiang Qing'e smiled. \"Ability-wise, perhaps. But you have another advantage\u2014your status.\"You are the young lord of House Luolan. Even the old geezers at the Suncreek Villa would have no reason to refuse your support at headquarters. Besides, you're not without your own accolades. The Tianshu Province's Suncreek Villa flourished under Lingqing and your care. You should be proud.\"You might not even have noticed it yourself, but you are the best person to take up the role of president.\"There was a spark in Yan Lingqing and Cai Wei's eyes as they saw the merits of Jiang Qing'e's idea.Li Luo mulled it over. \"I guess I could take up the president role temporarily. But look at the state of the Suncreek Villa's headquarters! Resonance artificers leaving in droves and internal strife aplenty. If the Suncreek Villa wants to get its future back on track and compete against top villas like the Bigswamp Villa, there must be changes.\"\"I already spoke to Sister Qing'e last night about them.\"Jiang Qing'e fell silent for a moment too and then finally nodded seriously.\"You are the rightful young lord of House Luolan. If you think it is possible, I will support you.\"\"Then my early thanks to Sister Qing'e for your support.\" Li Luo grinned.Cai Wei and Yan Lingqing looked back and forth curiously, in the dark regarding this exchange.......The Suncreek Villa's headquarters were at the south of Xia City, in the same region as the headquarters of House Luolan. However, the sluggish city traffic and complex road systems meant that more than an hour passed before they arrived. Xia City was much bigger than the City of Southwind.Compared to the City of Southwind's branch office, the headquarters here were much grander as well.There were stone lions flanking the main doors, and flights of steps that elevated the dignity and grandeur of the place. Through the main doors, towering buildings loomed within.There was a constant flow of people both ways. Occasionally, they would stop and gesture at the headquarters, laughing among themselves.Evidently, news of the resonance artificer migration to the Bigswamp Villa had spread far and wide across Xia City.As their coach rolled to a stop, their arrival was immediately noticed by the bystanders.\"That silver-haired kid, is that the young lord of House Luolan, Li Luo?\"\"What a dashing young man, the spitting image of his father. Wow! Back in the day, Li Taixuan was the dream guy of many noble girls in Xia City. He got himself some haters because of that.\"\"Li Luo looks ready to surpass him.\"\"Heh. Li Taixuan was popular because he wasn't just a pretty face\u2014his talent was unbelievable. The Youngest Duke in the Xia Kingdom\u2014now that's a title that shines brightly. This Li Luo, though, a prettier vessel, sure, but far more hollow.\"\"I heard that it was precisely his arrival that made President Hanzhi run away...\"\"Does that even make sense?\"\"Haha, who knows? But there must be some connection, right? Can't be a coincidence.\"\"......\"Li Luo ignored the whispers around him as he ascended the stairs with Jiang Qing'e, Cai Wei, and Yan Lingqing, entering the building.Within the compound, the usually picturesque environment was now in tatters. There was no one of rank to welcome them, only a few servants hurrying forth.\"Where are the elders and Vice President Pang?\" Jiang Qing'e asked calmly.The servants looked at each other, then bowed them towards the back. \"Elder Zheng Ping and the others are arguing with him,\" they whispered.Jiang Qing'e swept past them without further comment.Li Luo and the others hurried after her.They passed through a short boulevard to a courtyard centered around a fountain. There were many people here, all dressed in the Suncreek Villa resonance artificer robes.\"Gentlemen, Hanzhi was sick in the head. He not only betrayed the Suncreek Villa, but also burned down our research labs. We should never have made him president. It should always have been Vice President Pang!\" someone shouted.Their collective anger at Hanzhi had put them in an agreeable mood to anyone else.\"Yeah! Hanzhi's a damned animal! Let's put Vice President Pang in charge!\"\"We need to fill the position quickly and get things under control. Vice President Pang's the logical choice!\"Elder Zheng Ping stood firm amongst them. \"The Young Lord and Mistress will make the decision. Who are you to decide?!\"\"Things were fine before that young lord came! A real harbinger of trouble...\" someone grumbled.\"Who's that talking nonsense?!\" Zheng Ping glared at the crowd. \"When did a puppy like you grow a spine? The Young Lord has come to smooth things over. His presence brings nothing but good. You shortsighted sparrows, stop your chirping!\" No one dared to argue back. Elder Zheng Ping's fiery temper was famous in the Suncreek Villa.\"Keke, no need to get angry, Elder Zheng Ping. No one is blaming the Young Lord. But it's understandable that everyone's a little flustered in these times.\" A bright voice rang out, and a man walked out from the crowd.The middle-aged man had thin eyes and a warm expression on his face. There were cheers upon his arrival. \"Vice President Pang, you're here!\"Elder Zheng Ping looked at him with a hostile expression. \"Pang Qianchi, I'm not even going to waste my breath on you. The Young Lord and Mistress will be here shortly. There's no need to play these crowdpulling games. They will make their own choices. Just wait and see.\"The narrow-eyed Vice President Pang Qianchi snickered softly.But before he spoke, someone from the crowd called out, \"We'll only acknowledge Vice President Pang in the Suncreek Villa. Only he is qualified to lead the Suncreek Villa! We won't accept anyone else!\"Elder Zheng Ping was seething fit to burst, his anger whitening his face along his wrinkles.He too knew that Pang Qianchi was swooping in for the kill. Hanzhi's betrayal was very fortuitous for him.Elder Zheng Ping also knew that in terms of qualifications and ability, there was no one who could match Pang Qianchi. There was no one else who would win the approval of the Suncreek Villa's artificers.If things blew up yet again, perhaps even the remaining resonance artificers would leave. That would be the final nail in the Suncreek Villa's coffin.Even he could not see a way out of this dilemma.Just as he was despairing, a calm voice cut through the noise.\"I think... that I can give the president position a try.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A hothead shouted, \"Which arrogant idiot is that!?\" An angry roar of agreement followed his call, and they turned as one in the direction of the voice. Their voices faded away.They saw a silver-haired youth looking at them with a wry smile on his face.Beside him was a willowy diva staring coldly at them. Jiang Qing'e.Her presence confirmed the identity of the young man, and it was mildly amusing to watch their faces contort in embarrassment. As panicked as they were, no one dared to maintain the bluster from before.\"What? No respect for the Young Lord and Mistress?!\" Elder Zheng Ping roared.The resonance artificers hesitated briefly and then murmured their respects in a ragtag chorus.Pang Qianchi was looking at Li Luo with alarm. He had seen him once before, a long time ago when the house headquarters was still in the City of Southwind. The young Li Luo already showed his resemblance to Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan back then.Elder Zheng Ping pushed past the crowd and cupped his hands respectfully to the pair. \"Young Lord, what did you just say?\" he asked worriedly.\"I said that since the position of the Suncreek Villa president lies open, I'll take up the role temporarily,\" Li Luo said casually.Elder Zheng Ping stammered in confusion. \"Ah... but....\"He was about to say that it was completely against the rules, but this was the young lord. Who else was more qualified to bend the rules as he pleased?The Suncreek Villa resonance artificers also looked around at each other with a disapproval that they could not voice. They were unsure of how to broach the issue.Pang Qianchi spoke with just a hint of mockery. \"Young Lord, surely there is no need to humble your esteemed self to the lowly position of president. Such roles are not even worthy of your attention, although mere mortals like us work hard to even achieve them.\"If an august presence like yourself sweeps in to take it, then it's rather unfair to us normal mortals who have worked so hard for all these years at the Suncreek Villa, don't you think?\"Pang Qianchi belied his cunning in these words. Every point he made seemed to speak on behalf of the Suncreek Villa artificers. At the same time, they were laced with an underlying challenge.It was working, and the resonance artificers stirred in response.Li Luo looked at Pang Qianchi for a few moments. This old fox was indeed harder to deal with than Zhuang Yi.\"I am a resonance artificer too, albeit a second-grade one. I cannot compare to your wiser selves. But I think the job of president is not just about creating spirit liquids and purifying lights. The president must have the ability to make the Suncreek Villa stronger,\" Li Luo commented mildly.\"I wonder, do you know about what happened at the Tianshu Province's Suncreek Villa? In yesteryears, the profit was roughly 100,000 skygold, but under my leadership it increased to 300,000, a full threefold increase.\"If I remember correctly, the Suncreek Villa headquarters only turns a yearly profit of about one million?\" Li Luo asked calmly, soothing the crowd and working to unravel their defensiveness. Had a mere branch of the Suncreek Villa managed to turn a 300,000 skygold profit? That was a full third of the headquarters!Yan Lingqing stepped forwards. \"It is indeed as the Young Lord says. If anyone doubts it, you can check for yourselves.\"Seeing how sure Yan Lingqing was, the whispers were fading away now. If it was true, then this young lord was a real monster indeed!Although ability was important for the role of president, wasn't the ultimate goal to make the Suncreek Villa stronger?Pang Qianchi's jowls quivered with anger. He had not expected Li Luo to show up in person.\"Young Lord, are you trying to discourage us?\" Pang Qianchi burst out.\"Does Vice President Pang find my appointment discouraging?\" Li Luo countered.Pang Qianchi could not reply to this, so he skirted the issue. \"I have worked hard on behalf of the Suncreek Villa for all these years, and everyone here can attest to that. I competed against Hanzhi for the president position, but the two House Lords chose him. I accepted my loss. But now Hanzhi's betrayal shows that they made the wrong decision. Why can't the Young Lord work towards righting that wrong?\"Li Luo smiled at him. \"Vice President Pang has indeed worked hard on behalf of the Suncreek Villa for many years. But now? Will it be for Pei Hao?\"\"Pei Hao is also a disciple of the two House Lords. I am loyal to House Luolan, and all I do is for its sake!\" Pang Qianchi asserted stoutly.\"Hanzhi's betrayal means that the Suncreek Villa is now short an experienced fifth-grade resonance artificer. If the Young lord continues to break all the rules, the Suncreek Villa might well lose another experienced master.\" His threats were coming forth more clearly now.With Pei Hao supporting him, evidently Pang Qianchi was not afraid of Jiang Qing'e and Li Luo.After all, Pei Hao could kick up a real fuss if they did anything to him. That would only harm House Luolan further.\"Pang Qianchi, you insolent\u2014!\" Elder Zheng Ping was red in the face.Pang Qianchi was unafraid, lifting his head defiantly. \"I just want the Young Lord to be more reasonable. All that I have done is for the Suncreek Villa's good!\"\"Will you all support me?\" He turned to the other artificers.There was some hesitation, then they slowly came forth one by one. \"Vice President Pang is indeed the best choice to be president.\"Their views were not wrong. In terms of ability and experience, there was no better candidate.But... How could these be the only terms they had considered?Hearing their voices, Li Luo empathized. Who would choose an unknown young lord over the familiar presence that Pang Qianchi held in their hearts?He did not get angry. Instead, he walked forwards to the stage. \"Do you know how I managed to raise the Tianshu Province's Suncreek Villa to where it is in a mere two months?\"They looked at each other, curious. After all, he was a mere second-grade resonance artificer. How had he managed to turn around an entire branch of the Suncreek Villa?\"It's very simple. I mastered a special watersource. I believe that with this watersource, the Suncreek Villa's headquarters will also see a huge improvement. Entering the top 10 will not be beyond reach.\"There was a loud uproar of surprise at this.\"Secret watersource?! The Young Lord has a secret watersource?!\"As resonance artificers, they knew how incomparably precious secret watersources were to a villa. The formula for one's own trademark waterlight resonance was worth more than millions of skygold.After all these years, the Suncreek Villa still had not come up with its own patented watersource, such was its rarity.As for the famous villas in the Xia Kingdom, each had multiple secret watersources and formulas. Therefore, if the Suncreek Villa wanted to become a top villa, the foremost requisite was to find their own patented formula.Hearing that Li Luo actually had his own patented formula was enough to knock them out of their preconceived notions.Pang Qianchi's expression did not slip. \"Even though you have a secret watersource, how pure is it? Something just above average will not be able to make up for the gap.\"Li Luo had to smile at Pang Qianchi's stubbornness. He pulled out a few glass bottles and tossed them out to the resonance artificers.Stubbornness? I have just the cure.Elder Zheng Ping took one bottle as well. After quickly opening it, he poured out a few drops and tested what was inside. There was astonishment on his old, creased face.\"This... this secret watersource is at least a seventh-grade! A high seventh-grade in purity!\"\u201cWOW!\u201dThe other resonance artificers tested the purity, and everyone was equally amazed. Their hands shook as they passed around the bottles reverently.Upper seventh-grade... A watersource of such quality could perhaps only be found in the best of the Xia Kingdom's villas!All of the artificers looked at Li Luo with a new light of enthusiasm now.With such a pure watersource, they could not only refine much better spirit liquids, but frequent refining with it would also improve their own resonance arts. With some luck, they could break through their respective bottlenecks and reach the next grade.This was similar to how Li Luo had helped Yan Lingqing create a fifth-grade spirit liquid back during the Festival of Purifying Spirits...This was why all resonance artificers wanted to join villas with watersources of high purity. It was better for them to hone their refining skills there.And with that seventh-grade secret watersource, Li Luo had stolen away all of their hearts...Li Luo looked at Pang Qianchi with a half-smile on his face.\"Anything else, Vice President Pang?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was unprepared for Li Luo's finishing move.The details of Tianshu's branch had not reached headquarters, so even he was not sure of what had happened there...He knew now. Li Luo's secret seventh-grade watersource was the magic behind Tianshu's success.But how could Li Luo have such a powerful watersource?!Could it be an inheritance from the two House Lords? But if that was the case, why would he not take it out earlier? With a watersource of such quality, the Suncreek Villa would definitely be many times stronger than it currently was!Pang Qianchi reeled from the confusion. Li Luo ignored him. He turned to the other resonance artificers. \"So, am I qualified to be president now?\"Silence greeted him, and the hothead from before hung his head shamefully.In this situation, silence meant consent.Elder Zheng Ping's rage had already subsided fully. \"No objections from me,\" he stated.He spoke on behalf of many of the moderate artificers, who were fully intending to lend Li Luo their support now.Pang Qianchi's face was stony as he struggled with his anger. In his mind, the position of president was already his, but now Li Luo had swooped in to take it away. All of his carefully ministrated opportunities had been thoroughly swept away.It seemed like he had no other reason to block Li Luo's ascension.However, he had already swayed many resonance artificers to his side before this. Although Li Luo might have won this battle, he had yet to win the war.With those who had promised to follow him, he could continue a secret struggle against Li Luo. He would start attending the Astral Sage College soon, so he would not have much time left with them. Once he left, wouldn't the Suncreek Villa be back in his hands again?He had run a tight ship with the Suncreek Villa before. Was a young lord really going to change anything?Thinking thus, Pang Qianchi managed to calm himself. So be it. The fight would simply take a little longer than expected. Pei Hao had already told him: just hold on until next year's housemeet. He would make his move then. And when House Luolan was dust, who would care about a lord of nothing?When Pang Qianchi fell silent, Li Luo's gaze swept their ranks. \"Since there seems to be no objections, then I will assume the role of the Suncreek Villa's headquarters' president. I ask for your kind regard.\"The gathered resonance artificers dutifully applauded. Such was the temptation of an upper seventh-grade watersource.\"The proverb goes: a new boss cracks the whip three times. Let me crack the whip for the first time.\"Li Luo declared. He turned to Pang Qianchi. \"Vice President Pang, you have worked very hard. I give you a year's leave. Please enjoy your rest at home.\"In other words, a temporary removal of Pang Qianchi.Pang Qianchi remained unmoved. Was this young lord so naive to think that removing him would lessen his influence at the Suncreek Villa in any way?Those he had swayed to his side would be his eyes and ears. He would simply use different methods to interfere in the Suncreek Villa's affairs.Some resonance artificers frowned doubtfully. Li Luo seemed to be moving too hastily. It might not be good for the Suncreek Villa's future.But before anyone could speak up on Pang Qianchi's behalf, Li Luo suddenly announced, \"I know that some of you have been swayed by Pang Qianchi, and your allegiance is with Pei Hao.\"There was a jolt of panic suddenly, and some queasy looks could be spotted on faces.Pang Qianchi frowned as well. He stared at Li Luo. What was he planning to do? It was not a hard guess to make, but what could he do?\"Perhaps you think you can communicate with Pang Qianchi in secret, but you're underestimating the intelligence network of House Luolan...\"Li Luo said with a calm expression. He pulled out a scroll that was sealed with wax. \"This is the list of all who have turned to Pang Qianchi's side.\"There was even more restless shuffling now, but no one spoke. They waited quietly.The tension in the atmosphere was palpable.Pang Qianchi started. Was he intending to cull them based on the list? If so, that was incredibly bold. Still, the price would be a thorough sacking of the Suncreek Villa.With some resonance artificers stolen away by Hanzhi, if Li Luo chased even more of them away, it would be virtually impossible for the Suncreek Villa to resume normal operations any time soon. That would be a huge loss.Elder Zheng Ping's face was rigid with tension as well. One wrong move, he knew, would bring the whole Suncreek Villa crashing into disaster.The silence continued to build until some found it difficult to breathe.\"I haven't looked at the list yet.\"Li Luo said calmly. And then he pulled out a flare, setting the scroll on fire. The flames ate at the paper hungrily.He then carelessly tossed the burning scroll aside.He had their attention now, and all eyes were staring at the burning scroll.They did not understand.As for Pang Qianchi, he was staring at Li Luo fearfully now.He seemed to have guessed what Li Luo was up to.\"Gentlemen, you all know what has been going on in House Luolan in recent years very well. The fact that all of you have remained here through these hard times speaks of at least some loyalty.\"It is normal for you to falter in hard times. Therefore, I pledge to you here, in the capacity of a young lord, that all you have done in the past will be wiped away clean, just as this namelist burns. As long as you are willing to work hard on the Suncreek Villa's behalf in the future, you are a valued member.\"Have no fear, your previous allegiances will not be used as blackmail against you.\"His declaration gave them much to ponder. They did not know if the namelist he had was real, but that was not important compared to the significance of the pardon he had just pledged.Clearly, he was prepared to extend his generosity in order to assure the stability of the Suncreek Villa.\"Moreover, the Suncreek Villa intends to take out 20% of all profits in the future, which will be passed on to the resonance artificers as remuneration, through higher salaries and other perks.\"If Li Luo's burning of the list had been enough to make them reconsider, this further push was enough to bring them over into joy.Resonance artificers joined villas for two purposes. One was to improve themselves, and the other was to earn money. After all, they all had families to feed.Li Luo had first presented them with a high-purity watersource that would help them improve in the future. And now, a salary increase. 20% of the Suncreek Villa's profits was no small number\u2014it was enough to match what the best villas were paying.This meant that the Suncreek Villa would have a bright and rich future ahead of it.How could they not rejoice at such news? Moreover, they were sure that this declaration would bring resonance artificers flocking to the Suncreek Villa.Anyone with the slightest shred of acumen could see that the Suncreek Villa was about to take flight in the near future.They looked at Li Luo with renewed passion now flaring in their eyes.This young lord was far more capable than they had expected.As for Pang Qianchi, the blood was steadily draining from his face as he watched Li Luo appeal to the artificers. He had made one masterful move after another. It would pull away the majority of his followers.Li Luo's combination of punches was enough to undo much of the work that he had done before.Pang Qianchi was getting the feeling that his hands were being tied tighter and tighter. They had underestimated this young lord\u2014he seemed to be a more formidable opponent than they had given him credit for.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
