    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - Reborn Into a VillainessAct 0. The Death of a VillainessWhen the girl was young, her mother passed away. Her only remaining family member was her father, who never stayed at home. For as long she could remember, the girl was on her own.\u2018I want to see my father,\u2019 she decided one day.The girl, who yearned for the company of her only family member, secretly went to meet him. However, she received a cold response.\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2026\u201dWith a thundering voice, the man scolded the girl on the verge of tears.\u201cDo not come here again,\u201d he ordered.The girl didn\u2019t expect him to welcome her, for she was used to his cold indifference, but this sharp memory left a deep scar.\u2018My father doesn\u2019t love me,\u2019 she thought.With a wounded heart, the girl grew older and made her debut in high society.\u2018He didn\u2019t come today either.\u2019Her grand debutante ball was held in the absence of her father. She eventually left the banquet hall, feeling miserable.\u2018Did he not come because he\u2019s ashamed of me?\u2019As she cried to herself, a man appeared in front of her.\u201cWhy are you crying, my lady?\u201dHis words were warm and his gaze attentive. For the man, it may have been a kindness that he could have given to anyone. But for the girl who had been starved of intimacy for so many years, it felt like he was her savior.After that day, she started to follow him like a shadow, begging for his love until she succeeded in becoming his lover.\u201cI\u2019ll give you anything you want. All you have to do is love me.\u201dBut reality strayed from her wishes.\u201cI don\u2019t need your love anymore. Truthfully, I\u2019ve fallen in love with the princess.\u201dHe said goodbye to the girl, whose only dream was to marry him. After their three-year relationship, the breakup left her devastated.\u201cEven you\u2026 abandoned me. I will never forgive you.\u201dAfter some time passed, the princess who had stolen her lover consumed poison at a banquet and fell into a coma. This posed a problem because many people had witnessed the person who gave the poisoned cup to the princess.\u201cYou! Did you try to hurt her?\u201dThe girl, who had now blossomed into a woman, frantically shook her head. Although she hated the princess for stealing the man she loved, she never wanted to hurt her. She had simply handed the cup to the princess because she had asked for a drink to quench her thirst.\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me!\u201dBut no one believed her. The circumstances surrounding this incident, as well as her usual conduct, marked her as the culprit.When this became certain, the emperor ordered in anger, \u201cTake that wicked girl to the underground prison. Now!\u201dBut no one moved to receive his orders. Perhaps this was because standing behind the woman was an even more fearful figure than the emperor himself.\u2018Father.\u2019Although he had always been indifferent towards her, they were still family. The woman cried while latching onto his hand. Despite his age, he looked like a young man.\u201cFather, I really didn\u2019t!\u201dHe brushed her off, and her eyes widened in astonishment.Duke Floyen stared at the emperor as he spoke. \u201cI will personally arrest her.\u201dThe emperor, who was wary of the transcendent man in front of him, sighed. \u201cHow can I trust you? I know you\u2019re just going to cause trouble!\u201dDuke Floyen opened his mouth to appease his anger. \u201cYou will have no choice but to trust me if I lock her up in the Room of Shadows.\u201dThe Room of Shadows was a prison cell that confined the most unforgivable sinners. Neither magic nor weapons could break through it, making it notorious for being a place you could never escape from once you got in.Only immediate members of the royal family could freely open and close its doors, and in this situation, imprisoning her there meant that the duke was giving up on his daughter.\u2018How could you do this to me?\u2019Filled with despair, the woman was led underground by her cold-hearted father. A fishy smell pervaded the cold, musty air. Entering a prison for the first time in her life was more than terrifying. But the most terrifying part was the Room of Shadows, which was shrouded in darkness.The woman decided to try her luck before entering the cell.\u201cFather, I really\u2026\u201d\u201cGo in.\u201dAlthough she had called out to him in distress, an icy voice met her. The woman felt an indescribable amount of pain as her tears trickled down her cheeks and splattered onto the ground.\u2018I\u2019ve really been abandoned.\u2019At that moment, her father reached into his coat to secretly hand her something before pushing her into the cell.\u201cEndure.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Reborn Into a VillainessWhen the door closed, keeping out his stony voice, a bright light formed a circle and a geometric pattern appeared. It was a powerful enchantment used to block the entrance.After confirming what her father had given her, the woman was seized by misery and desperation.\u2018Why did you give me this? Do you want me to kill myself?\u2019As the cold air inside the cell settled on her skin, so did the reality of his abandonment. The woman clutched the dagger her father had given her and cried silently.After some time passed, a stranger approached the woman, who was now fatigued by frustration and misery. As a direct descendant of the royal family, he could freely enter the cell. The prince, who was dressed in black armor, was renowned as a bloodthirsty war fanatic.\u201cI came to interrogate the sinner who harmed my sister. Get out of my way,\u201d he commanded the guards.Although he had a bad relationship with his half-sister, it was unlikely that this man was here to save her. He probably wanted to torture her, as he was known to enjoy torturing people.The appearance of the prince who was clad head to toe in black armor, as the rumors described him to be, made the woman even more afraid.As she trembled in fear, the guards spoke cautiously. \u201cY-Your Highness. We apologize, but the emperor, His Majesty, has not yet approved interrogations.\u201dThe prince laughed abruptly. The sound was so terrifying that even the guards trembled.\u201cWhy, do you think I will kill her?\u201dThere was a brief silence. It was a wordless affirmation.Eventually, the prince spoke again. \u201cShall I chop off your heads first before interrogating her?\u201dWhen the guards pressed their lips into a thin line, he laughed. \u201cThe prisoner will only tell the truth if she suffers extreme pain on the verge of death.\u201dHe turned to the woman. \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t kill you.\u201dHis calm voice, which uttered such cruel words, heightened the woman\u2019s fears.\u2018Will he torture me until I die?\u2019It was rumored that the prince had not only slaughtered numerous enemy soldiers at the border but had also killed many enemy retainers. He was truly an insane tyrant in the making. It was terrifying that such a man came to interrogate her.\u2018It might be better to die than be tortured by someone like him.\u2019As her rationality became paralyzed by frustration and fear, her last memory with her father came to mind. She wanted to be loved, but he had handed her a dagger.\u2018It\u2019s rather good that this happened. Someone like me\u2026\u2019The woman replayed the countless insults she had received until now: The only disgrace of Duke Floyen, the good-for-nothing that everyone avoided\u2026She picked up the dagger and laughed hollowly.\u2018It\u2019s better for me to just disappear.\u2019The prince noticed something strange was happening and hurriedly reached out.\u201cStop!\u201dBut it was too late: She had already plunged the dagger into her chest. Just like that, the woman took her own life.This was the point where the online novel stopped updating.\u2018Ah, it would\u2019ve been nice if there was an ending to the story\u2026\u2019After all, the real culprit was never uncovered.I sighed with frustration.\u201cJubelian.\u201dJubelian Eloy Floyen was the name of the villainess in the novel; The unadaptable villainess who always frustrated me.\u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201dIt was shameless of the man to speak without a hint of remorse.\u2018I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s the only thing he has to say after making someone wait for three hours.\u2019A voice likewise scolded the man. \u201cI see that you\u2019re three hours late.\u201dHis face reddened with embarrassment before cooling down.\u201cJubelian.\u201d He called the name again with a lower voice.This was a natural reaction. It must have been the first time she had spoken against him.\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201dFrom being a reader of the novel\u2026 I somehow became the villainess Jubelian, who died after being abandoned by the male lead.Act 1. Successful Breakup?In my previous life, I was an ordinary college student who suffered from a lack of job opportunities.I admit that I read novels in my spare time, but I lived rather diligently: I worked at a part-time job, gained relevant experience for my dream career, and obtained various certificates for programming, as well as for random things that would have qualified me to become a tea sommelier or bakery technician.However, all of this was in vain. If I had known that I would be hit by a car on my way to my part-time job, I would have invested a little more time for myself.I actually often daydreamed about being reincarnated into a character of the upper-class. But I never thought I would be a villainess, especially one destined to have a short life like Jubelian.Usually, reincarnated people I have read about try to avoid their untimely death. However, my behavior so far has been faithful to the original work.\u2018It would have been nice if I realized I was in this novel earlier.\u2019This was because I only remembered the details of Jubelian\u2019s life later on. On my second anniversary of dating Mikhail, three days ago, I suddenly remembered that she used to harass him. I also remembered that other people\u2019s accusations, which led to my death, were corroborated by such behavior.\u2018I used to persistently harass anyone who approached Mikhail.\u2019In the past, Jubelian threw tantrums and cursed at people who simply tried to strike a conversation with him. There have also been numerous instances where threats were made under her family name.\u2018This definitely wasn\u2019t normal.\u2019Because of these events, Jubelian, who was now me, had many enemies.Fortunately, I was at the point in the novel where I had not yet collided with other important characters, such as the princess and the crown prince.\u2018I need to fix my behavior now.\u2019I sighed at the face of my grim future.At that moment, I heard a deep voice speak with an annoyed tone. \u201cAre you angry because I\u2019m late?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Goodbye, Old Love. Hello, New Life!I became puzzled by his question.\u2018Have I ever been angry with him? I don\u2019t think so.\u2019Mikhail was Jubelian\u2019s love of her life and the novel\u2019s male lead. But now that I saw him, my heart was terribly still. A despondent feeling rose inside of me.\u2018I used to be so infatuated with him, but I feel nothing now.\u2019In the past, Jubelian treated Mikhail like her savior. She longed for his love and hung on his every word. At the slightest change of his expression, she became anxious and was constantly afraid that he might leave her as well.However, my experiences in the modern world changed Jubelian\u2019s personality completely. I had to take care of tuition costs, keep my grades up, look for jobs, and pay living expenses all by myself.\u2018I don\u2019t need someone to be my savior. I can change my future myself.\u2019After coming to this conclusion, I opened my mouth.\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201dI simply didn\u2019t want to waste any more time and feelings on him.\u201cJubelian.\u201d Mikhail stared at me with a slightly annoyed expression.Although our relationship had been forcefully started, it had endured two years nonetheless. I could understand the weight of his words just by listening to the tone of his voice.\u201cIf you pursue small matters this way, isn\u2019t it possible to have problems in our relationship?\u201dIt was not a request but a thinly veiled warning. He was telling me to stop bothering him.I smiled innocently like I always did. Except this time, I was being sincere.\u201cI\u2019m not angry. I was joking when I scolded you for being late.\u201d I spoke pleasantly to lighten the mood, but it seemed like he was displeased by my response.He stared at me with a serious expression.\u201cA joke? That doesn\u2019t seem like something you would do.\u201d He huffed and observed me with weary eyes. \u201cSo, why did you call me here?\u201dI sighed upon seeing the blatant displeasure on his face.\u2018Well, I guess he can\u2019t help but be upset. The past Jubelian often interfered with his training.\u2019I decided to let him off the hook this time because of her past mistakes.\u201cMikhail, could you please\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said you only needed me briefly.\u201d He cut me off before I even finished talking.I burst out laughing, but he didn\u2019t look amused.\u201cIf it isn\u2019t anything important, I\u2019ll be going.\u201dMikhail was about to leave first, as usual. It seemed like he was too impatient to be near me any longer. Despite his rude attitude, I knew that nothing good was going to come of making enemies with the novel\u2019s male lead.\u201cIt will only take a minute.\u201d\u201cI have to go now. There\u2019s an important training session I have to attend.\u201dWhen I met his cold gaze, I became irritated.\u2018Ah, this is pathetic! He thinks I\u2019m not even worth five minutes of his time!\u2019Three days ago, I even asked him when he had time for me because I was afraid of interrupting his training. But today, on our promised appointment, I ended up spending three hours in the Imperial Knights\u2019 waiting room. No matter what I did, this man continued to ignore my efforts. He only valued his own time, not mine.\u2018Well, there is no reason for me to endure this any longer.\u2019I set the mood by lowering my voice.\u201cSit down, please. It\u2019ll only take a second.\u201d\u201cI think I already refused.\u201dHis voice was threateningly low as if he thought he was the superior one in this relationship. I felt the urge to break his illusion.\u201cMy father knows that we\u2019re meeting today. Wouldn\u2019t it be odd if you returned early?\u201dMikhail\u2019s expression stiffened when I mentioned my father, who was a boss he both feared and respected.\u201cFive minutes,\u201d he conceded.It seemed that even the strongest knight was afraid of the only Sword Master in the empire. Mikhail sat down in obedience.\u2018Maybe I should have mentioned the duke a little earlier.\u2019I laughed, thinking back to the time I struggled to please the man in front of me.\u2018It was all in vain. There was an easy way out all this time\u2026\u2019At that moment, I heard a stern voice.\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201dMikhail\u2019s expression was filled with annoyance, but it didn\u2019t matter now that I didn\u2019t need his goodwill anymore.\u201cFor the past two years, we\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time together.\u201d I started with a sentimental opening.He probably thought I was trying to seek attention from him because he interrupted me with a low voice.\u201cDid you call me here just to say that?\u201dHe didn\u2019t even let me finish what I had to say and had already lost patience. It seemed that he really hated being with me.\u2018He\u2019s so impatient. I was about to give him a gift too.\u2019Although I was disgruntled by his words, I gave him an insincere smile I had learned from working at my part-time job.\u201cYou won\u2019t be busy anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dI frowned at his attitude.\u2018He\u2019s being too much.\u2019I honestly wanted to tell him, \u2018I\u2019m going to tell my father about this, and he\u2019ll fire you.\u2019\u00a0He knows about Jubelian\u2019s powerful background too, and this would teach him a lesson about what power could do. However, my father would never fire a subordinate he cared about. If Mikhail and I came to despise each other, it would only end badly for me.\u2018Let\u2019s not make enemies anymore. My goal is to live a long life.\u2019I slowly spoke as I reaffirmed this decision in my mind.\u201cI\u2019m saying that I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Goodbye, Old Love. Hello, New Life!At my words, his eyes widened before slowly turning back to normal. Even the corner of his lips tilted as if he couldn\u2019t believe me.\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing. Do you really think I\u2019ll believe that?\u201dI sighed at his wary attitude.Well then, it would be a waste of time to say any more.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether to believe it or not. I already said what I needed to say.\u201dI turned around, but a cold voice stopped me in my tracks.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll trust you. Just don\u2019t appear in front of me ever again.\u201dThe corners of my mouth quirked up at his unexpected words.\u2018I guess the breakup was successful?\u2019Whatever his reason was, he accepted it. I felt relieved.Now my goal was to enjoy life to the fullest extent. Although Father was indifferent towards me, he didn\u2019t mind supporting the luxurious life I gained from being his daughter. It wouldn\u2019t be bad to live happily while spending his money.My spirits increased as I imagined a bright future. I glanced back at Mikhail and smiled.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything that\u2019s happened until now. I wish you happiness.\u201dAfter bidding him farewell sincerely, I turned around.When I used to meet Mikhail, I usually wore pretty but uncomfortable shoes. The ones I wore today were plain and low-heeled.Was it thanks to these comfortable shoes that I was able to leave without regrets?* * *\u2018She said she\u2019s sorry for everything?\u2019Mikhail scoffed while staring at the woman\u2019s retreating figure.\u2018Bullshit. It must be a ploy to get my attention.\u2019He was certain that the woman would turn around again and come back to him. But contrary to his expectations, she continued to walk away without sparing him another glance. When she finally left the waiting room, he clenched his fists.\u2018Was she being serious?\u2019Jubelian Eloy Floyen.She was undoubtedly beautiful, despite suffering from an illness of the mind. For the past two years, he had endured her behavior, which she had excused in the name of love. The woman followed him wherever he went. She showed hostility to the people he spoke to and was overjoyed if he gave her even a little attention. She was like a dog; A stupid dog who wagged her tail even when pushed away and showed affection even when her master did not.Although it was very annoying, he tolerated her because of the attention he received from her father and his idol, Duke Floyen.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Mikhail,\u201d the duke had said when they first met.In addition, he was relieved that other annoying women didn\u2019t bother him when she was with him.\u2018Why did she suddenly change her mind?\u2019Plagued with uncertainty, Mikhail clenched his fists unconsciously. Now that the woman was now completely out of sight, he unexpectedly felt strange instead of relieved.\u2018It\u2019s a relief I won\u2019t have to see that troublesome woman anymore.\u2019Mikhail tried to focus on this mindset to shake off conflicting thoughts, but\u2026\u201cDamn it.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her.Her words continued to play in his mind: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything until now. I wish you happiness.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t forget her smile either. She even looked a little relieved.* * *\u2018Ah, it feels like the knot in the pit of my stomach has been unraveled. I\u2019ll go up to my room and rest now.\u2019I had just come home after parting with Mikhail. It was then I ran into a handsome man by the front door. I had inherited his silver hair and blue eyes, but not his striking appearance. Because he was a transcendent being who aged slowly, it seemed like we could be siblings.\u2018There may be a day when I\u2019ll look older than this person.\u2019\u201cFather, how was your day?\u201d I greeted him with an upbeat voice, which was the complete opposite of how I felt inside.He stared at me with indifference. Although we were family, it had been many years since I greeted him like this.\u201cDo not come here again,\u201d he had told me once.After being turned away, I only talked to him when it concerned important business. But now I had a reason to pretend to be friendly to him.\u2018I just want to live happily.\u2019After retrieving the memories of my previous life, I realized an important fact: No matter how much I begged for his love, my father would eventually abandon me. In addition to being lacking in many ways, I was nothing more than a shameful existence that he never mentioned to other people. Since I wasn\u2019t going to be loved by him anyway, I would give up and find my happiness elsewhere.\u2018Yes, the happiness of money!\u2019Of course, I had a conscience, so I didn\u2019t intend to be greedy. A small estate in the outskirts of the city, some money from my father, and a job handling one of his countless responsibilities would be enough.\u2018In fact, I would still be living a luxurious life even with only those things.\u2019I had no intention of begging for my father\u2019s love anymore. But as long as I needed his money, it was important to maintain a proper relationship. If I didn\u2019t get along with him like in the original novel, I might end up with not even a penny.I showed him an insincere smile that I learned from working in retail.\u201cYou must be tired from supervising training all day.\u201dOnce again, he didn\u2019t answer.\u2018My God! Would it kill him to say a word?\u2019His behavior brought me into a foul mood like it would any other human being. Even so, I was used to being ignored by him.\u201cYou should go and relax. I will go up, too.\u201d I hurriedly finished the one-sided conversation and started climbing the stairs to the second floor.It was then I heard him speak.\u201cThere was no training today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Walking on EggshellsI doubted having heard anything at all when an unfamiliar voice reached my ears.\u2018Huh? My father responded to me.\u2019It had been a long time since I heard him speak. I was taken aback for a second before coming back to my senses. When I realized what he had just said, I gritted my teeth.\u2018Mikhail, that bastard! He said he had to hurry back because of training. He lied to me!\u2019Upon realizing this, I became even more irked. I felt the urge to swear at Mikhail for how he had treated me but quickly controlled my emotions.\u2018Calm down, Jubelian. He\u2019s no longer in my life. Let\u2019s be cool about this.\u2019Although this was my second life, the part-time experiences in my first life had taught me not to get worked up so quickly. I recalled a time I had to deal with an annoying customer, and controlled my expression.\u201cYou came home early today,\u201d my father said.\u2018Ah, now that I think about it\u2026\u2019In the past, Jubelian used to come home late because she was busy following Mikhail. But since I had broken up with him today and come home straight away, I was back much earlier than usual.\u2018Should I tell him the truth?\u2019Similar to the original story, my father seemed to hold Mikhail in high regard. He often made things convenient for him and treated him with relative kindness. Since I was useless as his only child, he may have been thinking about making Mikhail his successor.I burst out laughing.If I was anything like the past Jubelian, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell him the truth. I would\u2019ve been too afraid that he might hate me for making a mistake. However, I had learned something from Jubelian\u2019s past; trying to be loved by my father was futile.I stared at his blue eyes, which were similar to mine, and spit out. \u201cWe parted ways.\u201dAlthough I didn\u2019t mention Mikhail\u2019s name, he probably knew who I was referring to. The creases in his face proved this.\u201cWhy?\u201d It was a short question laden with discontent.I understood why he asked me this. If Mikhail became his son-in-law, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the succession issue. But now that we had broken up, I had ruined his plans. Even so, it was a two-person relationship that I had to take care of myself.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to spend my life with someone who didn\u2019t have feelings for me.\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, his face crumpled with horror. It seemed like he was astonished that I had broken up with a man of such talent just because of pride. His narrowed eyes seemed to reproach me. Although my heart tightened, it didn\u2019t ache. I wasn\u2019t a child who could become hurt by his words anymore.\u201cI simply want to get married to someone who will love me, Father. I want to be happy.\u201dActually, I considered being single for the rest of my life but thought it would be better to hide my intentions. If I offended him even more, he might hand me a dagger like he did in the original novel. I didn\u2019t realize this before, but I knew now; constant indifference was better than cruel abandonment.\u2018I\u2019ll live quietly without bothering you, so please leave me alone like you always did.\u2019I would\u2019ve cried at such a thought in the past, but now I didn\u2019t feel sad at all. It was as if all of my emotions dried up. I stared at my father as he turned around without a response.\u2018Does that mean that he doesn\u2019t want to talk to his pathetic daughter anymore?\u2019He had ignored me plenty of times before, so I wasn\u2019t offended. I stared at his retreating back and sighed in relief.\u2018Ah, I\u2019m going to go up to my room and rest.\u2019I felt very tired because a lot of things had happened today.* * *Jubelian\u2019s maid, Merilyn, gulped nervously.\u2018The reins that used to keep Lady Floyen occupied are gone now\u2026\u2019She had been able to breathe these past few days because Jubelian had been in a good mood. But it was a different story now that she had broken up with Mikhail. The news was both sudden and unexpected.\u2018I\u2019m in trouble now.\u2019Jubelian, otherwise known as Lady Floyen, was a very beautiful woman. It was rewarding to help dress her in beautiful clothes and accessories, but her emotional ups and downs made Merilyn\u2019s job very difficult. She would freely scream and curse when she felt upset. When she broke an expensive tea set or ripped her clothes in anger, all the maids would become extremely anxious. They were terrified that they might be treated like that one day.Merilyn spoke carefully to avoid provoking Jubelian.\u201cI will help you change out of your clothes, Lady Floyen.\u201dJubelian\u2019s bright eyes, which shined like sapphires, looked at her indifferently. Merilyn gulped nervously.\u2018Did I say something wrong?\u2019In that moment, a subtle smile appeared on Jubelian\u2019s face. Merilyn\u2019s gaze fixated on her smile, almost as if she was possessed.\u2018She\u2019s beautiful when she smiles.\u2019Merilyn was still blankly staring at the Jubelian\u2019s face when she heard her speak.\u201cWhy are you standing still, Merilyn? I thought you said you would help me change out of my clothes.\u201dHer lady\u2019s smile was gone. Merilyn came to her senses, and realizing what she had done, turned pale with fear.\u2018What do I do? I think I just got on her nerves!\u2019Perspiration formed around her neck and her insides turned cold. She couldn\u2019t find the courage to lift her head.At that moment, she heard a clear voice speak over her bowed head.\u201cActually Merilyn, you don\u2019t have to help me. Just prepare a bath for me please.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - Walking on EggshellsJubelian\u2019s tone made her doubt herself. It didn\u2019t seem like she was irritated or angry. Merilyn stared at the beautiful lady with suspicion. When their eyes met, a brilliant smile blossomed on Jubelian\u2019s face like a flower.\u201cAh, and please prepare some bath products that will help me sleep. I am tired and want to go to bed early.\u201d\u201cY-yes. I will prepare lavender scented ones.\u201d Although she stuttered, she was able to compose herself and reply in time.\u2018Why is Lady Floyen suddenly acting like this? I can\u2019t get used to it\u2026\u2019If anyone asked Merilyn what she thought of the lady, she would say that Lady Floyen was an unfavorable person to serve without hesitation. Although she had never physically abused her maids, she had done plenty of psychological harm.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for the bath then. Thank you.\u201dJubelian, who had finished their brief conversation with grace, walked past Merilyn and entered her room. She had given her an encouraging remark rather than a spiteful one. Merilyn glanced at the closed door, then staggered when her legs lost their strength.\u201cMerilyn! Are you okay?\u201dSella, an assistant maid, rushed towards her. Merilyn refused her help.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I will prepare a bath for Lady Floyen. Please prepare some clothes for her.\u201dMerilyn tried to calm herself after giving instructions to Sella.\u2018I thought she would be angry\u2026 She\u2019s acting very strange today.\u2019The Jubelian she knew would throw tantrums when she wasn\u2019t in a good mood, which would ruin everyone else\u2019s mood in turn.\u2018It\u2019s as if she\u2019s become a completely different person.\u2019The moment she thought of this, goosebumps pricked her skin. Merilyn struggled to compose herself.\u2018Let\u2019s not think useless thoughts. I just need to do my job well.\u2019Nevertheless, Jubelian\u2019s smiling face continued to plague her.\u2018Is it because she didn\u2019t seem energetic? I even felt sorry for her.\u2019At this thought, Merilyn let out a sigh and slapped herself in the face.\u2018What am I thinking about? Wake up, Merilyn.\u2019She reminded herself to stay vigilant in front of the Lady.* * *Taking a bath was always an enjoyable experience. Useless thoughts would scatter the moment I soaked myself in warm, fragrant water. However, I was so tired from today\u2019s events that even a bath didn\u2019t seem appealing.\u2018Should I just skip it?\u2019I had been thinking about just going to sleep for a while now but quickly decided against it.\u2018No, they must be doing their best to prepare it. I shouldn\u2019t change my mind at the last minute.\u2019I felt sad after realizing that I had been so cruel to the maids. I wished I could start over from the beginning, but it was already too late. Even if I showed kindness to them now, they probably wouldn\u2019t think it was sincere.Now that I decided to be a nice lady from now on, I continued to wait for my bath to be ready. Despite my determination, I couldn\u2019t stop yawning.\u2018I\u2019m really about to pass out. What should I do?\u2019After waiting for another five minutes, I began thinking about cancelling the bath. Just then, I heard a knock.\u201cThe bath is ready, Lady Floyen.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dI rose from my chair to go to the washroom. However, I was so sleepy that I kept resisting the urge to keep yawning. When I finally gave in, tears began to flow down my cheeks.\u2018Ah, I\u2019m really, really sleepy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to take a bath like this\u2026\u2019I raised my hand to wipe my tears and heard a voice.\u201cLady Floyen!\u201dMerilyn was in the room watching me with astonishment, which was quite an unusual look on her.\u2018Oh no, did she just see me yawning?\u2019I probably looked like a hippo with my mouth wide open.\u2018Well, that\u2019s embarrassing.\u2019I smiled as gracefully as possible while trying my best to keep my lips shut.\u201cSorry about that. Did I look bad?\u201dLike a professional, Merilyn didn\u2019t say anything about me yawning.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she merely asked with a careful tone.\u2018I\u2019m just going to be honest with her since she\u2019s asking me like that.\u2019I guess I really looked tired in her eyes since she asked me if I would be okay to take a bath. I decided to tell her the truth.A few tears leaked from the corner of my eyes as I said, \u201cI\u2019m really tired, so I\u2019ll take the bath tomorrow. Could you change me into my sleepwear?\u201dMerilyn nodded silently and began helping me into my clothes. For some reason, she bore a sullen expression.\u2018Maybe\u2026 it\u2019s because I made her prepare the bath for no reason.\u2019I had heard somewhere before that it\u2019s easier to see things from someone\u2019s shoes if you\u2019ve been in a similar situation before. Maybe it was because of what I had experienced at my part-time jobs, but I felt sorry for Merilyn who suffered all this time under the previous Jubelian.\u201cIt\u2019s because\u2026 I\u2019m very tired right now.\u201dMerilyn\u2019s eyes widened at my excuse. She hurriedly lowered her head.\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Please rest.\u201dShe was probably still upset, despite pretending that everything was okay.\u201cThank you, Merilyn.\u201dHer legs seemed to wobble for a second, but I was so tired that it must\u2019ve been an illusion. As soon as Merilyn left the room, I collapsed on my bed.\u2018Ah, did I really end things with Mikhail today?\u2019I felt so happy that my body shook with laughter.\u2018What a relief!\u2019Although I felt sorry for Merilyn who was probably upset by what I did tonight\u2026 I had at least successfully broken up with Mikhail. Because of that, I could sleep soundly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Out Shopping With My FatherLate into the night, long after the moon had risen in the sky, the maids were chatting secretly in a garden full of white roses.\u201cAh, I had a difficult day today.\u201d\u201cSame here\u2026 By the way, where\u2019s Merilyn?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s probably being scolded by Lady Floyen.\u201dAt that moment, Merilyn appeared in front of them.\u201cMerilyn!\u201dThe maids approached her with anxious expressions and bombarded her with questions.\u201cHow was your day?\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201dAt Sella\u2019s question, Merilyn recalled what happened recently and sighed.\u2018She pretended to be okay\u2026 but\u2026\u2019Although Jubelian had tried to hide her emotions, Merilyn could see the tears brimming in her indigo eyes. The lady wore an awkward expression and a forced, almost embarrassed smile. Jubelian had frequently bullied the maids, but seeing her like that made Merilyn feel sympathetic towards her.\u201cNo, there was some crying.\u201dAt Merilyn\u2019s words, the maids widened their eyes in astonishment. They began to criticize Jubelian.\u201cLady Floyen is really too much!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. She should\u2019ve taken it out on Sir Mikhail, not you, Merilyn.\u201dMerilyn massaged her temples. It seemed like the maids had misunderstood her, seeing as they were trying to console her.\u201cNo, not me. Lady Floyen was crying.\u201dOne of the maids, who had asked if Jubelian had thrown something at Merilyn, became startled by her words. Her rabbit-like eyes widened with surprise.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI went into her room after preparing the bath and saw her crying in secret.\u201dAll the maids frowned with suspicion. They knew what kind of person Jubelian was. It was difficult to believe what Merilyn had just said.\u201cDid she really?\u201d\u201cIt seems like the breakup affected her greatly. She looked very lethargic tonight as well.\u201dSilence pervaded the solemn atmosphere before a man\u2019s voice broke the silence.\u201cShe cried?\u201dAt his sudden interruption, all the maids jolted with surprise.\u201cM-master!\u201dDuke Floyen, the owner of the estate, stared at them with a stony expression. The maids trembled with fear. After being caught red-handed for talking about Jubelian, they had no excuses for being punished.\u201cYou.\u201dThe duke\u2019s peacock-blue eyes fell on Merilyn.Merilyn held her breath as she waited for her master to continue speaking.\u201cTell me in detail what you saw,\u201d he commanded in a cold voice.* * *When I woke up, my body felt lighter than it had yesterday.\u2018Ah, I think today will be a good day.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to spend my days as a homebody for a while. My plan was to eat a lot of delicious food and live in seclusion. However, this plan was only as good as a wish. For some reason, my father asked me to have breakfast with him this morning.\u201cHow is the food?\u201d\u2018The food is good of course. It\u2019s your presence that will make me sick, Father.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201dI couldn\u2019t express the full truth; all I could do was eagerly eat after giving a short response.\u2018I must quickly finish this so I can go back up to my room.\u2019I practically inhaled the food, despite finding it a bit burdensome for a light breakfast.\u201cEat slowly. You\u2019ll get sick.\u201dMy father was staring at me. He looked at me like how one would look at something pathetic.\u2018But you\u2019re the one who\u2019s making me sick\u2026\u2019I was already shocked that he had suddenly called me for breakfast. He was only making it worse by staring at me as I ate.\u2018Why is he doing this? Is he silently scolding me for breaking up with Mikhail?\u2019I wanted to leave the dining room as soon as possible, but doing so would only reveal my discomfort. I continued to force food down my throat. Before long, my father looked away from me and sighed.\u2018He probably thinks I\u2019m pathetic. Well, it makes sense.\u2019My father bore the great title of duke. He also led an elite group of the Imperial Knights and the entire Central army. After leading the war that took place 20 years ago to a great victory, he became the empire\u2019s most revered hero and strongest swordsman.\u2018He has everything.\u2019In addition, my father was also a very handsome man. He still receives marriage proposals these days.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped if he thinks I\u2019m pathetic.\u2019My father was a character who had it all. I wasn\u2019t a merely mediocre comparison, but a pathetic one. Not only was I untalented, but my social reputation also plummeted as I chased Mikhail around. I didn\u2019t even have any friends because of my poor social skills.\u2018In other novels, villainesses are still popular among their social circles no matter how they behave\u2026 This character is somewhat realistic.\u2019I was unconsciously sulking when I made eye contact with my father again.\u201cDo you want this?\u201dHe must\u2019ve thought I was looking at the plate of food in front of him. I shook my head, but a large chunk of meat already landed on my plate.\u201cEat.\u201dDespite being full, I couldn\u2019t refuse what my father had given me.\u2018Why are you doing this to me?\u2019As I silently suffered from overeating, he suddenly called out my name.\u201cJubelian.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat is your ideal type?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Out Shopping With My FatherI dropped my fork at the unexpected question.\u2018Why on earth is he asking this question?\u2019A servant in the dining room replaced my fork with a new one, but I was so shocked that I felt like I was going to drop it again.\u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201dAlthough it was a simple question, it didn\u2019t make sense coming from him, considering how he had treated me these past 18 years.\u2018He was never interested in me, so why is he asking this now?\u2019An uneasy thought suddenly occurred to me.\u2018No way, is he trying to marry me off to someone else? He must really want a successor.\u2019It was a credible hypothesis. As his only child, I didn\u2019t qualify as a successor to who he could pass down his title.\u2018I\u2019d rather have a stepmother and a half-brother than get married!\u2019After quickly thinking about what his question meant, I mentioned something that was probably impossible in this world.\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe a man stronger than you, Father?\u201dHe murmured something to himself, then stared at me.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he asked in a cold voice.Upon hearing his voice and meeting his icy eyes, I realized that I had made a mistake. There was no one stronger than my father in the empire. To not annoy him any further, I hurriedly changed my answer.\u201c\u2026 I mean, that would be nice, but there\u2019s no such person in this world, right? Father is the strongest swordsman in the empire!\u201dHis expression softened at my praise.\u2018It\u2019s really hard to please him\u2026\u2019\u201cSo, what\u2019s your final answer?\u201dI had hoped to move on to a different topic, but it seemed that he had no intention of doing so.\u2018I need to mention someone with near-impossible conditions without annoying him.\u2019After all, no other family possessed higher prestige than the Floyen household. Even if he introduced a man for me to marry, I could just say that he doesn\u2019t fit our family\u2019s standards and dismiss him.Having cleared up my thoughts, I looked at my father with a determined expression and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry a man unless he has everything. I want the most wealthy, famous, and competent man there is.\u201dI snuck in the possibility that I wasn\u2019t going to marry and observed his expression for any changes. His face stayed the same, making it hard for me to guess what he was thinking about.After a long silence, he finally spoke.\u201cI see.\u201dIt seemed like I had convinced him. I sighed in relief.\u2018I\u2019m so tired. Just a little while longer, then I can go back to my room.\u2019I felt uncomfortable spending time with my father, so I desperately waited for breakfast to end.\u201cJubelian.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI was a little nervous about what he might say next. But this time, I was ready to answer.\u2018No matter what you ask, I\u2019ll answer it.\u2019His lips slowly parted.\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere together.\u201dI dropped my fork for the second time, startled by his out-of-the-blue question.\u201cGo somewhere?\u201dI searched through 18 years of Jubelian\u2019s memories to see if I had ever accompanied my father anywhere, but nothing came up.\u201cWhy?\u201dWhen I responded to his unexpected offer, he said calmly, \u201cJust because.\u201dBewildered by his brief answer, I felt a dull ache in my head.\u2018Why are you doing this to me, Father?\u2019* * *We ended up going to Arcade Street. There was a high-end shopping mall here, similar to modern shopping malls where several stores gather under one roof.\u201cThat.\u201dMy father pointed to a strange-looking owl watch. The clerk guiding us called out to someone.\u201cNeil, add the owl watch!\u201dI sighed with frustration. My head throbbed, so I briefly closed my eyes.\u2018I don\u2019t understand. Why the hell is he doing this?\u2019When I opened my eyes, I tried to not let my gaze linger on any one object for too long. But as I walked past a myriad of stores, a porcelain rabbit caught my eyes.\u2018That\u2019s very expensive.\u2019In my previous life, ceramics were commonly used. But in this world, it was a high-quality item that only a few people could afford. That\u2019s why ceramic figures in the form of animals, flowers, and people were envied by many people.\u2018It\u2019s a shame. I don\u2019t think it looks that lovely\u2026\u2019Around us, onlookers raved about its beauty. But the various pigments that colored the porcelain rabbit looked messy and bizarre.\u2018I don\u2019t understand why people would pay a lot of money for this.\u2019At that moment, I felt a burdensome gaze behind me and quickly directed my attention elsewhere.\u2018Ugh, not again\u2026\u2019Although I had been determined to not look at any one object for too long, I had been staring at this bizarre object for a while. As I dwelled on my mistake, I heard my father speak.\u201cThat one as well.\u201dHe pointed at the porcelain rabbit.I frowned with frustration.\u2018Why does he keep buying things I\u2019m looking at?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - An Impolite StrangerI thought this would just be a simple outing, but my father was buying everything I laid my eyes on.\u2018This is uncomfortable.\u2019Although shopping was an inevitable part of my new life, I didn\u2019t want to lavishly spend money without careful consideration. I liked to buy things that were to my liking.\u2018Is he testing me to see how I behave when I run out of patience?\u2019All I wanted to do was to return home, but reality was that I was the duke\u2019s daughter. My dependence on my father meant that I couldn\u2019t rebel against his will, otherwise, it would only bring me trouble.\u2018This is all my fault for not creating means to be independent of him.\u2019I sighed. Something suddenly appeared in front of my face. It was the bizarre porcelain rabbit I saw.\u2018If I break it and pretend it was a mistake\u2026 will I be scolded?\u2019I accepted the rabbit without a choice. My father looked at me.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dFor some reason, his expression was more relaxed than before. If someone he knew had seen him, they might\u2019ve even asked if he had good news.\u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s pleased to have annoyed me\u2026 or is he?\u2019I sighed and glanced at all the things he bought. Perhaps he was the type to relieve stress by shopping. I followed him without a word, careful not to put him in a bad mood.Then, something caught my eye again. This time, it was a person.\u2018She\u2019s carrying a sword.\u2019The empire had clear-cut gender roles, so it was difficult to find swordswomen. As such, she couldn\u2019t help but stand out.\u2018I know that the steady stream of swordswomen stopped after Sir Yulia, the first empress\u2019s captain of guards, went missing\u2026\u2019People around us began murmuring, but I thought that it would be nice to see more women wielding swords again. At that moment, my father also caught sight of the swordswoman and stopped in his tracks.\u201cWait here for a minute.\u201dHe approached the woman everyone was looking at.\u2018Does he know her?\u2019When they disappeared into the crowd, people\u2019s conversations shifted.\u201cWas that person Duke Floyen?\u201dThey were whispering, but I could still hear them. I felt uncomfortable with all the unwelcome gazes on me.\u2018I just want to rest at a quiet place\u2026\u2019I cautiously stepped away from the crowd, but my movements were noticed by Geraldine, my escort knight. He was also my older cousin.\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, Jubelian?\u201dI frowned at Geraldine, who was looking at me with suspicion. He must\u2019ve thought I was planning on making mischief.\u201cThere are many people here. You should speak with respect, Sir Geraldine.\u201dHe sulked at my remark, but quickly composed himself in embarrassment.\u201cSo where are you going, Lady Jubelian?\u201d he asked more respectfully this time.\u201cI want to buy something from that shop.\u201dGeraldine\u2019s expression hardened when I carelessly pointed to a lonesome shop at the corner of the street.\u201cIs that really\u2026 where you want to go?\u201dHe spoke in a strange tone, so I turned around to look at the shop and flinched.The sign read \u201cGrowling Bear Armor Specialty Shop\u201d.\u2018Ugh\u2026 why did I point to a place like that?\u2019Just as I was regretting my actions, Geraldine said sarcastically, \u201cI will respect the lady\u2019s wishes.\u201dUnable to change my decision now, I simply nodded and answered, \u201cThank you.\u201dI entered the store with Geraldine and was greeted by an owner who possessed the physique of a bear.\u201cWelcome to\u2026 huh? An angel in our store?\u201dAlthough the shop was mostly empty, I was still embarrassed at his exaggerated praise.\u201cOh, I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\u2018I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t need anything if I\u2019m here\u2026\u2019I glanced at Geraldine, but he was already distracted by something else.\u201cOh, I love this gauntlet!\u201d he gushed.\u2018He\u2019s here to protect me, but he\u2019s just shopping for his own stuff.\u2019\u201cPrice?\u201dAlthough he had only spit out a single word, his cold and desolate voice made me tremble. I peeked to the side inconspicuously and saw a man wearing a black cloak that covered his entire body. His face was likewise covered with a hood.\u2018He looks a little suspicious\u2026\u2019\u201cTen silver coins, sir!\u201dIn response to the owner\u2019s lively voice, the man searched through his pocket.\u2018He\u2019s so tall. I can also tell he\u2019s a handsome guy just by looking at his nose\u2026\u2019At that moment, red eyes that I could barely make out under his hood turned to me. I hurriedly avoided his gaze but not before our eyes briefly met.\u2018Well, this is embarrassing\u2026 I should apologize, right?\u2019At that moment, I heard him speak in a distasteful tone.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u2018Wow, he\u2019s so rude.\u2019It was true that I had stolen a glance at him first and displayed bad manners, but I didn\u2019t want to apologize to someone who spoke so impolitely to a stranger.\u201cOh, um\u2026 I was looking for the thing you\u2019re buying right now.\u201dWhen I answered, the owner stiffened.\u201cMiss, you want to\u2026 buy this?\u201d\u2018Wait a minute, is that armor polish?\u2019I tried to maintain a serious expression when I realized what I was looking at. Knights were usually associated with armor, but in reality, they didn\u2019t have to wear them unless they were fighting in a war. In other words, armor polish was useless to me.\u201cYes, I need it!\u201d I declared loudly anyway. I didn\u2019t want to admit that I had been secretly looking at the cloaked man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - An Impolite Stranger\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the decorative armors in my house have lost their luster.\u201dThe owner nodded to my answer.\u201cOf course, but one would not be enough to shine everything in a house.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, I just need one\u2026\u201dI tried to refuse him, but it seemed like the owner didn\u2019t hear me. He continued to speak.\u201cWait here. I\u2019ll go through the warehouse to find more!\u201dAfter the owner had disappeared, it sunk in that I had purchased something out of impulse.\u2018I just bought useless armor polish\u2026 I can\u2019t criticize Father when I\u2019m doing the same thing.\u2019I sighed, thinking that I had dug my own grave. The man next to me placed a gold coin on the table, picked up his polish, and turned around. I would have ignored him if he had placed down a small amount of money. However, a gold coin was an enormous value. This amount could feed a commoner\u2019s family for two weeks.\u201cHey, what about change?\u201d I shouted after him loudly and clearly, but he didn\u2019t respond.\u201cChange!\u201d I followed him and shouted even louder.He should\u2019ve been able to hear me and I began to wonder if he was deaf. Maybe he had heard the wrong amount from the owner. I suddenly felt sorry for him.\u201cHey, can you hear me?\u201d I asked again.At that moment, the man stopped in his tracks. He turned around and stared at me.\u2018Okay, so he\u2019s not deaf.\u2019Despite my embarrassment for causing a commotion, I said, \u201cI think you heard the wrong thing from the owner. The amount you paid is ten times the price.\u201dWhile I was explaining to the man, I heard Geraldine call for me.\u201cMy lady, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 this guy\u2026\u201dI tried to explain the situation, but the man took that opportunity to leave the shop.\u2018Is he just that rich or something?\u2019I was frowning in embarrassment when I heard the owner\u2019s voice again.\u201cHahaha, miss! It turns out that we have ten more of these.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need ten\u2026\u201dI tried telling him that I didn\u2019t need that much, but the owner wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\u201cOne gold coin for all of these! Oh, you have already done the math!\u201dOne gold coin. It was the same amount that the man in the hood had paid before leaving.I tried to clear the misunderstanding with the owner, but he continued to make his own assumptions.\u201cBy the way, did that guy take my stuff without paying?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re mistaken\u2026\u201d\u201cThat damned bastard!\u201dThe owner began to curse at the man. Despite my attempts to interject, I wasn\u2019t able to get a word in until he was finished.\u201cThat one gold coin was paid by him!\u201d I finally burst out.The owner became embarrassed.\u201cIs that so? You should have told me earlier.\u201d\u2018Is this guy really blaming me? I tried to tell him all this time!\u2019In my exasperation, I decided to never step into this shop again.* * *Next to a carriage parked in a vacant lot, a short-haired woman was waiting for someone anxiously.\u2018Where is he?\u2019When the man arrived, she sighed in relief.\u201cMy Lord, I have informed Duke Floyen of your appointment.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dAlthough his voice was cold as usual, he sounded somewhat annoyed. The woman realized this and asked, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cHey, can you hear me?\u201dThe man was thinking about the woman in the shop. She had no fear, even around a vicious dog who bared its teeth to warn people around him to stay away. He had been annoyed for a second, but the moment he turned around and met the woman\u2019s eyes, all hostility disappeared. Reminiscing what had just happened, the young man frowned.\u201cNothing happened.\u201d* * *\u2018Ah, I\u2019m so tired.\u2019I left the shop with frustration. As I walked away, I tried to brainstorm ways I could recover from what had happened today.\u201cWhere have you been, Jubelian?\u201dFor some reason, my father bore a displeased expression. I quickly answered him.\u201cOh, I bought something.\u201dMy father turned to Geraldine, who was carrying the bought goods.\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s armor polish.\u201dAt Geraldine\u2019s answer, my father glanced at me with a slight frown. He then sighed and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u2018I know I bought something useless, but there\u2019s no way he can berate me. If he has a conscience, that is.\u2019I began to follow my father for who knows how long. When an obstacle appeared before my eyes, my composure threatened to crumble.\u2018Ugh, stairs!\u2019I had been following him for several hours today, so my feet throbbed.\u2018I only need to endure this a little while longer.\u2019I tried to ignore the pain by imagining the bright future I was going to have after inheriting my father\u2019s wealth.\u2018Wait, what\u2019s going on?\u2019I suddenly felt a tingling sensation in the back of my head and my eyesight became speckled with black dots. My legs also lost their strength as I tried to take another step.\u201cHelp!\u201dFortunately, I didn\u2019t fall down because I grabbed onto something in front of me.\u2018Whew, I survived.\u2019As soon as my eyesight came back, I looked up to see what I was holding and stiffened with fear.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dAlthough I was tired, I couldn\u2019t believe that I had latched onto my father\u2019s arm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - A Strange Dream\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dTo not ruin my father\u2019s mood, I hurriedly apologized and tried to back away from him.He held onto my wrist.\u201cStay still.\u201dMy field of vision swayed violently as he spoke. The next thing I knew, I was being carried bridal style. I choked in embarrassment.\u201cF-father?\u201d I usually never stuttered but ended up doing so because of our embarrassing display in front of everyone.Instead of answering me, he continued to walk while holding me in his arms.\u201cWe\u2019re going back to the carriage.\u201dI looked up at him, surprised by what he had just said. Icy blue eyes and a twisted expression met me. It seemed like he was annoyed that I had gotten in his way.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Father.\u201dI tried to convince him to put me down, but he ignored me.\u201cQuiet,\u201d he ordered with a cold voice.As he continued to hold me in an embarrassing position, I somehow swallowed my shame.\u2018Why is he acting like this today\u2026\u2019He had also acted strange when we were shopping. Maybe it was due to the stress, but my head was throbbing. I was in so much pain that when my father sat me down on the carriage seat and took off my shoes, I couldn\u2019t say anything.\u2018It hurts.\u2019I felt a stinging sensation around the back of my feet. I must\u2019ve chafed my heels.\u2018I\u2019ll apply some medicine and rest when I get home.\u2019As I tried to endure the pain, I heard a stern voice.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201dIt seemed like my father was in a bad mood because I had ruined his day.\u2018Despite my protests, he still insisted on coming to the carriage.\u2019I tried not to reveal my increasing stress levels.\u201cBecause it\u2019s really not a big deal. Let\u2019s go back to shopping,\u201d I replied calmly. If I pretended to be okay, I hoped he wouldn\u2019t treat me like a useless person.\u2018That should do it, right?\u2019But contrary to my expectations, I heard a voice that was as cold as ice.\u201cWe\u2019re going home.\u201d\u201cWhat? But\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anything useless and stay still.\u201dAt those words, I clamped my mouth shut before releasing a small sigh. Although I had listened to him all day and behaved nicely, his expression didn\u2019t seem so good.\u2018It\u2019s very difficult to make him happy.\u2019I could feel my forehead becoming warmer and my headache worsening.\u2018What\u2019s happening? I feel sick.\u2019As soon as I became conscious of how strange I felt, I heard my father speak.\u201cJubelian.\u201dI turned to him. He sighed and opened his mouth again.\u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll\u2026 a good one\u2026 shopping\u2026 your thoughts\u2026\u201dHow strange. My father\u2019s voice kept cutting off and I couldn\u2019t concentrate on his words properly because of my pounding headache.\u2018Oh well, I\u2019ll just agree to whatever he says.\u2019I nodded along even though I couldn\u2019t hear him well. I didn\u2019t want to keep ruining his mood. My head began to feel awfully heavy, so much so that I couldn\u2019t sit upright anymore. At that moment, I heard him speak again.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201dFortunately, I could hear him clearly this time.\u2018It\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u2019The moment I tried to answer, his eyes widened, as if he was shocked about something.\u201cJubelian?\u201dHe called my name. That was the last thing I heard before my consciousness blackened.* * *A carriage bearing a lily and sword crest that symbolized the Floyen House was spotted in the distance. A butler came outside to greet the approaching carriage and smiled to himself.\u2018I wonder if his date with Lady Floyen went well today. He had been excited about it.\u2019He recalled his master\u2019s serious expression as he questioned the servants about what his daughter liked. The butler tried to suppress his amusement, but laughter couldn\u2019t help but spill from his lips. When the carriage arrived at the mansion and the door opened, he bowed to greet his lord.\u201cWelcome, Master\u2026\u201dWhen he looked up, his smile immediately disappeared and his eyes widened with shock.\u201cL-Lady Floyen!\u201dJubelian, who had turned deathly pale in the arms of his master, looked like a wax doll.\u201cW-what is\u2026\u201dThe butler stuttered, trying to find the right words to say, but was cut short by a fierce voice that snapped him to attention.\u201cDerrick.\u201dPanic reflected in his master\u2019s eyes, but his expression was as steely as a slab of ice.\u201cSummon Allen. Right now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - A Strange DreamIn the past, Jubelian had fallen sick a few times, but it was never severe enough for her father to show up. She used to be sad about this, but now I felt nothing.\u201cWake\u2026 up\u2026\u201dOut of annoyance, I tried to open my eyes to see who was murmuring in my ears. I could barely make out a man with a blurry and distorted face. It didn\u2019t help that my body felt like it was floating in the clouds, giving me no sense of reality.\u201cJubell!\u201dIt was strange. He didn\u2019t have a reason to call me like that or look at me with a face that seemed to be on the verge of tears\u2026\u201cNo, this can\u2019t be. If you\u2019re gone, I\u2026\u201dIt is said that dreams are unconscious expressions of what the dreamer desperately wants.\u201cPlease wake up.\u201dWhat a terrible dream.As soon as I thought that, I sank into the darkness again.* * *When I gained consciousness, I was lying on my bed.\u201cAre you feeling okay, Lady Floyen?\u201dThe first person I saw was Allen, the Floyen House\u2019s family doctor. Only then did I realize that I hadn\u2019t fallen asleep but passed out.\u201cHow long has it been, Allen?\u201d\u201cThree days, my lady.\u201dI observed my surroundings. Maids looked back at me with anxious expressions.\u201cAre you feeling okay, Lady Floyen?\u201d Allen repeated.Merilyn, Julia, and Sella. I counted the maids in my room. My father was nowhere in sight.\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t even expect him to be here in the first place.\u2019He hadn\u2019t shown up to my debutante ball either.At that moment, the door opened. Allen brightened and ushered the person to come inside.I turned around to check if it was Derrick, our butler. I widened my eyes with surprise. It was my father who had come through the door.\u2018Why is he here?\u2019I stared at him, unable to believe that he was actually here. He gently placed his hand on my head.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201dUnlike his emotionless voice, his large hand felt quite warm.\u2018Is this a dream?\u2019I could barely believe what was happening. As I continued to stare at him unconsciously, his hand retracted.\u201cRest.\u201dI stared blankly at his retreating figure, then laughed to myself.\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled, Jubelian.\u2019He had been cold-hearted towards me ever since I was young. He had even detained me in the original novel.\u2018He only checked up on me because he doesn\u2019t want to look like a heartless father who neglects his sick daughter.\u2019I destroyed any lingering attachments I had to avoid developing futile expectations.* * *\u201cYou\u2019ve overexerted yourself recently. Please rest well.\u201dAs Allen advised, I decided to rest by reading a book on my bed.\u2018This is boring.\u2019A novel would\u2019ve been more entertaining, but this book was about human resources and estate management.\u2018This is what I get for neglecting my studies until now.\u2019Some people might wonder why the duke\u2019s only daughter would even bother studying, but the reality wasn\u2019t that simple. My father wouldn\u2019t pass down his title to an incompetent person like me, so it was likely that he would get remarried to produce a successor. In that case, I would also have to get married or become independent with only a small share of my inheritance to support myself. But I had no intention of doing the former.\u2018Getting married would be too risky.\u2019In a conservative setting like this, the activities of married women were limited to fulfilling their responsibilities for their families. They were expected to diligently oversee their family\u2019s reputation while maintaining dignity as hostesses. In addition, they might have to bear restrictions on living lavishly if the husband was their only source of income.\u2018All this goes against my goal of spending money on what I want, whenever I want.\u2019There was only one solution.\u2018If I get some inheritance and become independent, I might be able to make more money.\u2019If I got lucky, I might acquire a big share of the inheritance and even some titles my father was responsible for. But the biggest stumbling block came after that. In my new life, I learned manners and basic literacy skills that were expected of a noble lady. With these meager skills, it would be difficult to survive in this world by myself. I could try to build my own source of income, but I knew better than that.\u2018Starting a business isn\u2019t for everyone.\u2019Although I possessed the knowledge of modern civilization, there weren\u2019t many things I knew how to make. I didn\u2019t have excellent speaking or business skills, nor did I have many connections. There was a high probability that I would fail and end up with debt.\u2018The only solution I can think of right now would be to maximize the money I inherited from my father. The problem is, I don\u2019t know how.\u2019I sighed when I came to this unpleasant conclusion. Then I heard a knock on the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - Staying Home\u201cLetters that have arrived for you, Lady Floyen.\u201dI sat up.\u2018They came as expected.\u2019Although my social reputation was in shambles, it was nothing compared to people\u2019s reverence of my father, a living hero.\u201cPlease bring them here.\u201dMerilyn carried in a silver tray, stacked with a pile of letters.\u201cHere they are.\u201dI skimmed through the letters one by one, unable to resist the urge to laugh each time. Although there were dozens of letters, not a single one was sincere.\u2018It\u2019s as if they\u2019re telling me that I have lived my life in vain.\u2019Although this left a bitter taste in my mouth, I wasn\u2019t upset.\u2018I am the only person to blame.\u2019In the past, I never cared about what other people thought of me because I was too busy trying to win Mikhail\u2019s affection. While I frequently lashed out at people who offended me, I showed him favor no matter how he treated me. As a consequence, I became a loner. There was no one else to blame for this but me.\u201cDo you want me to put these letters away, Lady Floyen?\u201dI suddenly heard Merilyn speak, and I looked up at her. Since I was done skimming through the letters, she probably thought I wanted to put them away.\u201cNo, I will reply to all of them myself.\u201d\u201cAre you sure\u2026 you want to reply to these letters?\u201d she widened her eyes.I chuckled at her question. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. They sent them to me out of concern, so I must personally reply to them.\u201dI knew very well that these people didn\u2019t send me letters because they were worried about me. However, there were several reasons why I couldn\u2019t ignore them like I usually did.\u2018Many nobles are resentful towards me for ignoring them\u2026 I will have to show them that I\u2019m not that kind of person anymore.\u2019No matter how poorly I was perceived before, people would change their opinion about me if I showed them my subtle but clear transformation into a better person. Writing replies to these letters was a part of my plan, but I ran into an obstacle before I even started.\u2018What should I write?\u2019Since I had been extremely uninterested in the lives of other people, I didn\u2019t know their preferences, much less how to strike a correspondence.\u2018I don\u2019t even know anyone well enough to compliment them.\u2019An idea sprung in my head when I glanced at Merilyn.\u2018Now that I think about it, Merilyn must have written replies to these letters all this time.\u2019When one thinks of a maid, they usually think of a person who does the laundry or cleans the house. But unlike ordinary maids, maids-in-waiting were expected to possess good speaking skills and knowledge of social affairs. Because they were tasked with assisting aristocrats, they usually hailed from fallen noble families or middle-class families that could afford an education. In other words, Merilyn was like my secretary.\u201cI have a request, Merilyn.\u201d\u201cPlease do tell.\u201d\u201cCan you help me reply to these letters?\u201dMerilyn widened her eyes and gaped at me with a bewildered expression. This was natural, given I had never asked for her help in the past.\u2018Well, I\u2019m not the stupidly prideful girl that I used to be anymore.\u2019I looked at Merilyn and said, \u201cI just need to know a little bit about the families we usually interact with.\u201d\u201cYes, I will do my best.\u201dI smiled at her compliance and replied, \u201cThank you. It\u2019s reassuring to have your help.\u201dAt my words, Merilyn briefly looked at me strangely before quickly fixing her expression.\u201cThen, I will bring you a pen and some paper.\u201d* * *Merilyn stood outside the door of the duke\u2019s office with a stiff expression. Madam Perez, the head of housekeeping, glanced at her and announced, \u201cThis is the girl who serves Lady Jubelian, Master.\u201dThere was no answer, but the door opened.Merilyn gulped nervously and stepped inside the room. However, the sight before her turned her fear into admiration. The duke was standing in front of a large window, his silver hair dyed with red from the amber sunset. He looked like a picturesque painting.His voice promptly brought Merilyn back to reality.\u201cWhat did Jubelian do today?\u201d\u201cS-she wrote replies to letters after reading a book.\u201dMerilyn\u2019s stuttered answer subtly changed the man\u2019s stony expression.\u201cShe read a book?\u201dHis surprised expression left as quickly as it came. Merilyn glanced at the duke\u2019s blue eyes, which reminded her of the vast sea, and did her best to keep herself together.He then asked her another question.\u201cWhat kind of book?\u201d\u201cIts main topic is about estate management.\u201dAt Merilyn\u2019s answer, the duke slightly frowned.\u201cWhy?\u201dIt was natural for him to ask this because Jubelian never read any books before. Merilyn recalled what Jubelian had said when she asked for the book.\u201cI\u2019ll be a nuisance to my father if I don\u2019t even know the basics.\u201d\u201cShe told me she doesn\u2019t want to be a nuisance to you\u2026\u201d\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why she would read something like that.\u201dHe had an annoyed tone, but Merilyn could feel that it was markedly different from when he talked to her.Merilyn spoke without thinking twice.\u201cPerhaps\u2026 she wants to talk to you.\u201dThe duke stiffened at her words.Merilyn gulped nervously.\u2018Did I just say something stupid?\u2019At that moment, she heard him speak in a low voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Staying Home\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to know something like that to talk to me.\u201dContrary to his indifferent tone, he was smiling. It was such a dazzling sight that Merilyn couldn\u2019t help but blankly stare at his face again.\u201cTake good care of my daughter,\u201d he commanded with a soft voice. His indifferent expression took over his face again as if he didn\u2019t even smile in the first place.* * *Four days had passed since I secluded myself in my room. During that time, I finished reading all the books I borrowed from the library.\u2018I need a new book now\u2026\u2019Merilyn had gone out to do some errands, so Sella was in my room as her replacement. I glanced at her.\u201cIs there something that you need, Lady Floyen?\u201d she asked.Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t ask Sella to bring me books. Unlike Merilyn, who had received an education, Sella could only read basic words.\u2018It would be better if I went to the library myself.\u2019I didn\u2019t want Sella to feel bad if she knew the reason why I didn\u2019t send her to the library, so I decided to send her elsewhere.\u201cCan you bring me some chocolate cookies and tea, Sella?\u201d\u201cYes, of course! I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dWhen she left, I told another maid that I would be getting books from the library and ventured outside my room.\u2018Ah, it\u2019s quite a hassle to find the right book to read every time.\u2019I opened the door to the library while lost in thought and gasped when I saw who else was inside: my father!\u201cOh, f-father! G-good morning!\u201d I stuttered with astonishment.Although I greeted him, I didn\u2019t expect him to answer.\u201cIt\u2019s not morning but the afternoon,\u201d he replied to my surprise.Although he found fault with something I said, as expected, it wouldn\u2019t do me any good to be hurt by his response.\u201cYes, it is indeed. That was my mistake,\u201d I agreed calmly, hoping that was the end of our conversation.I walked towards the bookshelf.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 estate management theory,\u201d he said.My father was burning a hole at the book I was holding. His stony expression gave away his thoughts.\u2018It seems like he\u2019s asking me why I\u2019m reading something like this.\u2019I hurriedly placed the book back on the shelf.\u201cYes, I was simply curious about what kind of duties my father performs as a lord.\u201dHis expression hardened at my excuses.\u201cWhy were you curious about that?\u201d\u2018Oh, what if he thinks I\u2019m getting greedy?\u2019I didn\u2019t want him to misunderstand me, so I replied with a dry tone to avoid sounding materialistic or ambitious.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any other intentions; I was just curious.\u201dAlthough I tried to avoid offending him, he frowned slightly. I gulped nervously and added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for bothering you. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201dI sneakily ended the conversation and tried to leave the library.\u201cJubelian.\u201dA cold voice called my name, so I turned back again. My father was staring at me with a stony face.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u2018Does he have something to say to me?\u2019My head was starting to hurt as I tried to figure out my father\u2019s intentions.\u2018Allen advised me to relax my mind and body\u2026\u2019Although I was afraid of falling ill again, I couldn\u2019t ignore my father\u2019s burdensome gaze.\u2018I guess I can\u2019t avoid it.\u2019I settled myself on the couch across from him. The soft, fluffy cushion relaxed my body, but I was still on the edge about what he had to say.\u201cJubelian.\u201dAlthough I forced myself to listen attentively to him, I doubted the words he asked next.\u201cDo you know the three elements that make up an estate?\u201dI didn\u2019t expect him to quiz me, but I responded promptly without missing a beat.\u201cThe land is the foundation of an estate, the lord establishes and protects order, and the people are responsible for the production of resources.\u201d\u201cYou have learned well.\u201d\u201cYes, since I have read the entire book.\u201dThinking that this was all he had to say, I was about to ask him if I could go back to my room.\u201cThen, do you know this as well?\u201dHowever, my father\u2019s pop quiz wasn\u2019t over. He continued to ask me questions as if to check that I had read the book thoroughly.\u2018When will this end?\u2019When I glanced at the time, I saw that it was already three o\u2019clock, two hours after I had left my room. I usually had teatime around this hour.\u2018Oh, those chocolate cookies I told Sella to bring\u2026\u2019I was thinking about this when I heard a knock on the door.\u201cThe guest has arrived, Master.\u201dMy father stood up at the words of Derrick, our butler.\u2018Is it finally over?\u2019\u00a0I observed him with tentative relief.\u2018Please, please leave me alone.\u2019However, my father continued to defy my expectations and walked in front of the bookshelf. I suppressed the urge to sigh.\u201cMaster,\u201d Derrick called again.My father didn\u2019t answer.\u2018Why is he looking for a book instead of responding to him?\u2019Before curiosity continued to swallow me up, he walked towards me with two books that he had just picked out.\u201cRead these.\u201dHe handed them to me and left the library. I looked after his tall profile with trembling eyes, then checked the titles of the books he gave me. I could barely believe my eyes.\u2018Why do you want an ordinary lady to read about military strategy and tactics, Father?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - A Familiar VisitorIt would\u2019ve been helpful if my father had given me books on agriculture or commerce, but these books contained information that I was never going to use in my life.\u2018Since he told me to read it, I should at least try, right?\u2019I had already planned to read many books that would aid my goal of becoming independent. It was rather troublesome that he added more to my growing list.I sighed as I thought about all the things I had to do when something caught my eye.\u2018A pendant?\u2019It was inlaid with a large blue gemstone that looked familiar.\u2018Where have I seen this before?\u2019I recalled that it was similar to the necklace that my father always wore around his neck.\u2018Oh, it\u2019s his.\u2019He must\u2019ve forgotten about it and left it here. After deciding that I would give it back to him later, I tucked the necklace into my pocket.* * *When I came back to my room, Merilyn had also returned from her errand.\u201cDid it go well?\u201dShe politely nodded. \u201cYes, Lady Floyen. As requested, the letters were delivered to the noble families.\u201d\u201cThank you for going through the trouble.\u201d When I commended Merilyn for her work, a strange expression crossed her face again.\u2018Hm\u2026 does it seem like I\u2019m being too petty?\u2019\u00a0Come to think of it, I used to hate having to do more work than usual.\u2018I\u2019ll give her a bonus later. For now, I\u2019ll just give her some sweets.\u2019\u00a0I handed Merilyn the plate of chocolate cookies.\u201cTake this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t touched it yet,\u201d I said, in case she thought I was giving her leftovers. \u201cThey\u2019re new.\u201dMerilyn continued to look at me with a strange expression, then took the cookies and bowed. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cOf course. You can leave now.\u201dI sipped my tea when she left the room.\u2018The responses to my letters will come soon.\u2019\u00a0Until now, I had never replied to anyone. The noble families who sent them to me certainly wouldn\u2019t be expecting handwritten letters, but when they did, they were obligated to write back. All I had to do now was wait patiently.It was a cumbersome but necessary process for the sake of my future. I could only live peacefully after I subdued their hostility towards me.* * *As always, the royal family was a topic of concern among the nobles.\u201cThe borders are stable now, so why doesn\u2019t His Majesty the Emperor bring His Highness the Prince back to the palace?\u201d\u201cHer Highness the Princess is also coming of age soon. Will they ever grace us with their presence?\u201dThe royal prince and princess had never shown their faces in the social scene, so all the nobles were very curious about them.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say your cousin was serving at the northern border, Lord Luigi?\u201d\u201cI heard from him that His Highness the Prince is always wearing a helmet, so he has never seen his face.\u201d\u201cIs there a reason why he\u2019s always wearing a helmet?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he has a scar on his face or\u2026\u201dEveryone tensed, so the person who had previously led the conversation prevented him from making this bold claim. \u201cThat may be the case, but we don\u2019t know unless we see him in person, right?\u201dSomeone quickly brought up a new topic to gossip about. \u201cBy the way, did you receive the letters from Lady Floyen?\u201dThe next topic of interest after the royal family was the ducal family, and people gladly joined in to speak their thoughts.\u201cYes, it seems like she has finally matured,\u201d a noble answered pridefully. He had been one of the few families who received a reply.However, a grating voice wasn\u2019t afraid to voice criticism. \u201cThere\u2019s no way a person like her could have changed.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right! You can\u2019t just forget about all the things she did in the past! The letters must have been written by someone else.\u201dAmong the many nobles who didn\u2019t receive a reply from Jubelian, those who resented her didn\u2019t hold back on condemning her.\u201cIt\u2019s weird that someone who used to do whatever she wanted would suddenly do something like this.\u201dThose who neither received a reply nor resented her also expressed their doubts. Lady Floyen\u2019s change of behavior was inevitably a concern in the social world due to her powerful position and beauty. Although they gossiped about her, they were subtly envious of the people she had replied to.\u2018This is sickening,\u2019\u00a0a man attending the banquet thought. He felt disappointed by all the things he heard.\u201cWhat do you think about this incident, Sir?\u201d someone asked him.In response to the aristocratic man\u2019s question, the man glared at him with cold eyes. His lips twisted into a frown.\u201cI think you\u2019re very rude to ask something like that.\u201d After speaking his mind, he turned around.\u201cS-sir Mikhail!\u201d The aristocratic man desperately called after him, but he was already gone.After leaving the banquet hall, Mikhail clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.\u00a0\u2018What do I think about this?\u2019A certain woman\u2019s pale face came to mind. In an instant, a cold smile graced his lips.\u2018It\u2019s obvious what she\u2019s thinking. This is just another scheme to get my attention.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - A Familiar VisitorAct 2. Why are you doing this to me?I had been spending most of my time in my room, enjoying the lifestyle of a homebody.\u2018I\u2019m bored,\u2019\u00a0I thought as I eyed the clock. There were still two hours until dinner. I was thinking about what I could do in the meantime when something caught my eye.\u2018The books my father gave me\u2026 should I read them?\u2019I didn\u2019t know when he was going to give me another pop quiz, so I thought this was a good idea. I started with the tactics book. Although I expected it would be boring, I was pleasantly surprised.\u2018Wow, what\u2019s this?\u2019\u00a0Anecdotes and clever war tactics were vividly described in the book. I felt like I was reading a heroic fantasy novel. The book was so entertaining and compelling that I soon forgot I was situated in an uncomfortable posture.\u2018Oh no, my arm is numb.\u2019As I changed my posture, I felt something in my pocket.\u00a0\u2018Ah, my father\u2019s pendant.\u2019I bookmarked the page I was on and took the pendant out of my pocket. The blue gemstone reminded me of the sea. The light that reflected from its surface scattered silver shards in all directions.\u2018Should I just keep this? It looks expensive.\u2019\u00a0Although I was tempted, I was too afraid that my father would find out. It would be better to give it back to him.\u2018Since he spends more time in his office, I\u2019ll go there.\u2019\u00a0I left my room and walked through a long corridor lined with all kinds of decorative paintings and statues.\u2018It\u2019s always so clean here.\u2019\u00a0The white marble floor was pristine because the maids frequently cleaned it.\u2018They\u2019re probably swamped with work every day\u2026\u2019When I saw the gleaming armors lining the wall, I suddenly felt guilty about all the varnish I had bought. With such thoughts, I passed the drawing-room and continued to walk towards my destination. I was just about to turn the corner that led into his office when I heard a voice.\u201cDon\u2019t think of convincing me anymore.\u201dI stopped in my tracks. There was someone else with my father.\u00a0\u2018I feel like I\u2019ve heard this voice somewhere before. Is it one of his servants?\u2019At that moment, I heard another voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning, not a suggestion.\u201dIf I wasn\u2019t wrong, this apathetic voice belonged to my father.\u00a0\u2018But who would be talking to my father for such a long time?\u2019\u00a0Even Derrick, our butler, would come out of my father\u2019s office in less than an hour, which was already considered a long time. However, this person had been here for five hours, since I last saw my father.\u2018It\u2019s unusual for someone to be able to talk with him for this long.\u2019At that moment, the door to the drawing-room next to the office opened with a creak. I quickly hid behind the corner. Fortunately, there was a pillar in front of me that further obscured their view.\u00a0\u2018He won\u2019t be able to see me from there, right?\u2019I glanced at the corridor in front of the drawing-room and saw my father and a young man in a black cloak.\u2018Wow, he\u2019s really tall.\u2019\u00a0The man was even taller than my father, so he definitely exceeded average height. Even so, he didn\u2019t look like a brute.\u2018Hm\u2026 he looks familiar.\u2019\u00a0I was about to realize something, but the man interrupted my thoughts.\u201cIt\u2019s useless to tamper with it.\u201dWhen I leaned further out to take a better look at the man, my breath caught in my throat.\u00a0\u2018Wow.\u2019I had grown up with my father, so I usually wasn\u2019t impressed by handsome men. Even so, I couldn\u2019t help but admire him. This man had black hair and red eyes that were slightly aloof and lidded as if he was drowsy. His masculine yet beautiful face was ethereal; he wasn\u2019t just a handsome man, but comparable to a craftsman\u2019s life masterpiece.\u2018I\u2019ve never seen someone who didn\u2019t look subpar next to my father,\u2019\u00a0\u00a0I thought. Both of them possessed icy demeanors, but there was still a subtle difference. While my father composed himself sharply and intelligently, this man was darker and more dangerous.An overdue question arose in my head.\u00a0\u2018Who is he? It\u2019s my first time seeing him, but I feel like I\u2019ve seen him before.\u2019I slowly observed the man again.\u00a0\u2018A black cloak with a hood and a claymore strapped on his back\u2026\u2019He wasn\u2019t a knight or a soldier because he was carrying a big sword. Using a sword like that near one\u2019s allies could accidentally injure them. It was also unreasonable to label him as a thief or an assassin. Those were jobs that required one to blend in, which would have been impossible to do with a sword like his. With these options crossed out, I guessed that he was a mercenary or a wandering swordsman who had no restrictions as to which weapon he could use.At that moment, my father placed his hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMax,\u201d he said.\u2018Is that his name?\u2019\u00a0My curiosity heightened because my father didn\u2019t have many people he could call by name.\u00a0\u2018Who is this man and why is my father so friendly with him?\u2019I was trying to guess their relationship when my father suddenly glanced around. I quickly hid behind the pillar.\u2018Whew, I almost got caught.\u2019After calming down, I frowned.\u00a0\u2018Wait, why am I hiding?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Father\u2019s DiscipleI was questioning myself when the conversation resumed.\u201cSwordsmanship exists to protect precious things, not to slaughter. You seem to have forgotten this basic principle.\u201d My father\u2019s stern voice was so sharp that it made me flinch.However, the other man was adamant. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget. I simply don\u2019t want to have a weakness.\u201dHis words reminded me of myself. I bitterly smiled.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m a person with many faults\u2026 that\u2019s why nobody needs me.\u2019My father had kept a distance from me for as long as I can remember. My ex-boyfriend, Mikhail, was no different. Although I wasn\u2019t upset about this, I felt sympathetic towards my past self. I sighed.\u201cSometimes, a person gets stronger to protect their weaknesses,\u201d my father said.I wondered what he wanted to protect. Perhaps it was his lofty status and sense of honor, or more graciously, his precious subordinates. After all, he had always placed great importance on his work.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t know what his weaknesses are, but he can defend himself no matter what happens. Unlike me\u2026\u2019At that moment, the young man\u2019s grim voice broke my unhappy thoughts. \u201cMaster.\u201dI widened my eyes.\u00a0\u2018Master? I don\u2019t think my father took any disciples\u2026\u2019Surprised by what the man had just called my father, I peeked past the corner to look at them again.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more of your lectures. I\u2019ll be going.\u201d His tone was so grim and indifferent that even my father paled in comparison.\u2018There\u2019s no need to be better than him at things like that\u2026\u2019\u00a0I continued to watch them with a frown.\u201cSomeday, you will also find someone; a precious existence that you will want to protect,\u201d my father said. Although he spoke sternly, his voice was filled with an affection that I had never witnessed before.I unconsciously bit my lower lip before straightening my expression.\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s nothing to mull over. I\u2019ve already decided to give up on trying to receive his affection.\u2019I still had a long, happy life ahead of me. I didn\u2019t want to be dragged down by this anymore.\u2018Let\u2019s not be shaken.\u2019If I gave up trying to win my father\u2019s affections, nothing he said could hurt me anymore. I firmly promised myself to stay resilient.At that moment, my father\u2019s disciple lowered his voice to a cold whisper. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t found that precious existence yet, but it looks like I\u2019ve found a hiding rat.\u201dI came to my senses upon hearing the very thing that aroused my worst fears.\u00a0\u2018What? A rat?\u2019I shuddered with disgust as goosebumps rose on my skin. My melancholy thoughts had disappeared without a trace.\u2018Where is the rat?\u2019\u00a0I couldn\u2019t bolt from my spot without being noticed, so I scanned my surroundings. The thought that this creature might be near me was terrifying.\u201cShall I catch it?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was like that of a savior\u2019s.I nodded violently.\u00a0\u2018Yes, please catch it!\u2019However, my desperate pleas were rejected by my father. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said.I felt displeased.\u00a0\u2018Why not, Father?\u2019As I silently disagreed with him, my father\u2019s disciple spoke perversely. \u201cWhy? Do you know who I\u2019m talking about?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019\u00a0I didn\u2019t expect my father to say that he was acquainted with a rat, but then it occurred to me that I was in a novel. I managed to calm myself.\u2018In fairy tales, animals and humans can communicate\u2026 My father is a transcendent being, so maybe he can talk to animals. If he saw the rat often, he might have developed some affection for it.\u2019Even so, I couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy.\u00a0\u2018I really hate rats!\u2019In my previous life, I once saw a rat the size of the entire length of my arm. I had been looking around the warehouse of a convenience store that I was working part-time at. Although the rat scampered away after I made a great fuss, I was too scared to enter the warehouse after that and soon quit my job.Now I was faced with the same problem in this life, but what\u2019s worse is that this rat had infiltrated my own home. I didn\u2019t feel safe here anymore; it could\u2019ve found its way around the corridors, rooms, and everywhere else. The rat might have even nibbled the food I ate.\u2018This is frightening!\u2019\u00a0The more I thought about it, the more my courage grew to take action.\u00a0\u2018If I ignore this problem, more rats may overrun my home.\u2019Because my mother was no longer here with us, I was still the only lady of this family, and therefore the high-ranking lady. Although I didn\u2019t have much authority, this position was a good enough reason for people to take me seriously if I asked them to catch the rat.\u2018I\u2019m going to tell Father.\u2019I was about to walk up to him with determination when I heard him say, \u201cIf you touch that child\u2026 even if it\u2019s you, I won\u2019t let it slide.\u201dI had never heard my father speak in such a chilling tone before. It sounded like he was warning me. I immediately changed my mind.\u00a0\u2018Maybe I should just go back to my room. I need to live.\u2019I squeezed my father\u2019s pendant and quietly left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Father\u2019s DiscipleWhen the person listening in to their conversation left, the tense air slightly relaxed.\u2018Those steps. How annoying.\u2019\u00a0The young man wore a frown on his handsome face from this mysterious cause of displeasure.\u201cMax.\u201dHe turned to his master, who had just called his name. \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDid you call her that, knowing who she was?\u201d Although his master\u2019s monotone voice wasn\u2019t too different from usual, the look in his eyes was very fierce. It had been a long time since this man revealed what lay behind his indifferent mask.\u201cI don\u2019t know who she is.\u201dThere was only one person who could bring out this reaction from his master. Although Max knew who she was, he continued to stare at his master indifferently.Ten years had passed since he started learning swordsmanship from his master, at the age of twelve. Max knew how strict and blunt he could be. Even so, there were moments when his master softened his usually stony demeanor\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s my daughter.\u201dThat was only when he talked about his daughter.Max recalled her name. \u201cJubell.\u201dHis master smiled. \u201cYes.\u201dMax had only mentioned his daughter\u2019s nickname, but his expression had already softened. The young man frowned.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s impossible to understand.\u2019When Max\u2019s mother died at a very young age, his life was threatened by enemies within his own family. It was Duke Floyen, his master, who protected him from frightening situations and taught him how to defend himself.\u201cSince you consider me to be your master, I will secretly teach you swordsmanship for your survival.\u201dAt one point, Max looked up to his master so much that he wanted to become just like him. He had no such aspirations now.\u2018He put a leash on himself for someone like her.\u2019\u00a0At this thought, ice seemed to freeze over the young man\u2019s red eyes. The corner of his tightly closed lips raised crookedly.\u2018I will never have a weakness like you.\u2019\u00a0Max knew very well that his master was having a difficult time because of this weakness of his.\u00a0\u2018The tighter the leash, the weaker one becomes.\u2019He laughed cynically before reverting back to his usual, stony expression.His master observed him and asked, \u201cDo you happen to have someone who frequently comes to mind?\u201dAt the unexpected question, Max shook his head, then scrunched his eyebrows upon recalling an unpleasant experience.\u201cHey, what about change?\u201dHis master sighed at his odd expression. \u201cGo back before it gets too late.\u201dThe young man draped the hood of his cloak over his head and stared at him with sunken eyes. \u201cYou take care of yourself.\u201dAfter wishing a cold farewell, Max jumped out of the window. His master watched him, despite knowing that he was too skilled to get hurt.\u2018It\u2019s worse than I thought.\u2019\u00a0Although he had taught Max to cherish life, his disciple was becoming more and more cold-blooded. He didn\u2019t hesitate to kill his enemies if needed, regardless of means or methods.A dark shadow fell on the duke\u2019s ethereal face.\u00a0\u2018I used to be like that as well.\u2019Duke Regis had realized long ago that the weak died first in times of war. Rather than sympathizing with them, he hadn\u2019t bothered to hide his disgust. But now the cold-blooded man changed, and it was because of a girl so fragile that he had to be careful about even touching her hand.\u201cDad!\u201dA gentle smile lit Regis\u2019s face in the dark.\u2018You don\u2019t know anything, Max.\u2019\u00a0For Regis, his lovely daughter was his dull life\u2019s only salvation. He wanted to teach the importance of this to his foolish disciple.\u2018Because of that child, I can exist as a human, not a monster.\u2019\u00a0She was the reason why he could continue to live without going crazy.* * *After returning to my room, I told the maids that I had seen a rat.\u201cA r-rat?\u201d\u201cThe butler recently hired a pest controller, so I thought he had hunted down every last one of them.\u201dMerilyn shook her head. \u201cThere must have been some left because the mansion is so big. Rats breed quickly.\u201dJust thinking about it made my knees weak with fear.\u00a0\u2018This is terrible. Even seeing one of them would be scary\u2026\u2019Merilyn noticed my worried expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she assured me. \u201cI will report it to Madam Perez so they will never appear again.\u201dI relaxed my expression and smiled.\u00a0\u2018Good thing I didn\u2019t tell my father.\u2019If I had spoken to him at that time, he would\u2019ve stopped me from asking the maids to hunt the rats. But since he didn\u2019t know that I had eavesdropped on his conversation, he would assume that I had seen a rat somewhere else in the mansion.\u2018I can finally relax knowing that they will take care of it.\u2019* * *\u201cFor this reason, I have gathered up the servants to catch rats.\u201dRegis sighed upon receiving this report from Madam Perez, the housekeeper.\u00a0\u2018It seems like she misunderstood our conversation.\u2019The duke became anxious as he tried to think of a way to reassure his daughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - An Invitation\u201cI instructed the servants to catch the rats, but none have been caught yet,\u201d Madam Perez carefully spoke again.Regis closed his eyes and purposely enhanced his senses to detect every living being in this mansion. Even his daughter, who was now in her room, was accounted for. When he couldn\u2019t detect any signs of the small beast, Regis opened his eyes and sighed softly.\u00a0\u2018That\u2019s because there aren\u2019t any rats.\u2019The housekeeper grumbled, unaware of the situation at hand. \u201cNot only are the girls afraid, but Lady Floyen is also anxious about the rats,\u201d she said.He flinched.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s anxious?\u2019\u201cGet Derrick,\u201d the duke immediately commanded.A moment later, the butler entered the room. \u201cI heard you called, Master.\u201dThe duke looked at his butler with a serious expression. \u201cDerrick.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI need your guidance.\u201dDerrick widened his eyes upon hearing his request.\u00a0\u2018Master is asking me for guidance\u2026?\u2019This was a first. It was natural for his master to handle matters by himself.\u2018What on earth is going on?\u2019\u00a0Derrick nervously waited for his master to speak.\u201cWhere do rats usually hide?\u201dDerrick wasn\u2019t sure if he heard correctly. He looked at his master with trembling eyes and asked, \u201cRats?\u201dThe duke sighed at Derrick\u2019s nervous tone. \u201cNever mind that. It was a slip of the tongue. How\u2019s the progress of Jubelian\u2019s list of prospective marriage partners?\u201dDerrick was worried that his master had become ill due to the amount of work he had to do, so he was relieved by this question. \u201cAh, yes. I\u2019m still searching and considering all aspects, such as family background, appearance, wealth, and fame. The list will probably be completed by today.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dFortunately, his master looked content. Derrick sighed in relief, then reported something that he had been hesitating to disclose for a while. \u201cAlso\u2026 Sir Mikhail sent another letter.\u201dThe moment he mentioned that name, the duke\u2019s expression changed. \u201cWhat did he write?\u201dAlthough Derrick had nothing to do with this matter, he was frightened by the duke\u2019s tone. \u201cHe is still urging for an answer. He dismissed Lady Floyen\u2019s actions as a ploy to get his attention.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d The duke was expressionless as usual, but his eyes turned icy and his aura, hostile.Derrick merely watched him.\u00a0\u2018Master is really angry. To be fair, I would be angry if I were him as well.\u2019Mikhail had gone too far, even in his eyes. Although Jubelian had treated him like that before, there was no reason for him to insult her personality. A moment later, the duke rose from his seat. Derrick became nervous as he approached him.\u2018Does he want to read the letter himself?\u2019\u00a0Derrick tried to guess his master\u2019s intentions and extended the letter, but the duke ignored him.\u2018Huh? What is he doing?\u2019\u00a0Derrick was about to turn around when he heard a soft voice.\u201cBurn it.\u201dWhen he turned around, his master had already left.* * *\u201cI heard that a rat was caught, Lady Floyen.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, only one was trapped! There weren\u2019t any more\u2026 so I guess that one came into the house by accident!\u201d Sella\u2019s excited voice comforted me.\u2018Good. Now the house is safe.\u2019\u00a0I was smiling with relief when Merilyn delivered a letter on the silver tray.\u201cThis is addressed to you, Lady Floyen.\u201dIt was the first reply I received after sending a batch of letters. Although it was probably a standard reply, I needed to read it to determine the usual reaction I would receive from communicating with other people. I picked up the letter and saw a rose on the seal.\u00a0\u2018It was sent by Count Arlo?\u2019Count Arlo had a close relationship with my father, so I had a relatively good relationship with his daughter. More accurately, I had a relatively good relationship with her at this point of the novel.\u2018Is this a reply to the letter I sent them?\u2019\u00a0I opened the letter with excitement and was surprised to see what was inside.\u00a0\u2018An invitation!\u2019When I opened it, there was a long letter written with a girl\u2019s cute handwriting. The sender was Rose, the youngest daughter of the family. She was known as a friendly and lively lady in the social scene. In the novel, she became close friends with the royal princess and contributed to my downfall.\u2018Shall I see what she wrote?\u2019\u00a0I began reading the letter, a bit concerned that she might have written sarcastic remarks in response.\u2018Hm?\u2019\u00a0In the letter, Rose asked about how I was doing and talked a bit about herself. She also said it would be great if I could come to her upcoming birthday banquet.\u2018I see. She wants to know whether I\u2019ve recovered and can attend the banquet that will be held three weeks later.\u2019\u00a0This was good news since I was a loner in the social world. I had no reason to decline her invitation.\u201cCould you bring me some papers and a pen, Merilyn?\u201dShe quickly brought me the required materials. I frowned slightly when I saw the yellowish paper and black ink in front of me.\u00a0\u2018They look very dull.\u2019She had invited me to her birthday banquet, so I didn\u2019t want to reply with a half-hearted letter. It might be beneficial for me to develop friendly relations with her since she was going to be acquainted with the royal princess in the future. I wanted to avoid my death at all costs.\u2018I wonder what she likes.\u2019\u00a0I suddenly recalled all the times I had seen her. Although it was only at a distance, I remembered that she enjoyed wearing pretty clothes. I could even tell from her beautiful handwriting that she cared a lot about appearances.When I knew what to do, I called the maids. \u201cSella, please bring some flowers from the garden. Julia, please bring some lace and ribbons.\u201dAfter a while, the materials arrived. \u201cHere are the things you requested, Lady Floyen.\u201dIt was time to show off my penpal skills.\u201cL-Lady Floyen\u2026!\u201d The maids were appalled by what I was doing, but I didn\u2019t care.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - An InvitationUpon the news of Lady Floyen\u2019s illness, the family had prepared a gift with a standard letter.Rose squeezed her eyes shut.\u00a0\u2018We won\u2019t even receive a reply back. Why should we bother sending a letter in the name of Count Arlo?\u2019The only daughter of the duke was as beautiful as a doll delicately created by a craftsman. At one point, Rose had even admired her. But when she encountered the lady in person, she found out that she was very rude, cold, and uncaring. Jubelian only had eyes for Mikhail and didn\u2019t bother to greet other people. Since then, Rose thought it would be a waste to personally send her gifts and letters.That was until she received a direct reply from her.Dear Count Arlo,Thank you for your consideration. How have you been? I am recovering well, but it\u2019s frustrating for me to stay inside even on sunny days.I heard from my father about the roses owned by the Arlo family. I suppose they will be in full bloom soon. I still remember how much my father admired their beauty, and it is regrettable that I cannot see them with my own eyes.Speaking of roses, is your daughter Rose doing well? Although we have not conversed much, I feel close to her as we are of the same age.Rose remembered that Lady Floyen didn\u2019t care about anyone else except for Mikhail, but her own name was mentioned in this letter.\u2018She knows my name! And she thought of me after thinking about roses?\u2019Rose was well connected with other people, but she was otherwise an ordinary aristocratic girl. A few girls even made fun of her name, which meant \u2018queen of flowers,\u2019 and said that she wasn\u2019t worthy of it. Now that Lady Floyen, who was always at the center of attention, had mentioned her personally, Rose\u2019s heart pounded with excitement.\u201cFather! This letter is from Lady Floyen!\u201dOne of the count\u2019s vassals would have been responsible for writing a reply, but Rose insisted that she do it herself. Even so, she didn\u2019t know what to write and ended up inviting Lady Floyen to her birthday banquet. She certainly didn\u2019t expect her to accept her invitation, but Lady Floyen proved her wrong in her next reply. She opened the letter with trembling hands.Daughter of Count Arlo, how have you been?I was surprised by your reply and thrilled by your unexpected invitation. It\u2019s my first time communicating with someone by letter, so please understand if it\u2019s lacking. I tried decorating it with my limited skills since I heard that the esteemed daughter of Count Arlo likes flowers. What do you think? My letter is probably nothing compared to yours, but I hope you like it.It\u2019s fun to communicate with someone who is both kind and beautiful, just like the roses that your respected family proudly owns. I look forward to meeting you and will spare my words until then.\u2014 Jubelian Eloy Floyen.Not only was her writing good, but Rose also liked the letter itself. There was a lace frame around the paper, and it was decorated with small ribbons and pressed flowers.\u2018She decorated this for me\u2026?\u2019\u00a0Rose giggled and felt a strange sort of excitement as she looked at the lady\u2019s letter. It was like she had become a special person to her.Rose lay on her bed and read it several more times before grabbing some papers from a drawer.\u00a0\u2018I have to reply quickly!\u2019She was about to dip her quill pen in the ink, then stopped.\u00a0\u2018No, I can\u2019t send it like this.\u2019She called for her maids and made a great fuss. \u201cEmily, pick some flowers for me! Laura, bring me some ribbons\u2014the pretty and colorful ones!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to use it to decorate the letter, right? If madam finds out\u2026\u201dWhen Laura trailed off, Rose became sullen. \u201cCan\u2019t we do something about it?\u201d\u201cI can find some ribbons from torn clothes,\u201d Laura replied with a sigh.Rose\u2019s face brightened and she nodded with excitement. \u201cOkay!\u201d* * *I opened another letter from Rose and sighed.\u00a0\u2018I didn\u2019t know she would send me another one\u2026\u2019In my previous letter, I had subtly told her to not reply until we met at the banquet. It seemed like she didn\u2019t understand this.\u2018I guess this is a good way to practice my writing skills.\u2019This time, her reply was tremendously long, which made the task seem even more daunting.\u00a0\u2018What should I say now?\u2019I smiled after looking at her letter again. The awkwardly decorated flowers and ribbons showed that she had tinkered with it as well. It didn\u2019t look so bad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Rose\u2019s Gift\u2018Is it because she\u2019s only a teenager? The letter is really cute.\u2019A condensed version of it was as follows:Dear Lady Floyen,I am writing to you on a sunny day. You have further brightened up my day by accepting my invitation and decorating your letters. I look forward to seeing your beauty and elegance at my birthday banquet!If you don\u2019t mind, I also hope that you will call me \u2018Rose\u2019 the next time I see you. If that makes you uncomfortable, please don\u2019t feel pressured and forgive me with an open heart.I look forward to seeing you, Lady Floyen.Sincerely,RoseIn the elaborately designed letter, she had also written praises about me and details about how magnificent her banquet was going to be. As a result, it amounted to three pages.\u2018Seeing how she wrote back to me in such detail, it is clear that she is expecting a nice gift.\u2019\u00a0I sighed and folded the letter.\u201cPlease make preparations to go downtown,\u201d I told Marilyn.\u201cDo you have something that you need?\u201d she asked with a puzzled expression. \u201cIf so, I can just call the trader here.\u201d\u201cNo, I want to choose something myself.\u201dMerilyn continued to look at me with a puzzled expression, but I was full of determination.\u00a0\u2018Rose will surely be disappointed if I give her an insincere gift. Even if it\u2019s a hassle, I must choose something myself.\u2019I could tell why she had praised me so much in the letter, even though we weren\u2019t close. Rose was probably hoping that I would give her something special for her birthday banquet. This wasn\u2019t surprising, considering my powerful status, but it was still burdensome to meet such expectations.I began to think about a suitable gift and left the mansion.* * *High society was once again thrilled to hear about what Lady Floyen had been up to.\u201cMy goodness! It\u2019s a surprise that the brazen princess didn\u2019t ignore the invitation!\u201d\u201cShe used to ignore every invitation that wasn\u2019t sent by the imperial family\u2026 It\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d\u201cCount Arlo\u2019s daughter is rather ordinary. What kind of charms does she have to make Lady Floyen behave like that?\u201d\u201cI heard that many women are decorating their letters with pressed flowers and ribbons these days!\u201d\u201cDoes Lady Floyen know that she has started a trend?\u201dA young man who had been quietly listening to their conversation turned around and pursed his lips.\u00a0\u2018Count Arlo, huh.\u2019After leaving the banquet hall, he went straight to his carriage. \u201cLet\u2019s head home,\u201d he told a servant.His carriage arrived at Marquess Hessen\u2019s townhouse.\u201cWelcome back, young master.\u201dInstead of acknowledging the speaker, the man took off his coat and handed it to him. The servant bowed his head and took his coat, then stilled upon hearing his master\u2019s cold voice.\u201cTell the butler\u2026\u201d There was a brief moment of hesitation before he continued. His domineering voice spoke over the other man\u2019s bowed head. \u201c\u2026I will be going to Count Arlo\u2019s banquet.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dThe servant was about to leave the room when the man spoke again, more urgently this time. \u201cOh, and\u2026 are there any letters that came for me?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d the servant replied with a shake of his head. \u201cAre you waiting for something?\u201d\u201cNo, you may leave,\u201d the man said, evading his question with a cold tone.When he left, the man gritted his teeth and narrowed his eyes.\u00a0\u2018How can you do this\u2026 Jubelian!\u2019Although he believed that she had faked her illness, he sent a letter out of consideration to the days when they were engaged. The woman who used to annoy him like a stupid dog still hadn\u2019t answered him, but he couldn\u2019t accept this fact.\u2018Does she want even more attention from me?\u2019He tried to come up with an explanation and understand her intentions, but it only frustrated him even more. He gritted his teeth and hit the wall out of resentment.\u2018What in the world are you doing, Jubelian?\u2019* * *\u2018Living quietly is a difficult thing to ask for\u2026\u2019I counted how many people were following me.\u00a0\u2018Geraldine, Owen, Castro, Todd\u2026\u2019\u00a0The top ten knights of my family had surrounded me like walls.\u2018I\u2019m just going shopping\u2026 they didn\u2019t need to do this.\u2019I had planned to go with just one or two escorts to avoid unnecessary attention, but there was nothing I could do about my current predicament; my father refused to let me go outside unless I was accompanied by all of them.\u2018There\u2019s good security near the capital, so I don\u2019t see why I need this many escorts\u2026\u2019I had stayed quiet and kept out of trouble recently, so I thought I would be able to shop peacefully by myself. This was clearly not the case.\u2018Well, I\u2019m glad that there aren\u2019t many people today. Where is the workshop, anyway?\u2019I surveyed my surroundings. There were three workshops that produced handicrafts for women in this area. Kerin Workshop, the largest and most famous one, was located at the center of downtown. However, I had another place in mind.\u2018If I give her something from Kerin, Rose will end up disliking me.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Rose\u2019s GiftI remembered that later in the novel, Kerin Workshop was exposed for using toxic materials. If I gave her something from there and she fell ill because of it, it would only be a matter of time before rumors spread and I became the Arlo family\u2019s public enemy. There was still a chance for me to develop an unfavorable relationship with Rose, so this was definitely a place to avoid.I continued walking until two other workshops came into sight, smiling wide.\u00a0\u2018There, I see the signboards!\u2019Although Fyodor Workshop boasted a long history, it was on the verge of bankruptcy. On the other hand, multiple craftsmen collaborated at Grada Workshop to systematically produce things.I stepped toward my destination when Geraldine, the leader of the escort knights, asked, \u201cAre you sure you want to enter this place, Lady Floyen?\u201dIt was natural for him to doubt my decision; I was heading towards the shabby Fyodor Workshop, which was located deep inside an alleyway.\u2018It\u2019s definitely this place.\u2019\u00a0Anyone who heard the rumors would avoid Fyodor Workshop because it was on the verge of bankruptcy, but I knew things that they didn\u2019t.\u201cYes,\u201d I replied to Geraldine.When I entered the store, I found a man sitting in the corner of a workshop filled with shabby handicrafts. A normal person would\u2019ve backed away from the scene, perhaps even stumbled, but I approached him resolutely. In addition to his untidy appearance, the man\u2019s long, disheveled hair covered most of his face. Despite being young, he was devoid of vitality.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not in a state where I can make anything right now. I apologize if I have disrespected you or your family in any way, but please visit another workshop.\u201dI was the only customer in this workshop, yet he still refused me. I laughed with reassurance.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s a good thing I decided to come here.\u2019Other people would have left with indignation, but I knew why he was behaving like this.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s because he inherited the family business.\u2019From the day he was born, Ian Fyodor, the master of Fyodor Workshop, had been under immense pressure to become a craftsman like his father, his grandfather, and all those before him. When the expectations became too much to handle, he lost the motivation to make anything and neglected his workshop.\u201cI want to request something from you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d I could hear the distrust in his voice.\u2018Because you will soon become known as the best craftsman in the empire.\u2019Six months later, the princess would wear a necklace with an unusual design on the day of her coming-of-age ceremony. It would become the hot topic of high society and propel Ian Fyodor into fame.\u2018His value is going to skyrocket in the future, so it wouldn\u2019t hurt for me to buy some of his works in advance.\u2019In other words, I wanted to invest in him for the sake of my prosperous future. I glanced at my lottery ticket, Ian.\u201cOnly you can make the thing I want.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to intimidate me now?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cWell, he just\u2026\u201d Ian looked at the knights standing behind me and trailed off.I turned around, but it didn\u2019t look like any of them were threatening him, thinking,\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no way these good-for-nothing escorts would stand up for me.\u2019\u201cIs there a reason why I can\u2019t request something from you?\u201dInstead of answering my question, he spoke coldly. \u201cWhy are you being so stubborn?\u201d\u201cBecause I believe you will make it better than anyone else.\u201dAt my earnest words, Ian parted his lips. \u201cMe\u2026 you believe in me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d I smiled and imagined the prosperous future I was going to have after selling a handicraft that this man made.\u201cCan you tell me what you want then?\u201d Ian asked with a low voice. He sounded unsure, but I had definitely acquired his approval.\u2018Finally! It seems like I\u2019m getting my hands on something from him after all.\u2019\u00a0I happily recalled the object I had in mind.\u00a0\u2018This should be good enough, right?\u2019* * *Derrick handed a document to Duke Floyen. \u201cHere is the list for Lady Floyen\u2019s prospective marriage partners, Master.\u201dThe duke furrowed his eyebrows after reading it.\u00a0\u2018Why is his name here\u2026\u2019He circled the name with gritted teeth and called for the butler. \u201cDerrick, please remove this name\u2026\u201dAt that moment, the door to the office opened. Roy Hamilton, the duke\u2019s lieutenant, strode in. He was a prudent person, so he only reported to the duke when there was a major issue.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dAt the duke\u2019s question, Roy swallowed nervously. \u201cA messenger from the emperor is here to see you. It seems like he wants you to visit the imperial palace.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Mikhail\u2019s RegretsAfter I picked out Rose\u2019s gift, I thought about what else I needed to buy. The escort knights continued to follow me, but I did my best to ignore them.\u2018Cosmetics, colored ink, and paper\u2026 Oh! This looks nice as well! I\u2019m glad I can shop comfortably now that Father isn\u2019t here.\u2019\u00a0I sighed when I thought about Father\u2019s pendant, which was still tucked away in my drawer.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018When should I return it to him, anyway? I hope I don\u2019t get scolded for keeping it for so long without telling him.\u2019As I mulled over my predicament, something caught my eye.\u00a0\u2018Wow, this is very neat and pretty.\u2019\u00a0I studied the set of blue gemstone cufflinks with silver rims. It would be a suitable accessory for my father.\u2018Maybe he won\u2019t be so mad if I return his pendant with this.\u2019\u00a0With these beautiful cufflinks as a bribe, I would be able to keep him happy.I pointed at them without hesitation. \u201cI\u2019ll be buying this.\u201dThe clerk placed the cufflinks in a wooden box and handed it to me.\u2018This should be enough, right?\u2019At that moment, someone greeted me. \u201cOh, who is this? If it isn\u2019t Lady Floyen!\u201dWhen I saw the person who greeted me, my expression hardened.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s Radian, a man who possesses the tongue of a viper.\u2019\u00a0He usually led social gatherings and was infamous for starting rumors. I avoided him even before I recalled the memories of my past life, which goes to show how notorious he was. Even worse, he was Mikhail\u2019s cousin.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing you after your aunt\u2019s birthday banquet.\u201d\u2018Isn\u2019t it common sense to not acknowledge your cousin\u2019s ex-girlfriend?\u201dAlthough I was displeased, I smiled and greeted him. \u201cYes, it has been a long time, Esteemed Son of Droil.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018Esteemed Son of Droil?\u2019 I\u2019m disappointed that you are calling me so formally. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve met.\u201d He kissed the back of my hand and laughed eerily. \u201cPlease call me Radian, my lady. You\u2019re as beautiful as a daffodil.\u201dAsking someone to call them by their first name and kissing the back of a lady\u2019s hand without permission was improper, even if the two had met in the past. I wanted to point this out but refrained from doing so. The last thing I needed was for him to start rumors about me.\u2018Things will also become complicated if he talks to Mikhail about me.\u2019\u201cI wish I could talk to you more, but there\u2019s somewhere I need to be. Please excuse me.\u201d I hurriedly removed my hand from his and spoke sternly.Radian laughed. \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry, my lady? It\u2019s as if you are running away from something\u2026\u201dI cut him off. \u201cI have a strict schedule,\u201d I said firmly.Although my words probably made him feel unpleasant, Radian laughed and said lightheartedly, \u201cAh, I see. Well, it was nice to meet you. I\u2014\u201d\u201cYes, it was nice meeting you as well. Goodbye.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to waste any more time, so I cut him off again and turned around. The escort knights formed a barricade around me.\u201cThis way, Lady Floyen,\u201d Geraldine said politely.\u2018I guess they do their job at times like this.\u2019\u00a0I feigned a smile.In the end, it didn\u2019t matter if Radian started rumors about me because his reputation was just as bad as mine. Even so, he had ruined my mood, so I decided to continue shopping at another time. It was fortunate that I was able to get away from him quickly, otherwise, he would have too much to say to Mikhail about me.\u2018I hope we never meet again\u2026\u2019\u00a0I shuddered at the unpleasant sensation that lingered on the back of my hand and rubbed it against the hem of my skirt.* * *An unexpected visitor arrived at Marquess Hessen\u2019s townhouse before dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Mikhail.\u201dIt was Radian Svel Droil. Mikhail\u2019s expression twisted when he saw his cousin, who he didn\u2019t get along with.\u201cMy legs are sore. Can I sit down?\u201d\u201cGet ou\u2014\u201d Mikhail tried to order him to leave immediately, but Radian was one step ahead of him.\u201cOh, you want me to sit down? Thanks,\u201d he said.Mikhail frowned at Radian, who cut him off and promptly sat down on one of the parlor chairs in the drawing-room.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Mikhail asked wearily.Radian laughed and spoke in a relaxed tone. \u201cNow there, I came with good news. Shouldn\u2019t you bring me some tea?\u201d\u201cSpit it out and leave,\u201d Mikhail said coldly.Radian wasn\u2019t intimidated by his cousin\u2019s tone. He shrugged and said, \u201cI guess this attitude of yours is why Lady Floyen left you for a new lover.\u201dWhen Radian mentioned the words \u2018new lover,\u2019 Mikhail\u2019s face twisted. \u201cNonsense. What are you talking about?\u201dWithout a hint of concern, Radian pulled out a pipe cigarette from the inside pocket of his coat. \u201cNonsense? Aren\u2019t you being too harsh to me? I haven\u2019t even said what I saw today.\u201d He grinned as he lit the pipe cigarette. \u201cShe was buying a set of cufflinks. I saw it with my own eyes.\u201d\u2018Cufflinks?\u2019\u00a0Mikhail widened his eyes. Cufflinks were usually given to family members or lovers. It was a way for women to demurely reveal their love and possessiveness to the receiver.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Mikhail\u2019s Regrets\u2018No, it can\u2019t be.\u2019\u00a0Mikhail narrowed his eyes.\u201cIsn\u2019t this good news for you? You were worried sick, wondering if she had faked that goodbye!\u201d Radian smirked. Smoked puffed out of his mouth as he laughed.Mikhail felt extremely displeased by the unpleasant scent of tobacco and his cousin\u2019s vulgar appearance. \u201cGet out if you\u2019re done talking. I have nothing to say to you.\u201d\u201cI apologize if I have offended you in any way. But I wonder if the displeasure you feel right now is really because of me,\u201d Radian said with a smile. Then he stood up and left the room.Mikhail frowned and clenched his fists.\u00a0\u2018This is ridiculous.\u2019\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help thinking about Jubelian, who had obsessed over him these past few years. He thought it was strange of her to suddenly say goodbye without any regrets, but now it made sense. Upon learning the truth, Mikhail felt justifiably angry.\u2018She has a new man?\u2019\u00a0He furrowed his eyebrows and gritted his teeth. Back then, he had desperately wished for her to become interested in someone new so she could stop bothering him. But now that it had actually happened, he was filled with anger.\u2018Why does a woman like that make me so angry\u2026\u2019\u00a0As confusion ravaged his thoughts, a memory of Jubelian\u2019s beautiful face when she confessed to him came to mind.\u201cI like you, Mikhail.\u201dAt that moment, he became filled with so much anger that he punched the wall.\u201cYoung master! Are you okay?\u201d His servants ran toward him in surprise, but he stood still without responding to them.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything until now. I wish you happiness.\u201dAs he thought about the woman who had left without a hint of regret, a tingling sensation arose in his chest. Mikhail ignored the pain and clenched his fists.\u00a0\u2018She acted as if she was only going to love me for the rest of her life, but she\u2019s already seeing another man?\u2019His eyes gleamed.\u00a0\u2018You will pay the price for deceiving me, Jubelian.\u2019* * *I wanted to give the pendant and cufflinks to my father as soon as I came home, but he was absent.\u2018Will he be home late again?\u2019\u00a0I wondered to myself.\u201cMaster said he won\u2019t be home for the next few days because of special training sessions,\u201d Merilyn said as if she had read my mind.It wasn\u2019t uncommon for my father to leave the mansion for multiple days at a time, so I calmly went up to my room and placed the pendant and cufflinks in my drawer.\u2018I\u2019ll give them to him when he comes back.\u2019After I took a bath and changed into comfortable clothes, I opened the military tactics book that my father gave me. It was so entertaining that I quickly immersed myself in the contents.* * *The emperor\u2019s secret mission for Duke Floyen was a simple but laborious task.\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep well after that rat snuck into the imperial family.\u201d The emperor ambiguously mentioned that he was almost assassinated. \u201cI want you, the man I trust the most, to take care of them.\u201dThe purpose of the mission was to eliminate the mastermind behind the assassins. Since the only assassin that was captured committed suicide without leaving any evidence behind, there was no other option but to ambush another assassin for interrogation.Although it was appropriate for the emperor to give this order to a close and trusted friend, it wasn\u2019t suitable for a duke and hero of this empire to carry out. Nevertheless, the duke accepted the mission.As soon as he left the emperor\u2019s office, the imperial guards spoke with resentment. \u201cAre you really going to follow this command? If it\u2019s an ambush, we\u2026!\u201dThey rambled about wanting to ambush the assassin in the duke\u2019s stead.\u201cYou men do not need to become a chess piece like me,\u201d the duke said sternly. Although he was being considerate of his subordinates, the knights groaned at their superior\u2019s words.Max, who had been eavesdropping on the conversation, silently scoffed.\u00a0\u2018He can get rid of him if he wants to, but he\u2019s still following the orders of that trash we call emperor\u2026 I\u2019m disappointed in you, Duke Floyen.\u2019In Max\u2019s eyes, the current emperor, Carlos, was a greedy and pathetic man who was no match for his master. But it was obvious why this outstanding man, who he had once aspired to be, continued to follow the emperor\u2019s orders.\u2018It must be because of his weakness.\u2019\u00a0As Max cynically recalled this, a knight approached the duke.\u201cI am here to report that I have successfully completed my escort mission.\u201d\u201cWhat did Jubelian do today?\u201d the duke asked with an indifferent expression.\u201cShe went shopping today and looked very happy.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d the duke smiled warmly.\u2018Why is he like this?\u2019\u00a0Max furrowed his eyebrows. He used to think that his master was similar to him, but during times like these, he couldn\u2019t understand him at all.\u2018When she gets married, she won\u2019t be part of his family anymore. So why is he so devoted to her?\u2019\u00a0For the sake of the family name, it was common to abandon useless children. But whenever his master thought about his daughter, who was nothing more than a nuisance, he revealed a soft spot in his otherwise impenetrable exterior. When the emperor first noticed this weakness, he used it to exploit the duke.\u201cSometimes, a person gets stronger to protect their weaknesses.\u201d\u2018What a load of crap.\u2019\u00a0Max scoffed, recalling what his master had said a few days ago. His eyes then gleamed with determination.\u00a0\u2018Maybe I should check it out myself.\u2019He decided to pay a visit to the person who weakened his master.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Ambush\u2018It\u2019s quiet.\u2019Max was close to becoming a transcendent being, so the mansion was easy to break into, especially in the absence of the duke. No one noticed him climb over the wall, walk through the garden, and approach the main building.Max surveyed the exterior and noticed a large window with a balcony.\u00a0\u2018There it is.\u2019\u00a0He quietly climbed to the third floor using the building\u2019s jagged exterior.\u2018Is it locked?\u2019\u00a0Max approached the transparent glass door on the balcony. When he pushed it open, the lace curtains fluttered. He smirked.\u00a0\u2018This mansion is very defenseless. Master won\u2019t have an excuse even if she\u2019s murdered or robbed.\u2019When he entered the dark room, he could make out a woman\u2019s silhouette on the bed. Max approached the woman silently.\u2018She looks weak,\u2019\u00a0Max thought she would resemble his master, who was tall and strong. But the woman was slender and frail as if she could break at any moment.\u00a0\u2018She won\u2019t be able to learn swordsmanship with a body like that. That means Master doesn\u2019t plan on making her his successor\u2026 So why on earth is he so obsessed with someone like her?\u2019Although Max didn\u2019t understand his master\u2019s intentions, he suddenly had an idea. The corner of his lips lifted.\u00a0\u2018I wonder what he will do if she disappears.\u2019He silently observed Jubelian with a bloodthirsty gaze. Even in the dark, he could see the woman\u2019s slender neck; it looked like it could easily snap at his will.At that moment, a voice broke the silence. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I think you\u2019ve come to the wrong house.\u201dMax reeled back with surprise when he heard the woman\u2019s casual tone.\u00a0\u2018She was awake this whole time?\u2019A person\u2019s usual reaction would be to beg for mercy or scream in fear, but she was behaving rather strangely. \u201cThis is Duke Floyen\u2019s mansion,\u201d she said lazily.\u2018What is wrong with this woman?\u2019\u00a0Max furrowed his eyebrows as an unfamiliar feeling washed over him for the first time. Countless people venerated and bowed to him in admiration. A few even dared to patronize him. But he never met anyone like this laid-back and carefree woman.Duke Floyen would certainly be helpful at a time like this, but he wasn\u2019t in the mansion tonight. Max guessed that the woman was bluffing to hide her fear.\u201cI\u2019ve come to the right house,\u201d Max said bluntly. The corner of his lips raised as he imagined Jubelian getting down to the ground and begging for her life, but her reaction continued to stupify him.\u201cReally? How about changing your mind now? I think you will regret coming to this house.\u201d The woman was now sitting up on her bed. The moonlight that filtered through the window outlined her ethereal face. Although she looked tired, her expression harmonized with her peculiar, laid-back aura. It was no wonder she was rumored to be the subject of envy of every young woman.Even so, Max wasn\u2019t amused. No matter how much he thought about it, there was nothing useful about her, except for her outstanding appearance.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s nothing special,\u2019\u00a0he thought.When the woman\u2019s mouth widened with laughter, he found himself staring at her. Her red lips parted. \u201cI still have a year left before I die,\u201d she said with an extremely dry tone that didn\u2019t match her humorous appearance.It seemed like she was talking to herself, but Max could clearly hear her confident voice.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Is she not understanding the situation?\u2019\u00a0He was annoyed by her casual behavior as she fearlessly stretched her body in front of him. He frowned at this unpleasant sensation, then reminded himself that she was probably bluffing. When he remembered those who had dared to act arrogantly in front of him, his handsome face filled with bloodlust.\u2018This act will collapse the moment her life is threatened.\u2019\u00a0Max made up his mind to frighten the foolish woman, but she casually lit a candlestick on the bedside table.\u2018How dare you,\u2019\u00a0Max thought. He tried to extinguish the candle and knock the woman down but paused at the sight of her face, which was now brightly lit by the candle. She possessed the delicate appearance of a doll, but it was her terribly unconventional gaze that captured his full attention.\u2018You are\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max stepped forward without realizing it. At that moment, the woman\u2019s doll-like face came to life.\u201cOh, you are my father\u2019s disciple,\u201d she said with a smile.Although Max had made up his mind to scare her, he forgot about this as soon as he saw her smiling face.\u201cOh, um\u2026 I was looking for the thing you\u2019re buying right now.\u201dThe woman who had managed to annoy him during that brief meeting was now in front of him.* * *I woke up feeling very thirsty. It seemed like I had a cold because of my sore throat.\u2018I\u2019ll take some medicine in the morning,\u2019\u00a0I thought as I opened my eyes to drink some water.\u2018Wait, what is that?\u2019\u00a0When I became conscious of the black shadow looking down on me, I wondered if I was having a nightmare. A gust of chilly air coming through the open window of the balcony proved otherwise. There were only two explanations for a situation like this: this man was either a thief or\u2026\u00a0\u2018Is he an assassin?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - AmbushWith this in mind, I pondered upon who might have sent him here, but there were too many people to choose from. After all, I was the villainess of this novel.\u2018Why did you behave like that, past me?\u2019\u00a0I was berating myself when I realized something. In novels, there was an unspoken rule that made it impossible for the protagonists, supporting characters, and villains to die at the beginning of the story. In other words, my life as the main villainess wasn\u2019t in danger until the princess\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony.\u2018There are many chapters in the novel where I appear\u2026 Maybe this is something that\u2019s supposed to happen to me. I shouldn\u2019t be scared.\u2019\u00a0I calmed my anxious thoughts and stared at the suspicious shadow looming over me.\u2018I feel like I\u2019ve seen him somewhere. Who is he?\u2019\u00a0Since he broke in and entered my house at night, he was probably an assassin or a thief. Although I was still uncertain by this, I knew for sure that he wasn\u2019t sane. If he were a normal person, he wouldn\u2019t have aimed for the mansion of Duke Floyen, the best swordsman in the empire.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I think you\u2019ve come to the wrong house. This is Duke Floyen\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come to the right place,\u201d the man replied. He must be insane or really bold.\u201cReally? How about changing your mind now? I think you will regret coming to this house.\u201d I tried to persuade him out of pity, but the man stayed silent.\u201cI still have a year left before I die,\u201d I mumbled to myself. Of course, I had no intention of dying that soon because I still had the time to improve my reputation.\u2018I won\u2019t miss a single opportunity to do so.\u2019I decided to light the candle on my bedside table to inform the knights standing guard at my door that someone had broken into my room. I kept my eye on the man while picking up a match and wondered what he was thinking. When the candle caught on fire, my surroundings became bright. Only then could I see the man\u2019s black hair, pale skin, and overly elegant appearance. It was impossible to forget a face like his.\u201cOh, you are my father\u2019s disciple.\u201d I realized that he had come to the right place, after all.\u2018Thank God.\u2019\u00a0I felt relieved that the intruder was neither a thief nor an assassin. Although I tried to convince myself that I wasn\u2019t going to die at this point in the novel, I had actually been very scared. Additionally, I had learned a very important lesson.\u00a0\u2018I have to make sure to lock the windows and doors from now on.\u2019I sat down on my bed as the adrenaline left my system and made my legs go weak. My father\u2019s disciple, who had been staring at me blankly for a while, suddenly looked at the candle fiercely.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.\u2018I\u2019m the daughter of Duke Floyen. How dare he treat me like this?\u2019\u00a0If I were any other noble, he would probably be sentenced to death. Although I was letting him treat me this way, I thought it would be better to teach him a lesson for his future.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are you talking to me like that?\u201d\u201cBecause it makes sense to.\u201d He looked at me coldly. In addition to being extremely arrogant, his manner of speech resembled my father.\u2018But Father doesn\u2019t even go that far. It\u2019s been said that \u201cthe pupil surpasses the master,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t have to surpass him in speaking like that.\u2019Out of relief and fatigue, I found myself unable to stop smiling. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name again?\u201d I asked.Instead of answering my question, the man glared at me. I became somewhat embarrassed and tried to explain why I was asking for his name. \u201cOh, it\u2019s not that I forgot your name on purpose\u2026\u201dAt that moment, I heard a knock on the door.\u201cIs something the matter, Lady Floyen?\u201d Although I was reassured by the knight speaking outside the door, the tip of a sword suddenly pressed against my neck.I stared at the culprit, my father\u2019s disciple.\u00a0\u2018Is he frightened\u2026 No, he looks too merciless for that.\u2019\u00a0There was no sign of surprise in his red eyes, only fierceness. I stared at him and tried to understand why he was threatening me.\u2018He wants me to act.\u2019\u00a0I was already living my second life as a villainess, so this was a rather simple request.\u201cOh, I had a nightmare, so I decided to light the candle for a little bit.\u201d It was a good enough excuse, but Geraldine, the leader of the knights and my cousin, asked again with a sincere voice.\u201cReally? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep, so I\u2019m reading a book.\u201d I felt as though I was going to pass out again, but I was afraid that my father\u2019s disciple was going to act rashly if I told the truth.\u201cSleeping late is bad for your health. Go back to bed as soon as you can,\u201d Geraldine said.It was fitting that he gave me such advice at a time like this. \u201cYes, thank you for the advice.\u201dI couldn\u2019t hear anything by the door after that. It seemed like the knights had gone back to their posts.\u00a0\u2018Did they really leave?\u2019\u00a0Although I wasn\u2019t sure, the more pressing problem was my father\u2019s disciple, who was still staring at me with his sword pressed against my neck.\u201cI did what you wanted, so can you move your sword now?\u201d I asked quietly.His expression twisted when I finished speaking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - Deep Slumber\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he asked with a stern voice. When he looked at me angrily, I frowned.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re upset when you\u2019re in the wrong.\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, he spoke with an icy voice. \u201cSpeak to me politely.\u201dI didn\u2019t understand why he wanted me to do this. It didn\u2019t help that I was getting more and more sleepy, but I managed to keep my eyes open.\u201cIf you want me to talk to you politely, you should have\u2026\u201d I tried to snap back at him but ended up yawning before I could finish my sentence. My embarrassment roused my senses, making me forget my sleepiness for a moment.\u2018Oh, I just showed an unseemly sight,\u2019\u00a0I thought.The man suddenly removed his sword from my neck and continued staring at me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.I probably looked ugly when I yawned, but he was looking at me as if he had seen something very strange. In order to avoid upsetting him again, I decided to speak very politely, as if I were a preschool teacher soothing a whining child.\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep because of you, so I\u2019m tired. Don\u2019t you have to go back home as well?\u201dThe man continued to stare at me silently, so I wondered if he was going to ignore my question again. Then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a home.\u201dI looked at him with surprise. His physical appearance was so refined that he could\u2019ve passed off as a prince.\u00a0\u2018Well, I guess that\u2019s a bit of a stretch.\u2019Due to the appearance-based nature of aristocratic society, it was unheard of to go outside without wearing luxurious clothes. The man in front of me was only wearing a simple white shirt and black pants. Although he carried a long sword instead of a claymore today, it was unpolished. He seemed more like a wandering swordsman or mercenary than a knight or prince.\u2018He was also wearing a hooded cloak before.\u2019\u00a0Considering his current and previous attire, he was\u2026\u201cAre you a wanderer?\u201dHe nodded with an unpleasant expression.\u2018I was right. He must be a wandering swordsman or mercenary who usually frequents inns. Judging by his simple clothes and lack of belongings\u2026 he was probably kicked out because he couldn\u2019t pay. I guess he came here because he has nowhere else to go, but why today of all days\u2026\u2019Now that I thought about it, he didn\u2019t receive an official welcome when he visited my father a few days ago. The servants didn\u2019t attend to him either, so he probably wasn\u2019t an official guest.\u00a0\u2018That\u2019s probably why he didn\u2019t come through the front door but through my window instead.\u2019I sighed and felt displeased by my father\u2019s absence at a time like this.\u00a0\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019\u00a0Although I wasn\u2019t a nice person by nature, I wasn\u2019t so coldhearted as to ignore someone who didn\u2019t have a home to go back to. After renting so many one-bedroom apartments in my past life, I knew how sad it was to not have a permanent home. I looked at him pitifully.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a place to go tonight, you can stay in my room for a while.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d He stared at me with widened eyes. His expression made me feel a little proud for some reason.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. Just pay me back when you become successful in the future.\u201dHe continued to stare at me with confusion. I guess this was expected because not many people would show this degree of kindness.\u201cI\u2019m going to go back to sleep,\u201d I said, content that the situation was sorted out. \u201cYou should go to sleep too. Okay?\u201dI lied back down, but suddenly felt a gust of cold air through the open window. \u201cHey, could you close the window?\u201d I asked him.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d he responded arrogantly to my request and looked down at me with folded arms.\u2018What did my father even teach him? Obviously not manners.\u2019When I sat up on my bed again, I noticed his thin clothes.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s troublesome\u2026 but it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019\u00a0I closed the window and brought a blanket over to him. He was still standing with an arrogant posture.\u201cIt gets cold at night because we\u2019re in-between seasons,\u201d I reminded him.He stared at me without accepting the blanket.\u00a0\u2018Seriously? He can\u2019t even do this on his own\u2026\u2019\u00a0I felt like I was caring for a pet. Although I wanted to say something, I didn\u2019t even have the energy to argue with him anymore. I stood on my tippy toes and placed the blanket over his shoulders. His red eyes stared at me as if to ask what I was doing, but I didn\u2019t have the energy to explain myself.\u201cGood night.\u201d I immediately fell asleep after saying those words.* * *\u2018She really fell asleep.\u2019\u00a0Max furrowed his eyebrows and gazed at the woman in front of him. \u2018What kind of person is she?\u2019He had met many people in his life, but no one had treated him like this. They either trembled in fear or tried to hide their fear behind words of flattery. Their fear was the only thing they shared in common. However, his master\u2019s daughter wasn\u2019t like either of those things. He recalled the first time they met.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Deep Slumber\u201cHey, can you hear me?\u201dShe was relaxed the whole time they talked and had even fallen asleep in front of him. Not even his strong master had shown such a defenseless state towards him. Max had no choice but to marvel at her.\u2018This is annoying.\u2019\u00a0He was bothered by her laid-back attitude and impolite manner of speech. Upon remembering his top priority, which was to deal with the source of his annoyance, Max reached towards the woman\u2019s neck with narrowed eyes. But without realizing it, his hand stopped where her lips were. The tip of his finger lightly brushed against them, but the woman continued to sleep soundly.\u2018She is so dull.\u2019\u00a0Max frowned and brushed away a few strands of hair that clung to the woman\u2019s face.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s so troublesome that even I\u2019m beginning to feel tired\u2026\u2019When he became aware of this odd sensation, Max hardened his expression.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m feeling tired?\u2019\u00a0After witnessing numerous deaths on the battlefield, he had never let his guard down. But Max felt himself becoming drowsy and his eyelids growing heavy; this unfamiliar sensation was definitely fatigue. He blinked and tried to keep alert, but exhaustion swallowed him whole.\u2018I can\u2019t fall asleep here\u2026\u2019\u00a0His determination to observe the woman lost strength. The young man who had resisted falling asleep eventually admitted defeat.\u00a0\u2018\u2026I\u2019ll just rest for a little bit.\u2019Max blew out the candle and curled up near the foot of the woman\u2019s bed. The warm blanket that covered his body made him feel even more drowsy. When he closed his eyes, he felt a comfortable sensation that he hadn\u2019t felt since his mother passed away.* * *A vicious dragon was ravaging the empire. It was like a natural disaster had swallowed the empire whole, inflicting harm even when barriers had been set up and people were being evacuated.I quietly hid at home when the dragon began attacking our mansion. When it spotted me, the creature approached with flaring nostrils. Before it was too late, my father appeared to fight it.\u201cHow dare you aim for my daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go!\u201dAlthough it was clearly a dream, I felt happy when I woke up.\u00a0\u2018Dragons, huh.\u2019\u00a0It seemed like a lucky dream. For some reason, I felt like today would be a good today. That was\u2026 until I saw the man sleeping near the foot of my bed.\u2018Why did he have to fall asleep here out of all the places? Does he like my bed?\u2019\u00a0I sighed and observed the man\u2019s face. Now that his red, warlike eyes were closed, he looked docile.\u00a0\u2018Although he has bad manners, he\u2019s definitely handsome.\u2019I suddenly became worried about what would happen if someone saw him in my room. Perhaps they would think that the vicious Lady Floyen had kidnapped and imprisoned a handsome man. While it was true he was more attractive than Mikhail, I wasn\u2019t very fond of this situation.\u00a0\u2018He should leave before someone misunderstands the situation\u2026\u2019The maids didn\u2019t come into my room without permission, but I didn\u2019t want to risk it. I locked the latch on my door and shook his shoulder, trying to wake him up.\u201cHey\u2026 huh?\u201d The man pushed me so hard that I flopped on the floor. I was lucky there was a carpet, otherwise, my back could have become injured.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The man who had just said what I wanted to say loomed over me. His eyes shined brightly.* * *Max hadn\u2019t felt such warmth and comfort in a long time. He wanted to sleep like this forever, but when he realized that someone was approaching him, goosebumps prickled his skin. After surviving many battles, his body had become extremely sensitive to changes in his environment.Even before he had fully awakened, Max pushed the person who briefly touched him. He climbed over the body and instinctively tried to grab the person\u2019s neck. That\u2019s when he saw a pair of blue eyes. There was only one woman who had eyes akin to periwinkle flowers floating on a serene lake.\u2018Oh, I remember what happened now.\u2019\u00a0When his senses gradually returned, so did his reason. Then he realized what he had done.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ve become insane.\u2019He had originally planned to leave after resting for a while, but he somehow lost control of himself and fell into a deep slumber. He couldn\u2019t find any traces of the drowsiness that had dominated his body, but the aftermath impacted him greatly.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I let my guard down in front of this woman.\u2019\u00a0He reprimanded himself, then saw Jubelian staring at him.\u2018She\u2019s not even agitated.\u2019\u00a0His actions could\u2019ve been fatal, but she didn\u2019t even look frightened.\u201cWhat were you trying to do?\u201d he spat out, attempting to scare her.Contrary to his expectations, the woman broke out into a smile. The corner of her eyes creased and her red lips widened to reveal pearly teeth. When her cheeks brightened to complement her beautiful face, he was reminded of a flower in full bloom. Max tried to look away, but an irresistible force kept him from doing so. He forgot how to think for a moment and stared blankly at her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Living Together in SecretAct 3. Why did I do that?I stared at my father\u2019s disciple.\u00a0\u2018Why is he so ungrateful?\u2019\u00a0I had given him a place to sleep and woke him up on time, but he was still speaking to me in a rude and impolite manner. He reminded me of someone in my previous life who had never opened up to me, even though I had treated him very nicely.\u2018Seriously, why is he so perverse\u2026 He gives off a familiar feeling\u2026\u2019\u00a0I reminisced about the similar being from my past life for a while, then recalled what had been bothering me.\u00a0\u2018That\u2019s not important right now. I have to ask him why he is talking impolitely to me again.\u2019\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d he asked aggressively.I suddenly forgot what I was going to say and burst out laughing.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d The man was displeased, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. The way he behaved was very similar to the little guy I knew from my past life.He glared at me. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d he said fiercely.I felt bad about laughing at him for what seemed like no reason, but it was difficult to control myself after seeing his expression.\u00a0\u2018As I thought, he resembles the aggressive black kitty I often saw near my home.\u2019The man frowned, seeming to be unhappy with my smiling face. \u201cStop laughing,\u201d he commanded.It was difficult to control myself, especially since we weren\u2019t in a dire situation anymore. Then I heard Merilyn\u2019s voice outside the door. \u201cHave you awakened, Lady Floyen?\u201dI immediately stopped laughing and frowned.\u00a0\u2018I should stay calm,\u2019\u00a0I thought to myself. First, I had to do something about the man on top of me.\u201cHey, can you move?\u201d I asked. He frowned at my request but stood up.\u201cYou have to help me up too,\u201d I said. I extended my hands out to him, but he glared at me and turned around, leaving me no choice but to get up myself. I frowned and dusted off my clothes.\u2018Seriously, what\u2019s the matter with him?\u2019\u00a0It seemed like this stubborn man wasn\u2019t going to listen to my plan.\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019\u00a0I recklessly grabbed his hand.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Surely enough, he didn\u2019t budge when I tried to tug him away. I had no choice but to trick him.\u201cCome here. I have something to show you,\u201d I lied.He frowned but didn\u2019t put up a fight when I dragged him into my dressing room, which was connected to my bedroom.\u00a0\u2018It should be safe in here.\u2019\u201cIf you don\u2019t want there to be any misunderstandings, stay here and be quiet,\u201d I said as I opened my closet door.\u201cMisunderstandings?\u201d\u201cYou know, something like how we spent the night together. Well, we did differently.\u201d\u201cA different way?\u201d he asked with curiosity.I was surprised that I had to explain this to him, but I tried to do so in a refined way. \u201cLike how animals mate.\u201d\u201cWhat? What kind of\u2026!\u201d he yelled as soon as I finished speaking.I quickly covered his frowning mouth with my hands.\u00a0\u2018How can he raise his voice here when Merilyn might hear! I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s so careless.\u2019\u00a0When it seemed like he had calmed down, I removed my hands.\u201cYou don\u2019t want someone to think that, right? Great. Me neither.\u201dHis handsome face twisted at my earnest words.\u00a0\u2018Okay, he\u2019s listening to me now.\u2019I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m just asking you to cooperate since you\u2019ve been staying in my room.\u201dThe man stared at me, then nodded slowly. I felt somewhat dispirited now that the rebellious man had suddenly become obedient.\u201cHow nice it is now that you\u2019re listening to me,\u201d I muttered unconsciously.I saw him frowning again. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d He tried to say something, but I hurriedly closed the closet door before he could finish.\u201cIs everything okay, Lady Floyen? Why is the door locked?\u201d When I heard Merilyn\u2019s voice, I quickly walked towards my bedroom door and unlocked it.\u2018I could\u2019ve gotten into big trouble if I hadn\u2019t done so.\u2019\u00a0I sighed in relief and opened the door. Merilyn stared at me with puzzled eyes.\u201cDid something happen? You\u2019ve never locked your door before\u2026\u201d she asked with a worried expression.\u201cOh, um\u2026\u201d I scrambled to make up an excuse. \u201cI was afraid that someone might break in.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Merilyn asked with surprise, then smiled. \u201cMy lady, there\u2019s no such person in the world who would try to break into Duke Floyen\u2019s house! If there is, they must be out of their mind. It\u2019s well-known that neither assassins nor thieves dare to come near the mansion.\u201dI sighed. There had surely been no assassin or thief, but there was definitely an insane man sitting in my closet right now.\u00a0\u2018Merilyn was always careless about such possibilities.\u2019I couldn\u2019t tell her about the intruder hiding in my closet, so I hurriedly added, \u201cWe can never be too sure, especially since Father isn\u2019t here.\u201dMerilyn\u2019s expression hardened at my words as if she suddenly realized the danger we could be in. She clutched my hands with her own. \u201cLady Floyen,\u201d she said with a somber expression. \u201cMaster will safely return home.\u201d\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I answered. Although I was confused as to why she was suddenly saying this, I agreed with her. After all, how would others return home safely if the strongest swordsman in the empire could not?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Living Together in SecretMerilyn continued to look at me with a worried expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful day, my lady. How about taking a walk?\u201d she asked.I once again didn\u2019t understand why she would suggest this. If this were any other day, I would have joyfully agreed, but I couldn\u2019t because of the man hiding in my closet.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t have a choice but to lie to her,\u2019\u00a0I decided.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not feeling well today.\u201d I looked down. This wasn\u2019t completely a lie, as I felt a little sick from the cold air last night. My body was also sore from my father\u2019s disciple pinning me down to the ground this morning.\u201cReally? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Merilyn asked.\u201cOh, I\u2019m just feeling a bit under the weather today,\u201d I reassured her. I deliberately vaguely explained my symptoms, just so I could have an excuse not to go outside, but Merilyn wasn\u2019t letting it slide.\u201cShall I bring Dr. Allen?\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I said.She shook her head with a serious expression and said, \u201cEven the small things should not be overlooked. You are the only heir to the Floyen family.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really not a big deal though.\u201dMerilyn looked dissatisfied. \u201cYou must remember that you\u2019re the only one who can lead the family during master\u2019s absence, my lady.\u201dI inhaled sharply at her burdensome words.\u00a0\u2018But I have no intention of leading the family\u2026\u2019Merilyn sighed. \u201cAs I thought, I can\u2019t just let this slide. I will call Dr. Allen,\u201d she decided.A thought suddenly occurred to me. Even if my image was ruined even further, I had no choice but to use this excuse. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a big deal. It\u2019s actually because\u2026 I fell down from my bed.\u201dMerilyn widened her eyes. \u201cFrom your bed?\u201d She was probably surprised because this never happened to me before.\u201cYes, it doesn\u2019t hurt that much because I fell on the carpet\u2026 but my back aches a little.\u201d I thought this was a pretty good excuse, considering that I had indeed fallen on the carpet, although it was because my father\u2019s disciple had pinned me to the ground.\u201cOh, then I will just bring some medicine for muscle pain,\u201d Merilyn said.I nodded, then wondered what time it was.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m hungry.\u2019\u00a0The clock indicated that it was just before 11am, which was too late for breakfast but too early for lunch. If there wasn\u2019t someone inside my closet, I would\u2019ve gone downstairs and wolfed down a filling brunch.\u201cMerilyn, could you bring some sandwiches as well? More than usual please.\u201d\u201cOf course, my lady. Is there anything else that you need?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep much because I was reading late into the night. I\u2019m feeling a little cranky, so please don\u2019t enter my room without permission,\u201d I added. It was actually my father\u2019s disciple who was feeling cranky, but this request probably wasn\u2019t strange, considering Jubelian\u2019s past personality.\u201cI will do as directed.\u201dAs soon as Merilyn left, I hurriedly went to my closet. When I had pushed the man inside, it didn\u2019t occur to me that some of my dresses were made of fabrics that wrinkle easily.\u2018I hope he didn\u2019t move around too much,\u2019\u00a0I thought as I opened the door. I observed my clothes first and thankfully saw that they were fine. Then I saw my father\u2019s disciple crouching in an uncomfortable posture.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m rather proud of him,\u2019\u00a0I thought.\u201cCan I go out now?\u201d he asked bluntly.\u201cNo, I asked my maid for something, so you will have to wait a little while longer.\u201dThe man\u2019s expression twisted with dissatisfaction. \u201cHow annoying,\u201d he spat. He was handsome even when he frowned.\u2018Well, that doesn\u2019t mean I have feelings for him.\u2019\u00a0Although I occasionally admired his appearance, it didn\u2019t hold any deeper meaning than that. It was akin to how an art enthusiast would admire a work of art.\u2018More than anything else, I refuse to get involved with people who only look good on the outside,\u2019\u00a0I reminded myself.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d It seemed like his natural way of speaking meant being disrespectful and impolite. Because I was a noble lady, this was enough to press charges, but I had given up on teaching him manners since last night.\u2018I\u2019m not even angry at him anymore, not when he acts like a wild animal. Plus, it\u2019s a waste of time to pick a fight when he will only be staying here for a little while.\u2019\u00a0I shouldn\u2019t have to exhaust my emotions on immature people. With this in mind, I asked him something that I had been curious about.\u201cHow long do you plan on staying here?\u201d Although I was doing him a favor, I couldn\u2019t keep him here forever. I would make a decision on how to proceed based on what he planned to do. But instead of answering me, the man wore a surprised expression.\u2018I hope he doesn\u2019t plan to stay until my father returns, although I don\u2019t know when that will be either\u2026\u2019\u00a0My thoughts were becoming more complicated until he finally answered me.\u201cI intend to leave\u2026 today.\u201d His voice held a little hesitation. His expression wasn\u2019t so good either, which made me feel sorry.\u2018Did it sound like I was trying to kick him out?\u2019Out of concern, I asked, \u201cDo you have a place to go?\u201dHe coldly stared at me and said, \u201cDoes it look like I don\u2019t have a place to go?\u201d It was natural for people to get upset over a sensitive topic. Well, there was no reason for him to come here in the first place if he had a place to go, and he wouldn\u2019t have worn such simple clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be honest with me,\u201d I said with a sigh.He frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - In Denial\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201d The man once again responded perversely, even though I had tried my best to speak considerately.\u2018What\u2019s causing him to act so rudely like that?\u2019 I was absorbed in my frustrations for a while, but I soon speculated the cause of his unhappiness. \u2018If he were kicked out yesterday, he probably skipped dinner and didn\u2019t have anything to eat since then.\u2019I could suddenly empathize with him a little better. \u2018It\u2019s true that people are more easily irritated when they\u2019re hungry and don\u2019t have a place to go.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help but pity him.\u201cLet\u2019s have brunch together later,\u201d I said softly.The man stared at me with a stony expression. \u201cWhat?\u201dAt that moment, someone knocked on the door.\u201cOur chef is pretty skilled, so you can expect delicious food,\u201d I said as I closed the closet doors again.* * *\u2018Eat together?\u2019 As he quietly sat in the closet, Max replayed the woman\u2019s words in his head with a strange expression. \u2018Wait, why am I even listening to her?\u2019He was suddenly plagued by doubts and became engulfed in anger upon coming to his senses. \u2018I should just break the doors open and leave.\u2019At that moment, he sensed that someone was approaching. Judging by the rhythm of the person\u2019s feet, it was the maid who had previously visited. Frankly, Max was irritated; he felt the urge to break the closet doors and ruin the woman\u2019s plans to keep him out of sight. But upon remembering her expression when she had offered to eat together, he was pacified.\u2018I\u2019ll wait for a little longer.\u2019 It was the first time that Max had decided to patiently wait for someone else.\u201cI brought some medicine and sandwiches, Lady Floyen.\u201d\u201cThank you, Merilyn. Just a second.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d\u201cCould you come over here and apply the medicine to my back and neck?\u201dMax had expected to get out of this stuffy closet soon, but the woman was taking her sweet time. As his patience quickly ran out, he gritted his teeth in anger. \u2018She said it would only take a second. What in the world is she doing now?\u2019Max clenched his fists, ready to break open the closet doors when he remembered what the woman had said once again. \u201cLet\u2019s have brunch together later.\u201d Strangely enough, he wasn\u2019t able to succumb to his impulses when her laughing face came to mind.\u2018Why am I\u2026\u2019 Now that he thought about it, many things were strange. He hadn\u2019t thought about leaving until the woman asked and he felt his heart tingle when she had offered to eat together. Now, he found himself unable to defy her wishes. Max furrowed his eyebrows and wondered why he was acting like this. His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a scream that came from the very woman who had been bothering him this entire time.\u201cAh!\u201dAlthough he couldn\u2019t see her, he became alert. \u2018Is there an ambush? What happened?\u2019 All sorts of scenarios crossed his mind. Only two people should have been in the room, but there was a possibility that an adept assassin was hiding somewhere.\u2018The woman even went asleep without locking her windows\u2026\u2019 From Max\u2019s point of view, Jubelian was defenseless. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if she was attacked right now.\u2018I have to see what\u2019s happening.\u2019 He reached out to push open the closet doors, then stopped. \u2018Why do I even care?\u2019He frowned at himself for a moment but backtracked when he heard another groan from outside. \u2018\u2026I am only helping her because I can use her in the future. That\u2019s all.\u2019 Max rationalized his incomprehensible behavior and reached out again. He stiffened when he heard the woman\u2019s voice for the third time.\u201cIt\u2019s a little further down there, Merilyn.\u201d\u201cRight here, Lady Floyen?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter listening to their conversation, Max finally figured out the situation and scrunched his face. \u2018What on earth am I doing? I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m being swayed by a woman like that\u2026\u2019 He felt an overwhelming sense of shame, then heard the maid\u2019s voice through the thin doors.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to get some pain medicine from Dr. Allen, my lady.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It will get better now that you put on some medicine.\u201dMax frowned. \u2018She\u2019s good at putting on an act, even though she didn\u2019t even get hurt anywhere.\u2019His expression hardened when Merilyn spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural for your back to feel sore. There are some bruises under your shoulder blades.\u201d\u2018Bruises? What kind of\u2026\u2019 As he pondered over this, he heard the woman speak casually.\u201cOh, I thought it would be okay because I fell on the carpet\u2026 I didn\u2019t know I would get bruises.\u201dIt was then that Max remembered shoving her to the ground this morning. \u2018D*mn it.\u2019 It was only natural for the weak to be the first to perish, so he usually didn\u2019t care if other people were hurt. But the moment he learned that the woman was injured because of him, he felt a little sick to the stomach.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - In Denial\u201cAnyway, I feel better than before. Thank you,\u201d the woman said.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\u201cCould you bring dinner to my room later as well?\u201d\u201cYes, my lady. Please rest.\u201dWhen the maid left the room, Max continued to stay in the closet and eagerly stared at the door. A few minutes later, he sensed the woman\u2019s light and careful gait getting closer.\u2018She\u2019s here.\u2019 The closet door opened, and she came into view.\u201cYou can come out now,\u201d the entrancing woman said. Her surroundings were bright; it looked like she was enveloped in a halo.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Max opened his mouth unconsciously, then closed it. He tried asking the woman if she was okay but found himself unable to do so.She laughed brightly like a flower. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat now as promised.\u201dIf Max was being rational, he would\u2019ve refused her offer. He usually wasn\u2019t hungry and didn\u2019t accept food from strangers. Even so, he was strangely hungry now.\u201cCome this way,\u201d she said. Max felt his heart tingle when Jubelian made hand gestures to usher him forward.\u2018This is only because I\u2019m hungry.\u2019 He again rationalized his confusing behavior. Max followed Jubelian to the small table in her room, where he could see some sandwiches arranged in a way that would be easy to eat. He frowned when he took a closer look.\u2018Is this what I think it is?\u2019 Max wanted to get angry because the sandwich contained an ingredient he hated, but he found himself unable to do so when he saw Jubelian\u2019s face.\u201cHere you go,\u201d she offered. Max didn\u2019t refuse when she handed over a sandwich.\u201cTry it,\u201d she said. \u201cOur chef is very skilled.\u201d At her request, he took a bite and tasted the very thing that made him harden his expression.\u2018It\u2019s indeed what I thought it was.\u2019 The sandwich was full of cucumbers. It was truly terrible.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Jubelian asked.Truthfully, Max didn\u2019t even know what it tasted like because he had swallowed the sandwich whole. Even so, he continued forcing more into his mouth.\u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019 Max mulled over his behavior when the woman spoke with a smile.\u201cDo you not like it?\u201dHe hated it. But instead of answering truthfully, Max slowly shook his head and met the woman\u2019s smiling face. Strangely, his heart tingled again.\u201cI was worried because I have strange preferences for food, but I\u2019m glad you like it as well,\u201d she said as she bit into a sandwich.Max looked at Jubelian, then at the cucumber sandwich he wouldn\u2019t usually spare a glance at. \u2018Is it that good?\u2019 He took another bite of the sandwich and savored it this time. The blandness of cucumber combined with its peculiar smell reignited his dislike for the vegetable. But as he continued eating, he slowly got used to the taste. Maybe it wasn\u2019t as bad as he thought it was.* * *I became sleepy after eating brunch with my father\u2019s disciple, but I didn\u2019t want to take a nap when he was in my room. \u2018It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll pass out from sleepiness.\u2019I decided to read a book to stay focused, but my eyes kept fluttering shut. \u2018What should I do? I\u2019m so tired.\u2019 My vision gradually blurred, but I managed to stay awake for a little longer.\u201cHey,\u201d my father\u2019s disciple suddenly said.I flinched at his voice and unconsciously yawned.\u2018I really have to control myself now.\u2019 Out of embarrassment, I covered my mouth with both hands and barely controlled another yawn. Even so, I couldn\u2019t stop tears from forming in my eyes.\u2018At least I didn\u2019t show my mouth this time.\u2019 I squeezed my eyes shut at this thought. The tears I had held back ran down my face. \u2018Ugh, why do I always do that when I yawn?\u2019 I tried to wipe the tears with my sleeves but stopped when I saw my father\u2019s disciple looming over me.\u2018Huh? When did he get so close?\u2019 I was staring back at him when something soft touched my eyes.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201dI widened my eyes when I saw that his sleeves had become wet with my tears. His shirt was surprisingly soft to the touch, perhaps even softer than my handkerchief, which was made out of the finest cotton in the empire. \u2018This is the highest grade fabric I\u2019ve ever felt. Wasn\u2019t he kicked out because he didn\u2019t have any money?\u2019I became filled with doubt, wondering if I had guessed incorrectly about his identity when a thought occurred to me. \u2018Well, you don\u2019t have to be wealthy to wear high-quality clothes.\u2019 Some people bought expensive clothes to feel better about themselves, even if they didn\u2019t have a lot of money. My father\u2019s disciple was probably like that.At that moment, he frowned and repeated himself. \u201cI asked why you were crying.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 It\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\u201cTell me now.\u201dIt was honestly a little embarrassing. I didn\u2019t want to tell him that yawning made me cry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - A Messenger from the Crocus Family\u201cJust because,\u201d I replied abruptly before quickly changing the topic. \u201cBy the way, you\u2019re really fast. I was startled when you suddenly appeared in front of me.\u201dAlthough I wanted to change the subject, I was truly surprised. He had appeared in front of my eyes in a flash.He laughed. \u201cSurprised by that? How pitiful.\u201d It seemed like arrogance was this man\u2019s default personality, seeing as he was mocking me.\u201cYou must be a really good swordsman like the Imperial Palace knights,\u201d I said with a hint of sarcasm.\u201cI am much stronger than them,\u201d he replied with a frown. His personality clearly showed that he was my father\u2019s disciple, but even though my father could be cold and inconsiderate, he wasn\u2019t this arrogant.\u00a0\u2018Why is he like this?\u2019\u00a0I silently lamented the man\u2019s personality when I saw him staring at me again.\u201cSo why did you cry?\u201dHis persistence was a little annoying, so I felt the urge to tell him the truth and get it over with. But before I could, I heard a knock on the door. \u201cIt\u2019s Derrick, Lady Floyen.\u201dI sighed when I heard his voice. If it were a maid, I would have dismissed her, but I couldn\u2019t do that to Derrick.\u00a0\u2018He wouldn\u2019t have come to see me for nothing,\u2019\u00a0I thought as I stood up. In this mansion, male servants only attended to my father while female servants only attended to me. Since Derrick personally came to my room, something must\u2019ve happened.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can you go in there again?\u201d I asked as I pointed at my closet.Although he wore an unpleasant expression, he obediently complied with my request.\u00a0\u2018At least he listens to me now.\u2019\u00a0When the man successfully hid inside my closet, I approached my bedroom door and opened it. \u201cHello, Derrick. Did you need something?\u201d\u201cA messenger just arrived from Marquis Crocus\u2019s family. He wants to convey a message from Ronald, the eldest son of Marquis Crocus, to you, Lady Floyen.\u201dThe Crocus family was prestigious, so it was probably regarding an important matter. This situation called for me to go downstairs to meet the messenger himself, but I didn\u2019t want to leave my father\u2019s disciple alone in my room.\u00a0\u2018What if one of my maids comes in and sees him while I\u2019m downstairs? I can\u2019t let that happen.\u2019I deliberately coughed and replied, \u201cUnfortunately, I am not feeling well, so it will be difficult for me to go downstairs. Can you receive the message for me instead?\u201dDerrick looked at me with a worried gaze and said, \u201cOf course, my lady. Please rest.\u201dWhen he left, I glanced at my closet and sighed in relief.\u00a0\u2018Hopefully this man doesn\u2019t ask about my tears anymore.\u2019* * *Max tried not to think about it, but the image of the woman\u2019s big eyes filling up with tears plagued his mind.\u00a0\u2018Why did she cry?\u2019Unbeknownst to Jubelian, he was still worrying about this in her closet.\u2018What was so sad that she even had to cover her mouth with both hands\u2026?\u2019\u00a0He suddenly remembered something that he had heard from his close entourage a while ago.\u201cI heard that Lady Floyen really liked Sir Mikhail. People say that she chased him around without caring about her reputation\u2026 In some ways, it\u2019s fortunate that they separated.\u201d\u2018Is it because she can\u2019t forget about him?\u2019\u00a0Max clenched his fists.* * *Not long after I sent him downstairs, I heard Derrick\u2019s voice again. \u201cThis is Derrick again, Lady Floyen.\u201dWhen I opened the door, I saw him smiling. \u201cShould I be expecting good news?\u201d I asked.He straightened his expression and said, \u201cMy lady, the esteemed son of Marquis Crocus sent a message about wanting to be your partner for Count Arlo\u2019s banquet.\u201dI widened my eyes.\u00a0\u2018No way, why is such an esteemed person\u2026\u2019\u00a0Marquis Crocus\u2019s son was considered to be the most suitable successor of the foreign ministry. It felt surreal that such a person was asking to be my partner.\u201cWhat is your response, my lady?\u201dI pondered over this, but it was difficult to come up with a decision on the spot. At that moment, a strange sound came from my dressing room.\u2018No, it can\u2019t be.\u2019\u00a0I trembled slightly and felt the blood rush away from my face. Derrick looked at me with a serious expression. \u201cDid you just hear something from the dressing room, my lady?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I responded calmly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dDerrick gave me a wary look. \u201cI clearly heard something\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s a rat?\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d I replied smoothly. \u201cI\u2019m still not feeling well, so could I rest for now? As for the reply\u2026 let the messenger know that I will send one by letter soon.\u201d\u201cOf course, Lady Floyen. Please rest well.\u201d Derrick slightly bowed his head and left without another word, as if he didn\u2019t want to irritate me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - A Messenger from the Crocus FamilyI sighed in relief.\u00a0\u2018I really thought my heart was going to jump out of my chest this time.\u2019\u00a0I went back to my closet and opened its doors to find my father\u2019s disciple sitting with a blank expression. \u201cExcuse me. Did you just make that noise?\u201d I asked.He stared at me and asked, \u201cAre you going to accept his invitation?\u201d\u2018\u2026Why is he curious about that?\u2019\u00a0Not only was it a strange thing to ask, but it wasn\u2019t something I could answer right away.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d I said. The esteemed son of Marquis Crocus was clearly qualified to become my partner. His appearance was outstanding and comparable to that of Mikhail\u2019s. He was also very popular due to his excellent social skills.\u2018The problem is\u2026 I don\u2019t know why such a person would want to be my partner.\u2019\u00a0I sighed and saw my father\u2019s disciple scrunch his face. \u201cYou should think about it carefully. Appearances aren\u2019t everything,\u201d he advised.I gave him a dumbfounded look. This man had a difficult personality and meager social skills; his only asset was his remarkable appearance.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t believe he just said that\u2026\u2019\u00a0I was still staring at him in shock when he turned towards me and asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Did you make that noise when Derrick was here?\u201d I frowned.He parted his lips then replied stiffly, \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cDo you know that we almost got caught?\u201d\u201cBut we didn\u2019t. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201dI shook my head at his shameless attitude. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. If you were caught, it would\u2019ve caused a commotion and alerted the messenger downstairs. I could\u2019ve been caught up in a scandal with you.\u201dIn aristocratic society, a scandal with someone of a different status meant immediate ostracization. I personally didn\u2019t care about what other people thought of me, but I was still living in my father\u2019s house. He would hate me even more if I did something wrong. In the worst-case scenario that I was kicked out, I would have to face numerous dangers by myself. \u201cI\u2019m taking a big risk by letting you stay here. I would appreciate it if you were more considerate.\u201dHe turned around to look at me again. His red eyes seemed to pierce through me, but I managed to meet his gaze without backing down. He finally avoided my eyes after we stared at each other for a while. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said quietly.I was relieved to see that he at least had some conscience. \u201cYou can come out now,\u201d I said as I reached out to him.He took my hand and stood up. Then he stared at me with a determined gaze. \u201cIf such a thing were to happen\u2026 I\u2019ll take responsibility,\u201d he said.\u2018Ha, why is he taking it so seriously?\u2019\u00a0I couldn\u2019t find it in myself to do the same and found his sincerity so funny that I ended up laughing. \u201cAlright, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said as he pulled my hand slightly.I looked into his bright red eyes. Oddly enough, it seemed that he was hoping that something would happen.\u2018I need to hand this guy over to my father as soon as possible\u2026 When will he be home?\u2019\u00a0I rarely wondered when my father would return home, but I couldn\u2019t help it after spending so much time with the man in front of me.* * *Rumors about Duke Floyen working as an escort for the emperor had begun spreading in secret. It was only a matter of time before it reached the prime minister\u2019s ears.\u2018This will rouse the people\u2019s resentment, resulting in the same thing that happened back then\u2026\u2019\u00a0he thought.During the war with the Tezeria Kingdom 20 years ago, the young emperor had abandoned the imperial palace and fled from the capital. His people whom he deserted became distressed by their leader\u2019s cowardice and pessimism.In his absence, a young knight took the lead in defending the capital. He was Regis Floyen, a member of the Imperial Knights who was next in line to become a duke. Although many people told him to give up and run away, Regis annihilated the enemies who invaded the capital.As the successor of a prestigious family that produced great knights every generation, he became known as a war hero who led the empire to a great victory. But where there is light, there is darkness. The emperor, who had deserted the capital, became known as a coward and traitor.Many people criticized him and urged for his disposal, but Regis had turned the tables by expressing his support for the emperor. In present times, it was not an exaggeration to say that his rapport was barely maintained by his eldest son, the crown prince, who fought for the empire at the borders.\u2018I need to see His Majesty.\u2019\u00a0After realizing the crisis the empire was in, the prime minister entered the palace and asked for an audience with the emperor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - A Gift for My Father\u201cDo you plan on keeping him in the palace for much longer, Your Majesty?\u201d the prime minister asked.The emperor raised an eyebrow. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? There is no one more skilled than him for the job.\u201d His fierce voice revealed an underlying resentment toward Duke Floyen.The prime minister sighed. \u201cOf course, Your Majesty. The duke\u2019s presence will scare these scoundrels in advance and put their efforts to waste, but\u2026\u201d\u00a0\u2018You are belittling his reputation as a national hero,\u2019\u00a0he thought to himself, then he spoke again. \u201cIf you continue to keep him in the palace, the people\u2019s resentment will only increase. I believe it is more important to devise a plan to identify the mastermind behind the assassinations, rather than order the duke to stay.\u201dThe emperor glared at the prime minister, displeased by his unwelcome advice. \u201cI will make the right decision. You don\u2019t have to be so concerned,\u201d he said stubbornly.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d The prime minister tried to make his point again, but the emperor cut him off.\u201cYou can leave, Duke Elios.\u201dThe prime minister sighed. \u201cDuke Floyen had a great reputation in the past, but his current prestige is even greater. If you want to keep him in check, you must bring His Highness the Crown Prince back to the capital. Please use good judgment.\u201d With these parting words, he bowed and left.\u2018How dare he advise me without knowing anything\u2026\u2019\u00a0The emperor\u2019s face twisted as he stared at the ring on his middle finger. It was the eye of Kirke, a symbol of imperial sovereignty created by an archmage who became the very first emperor. A smile slowly appeared on his face.\u2018As long as I have this, he cannot disobey me.\u2019* * *Somewhere near the Central Palace, Regis was sitting on a tree branch with his eyes closed. He didn\u2019t budge even when a weary little bird perched on his shoulder. It jumped up and down a few times before settling comfortably on his shoulder and falling asleep. The atmosphere was so peaceful that it seemed like Regis was taking a break rather than guarding the palace.\u2018There\u2019s someone close by.\u2019\u00a0He opened his eyes as the wind rustled his hair and observed the person approaching the Central Palace. When he saw who it was, he relaxed and let out a yawn.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s just Roy. Well, I should get down now.\u2019\u201cGo,\u201d Regis ordered the bird on his shoulder. When it woke up, the bird chirped and clung to him in resistance. \u201cMy daughter dislikes small animals,\u201d he said firmly. It gazed at Regis with rueful eyes before spreading its wings and flying away.When the duke jumped down the tree, Roy reeled back with amazement. \u201cS-so you were here.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cOh, I just received some news from the mansion\u2014\u201d\u201cGo on.\u201dRoy sighed when his boss impatiently cut him off before he even finished speaking. \u201cYes. It\u2019s about Lady Floyen\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat? Did something happen to Jubelian?\u201d Although his boss was far from talkative, he cut Roy off again.\u201cNo, it seems like she is\u2026 anxious because of Your Grace\u2019s absence\u2026\u201dRegis\u2019s blue eyes glinted when he heard the news.\u00a0\u2018Jubell is looking for me?\u2019\u00a0\u00a0The corner of his lips raised slightly.\u2018Is His Grace smiling\u2026?\u2019\u00a0Roy was surprised for a moment, but he continued reporting the news from the mansion. \u201cLady Floyen is also feeling unwell. It seems like she\u2019s very anxious because she hasn\u2019t left her room since you left the mansion.\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, the duke\u2019s smile disappeared from his face.\u201cI see. It\u2019s time for us to drop this act after all.\u201d He gazed at the window that led to the emperor\u2019s office.* * *I glanced at the three-seat couch that had become the bed of my father\u2019s disciple.\u2018He has really made himself at home,\u2019\u00a0I noted. Four days had already passed since I let him stay. Thankfully, my large room boasted a connected bathroom, so it wasn\u2019t an inconvenient accommodation. I just had to be careful when the maids occasionally came to clean my room or see if I was doing okay. Even so, secretly cohabiting wasn\u2019t smooth sailing.\u2018He probably doesn\u2019t know that the couch he is lying comfortably on was originally my resting place,\u2019\u00a0I complained to myself. His presence not only greatly diminished my personal space, but also made it difficult to differentiate our boundaries.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the man questioned with an expectant gaze. He must\u2019ve noticed that I had been quietly sighing to myself, so he was probing for the cause of my dissatisfaction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - A Gift for My Father\u201cOh, just\u2026 you look comfortable. That\u2019s all,\u201d I mumbled.He furrowed his eyebrows, grunted, \u201cNot really,\u201d and then closed his eyes.I became disheartened by his words.\u00a0\u2018I gave up my resting spot for him, but this is the response I get back?\u2019\u00a0I turned my head towards the window, where I could see the sunset.\u00a0\u2018I wonder why he has to meet my father\u2026\u2019I was lost in thought when my father\u2019s disciple suddenly asked, \u201cWhy do you keep staring at me?\u201d\u201cOh, I was just thinking\u2026 it seems like you have a good relationship with my father.\u201dThere was a moment of silence before he finally said, \u201cIt\u2019s not on the bad side.\u201d\u2018Of course it isn\u2019t.\u2019\u00a0I chuckled emptily. In front of his disciple, my father\u2019s facial expressions and manner of speech were so strange that he seemed like a different person.\u2018Now that I think about it, I have to give back his pendant with the cufflinks I bought\u2026 but I really don\u2019t want to do it in person.\u2019\u00a0I was afraid that he might not like the gift because I was unfamiliar with his preferences. I didn\u2019t want him to throw them away, or else I would surely be offended.\u2018Wait a minute, this man might know more about my father\u2019s tastes.\u2019\u201cHey,\u201d I called out. When his red eyes turned to me, I reconsidered my actions.\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no way someone with a terrible personality like him would answer me honestly.\u2019As I contemplated whether I should ask him or not, he said, \u201cSay what you have to say. I hate it when people stall.\u201d His tone was blunt, but it seemed like he was willing to help me.\u201cWhat do you think about giving a set of cufflinks as a gift?\u201d I finally asked.He frowned. \u201cA gift?\u201d His eyes became hostile, making me flinch.\u2018Why is he looking at me like that? Does he not like the idea of cufflinks?\u2019* * *Cufflinks were usually gifted to a woman\u2019s lover. Max immediately thought of Mikhail when Jubelian asked him about cufflinks. \u201cWho are you giving it to?\u201d he asked.\u201cWho else would I give it to? You should know who,\u201d Jubelian replied quietly.Max felt his mood worsen.\u00a0\u2018Is this stupid woman thinking about clinging to him again?\u2019\u00a0He had learned to never show his true emotions, lest it could be used against him, but his expression unknowingly became fierce.\u201cYou\u2019re going to give cufflinks to someone like that?\u201d As soon as he asked this, the woman\u2019s eyes turned cold.\u201cHey, that\u2019s a little too harsh,\u201d she replied sharply. It was unlike her.Max rarely gave advice because he simply wasn\u2019t interested in other people, but it was frustrating to see the woman defending Mikhail without thinking for herself. He felt a rush of anger and his stomach roiled.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m trying my best to be considerate of you, so why are you taking his side?\u2019\u00a0His knuckles turned white from clenching his fists.\u201cHow can you cling to someone who is so indifferent to you\u2026 Do you have no pride?\u201d he asked coldly.\u00a0\u2018Try refuting that,\u2019\u00a0he thought snarkily. Max had never regretted insulting someone before, but the moment he saw the woman\u2019s face turn pale, he couldn\u2019t explain the aching in his heart.\u2018What on earth\u2026\u2019\u00a0His face twisted as he tried to cope with the strange pain. Although he was angry, he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her. The unfamiliar sensation finally subsided when she mentioned someone unexpected.\u201cI\u2019m not clinging to him. I just want to get along with my father.\u201d As soon as Jubelian said this, Max\u2019s fierce, red eyes wavered.\u201cYou\u2019re planning to give them to your father, Duke Floyen?\u201d he asked for confirmation.Jubelian frowned. \u201cWho else would I give them to?\u201dMax felt his mood improve greatly.\u00a0\u2018It seems like she doesn\u2019t know how much he cares about her.\u2019\u00a0She had easily misunderstood his sharp words, which showed that they probably didn\u2019t get along well.\u00a0\u2018Is this what you wanted?\u2019\u00a0He silently ridiculed his foolish master, who had made countless sacrifices for his daughter but chose to keep this fact from her. Finding the situation both funny and pathetic, he chuckled.\u201cHey, stop laughing and say something.\u201d Jubelian sulked.\u2018If I don\u2019t listen to her\u2026 will she get upset again?\u2019\u00a0Max usually wouldn\u2019t think this far, but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her shocked face, which had turned pale from his biting words. He sighed and unconsciously hardened his expression.\u2018How annoying.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Writing a Letter to My FatherI had felt somewhat dispirited until I learned that we weren\u2019t talking about the same person.\u00a0\u2018Who was he thinking about, if not my father?\u2019At that moment, the man suddenly laughed. Although his handsome face was pleasing to the eye, it didn\u2019t make me feel any better.\u00a0\u2018Is he making fun of me?\u2019\u201cHey, say something,\u201d I responded brusquely, displeased by his rudeness.At my words, he stopped laughing and looked at me. His gaze was so serious that I became nervous.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018What does he want to say?\u2019\u201cThe gift is a set of cufflinks?\u201d he finally asked.\u201cYes, here they are.\u201dWhen I showed him the cufflinks, he frowned slightly. \u201cThey\u2019re not a very useful gift for a swordsman.\u201dI frowned.\u00a0\u2018Although I\u2019m not a swordsman, I think it\u2019s a good enough gift. Is he just trying to start a fight with me?\u2019\u201cYou must be very good at picking gifts,\u201d I said sarcastically.A smile appeared on his face.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s indeed handsome, but that\u2019s all he has.\u2019\u00a0My eyes lingered on him for a moment longer, captivated by the rare change in direction of his lips.\u201cI did give a present to my father a while ago.\u201d His smile was now faint on his stony face. \u201cHe looked bored these days, but it seems like he\u2019s more energetic now, thanks to my gift.\u201dUpon seeing his content expression, I guessed that he was a filial son.\u00a0\u2018But what kind of gift would help his father become more energetic?\u2019\u201cSo, what did you give him?\u201d I asked with sudden curiosity.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d he said sternly.\u2018Of course, he wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u2019\u00a0Although I hadn\u2019t expected an answer in the first place, I frowned at his disgusting personality.\u201cThe duke will like anything from you,\u201d he said.\u2018What, anything from me?\u2019\u00a0That was only possible if my father was possessed by someone warm and friendly. I was a little offended by his insincere answer.\u2018I guess he doesn\u2019t know my father well, even though he\u2019s his disciple.\u2019\u00a0I sighed.\u00a0\u2018But these cufflinks were expensive\u2026 I should give them to my father since I have to return the pendant anyway.\u2019If I didn\u2019t leave a note, he wouldn\u2019t know they were from me.\u00a0\u2018Since he\u2019s a workaholic, he will probably stop by his office first, right?\u2019\u00a0With this in mind, I decided to write a letter that would explain where the pendant and cufflinks came from before leaving everything in his office.* * *Four days had passed since the emperor called Duke Floyen to the Imperial Palace.\u2018Why are you taking so long, Duke Floyen?\u2019\u00a0Although more reinforcements were brought in, including the duke, who was guarding the Imperial Palace, the emperor couldn\u2019t be sure he was completely safe.\u2018I cannot be careless,\u2019\u00a0he reminded himself. If the duke betrayed him, the assassins would be able to easily attack him. He gritted his teeth.\u00a0\u2018If you betray me, everything you care about will crumble to dust, Regis.\u2019At that moment, the grand chamberlain entered the emperor\u2019s office. \u201cDuke Floyen has asked for a private meeting, Your Majesty.\u2018Of course, he would.\u2019\u00a0The emperor observed his ring with a smirk.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m very curious to know who the mastermind is.\u2019\u201cTell the duke that I will see him in the evening,\u201d he ordered sternly.Although he didn\u2019t have anything important going on right now, the emperor had a reason for stalling the meeting.\u00a0\u2018You made me anxious by taking this long to complete the task, so I\u2019ll also make you wait.\u2019At that moment, the grand chamberlain spoke carefully again. \u201cThere is another piece of news, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the emperor asked contently.The grand chamberlain swallowed nervously and said, \u201cSeveral officials have signed a petition calling for the return of His Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s eyes became fierce. \u201cBring it here.\u201dThe grand chamberlain delivered the petition to the emperor on a golden tray. When he read it, his expression contorted with anger.\u201cThese men must become torn to pieces! How dare they\u2026!\u201d He crumpled the petition and threw it to the floor. \u201cTo find a companion for the crown prince and educate him to become the next emperor? They\u2019ve gone mad!\u201dA twisted smile suddenly appeared on the emperor\u2019s face. \u201cThey dared to sign a petition like this when I\u2019m still in good shape. They must think too lightly of the throne.\u201dThe grand chamberlain swallowed nervously; the emperor\u2019s obsession with the throne was close to madness. He did his best not to provoke the emperor any further, afraid that his anger might fall on him as well.\u201cBring those impudent men in front of me right now,\u201d the emperor ordered coldly.\u201cYes, Your Majesty,\u201d the grand chamberlain replied complacently to avoid irritating him any further.* * *Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Writing a Letter to My FatherI grabbed my quill pen to begin writing the letter, then froze.\u2018Hm\u2026 what do people normally talk about with their fathers?\u2019\u00a0In my previous life, I was raised by a single mother. In my present life, I had an awkward relationship with my father.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t think Merilyn can help me with this, either\u2026\u2019I was deep in thought when I noticed my father\u2019s disciple staring at me with curiosity. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he replied with anticipation.\u201cOh, I\u2019m writing a letter.\u201d\u201cTo whom?\u201d\u201cTo my father.\u201dHis gaze softened slightly at my answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.\u201dI wanted to counter him, but it occurred to me that he was my father\u2019s disciple. He probably knew more about him.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t have any expectations\u2026 but\u2026\u2019\u00a0I set down my quill pen and called out to the man.\u201cHey.\u201d Although I wasn\u2019t sure if he was going to ignore me again, he responded quickly, as if he was in a good mood.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat do you usually talk about with my father?\u201d\u201cYou mean my master?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHe stroked his chin with an upright posture for a while, then leaned back on the couch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. We don\u2019t talk much.\u201dI was disappointed by his abrupt answer.\u00a0\u2018Well, both of them aren\u2019t talkative, so that\u2019s to be expected.\u2019After deciding that it was futile to rely on others for this matter, I began to write the letter by myself.\u00a0\u2018In my previous life, I volunteered for public institutions and had a lot of experience writing for official matters, as well as writing with penpals. It should be fine.\u2019My letter was completed not long after.\u00a0\u2018This should be good, right?\u2019\u00a0I read through it and didn\u2019t find any mistakes.\u00a0\u2018Since I worked hard, I\u2019m going to eat something delicious now.\u2019As I silently praised myself, I heard my father\u2019s disciple speak behind me. \u201cAre you really going to give that to him?\u201d he asked with surprise.\u201cYes,\u201d I replied earnestly, then took another look at my letter.Dear Father,How have you been? To think that I\u2019m all grown up with my 19th birthday around the corner\u2026 Time flies by, doesn\u2019t it? During the hectic years that have passed by, it\u2019s common to forget important things.Did you not lose your pendant a while ago? I just want to let you know that I had it. I should\u2019ve given it back to you earlier, but this was delayed due to unavoidable circumstances. I hope you understand. These cufflinks are a gift for being patient with me.I apologize again for not returning your pendant earlier due to personal reasons.Sincerely,Jubelian Eloy Floyen.\u2018I think this is good. I admitted my faults and asked for forgiveness, so he cannot be angry at me.\u2019\u00a0The letter was also clear to the point, so I was certain that my father was going to let this incident slide.\u201cHis reaction would be an interesting sight to see.\u201d My father\u2019s disciple smirked, but I assumed he just envious that I was able to write an acceptable letter without his help.\u201cI\u2019m going to go to his office and come back. You know what to do if someone tries to enter the room, right?\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d Despite his response, he nodded at my request. After his initial hostility, it was a little odd to see him show some consideration for me.* * *Duke Regis Floyen visited the emperor\u2019s office even later than the scheduled time and bowed at his superior.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou came later than I told you to,\u201d the emperor scolded Regis, who wore an indifferent expression.\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018What a shameless person.\u2019\u00a0The emperor became irritated by Regis\u2019s stoic confidence, which never wavered even in unfavorable circumstances. He struggled to maintain his composure before speaking.\u201cSo, did you figure out the vile rat who is behind all this?\u201d the emperor demanded.Regis smiled instead of revealing the truth.\u00a0\u2018Max had also called my daughter a rat\u2026 I guess this is retribution.\u2019\u00a0He had known for a while that the assassinations were the work of his one and only disciple, who was skilled at both swordsmanship and manipulation. Although Max despised the emperor and hoped that he would clash with his master, he miscalculated Regis\u2019s patience.\u201cI could not find who was behind the assassinations.\u201dThe emperor frowned. \u201cAre you serious? If you didn\u2019t accomplish my order, then why\u2026\u201dAs he angrily went on, Regis recalled his disciple\u2019s words:\u00a0\u201cAre you possibly afraid of a weak guy like him?\u201d\u2018No, I\u2019m only letting the emperor live because it\u2019s not the right time yet,\u2019\u00a0the duke thought. When that time came, his prey wouldn\u2019t be able to run away no matter how he tried.\u00a0\u2018Soon,\u2019\u00a0he promised himself. Then he looked at the emperor with calm, blue eyes that didn\u2019t betray a hint of anger.\u201cDon\u2019t you know why, Your Majesty?\u201d Regis asked.The emperor found it difficult to breathe under Regis\u2019s burdensome gaze.\u00a0\u2018Is he trying to start a rebellion\u2026!\u2019\u00a0Overwhelmed by fear, he wasn\u2019t able to respond for a while. It was Regis who finally broke the silence.\u201cAs long as I stay at the Imperial Palace, they won\u2019t attack you.\u201dThere was no sign of reproach in his calm voice, but the emperor, who had felt the weight of his monstrous energy, felt as if he had heard a thousand criticisms from him. He clenched his fists with resentment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - An Unexpected Turn of EventsThe emperor glared at the duke and raised his voice. \u201cHow can you guarantee that when I was already attacked?\u201dLittle did he know, the duke could guarantee it because he was certain that his disciple, the mastermind behind the assassinations, wasn\u2019t going to act rashly from now on.\u00a0\u2018As long as I stay calm, Max knows there won\u2019t be a revolution even if he pushes the emperor towards the extreme.\u2019\u201cTell me right now!\u201d the emperor shouted. Even now, he was causing a ruckus, oblivious to the machinations that brewed below the surface. He was a rather easy man to manipulate by nature.In response, Regis let out a small sigh. \u201cYour Majesty has become increasingly guarded, so the mastermind probably realized that sending out more assassins would be futile,\u201d he replied vaguely.Although Regis spoke kindly, the emperor regarded his words as an implication that he himself was frightened of the assassinations.\u00a0\u2018How dare he\u2026!\u2019\u00a0He fumed with resentment, but the duke continued.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to act rashly in this situation, seeing as it has already attracted a lot of attention from people.\u201dEvery word he said was right, but the emperor refused to admit it. Doing so meant admitting defeat.\u2018That vile rogue. He\u2019s running his mouth to cover up his incompetence.\u2019\u00a0The emperor was filled with indignation, but he calmed down by stroking the ring on his finger.\u00a0\u2018No, as long as I have this\u2026 he cannot disobey me.\u2019Even so, he couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous. The duke didn\u2019t seem concerned about this weakness anymore; in fact, he hadn\u2019t in a long time.\u00a0\u2018Since I can\u2019t be sure, I should find something else that could oppose him\u2026\u2019At that moment, the prime minister\u2019s advice came to mind.\u00a0\u201cIf you want to keep him in check, you must bring His Highness the Crown Prince back to the capital,\u201d\u00a0he had said.The emperor had finally found use for his son, who he always thought of as a terrible existence that threatened his place on the throne.\u00a0\u2018Yes, it\u2019s a good idea to make him keep this atrocious man in check. He won\u2019t suspect anything if I act like I\u2019m going to give the throne to him.\u2019\u201cI realize my personal affair has bothered you, duke,\u201d the emperor said in a relatively mild tone.His subjects would usually refuse to admit such a bold claim, but the duke didn\u2019t respond. It was like a silent affirmation. The emperor clenched his fists, barely controlling his urge to throw something at him.\u201cSeeing as the mastermind might still be observing the situation, shouldn\u2019t you guard the palace for at least a week, Duke Floyen? Please work hard for three more days.\u201dAt this last-notice command, Regis bowed at the emperor. \u201cYes, I will do my best to serve you, Your Majesty.\u201dAs soon as Regis left the office, he heard the sound of something breaking. Despite the commotion, he wore a slightly pleasant expression on his handsome face.\u2018I\u2019m getting bored of his predictability.\u2019\u00a0Regis tilted back his head to stare at the sky with weary eyes. When he saw the moon glowing in the dark sky, a hint of warmth colored his frozen expression.\u2018I wonder if my child is doing well.\u2019If he stayed in the palace for a little longer, the people would blame the emperor for mistreating him. The duke also wanted to go back home to see his daughter.\u2018Jubell.\u2019It had only been four days since he left the mansion, but Regis couldn\u2019t wait to go back home and see how she was doing.* * *\u2018It\u2019s quiet.\u2019\u00a0The office without my father was far emptier than I thought it would be.\u2018I didn\u2019t know his absence would make it seem so deserted.\u2019Even so, I was relieved that my father wasn\u2019t here. I would be too mortified to give the letter to him in person.\u2018He\u2019ll read it if I put it over there, right?\u2019\u00a0I walked towards his desk. When I saw an open ink bottle, I secured the lid so it wouldn\u2019t dry up. As I wondered where I should put the letter, I glanced over a stray piece of paper without much thought.\u2018Huh? A prospective marriage partner list?\u2019\u00a0I wondered if I had seen it correctly, so I carefully read it from the top to be sure. The list clearly contained the names of noblemen around my age.\u2018Why did he make this list without confiding in me\u2026?\u2019I suddenly remembered the conversation I had with him after I broke up with Mikhail.\u00a0\u201cWhat is your ideal type?\u201d\u00a0he had said.\u2018No way\u2026 is he actually trying to find a man with all the conditions I mentioned?\u2019\u00a0I looked at the list with trembling eyes. Among the many names, some were underlined.\u00a0\u2018Is he really trying to set up extravagant blind dates with these distinguished men?\u2019One of the underlined names was the son of a foreign royal family. Another one was Lord Frederich, the only son of Duke Elios, the prime minister. Although his family was wealthier than Mikhail\u2019s, he was the supporting character of another supporting character who didn\u2019t even appear in the original novel.For a brief moment, I thought it might be a good idea to marry one of these men and live happily ever after. Doing so would allow me to live comfortably, as well as escape my predestined death.\u2018Lord Frederich has good qualifications and good looks. He\u2019s probably the best choice that I could ask for.\u2019\u00a0Even so, I had no intention of changing my mind about getting married. The moment I did, I would have to live as that man\u2019s wife and not as myself, Jubelian.\u2018It\u2019s reassuring that both of these underlined names are from families that are just as wealthy as ours because I had asked my father for someone whose wealth exceeded ours.\u2019I could only think of one family that was qualified in this aspect.\u00a0\u2018But there\u2019s no reason for us to get involved with them, so that\u2019s a relief.\u2019I continued to skim through the list with a smile on my face until I stumbled upon a circled name.\u00a0\u2018Huh? Why did my father mark this?\u2019\u00a0When I looked closer with curiosity, I ended up dropping the paper I was holding.\u2018Maximillian Casein Assiette?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - An Unexpected Turn of EventsI couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. This man was the heir of the only family that was wealthier than the Floyen House, and the person who was going to kill me in the future\u2026\u2018Why is the crown prince\u2019s name here?\u2019I remembered a part of the novel that encapsulated the crown prince as\u00a0\u2018a psychopath who neither sheds blood nor tears.\u2019\u00a0Although this sounded harsh, it probably didn\u2019t even do him justice.\u2018I heard that he doesn\u2019t hesitate to kill people\u2026\u2019\u00a0There were quite a few anecdotes about the crown prince\u2019s cruelty. One of them was about the time he sent an assassin\u2019s severed head to his sister, Beatrice, as a gift for her coming-of-age ceremony.That one incident was enough to prove how insane he was, but his atrocities didn\u2019t end there. At the beginning of the novel, he sent assassins to kill the emperor. He wasn\u2019t just a psychopath, but a wicked man who seemed to have split personalities; a purely tyrannical character in the novel who shed neither blood nor tears.\u2018If his name is circled, that probably means he\u2019s going to be my partner\u2026\u2019\u00a0I became dizzy by this thought and barely supported myself when I stumbled.\u2018No matter how much I think about it, isn\u2019t this too cruel? Even other nobles try to avoid marrying their daughter off to the crown prince\u2026\u2019Although the crown princess\u2019 position was usually sought after, there was another reason why it was left vacant. At the beginning of the novel, bizarre rumors about the burn scar on his face circulated, which explained why the crown prince always wore a helmet.\u2018What\u2019s more\u2026\u2019\u00a0Yes, there was another rumor that didn\u2019t concern his appearance. It was that he was a sadist who was violent in bed.These rumors caused many noblewomen to hasten their marriages with other men to avoid getting engaged with the crown prince. So did their parents, who didn\u2019t wish for their daughters to marry a man with such a violent temper, even if he was the crown prince.\u2018In the memories of my future, he even visited me in prison!\u2019\u00a0In the novel, Jubelian had ended her life to avoid being tortured. She thought it was better to die than fall victim to his vices.\u2018Is my father really trying to sell me to this terrible man?\u2019\u00a0I gritted my teeth. Although I had asked for someone who excelled in terms of wealth, competence, and fame, this was just too much.\u2018He forgot about the most important thing too\u2026 I definitely mentioned appearance, Father.\u2019\u00a0The crown prince always covered his face, so no one knew what he looked like. But even if he was attractive enough to meet my standards, I still wanted nothing to do with him.\u2018My life will be in danger if I marry him. But the more urgent problem is\u2026\u2019\u00a0My head started to hurt as I mulled over my predicament. I could reject other noblemen because I was the daughter of an esteemed duke, but I couldn\u2019t reject someone from the imperial family. If I was set up on a blind date with the crown prince\u2026 I couldn\u2019t refuse to go.\u2018Of course, the prince has to like me for us to get married\u2026\u2019\u00a0But if he was truly a psychopath like he was rumored to be, it didn\u2019t matter who his partner was; it would be enough for him to have someone to harass.\u2018The most I can do is to change my father\u2019s mind about the crown prince\u2026 but that\u2019s not going to be easy.\u2019\u00a0I sighed and placed the paper back on the desk.\u2018I have to come up with a countermeasure without letting my father know that I saw this list.\u2019\u00a0Otherwise, he might hasten the blind date so that I wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid it. For this reason, I left his office with the letter, cufflinks, and pendant back in hand.* * *\u2018Was her room always this spacious?\u2019\u00a0Max looked around the desolate quarters and sat on the chair the woman always used.\u2018It\u2019s uncomfortable.\u2019\u00a0Nevertheless, he slumped into the chair, feeling strangely weak.\u2018When will she come back?\u2019He rarely talked with the woman when she was around, but now that her constant presence was gone, he didn\u2019t know how much longer he could endure being alone. He felt a strange sense of emptiness in the desolate room.\u2018Why is she taking so long?\u2019\u00a0Max looked at the door with forlorn eyes when he suddenly became alert.\u2018Someone\u2019s here.\u2019\u00a0His gaze snapped towards the open window that faced the balcony. He moved so fast that the culprit lost track of him for an instant before he reappeared.\u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Max grabbed the unwelcome visitor by the neck, firm even as the man gasped and struggled in his hostile hold. \u201cI asked who you are!\u201d\u201cPlease let me\u2026 argh\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat business do you have here?\u201d Max tightened his grip.\u201cMadam sent for\u2026!\u201d The man squirmed and spoke with difficulty.When Max released his grip, the man collapsed like a loosened marionette and coughed.He stared at the man, then asked coldly, \u201cHow did you know that I was here?\u201d\u201cMadam said you might be here\u2026\u201d When the man trailed off, Max furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cSo, what do you want?\u201dThe man managed to catch his breath and replied, \u201cWe received a report saying that the emperor\u2019s movements have been unusual.\u201dMax smirked. \u201cYes, he should be busy trying to keep himself alive.\u201dIn response, the man shook his head and said, \u201cI was told that he was impatiently calling for the return of the crown prince, at the advice of the prime minister and officials.\u201d Max stared at him without saying a word. \u201cI think you should head back to the palace right away, Prince Maximillian,\u201d the man said.Max knew that he should quickly leave the mansion because this was an urgent matter, but for some reason, he didn\u2019t move a muscle and stayed rooted to his spot.\u2018Do I really have to leave now?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was filled with worries about the woman, who might look for him if he disappeared without a word.\u201cWait for me outside. It\u2019ll just take a second.\u201dThe man noticed that the prince possessed an unfamiliar expression and a hesitant gaze, but he silently obeyed his orders and left the room. Max exhaled when he couldn\u2019t feel his subordinate\u2019s presence in the room anymore.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing something like this\u2026\u2019He went to the woman\u2019s desk, pulled out a piece of paper, and began writing diligently.\u2018This should be enough.\u2019\u00a0His taut face relaxed.* * *It was eerily quiet when I came back to my room.\u2018It seems like he\u2019s hiding well. I\u2019m proud of him,\u2019\u00a0I thought to myself as I walked towards my closet.\u00a0\u2018I hope he\u2019s not annoyed at me for taking a long time.\u2019I opened the closet door.\u00a0\u2018Huh?\u2019\u00a0Instead of a frowning man huddled among tulles, I only saw my clothes.\u2018Did he hide somewhere else?\u2019\u00a0I searched through my other closets, but he was nowhere to be found.\u2018Where did he go? I already have a lot on my mind right now\u2026\u2019\u00a0I was about to place my father\u2019s letter on my desk before searching for him elsewhere when I saw a piece of paper with scribbled words.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019\u00a0I inspected the letter with a strange sense of foreboding and frowned.\u00a0\u2018The handwriting is horrible. Even a cat can write better than this.\u2019I concentrated on the content of the letter and read what it said:\u00a0Don\u2019t look for me. I\u2019ll come back when the time comes.\u201cI never told him he could come again.\u201d I sighed unconsciously and sprawled on the couch that he used to occupy.\u2018I finally got my place back.\u2019\u00a0I relaxed on the comfortable couch, which was still warm from his body heat. It felt as if I had gone back to my quiet and peaceful days.\u2018He said he would return, but when will that be?\u2019\u00a0I pondered over what he wrote but quickly came up with an explanation.\u00a0\u2018He probably intends to come back to see my father, so it has nothing to do with me.\u2019I frowned when my head started to ache.\u00a0\u2018Ah, I\u2019m really tired.\u2019\u00a0I was drained from worrying about how to avoid the disaster that was the crown prince, my prospective partner.\u2018What should I do now?\u2019\u00a0Although I was anxious, the fatigue that weighed down on my body was persistent. I closed my eyes.* * *When Max left the duke\u2019s mansion, his body tensed and his senses sharpened.\u2018I\u2019m back to how I used to be.\u2019\u00a0He faltered.\u00a0\u2018That woman. I wonder if she read my letter.\u2019Max unconsciously looked back at the duke\u2019s mansion. When he spotted the marble building, he realized what he had done and twisted his face.\u2018A letter\u2026\u2019\u00a0It was unlike him to leave such a thing.\u00a0\u2018Why did I do that?\u2019When he was a child, Max learned that carelessness directly led to death, so he was always vigilant. But strangely, his days in the woman\u2019s room had not been spent in perpetual alertness. He had even been defenseless several times without realizing it.\u2018If my subordinate didn\u2019t come, I might have continued staying there.\u2019\u00a0Max couldn\u2019t understand this change in heart; it was as if he had been placed under a spell. He wondered if the woman had a secret method to make him feel this way, but didn\u2019t dwell on it for long.\u2018First, I need to go back and do something.\u2019\u00a0Max fastened his pace and headed towards his destination.Act 4. Who Will Be My Partner?\u2018Hm\u2026 why is it so bright?\u2019\u00a0I glanced at the clock in my half-awake state and was startled to see the time. Although I had only planned to sleep for a short while, I had fallen into a deep slumber!I worried about my father\u2019s disciple, who depended on me for food.\u00a0\u2018He must\u2019ve been hungry, so why didn\u2019t he wake me up\u2026?\u2019\u2018Oh.\u2019\u00a0I realized that habits were hard to break, seeing as I was looking for someone who had left yesterday.\u2018Since he left so abruptly, he probably found another place to stay\u2026\u2019\u00a0I had already packed up some travel necessities for him in advance, but I didn\u2019t expect him to leave so abruptly.\u2018He could\u2019ve at least said goodbye.\u2019\u00a0I quickly replaced my frown with a smile.\u00a0\u2018I shouldn\u2019t be sad.

I didn\u2019t want her to think that I was behaving suspiciously.\u2018I wonder when Father is coming back. I hope it won\u2019t be sooner than expected\u2026\u2019\u00a0It would be terrible if my father came back when I hadn\u2019t devised a plan to escape the marriage yet.I trembled as I imagined that situation and said, \u201cUm, Merilyn, did my father say when he would come back by any chance?\u201dMerilyn flinched and shook her head. \u201cNo, but I think he\u2019ll return in two days.\u201dI became reassured by what she said.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t need to be so hasty.

Jubelian used to frequently wander around the mansion, but now she spent most of her time in her room. It was even more unusual that she restricted the maids from entering her room.The butler sighed with worry.\u00a0\u2018She started behaving like this after the master left for training.\u2019\u00a0Because his return was delayed, five days had passed in his absence. The servants in the Floyen household interacted with the lady with great care, anxious that she might return to her old, unreasonable self.\u2018Master must return soon\u2026\u2019\u00a0Derrick sighed again. His worries were interrupted by Madam Perez, the head of housekeeping.\u201cIs it true that the master will be back in two days, Derrick?\u201d\u201cYes. Why do you ask\u2026?\u201dMadam Perez sighed. \u201cThe girl who takes care of Lady Floyen told me she was acting strange again.\u201d\u201cStrange? Can you elaborate\u2026?\u201d Derrick trailed off and looked at her with wavering eyes.\u201cShe said that Lady Floyen asked when the master would return with a pallid face,\u201d Madam Perez replied.\u201cWhat?\u201d Derrick was shocked. What she had just told him reminded him of a certain day in the distant past.\u201cDerrick, why isn\u2019t daddy coming back?\u201d\u00a0Jubelian had asked him. His heart still ached when he remembered her tearful, periwinkle eyes.\u00a0\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done that back then,\u2019\u00a0he thought.Derrick sighed with regret and said, \u201cI will contact master right away.\u201dMadam Perez sighed as well and nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d* * *\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs the wind blew through the open window, Merilyn heard Jubelian sigh in the middle of reading a book on her couch. Although her face was full of worries, she was still beautiful.\u2018Lady Floyen must be sighing because she misses master, right?\u2019\u00a0She looked so sad that Merilyn couldn\u2019t help but strike a conversation with her.\u201cThe weather is so nice today, my lady.\u201d\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Jubelian replied weakly.Merilyn looked at her with pity.\u00a0\u2018This is the first time I\u2019ve seen her look so weak.\u2019\u00a0Although she was in higher spirits these days because Jubelian was treating everyone so kindly, she was now worried about the despondent lady.\u2018I want to help her.\u2019\u00a0Although this was a presumptuous thought, one that might even reignite Jubelian\u2019s temper, she felt the urge to do something.\u201cHow about taking a walk, my lady? Basking in the warm sunlight will surely make you feel better.\u201dJubelian looked up. Although she gazed at her calmly, Merilyn became frightened.\u00a0\u2018Oh no\u2026 What if she becomes angry at me?\u2019She had gathered up her courage to speak, but she was still afraid that Jubelian might get angry since the lady was known for being fickle. Merilyn looked down nervously.Jubelian parted her red lips. \u201cAlright.\u201dMerilyn looked at her, dumbfounded.\u00a0\u2018She agreed with me so easily?\u2019\u00a0Then she heard her voice again.\u201cI do feel a little suffocated, staying inside all the time.\u201dMerilyn suddenly recalled something Jubelian had said in the past.\u201cI hate being home. Daddy is never here\u2026 and I\u2019m always alone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Father\u2019s ReturnMerilyn looked at Jubelian with pity.\u2018Lady Floyen\u2026\u2019\u00a0Although it wasn\u2019t too long ago that she had been subject to her violent episodes, Merilyn felt sympathetic when she remembered Jubelian\u2019s lonely childhood.\u2018She used to be a violent and perverse person, but the more I got to know her, the more I found that she\u2019s actually a considerate person.\u2019\u00a0Merilyn felt rather attached to Jubelian now, so she couldn\u2019t bear to leave her in low spirits.\u201cI will always stay by your side, my lady.\u201d When she expressed her heartfelt thoughts for the first time, the corner of Jubelian\u2019s lips raised slightly.\u201cThank you.\u201d Although her smile looked lovely on her youthful face, it also contained a hint of sorrow.Merilyn thought about her plan with conviction.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s not enough to say that\u2026 I have to cheer her up,\u2019\u00a0she decided.* * *\u201cThe crown prince just sent a message saying that it will take longer for him to return due to a problem at the border, Your Majesty.\u201dThe emperor gritted his teeth.\u00a0\u2018That vile Maximillian. If I tell you to come here, you should come here immediately. Why are you taking so long?\u2019His son was already an eyesore, so it didn\u2019t help that he was resisting an imperial order.\u00a0\u2018I will make sure to give you a hard time when you arrive.\u2019\u00a0The emperor felt a surge of anger as he thought about his arrogant child. He continued to grit his teeth when his office door opened roughly.Bang!\u201cY-Your Grace! You can\u2019t\u2026\u201d The royal guards tried to restrain the intruder, but they were no match for the skillful man. He easily traversed the line of guards and soon stood before the emperor.\u201cGreetings, Your Majesty.\u201dThe emperor, who had barely calmed down after learning about his son\u2019s disobedience, witnessed Duke Floyen\u2019s impudence and flushed with anger again. \u201cWhat on earth do you think you are doing?\u201dRegis bowed his head without a hint of fear. \u201cI came here to have an urgent word with you.\u201d\u201cSo, what\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201d the emperor asked coldly, showing that he would not let the duke\u2019s rashness slide if it wasn\u2019t important.Regis looked at the emperor with determination. \u201cI caught wind of the assassins who troubled Your Majesty these past few days.\u201dThe emperor widened his eyes. \u201cWhat? Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen bring the culprits to me!\u201dRegis shook his head. \u201cI will need to go back home to find more clues,\u201d he said softly.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cI suspect an intruder visited my mansion while I was away.\u201dThe emperor twisted his face. \u201cWhat? What does that have to do with the assassin who tried to kill me?\u201d\u201cThe intruder\u2019s footwork was similar to the assassin who infiltrated the palace.\u201dThe emperor glared at Regis. He knew that this was just an excuse for him to leave the palace.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018How dare he try to make a fool out of me\u2026!\u2019\u00a0Even so, the emperor himself had ordered the duke to head the investigation. Now that he had presented reasonable evidence, he had no choice but to grant his request.Regis met the emperor\u2019s piercing gaze and raised the corner of his lips as if he knew what he was thinking. \u201cIn order to acquire more clues, please grant me the permission to leave the palace.\u201d* * *Ah, even people need sunlight once in a while. Although I enjoyed spending the past few days in my room, I could feel my energy slowly draining away.\u00a0\u2018Yes, this would be a more productive place to think about a countermeasure for father\u2019s plan.\u2019Merilyn interrupted my thoughts. \u201cAren\u2019t the flowers very pretty, my lady?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dEven though I had replied shortly, Merilyn looked at me patiently and said, \u201cThe flowers are pretty, but you\u2019re even more beautiful, my lady.\u201dIt was a bit burdensome for Merilyn to follow me around and shower me with nonsensical compliments.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s been strange recently. Has she been working too much?\u2019\u00a0As I pondered over whether I should give her a vacation, I found a bench at the side of the garden and sat down.\u2018Let me think about this matter first. There are only two days left until father returns.\u2019\u00a0Although I thought of it as \u2018only\u2019 two days, that was enough time for me to formulate a plan. It would look strange if I was staring into space, so I opened the book that I brought with me.\u2018Oh, it\u2019s the military tactics book.\u2019\u00a0Although it was very entertaining, I wasn\u2019t in the best situation to be reading a book that my father had recommended.\u201cAh, will you be reading a book, my lady?\u201d Merilyn stared at me with widened eyes, as if it was a strange thing for me to do outside.\u201cYes, it\u2019s perfect for spending some time alone.\u201dMerilyn observed me when I said the word \u2018alone,\u2019 then lowered her head. \u201cBut, my lady\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll head inside when I\u2019m done, so you can go ahead,\u201d I said politely, not wanting to directly order her to leave me alone so I could read quietly. At that moment, someone spoke up. It was a familiar voice, but one that I certainly didn\u2019t expect to hear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Father\u2019s Return\u201cJubelian.\u201dAt my name, I reflexively turned towards the speaker. My father, who I had hoped would return two days later, was standing in front of me.\u00a0\u2018Why is he here?!\u2019I tried to keep calm and said, \u201cWelcome back, Father.\u201dHe stared at me as I struggled to gather my words. \u201cThank you,\u201d he finally said.\u201cYou must be tired from the training. Why don\u2019t you get some rest?\u201d I began to get up from the bench to avoid spending more time with him, but he gently placed his hand on my shoulder.\u201cNo, I have something that I need to say right now.\u201dI observed him with trembling eyes and became aware of my predicament.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m ruined\u2026\u2019\u201cJubelian,\u201d my father said. As he gazed at me with cold eyes, I braced myself for his next words.\u2018He\u2019s taking his time to get to the point. It\u2019s obvious what he wants to talk about.\u2019\u00a0When I made up my mind to steer the topic away from the marriage list, my father took his hand off my shoulder.\u201cFrom now on\u2026 you won\u2019t be left alone,\u201d he said quietly.I doubted having heard him correctly.\u00a0\u2018What does he mean by that?\u2019\u00a0He didn\u2019t even mention the person who wouldn\u2019t leave me alone, but I was soon able to come up with various explanations.\u2018Is he going to keep me under surveillance, so I won\u2019t be able to run away from the marriage?\u2019\u00a0As I imagined such possibilities, I looked at him with confusion.He stared at me and asked, \u201cHave you eaten dinner?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I replied truthfully to his sudden question.My father furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cIf you keep skipping meals, you will pass out again.\u201dIt seemed like he was worried about me, but I knew better.\u00a0\u2018If I keep passing out, it will be difficult to marry me off to the crown prince\u2026 He just wants me to be in prime condition for marriage.\u2019I was wondering if I should pass out at a social event to ruin his plans when he said, \u201cYou must never pass out again.\u201dHe sounded like he was going to punish me if I did, so I discarded this idea.\u00a0\u2018Ah, maybe there\u2019s a limit to what I can do.\u2019\u00a0As I lamented to myself for being the villainess in this novel, my father took my hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201dI wasn\u2019t hungry because of all the snacks I ate earlier, but I didn\u2019t refuse him out of worry that he might get upset.\u00a0\u2018I must eat dinner with him to avoid trouble.\u2019I convinced myself to hold my father\u2019s hand. Although he was cruel for trying to marry me off to a tyrant prince, his hand was big and warm.\u2018When I was little, I used to follow him around\u2026 just because I wanted to hold this hand.\u2019\u00a0It was amusing that I couldn\u2019t hold his hand when I desperately wanted to, but I could now that I had let all lingering attachments go.\u00a0\u2018He doesn\u2019t mean anything to me anymore.\u2019I let him guide me into the dining room. The time it took us to get here felt longer than usual.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u2018This is really awkward,\u2019\u00a0I thought as I followed his order.Although this wasn\u2019t the first time I was dining with my father, we usually didn\u2019t talk when we were eating. Our silence became so ingrained that I didn\u2019t find it awkward, but today was different because\u2026\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m anticipating what he\u2019s going to say.\u2019When I sighed, my father said, \u201cI heard that you are going to a banquet next week.\u201dIt was obvious why he suddenly mentioned Rose\u2019s birthday party.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s going to criticize my decision to go.\u2019I collected my thoughts. \u201cYes,\u201d I replied with a smile. \u201cI was invited to a birthday banquet hosted by Rose Mario Arlo, the esteemed daughter of Count Arlo.\u201dMy dad raised his knife and gracefully sliced his steak. \u201cWho will your partner be?\u201dIn the book that my father had given me, several tactics could be employed in conversations. One method was to disturb the opponent\u2019s emotions. Another, the standard method, was precise in that it cut to the chase and kept the opponent from escaping. Of all methods, my father had used the standard one on me!He wouldn\u2019t find fault with me if I had a partner, but the problem was\u2026\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t have one yet.\u2019\u00a0It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t try. Although it was more comfortable to be alone, I didn\u2019t want to stick out in the cliquish and conservative aristocratic social scene.\u2018Several people even wanted to be my partner. All I had to do was choose one\u2026\u2019\u00a0There was a reason why I didn\u2019t, however. After seeing the marriage list, I became so occupied with finding a countermeasure that it had completely slipped my mind.I smiled awkwardly at my father.\u00a0\u2018Ah, what should I say now?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Partner for the BanquetI tried to calm myself down first. If I showed any sign of uneasiness, Father might take advantage of that and talk about the marriage list.\u00a0\u2018I must not panic and respond steadily at times like this.\u2019\u00a0When I effectively gained control over my emotions, I feigned ignorance. \u201cAh, I haven\u2019t decided on my partner yet,\u201d I said. My father stared at me. His observant gaze was so uncomfortable that I suddenly lost my appetite. Instead of becoming agitated, I casually said, \u201cThere are quite a few people who wrote to me, asking to be my partner. They\u2019re all wonderful, so it\u2019s been difficult to make a decision.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d my father said quietly after staring at me for a while longer. The sound of his silverware resumed.\u2018Did I just successfully defend myself?\u2019\u00a0I let out a soft sigh of relief. The rest of the dinner was accompanied by a series of dizzying questions from my father, but as long as he didn\u2019t mention the marriage list, it could be considered a success.\u00a0\u2018I should also take a look at the letters after I finish eating.\u2019\u00a0I decided to quickly finish my food, so I could head back to my room and find a partner.\u201cJubelian.\u201d At the sound of his voice, I became nervous and inhaled sharply. He might mention the marriage list after all.\u201cYes?\u201d I managed to ask. His piercing gaze seemed to urge me to meet the crown prince at once. I unconsciously swallowed and tried to breathe through the thick tension. As my father continued to stare at me, he cut a piece of his juicy steak and placed it on my plate.\u00a0\u2018All of a sudden\u2026?\u2019\u00a0Although I would have normally declined it, there was a problem.\u00a0\u2018Out of everything on his plate, why did it have to be meat\u2026\u2019During these past few days, I hadn\u2019t been able to eat properly because of my father\u2019s disciple. The maids would have found it suspicious if I had asked them to bring me two sets of silverware, so I had ordered finger foods. As a result, I was craving meat. The problem was that I couldn\u2019t afford to stay in the same room with my father any longer, as it would increase the chances of him mentioning the marriage list.\u2018I must\u2026 decline\u2026\u2019\u00a0My determination faltered when the steak\u2019s savory aroma suddenly entered my nose.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019ll surely melt in my mouth if I eat it, right?\u2019As I worried about what to do, my father said firmly, \u201cEat.\u201d\u2018Since he\u2019s telling me to eat, I guess I have no choice. He might get upset with me if I don\u2019t listen.\u2019When I came to this decision, I took a bite of the steak without hesitation. The soft meat immediately melted in my mouth, exuding rich juices. It was exactly the high-quality taste that I had been salivating over these past few days. Although I was deeply immersed in the flavor, my troubles didn\u2019t end there.\u201cEat slowly. You\u2019ll get sick.\u201dMy father was the only reason I would get sick, but I didn\u2019t dare to tell him this. I continued to eat quietly.* * *As soon as I finished eating, I went to my room and checked the letters I received.\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s one from the esteemed son of Count Rowen, Sir Boromir, and another one from the esteemed son of Marquis Crocus.\u2019I was startled that so many respectable people had requested to be my partner. It didn\u2019t make sense at first, considering my social reputation, but then I remembered my lofty status as the duke\u2019s daughter. Many people would seek me out, just to have an excuse to meet him.\u2018Thanks to my father, it won\u2019t be so hard to choose a partner.\u2019\u00a0It was ironic that he was the very reason I could avoid the predicament he had placed me in. I sighed in relief, eager to finally resolve this annoying problem of choosing a partner.\u2018But who should I choose?\u2019\u00a0As a member of the Imperial Knights, Sir Boromir was popular for his excellent swordsmanship, manners, and decent looks. Another candidate, Count Rowen\u2019s son, was famous for his beautiful appearance. The last candidate, Marquis Crocus\u2019s son, was the successor of a wealthy and well-known family. He would also lead the Foreign Ministry in the future. All three of these men were worth more than my terrible social reputation. If someone else heard about my dilemma, they would think I was bragging.\u2018The esteemed son of Marquis Crocus did ask first, but\u2026 I would like someone who is least likely to cause trouble in the future.\u2019\u00a0I made a decision quicker than I had anticipated. There was no way someone as handsome and capable as Marquis Crocus\u2019s son would ask to be my partner without an underlying motive. For this reason, I chose the esteemed son of Count Rowen, who had nothing but his appearance, which was handsome enough to be compared to Mikhail.\u2018In the end, it\u2019s best to have a handsome partner.\u2019\u00a0I made up my mind and wrote a letter to the esteemed son of Count Rowen, permitting him to take me as his partner for the banquet. Then I gave it to Merilyn.\u201cIt\u2019s too late today, so please send it tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201dNow that this problem had been solved, I was relieved that my father hadn\u2019t mentioned anything else to me. Writing the letter quickly drained my energy.\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s something else I need to do\u2026 but I\u2019m so sleepy.\u2019I eventually gave up trying to stay awake. As soon as I rolled into bed, I fell into a deep slumber.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - Partner for the BanquetWhen Jubelian fell asleep, the maids turned off the lights and left her room. They were startled to find someone waiting for them at the door.\u201cMaster!\u201dThey soon heard the duke\u2019s indifferent voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jubelian?\u201d he asked.Merilyn, who was expected to answer as Jubelian\u2019s head maid, gulped nervously.\u00a0\u2018Master rarely comes all the way to Lady Floyen\u2019s room. He must have something urgent to tell her.\u2019\u201cPlease wait a moment. I will let the lady know that you\u2019re looking for you,\u201d she said after coming to this conclusion. Merilyn was about to go back into Jubelian\u2019s room and wake her up, but the duke shook his head.\u201cNo, just leave her be.\u201dIn response, Merilyn lowered her head and asked politely, \u201cCould you tell me what kind of business you have to discuss with the lady, Master? If it\u2019s something I can answer, I will.\u201dAt the word \u2018business,\u2019 the duke looked at the door to his daughter\u2019s room blankly. \u201cDid she choose a partner for the banquet?\u201d he asked.Merilyn nodded with a cheerful expression. \u201cAh, yes! She has decided to go with Mister Edmund, the esteemed son of Count Rowen. Isn\u2019t that great?At the name of the handsome man who was well-known in high society, Regis murmured to himself for a bit. \u201cI see\u2026\u201d he finally said. When he returned to his room, he recalled how uncomfortable his daughter looked during dinner.\u201cThere are quite a few people who wrote to me, asking to be my partner. They\u2019re all wonderful, so it\u2019s been difficult to make a decision.\u201dRegis sighed, recalling how she had used the word \u2018wonderful.\u2019\u2018I\u2019d better check him out myself,\u2019\u00a0he decided.* * *It was late in the day. Count Rowen was tense due to the appearance of an unexpected visitor. Even his second son, a usually arrogant boy, had no choice but to be polite in front of the visitor. After all, he was the father of the lady he fancied and the hero of this empire, Duke Floyen.\u201cW-what\u2019s your purpose for visiting us this late at night, Your Grace?\u201dRegis coldly glared at the young man in front of him.\u201cI\u2019m not going to marry someone unless he has everything. I want the most wealthy, famous, and competent man there is.\u201dAs he observed the young man, the duke pondered over what his daughter had said. \u201cYou fall short of the standards, Edmund Anshan Rowen,\u201d he finally said.* * *The next morning, I woke up in a groggy state.\u00a0\u2018Ugh, my back hurts.\u2019\u00a0Although I had solved yesterday\u2019s problem and avoided talking about the marriage list, something felt a little off. I tried thinking about the cause of this unpleasantness, but I could only focus on my empty stomach.\u00a0\u2018It must be because I didn\u2019t eat breakfast.\u2019I pulled the line to summon an attendant, and Merilyn soon entered my room. \u201cGood morning, Lady Floyen.\u201d\u201cCould you help me get ready for breakfast?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI washed my face, changed into casual clothes, and braided my hair. After doing so I felt more refreshed and looked more suitable to go downstairs for breakfast. Even so, the unpleasant feeling did not go away.\u00a0\u2018What\u2019s wrong with me? There must be something\u2026\u2019At that moment, Merilyn said, \u201cA package arrived from Fyodor\u2019s workshop, my lady.\u201dI nodded.\u00a0\u2018So that\u2019s why I felt uncomfortable.\u2019\u00a0Rose\u2019s birthday was coming up, but her gift just arrived. \u201cCould you bring it to my room?\u201d I asked her.\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Merilyn left my room to get the gift. I waited for her to return with high expectations.\u2018I wonder how it turned out. I hope he did what I instructed him to do\u2026\u2019\u00a0Not long after, Merilyn entered with a box in her hands.\u201cHere it is.\u201dWhen I opened the box, I found an object that perfectly replicated my spoken order, as well as another item that had a different color next to it.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m satisfied with my order\u2026 but why is there another object? Is this like a one plus one thing?\u2019\u00a0I looked at the object with bewilderment, then found a note inside the box.For you, my muse.Although it was merely a note, the word \u2018muse\u2019 made me feel uncomfortable. I pondered over the meaning of the note, then speculated that it was simply an exaggerated phrase used by most artists.\u00a0\u2018Well, a good thing is a good thing.\u2019\u00a0As I looked at the objects with satisfaction, the maids started asking questions.\u201cWhat is this, my lady?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you its purpose soon,\u201d I said to the maids, who were looking at the objects with curiosity. Then I placed the gifts in my drawer.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I have something more important to do now.\u2019At that moment, I heard someone speak from outside my room. \u201cBreakfast is ready, my lady.\u201dI quickly left my room with a cheerful expression.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll have breakfast first.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Transparent debris lay haphazardly on the floor. People briefly looked at the glass shards, seeming to think that it was an accident. As they were about to resume their conversations, a man\u2019s low voice broke the silence.\u201cDoes babbling about groundless rumors make you pleased?\u201dThe salon was a place of socialization for nobles; a place for honorable guests to gather. Although everyone\u2019s faces were covered with masks, there was an unwritten rule to respect each other. In response to the man\u2019s harsh language, the women who had been chatting sharpened their gazes.\u201cHow dare you say something so rude?\u201d someone shot back. \u201cPeople have even witnessed the man she was with!\u201d She fanned herself, but her anger quickly fizzled out when she sensed the man\u2019s dangerous aura. She became overwhelmed by a strange force and silently gasped for air.The man gave her a crooked smile. \u201cBut did you see it for yourself?\u201d\u201cE-even if I didn\u2019t see it, she committed many misdeeds. That\u2019s probably how the rumors started.\u201d\u201cMisdeeds, you say?\u201d The man chuckled, then lowered the corner of his lips. \u201cTry saying that in front of Lady Floyen,\u201d he muttered coldly. He observed the silent masses around him, but everyone avoided his gaze. The mocking smile on his face disappeared. \u201cI see you don\u2019t even dare to speak to the person involved.\u201d There was still no response. \u201cClean this mess up,\u201d the man ordered the attendants with a cold voice. They obeyed his order without hesitation. The nobles soon recovered their senses and began to criticize the man.\u201cWho on earth is he? Why is he so rude?\u201d\u201cHe has no respect for the ladies. How disrespectful\u2026\u201dThe man stared at the nobles who dared to speak against him. They became overwhelmed by a strange, eerie feeling and shut their mouths right away. The man laughed. \u201cPathetic trash,\u201d he spat out. Although it was a more explicit insult compared to before, no one dared to stand up against him this time. They could sense that if they continued to offend the callous man, they might pay for it with their lives. When the man turned around and left, the nobles watched with bated breaths, only exhaling when he became completely out of sight.* * *After eating breakfast, I went back to my room and began to write replies to the letters I had received.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll let the two men know I already found a partner. I should reply to my other letters as well.\u2019At that moment, someone knocked on my door. \u201cThis is Derrick, my lady.\u201d His visits were always to be taken seriously. Derrick only sought me if there was an important matter during Father\u2019s absence, or if there was a guest for me.I turned towards Merilyn. \u201cPlease open the door.\u201d When she did, Derrick came into view and bowed with a slightly tense expression.\u201cDid something happen, Derrick?\u201d\u201cEdmund, the youngest son of Count Rowen, is here in response to your letter, my lady.\u201d\u2018Oh, he came here directly instead of writing another reply.\u2019\u00a0I was a bit taken aback, but since he was going to be my partner for the banquet, there was no harm in getting to know each other in advance. \u201cI\u2019ll prepare to go down. Can you please tell him to wait a moment?\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201dWhen Derrick left, I turned towards my maids. \u201cAlright, then\u2026\u201d I barely got out a few words, but they were already busy preparing my outfit.\u201cCome this way, my lady. We will dress you as quickly and beautifully as possible.\u201dI sighed upon seeing Sella and Merilyn\u2019s determined expressions.\u00a0\u2018I just wanted to change my clothes\u2026 I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - RumorsThe woman parted her red lips and swept her long, red hair to the side. \u201cOh my, it\u2019s been a long time!\u201d The voice belonged to Fresia, the owner of Blooms Salon. She greeted the man with smiling eyes, but the man responded bluntly.\u201cI see that you\u2019ve been letting filthy nobles pollute this place.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. They like to talk about other people.\u201dThe man smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty honest thing to say for an information guild master.\u201d\u201cObviously the guild will go under if I don\u2019t keep a sense of reality,\u201d the woman lightly joked. When the man poured himself a glass of liquor and drank willfully, she frowned. The drink he had casually poured was as expensive as an entire estate.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s a heavy drinker too\u2026\u2019\u00a0Although it was very wasteful for him to chug down the expensive beverage, she was powerless against her financier. Instead of scolding the man, Fresia directed her attention towards something else that she had been meaning to talk about.\u201cYou usually hide your feelings well and never treat other nobles as human beings. Why are you so angry today?\u201dThe man coldly dismissed Fresia\u2019s observations. \u201cI simply told some barking dogs to be quiet because they were annoying me. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u2018He\u2019s become strange since visiting Duke Floyen\u2019s mansion.\u2019\u00a0The woman sighed. Although she didn\u2019t want to criticize him any further, she was determined to protect her master \u2014 that meant preventing him from behaving as he pleased. \u201cI hope you will be more careful about your behavior from now on,\u201d she said.The man sat on the couch and took off his mask, revealing a youthful face. \u201cDig deeper into the rumor about Lady Floyen.\u201dThe woman frowned. \u201cDo you mean the rumor about Lady Floyen\u2019s secret meetings with a lover she cannot reveal?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d There was a chance that he might become responsible for her in the future. When he thought about that possibility, the man felt an odd sensation in his heart. \u201cI want to know every little detail about her,\u201d he said without showing any sign of affection.\u2018Why is he looking after her\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s trying to find the duke\u2019s weakness?\u2019\u00a0Fresia stared at the young man with a puzzled gaze for a while, then lowered her head. \u201cI will serve you to the best of my abilities, Your Highness Maximillian.\u201d* * *After getting dressed without seeming like I tried too hard, I stepped into the drawing room. The young man waiting for me possessed blond hair and a handsome appearance. His bored expression lit up as soon as he saw me.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Lady Floyen,\u201d he greeted me.\u201cWelcome, Lord Rowen.\u201dThe man stepped forward and bowed politely. \u201cI apologize for seeing you so abruptly without prior notice.\u201d\u201cNo, guests are always welcome. Please have a seat.\u201dHe smiled as he looked at me. \u201cThank you for your hospitality.\u201d The young man had blue eyes and blond hair that shined like threads of gold. He was even more charming when he smiled. Although he couldn\u2019t be compared to Mikhail, he was nonetheless a handsome man who lived up to his reputation.\u2018There are many handsome side characters in this novel,\u2019\u00a0I observed. I suddenly thought about my father\u2019s disciple.\u00a0\u2018Although his personality sucks, he\u2019s probably the most handsome person I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019\u00a0There were times I would blankly stare at him sleeping under my bed in the morning, wondering if this was a dream.\u2018I hope he\u2019s not starving for food out there. He should be doing well, right?\u2019\u00a0I sighed upon realizing that my father\u2019s disciple was the cause of the unpleasantness I had felt since this morning. I indulged in such thoughts for a while until a low voice called me.\u201cMy lady.\u201d\u2018Oh, right.\u2019\u00a0I became reminded of the current situation and I directed my attention back to the esteemed son of Count Rowen, a fair and handsome man.\u201cPlease bring us some refreshments, Merilyn.\u201d When she left to do so, we became alone in the drawing room.\u201cI must tell you why I visited, my lady.\u201d His reason was obvious. He probably came to thank me for becoming his partner and wanted to get acquainted with me before the banquet next week.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.\u201cI was actually very surprised to receive a letter from you. You\u2019re rather different from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\u2018What does he mean by \u2018heard\u2019? Who did he hear from?\u2019\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked with bewilderment.He looked at me with an embarrassed expression. \u201cDo you know what kind of rumors are being said in high society these days?\u201d\u2018Rumors? I stayed at home all day, so there\u2019s no way I would know any.\u2019\u201cI haven\u2019t been to any social gatherings lately. What are the rumors about?\u201dHe hardened his expression and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s said that you are deeply in love with another man. That\u2019s why I was surprised when I got a reply from you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m deeply in love? What kind of nonsense is this?\u2019\u00a0All this time, I had been reading books at home and wandering around the mansion. Even when I went out, an entourage of knights would escort me. Since I spent most days living in seclusion, I couldn\u2019t possibly find the chance to be in a relationship. I was confused by this ridiculous rumor when a thought suddenly occurred to me.\u2018No way. Did someone see my father\u2019s disciple enter or leave my room through the window?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Ruined PlansAlthough I was taken aback by this unexpected predicament, I didn\u2019t reveal my uneasiness in fear that the rumors might be established as a fact. I calmed myself down and glared at the young man.\u201cWho said I was deeply in love?\u201d I asked, acting as if he had just said something ridiculous.He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know the details either. This rumor has been spreading around lately\u2026 I just happened to overhear it.\u201dI frowned. If everyone knew that I was the subject of this rumor but no one knew my supposed lover\u2019s identity, it must\u2019ve been created out of malice.\u00a0\u2018If someone indeed saw my father\u2019s disciple, the person who started this rumor probably guessed his identity to add details. They might have mentioned his handsome appearance as well.\u2019After grasping the situation, I deliberately raised my voice to show my bewilderment. \u201cI stay at home most of the time, so that\u2019s not possible! If necessary, I can gather witnesses who recently visited the estate.\u201dIn response to my stubborn denial, he let out a sigh of relief. \u201cSo the rumors weren\u2019t true after all.\u201dI smiled. \u201cYes, so you can rest assured.\u201d\u201cMy lady.\u201d He suddenly kneeled before me.\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Lord Rowen?\u201d I asked with surprise.He continued to stare at me with a serious expression without standing up.\u00a0\u2018Is there something else that he needs to tell me?\u2019\u00a0As I looked at him anxiously, he lowered his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered regretfully.I frowned at his sudden apology. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry? What do you mean\u2026?\u201dHe stared at me intensely. \u201cI made a big mistake.\u201d\u201cA mistake? What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cI thought you were going to refuse my request, so I have already partnered with another lady.\u201dHis unexpected declaration hit me like a ton of bricks.\u00a0\u2018You mean you acted rashly before even receiving my reply?\u2019\u00a0It was proper etiquette to always respond to requests, as well as wait for a response before asking another prospective partner. I was lucky that I hadn\u2019t sent a response to the two other men yet, otherwise, I would\u2019ve had to attend the banquet by myself.\u00a0\u2018And if I did that, my father would mention the marriage list to me.\u2019The man in front of me twisted his expression as if he was truly troubled. \u201cI have always dreamed of this day. Unfortunately, I lack\u2026 no, it\u2019s because of my carelessness.\u201dHe was acting with such distress that it seemed like he was truly sorry. I felt relieved that he came. Thanks to him, I had the chance to learn about the ill-intended rumor.\u00a0\u2018If I ignore what he had just told me about, it might cause a mess in the future\u2026 Although it\u2019s bothersome, I will have to dig deeper into it.\u2019I forced out a laugh to show that I wasn\u2019t offended. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can just find another partner. Why don\u2019t you get up?\u201d\u201cAre you an angel?\u201d he muttered under his breath.\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, wondering if I had heard him wrong.\u201cOh, no. I meant that\u2026 you have the heart of an angel,\u201d he quickly amended.\u2018Hm\u2026 I\u2019m obviously a villainess, but he compared me to an angel.\u2019\u00a0Other people would laugh at this comparison, but I forgave him, knowing that he was exaggerating.\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t make up for one of the biggest mistakes in my life, I truly regret it.\u201d It was obvious why he was apologizing excessively to me; he didn\u2019t want me to tell my father about this incident.\u2018I never intended on telling him even if he doesn\u2019t do that\u2026\u2019\u00a0I looked back at his gaze which was making me uncomfortable and tried to console him. But he spoke again in a sorrowful voice before I could do so.\u201cMost of all, I\u2019m afraid that my careless actions may have hurt your feelings.\u201dI was growing tired of his excessive apologies, despite my repeated attempts to tell him that it was okay. \u201cDon\u2019t be, Lord Rowen. I must thank you for bringing this rumor to my attention and for taking the time to visit.\u201d\u201cThank you for forgiving me, Lady Floyen,\u201d he said with a bitter smile. When it looked like he was about to leave, he suddenly leaned into me and whispered, \u201cI was upset because I thought I wasn\u2019t qualified\u2026 but I\u2019m comforted by your words, my lady.\u201d\u2018Huh? Not qualified?\u2019\u00a0I was about to ask him what he meant by that, but he continued to speak.\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t we\u2026\u201d The man trailed off and abruptly shut his mouth. He stared at the window behind me with a pale expression.\u2018Why is he acting like that? It seems like he saw something scary.\u2019\u00a0I turned around to see what caused him to look so pale, but there was nothing unusual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was actually a blessing in disguise that he left early since I preferred drinking tea alone.\u201cMerilyn, please set\u2026\u201d Before I could tell her to only arrange the table for me, someone else stepped into the drawing room. \u201cOh, Father\u2026 Hello.\u201d I managed to greet him as naturally as I could. He merely nodded instead of answering.\u2018I hope he didn\u2019t overhear my conversation with Lord Rowen, otherwise, he might talk about the marriage list.\u2019\u00a0His sudden appearance made me anxious, and that feeling only grew when he slowly approached me.\u201cAre you drinking tea?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes.\u201dHe sat in the chair across from me as if it was the natural thing to do. \u201cGood. I\u2019m thirsty as well.\u201dI looked at the steaming teapot, then at him with quivering eyes.\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re going to drink hot tea when you\u2019re thirsty?\u2019\u00a0Nevertheless, I didn\u2019t comment on the strangeness of this.\u201cThe tea is hot, so you should probably drink it when it cools down\u2026 or you could just drink some water.\u201d\u201cI can talk to you until the tea cools down,\u201d my father said.\u2018It\u2019s more reasonable to leave and drink water. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s waiting here to have tea with me.\u2019\u00a0As I pondered over this, two cups of tea were placed on the table.\u00a0\u2018I guess I won\u2019t be drinking tea alone.\u2019\u00a0My father lifted the teacup gracefully and gazed at me with a warlike aura.I smiled brightly and picked up a cookie.\u00a0\u2018Now I have to drink in this tense atmosphere.\u2019* * *\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d a low voice asked.Madam Fresia smiled brightly and said, \u201cLady Floyen accepted Lord Rowen\u2019s offer to become her partner.\u201dMax felt a surge of annoyance at the word \u2018partner.\u2019 \u201cI see,\u201d he said, trying to look calm.\u201cOn the surface, he is a handsome and well-mannered young man, but it\u2019s rumored that he\u2019s a womanizer who has reduced many young ladies to tears,\u201d Fresia added playfully.Max twisted his expression.\u00a0\u2018That woman. I told her not to only look at appearances\u2026\u2019\u00a0For some reason, anger flared up inside him. \u201cSo, are those two are going to the ball together?\u201d he asked sharply.Fresia clicked her tongue and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is a good or bad thing, but he turned the lady down.\u201dMax raised his voice. \u201cHow dare a count\u2019s son reject someone like her!\u201dFresia clicked her tongue again and sighed. Judging by his reaction alone, it was impossible to figure out what kind of news Max wanted to hear.\u00a0\u2018If he\u2019s concerned about the lady, he should just offer to become her partner\u2026\u2019At that moment, Max spoke. \u201cDid you find out who started the rumors about her?\u201dFresia\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cWho did it?\u201d Max asked with a bloodthirsty growl.Fresia smiled. \u201cIt turned out to be Viscount Droil.\u201d When Max\u2019s expression hardened, she added, \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny? She used to be his lover, but he does nothing while his troubled cousin slanders her.\u201dMax was deep in thought for a while, then he said, \u201cFind out every weakness of Marquis Hessen and Viscount Droil.

I tried to come up with an explanation for his behavior, but I didn\u2019t dwell on it for long, thinking that it would be more beneficial to solve my own problems first.\u201cAh, yes. Have a nice trip,\u201d I said, preparing to stand up.\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to solve,\u201d my father said.\u2018Oh, I see.

I\u2019m sorry.\u2019As I was sympathizing with them, my father looked at me and said, \u201cI will be back before dinner.\u201dI didn\u2019t care when he would come back, whether it was tomorrow or the next few days. Even so, I didn\u2019t voice such thoughts in fear that I might incur his wrath and be forced to meet the men on the marriage list.\u201cI will wait for you,\u201d I said insincerely.\u201cAlright.\u201d My father stared at me for a while, then nodded. His sudden change of attitude was strange, but I could guess his intentions and wanted to laugh.\u2018By telling me that he plans to warn some people\u2026 is he trying to make an example of them?\u2019\u00a0My heart ached at this thought, but I managed to overcome the discomfort and left the drawing room.

    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - A Surprise VisitThe only people who knew about them were the escort knights, the shopkeepers, and Radian, who I had briefly encountered in the store. The former was out of the equation. Not only were the escort knights our vassals, but they also knew that I was usually alone at home. The shopkeepers couldn\u2019t be so bold as to start such rumors either, in fear of decapitation. Even if these weren\u2019t valid reasons, the answer was obvious from the beginning.\u2018Radian. How can he be so delusional to start rumors just because I bought a pair of cufflinks?\u2019\u00a0His notoriety as a viper was fitting, seeing as how he bit off more than he could chew.\u00a0\u2018Now that I think about it, Lord Rowen made a lot of excuses. He must\u2019ve found another partner after hearing this rumor\u2026 The same thing will probably happen if I accept Sir Boromir\u2019s or Lord Crocus\u2019s offers to become my partner.\u2019My only option was to find a partner who wouldn\u2019t be deterred by this rumor, otherwise, my father might mention the marriage list.\u00a0\u2018The problem is\u2026 is there such a person?\u2019As I became lost in thought, a knocking sound on my window broke my concentration.\u00a0\u2018What is it?\u2019\u00a0I turned around to look at the source.A familiar, handsome face came into view. He looked at me and pointed at the latch.\u00a0\u2018Ah, my father\u2019s disciple is here again.\u2019\u00a0I didn\u2019t think that he was being sincere in the note he had written with his eccentric handwriting.\u2018Coming and going as he pleases\u2026 how bothersome.\u2019\u00a0I sighed and released the latch. He opened the window and entered my room.\u2018He\u2019s still handsome\u2026 No, I can\u2019t think about that right now.\u2019\u00a0I was reminded of what was troubling me and snapped out of my foolish thoughts. If someone witnessed him coming into my room, the rumor might become an established fact.\u00a0\u2018Well\u2026 that\u2019s not the only reason. Nothing good will come from being closer to him either.\u2019\u00a0For these reasons, I decided to ask him not to visit for the time being.\u201cHey, you know you can\u2019t\u2014\u201dHe cut me off. \u201cWhere were you just now?\u201d he asked with a piercing gaze.\u2018He\u2019s being ridiculous.\u2019\u00a0I frowned slightly. His question was absurd, considering that we hadn\u2019t met in a while.\u201cI said, where were you just now?\u201d he repeated.Although I wanted to ask him the same thing, such as where he went and why he came back so suddenly, I didn\u2019t want to argue with an immature person like him. I already had a lot on my mind.\u201cDownstairs,\u201d I said.He loosened his tense expression. \u201cI see.\u201d He even smiled slightly, much to my bewilderment. His emotions were difficult to follow.\u2018I don\u2019t have time to deal with him today\u2026 I have many other things to think about.\u2019\u00a0I glanced at him and decided to make him my father\u2019s responsibility. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to see my father, I think he\u2019s still home\u2014\u201dHe cut me off again. \u201cNo, he just left.\u201d\u2018If he doesn\u2019t want to see my father, why did he come here? Was he kicked out again?\u2019\u00a0My thoughts became more complicated as I tried to think about possible scenarios on top of my existing problems.\u201cWhy are you sighing?\u201d he asked with a frown. Although we became closer after spending a few days together, I wasn\u2019t comfortable enough to tell him my troubles.\u201cI\u2019m just worried about a lot of things,\u201d I said vaguely.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal\u2026\u201d I trailed off, hoping to end the conversation there.\u201cTell me. I won\u2019t tell anyone else,\u201d he said.When I gazed into his red eyes, I recalled the time I had told him about my troubles with my father.\u00a0\u2018Will I feel better like I did back then?\u2019\u201cThen please promise me that you won\u2019t tell my father,\u201d I said. I stared at him and waited for a response.He nodded gently. \u201cOkay, I promise.\u201d\u201c100 gold bars if you break the promise?\u201d I joked, amused that he was strangely being obedient.He twisted his expression. \u201cStop joking around and just tell me. I will never break my promise.\u201dI was still worried, but I remembered the days we spent together. His firm voice and gaze also made me trust him a little more.\u00a0\u2018Even if he tells someone, the worst that can happen is getting scolded.\u2019When I made up my mind to tell him, he must\u2019ve thought I was still hesitating because he said, \u201cIf I say anything, even by accident, I will give you all my wealth. So, go ahead and tell me.\u201dI burst out laughing because he had said those words quite seriously.\u00a0\u2018He doesn\u2019t even have a home, but he\u2019s betting all his money?\u2019\u00a0I quickly forgot about how upset I was.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d His face became a little red as if he was displeased by my amusement. I barely suppressed my laughter, thinking that he would get angry if I continued.\u201cThen that\u2019s a deal. If I find out that my father knows, I\u2019ll make sure to take everything you have.\u201dHe scowled. \u201cYes, so hurry up and tell me,\u201d he said sharply, unlike his previous tone. Although I didn\u2019t like his attitude, I kind of felt like I could trust him.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d I began slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - A Suitable PartnerMax\u2019s foul mood improved when he saw her. He even became relieved when he found out that she had been downstairs. Now that Jubelian was smiling, Max felt his face burning.\u00a0\u2018Did I\u2026 catch a cold?\u2019\u00a0Although he had never gotten sick after mastering swordsmanship, he had been busy roaming around and investigating the rumors about her.\u00a0\u2018If she sees me like this, she\u2019ll think I\u2019m weak.\u2019To prevent her from noticing his flushed appearance, Max quickly looked away and said, \u201cYes, so hurry up and tell me.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cThere have been malicious rumors about me.\u201dMax clenched his fists.\u00a0\u2018I guess it was only a matter of time before she found out.\u2019\u00a0He carefully observed Jubelian for any changes in her expression, worried that she might have been distressed by the rumors.\u201cI\u2019m actually not worried about that,\u201d she said. Any noblewoman would\u2019ve been ashamed by such disgraceful rumors, but she didn\u2019t seem to be.\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d he asked.\u201cI have a clear conscience. Besides, a relationship like that is nothing to be ashamed of. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\u201cJust?\u201dJubelian smiled bitterly. \u201cIt seems like all the people who offered to become my partner will back out because of that.\u201dMax clenched his fists unconsciously.\u00a0\u2018Why on earth are those stupid people being swayed by such rumors? I would never do such\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max became surprised by his own thoughts for a moment.\u00a0\u2018What am I thinking\u2026\u2019\u00a0A sense of shame washed over him until Jubelian\u2019s pleasant voice snapped him to attention.\u201cOf course, I wasn\u2019t upset about that. It doesn\u2019t matter whether I have a partner or not.\u201dMax sighed, feeling somewhat discouraged. \u201cWhat are you so upset about then?\u201d he asked sharply.The woman\u2019s eyes suddenly dropped.\u00a0\u2018Did I sound too harsh?\u2019\u00a0He had never asked himself this question before, but he found himself reflecting upon his tone. His regret was fleeting, however, because the woman began speaking again.\u201cThe problem is\u2026 my father made a list of prospective marriage partners. I ended up finding out about it.\u201d\u2018Prospective marriage partners.\u2019\u00a0Max froze when he heard those unexpected words. \u201cA list of prospective marriage partners?\u201d he asked to confirm.\u201cYes, I saw a marked-up list of noblemen from wealthy families. He didn\u2019t even ask for my opinion, so it\u2019s likely that he\u2019ll force me to meet them.\u201dMax clenched his fists at the thought of his master.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s trying to marry his daughter off\u2026\u2019\u00a0If he had heard about this in the past, he would\u2019ve praised his actions, thinking that his master had finally come to his senses. But for some reason, Max felt angry.\u00a0\u2018Is this the type of person you really are? Were you only pretending to care about your daughter in front of me?\u2019\u00a0Max wore a menacing expression, inexplicably furious.\u201cThat\u2019s why I have to find a partner,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go on a blind date with the men on the list.\u201dMax unconsciously stared at her, unable to grow tired of her eyes no matter how many times he saw them. They looked like a field of periwinkle flowers scattered across a clear lake. He parted his lips, powerless against a strange impulse that constantly jabbed his heart.\u201cThere could be a suitable partner nearby,\u201d he said.\u201cNearby?\u201dWhen she stared at him with quivering eyes, Max felt his heart tingle.\u00a0\u2018She has a good eye\u2026 seeing as how she turned to me right away.\u2019\u00a0Max felt like he was going to burst into laughter if he let his guard down, but he hurriedly turned away the moment he realized this.\u00a0\u2018What am I thinking\u2026!\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said.\u201cWhat?\u201d Max stared at the woman, surprised that she had agreed so easily. She suddenly grabbed his hand with a bright smile. If he wanted to, he could easily shake off her soft, dainty hands, but he simply stared at her without moving.\u201cWhat was I thinking? There was a suitable partner all this time,\u201d she said.Max became alert and felt his mouth go dry. She was still holding his hand, which became increasingly warm.\u00a0\u2018Why am I nervous?\u2019\u00a0He frowned at his body\u2019s unusual reactions.\u00a0\u2018Because of a weak woman like her\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max glared at Jubelian, but the moment he met her eyes, he became embarrassed and hurriedly pulled away from her.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re realizing this just now,\u201d he said bluntly.A bright smile appeared on Jubelian\u2019s beautiful face. \u201cI know, right? If it weren\u2019t for you, I would\u2019ve been worried for the rest of the day.\u201dHis heart tingled with increasing intensity.\u00a0\u2018A partner\u2026 Although it will be bothersome, I guess I can do that for her.\u2019\u00a0Max made up his mind to attend the banquet with her.\u201cA man who my father trusts and approves of\u2026 I will ask Geraldine,\u201d she said.Although the woman didn\u2019t mention Mikhail or any of the men who had asked to be her partner, Max felt his mood plunge at the mention of a man that his master approved of. \u201cWho is that?\u201d he asked with irritation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - A Suitable Partner\u201cAh, he\u2019s one of my escort knights. He\u2019s also my maternal cousin, so I won\u2019t have to worry about any rumors because of him. There\u2019s no one else better suited for this job,\u201d Jubelian said with a bright expression. She seemed so content that this problem was solved that she was unaware of Max\u2019s foul mood.Max\u2019s displeasure gradually subsided.\u00a0\u2018If he\u2019s a relative, I guess it\u2019s alright.\u2019\u00a0When he realized that he was relieved, Max twisted his expression.\u00a0\u2018What does this have to do with me anyway? I just need to learn more about my master\u2019s weakness\u2026\u2019\u00a0As Max recalled his original purpose, the woman\u2019s defenseless smile came into view.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. Her smile was so radiant that the dull ache in Max\u2019s heart was followed by intense pounding. When he became aware of this, he became afraid.\u201cI will be going now,\u201d he said abruptly. If he stayed any longer, Max wasn\u2019t sure if he could control himself. When he tried to leave, almost as if he was running away from something, Jubelian called out to him.\u201cHey, wait a second!\u201dInstead of responding, Max glared at her fiercely, warning her to not come closer. Strangely, his heart throbbed when she seemed to understand this. Jubelian stared at him calmly and wore the same expression as she did when she saw him through the window today.She proceeded to place some pouches on the floor before stepping back. \u201cTake these,\u201d she said.\u2018What\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max checked what was inside and frowned.\u00a0\u2018Money? Why is she giving me this?\u2019\u00a0He was about to throw the pouches back on the floor and tell her he didn\u2019t need them, but he suddenly met her kind eyes. Her gaze reminded him of the times she had covered him with a blanket and given him food to eat. Max slowly lowered his arm.\u201cIt\u2019s not for free. As repayment, you can help me out if I ever need it,\u201d she said.\u201c\u2026\u201dMax had planned to never come back again, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say that. He slipped the money into his pockets and prepared to leave the room.\u201cIf you have no place to go, you can always come back,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay?\u201dMax impulsively nodded upon seeing her warm smile, as if there was an irresistible force controlling him.* * *\u2018Lord Boromir decided to give up after one word from me\u2026\u2019\u00a0Despite the easy obedience from the previous two men he had visited, it was a mistake to think that the last person would be the same.\u2018So this is the foreign minister\u2019s son?\u2019\u00a0Regis coldly stared at the young man drinking tea in front of him, but he seemed to be relaxed.\u201cSo, you\u2019re warning me to stay away from your daughter because I don\u2019t meet her standards, Your Excellency?\u201d Although the young man\u2019s smiling face was quite handsome, he was still lacking compared to Jubelian\u2019s appearance.\u201cYes,\u201d Regis said. Despite his straightforward answer, the young man managed to remain calm.\u201cWell, it\u2019s true she\u2019s better than all the other ladies.\u201dAlthough Regis agreed with him, it didn\u2019t mean he approved of the young man. \u201cI clearly told you not to approach my daughter, Ronald Herman Crocus.\u201d After giving this final warning, he stood up.\u2018Now that I think about it, he was also on the marriage list.\u2019\u00a0The duke was determined to revise the very thing that had been bothering him recently and prepared to return home to do so.\u201cYou should change your mind soon. Your daughter will come to love me.\u201dIn response to his boastful words, Regis turned around and stared at the young man. His eyes lowered when he imagined Mikhail\u2019s fine characteristics on the young man\u2019s face.\u201cDo you really think my daughter will like a lowly thing like you?\u201dThe young man tried to maintain his composure, but he suddenly had trouble breathing through the oppressive aura of the unrestrained, transcendent being.\u00a0\u2018Is this Duke Floyen\u2019s\u2026!\u2019\u00a0It seemed like the young man had pushed the duke too far. By showing interest in his daughter, he had wanted to bring the empire\u2019s hero to his side for his family\u2019s benefit. Although he tried making their meeting memorable, it had backfired.\u201cI have met a lot of people like you\u2026 opportunists who treat people like tools to get what they want,\u201d the duke said.From a young age, the young man had been taught by his father, the minister of foreign affairs, to never back down. He had learned to never be the first one to break a stare, to relax in any tense situation, and to always be confident and fearless. But despite years of practice, the young man was frightened by Duke Floyen\u2019s chilling glare.\u201cDoes my daughter seem easy to you?\u201d he asked.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dWhen he managed to apologize, the duke\u2019s intangible energy loosened its hold on the young man. He stared at him coldly.\u201cOne mistake is enough,\u201d Regis muttered underneath his breath. Then he left the drawing room, his blue eyes filled with bitterness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Not The PlanAfter he had left without another word last time, I had been feeling quite restless for not giving him travel expenses. It was like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders when he took the money.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t have to worry about him being hungry for the time being,\u2019\u00a0I thought with relief.I disliked it when other people didn\u2019t eat properly, so I was discomfited by the thought of him starving outside. Perhaps it was because I was often hungry in my past life, due to my impoverished circumstances. Or perhaps it was because I felt attached to this man, who had stayed in my room for a few days.\u2018Well, I gave him a way to repay me so he won\u2019t feel bad. It should be okay.\u2019\u00a0Although I had told him to help me if I needed it, this was an empty request. As a noblewoman, there was no need for me to ask a commoner for help. I only said that because I didn\u2019t want him to think I was patronizing him.\u2018Now, I have to solve the root of my problem.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0Before I asked Geraldine to be my partner for the banquet, I needed to find a way to undo Radian\u2019s damage.\u00a0\u2018How can I screw him over?\u2019\u00a0I thought. The cufflinks I bought for my father were made of blue diamonds, a rare and precious gemstone, that were fashioned with a unique design, as nobles tended to avoid things that had the same design. It made sense that the rumors got out of control because I still held onto these expensive jewels.\u2018I need to find evidence to defend myself\u2026\u2019\u00a0But despite my determination, I couldn\u2019t think of anything and began to feel helpless. As a dull ache began to spread in my head, a thought suddenly occurred to me.\u00a0\u2018Oh, yes. I should do that!\u2019\u00a0It wouldn\u2019t hurt to try this idea, even if it didn\u2019t work.I called Merilyn over. \u201cWhen my father comes back, tell him that I want to see him. I have something to give to him,\u201d I said.* * *The sun had yet to set when Regis returned, thanks to his efficiency in dealing with matters. Dinner was usually after seven, so he still had some time to spare.\u00a0\u2018Fortunately, I\u2019m not late.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0He was relieved to be able to catch dinner with his daughter.Regis handed his coat to Derrick and ordered, \u201cThe men on the prospective marriage list are substandard. Redo it.\u201dDerrick sighed.\u00a0\u2018I chose from noble families ranked higher than marquis. If I have to leave more men out of the list, there won\u2019t be many left\u2026\u2019Although he was displeased, Derrick replied with a businesslike tone. \u201cYes, master. I will do my best.\u201d\u201cIf you can, please find candidates with nice personalities as well.\u201dIn the aristocracy, finding someone with a good character was like finding a needle in a haystack. Although he felt helpless, Derrick nodded without betraying a hint of dissatisfaction. \u201cI will do as directed,\u201d he said.\u201cLet me know when it\u2019s dinnertime.\u201dDerrick turned around, then stopped as if he just remembered something. \u201cOh, the lady says that she has something to give to you, master.\u201d\u201cGive?\u201d The duke turned towards him and widened his eyes with disbelief. \u201cAlright. Tell her that we can have tea before dinner.\u201d\u201cI will inform the lady.\u201d When Derrick left, Regis glanced at the clock. It was now 4:30 pm. The usual time for tea was around 5:00 pm, so there were still 30 minutes until then.\u2018I still have to wait for a while.\u2019\u00a0He sighed softly, then stared at the paper on his desk. There were many names written below the heading, \u2018Prospective Marriage Partners.\u2019 Among them were foreign royals, high-ranking aristocrats, and distinguished men from high society. Except for a few names, most of them were crossed out. Regis fixated his gaze on an unmarked name, \u2018Ronald Herman Crocus.\u2019 He picked up his pen and scratched out his name before studying the list with a sigh.\u2018There is no one here who meets all of my daughter\u2019s conditions.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m not going to marry someone unless he has everything. I want the most wealthy, famous, and competent man there is,\u201d\u00a0she had said. Regis mulled over her words for a while, then spotted a circled name on the list. It was his only disciple and the imperial family\u2019s only successor to the throne, Maximillian.\u2018Now that I think about it, he\u2019s the only guy who meets all of her requirements.\u2019\u00a0He had originally intended to cross him out but had accidentally made it look like a mark of approval. Regis softly chuckled at this blunder for a while, then furrowed his eyebrows.\u00a0\u2018My daughter is more than what this crafty guy deserves.\u2019As he prepared to cross out his name, Derrick\u2019s voice came from outside the door. \u201cIt\u2019s time for tea with the lady, master.\u201d\u2018Ah, it\u2019s already time.\u2019\u00a0Regis ended up leaving his office without crossing out the name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Not The PlanWhen I arrived in the living room, my father was already sitting down.\u201cTake a seat,\u201d he said.\u201cYes, Father.\u201d I sat down in front of him and deliberately tried to seem friendly. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be drinking tea with you.\u201dAlthough I felt the opposite of affectionate inside, I was flattering him for a reason.\u00a0\u2018I have to make him wear the cufflinks.\u2019\u00a0Radian\u2019s rumors gained credibility because the whereabouts of these cufflinks were unknown, so this misunderstanding could only be cleared up if my father wore them in public.There was something else that was bothering me, however. \u201cYou\u2019re at home more often these days, Father,\u201d I said.He nodded. \u201cBecause I promised,\u201d he said vaguely. Although I didn\u2019t know what he had promised or who he had promised to, his frequent presence at home would only make my life more difficult.\u2018If he keeps acting like this, my plan will\u2026 Anyway, I have to persuade him to wear these first.\u2019\u00a0If I could get my father to wear the cufflinks and visit a crowded place like the imperial palace, the rumors would end.\u201cI heard that there was an assassination attempt at the imperial palace. Is everyone okay?\u201d I asked.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to concern yourself with those matters,\u201d my father said coldly. I usually would have been offended by his tone and stopped talking, but I had an important goal to accomplish today.\u201cI\u2019m just worried that if you stay at home for too long, the imperial palace won\u2019t be as safe. You are the strongest swordsman in the empire after all. I understand if you are desperately needed there, Father.\u201dAs I was busy flattering him, he suddenly said, \u201cI plan to retire within this year.\u201d\u2018What? Retire?\u2019\u00a0I was taken aback because he was still relatively young to even think about that.\u00a0\u2018If that\u2019s the case, my plan won\u2019t work\u2026\u2019\u00a0If he planned on living in seclusion after retiring, I could only convince him to go to social gatherings\u2026\u00a0\u2018But I have never seen my father attend parties. In the novel, the duke didn\u2019t even attend his daughter\u2019s debutante.\u2019\u00a0My idea was close to impossible.\u201cBut\u2014\u201dAlthough I wanted to persuade him otherwise, he cut me off. \u201cI have been thinking about it for a long time, so don\u2019t try to convince me.\u201d He seemed to be warning me to not interfere with his personal matters, so I backed down, worried that he wouldn\u2019t bother wearing the cufflinks if I offended him any further.\u201cAlright. It\u2019s good that you\u2019ll be at home more often, but staying inside all the time can get boring. You should think about attending social gatherings to occasionally refresh yourself,\u201d I said cheerfully, wearing a forced smile. Instead of answering my subtle invitation, he nodded slightly. It seemed like he wasn\u2019t in a bad mood now, so I decided to use this opening to give him his pendant and cufflinks.\u201cThis is the pendant you left in the library some time ago, Father.\u201d I gave him the object, which he took impassively.\u201cI see that it was in your possession until now,\u201d he said indifferently. I briefly wondered if he even knew that he had misplaced it, but that thought disappeared when I realized that his response was natural, given his dry personality.\u2018He will probably receive the gift the same way.\u2019\u00a0Without expecting much, I gave him the box that contained the cufflinks. \u201cHere\u2019s this, too.\u201dMy father glared at the box and asked, \u201cWhat\u2026 is this?\u201d His voice held a little hesitation, which was unlike him.\u201cIt\u2019s a gift,\u201d I said before he could comment any further, in case he thought it was something strange. \u201cYou can open it.\u201dHe silently unwrapped the box and did as I said. When he saw the cufflinks, his eyes widened.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe stayed silent, so I assumed that he didn\u2019t like my gift very much.\u00a0\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter because I had already expected this reaction.\u201cI was reminded of you when I went shopping recently. I bought this because I thought it would compliment you,\u201d I added with a casual laugh, to which he nodded.\u2018Well, I\u2019m glad he accepted the gift. If he refused it, I would have to give it to Geraldine\u2026\u2019\u00a0Geraldine wasn\u2019t just a vassal or the head of the Floyen knights; he was also my cousin from my mother\u2019s side. Since the custom was to give cufflinks to both family members and lovers, he was the most suitable option besides my father, as it would prove that I had purchased it for platonic purposes. He was also needed to show up at Rose\u2019s banquet as my partner. Doing so would imply that I still nursed a wounded heart and had no intention of dating other people at the moment.In this scenario, my father wouldn\u2019t be able to force me to meet someone on the marriage list. High society was unusually obsessed with appearances, so if people found out that my father arranged a blind date for his heartbroken daughter, he would be criticized. This plan was the best way to resolve the problem concerning the marriage list, as well as the rumors.\u201cAbout my partner\u2026\u201d I trailed off, but my father nodded at me to go on. \u201cI know you are very busy, Father, but for the banquet tomorrow\u2014\u201dI wanted to ask him if I could borrow Geraldine, his precious subordinate and nephew, but my father\u2019s low voice cut me off. \u201cAlright.\u201d\u2018Did you know what I was going to say, Father?\u2019\u00a0Although I was confused, I decided not to question his decision in case he might change his mind.\u00a0\u2018Now that I have my father\u2019s permission, I need to ask Geraldine to go to the banquet with me.\u2019Everything was working out as smoothly as I had planned. I picked up a madeleine and was about to take a bite when my father suddenly looked at me and said, \u201cSince that\u2019s your wish, I\u2019ll accompany you to the banquet.\u201dI dropped the madeleine that was in my hand.\u00a0\u2018That wasn\u2019t part of my plan, Father!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Confusion and AngerAct 5. As Planned?The young man was standing in a tower next to Madam Fresia\u2019s salon with a confused expression.\u00a0\u2018That woman. What in the world is she planning?\u2019\u00a0Max neither understood why she looked at him with those eyes nor why she was so kind to him.\u00a0\u2018What does she want me to do\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max recalled Jubelian\u2019s face, then sighed. He was discomfited by her caring eyes, which were devoid of expectations, and suddenly felt distressed.\u2018This is pathetic. I have no reason to see that woman anymore, so why am I always thinking about her?\u2019\u00a0Max tried to erase her existence from his mind, but he was strangely reminded of her smiling expression and friendly eyes time and time again.\u00a0\u2018Dang it!\u2019\u00a0When Max\u2019s expression twisted violently, the door swung open.\u201cOh, dear. Why do you look so irritated, my lord?\u201d\u201cIf you have something to report, say it and leave,\u201d Max replied coldly.\u2018He doesn\u2019t need to be so hostile when I\u2019m simply worried about him.\u2019\u00a0Although Fresia was displeased, she managed to control her expression.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Your stand-in Victor has sent a letter.\u201d\u201cConcerning?\u201d\u201cAh, it seems like the emperor\u2019s envoys are refusing to return to the imperial palace because Your Highness keeps delaying your return to the capital.\u201dSimply put, he was now under surveillance. A bloodthirsty smile appeared on Max\u2019s face. \u201cHe was the one who delayed my return indefinitely when I wanted to go back before. Why can\u2019t he wait a little longer now?\u201d he wondered out loud, then continued with a cold voice. \u201cTell Victor that his actions must be flawless.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d Fresia was about to leave the room, but she suddenly turned around as if she just remembered something. \u201cAh, about Lady Floyen. It seems like she will be ignored by many people at the banquet since there are rumors that she doesn\u2019t get along with her father.\u201dMax had barely managed to forget about her, but now he was reminded of her again. He twisted his expression and said angrily, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to report anything about her from now on.\u201d\u2018He was so curious about her until now. What caused this change of heart?\u2019\u00a0Fresia was puzzled, but she nodded, knowing how capricious her lord could be.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d She tried to leave again, but a soft voice stopped her.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d she asked, dumbfounded.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you at least finish the work you\u2019ve started?\u201d Max asked coldly.No matter how hard she tried, Fresia couldn\u2019t keep up with her lord.\u00a0\u2018What on earth is he talking about?\u2019* * *\u201cHave you decided to attend Count Arlo\u2019s banquet this week, Lady Daffodil?\u201d\u201cOf course. And you, Lady Cosmos?\u201d\u201cYes, I will be attending as well.\u201dIn Madam Fresia\u2019s salon, nobles concealed their identity with masks and aliases. Now they were busy talking about Count Arlo\u2019s banquet, which would take place over the weekend. This was natural, given that the person at the very center of the rumor mill these days had unexpectedly decided to attend the banquet.\u201cI\u2019m really curious about who Lady Floyen\u2019s partner is going to be. What do you think, Madam?\u201dFresia was quietly drinking a glass of expensive liquor in the corner. When all the attention turned on her, she smiled as if she indeed knew something. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. She might attend with her relative, Sir Ronel\u2026 or she might come alone.\u201d\u201cOh my! What makes you think that?\u201dFresia took another sip of the amber drink and parted her red lips. \u201cIf she enters with another man after breaking up with Sir Mikhail, she will only be adding fuel to the fire. But if she enters with a relative such as Sir Ronel, or even alone, she will be able to avoid criticism.\u201dEveryone admired her speculations.\u201cNow that I think about it, it\u2019s not a bad idea for her to enter alone,\u201d someone said.\u201cAlthough there is a lot of talk regarding her behavior, many noblemen have long admired her beauty.\u201d\u201cAs expected of Madam Fresia! How wise!\u201dFresia laughed at the compliments, and the corner of her eyes wrinkled. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s all uncertain. I just made a guess.\u201d\u201cEven so, your insights are amazing!\u201dFresia\u2019s smile became more prominent.\u00a0\u2018What\u2019s amazing is that you people can\u2019t even think this far.\u201d\u00a0Even so, it felt nice to be at the center of attention, even if the target of the people\u2019s admiration was not her but the character she was playing. Fresia slightly raised the corner of her lips as she continued to drink out of her glass.\u201cWill you be attending the banquet as well, Madam?\u201dWhen someone asked her this question, Fresia recalled what her lord had said.\u201cFresia, attend the banquet and approach Lady Floyen. If she gets into trouble, help her. I\u2019m asking you to do this because she might be useful in the future, not because I like her.\u2019She had been ordered to take care of Lady Floyen, as well keep watch on her. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough\u2026\u201cJust in case, I will also attend the banquet and keep an eye on her.\u201dHer unpredictable lord was also going to follow her to the banquet!\u00a0\u2018Why does he give me so many tedious tasks? I\u2019ll have to assist the rumored lady and selfish master all by myself!\u2019\u00a0Fresia sighed, brooding over her lord\u2019s command. Then she gathered herself and met the noblewoman\u2019s curious gazes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Confusion and Anger\u201cAh, yes. I received an invitation, so I must go,\u201d Fresia said with a graceful tone.\u2018Not going means disobeying a direct order. I have no choice.\u2019\u00a0She sighed and downed more liquor. The nobles around her didn\u2019t seem to understand her thoughts, so they started to chatter again.\u201cThen we can make a bet about the lady\u2019s partner,\u201d a noblewoman joked while laughing. Instead of answering her, Fresia nodded and laughed along.At that moment, another lady asked a question that she had been withholding. \u201cWhat happens if Lady Floyen attends by herself, as Madam speculated? We will never be able to ascertain whether the rumors about her are true, will we?\u201d\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not true. We can just find the person with the cufflinks!\u201d another woman said. As they began guessing among themselves, Fresia didn\u2019t feel the need to intervene and continued to drink without a word.\u201cBy the way, I heard that the successor of Marquis Hessen, Sir Mikhail, will be attending the banquet as well.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Everyone showed interest in the news that the parted lovers were going to reunite at the banquet hall.\u201cI wonder who his partner will be.\u201d\u201cMe too! He\u2019s so handsome that Lady Floyen did all sorts of things for him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s very competent as well\u2026 I\u2019m sure many of the young ladies want to be his partner.\u201d All the women in the salon smiled happily, thinking about Mikhail\u2019s outstanding appearance.\u201cHe must be relieved that the lady who used to harass him has found a new lover\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right! They were said to be lovers, but Sir Mikhail didn\u2019t reciprocate her feelings. It\u2019s well-known that Lady Floyen was the only one in love.\u201dFresia nodded slightly in agreement, but her smile fell from her lips when a man passed by her table.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s very drunk.\u2019\u00a0Although the dreadful people who gathered in this salon acted refined for appearance\u2019s sake, there were occasions when people couldn\u2019t control their impulses and threw a fit.\u2018Not in my salon.\u2019\u00a0It was enough that her lord caused trouble a few days ago. Fresia frowned and beckoned a guard who was standing nearby.\u00a0\u2018Watch that guy,\u2019\u00a0she commanded. The guard carefully followed the man without making a sound, as was expected from an elite member of her information guild.\u2018It looks like he\u2019s leaving.\u2019\u00a0The exit was right around the corner, which meant his task would be over soon. At that moment, the man who he had been following suddenly turned around, and to his surprise, approached him.\u00a0\u2018Huh?\u2019\u00a0The guard tried to defend himself, but the man\u2019s hands were faster.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d he asked angrily. The guard could tell he wasn\u2019t an ordinary person, as he possessed a sort of advanced agility that could overpower his opponent instantly.\u2018What on earth is he?\u2019\u00a0Although the guard was confused, he responded quickly to manage the situation. \u201cOh\u2026 I thought you were very drunk, so I was worried.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes peered through his mask and observed the guard. When he saw the salon\u2019s badge on his jacket, he loosened his grip.\u201cI\u2019m not drunk,\u201d he said. Then he turned back around and headed for the exit. The guard stared at his retreating back with a blank expression, wondering what he should do, then sighed.\u2018It\u2019s alright. He didn\u2019t cause a commotion, and he\u2019s leaving anyway\u2026 It won\u2019t make a difference if I continue following him or not.\u2019\u00a0After making this judgment, the guard went back to the main hall. The man who he had been following boarded a carriage with a covered household seal.\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201dAfter informing the coachman of his destination, the man took off his mask. A pained, twisted expression was soon revealed.\u00a0\u2018Jubelian,\u2019\u00a0he thought.Even if she had deceived him, the man had tried to ignore any news of her, thinking that it would be a waste of time to care about her any longer. But now that it became clear that the rumors were true, he couldn\u2019t act like before.\u2018Did you really give cufflinks to another man? To a lowly person who can\u2019t even reveal his identity at that\u2026!\u2019\u00a0Mikhail\u2019s expression crumpled in anger, although he still couldn\u2019t understand why he felt this way. He then recalled how Jubelian used to cling to him.\u201cI only did that because I was so upset about you spending time with someone else, Mikhail. It won\u2019t happen again, so please don\u2019t abandon me.\u201dJubelian was someone who always repeated the same mistakes while endlessly clinging to him. He thought he would only feel happiness when they parted, but every time he heard about her, he only felt anger.\u2018Why does this woman make me feel this way\u2026!\u2019\u00a0Mikhail clenched his fists, confused by his emotions. His eyes suddenly lit up when he thought about the very thing that would hurt her.\u00a0\u2018Yes, you\u2019ll surely be regretful if you see me with another woman, Jubelian!\u2019Mikhail slowly closed his eyes, pledging to make the woman who deceived him suffer. Although his heart strangely ached, he assumed it was because of all the drinks he had.* * *I entered my room and sighed.\u00a0\u2018Ah, what do I do now? I never planned for my father to be my partner.\u2019\u00a0If I went with him to the banquet, I would have to be careful with every little thing I did. I worried about how to act for a while, but when it became too cumbersome to worry any longer, I quickly concluded,\u00a0\u2018It won\u2019t be a problem if I stay as quiet as possible. No one will even know I\u2019m there.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - The Truth Behind the GossipsTime passed until it was finally the day of the banquet. The carriage ride to Count Arlo\u2019s residence was a little boring, as I could only see a series of indistinguishable buildings near the capital. The view reminded me of downtown Seoul, where it was also crowded with similar-looking skyscrapers.\u2018Ah, everything near the capital looks the same. There\u2019s nothing interesting to see.\u2019I wanted to yawn because I strangely felt tired, but I restrained myself, afraid that my father might scold me for showing an unrefined appearance.\u00a0\u2018Ah, I\u2019m so sleepy.\u2019\u00a0My vision was beginning to blur when I heard his voice.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dI glanced at my father, who was looking out the window.\u201cI will stay by your side today,\u201d he continued.I didn\u2019t know why he was saying this, but it seemed like he was uneasy about what other people would think about our family. They might find it strange if we entered as partners but interacted awkwardly. He was probably concerned about me causing a scene at the banquet too.\u2018I\u2019m mostly worried about you, Father\u2026\u2019\u00a0I couldn\u2019t figure out what he was thinking lately, so I was nervous that he might interfere with my plans. Nevertheless, I wore a smile to cover up my true thoughts.\u201cOh, I appreciate that you\u2019re coming with me, Father.\u201d\u2018As long as I don\u2019t make any mistakes today, there won\u2019t be any problems.\u2019\u00a0At that moment, I noticed my father smiling softly as he continued to look out the window.\u2018What is he smiling at?\u2019\u00a0I turned around to look outside the window as well. A pretty mansion was surrounded by flower beds brimming with red roses, giving it a lively appearance. We had arrived at Count Arlo\u2019s townhouse, which was located at the capital\u2019s outskirts.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s a pretty house, just as Rose said.\u2019I was staring blankly at the beautiful mansion when my father said, \u201cJubelian.\u201dI turned my attention to him, then saw him reaching out to me.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.I looked at his hand for a moment, then tentatively took it. I held it delicately in case it would bother him, but he grabbed my hand tightly.* * *\u201cAnnouncing Duke Regis Adrey Floyen and his esteemed daughter, Lady Jubelian Eloy Floyen!\u201dThe banquet hall stirred at the herald\u2019s introduction, especially since the famous Duke Floyen usually didn\u2019t attend social events. As everyone held their breaths, the picturesque father and daughter duo entered the banquet hall. Those who saw them gaped in astonishment. Lady Floyen was dressed in a white dress embroidered with gold threads. She looked so beautiful and elegant that for a moment, her notoriety escaped everyone\u2019s thoughts.\u201cHer reputation precedes her beauty,\u201d someone said.As they admired her, the duke gently wrapped his arm around his daughter\u2019s shoulders. Their attention immediately followed his movements, and everyone noticed that he was wearing a white robe that matched her dress. Despite his age, the duke was still youthful and handsome, comparable to a man in his twenties. The only part of his appearance that revealed his age was his sunken eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s His Grace, Duke Floyen, right?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s attended a banquet.\u201dUnmarried ladies, as well as noble ladies who had admired him in the past, blushed when they saw him.\u201cHe still looks great.\u201d\u201cYes, he does.\u201dThe nobles stared at Duke Floyen as if they were possessed, following his movements as he slightly raised his hand. When he revealed something shiny under his sleeve, everyone realized what it was and widened their eyes.\u2018That is\u2026!\u2019\u00a0The blue diamond cufflinks that everyone had been looking for could be seen on the duke\u2019s wrists, gleaming from the light. The nobles were mesmerized for a moment, realizing why they hadn\u2019t seen the cufflinks until now.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018If they were a gift for him, it makes sense why the cufflinks hadn\u2019t appeared. The duke usually doesn\u2019t wear accessories and spends most of his time at home now\u2026\u2019The man in question slowly observed the banquet hall. His cold eyes seemed to warn people to not draw hasty conclusions, making onlookers recoil with fright. Even so, some people smiled in response to his frightening gaze. Rose glanced at her mother with an elated expression, since she had been scolded by her for exchanging letters with Jubelian.\u2018Are you seeing this? I told you Lady Floyen wasn\u2019t at fault,\u2019\u00a0her gaze seemed to say. Countess Arlo fanned herself with embarrassment. Other nobles who had believed in the rumors looked away in embarrassment as well. There was only one man who fixed his gaze on the duo.\u2018What? The cufflinks were for the duke?\u2019\u00a0It was Mikhail, Jubelian\u2019s ex-boyfriend.\u2018Of course. She can\u2019t possibly have eyes for anyone else besides me.\u2019\u00a0He stared at Jubelian and slowly raised the corner of his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - The Truth Behind the GossipsAs soon as I entered the banquet hall, I detected the scent of lilies.\u2018Wow, what a pretty house.\u2019\u00a0Rose\u2019s mansion wasn\u2019t as big as ours, but the antique interior sported mahogany walls, lily decorations, and cream-colored fabrics that made the place look elegant and spacious.\u2018I might live somewhere like this when I become independent.\u2019\u00a0My current home was made entirely out of white marble, so the servants had to do a lot more work than usual to clean it every day. In addition to sweeping and wiping the floors and walls, they also had to polish them. For this reason, I always felt bad when I came home after spending my day outside on a rainy day.\u2018I\u2019ll decorate the interior with wood when I live on my own! It\u2019ll be nice to have a rocking chair in the library as well.\u2019\u00a0I was planning out my future when my father suddenly released my hand and wrapped his arm around my shoulders.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Just have fun.\u201d\u2018What? I was daydreaming about my bright future without any worries.\u2019I was dumbfounded by his words when he took off his hand and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t forget whose daughter you are.\u201dI gulped nervously and flashed a smile. For some reason, my hands were starting to get sweaty.\u00a0\u2018He will probably kill me if I make a mistake today.\u2019\u00a0Even if my father didn\u2019t warn me, I had every intention to behave properly and attend this banquet inconspicuously.\u201cWe greet our empire\u2019s hero and his daughter.\u201dThe Arlo family rose from their seats and stepped forward to greet us, as it was customary for the host and his family to greet guests of higher status. I observed the girl who seemed to be around my age, standing at the very end. As soon as our eyes met, she smiled like a blossoming flower.\u2018Rose. Now that I\u2019m looking at her closely, she seems to be a very lovely lady.\u2019\u00a0I could only recall Mikhail\u2019s appearance from the memories of the past Jubelian, so other people were merely formless figures.\u2018It seems like I had been missing out on a lot of precious things\u2026\u2019\u00a0People would often overlook the stars in the night sky because they were distracted by all kinds of artificial lights and neon signs. My past life was like that as well. But now, I simply wanted to live happily and enjoy what I had missed out, instead of obsessing over Mikhail, the very light that had been distracting me.\u2018To do that, I must be reserved today and go home without making any mistakes.\u2019\u00a0As I repeated this inside my head, members of the Arlo family bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for Your Grace and the lady to attend my daughter\u2019s birthday banquet,\u201d Count Arlo said.After the royalty, dukes were the highest rank in the hierarchy, so we weren\u2019t expected to maintain the same formality. My father opened his mouth after bowing silently.\u201cHappy birthday, esteemed daughter of Count Arlo.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Grace.\u201dThe scene of Rose receiving a congratulatory message from my father highlighted the fact that she was the banquet\u2019s main character. She approached me while I was still observing her, then took my hands.\u201cThank you for coming today, Lady Floyen.\u201dAlthough this was the first time I was seeing her in person, she was very friendly to me. Perhaps it was because of all the letters we wrote to each other, but I also felt very close to her.\u201cHappy birthday, Rose,\u201d I greeted. Then I turned around to look at Merilyn, who was holding her present. Noblewomen usually exchanged expensive perfumes, poetry books, tea leaves, and teacups as gifts. What I had prepared was neither flashy nor substandard, which made me think she was at least not going to become offended by it. When I signaled Merilyn, she presented the gift.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dI smiled at Rose, who was looking at the box with slightly trembling eyes. \u201cI sincerely prepared this small gift for you, my dear friend.\u201dRose burst into bright laughter, her eyes brimming with anticipation. \u201cAh, thank you so very much!\u201dAlthough her smile exuded a teenage-like vitality, the countess frowned at her daughter\u2019s reaction, which may have seemed unrefined by some onlookers.\u00a0\u2018Hm\u2026 As expected from a lady who\u2019s rumored to be strict.\u2019\u00a0Even so, her displeased reaction was somewhat justified, as her daughter was being friendly towards a lady rumored to be rude.\u201cYou can hand the gift to me,\u201d a servant said.As the servant accepted the gift from Merilyn, I noticed that Rose was looking at the box with curiosity. Although it was good manners to check gifts after the banquet was over, an exception could be made if the guest gave permission to open them.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s not a big deal, so it should be okay,\u2019\u00a0I thought. I smiled at Rose, who continued to stare at the gift box with eyes full of anticipation.\u201cYou can open it if you\u2019re curious,\u201d I encouraged.Rose didn\u2019t hesitate at my approval. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.She took the gift with twinkling eyes, then unwrapped the ribbon and opened the box to reveal what was inside. The black object was almost as big as a fist, but it was shaped like a flat cylinder. The surface possessed a smooth luster and bore a delicately crafted red rose on the top, giving it a very beautiful appearance.\u2018Even so, it doesn\u2019t serve a great purpose.\u2019\u00a0Rose soon opened the lid and widened her eyes. Any young lady who wore makeup could identify the fluffy velvet puff, which was somewhat thinner than the ones used here. Its design was also improved to look like the portable compact powder with an attached mirror commonly used in my past life.\u2018Well, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll like this gift very much because it\u2019s just a modification of something that already exists\u2026\u2019\u00a0Rose had been murmuring to herself, but at that moment, she frowned slightly.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s probably disappointed. It seems like she doesn\u2019t need my gift because her maids already carry all her makeup supplies.\u2019I was a bit taken aback because I didn\u2019t think her reaction would be this bad, but her disappointment was justified when I thought about it again. She had spent so much time writing letters to me, but I had given her such a common gift.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m just grateful that she wrote me all those letters until now.\u2019\u00a0I tried to be unfeeling about this situation, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry that she had been so kind to an outsider like me.\u201cI should get going now\u2026\u201dI was about to leave when Rose\u2019s voice held me back. \u201cPlease wait for a second, Lady Floyen.\u201dI braced for what was coming, wondering if she was going to criticize me, but her next words were so unexpected that I doubted having heard them correctly.\u201cTo give me such an innovative gift! I\u2019m touched.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Dancing with My Father\u2019s DiscipleAt first glance, Jubelian\u2019s gift looked suspicious to many onlookers.\u00a0\u2018What is that?\u2019\u00a0Everyone observed the flat, round object decorated with a rose. It looked like a small, aesthetically pleasing container used for storing miscellaneous accessories, but it was difficult to tell if that was actually the gift\u2019s purpose. It was only when Rose opened the case did people exclaim.\u2018Puff? Is that a powder container?\u2019\u00a0Everyone felt like they had been hit with a ton of bricks. When noblewomen went out, a maid would usually bring puff to correct their makeup throughout the day. But since this was impossible to do if they weren\u2019t accompanied by a maid, a dull and greasy face was a discomfort many ladies had to endure alone. Jubelian\u2019s gift easily solved this common problem.\u201cOh, a powder container small and thin enough to fit inside a purse!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it before.\u201d\u201cTo think of such an object and request production of it\u2026 incredible.\u201dThe object was both charming and practical, so it was no wonder many eyes possessed a covetous gleam.\u201cIf she\u2019s presenting something like that, wouldn\u2019t this year\u2019s Star go to Lady Floyen?\u201dThe Star was a brooch awarded to the person who spearheaded the biggest trend in high society that year. This annual event was a great honor, as nobles tended to be sensitive about outward appearances.\u201cI agree. Seeing as so many people\u2019s eyes are already shining\u2026 Isn\u2019t that a sign it\u2019ll become a trend?\u201d\u201cOf course, but I doubt Lady Floyen will disclose which workshop she ordered it from.\u201dAlthough everyone was curious about this, it was a sensitive subject because nobles rarely disclosed such information. Moreover, it was difficult to approach the lady in question, who was notorious for her wickedness. As everyone cowered, someone struck a conversation with Lady Floyen and brought up what no one dared to ask. The girl was none other than Rose, the star of today\u2019s banquet.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, could you tell me the workshop you commissioned to make this powder container, Lady Floyen? I would like to order one for my mother as well.\u201dEven those who had openly disapproved of Jubelian were nervous by this situation. If she was the Lady Floyen they thought they knew, she wouldn\u2019t stop at just causing trouble. Unexpectedly, a soft voice came from Jubelian\u2019s red lips.\u201cAh, it was Fyodor\u2019s workshop. The craftsman is young but skilled, so you can trust him.\u201dMany people became amazed by her smooth response.\u201cThank you so much for giving me this valuable information,\u201d Rose gushed.Jubelian waved her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m quite embarrassed by your extensive praise, so I\u2019m not sure how to react. I can only thank you for liking the gift I gave you.\u201dShe had not only answered, but also answered humbly. At this point, people were wondering if someone was impersonating the lady. While everyone\u2019s minds were in disarray, it was Countess Arlo, Rose\u2019s mother and the lady of the Arlo household, who set out to calm the chaotic atmosphere.\u201cI am very pleased that you gave my daughter an unforgettable gift today.\u201dIn response to her gratitude, Jubelian gracefully lowered her head. \u201cAnd I am honored to have been invited to such a high-class banquet, Countess,\u201d she said.The countess unconsciously marveled at her response.\u00a0\u2018This lady is pretty good.\u2019\u00a0Jubelian had not only praised the Arlo family and other guests but also herself to avoid seeming servile. She had truly mastered the aristocratic manner of only saying what was necessary. The countess\u2019s expression, which had been frozen like ice in the middle of winter, became warm like the spring breeze.\u201cI hope you have a great time, Lady Floyen.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dWhen Jubelian expressed her gratitude, the countess and her husband bowed at Duke Floyen, who stood next to her. The duke likewise bowed in silence, then reached out to his daughter.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThey walked toward the corner of the banquet hall. It was usually an inconspicuous spot, but everyone\u2019s attention strayed there to observe the lady.\u201cHow can she be so different?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s really pretty when she smiles. Did you catch a glimpse of her face?\u201dIn response to the numerous praises from the surrounding noblewomen, who had been gossiping about Lady Floyen just yesterday, Countess Arlo spread her fan.\u201cMy daughter certainly has an eye for people. The lady I met today was befitting of Duke Floyen\u2019s prestigious household.\u201dPeople noticed her shift in attitude and nodded in agreement.* * *I sighed softly as the banquet hall became noisy, a bit taken aback by everyone\u2019s unexpected attention.\u00a0\u2018I thought it was a simple gift\u2026 but I guess it wasn\u2019t.\u2019\u2018This isn\u2019t what I wanted.\u2019\u00a0I forced a smile, tired from all the unanticipated curiosity I drew from other people.\u00a0\u2018I want to go home and rest.\u2019At that moment, my father reached out to me. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIt would be nice to go home at this point, but we simply moved to a set of chairs by the window and sat down.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s a bit awkward to sit with my father like this.\u2019\u00a0I looked at him with this thought, but he was staring at a distant place with a cold expression.\u2018It seems like being here has put him in a bad mood.\u2019\u00a0Although I didn\u2019t force him to come with me, I felt somewhat uncomfortable.\u00a0\u2018No, I shouldn\u2019t pay so much attention to him.\u2019I turned away from my father and looked at the center of the banquet hall, where men and women were dancing in pairs.\u00a0\u2018What a pretty sight.\u2019\u00a0I was quite entertained by the beautifully dressed couples moving expertly, so much so that I felt like I was watching a splendid performance of professional dancers.\u00a0\u2018As I thought, it\u2019s more fun to watch other people dance than to dance myself.\u2019I was still sitting next to my father when I saw the backside of a familiar figure, who was surrounded by many women.\u00a0\u2018Huh? He looks a bit like Mikhail. Is that him?\u2019Even if it were really him, I remembered the warning I had given to him in the past.\u00a0\u201cFine, I\u2019ll trust you. Just don\u2019t appear in front of me ever again,\u201d\u00a0I had said.\u2018It\u2019s a small world, but he couldn\u2019t have possibly come to this banquet, right?\u2019\u00a0I knew that Mikhail didn\u2019t enjoy banquets, so it was unlikely it was actually him. The last thing I wanted to do was get involved with him since many people perceived him as a pitiful, handsome man who had been harassed by me, a villainess, for two years.\u201cI\u2019ll go to the terrace and stay there for a while, Father.\u201dHe sighed in response and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dI had been worried that he would order me to fulfill my responsibility as his partner, so I was relieved that he granted me permission. I rose from my seat in a good mood when he spoke again.\u201cDon\u2019t forget that I\u2019m here.\u201dWhen he said those words, a burdensome feeling weighed on me.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t even rest in peace.\u2019\u00a0The thought of staying in the banquet hall any longer made me exhausted, so I trudged towards the terrace.* * *Many people watched Lady Floyen enter the terrace with regretful gazes.\u00a0\u2018Ah, it\u2019s a pity I couldn\u2019t ask her to be my partner.\u2019\u00a0The duke\u2019s hostile glare prevented people from approaching her, much less asking her to be their partner.Mikhail frowned. As one of these people, he had been conscious about Jubelian\u2019s presence since she entered the banquet hall.\u00a0\u2018She went to the terrace. Is she signaling for me?\u2019\u00a0He was about to follow Jubelian when Duke Floyen, who had been sitting, stood up and leaned against the wall near the entrance to the terrace.\u2018Darn it!\u2019\u00a0Mikhail couldn\u2019t even move one step forward because the man who had once shown him favor was now exuding candid hostility. Although this uncomfortable encounter left Mikhail feeling uneasy, Regis lifted a corner of his lips.\u2018This is ridiculous. I can\u2019t believe he was such an unpleasant person.\u2019In the past, Regis approved of Mikhail simply because Jubelian liked him. But now that they had parted ways, Regis couldn\u2019t bother with someone who was nothing more than a nuisance. When he turned around, the duke relaxed his fierce gaze.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t ruin the banquet my daughter is enjoying just to deal with a bug like him.\u2019* * *When I left the stuffy banquet hall and entered the terrace, I felt like it was easier to breathe. Because I was on the first floor, the Arlo family\u2019s garden sprawled out in front of me.\u2018It\u2019s nice that it\u2019s quiet.\u2019\u00a0I stared blankly at the garden and took a deep breath. The wind carried a fresh and fragrant scent towards me. Although the colorful flowers were trimmed by human hands, they were still beautiful products of nature. I began to feel at ease as I watched the roses sway in the wind.\u00a0\u2018I should move to the countryside when I become independent. It\u2019ll be a good idea to plant some flowers and start a farm as well.\u2019As I was making a plan for my future, my eyelids slowly lowered.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m sleepy.\u2019\u00a0I felt them getting heavier. I was about to rub my eyes unconsciously when I stopped.\u00a0\u2018I almost forgot I had makeup on. I could\u2019ve messed it up if I touched my face.\u2019At that moment, I felt the sudden urge to yawn, so I covered my mouth and exhaled with a lowered head.\u00a0\u2018Ah, the tears are coming out again. The makeup shouldn\u2019t be erased because of a few tears, right?\u2019\u00a0They always came out when I yawned, but I couldn\u2019t help this physiological phenomenon.\u2018I left my powder compact at home\u2026\u2019\u00a0I nonetheless wiped my tears, hoping there wouldn\u2019t be an unfortunate event where I had to correct my makeup.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dI turned towards the direction of the familiar voice and saw a very attractive face come into view. He was the last person I had expected to see.\u00a0\u2018What is my father\u2019s disciple doing here?\u2019\u201cHey, how did you\u2026?\u201d I tried asking him for an explanation but stopped short when his long, masculine fingers gently wiped the area around my eyes.\u201cDid someone harass you by any chance?\u201d he asked with a harsh voice, akin to a beast\u2019s growl. Unlike his tender touch, which had wiped away my tears, my father\u2019s disciple stared at me with fierce red eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - Dancing with My Father\u2019s DiscipleThe man glanced at the azure sky, vibrant roses, crowded banquet hall, and lovey-dovey guests who displayed affection on the terrace. As someone who had survived many near-death experiences, Max felt irritated and uncomfortable by his surroundings.\u2018It might be difficult to find each other, so please stay at the arranged meeting place, Your Highness,\u201d\u00a0Fresia had told him. Max tried to endure his boredom by thinking about her earnest request, but this was difficult to do, considering that he had already been hiding in a tree all day long.\u2018Should I just leave?\u2019\u00a0Although he wanted to abandon the plan and return to Salon Blooms right away, he practiced patience.\u201cAh, about Lady Floyen. It seems like she will be ignored by many people at the banquet since there are rumors that she doesn\u2019t get along with her father,\u201d\u00a0Fresia had said.\u2018There is a lot to gain from this banquet.\u2019\u00a0Many nobles who worked at the imperial palace were in attendance. Max decided it would be a good idea to make a mental note of who approached his master and nip them in the bud later.Despite his resolve, Max suddenly thought about Jubelian wearing a gorgeous dress and dancing in someone else\u2019s arms.\u00a0\u2018She should be dancing by now, right?\u2019\u00a0His gaze became increasingly bloodthirsty as he stared at the banquet hall.\u2018If I reveal my identity and go in now\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max was overcome by this intense impulse when the door to the terrace, his arranged meeting place with Fresia, opened. Upon seeing who it was, he widened his eyes.\u2018Jubelian?\u2019\u00a0He thought he was hallucinating at first, so he blinked to confirm that the person who entered the terrace was indeed Jubelian.\u00a0\u2018Why did she come here?\u2019\u00a0Various thoughts crowded his mind, but he felt strangely content by her appearance, so much so that the boring and dull scenery now looked lively.\u00a0\u2018I guess she likes roses, seeing as she\u2019s gazing at them so seriously.\u2019Max unconsciously smiled as he observed her, but he was soon puzzled by what she did next.\u00a0\u2018Wait, why is she lowering her head?\u2019\u00a0When Jubelian lifted her head back up again, he realized why.\u00a0\u2018Is she crying?\u2019\u00a0He thought he was hallucinating again, but the sight of her tears dripping down her jewel-like, periwinkle eyes was unmistakable.At that moment, Fresia\u2019s earnest words occurred to Max again.\u00a0\u2018It might be difficult to find each other, so please stay at the arranged meeting place, Your Highness,\u201d\u00a0she had said.Max paid no heed to her request and jumped off the tree.* * *I stared at my father\u2019s disciple and frowned slightly.\u00a0\u2018What is he suddenly saying?\u2019\u00a0I didn\u2019t know what he thought of me, but I was still the only daughter of a duke. Although I was infamous for being vicious to others and never having to experience difficulties, it seemed like he thought I was a pushover because I had been kind to him.\u201cTell me,\u201d my father\u2019s disciple said in a bloodthirsty tone as if interrogating me.I stared at him. \u201cIf I tell you who harassed me, are you going to punish that person?\u201d\u201cYes. I promised to help you, after all,\u201d he responded immediately.I sighed, dumbfounded by how he had so casually distorted my words.\u00a0\u2018Foolish guy, helping me will bring you closer to death!\u2019\u00a0Although I had overlooked his arrogance because I didn\u2019t want to seem overbearing and haughty, other nobles wouldn\u2019t be as forgiving. They considered it mutiny for commoners to speak informally to nobles, unhesitant to dole out harsh punishments right away. As a commoner, he would meet the same end if he used force against a nobleman. Perhaps that wouldn\u2019t even be enough.\u2018He could be bluffing, but this person\u2026 he might actually do such a thing.\u2019\u00a0After observing my father\u2019s disciple for a few days, I realized that he didn\u2019t know many social norms, almost as if he was raised in the wild. His mind was like a blank sheet of paper that could lead to his death if he wasn\u2019t careful.\u00a0\u2018We\u2019ve known each other for quite a while, so I can\u2019t let him die.\u2019\u00a0Although we weren\u2019t close, I sometimes felt comfortable with this person. He didn\u2019t seem to have any ulterior motives and treated me like a normal person, instead of the unapproachable Lady Floyen.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dHe turned to me. \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf you want to help me going forward, please speak to me formally in public,\u201d I said\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as if I had said something ridiculous.\u201cI\u2019m still in a situation where I\u2019m being ignored by people in high society,\u201d I reiterated. \u201cHow much of a joke will they think I am if you disrespect me as well?\u201dHe stared at me in response, deep in thought. I gazed into his red eyes and said, \u201cYou can make enemies or friends depending on how you say things, especially when it concerns nobles. Although this will be a different story if the class system is abolished, I\u2019m just warning you to be careful.\u201dHis red eyes continued to stare at me when I finished speaking.\u00a0\u2018If he\u2019s dissatisfied, he should just say so instead of looking at me so seriously. Why is he staring at me like that?\u2019\u00a0Before his gaze got even more strange, he slowly nodded.\u2018How nice.\u2019\u00a0He looked like an obedient child when he nodded. I unconsciously felt the urge to stroke his hair, as if to praise him, but hastily pulled my hand back before I did.\u201cOh, why are you here at the banquet?\u201d I asked.\u201cBecause of work,\u201d he responded quietly.Well, this made sense. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for nobles to hire mercenaries as security guards for banquets. I briefly wondered if he was overqualified to work as a temporary guard, but that wasn\u2019t as big of a problem as his appearance, which was very unusual for a commoner.\u201cIf nobles speak to you, you must respond formally. Okay?\u201d I said, making sure he understood to ease my worries.He sighed. \u201cAlright.\u201dDespite his affirmation, I knew how ignorant of the world he was, as well as arrogant, so I stretched out my pinky finger. \u201cPromise me.\u201dHe frowned in response, then sighed and gently hooked his pinky finger around mine. After stamping our thumbs together, he pulled back his hand and spoke with an irritated tone. \u201cBy the way, why did your partner leave you alone, making you look like someone who was abandoned?\u2018Hm, I guess I probably looked like that.\u2019\u00a0The terrace was a place where guests could, in a positive light, take a break. It was also, in a negative light, a place where people could escape if they were left out or unable to acclimate themselves. With my partner being a certain someone, I wasn\u2019t in a situation where I could enjoy the banquet.\u201cMy father is in the banquet hall\u2026\u201dHe stared at me with amazement when I mentioned my father. \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you decide to partner with a relative?\u201d\u201cWell, it ended up being my father.\u201dHe frowned in response and stared at me. \u201cHave you danced yet?\u201dI sighed. \u201cIf someone asked me to dance, would I be acting like someone who was abandoned, as you said?\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, he snickered.\u00a0\u2018Yeah, he probably thinks this is funny.\u2019\u00a0In the past, people often asked me to dance out of reverence for my status as a duke\u2019s daughter. But oddly enough, I hadn\u2019t received a dance request from a single person today.\u2018Well, it\u2019s probably karma for the life I\u2019ve been living until now.\u2019\u00a0I was lost in my thoughts when a hand extended towards me. I looked at my father\u2019s disciple, who wore a serious expression with his outstretched, unwavering hand in the air.\u201cWhy are you extending your hand?\u201d I asked.He slightly frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m asking you to dance with me.\u201d\u201cYou know how to dance?\u201d I asked with surprise. \u201cMy goodness.\u201dHe nodded in response. \u201cYou should be honored. I don\u2019t dance with just anyone,\u201d he said proudly.I was a bit worried that he might step on my feet, but I couldn\u2019t refuse someone who seemed so eager and decided to be generous. I took his outstretched hand. \u201cYes, it would be an honor to dance with you.\u201dAt that moment, I wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me. For a second, he looked like an arrogant prince with a smile filled with confidence, which was quite unusual.\u00a0\u2018His face is really handsome.\u2019\u00a0I was staring at him, almost as if I was possessed when he raised my hand.\u201cThen, let\u2019s start.\u201dThe orchestra echoing across the banquet hall could also be heard at the terrace.\u00a0\u2018I should take the lead, right?\u2019\u00a0I moved slowly, trying to be considerate toward him, a beginner. To my surprise, he began to lead me.\u2018Huh?\u2019\u00a0His steps were too skilled for a beginner; even his guidance was perfect without any faults. It was as if he had practiced dancing many times.\u00a0\u2018How?\u2019\u00a0I stared at him, dumbfounded.\u201cAh!\u201dPerhaps it was because I wasn\u2019t concentrating on my steps, despite wearing high heels, but I missed a step and almost fell.\u201cYou aren\u2019t paying attention,\u201d he scolded.In no time, his red eyes got closer while he hugged my waist tightly. I became flustered and tried to get out of his arms.\u201cIs your ankle okay?\u201d he asked. Although he spoke brusquely, his words showed that he was worried about me. I felt strange for some reason.\u201cAh, it\u2019s okay. Now\u2026\u201dI tried to distance myself, but he suddenly lifted me, bridal style.\u00a0\u2018Wait, what is he doing!\u2019\u00a0As I was taken aback by his unexpected actions, he sat me on a nearby bench and applied something to my ankle. The cool sensation reminded me of a pain relief patch.When I looked at him in amazement, he lowered his head. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I brought this ointment\u2026 If I didn\u2019t, what would you have done?\u201d he complained.\u2018Does he carry around household medicine because he\u2019s a mercenary?\u2019\u00a0I stole a glance at him.\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.He lowered his head further down in response, seeming to become irritated. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say thank you. Just don\u2019t get hurt.\u201dI caught sight of a leaf on top of his head.\u00a0\u2018I should take it down for him.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s done n\u2014\u201dAt that moment, he raised his head slightly. I became embarrassed because it seemed like I was trying to stroke his hair.He took my hand. \u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d\u2018Oh, did I make him mad?\u2019\u00a0His face had turned slightly red, so he must\u2019ve been angry at me. I was about to apologize when I suddenly heard a voice.\u201cWhat the h*ll are you doing?\u201dI turned towards the entrance of the terrace, where my father was staring at us with a terrifying expression.\u201cF-father.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Caught Red-handedRegis initially thought that she was going to take a short break, but Jubelian hadn\u2019t returned from the terrace for a while. As he continued to guard the entrance in the banquet hall, he began to feel nervous.\u00a0\u2018Did something happen to her?\u2019Although the duke possessed the ability to detect the presence of living beings, he deliberately avoided using his powers to survey the terrace out of respect for his daughter\u2019s privacy. But as the minutes ticked by, he began to imagine the worst-case scenario.\u2018If the emperor made a move\u2026\u2019\u00a0Of course, he wouldn\u2019t act so hastily because he possessed \u2018that,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t out of the picture for him to pull a trick. The duke had clearly provoked the emperor during his last audience with him. Refusing to take any chances, Regis activated his powers to detect his daughter\u2019s movements on the terrace.He widened his eyes in astonishment.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s with someone\u2026 a man at that.\u2019\u00a0Regis glared at the door. After briefly detecting Jubelian\u2019s movements, he concluded that she was dealing with someone she knew. Regis had no choice but to act carefully because he didn\u2019t want to disappoint his daughter any further, otherwise she would lose trust in him if he opened the door in these circumstances.\u2018I\u2019ll look at who it is first and do a background check in secret.\u2019\u00a0Although he was trying to be patient as a father, this was becoming harder when the two people on the terrace, who were already close, stepped towards each other.\u2018How dare he\u2026\u2019\u00a0Regis clenched his fists unconsciously. He could tell by their placement of their hands and bodies that they were about to dance.\u2018Who on earth is with that child\u2026\u2019\u00a0After what happened with Mikhail, the duke was nervous at the thought of other unqualified men deceiving his daughter. Now that someone was doing exactly that after evading his attention, Regis became resentful.At that moment, Jubelian staggered. Regis flinched unconsciously, but he didn\u2019t move from his spot because his daughter didn\u2019t fall. The man with her had quickly supported her back. Although he felt relieved, a strange feeling washed over him. When Jubelian passed out, he wished it was a nightmare he could wake up from. But when he couldn\u2019t, his heart was consumed by fear and anxiety that she might pass out without notice again, especially if she was out of sight.Thankfully, his daughter was safe because of the quick reflexes of the man with her.\u00a0\u2018His instincts are quite useful.\u2019\u00a0Although his strange pride was quite stubborn, he had to admit that there was someone else who could protect his daughter.Regis\u2019s fists tightened as he tried to suppress his impatience.\u00a0\u2018It should be alright if I investigate who he is later\u2026\u2019At that moment, Regis\u2019s eyes became filled with fury.\u00a0\u2018That d*mn b*stard!\u2019\u00a0There was a reason for his sudden outburst of profanities, which he usually didn\u2019t use.\u2018How dare you touch my daughter there!\u2019\u00a0Regis was usually patient, as shown by his interactions with the emperor, who liked to provoke him. But when the delinquent held his daughter and lifted the hem of her skirt, he opened the door roughly. The duke immediately saw the man touching his daughter\u2019s ankle with his head lowered, and his daughter stroking his head.\u2018I don\u2019t know who you are, but I won\u2019t forgive you.\u2019\u00a0When the delinquent raised his head, Regis\u2019s expression stiffened. It was his foolish disciple, whom he had already disqualified as his daughter\u2019s prospective partner.\u2018Maximillian.\u2019\u00a0Despite his handsome appearance and talents, the emperor\u2019s son was an extremely ferocious and arrogant man. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that his perverse and foul personality was below her standards, as well as the average standard. A murderous aura emanated from Regis\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\u2018This guy dares\u2026 to approach my daughter?\u2019\u201cI will not say thank you because you are the one who decided to accept me as your disciple,\u201d\u00a0Max once said. Although his words back there were nothing but arrogant, Regis didn\u2019t become angry at him. He didn\u2019t expect anything in return for helping him, and he wasn\u2019t so petty as to argue with an immature child.Even so, he wanted nothing more than to separate his ungrateful disciple from his daughter right away. And to warn him to never get close to his daughter again, he wanted to beat him up until he came to his senses. This strange sensation made him feel like his head was on fire.\u201cFather?\u201dThe moment Regis saw his daughter staring at him with wide eyes, he knew he couldn\u2019t do this. He exhaled slowly and relaxed his tight fists.\u00a0\u2018Of course, there\u2019s no way I can win against you.\u2019That didn\u2019t mean that he approved of her relationship with his disciple, however. If she decided to stay with him, Regis could clearly see the hardship she would have to undergo.\u00a0\u2018She can do anything else, but she must not get involved with that guy. He\u2019s too dangerous.\u2019Regis decided to pull the two apart and make sure they never met again.* * *When my father suddenly entered the terrace, I became a little nervous and worried that he would blame me for not showing myself at the banquet hall. Contrary to my expectations, my father simply extended his hand.\u201cI\u2019ll ask for more details later. First, let\u2019s leave.\u201dHis reaction was strange, seeing as he didn\u2019t scold me, but I approached my father. \u201cOkay.\u201d I tried to take his hand, but his disciple held me back.\u201cYour ankle. You\u2019re hurt.\u201dI could still walk, so it was a little embarrassing for him to say that. \u201cI\u2019m fi\u2014\u201dMy father smiled kindly and dropped his outstretched hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you should concern yourself with.\u201dI tried to look indifferent, but it seemed like my father was telling his disciple that I was insignificant and not worth caring about.\u00a0\u2018I was wondering why he wasn\u2019t angry. Is it because his disciple is here?\u2019\u00a0My mood was worsening when someone suddenly lifted me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Caught Red-handed\u2018Huh?\u2019\u00a0I looked at my father in surprise, wondering why he was now holding me.\u201cBecause she\u2019s my daughter,\u201d he said with a slight smile.In the past, I would\u2019ve been shaken by his words because I was a child yearning for love, but I wasn\u2019t like that anymore.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t expect anything from him.\u2019\u00a0My past expectations were only false hopes that always let me down. I thought that he might love me if I acted cutely and humored him, but I had no intention of continuing such stupid behavior anymore.\u2018Because I know how this story ends.\u2019\u00a0I was immersed in bitter thoughts for a while when I heard my father speak.\u201cI will visit you in the future, so don\u2019t come to my home anymore.\u201dAs someone who didn\u2019t travel for most things, my father personally told his disciple that he would visit him. It seemed like he really cherished him, but when I glanced at the young man, I saw that he was slightly frowning.\u00a0\u2018Isn\u2019t his expression a little strange for someone who should be deeply moved?\u2019\u00a0I frowned as well.\u2018Wait, Father. Isn\u2019t this a little too much?\u2019\u00a0I didn\u2019t realize that he would enter the banquet hall while holding me like this, but he did.\u201cFather.\u201dWhen I called out to him, his blue eyes turned to me. \u201cYou injured your ankle. There\u2019s no need to push yourself and stay at the banquet.\u201d\u2018No, that\u2019s not it! I want you to let go of me because I\u2019m embarrassed!\u2019\u00a0But if I quarreled with him over this matter, I would only stand out more. The attention I was already receiving was more than enough.\u00a0\u2018I want to disappear quietly.\u2019\u00a0Despite my wishes, reality wasn\u2019t as merciful. As everyone\u2019s attention in the banquet hall turned on us, so did Count Arlo\u2019s, the owner of this mansion.He approached us. \u201cYour Excellency, did something happen\u2026?\u201d\u201cMy daughter isn\u2019t feeling well, so we must depart,\u201d my father said.I sighed.\u00a0\u2018Ah, this is so embarrassing.\u2019My original plan was to go home after quietly attending the banquet, as it was the only way to avoid further backlash. But now I was receiving attention from being held in my father\u2019s arms, with the excuse of feeling sick, on top of the attention I received from my gift to Rose.\u00a0\u2018By tomorrow\u2026 I\u2019ll be the prime subject of gossip.\u2019Well, this wasn\u2019t anything unexpected or surprising because I was often the subject of hostility from many people. But at the thought of suffering from strange rumors again, I began to have a headache.* * *When Duke Floyen and his daughter left the banquet hall, guests who had frequently targeted Jubelian began gossiping.\u201cI can\u2019t believe she caused such a commotion at someone else\u2019s banquet!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand how someone who was doing fine a moment ago could act like that.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not doing this intentionally to get attention, right?\u201dAt that moment, a cold voice fiercely stifled their conversation. \u201cI guess everyone forgot that Lady Floyen was down with an illness a while ago.\u201dAt the words of Rose, the star of the banquet, silence fell upon the banquet hall. She stared at the guests who had just gossiped about Jubelian. \u201cIt seems like she hasn\u2019t fully recovered from her illness, but she came to my birthday banquet despite being unwell\u2026 I think that\u2019s really considerate of her,\u201d she said.Many people began to agree with her words.\u201cJust a while ago, she was sitting with a pale complexion before going out to the terrace.\u201d\u201cYes, I saw that as well.\u201dRose became teary-eyed after listening to this and said, \u201cAlthough it hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve become acquainted with the lady, I have gotten to know her through exchanging letters and feel like she\u2019s a very kind person.\u201dSeveral nobles agreed with Rose and expressed their own opinions.\u201cLady Arlo is right. I didn\u2019t expect anything when I received a letter under her name, but when I learned that Lady Floyen wrote it herself, I realized that its contents were distinctive.\u201dAmong these voices was the esteemed son of Count Rowen as well. \u201cI made the mistake of finding another partner before the lady could answer me. She forgave me nevertheless and looked like an angel while doing so\u2026\u201dRose ignored his words, which were full of ulterior motives, and said, \u201cAs the host of this banquet, I am grateful to her. So\u2026\u201dWhen Rose became at loss for words, Count Arlo wrapped his arm around his daughter\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cDear guests. Since we\u2019re all comrades with the same political position, shouldn\u2019t we all be united? Moreover, if the duke finds out that we have spoken ill of his daughter today\u2026 he will really be disappointed.\u201dGuests who had been gossiping about Jubelian gulped in response. It was known that people slandered the emperor when he wasn\u2019t present, but the atmosphere a little while ago was becoming too overheated. Moreover, the sight of the duke holding Jubelian in his arms was quite different from the rumors, which claimed that their relationship was one of indifference. As the silence settled, Count Arlo smiled pleasantly.\u201cIt seems like liveliness has died down because the music has stopped. Please resume the performance, Maestro.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Unforeseen AftermathWhen the music resumed at the count\u2019s orders, the icy atmosphere of the banquet hall slowly melted away. Some nobles began to quietly whisper among themselves.\u201cThe count is obligated to act amicably towards the Floyen family because the young lady gave his daughter a great gift, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Even if it weren\u2019t for the gift, it seems like the duke truly cares for his daughter\u2026 It would be good for both families to have friendly relations.\u201dAs the general sentiment turned towards Jubelian\u2019s favor, Rose looked at her father proudly. Now that she thought about it, she was able to exchange letters with Lady Floyen in the first place because of the support from her father, Count Arlo.\u201cThank you, Father.\u201dCount Arlo laughed softly at his daughter\u2019s quiet voice of thanks. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve made a good friend.\u201dRose gazed at her father affectionately for a while, then smiled as she recalled Duke Floyen leaving with Jubelian in his arms.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m relieved that the lady has a good relationship with her father as well.\u2019* * *Although I felt much better after leaving the banquet hall, I was still uncomfortable that my father was holding me in his arms. My breaths only relaxed when I saw our household\u2019s carriage in the distance.\u00a0\u2018When we board it, this discomfort will be over.\u2019\u00a0But after we entered the carriage and my father placed me down, I continued to feel tense because he decided to sit right next to me.\u201cYou might pass out like last time, so I\u2019ll stay next to you on our way back home.\u201dUnable to go against his wishes, I forced a smile.* * *Mikhail squeezed his fists as he recalled how Jubelian left the banquet hall.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s not feeling well? Does that mean she wasn\u2019t faking her illness?\u2019Jubelian had always able to follow him wherever he went. Even when he walked quickly, she never fell behind and managed to match his pace. He thought she was a naturally healthy person for this reason, but now that he thought about it, she wouldn\u2019t show herself for days after following him around. She would also have difficulty breathing as she pushed herself to keep up. When Mikhail realized this, his heart strangely began to ache.* * *Because he had suddenly become angry on the terrace, I wondered if my father was going to ask me about what I was doing with his disciple. However, he only left a request before leaving my room.\u00a0\u201cRefrain from going out these next few days. Allen told me that you should rest,\u201d\u00a0he had said.Due to my father\u2019s orders to take care of myself, I was bound to my bed again.\u00a0\u2018Why on earth is he acting like this?\u2019\u00a0He used to treat me like I didn\u2019t exist, but now he was acting so differently. Not only did these changes make me feel uncomfortable around him, but they also made it difficult for me to understand him.\u00a0\u2018What\u2019s the point of being nice to me?\u2019\u00a0I wondered.To my surprise, I realized the answer quickly.\u00a0\u2018Well, I guess there are benefits to treating me like this. He must make sure I\u2019m healthy enough to marry the crown prince, right?\u2019\u00a0When I recalled the crown prince from the original novel, I sighed.\u00a0\u2018It would be unreasonable to try to appease a cruel and inhumane person like him\u2026\u2019I thought that breaking up with Mikhail would derail me from the path to death, but if I had known that I would encounter a bear while trying to avoid a fox, I would\u2019ve found a different solution.\u00a0\u2018Well, the past is the past. I can\u2019t do anything about it now.\u2019I clenched my fists. Although I needed to obey my father for the sake of my bright future, I didn\u2019t want to end my life by getting married to the crown prince.\u00a0\u2018Watch me. This will never go the way you want.\u2019Act 6. Shouldn\u2019t You Answer Before You Go?Max looked at his hands for a while then clenched his fists.\u2018Why do I keep\u2026 thinking about her?\u2019\u00a0The more he tried to forget about her, the more she kept coming to mind. He savored the warmth he felt when his hand entangled with her small, slender fingers, as well as the peculiar sensation he felt when he wrapped his arm around her waist. Max tried to shake these thoughts off by distracting himself, but Jubelian\u2019s image continued to pervade his mind. His heart had tingled when she smiled and stroked his hair. When her red lips smiled, it had been difficult to bear another minute of wondering how they would feel. He had felt like he was floating in a dream.However, that dream had vanished the moment his master appeared, filling Max with resentment.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s been confining her until now.\u2019\u00a0Although Max knew that his master was Jubelian\u2019s father, he couldn\u2019t help but feel angry when he interrupted them. It didn\u2019t help when his master told him to not visit his residence anymore in a threatening tone.Nevertheless, Max reined in his anger because\u2026 the duke was Jubelian\u2019s father before he was his master. He tried to understand him from this perspective, but he could only remember the helplessness he felt as his master carried Jubelian further away in his arms. As he recalled what had happened at the banquet, Max gritted his teeth.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s abusing his powers by intruding on his daughter.\u2019Fresia sighed as she watched Max fuming by himself.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s become even more strange after returning from the banquet.\u2019\u00a0She couldn\u2019t help but be worried for her lord, who was behaving incomprehensibly when the long-prepared rebellion was underway.\u201cFresia.\u201dWhen her lord suddenly called her, she raised her head. Max possessed a serious expression as he stared at her.\u00a0\u2018What does he want to say if he\u2019s looking at me like that?\u2019No matter how strange he had become, Maximillian always used any means necessary to achieve his purpose. Knowing better than to let her guard down in front of this inherently cold-hearted man, Fresia nervously waited for Maximillian to speak. Before long, his lips parted.\u201cSend an invitation in your name, Fresia.\u201d\u201cHuh? To whom?\u201d\u201cJubelian.\u201dWhen the name fell from her lord\u2019s lips as she had expected, Fresia became deep in thought. \u201cIt will be difficult to invite Lady Floyen,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.Max frowned in response. \u201cWhy will it be difficult?\u201d he asked.Fresia smiled awkwardly. \u201cWell\u2026 Lady Floyen has become quite famous, so she\u2019ll be very busy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Unforeseen Aftermath\u2018My bed is the most comfortable place, after all.\u2019Other people might think that getting grounded was a punishment, but it was more like a reward for me. I rolled on my bed mindlessly for a while, then sighed when a gloomy thought occurred to me.\u00a0\u2018In any case, people are probably in an uproar because of the scene I caused at the banquet hall.\u2019I didn\u2019t need to go to another social event to know what people were saying about me.\u00a0\u2018They\u2019re probably talking about how I dramatically fainted at someone else\u2019s banquet and the strange gift I gave. Everyone must be criticizing me for being an attention seeker.\u2019\u00a0But as someone who disliked attending banquets and other public places that attracted unwanted gazes, I was far from that. I simply wanted to go home after quietly attending the banquet, knowing that my reputation would continue to tarnish if I stood out. However, the situation had been out of my control.\u2018Well, I should start thinking about what I can do.\u2019\u00a0In this situation, it would be a good idea to explain my point of view to other people, but I didn\u2019t even want to bother with that.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t people forget about what happened if I kept out of touch for a while?\u2019\u00a0It might also be a good idea to not meet anyone for a while, but that idea was soon discarded as well.\u00a0\u2018Doing that will be futile if my father decides to marry me off to the crown prince.\u2019As a headache started to form, someone knocked on my bedroom door.\u201cThis is Merilyn, my lady.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. Please come in.\u201dWhen I gave her my permission, she entered the room. I widened my eyes upon seeing the pile of letters on the silver tray she was holding.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026?\u201dMerilyn noticed my surprised expression and smiled gently. \u201cThese are all for you, my lady.\u201dI opened one of them cautiously, hoping that it wasn\u2019t an anonymous blackmail letter. Now that I was the prime subject of gossip, I was worried that people who held a grudge against me enclosed something dangerous, like a razor blade, inside. After checking the contents of the letter, I widened my eyes.\u2018An invitation?\u2019\u00a0I skimmed through the message, which started off with a greeting, then a request to attend a social event that the sender, the daughter of a noble household, was hosting. I checked the other letters just in case, and they likewise asked for my regards and expressed their wishes to invite me. All these letters were sent in the names of daughters from noble families.\u2018Ah, why is everyone suddenly doing this?\u2019\u00a0Although I harbored a suspicion, it simply didn\u2019t make sense for other girls to approach me using the same method as Rose had.\u00a0\u2018I really\u2026 hate this.\u2019\u00a0It was, to put it plainly, inconsiderate for them to send an invitation to someone who was rumored to be sick. In any case, I had no reason to attend another banquet after going through such trouble recently.\u2018If I decline their invitations without giving a reason, they might become hostile towards me. I should just say that I don\u2019t feel well.\u2019\u00a0It was a reasonable excuse because many people had witnessed my embarrassment leaving the banquet in my father\u2019s arms. I sighed when I picked up another letter and saw a familiar name.\u2018Rose\u2026?\u2019\u00a0It was from Rose Marie Arlo, the star of the birthday banquet where I caused a scene. I couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous when I saw the letter.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s only natural of her to be angry with me.\u2019\u00a0With this thought, I opened the letter and read its contents with a strange feeling.Dear Lady Floyen,How are you feeling? I was a little surprised when you left like that during the banquet because I didn\u2019t realize that you might still be feeling unwell. I sincerely apologize for not considering that beforehand. You have given me the best gift I have ever received in my life, but I only gave you an unpleasant memory in return.There are many more things I would like to say, but I will stop here because you are unwell. I hope that you will recover as soon as possible.It felt very strange to read a letter filled with concern from someone who I had expected the opposite from. I realized that it was my first time receiving such kindness while living as Jubelian.\u00a0\u2018If I consider the relationship between our families, it\u2019s natural for her to say these things for political reasons\u2026\u2019\u00a0Even so, I raised the corner of my lips unconsciously.\u2018I should review the remaining letters and think about how to respond.\u2019\u00a0With this thought, I picked up another envelope.\u2018Hm, Count Herend\u2026 Why do I feel like I\u2019ve heard this name before?\u2019\u00a0I thought about the list of noble families that Merilyn had given me, but I couldn\u2019t recall seeing such a name.\u00a0\u2018Well, I only memorized the households that have interacted with my family. It\u2019s only natural that I can\u2019t remember every member of the nobility.\u2019\u00a0This letter was another invitation. I furrowed my eyebrows slightly and stacked all the letters, except Rose\u2019s, before falling onto my bed.\u2018Well, now isn\u2019t the time to reply to these letters. I have to find a solution first, one that will discourage my father from making me meet with prospective marriage partners.\u2019* * *Max wandered restlessly, bearing an impatient expression. \u201cWhy on earth hasn\u2019t there a reply yet?\u201d he asked with an annoyed tone. \u201cYou must have sent an invitation.\u201dFresia sighed in response.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s only been two days since the letter was sent.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - The Crown Prince\u2019s TypeFresia was silently grumbling about her lord\u2019s lack of patience when Max spoke up again. \u201cYou mentioned that you struck a deal with Duke Floyen as a way to get information from him, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Fresia swallowed nervously because the details of this deal were supposed to be a secret that not even her lord should\u2019ve been aware of.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s something that he can benefit from as well\u2026 So it\u2019s better for him to not know.\u2019At that moment, Max said, \u201cGet in touch with him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry? There\u2019s nothing to report to him at this moment\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can make something up.\u201dFresia could guess her lord\u2019s true intentions from the words he said in an icy tone.\u00a0\u2018It seems like he\u2019s trying to drive the duke away from his home by using me as bait.\u2019* * *A week had already passed since I was forced to stay in my room.\u201cIt seems like you are well enough to take a walk outside, my lady,\u201d Allen said after lifting the detainment order on me.I smiled at his words and inadvertently stole a glance at the porcelain rabbit on my bedside table.\u00a0\u2018Father has probably proceeded with the preparations for my meeting with the crown prince.\u2019\u00a0I sighed. Despite my concentration these past few days, I hadn\u2019t been able to think of a way to avoid this meeting.\u2018It would be another story if I pretended to date someone my father approved of.\u2019\u00a0I didn\u2019t know anyone who he held in high regard, but perhaps Lord Frederick or Mikhail, the main character of this novel, were to his standards. Even so, someone like Lord Frederich, who was accomplished in all aspects of his life, would never take part in my scheme.\u2018That means my only solution is to follow the original novel and cling to Mikhail again\u2026 It seems like I\u2019ll die whether I date Mikhail or the crown prince.\u2019\u00a0I sighed out of resentment for my unfortunate circumstances when I heard a noise coming from the balcony, which was attached to my room.Tap, tap!I turned around, startled by the sound. Sure enough, a familiar face met me.\u00a0\u2018Father\u2019s disciple is here again.\u2019\u00a0I sighed again and walked towards the window.\u2018Why does this guy keep visiting me instead of my father? If someone sees us\u2026\u2019\u00a0At that moment, I suddenly thought about the scandalous rumors I once feared would arise from his visit.\u00a0\u2018Wait, that\u2019s it!\u2019I hurriedly ran towards the window and opened it. When I saw him, I smiled brightly and tightly grasped his hands. \u201cWelcome!\u201dAfter seeing my reaction, he hardened his expression. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked with a serious tone.Well, it didn\u2019t matter that his personality was a little vile. He was my only solution.My mouth widened into a smile. \u201cHey, do you want to\u2026\u201d* * *\u201cI can stall him for at most two hours. You must leave the mansion before then,\u201d Fresia had said.Max stared at the duke\u2019s mansion as he recalled her words.\u00a0\u2018Why isn\u2019t Jubelian coming outside?\u2019\u00a0He unconsciously clenched his teeth as he became overwhelmed by restlessness. When he finally saw a familiar shadow from afar, he raised the corner of his lips.\u2018She\u2019s finally moving.\u2019\u00a0Max crossed the garden, finding it easy to avoid the guards around the mansion. After arriving at the familiar ledge, he spotted her again.\u00a0\u2018Her ankle must be okay now, seeing as she\u2019s standing.\u2019He smiled unconsciously, finding himself captivated by the view. However, he soon came to his senses.\u00a0\u2018Why am I smiling like a fool? I should just tell her what I need to tell her before running out of time\u2026\u2019Max then realized that he had nothing to talk to Jubelian about and became absorbed in his thoughts.\u00a0\u2018This is driving me crazy.\u2019\u00a0He was disappointed in himself for doing things he didn\u2019t understand, but the urge to see the woman turn around and look at him was great enough to push him forward.Tap, tap.He hit the window with his fingers, prompting the woman to turn around. Her skin was a milky color, her hair radiated with light, her coral lips were slightly parted, and her periwinkle eyes contained mysteries; these very characteristics made up the face that had been troubling him these past few days.\u201cWhat a foolish expression,\u201d Max muttered to himself, trying to ignore the pounding of his heart. But the moment a broad smile appeared on her face, his efforts became futile.\u2018Even her foolish expression is pretty.\u2019\u00a0He continued to stare at her face as if he was possessed when the door that connected the balcony to her room opened.\u201cWelcome!\u201dMax\u2019s heart jumped when she greeted him and grabbed his hands with her smaller ones. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Max criticized, trying to suppress his emotions as much as possible. He was afraid of her knowing that he had been shaken up by her actions. When he saw her unfaltering smile, his heart began to pound harder.\u2018Why are you smiling even when I\u2019m being rude to you?\u2019\u00a0Max glared at Jubelian, wondering if she had ulterior motives for being so kind to him. Her coral-red lips parted.\u201cHey, do you want to go out with me?\u201dMax stared blankly at her, surprised by the words that came from her lips.\u00a0\u2018Go out? What is she saying?\u2019\u00a0When a thought suddenly occurred to him, he felt like he had been hit with a ton of bricks.\u00a0\u2018Is it possible that\u2026 she\u2019s been nice to me all this time because she likes me?\u2019Max had always detested people who approached him with hidden agendas, but at the thought of her doing so\u2026 he found it strangely acceptable. Now that he learned the reason behind her friendliness, he became relieved.\u00a0\u2018I see, that\u2019s why she said that.\u2019\u00a0He tried to control his expression and lower the corner of his lips, which kept trying to ascend into a smile.\u201cOh, in case you\u2019re mistaken, I don\u2019t like you. I just want a contractual relationship, so could you please stop frowning?\u201dMax ruthlessly twisted his expression in response.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - The Crown Prince\u2019s TypePitch black hair and eyes that glittered like red jewels. The handsome man who possessed a perfectly symmetrical face was frowning at me.\u00a0\u2018I swear he could\u2019ve been the main character if appearance was the only criteria\u2026\u2019This man was my father\u2019s disciple, so there was no doubt that he was a skillful swordsman and someone who my father approved of. He was the best person to act like my boyfriend in front of him.\u00a0\u2018It would be nice if he could cooperate with me without making a fuss\u2026\u2019His eyes glittered with bloodlust. \u201cContractual relationship? What do you mean by that?\u201d\u2018Wow, it seems like he\u2019s really angry. He was expressionless just a moment ago, so I must\u2019ve really irritated him.\u2019\u00a0I mulled over my words, thinking about what might have affected him so much, and quickly found the answer.\u00a0\u2018Right. Now that I think about it, I didn\u2019t mention the benefits that will come with my offer.\u2019\u00a0I heard that mercenaries were sensitive about the conditions concerning their jobs. If I offered something that he wasn\u2019t satisfied with, he might refuse and immediately leave the mansion.\u201cIn exchange for dating me, I\u2019ll give you all the money you want.\u201d His eyes became fiercer when I finished speaking, so I added another condition. \u201cOf course, it will only be for a limited time, so you don\u2019t need to worry. You just have to date me until I become independent and leave this place.\u201dHe relaxed his expression and sighed. \u201cWhy are you trying to leave this place? Wouldn\u2019t that be the start to a difficult life?\u201dIn response to his simplistic thoughts, I smiled bitterly and said, \u201cRemember when I told you that my father made a prospective marriage list for me?\u201d When he nodded slowly, I snickered. \u201cThe problem is, my father already decided who I will be married to.\u201d\u201cIf you really dislike that person, can\u2019t you just refuse him?\u201d\u201cWell, he\u2019s someone who I won\u2019t be able to refuse even if I tried.\u201dHe glared at me coldly. \u201cWho is it that even you, the daughter of the duke, can\u2019t refuse?\u201d he asked in a low voice. It was the same tone he used when he asked me if anyone harassed me at the banquet. A burst of strange laughter bubbled from my lips.\u2018Well, he probably thinks I\u2019m not being smart in this situation.\u2019\u00a0It was reasonable for me to become angry about my predicament like he was, but funnily enough, I wasn\u2019t even upset anymore.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d He looked at me with blatant disapproval, as if he thought I was laughing at him.\u201cAh, I just\u2026 happened to laugh.\u201dWhen I evaded his question, he scrunched his face even more. \u201cSo, who is this person?\u201dI noticed this about him a while ago, but he was a really persistent person.\u00a0\u2018The point is that I\u2019m about to be forced into an arranged marriage. The identity of that person isn\u2019t important.\u2019\u00a0But given his tenacious personality, he would probably be in a bad mood if I evaded his question. I had no choice but to answer him.\u201cHey, you can\u2019t tell this to anyone else. If they find out, I\u2019ll be in big trouble.\u201d\u201cWhat type of person do you think I am? Just tell me already.\u201dI hesitated for a while. \u201cMaximillian Casein Assiette,\u201d I finally said.\u201cA trivial person like that\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cThe crown prince of this empire.\u201dHe looked at me with surprise. \u201cThe crown prince is your prospective marriage partner?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said.\u201dHe became silent for a while, then said in a quiet voice, \u201cThat\u2019s weird, there\u2019s no way\u2026\u201dThere was doubt in his hesitant voice.\u00a0\u2018Well, he\u2019s someone who once insisted on speaking to me informally, so he\u2019s probably not very knowledgeable about worldly affairs.\u2019\u00a0I decided to be generous and explain the situation to this insensible man.\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018weird?\u2019 Despite my unruly appearance, I\u2019m still the daughter of a duke. In terms of status, my family is only second to the imperial family. Although my social reputation is a mess, it won\u2019t be a loss for the crown prince and his family to have the duke as a relative.\u201dWhen I finished giving this long explanation, he chuckled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dI wondered if he actually understood me, but I continued to explain for now. \u201cThat\u2019s why I won\u2019t be able to refuse the crown prince as my prospective marriage partner.\u201dA long time ago, a great archmage by the name of Assiette established the Assiette empire. It is said that as a great lord and king, he used magic to solve his people\u2019s problems. As such, Assiette\u2019s descendants were revered as gods. Perhaps this was the reason why my father\u2019s disciple possessed an extremely stiff expression.\u201cFor this reason, I\u2019m planning to show my father that I\u2019m dating someone else before he even brings up the crown prince. He will be unable to force this union if his daughter is involved in a scandal with another man.\u201dAt that moment, my father\u2019s disciple parted his lips. \u201cWhat are you planning to do if the crown prince says he doesn\u2019t mind?\u201dGoosebumps rose on my skin as soon as I heard his dreadful supposition, but I tried my best to not show my fear. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. The imperial family must be crazy if they approve of a woman who\u2019s already dating someone else\u2026\u201dI trailed off because I was bothered by his change in expression.\u00a0\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019\u00a0He had frowned at the word \u2018crazy.\u2019At that moment, he said, \u201cYou might suit the crown prince\u2019s taste.\u201d\u2018I might suit the crown prince\u2019s taste?\u2019\u00a0A shiver ran up my spine in response.\u00a0\u2018I knew it. It was unusual that he deliberately came down to the Room of Shadows to torture me in the first place.\u2019\u00a0If I was really the crown prince\u2019s type, it would be difficult to escape from him because madmen obtained joy out of killing and harassing other people for no reason. I shuddered from these horrible thoughts and quickly calmed myself.\u201cThen I must run away,\u201d I said.As soon as I said that, his expression froze over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Delusions\u2018Ugh, why is he making that face now? Could he be undergoing puberty at this late age?\u2019\u00a0I couldn\u2019t help but speculate this because of his severe mood swings.At that moment, he said in a low voice, \u201cRun away, huh? Doing that will only make your life difficult though.\u201dI nodded in response. \u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll be much happier being penniless than if I were to marry the crown prince.\u201dAlthough I would have to sacrifice my inheritance from my father, I could sell my jewelry for a good chunk of money.\u00a0\u2018Even without my inheritance, I\u2019ll be able to sustain myself by running a small business.\u2019\u00a0Although this meant giving up my dream of living lavishly without having to lift a finger, running away was the only adequate solution I could think of.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s probably a good idea to start preparing.\u2019At that moment, I heard a quiet voice. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026!\u201d I called out to him, but he had already left without hearing what I had to say. When I came to terms with his departure, I sighed. \u201c\u2026You should\u2019ve at least told me if you were going to accept or reject my request.\u201d* * *Fresia quietly watched Duke Floyen as he reviewed the documents she had given to him.\u00a0\u2018For God\u2019s sake, I hope he doesn\u2019t notice anything\u2026\u2019\u00a0Her back had become clammy from cold sweats. She had only managed to stall him for an hour, which was already an achievement.It was then Regis closed the folder. \u201cI\u2019ve looked through the documents you gave me, but I don\u2019t see anything different from last time.\u201dAs the duke was about to stand up and leave, Fresia calmly said, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. If you look carefully\u2026\u201d\u201cYulia.\u201dShe hardened her expression when the duke called out her real name. She knew that he only did this when he was about to threaten her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your purpose is, but if you pull something like this again, I\u2019ll call off the deal.\u201d Regis stood up after warning her.She glanced at the duke. \u201cI have more information though. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to see them?\u201d she asked.In response, the man who had worn a hostile expression just a minute ago sat back down meekly. A smile spread across Fresia\u2019s face.\u00a0\u2018His reaction makes me wonder what kind of person Lady Floyen is. She\u2019s managed to make my lord and this scary person so obedient.\u2019\u201cSo, what is it that you want to show me?\u201dFresia took out another folder. \u201cThis.\u201d\u2018I planned to disclose this information later, but it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019\u00a0Fresia decided to show Regis the last card up her sleeve.A murderous aura emanated from Regis\u2019s eyes as he reviewed the document. \u201cIs this true?\u201dFresia nodded and sipped her tea instead of responding immediately. When the tea passed through her throat, she set down the cup and smiled sweetly. \u201cHave you ever seen me make a mistake?\u201dRegis hardened his expression and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dFresia looked at the duke\u2019s retreating back, then at the clock.\u00a0\u2018Hm, it\u2019s a little earlier than what I had promised my lord\u2026 but he\u2019ll probably be able to take care of it.\u2019\u00a0She picked up her cup again to drink the remaining tea that had gone cold before forcefully setting it back on the plate.* * *Clang!\u00a0A rough, bursting sound rang throughout the room.\u2018What is that woman planning?\u2019\u00a0Mikhail looked at the broken pieces of the liquor bottle he had smashed and twisted his expression.\u00a0\u2018Why on earth is she ignoring me?!\u2019\u00a0He had sent an invitation to her, bothered by the fact she had left in the duke\u2019s arms, but she hadn\u2019t even replied.\u2018Just what is her reason? I even apologized this time\u2026\u2019\u00a0Mikhail had always been treated like a genius, so this was his first time lowering himself to someone else. When his apology didn\u2019t even produce a response, it was a hard hit to his pride.\u00a0\u2018D*mn it. What exactly went wrong?\u2019\u00a0Although he had apologized and tried to get in touch with her, she wasn\u2019t sparing him another glance. He was the one actively seeking her out now.\u2018A woman like that\u2026 I should act as if she doesn\u2019t exist either.\u2019\u00a0He tried to stop thinking about her with this in mind, but he suddenly became dizzy from the bitter scent of liquor.\u201cI like you, Mikhail,\u201d\u00a0she once said.Perhaps it was because he was drunk, but this terrible memory clouded his thoughts. Mikhail clenched his fists and punched the wall.* * *Bang!Max returned to his hideout and slammed the door angrily. Fresia, who had been startled by the sound, calmed herself and glared at Max.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s back earlier than expected, but why does he look so glum?\u2019When Max sat on the couch with a furious expression, Fresia furtively glanced at him. \u201cDid something go wrong?\u201d she asked.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Max said coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - DelusionsFresia frowned.\u00a0\u2018Some personality he has. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t even bother to correct all the bad rumors about him among the nobles.\u2019\u00a0As she silently complained to herself, she heard a soft voice.\u201cWhat does it mean when a woman says she wants to run away from her marriage partner?\u201dFresia became deep in thought for a while, then smiled \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? She must hate that person with a passion.\u201dMax scrunched his face at the expected answer and clenched his fists.\u00a0\u2018She hates me with a passion?\u2019\u201cSo what happened at the mansion that is making you so angry?\u201d Fresia asked softly.Max furrowed his eyebrows and began to reproach her cold-heartedly. \u201cI said it was none of your\u2026\u201d\u201cBy any chance, did you propose to the lady? And if so, did she say that she wanted to run away from you, my lord?\u201dMax felt his face getting hot in response. \u201cWho proposed?! It was her who\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, do you want to go out with me?\u201d\u00a0she had said.Unable to continue, Max changed the subject instead. \u201cIs there any news from the emperor?\u201d\u201cOh, you know. He\u2019s doing the same old, rushing for your return and\u2026 Ah.\u201d Fresia\u2019s expression became serious. \u201cRather than the emperor causing trouble, the empress sent another assassin. I told our men to keep him alive for now.\u201dMax smirked. \u201cReally?\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time his spiteful stepmother, the current empress, had tried to kill him. He suspected that she had also killed the former empress, his birth mother. For these reasons, Max harbored a deep hatred for her.\u00a0\u2018It would be a good idea to behead the assassin and send it back to that woman as a gift.\u2019\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s\u2026\u201d Just as he was about to reveal this gruesome thought, someone came to mind.\u201cThen I must run away,\u201d\u00a0Jubelian had said.Max squeezed his fists and closed his mouth tightly.\u201cWhat should we do about him?\u201d Fresia asked.\u201cKeep him alive,\u201d Max said softly.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d With this, Fresia began to head out of the room.\u201cAh, I\u2019m also asking this out of curiosity\u2026 but has there been an invitation for me to meet a prospective marriage partner?\u201d Max\u2019s quiet voice stopped her at that moment.Fresia smiled slightly in response. \u201cIf there was such a thing, I would\u2019ve let you know immediately, Your Highness. But why are you asking something like this all of a sudden?\u201dInstead of answering her, Max waved at her dismissively.\u00a0\u2018Seriously, would it hurt for him to answer me right away?\u2019\u00a0Fresia thought. When she left the room, Max frowned and recalled what he had said to his master in the past.\u201cI don\u2019t intend to create a weakness like that.\u201dHe had never hesitated to dye his hands with red before, but strangely enough, he didn\u2019t want to today.\u00a0\u2018Why do I\u2026 suddenly feel regretful?\u2019\u00a0Max clenched his fists.* * *Every time I dined with my father, I felt as if I was walking on thin ice. I was constantly occupied by the anxiety that he might mention my prospective marriage partner.\u00a0\u2018Ah, I really shouldn\u2019t have let his disciple leave so easily that day.\u2019\u00a0When I sighed mournfully, my father called out to me.\u201cJubelian.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d I asked calmly. Although I tried to look calm, I was nervous that he was going to start talking about the marriage meeting.\u2018Please do not talk about it. Anything but that,\u2019\u00a0I prayed to myself.\u201cWhat do you think about the crown prince?\u201dWhen I realized that I had to confront the very thing that had been troubling me, I could only turn to God.\u00a0\u2018Dear God, why are you doing this to me?\u2019\u00a0If I could avoid answering my father\u2019s question forever, I would. But if I kept tight-lipped, he would think I was acting strangely. I hesitated for a moment before deciding to beat around the bush.\u201cHm, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t really think about him.\u201dWhen I responded like a naive noblewoman, my father slightly furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cI see,\u201d he muttered before picking up his spoon again. Just as I was about to be relieved, he said, \u201cStill, you should learn about him.\u201dChills ran down my spine.\u00a0\u2018You want me to learn about a sadist who might kill me? No thank you.\u2019Contrary to my thoughts, I smiled shyly and changed the topic. \u201cWell, I have been reading a lot recently. It\u2019s made me realize that history is an exciting subject.\u201d I was trying to show him that I was doing my best to live my life to the fullest instead of being a good-for-nothing. My father took my bait.\u201cI see. What have you been reading?\u201d\u201cAh, the history of this empire\u2019s foundation.\u201dHis face slightly hardened at my words. \u201cI see,\u201d he said.I became concerned that he might mention the marriage meeting again, so I continued talking. \u201cThe most interesting part of the book is about the first emperor.\u201d I actually thought that the treasures left by him were the most interesting part, but they were both in the same context. \u201cI learned that he left behind many peculiar things\u2026 Do you think they are still being passed down?\u201dMy father set down his spoon. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said before standing up from his chair. \u201cI just remembered an urgent business that I have to take care of. You can take your time.\u201dI was a bit taken aback because my father was never the first one to leave the dining room when we shared our meals.\u00a0\u2018Hm, what\u2019s so urgent?\u2019\u00a0Although I felt relieved, on one hand, I felt empty on the other.* * *Regis sighed after returning to his room, worried that Jubelian might find his actions a bit strange.\u00a0\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said that\u2026\u2019\u00a0After feeling regretful for a while, he thought about what she said earlier.\u201cHm, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t really think about him.\u201dAlthough she was insensitive to rumors, it was impossible that Jubelian didn\u2019t know about the bad rumors involving the crown prince. However, his daughter bore a stern expression, as if she didn\u2019t want to think about the prince\u2019s unpleasant qualities.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s also suspicious that she\u2019s reading about the imperial family.\u2019Regis looked at the cufflinks his daughter had given him as a gift and sighed.\u00a0\u2018I must stop them from getting together.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Preparations for a Tea Tasting PartyWhen I went back to my room after finishing my meal, I saw Sella arranging the flowers in a vase. The assortment of pink and white roses looked quite pleasant.\u00a0\u2018Now that I think about it, we don\u2019t have many of them around here.\u2019\u00a0I stared at the flowers blankly until a voice pulled me out of my reverie.\u201cMy lady.\u201dI turned around and saw Merilyn holding a silver tray. \u201cIt seems like I\u2019ve received more letters.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d she said. I felt like a heavy burden had been lifted off of me when I heard her warm voice. We had become close recently, so she no longer acted uncomfortably around me.\u2018Well, receiving more letters isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u2019\u00a0When I opened one of them, I recognized the sender\u2019s familiar handwriting.Dear Lady Floyen,How have you been these days? You haven\u2019t mentioned anything about your health recently, so I assume you\u2019ve fully recovered. Even so, I\u2019m worried about you. I hope you don\u2019t feel sick anymore and continue to stay healthy from now on.By the way, I have been attending tea tasting parties recently. Since it involves surrounding oneself with like-minded people, I believe it\u2019s a befitting way to peacefully enjoy tea without feeling burdened or uncomfortable. If you have any interest in joining us, please let me know.\u2018If I reject her when she\u2019s making an effort to invite me\u2026 I will end up becoming isolated.\u2019\u00a0In the event I had to run away from home, it would be best to receive sympathy from other people by becoming more social.\u00a0\u2018I should also learn more about the crown prince, as my father suggested, and get to know his dislikes.\u2019\u201cCan you please run an errand to Count Arlo\u2019s residence?\u201d I asked Merilyn, setting down the letter.She nodded in response. \u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d* * *\u201cLady Floyen has fully recovered from her illness!\u201d\u201cOh my, that\u2019s great news.\u201dMembers of the tea tasting circle were delighted to hear that Lady Floyen had overcome her indisposition. Rose, who had just shared the news, smiled sweetly. \u201cShe also said that she\u2019s interested in joining our next meeting. What does everyone think?\u201d\u201cOh my goodness, that would be amazing!\u201d\u201cOf course she can!\u201dWhile everyone shouted in joy, there was one person who remained silent. Rose looked at her and said, \u201cThe next tea party will be at your place, Veronica. You\u2019re okay with that, right?\u201dWhen she was addressed, the woman who maintained a dissatisfied expression spoke halfheartedly. \u201cSure, she can be invited.\u201d Although she tried to seem excited, her hand trembled as she picked up a sugar cube with a pair of tongs.\u00a0\u2018So that woman is coming to my house.\u2019Unaware of Veronica\u2019s thoughts, Rose became giddy. \u201cYay! I\u2019m so excited that I\u2019ll let the lady know as soon as possible!\u201d she exclaimed with rosy cheeks.* * *\u201cThe hostess of the tea party usually has the privilege to invite people, but Lady Arlo invited a personal acquaintance to the group at her own discretion!\u201d Veronica gritted her teeth as she recalled what happened earlier.The person who was listening to her sighed. \u201cLady Veronica,\u201d he said. Although he spoke with a cold and lofty tone, that was considered his charm.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very tired right now\u2026\u201dIt seemed like he was commanding her to leave, so Veronica quickly mentioned a certain someone he disliked to grab his attention. \u201cAh, that personal acquaintance was Lady Floyen. Can you believe it? Isn\u2019t it pure nonsense? I know social status is of importance, but how could she invite such a selfish woman like her\u2026!\u201dThe man\u2019s indifferent eyes glimmered in response. \u201cDid you say you\u2019re hosting the next tea party?\u201d\u201cAh, yes I am.\u201d\u201cCould you invite me as well? I\u2019m worried about you now that Lady Floyen is attending.\u201dIf she had been facing anyone else, Veronica would\u2019ve suspected his misleading words, but her everlasting, unrequited love for this man prevented her from thinking clearly.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s worried about me!\u2019\u00a0His brief attention on her made Veronica so happy that she ended up nodding brightly. \u201cOf course, Sir Mikhail!\u201dThe corner of Mikhail\u2019s lips slowly raised in response.\u00a0\u2018We\u2019ll finally meet again, Jubelian.\u2019* * *I went into my dressing room to browse my clothes and let out a sigh.\u00a0\u2018Hm, I haven\u2019t shopped for any accessories or clothes in a while.\u2019\u00a0Although I had appropriate dresses for going out and attending the banquet, I needed something that would suit this occasion, as tea parties were casual meetings that required little formality.\u00a0\u2018I want to wear a different style as well\u2026\u2019\u00a0As I was debating whether I should go shopping or look through the catalog of a famous boutique, Merilyn approached me with a wrapped box.\u201cIt\u2019s a gift from Fyodor\u2019s Workshop, my lady.\u201dAfter accepting the box and opening it, I became confused when I saw what was inside.\u00a0\u2018Wait, this is\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - Preparations for a Tea Tasting PartyThe brooch was decorated with aquamarine gemstones and set with platinum. I could tell it was expensive just by looking at it.\u00a0\u2018He couldn\u2019t have possibly sent it to me for free\u2026\u2019\u00a0I opened up the accompanying letter, which went as follows:Dear Lady Floyen, I am sending this gift in order to celebrate your recovery. I hope you like it, my lady. It is thanks to your benevolence that the workshop is booming, after all.Although it\u2019s not much, I would like to send you a gift every month as a token of my appreciation. Please accept them without restraint, as I do not expect anything in return. It would also be an honor if you visited my workshop whenever you can, my muse.The letter was lengthy, but it was essentially thanking me for promoting his work.\u00a0\u2018If I think about it, I did somewhat advertise his workshop\u2026 it should be okay to accept this.\u2019\u00a0Thanks to him, I didn\u2019t have to worry about my lack of accessories anymore.\u00a0\u2018Although I don\u2019t plan on selling his gifts\u2026 I can use them as an emergency fund in the worst-case scenario.\u2019\u00a0After silently thanking Fyodor for this useful gift, I turned to Merilyn. \u201cI plan to visit Arcade Street. Please make preparations.\u201d* * *\u201cThe lady is getting ready to go out, Master. She says it\u2019s been a while since she went shopping.\u201dRegis sighed in response. \u201cWho are the escorts?\u201d he asked.Derrick listed the most skillful knights from the Floyen household. \u201cSir Geraldine, Sir Todd, Sir Dylan, Sir Howard, and Sir Ronald. There are five escorts in total.\u201dRegis nodded with a satisfied expression. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s sufficient.\u201d\u201cA messenger from Madam is also here. She says there is urgent news you must be informed about.\u201dAlthough she seemed carefree on the outside, Fresia was inherently cautious and rarely summoned him for trivial things. Regis sighed.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s probably not pulling my leg like she did last time\u2026 I should go.\u2019* * *\u201cDo you have plans for today, Your Highness?\u201dMax scrunched his face at Fresia, who was hinting at him to leave. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cA guest is coming.\u201dMax felt his temper rise and noticeably expressed his displeasure. \u201cIf it\u2019s a guest, use another room here.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 the problem is\u2026 the guest is Duke Floyen.\u201dMax twisted his expression in response. \u201cSo? Are you telling me that I should run away from this place to intentionally avoid him?\u201d Max had always maintained a semblance of politeness towards the duke because he was his master, but it seemed like he was severely enraged now, as indicated by his extremely perverse behavior.\u2018I know he\u2019s my lord\u2026 but he\u2019s so difficult to deal with.\u2019\u00a0Fresia silently groaned and said, \u201cWe will be discussing an important issue this time, so I think it will take a while.\u201d\u201cWhat issue would take this long?\u201d Max retorted.Fresia sighed softly.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s not something I can tell him\u2026 What should I do?\u2019\u00a0She didn\u2019t dwell on this question for much longer, however, because of her experience in assisting Max. She decided to tell him a piece of information she had planned to give the duke as part of their deal. \u201cI heard Lady Floyen will be attending a small tea party held by some noblewomen. Sir Mikhail, of all people, will be attending the party as well.\u201dMax widened his eyes in response, then narrowed them severely. \u201cWhat? Why him?\u201d\u2018It used to be difficult to recognize his emotions in the past because he was always expressionless, but he\u2019s become a lot more transparent these days.\u2019\u00a0Fresia tried her best to suppress her laughter and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know; that\u2019s something only he would know. But if he\u2019s attending an occasion to see his ex-lover, doesn\u2019t it seem like he has regrets?\u201dMax glared at Fresia. His expression was fierce, but it was quite different from the face he made when he was angry. Fresia knew what the subtle difference was.\u00a0\u2018Jealousy, it seems. I never thought my lord would ever make a face like that.\u2019\u00a0Not long ago, he had been an unfeeling man who didn\u2019t hesitate to ruthlessly kill his enemies. Although he was a rather generous person to his allies, he was incredibly cruel and merciless toward his enemies, so much so that it even frightened Fresia sometimes. However, he seemed to have changed at a certain point.\u201cKeep him alive,\u201d\u00a0he said last time. Fresia couldn\u2019t tell yet if these changes were going to benefit or harm him, but she didn\u2019t mind them. In the past, her lord seemed to be turning more into a monster, like the emperor, but now she could sense a faint trace of humanity from him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you to hurry up and go\u2026\u201d Fresia trailed off upon seeing that Max had already disappeared and clicked her tongue. \u201cThat was fast. How energetic of him.\u201d\u201cThe guest has arrived, Madam.\u201dFresia hardened her expression and arose at the sound of someone knocking on the door.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s time to work.\u2019* * *Max felt his blood boil and his head getting hot. Back when he was ridiculously weak, he could only survive by deceiving his father and stepmother. This made him good at suppressing his anger, a skill which he maintained even when he had grown in strength. However, this emotion, which he had always been able to restrain, was out of control because of a single fact.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s meeting with him again?\u2019After his mother died, Max decided to tread the path of becoming emperor and pledged to never be swayed by something as trivial as emotions, to not ruin his plans. He had abided by this since he was young, but now he was feeling the very things he had desperately tried to avoid. Even so, he couldn\u2019t help but visit her.\u201cIt gets cold at night because we\u2019re in-between seasons.\u201d\u201cI was worried because I have strange preferences for food, but I\u2019m glad you like it as well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for free. Just help me when I need it.\u201dAs he recalled the words she had said, Max felt her poisonous presence take effect. Even so, he found himself unable to escape because she was just that addictive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Reunited at Arcade StreetMax ran as if he was being chased by his thoughts and arrived at Jubelian\u2019s house in no time. He would usually check if his master was inside first, but he was too focused on simply making it to her room today. When he arrived at the balcony, Max realized that no one was in there.\u2018Where did she go?\u2019\u00a0As he frantically peered into the room and searched for Jubelian\u2019s presence, he sensed someone getting closer.\u00a0\u2018Who is that?\u2019\u00a0The person\u2019s heavy gait felt different from her light, feather-like footsteps. Just as the bedroom door was about to open, Max hid himself.\u201cWhat kind of dress will our lady choose this time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I think she will look nice in a flowy dress with frills.\u201d\u201cSince she\u2019s so beautiful, what wouldn\u2019t suit her?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m jealous that I can\u2019t shop at Arcade Street without any worries as well.\u201dMax could guess Jubelian\u2019s location from the maids\u2019 conversation.\u00a0\u2018Arcade Street\u2026 huh.\u2019* * *I closed my eyes from intense fatigue, then reopened them. Just a few months ago, I had at least exercised by following Mikhail around, but now my stamina had deteriorated from staying at home all the time.\u00a0\u2018I shouldn\u2019t forget to take regular walks from now on, at the very least.\u2019\u00a0With this in mind, I entered a renowned boutique in the capital.\u201cOh my, what a surprise!\u201d Although I heard the person who spoke, I didn\u2019t think it was directed towards me until she blocked my path. \u201cHave you come out to shop as well, Lady Floyen?\u201d\u2018Hmm\u2026 No matter how much I look at her, I can\u2019t figure out her identity,\u2019\u00a0I thought as I studied her face closely.\u00a0Nevertheless, I decided to respond to her as if I knew her, or else she might naturally get offended at me for not recognizing her. \u201cYes, are you looking for dresses as well?\u201d\u201cOh, Lady Floyen! There\u2019s no other reason to visit a seamstress than that. Well, I\u2019m actually here to take my finished dress home.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. Then if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d I excused myself, preparing to walk past her to continue my shopping.\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame,\u201d she suddenly said with a sigh. I imperceptibly turned toward her and saw that she was looking straight at me, which meant that she had aimed her words at me.\u201cHuh? What is?\u201dIn response to my question, she spoke as if she had waited for me to ask. \u201cI just think these dresses won\u2019t suit you well because of your slender figure, Lady Floyen. If trends weren\u2019t so important, you wouldn\u2019t have to wear uncomfortable dresses that don\u2019t even look good on you. It\u2019s simply\u2026 a shame.\u201dHer words sounded sarcastic, but there was some truth to them.\u00a0\u2018They are definitely uncomfortable.\u2019\u00a0The trend these days was the robe \u00e1 la fran\u00e7aise, as seen in the show \u2018Rose of Versailles.\u2019 With its showy stomacher and sizable skirt, this dress attracted attention to the bust. Although it was pretty, it was extremely uncomfortable. I had originally planned to order a dress to follow the trend, but I was reminded to take my comfort into consideration if I was going through the hassle of requesting a dress in the first place.\u00a0\u2018Thanks to her, I\u2019ve realized something important.\u2019Regardless of her intentions, I was grateful that she offered me useful advice. \u201cThank you for the advice. I will take it into consideration and order a dress that suits me,\u201d I said with a smile.She showed a reluctant expression in response and nodded. \u201cAh, okay.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll excuse myself.\u201d As I strode past her, I thought about what kind of dress I was going to request to the designer before coming up with an idea.\u00a0\u2018Ah, that should be good.\u2019* * *I was exhausted by the time I finished ordering the dress, but it was a worthwhile endeavor.\u00a0\u2018I think the new dress will suit me better.\u2019\u00a0Now that I had completed what I had set out to do for the day, I became overwhelmed with fatigue. As I contemplated whether I should go back home, I heard someone\u2019s voice.\u201cYou scoundrel! Are you trying to avoid responsibility after putting a nobleman in danger? Apologize at this moment!\u201dI frowned, wondering who would harass a commoner at a public place like this.\u00a0\u2018He sounds like an idiot trying to recover his self-esteem by humiliating someone else.\u2019\u00a0I cast a furtive glance at the dispute, then knit my eyebrows.\u00a0\u2018Why\u2026 is he here?\u2019The nobleman who was mistreating the commoner was a famous man even I knew of. His name was Baron Gordon, and he had once been the subject of gossip among the nobility as a commoner who managed to enter the upper class.\u00a0\u2018Infamous, to be precise.\u2019\u00a0As a former usurer, he had acquired the favor of high-ranking nobles by buying them expensive gifts. He must\u2019ve thought he could buy anything, even status, with money. But it was impossible for the nobility, the very class that depended on the principle of blood rights, to easily accept him as their kind. Eventually, he vanished from high society after being cast away.\u00a0\u2018I was wondering why I hadn\u2019t heard any news about him for a while. It looks like he was busy running around and doing things like this.\u2019\u00a0My thoughts were directed towards the commoner rather than Baron Gordon, however.\u201cI don\u2019t know why I have to apologize when you\u2019re the one at fault for falling.\u201dThere was only one person I knew who would informally talk to a nobleman like that.\u00a0\u2018I knew it. I knew that he wasn\u2019t going to keep his promise.\u2019\u00a0I sighed and glared at my father\u2019s disciple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Reunited at Arcade Street [V1 End]Max naturally disliked busy places because it reminded him of the battlefield, the only other place he had been to that had been this crowded. For this reason, he felt lost when he entered the unfamiliar Arcade Street. A wandering musician played an instrument in front of the fountain at the center of the plaza, surrounded by onlookers. Lines of people stood outside renowned shops. A wide range of people traversed Arcade Streets, moving in groups as family, friends, or lovers.\u2018How tiring.\u2019\u00a0The peaceful atmosphere made Max even tenser. He felt like an outsider in this strange place.\u00a0\u2018Where on earth is Jubelian?\u2019\u00a0He was constantly moving around, trying to look for her. Just as a man was about to bump shoulders with him, Max swiftly evaded the collision.\u201cAgh! Darn it!\u201d The man who ended up falling by himself shouted angrily and glared at him. \u201cHow dare you!\u201dMax frowned at the man\u2019s bizarre and excessively loud voice.\u00a0\u2018What is this thing?\u2019\u00a0he wondered. He never avoided people who tried to start fights with him, but his top priority right now was to find Jubelian. Max ignored the man and tried to leave, but a group of young men who looked like escorts suddenly appeared and surrounded him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, my lord?\u201d they asked the man who fell.\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going after offending a nobleman?\u201d the man yelled fiercely as his escorts helped him get up.Max scowled at his unpleasant words. \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d he countered.\u201cThat thing you just did, you rascal! Didn\u2019t you just trip me?\u201dMax unconsciously raised the corner of his lips, feeling a murderous urge rise inside of him when he realized that the man was trying to pick a fight.\u00a0\u2018Should I just kill him?\u2019\u00a0Max silently clenched his fists, then unclenched them. The escorts who surrounded him had big figures, but they were nothing compared to him. If he decided to fight back, he could guarantee complete victory. But if he dirtied his hands over this trivial matter, it would delay his search for the woman.\u201cThis has nothing to do with me.\u201d Max once again tried to leave after speaking as nicely as possible, but the other man continued to rave with fury, unwilling to let him go unpunished.\u201cYou scoundrel! Are you trying to avoid responsibility after putting a nobleman in danger? Apologize at this moment!\u201dMax truly wanted to put this man in danger as he said, but he suppressed this impulse. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I have to apologize when you\u2019re the one at fault for falling.\u201dThe baron gritted his teeth in response.\u00a0\u2018How dare he, a commoner\u2026 look down on me!\u2019\u00a0As a nobleman who had been born from the lower class, Baron Gordon was disdained in high society for his origins. For this reason, he had been miserable for quite some time. No matter how much support he won using money, there seemed to be no end to his suffering. Then one day, he witnessed an unpleasant scene while he was in an extremely foul mood.\u201cOh my goodness, what is your name?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you work for us? I\u2019ll pay you plenty.\u201dA group of noblewomen who usually ignored him was fawning over a good-looking servant.\u00a0\u2018Disgusting.\u2019\u00a0He was so irritated by what he had seen that he ended up summoning the servant and picking a fight with him. He received an apology in response:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making a foolish mistake. Please be generous and forgive me.\u201dIt was truly a great spectacle when this good-for-nothing, who had been overconfident in front of a group of noblewomen just a minute ago, begged for mercy and kneeled on the ground like a dog. He felt as if he could fly.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m the nobleman here.\u2019\u00a0It was only when he reassured himself of this did he relax. After that day, he bullied tall and attractive commoners to release his anger. But unlike his other victims, who easily apologized, Max continued to be stubborn to the end, making him sink into his violent tendencies again.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t let go of a bugger like him!\u2019\u201cWhat are you doing? Tie up that arrogant commoner!\u201d the baron burst out, his voice filled with anger. The young men surrounding Max advanced at his orders, but a voice soon made them pause.\u201cStop that right now.\u201d The voice was gentle and sweet, but it was also cold and laced with dignity. Everyone ceased what they were doing to look at the woman who spoke.\u201cY-you are\u2026!\u201dThere stood an elegant woman with silver hair, periwinkle eyes, and alluring features that dazzled the eye. One could immediately sense that this gorgeous woman, who bore a frosty expression, was of the upper nobility. Although Baron Gordon was deserted by aristocratic society, he wasn\u2019t so dull as to not recognize the woman who outranked most of high society.\u201cI greet the lady of the great House of Floyen. I am\u2026\u201dThe woman listened to the baron\u2019s greetings and slightly nodded before opening her mouth. \u201cI know who you are, Baron Gordon.\u201d Although she had spoken in an icy tone, Baron Gordon was delighted that Lady Floyen had recognized a low-ranking nobleman like him.\u201cTo meet the lady like this by coincidence, I am truly a lucky person.\u201dThe children of dukes were usually treated as if they possessed the ranks of a count or countess. It was rare for a baron to even be able to strike a conversation with someone like her.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s rather notorious, but what does that matter?\u2019\u00a0If he could win the favor of the lady and eventually become noticed by the duke, the baron thought that it was worth using all the money he had.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s very easy to please a young girl.\u2019\u00a0Baron Gordon\u2019s eyes shined at the lady when her red lips parted.\u201cReally? Because I\u2019m very annoyed right now.\u201dThe baron flinched at her frigid voice, which didn\u2019t even contain a hint of warmth.<To Be Continued in Book 2>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - My Secret EscortAct 7. I Will Protect You\u201cI\u2019m sorry? D-did I by any chance\u2026 offend you, my lady?\u201d Baron Gordon stuttered as if he was taken aback. But rather than sympathy, I felt anger rise inside me.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s harsh towards the powerless but has the audacity to act pitifully in front of me.\u2019Baron Gordon reminded me of my superiors in my past life, who frequently abused their authority. People like them only acted servile towards the powerful but freely raised their voices towards the weak. Although I wanted to berate him to my heart\u2019s content, I was aware that we were in the middle of Arcade Street, where many nobles milled around. I was bound to become the subject of more rumors if I blindly supported my father\u2019s disciple, who seemed like a commoner.\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no way around this but to put on a little act.\u2019I pointed at my father\u2019s disciple and straightened my expression. \u201cWeren\u2019t you just mistreating my man?\u201d As soon as I finished speaking, my father\u2019s disciple widened his eyes. He was probably taken aback, which was understandable.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m trying to save you, so keep your mouth shut. Okay?\u2019\u00a0I tried to hint at him with my intense gaze. Although my question was directed towards the baron, an unexpected group of people replied.\u201cWhat? What do you mean by that, my lady?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018my man\u2019?\u201dI became startled by their unusually gloomy voices.\u00a0\u2018Yikes, I forgot about the knights behind me!\u2019\u00a0It was a habit of mine to ignore the escort knights, who made me feel uncomfortable while I was shopping, so I accidentally forgot that they were following me.I turned around. \u201cHe\u2019s a secret escort my father privately assigned to me,\u201d I calmly said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very skilled mercenary.\u201d\u201cI was never told anything about this, my lady,\u201d Geraldine said stubbornly.\u2018He seriously lacks the ability to adapt to these kinds of situations.\u201d\u00a0I sighed and decided to explain the circumstances to them later, resorting to lying for the time being. \u201cI asked my father to keep it a secret from the escort knights because I thought it would displease you all.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking to someone right now, so I\u2019ll tell you the details later.\u201dGeraldine bowed with a sigh. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d When he stepped back, I glared at Baron Gordon.\u201cNow, do you really think I\u2019m going to let you go after messing with my escort, Baron Gordon?\u201dThe baron winced in response, then protested as if his pride was on the line. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018messing with him\u2019?! That man made me fall, then spoke to me informally! My question is, how are you going to compensate me for the damage done here?\u201dIn an aristocratic society, a subordinate\u2019s mistake was only held accountable by their master if the conflict got out of hand. It was more common for both parties to let the issue slide so as to not offend each other.\u00a0\u2018Now that he knows it\u2019s hopeless for us to have friendly relations, he\u2019s trying to squeeze some money out of me at the very least.\u2019\u00a0As expected of a self-made noble with common origins, he was servile but not the slightest bit agreeable, as indicated by how fast he had changed his attitude.\u2018I really dislike this person,\u2019\u00a0I thought and sighed. At first glance, I could tell that the baron had initiated the argument and unjustly demanded an apology. It was impossible for my father\u2019s disciple, with his fierce personality, to degrade himself before someone who picked a fight with him. Even if he had been in the wrong, I doubted he would have apologized to the baron.\u00a0\u2018It can\u2019t be helped. In a situation like this\u2026\u2019\u201cMy escort grew up in the countryside, so he isn\u2019t accustomed to social norms. Nevertheless, it\u2019s my fault that I didn\u2019t teach him any manners, so I will take full responsibility as his lady,\u201d I said softly, giving a death stare at the baron. He met my gaze in response, bearing a bright expression.\u2018He\u2019s probably excited about how much I will compensate him, isn\u2019t he? But as they say, \u2018an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\u2019\u2019\u00a0In this type of situation, it was common for the master to punish their subordinate or compensate the other party. But since I neither intended to discipline my father\u2019s disciple nor waste my precious money, I suggested a method that would resolve this problem peacefully and frugally.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we call it even if you speak informally to me as my escort did to you, Lord Gordon?\u201d I asked. The baron\u2019s smile immediately disappeared from his face.* * *\u2018Speak informally to her?\u2019\u00a0After digesting the lady\u2019s words, the baron shivered and realized something.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ve made a faulty judgment.\u2019\u00a0He was certain that the nobles he was acquainted with had babbled about the lady\u2019s lack of manners, as well as her dreadful and arrogant personality.\u201cGo ahead and speak informally to me,\u201d the woman said with a haughty tone, staring at him with an angry and intimidating gaze. No matter how much he observed her, she was not a little child but a fiend that would threaten his life the moment he left his guard down.\u2018This vile wench. She has the nerves to say that because she knows I\u2019m not able to speak informally to her.\u2019\u00a0The baron had become a nobleman by being shrewd, so he knew that if he spoke informally to the lady for the sake of his pride, he would be punished for mutiny. This crime was serious enough to take away his hard-earned, insignificant status.The baron hurriedly bowed. \u201cI have caused a great inconvenience to the lady. Please be generous and forgive me.\u201dEven though he apologized, the lady shook her head with disapproval. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should seek forgiveness from me, but from my escort,\u201d she said coldly.The baron gritted his teeth, livid by the prospect of bowing down to a commoner. Even so, he immediately lowered his head, knowing that he would enrage the lady if he didn\u2019t apologize. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened. It seems like I\u2019ve misunderstood you,\u201d he forced out. Sensing the insincerity of his words, Max stared down at him instead of responding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - My Secret Escort\u2018How dare a commoner act so arrogant toward me just because he\u2019s backed by the lady!\u2019\u00a0The baron stared back at Max, then reeled back when he saw the man\u2019s red eyes clouded with bloodlust.\u00a0\u2018I didn\u2019t realize it until now, but how are his eyes so\u2026\u2019\u00a0He suddenly came to his senses. He had done everything to climb the social hierarchy, from becoming a hitman bound by contract to threatening and harming others. Despite all his dirty deeds, he had never seen such menacing eyes.\u00a0\u2018That thing is dangerous.\u2019\u00a0Rather than the lady, the baron who was now frightened by this mere commoner. He gulped out of nervousness and felt the urge to leave this place as soon as possible.\u201cNow that I have apologized, I\u2019ll be leaving.\u201d When he disappeared, almost as if fleeing from the scene, Max scrutinized the baron and raised a corner of his lips deviously.\u00a0\u2018Baron Gordon\u2026 huh. I should kill this fool soon.\u2019At that moment, he heard a voice that tickled his ears. \u201cAre you okay? Did you get hurt anywhere?When the face he had been searching for came into view, his bloodthirsty eyes became docile right away.\u00a0\u2018Did she think I was going to get hurt by an idiot like him?\u2019\u00a0Max was about to respond in his usual manner, then stopped upon remembering what she had once told him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still in a situation where I\u2019m being ignored by people in high society. How will they take me seriously if you disrespect me as well?\u201dMax held her small, slender, and warm hands tightly and replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine, my lady.\u201dJubelian\u2019s eyes quivered in response.* * *\u2018I can\u2019t believe he just left like that.\u2019\u00a0It was odd to see the baron leave so quietly after causing a commotion and insisting on receiving an apology, but it wasn\u2019t so strange when I thought about it.\u00a0\u2018Well\u2026 It wasn\u2019t my intention to make him feel uncomfortable about speaking informally to me, but he probably felt that way, considering my social status.\u2019\u00a0There was no telling what he would\u2019ve done to my father\u2019s disciple if I hadn\u2019t intervened and unintentionally demeaned him.\u00a0\u2018No matter how skilled he is at swordsmanship, he won\u2019t be able to avoid getting punished for going against a nobleman.\u2019I cast a furtive glance at my father\u2019s disciple, but it didn\u2019t look like he was injured anywhere.\u00a0\u2018Hm, seeing as he\u2019s so stiff, is he shocked by what happened?\u2019\u00a0\u00a0I extended my hand towards him out of concern.\u201cAre you okay? Did you get hurt anywhere?\u201d I asked. He turned towards me in response. It didn\u2019t seem like he was frightened because his eyes weren\u2019t any different from usual.\u00a0\u2018That\u2019s a relief.\u2019\u00a0Was it because I had confided in him a few times already? We weren\u2019t close enough to be considered friends, but I felt comfortable around him.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m really glad. After what happened today, I was worried that he might become intimidated and keep his distance from me\u2026\u2019At that moment, he held my hands.\u00a0\u2018Um, why is he holding them very tightly?\u2019\u00a0His firm grasp reminded me of a lost child who had finally found his parents. I felt amused that I could sense such innocence from his big hands.\u00a0\u2018I guess he\u2019s relieved to see someone he knows.\u2019\u00a0It seemed like letting him stay in my room and feeding him hadn\u2019t been in vain because he was finally opening up towards me. At that moment, I heard him speak formally, which was something I thought I would never hear in my life.\u201cI\u2019m fine, my lady,\u201d he said. I never thought I would hear him speak like that in my life, so I became skeptical of him, rather than doubtful of my perfectly working ears.\u00a0\u2018Wait a minute\u2026 what\u2019s gotten into him?\u2019\u00a0I didn\u2019t understand why someone who frequently got into trouble for being stubborn and speaking informally was now giving me the opposite treatment.\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d His dispute with the baron had been ongoing for some time before I intervened, so it was possible someone hit him near his head. With this suspicion, I stared attentively at his face but couldn\u2019t see much because of his tall stature.\u00a0\u2018At least he has the height going for him.\u2019\u00a0Not only did he tower over me, but he was also handsome as well. Even though the commotion had passed, many people continued to stop and look at him.\u201cWho is that gentleman over there?\u201d\u201cHm, I\u2019m not sure, but isn\u2019t that Lady Floyen next to him?\u201d\u201cOh my, it is. And I see that they\u2019re holding hands!\u201dNo matter how big the plaza was, it was still located at the very center of the capital. It wasn\u2019t surprising that people recognized me as the infamous lady in high society.\u201cHey, we can stop\u2014\u201dI was about to tell him to let go of my hands so we could move somewhere else, but he interrupted me. \u201cThere\u2019s something I have to let you know, my lady. The contract you mentioned\u2026\u201dGoosebumps had risen on my skin from his politeness, but that was now a separate issue. I became startled at what he was about to say and covered his mouth with my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the payment you need from my father, right?\u201d I asked. This was a bluff; there was only one thing that he wanted to tell me right now, and that was his answer to my proposal to start a contractual relationship.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t have such an important conversation in such a crowded place, where people might be listening.\u2019\u201cFollow me.\u201d I continued to hold his hands and dragged him towards the carriage. \u201cHere, get in.\u201dInstead of getting in like I directed, however, he looked at me gently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get in first, my lady?\u201d His unexpected offer made me feel strange.\u00a0\u2018It seems like he\u2019s become a little kinder?\u2019\u201cSo why did you leave that day without saying anything?\u201d I asked when the carriage door closed. I had been secretly bothered by his angry expression and wondered if he hated the idea of being in a contractual relationship with me that much.\u00a0\u2018He should\u2019ve rejected me if that\u2019s the case. Then I could\u2019ve started brainstorming ideas on how to run away\u2026\u2019He gazed at me arrogantly, then tilted his head back as if he couldn\u2019t bear the sight of me any longer. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d he said.I knew it. It was impossible for someone to change so easily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - The Answer to Jubelian\u2019s Request\u201cI have something urgent to discuss with him, so please refrain from staying too close to the carriage.\u201d Despite ordering her escorts decisively, her soft tone wasn\u2019t forceful. Max gazed at Jubelian while thinking that her voice was pleasant to the ears.\u2018Now that I\u2019m observing her in these circumstances, she\u2019s very different.\u2019\u00a0Jubelian had always been excessively considerate towards him, which made her seem somewhat naive. But now that she was acting refined, as expected of the only daughter of a duke who bowed to no one but the imperial family, Max was no longer worried that someone might take advantage of her kindness.\u201cAlthough I trust you all, there will be consequences if someone eavesdrops on our conversation,\u201d she said. It was an unfamiliar sight to see her exercise her authority, but Max became relieved.\u00a0\u2018It seems like she won\u2019t get sucked into any trouble at least.\u2019\u00a0After the carriage door closed, Jubelian met his gaze.\u201cSo why did you leave that day without saying anything?\u201d she asked.Max became flustered by her question, even though he rarely found himself taken aback.\u00a0\u2018Shoot, what should I say?\u2019\u00a0he thought, remembering what she had said before.\u00a0\u201cThen I must run away.\u201d\u00a0He couldn\u2019t tell her the truth that he was the crown prince if she was just going to flee.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d he said, his voice somber from the thought of her running away.Jubelian let out a sigh instead of pressing him for an explanation. \u201cAlright. Then, what\u2019s your answer for the contractual relationship?\u201dMax hesitated before he could respond. There was something that had been bothering him ever since she first asked him, which was why she wanted to start a contractual relationship with him specifically. \u201cThere is something I need to ask you before I decide,\u201d he said, hoping the stifling feeling inside of him would dissipate once he heard the reason.\u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201d\u201cWhy did you suggest something like that to me?\u201d\u201cBy \u2018something like that\u2019\u2026 do you mean the contractual relationship?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Max responded, clenching his fists with an unknown source of tension. Jubelian\u2019s expression became more serious and her red lips parted.\u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026 you\u2019re my father\u2019s precious disciple?\u201d Unlike his expectations, her reason neither praised his appearance nor his swordsmanship skills. Max scrunched his face at her absurd answer.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s trying to date me for a trivial reason like that?\u2019\u00a0Disappointment and anger strangely surged inside of him.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m wasting my time with a woman like her\u2026\u2019If she were anyone else, he would have angrily lashed out at Jubelian for trying to use him, but he found himself unable to do so because\u2026 Well, he was looking at her. He felt his irritation subside the longer he looked at her.\u00a0\u2018Why on earth am I being swayed\u2026 by a woman like her?\u2019\u00a0Consumed by a sense of shame, Max frowned with a downcast gaze.\u201cThere\u2019s also another reason\u2026\u201d When he looked up, he saw her smiling sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019m comfortable with to ask this favor from.\u201dComfortable\u2026 Max felt that way with her as well. \u201cI see,\u201d he said. His sour mood immediately disappeared upon hearing that she felt the same way with him. He was filled with joy as his heart fluttered warmly. There were more questions he wanted to ask, but he didn\u2019t want to think about them anymore.\u00a0\u2018Yes, this is good enough.\u2019\u00a0Max smiled without realizing it.* * *I suddenly saw him smile in response.\u00a0\u2018Why is he smiling?\u2019\u00a0For some reason, it gave me a pleasant feeling.\u00a0\u2018I mean, it\u2019s no secret he\u2019s handsome.\u2019\u00a0Although I didn\u2019t want to admit it, I couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge that he was my type.\u00a0\u2018He might have a vile personality, but I wouldn\u2019t mind being in a relationship with someone with a face like that,\u2019\u00a0I thought. It was then I realized that I still hadn\u2019t gotten a decision from him.\u201cI answered your question, so shouldn\u2019t you answer my request now?\u201dHe nodded in response and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll accept your request.\u201dI smiled brightly, relieved that I had finally found a way to avoid my predestined death. \u201cThank you. How much do you want for compensation?\u201dHe furrowed his eyebrows and spoke coldly. \u201cI don\u2019t need any. I\u2019m just doing this to pay back what I owed you.\u201d When he finished speaking, I almost pictured him as an angel. Now that I was beginning to save money and become more aware of my finances, this would help me sustain an independent life in the future.\u00a0\u2018So what if he speaks without manners? He\u2019s too kind.\u2019I wrapped my hands around his, deeply moved. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m looking forward to our collaboration.\u201dHe scowled in response and said, \u201cAlright. I get it, so let go of my hands.\u201dI had no intention of letting go of his hands, however. \u201cWhat do you mean? We have to act like lovers from now on\u2026 It will be difficult to explain if you act halfheartedly!\u201d\u2018Because my life depends on this humorless act.\u2019\u00a0I swallowed the last part of my sentence and stared at him as I continued. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve decided to be in a contractual relationship, you must hold hands with me, lock arms with me, and address me affectionately. Do you understand?\u201d He looked at me with a hardened expression when I finished speaking. \u201cSay something,\u201d I said.He sighed in response. \u201cAlright,\u201d he quietly muttered. I raised the corner of my lips and proceeded to discuss something else that was essential for the start of a legitimate relationship.\u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t think you know my name yet, but\u2014\u201d I was about to tell my father\u2019s disciple my name because he always called me by \u2018you,\u2019 but he cut me off.\u201cJubelian,\u201d he said in a clear voice. I widened my eyes. \u201cI know what your name is,\u201d he said.My heart quivered when he spoke in an earnest voice, but I soon realized something and frowned.\u00a0\u2018Wait, why does this guy keep calling me \u2018you\u2019 when he knew my name this entire time?\u2019\u00a0Although I was disgruntled by this fact, a bigger problem posed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Could you tell me now?\u201d I spoke carefully so as to not hurt his feelings, but he luckily didn\u2019t seem offended by what I said. A brief silence ensued before he opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Max.\u201dMax. If I were to find fault with this name, it would be that it was a little close to the crown prince\u2019s name. Nevertheless, its meaning wasn\u2019t bad. \u201cThat\u2019s a good name. Your parents must\u2019ve wanted you to become a great person,\u201d I said.He stared at me for a while in response. \u201cYeah,\u201d he finally said. I thought he was going to look away from me again like he did before, but he continued to hold my gaze with his red, sunset-hued eyes. I felt strange for some reason and decided to change the subject.\u201cHey, about\u2014\u201dHe interrupted me. \u201cDidn\u2019t we just decide to call each other by our names?\u201dI smiled awkwardly because his words had caught me off guard. \u201cWe did, Max.\u201d A soft smile appeared on his face when I said his name. I stared at him for a while before deciding to get down to business. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we write out an official contract?\u201d At the word \u2018contract,\u2019 he scrunched his face at once and glared at me.\u201cA contract? Is it necessary to write such a thing? I clearly remember telling you that I didn\u2019t want to be compensated for this,\u201d he said. I sighed in response.\u00a0\u2018What did my father teach him, if not common sense? What if he gets scammed by someone?\u2019\u00a0As I sighed, I assumed the position of an instructor to help this pure, innocent man in front of me.\u201cAll contracts must be officially written out. If you don\u2019t do that, people will think you\u2019re a pushover and take advantage of you. What I mean is, they will refuse to compensate you or do bad things in your name.\u201d Although I could tell he was listening to me, he was looking at me with a clueless expression.\u00a0\u2018Ugh, should I explain it to him again?\u2019\u00a0I sighed and contemplated whether I should use simpler words so he could understand me. At that moment, he spoke in a sincere voice filled with conviction.\u201cBut you won\u2019t do that to me.\u201dHis words made me feel strange.\u00a0\u2018Until now, no one has ever trusted me\u2026\u2019\u00a0I had been living my role as a villainess, so it was natural for everyone to hate me. No one had ever confided in me before either, not even my father. \u2018Please trust me,\u2019 Jubelian had told him in the novel, but he merely ignored her pleas and threw her to prison. However, the man\u2019s red eyes, which were focused on me, didn\u2019t reveal a hint of doubt. A strange feeling arose within me, stirring the lower part of my heart.\u00a0\u2018Ah, this isn\u2019t the time to zone out.\u2019\u00a0When I barely managed to compose myself, I opened my mouth.\u201cScams are so effective because they\u2019re usually done by people you trust!\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s why no matter how close you are with someone, you shouldn\u2019t hold them accountable for their words but write an official contract. Okay?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d He sighed and nodded at my continuous nagging. His obedient response only made me become more worried.\u00a0\u2018This guy is really naive and ignorant of worldly affairs\u2026 will he be able to handle this unkind reality?\u2019I had originally been worried about his fearsome personability, but now I was worried about his carelessness and ignorance. After mulling over my concerns for a while, I made a promise to myself.\u00a0\u2018Since we\u2019re in a contractual relationship, I will teach him a lot of things.\u2019\u00a0I actually felt bad that he had refused compensation, so I would repay the favor by teaching him life lessons.\u201cBefore we write the contract, let\u2019s come to terms about the most important thing.\u201d\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201dWhen he prompted me, I told him something I had been thinking about for a while. \u201cGeraldine is the leader of the escort knights, and based on his personality, he will definitely interrogate us on how we\u2019ve met. We can\u2019t tell him the truth, so we should make up a story we both agree on.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026I see.\u201d Even he couldn\u2019t deny my reasoning, knowing that our first meeting involved trespassing, threats, and a sword.\u201cSo, I was thinking\u2026 How about this story?\u201d I told him a scenario I had been thinking about for a while, but he quickly raised his voice.\u201cWhat? I absolutely hate it!\u201dI looked at him and saw that he clearly loathed my scheme. \u201cDo you have anything better then?\u201d I asked with a stern expression.\u201cCan\u2019t we switch the roles? What if I\u2019m the one who\u2014\u201dI cut him off. \u201cNo, that won\u2019t make sense. You know I\u2019m always surrounded by knights.\u201d I studied the man who was now deep in thought, then took his hands and held them tightly. \u201cIt might be daunting now, but it won\u2019t mean anything later. If it\u2019s still too difficult for you, you can just stand next to me and let me take the lead.\u201dAs I coaxed him, he nodded with a blank expression. \u201cAlright.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Introducing My BoyfriendI opened the carriage door and walked out with him. \u201cMake your hand on my shoulder more obvious,\u201d I whispered quietly. His hand, which had been at an awkward position on top of my shoulder, promptly covered its entirety. \u201cGood job,\u201d I praised him, to which he remained silent. Although I hadn\u2019t expected him to put on a convincing act in the first place, I felt a little frustrated.\u2018I guess there\u2019s no choice but for me to bear the bulk of this task.\u2019\u00a0The escort knights waiting for me seemed to be taken aback by the sight of us coming out of the carriage, posing as a couple. In particular, Geraldine, the leader of the escort knights and my cousin, stared at me while pressing his fingers against his temples.\u201cCould you explain to me what in the world is happening here, my lady?\u201d As expected, he began interrogating me about our relationship.\u201cWhat I told you earlier was actually a lie, Sir Geraldine,\u201d I confessed.Geraldine nodded in response as if knowing it was a lie in the first place. \u201cAh, yes. His Grace would never assign a task to an outsider without letting me know.\u201d He studied me with a probing gaze and continued. \u201cSo who is that man, and why is he allowed to act so intimately with you?\u201d he asked coldly.\u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend,\u201d I announced confidently.* * *His hand, which covered her small shoulder, felt hot.\u201cGood job,\u201d she said. Although Max was aware that she had said something, he was too preoccupied with worries that she might become aware of his rapidly beating heart.\u00a0\u2018She won\u2019t notice it, will she?\u2019\u00a0To ensure that she wouldn\u2019t, he tried to restrain himself with focused intensity. At that moment, a disobliging voice met his ears.\u201cSo who is that man, and why is he allowed to act so intimately with you?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201dAs soon as Jubelian said these words, angry protests burst out.\u201cWhat? How can you say that, my lady?!\u201d\u201cWe have always escorted you closely, but we\u2019ve never seen a man like him.\u201dMax removed his trembling hand from Jubelian\u2019s shoulder and clenched his fists.\u00a0\u2018How annoying.\u2019\u00a0He had considered her escort knights to be eyesores for a while now, disliking that they were allowed to be near her in the first place. It was furthermore ridiculous that these transparent men dared to show hostility towards him. At that moment, Jubelian placed her hand on top of his.\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered with a light smile. The moment he saw her face, he felt his sizzling anger gradually subside. As his heart swelled and tingled, Jubelian turned back to the knights. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for you all not to know about him. I met him at Count Meissen\u2019s banquet, which was held quite a while ago.\u201d The knights stared at Max with quivering eyes in response.\u2018No way, is he a nobleman?\u2019\u2018I can tell he\u2019s well-off, despite being dressed in shabby clothes.\u2019Count Meissen was known for holding banquets with guests who only came from reputable, aristocratic families. If the man in front of them had attended such an event, he was probably an esteemed son from a renowned house.\u00a0\u2018Which family is he from? I\u2019ve never seen him in the capital.\u2019\u00a0Geraldine observed Max with sharp eyes.\u201cHe\u2019s not a nobleman, but a mercenary hired to compensate for the lack of guards,\u201d Jubelian said. The knights narrowed their eyes at the word \u2018mercenary.\u2019\u201cI wonder why a mere mercenary approached our lady,\u201d Geraldine said. The other knights\u2019 eyes became filled with condescension as well.\u2018How dare mere knights look at me with those eyes.\u2019\u00a0Max scowled, feeling the urge to immediately draw his sword and display his superiority in strength. Nevertheless, the hand that held him was so warm that his irritation couldn\u2019t help but diminish.\u00a0\u2018How did I end up like this?\u2019\u00a0Max thought to himself as his insides blazed with heat. Oblivious to this, Jubelian spoke to counter Geraldine\u2019s accusation.\u201cWe met each other during a critical situation,\u201d she said.When the knights heard the phrase \u2018critical situation,\u2019 they lowered their aggression toward Max.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Ah, I see. This man saved our lady from a critical situation.\u2019\u00a0But the unexpected explanation that ensued made the knights doubt their hearing.\u201cI saved him from being surrounded and cornered by many noblewomen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry? You saved him, my lady?\u201d\u201cYes, they all went away when I asked for the whereabouts of Mikhail.\u201d It made sense that the noblewomen had run away from her, as Jubelian was infamous for committing wicked acts towards people who approached Mikhail. \u201cThen this man told me he wanted to return my favor, saying that he owed me his life. Although I declined his offer and continued to search for Mikhail, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. He\u2019s the reason why I broke up my ex-boyfriend as well.\u201d\u2018So this is why she broke up with Mikhail?\u2019\u00a0All the knights wore astonished expressions.\u201cWhen we met each other again at Arcade Street today as if by destiny, I was certain that he was the person for me. You all don\u2019t understand how moved I was when I found out that he was looking for me as well.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Introducing My BoyfriendThe knights became flustered by her story for a while, then gave sinister looks at Max.\u00a0\u2018How dare a commoner do such a thing.\u2019\u00a0It was understandable that Jubelian thought and acted this way, as she was someone who possessed no awareness when she was blindly in love. However, they couldn\u2019t help but think that it was absurd for a commoner to not know his place and attempt to court the daughter of a duke.Max realized that the knights were trying to intimidate him by giving him menacing looks.\u00a0\u2018How irritating,\u2019\u00a0\u00a0he thought to himself.\u00a0He was already out of patience from what happened with Baron Gordon not so long ago. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say it was a miracle for him to remain so composed until now, as he had never endured people who acted belligerently towards him.\u00a0\u2018Right, I should stomp on these bugs who think they can intimidate me,\u2019\u00a0he thought to himself. After coming to this decision, he conveyed clear antagonism using his eyes. The knights who received his sharp, vicious energy head-on flinched and instinctively reached for their swords.\u2018What\u2026is that man?\u2019\u00a0Through the sheer force he had emitted, they could tell he was someone who walked the path of swordsmanship rather than knightship.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s strong. Where did a man like him suddenly appear from?\u2019\u00a0His gaze was so dangerous that it ignited the knights\u2019 impulse to draw their swords and prepare themselves for an opponent\u2019s attack. However, they couldn\u2019t act rashly because Jubelian stood right next to him. At that moment, a cold voice broke the silence.\u201cExcuse me. Are you all threatening my boyfriend?\u201d Jubelian asked.\u2018We\u2019re the ones being threatened!\u2019\u00a0the knights lamented silently in response. Feeling as if he was being treated unfairly, one knight tried to confess the truth. \u201cThat\u2019s not it, my lady\u2026\u201dHe trailed off when Jubelian narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018that\u2019s not it?\u2019 Did you think I couldn\u2019t see the frightening expressions you all were making at him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it, Jubelian. What happened just now\u2014\u201d Geraldine tried to tell her that there was someone even more frightening behind her, but Jubelian continued to rattle on without giving him any more time to explain himself.\u201cHe\u2019s so terrified that his hands are shaking!\u201d she exclaimed. Max, who was standing behind Jubelian, smirked at her words. The sight appalled the knights.\u2018Please look behind you,\u2019\u00a0they wanted to desperately tell her. However, Jubelian continued to look at them.\u201cAs a group of people daring to intimidate a single person, you\u2019re the same as the noblewomen back then. You all should be ashamed!\u201dThe knights tried to suppress their dissatisfaction when she spoke sternly, but they recalled the duke\u2019s orders.\u00a0\u201cPlease protect my daughter,\u201d\u00a0he had said. Until now, the knights had guarded Jubelian wordlessly due to their loyalty to the duke. Although it was part of their job to frighten others, they truly believed that this situation was unjust because they hadn\u2019t done anything.\u201cMy lady, we really\u2026\u201d Todd trailed off when Jubelian turned around as if she couldn\u2019t even bear to spare another glance at the knights anymore.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked Max.He nodded slowly. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201dThe man who had been looking at them with a bloodthirsty gaze suddenly hid his hostility, acting innocently in front of the lady.\u00a0\u2018Seriously, what kind of person does that?\u2019\u00a0The knights gaped in astonishment and couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the man had deliberately set up the situation at the banquet to get close to Jubelian.\u201cMy lady, that man\u2026\u201d Geraldine tried to warn her, but Jubelian held Max\u2019s hand tightly and glared at the knights.\u201cJust know that we will be going back to the mansion for now,\u201d she said coldly. Then she directed her next words at Max and lowered her voice to whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will protect you no matter what.\u201dMax furrowed his eyebrows, then let out a sigh.\u00a0\u2018A weakling like you\u2026\u2019\u00a0Her words were preposterous, but for some reason, he didn\u2019t mind her nonsensical words nor the warm hands around his.* * *When we arrived at the mansion, the butler looked at Max with surprise. \u201cMy lady, how did you come back with\u2026?\u201d Perhaps it was because he knew Max was my father\u2019s disciple, but Derrick was unable to continue.\u00a0\u2018If I\u2019m going to tell everyone anyway, I should make it clear at the start,\u2019\u00a0I thought to myself.\u201cHe\u2019s my guest,\u201d I said.I couldn\u2019t tell what Derrick was thinking when I said that, but he let out a sigh. \u201cAh, I see. Then I\u2019ll take him to the drawing room\u2014\u201dI interrupted him. \u201cHe\u2019s also my boyfriend.\u201dClang!At the sound of something falling to the ground, I turned around and saw my father looking at us with an astounded expression. \u201cJubelian, what did you just\u2026\u201d He trailed off. On one hand, I felt nervous that the very situation I had been planning for finally arrived. On the other hand, I felt hopeful because I could finally get rid of the problem that had been bothering me. I wore a satisfied smile and opened my mouth.\u201cMax, say hello. This is my father.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Father\u2019s Anger\u201cJubelian, what did you just say?\u201d My father\u2019s expression hardened in response. I had never seen his eyes look so ferocious before. He almost looked barbaric, which was unlike someone who was usually indifferent about everything.\u2018Wow, a person who was indifferent even when I caused so much trouble before can become upset like that,\u2019\u00a0I thought to myself. A small urge to rebel rose inside me.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s probably upset that I refuse to become his puppet and comply with the arranged marriage, tempting his disciple instead.\u2019I proudly locked my arm around Max\u2019s and said, \u201cAs I just said, we\u2019re officially starting a relationship.\u201dMy father glared at me in response and quietly said, \u201cFirst come inside, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d The lies I told Geraldine and the knights worked because they were rather naive. However, I was bound to get caught by my father if I told him the same lies. For this reason, I decided to mix some truth in my story.\u2018Will I be able to pull it off?\u2019\u00a0I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t nervous, but I didn\u2019t want to have doubts at this moment.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019ll be okay. I can do it,\u2019\u00a0I silently encouraged myself. At that moment, the arm that was locked around mine loosened. Max had unfastened his hold from me.\u00a0\u2018Didn\u2019t I ask for cooperation?\u2019\u00a0I gave him a look, trying to convey this, but became surprised upon realizing that he had removed his arm so he could hold my hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 my lady,\u201d he said. Although his words sounded awkward, I didn\u2019t mind because he had addressed me formally.\u00a0\u2018And is it because he\u2019s with me?\u2019\u00a0For some reason, I wasn\u2019t frightened at the thought of being scolded today.* * *\u2018How did it end up like this?\u2019\u00a0Regis clenched his fists, realizing that he should\u2019ve been more vigilant in order to keep his sly disciple away from his daughter.\u00a0\u2018What on earth are you scheming, Maximilian?\u2019\u00a0Regis was certain that Max had planned this situation with wicked intentions, as he knew best about his disciple\u2019s inhumane and evil personality. The reason he wanted to get close to Jubelian was probably\u2026\u00a0\u2018Does he want to get me involved in the rebellion by using Jubell?\u2019\u00a0As his uncertain guesses became more clear, a smug smile appeared on Regis\u2019 face.\u201cMaster, you need to let go of your pawns at the right time. It\u2019s common sense to make some sacrifices during a revolution,\u201d\u00a0his disciple had once said. Max was clearly someone who saw people as pieces on a chessboard, so it was possible he harbored even more wicked intentions than he had predicted.\u00a0\u2018How dare he consider my daughter a pawn.\u2019\u00a0Although his speculations weren\u2019t confirmed, he couldn\u2019t help but feel enraged. His disciple had already made a move on his daughter, after all.\u00a0\u2018You scoundrel. How could you pay me back by becoming my enemy?\u2019\u00a0Although their relationship hadn\u2019t started with pure intentions, Regis never hesitated to give his disciple advice because he valued him at heart. He had even protected his disciple from the assassins sent by the empress when he was young, but it seems like all his efforts and support had gone to waste.\u2018I can\u2019t let a monster like you take my daughter away from me.\u2019\u00a0Regis clenched his teeth in disgust. Although he really wanted to punish his ungrateful disciple, he knew that Jubelian would be unhappy if he did so, considering her nature to cherish the people and things she liked.\u00a0\u2018How irritating,\u2019\u00a0Regis thought.\u00a0He felt as if his head was going to burst, but he carefully tried to hide his feelings and offered his daughter and disciple a seat.\u201cSit down,\u201d he said. When Jubelian was about to sit, Max pulled a chair out for her.\u201cHere.\u201dShe smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201dIf it was the disciple that Regis knew, he wouldn\u2019t have been affected by her words at all. Nonetheless, the despicable man in front of him meekly replied, \u201cSure.\u201d\u2018That spiteful rascal. He tricked my daughter by putting on an act.\u2019\u00a0Regis clenched his fists. Having observed Max for a long time, he knew that he was rarely affected by things. He had even once said,\u00a0\u201cYou want me to show compassion to the weak? That will only get me beheaded.\u201d\u00a0Regis had tried to fix his disciple\u2019s personality multiple times, but he only became more perverse.\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no way a guy like him would suddenly change,\u2019\u00a0he thought to himself.\u201cHow did you two meet?\u201d Regis asked coldy as if interrogating them. There was an aura of aggression emanating from his eyes.\u201cDuring the few days you were gone, he came to visit you. Since you weren\u2019t here and there was no place for him to go, I let him stay in my room for a while,\u201d Jubelian said.Unable to suppress his anger, Regis twisted his expression.\u00a0\u2018So this is why that vile snake lured me to the imperial palace!\u2019Although she was mostly expressionless, his daughter had a soft heart from a young age.\u201cI don\u2019t want these birds anymore, so don\u2019t catch them, okay?\u201d\u00a0she once said to Derrick when her pet bird died. She had only been seven years old.\u2018What\u2019s more, she\u2019s someone who couldn\u2019t ignore the abandoned dogs and cats she saw in the streets.\u2019\u00a0Regis knew that his daughter was lenient towards weak and pitiable existences, so he couldn\u2019t help but become even more infuriated at his disciple.\u00a0\u2018I will never forgive you for taking advantage of my daughter\u2019s kindness.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Father\u2019s Anger\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask Derrick? He could\u2019ve taken you to a guest room,\u201d Regis said, looking at Max with a murderous gaze. Although his words were directed at Max, the response came from his daughter.\u201cIt was very late at night, so I felt awkward to tell anyone since the knights had already come by. I also thought he wouldn\u2019t harm me since he\u2019s your disciple, Father.\u201dRegis sighed softly in response.\u00a0\u2018Actually, he\u2019s the most dangerous one\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max used whatever means as necessary to fulfill his own purposes. In Regis\u2019 eyes, he was no different from an outrageous tyrant. And judging by his atrocious personality, he wasn\u2019t going to think twice about inflicting danger on his daughter once he decided she was useless or became displeased by her.\u00a0\u2018That child probably doesn\u2019t even know that her life is at risk.\u2019\u00a0Nevertheless, Regis couldn\u2019t blame his daughter because she had a valid reason for letting him into her room, which was his identity as her father\u2019s disciple.\u00a0\u2018Yes, it\u2019s probably my fault from the start. I shouldn\u2019t have accepted him as my disciple\u2026\u2019\u00a0he thought as he sipped his well-brewed tea. It emanated a pleasant and mellow scent, but he could only taste bitterness in his mouth.Regis soon spoke coldly, criticizing Max for not showing any consideration for Jubelian. \u201cThat was inappropriate of you, considering her reputation.\u201d But the person who responded again was his daughter.\u201cYou probably know this already, Father, but I don\u2019t care that much about my reputation,\u201d she said. Although Regis\u2019 heart ached at the exaggerated rumors about his daughter, he didn\u2019t care much about them either. No matter what other people said, he knew that his daughter was a lovely and kind person. At that moment, Jubelian straightened up and looked straight at Regis. \u201cStill, I was extremely careful because I was afraid of causing you any trouble. And nothing actually happened between us.\u201d Regis became taken aback by his daughter\u2019s eyes, which became filled with vigor. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to say this, but I\u2019ve only been in an one-sided relationship until now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a miracle for someone I like to like me back.\u201d Jubelian let out a sigh, then said quietly, \u201cFather, you might not trust me because I\u2019ve caused all sorts of problems until now, but I will never disgrace our family\u2019s prestigious name. So please allow us to date.\u201dRegis had originally planned to say that this was absolutely impossible, but he began to develop a soft spot for his daughter when he heard her desperate pleas.\u00a0\u2018How do you manage to\u2026 make me so weak like this?\u2019\u00a0She was the apple of his eye. Regis truly wanted to do everything he could for Jubelian, but the problem was the terrible existence she was attached to.Regis gathered himself and said resolutely, \u201cI can\u2019t allow you guys to date. End the relationship.\u201d* * *\u2018I see. He has already made up his mind to marry me off to the crown prince.\u2019\u00a0I sighed in response. An arranged marriage between the crazy, tyrannical crown prince and the duke\u2019s only daughter. Other nobles might have also considered having the prince as their son-in-law, but they would never go as far to make it a reality. However, my father was a transcendent being, so he looked far younger than his actual age. If he wanted to, he could probably get married again and bear a successor in the near future. He could start over any time he wanted to, so it made sense that he wanted to trade with the royal family rather than give his foolish daughter a fresh start. It was simply a more advantageous choice for him.\u00a0\u2018What do I do now?\u2019\u00a0If I opposed my father, he would certainly force me to get married with the crown prince. I sighed in frustration, hanging my head low, when someone grasped my hand tightly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d a firm voice said. It was unlike my timid personality.\u00a0\u2018Huh?\u2019\u00a0I looked at Max with surprise. He looked back at me before staring angrily at my father. \u201cDo remember that time you lectured me, Master?\u201d he asked sternly. At that moment, I was lifted out of my chair. More accurately, Max had lifted me in bridal style.\u00a0\u2018What is this guy trying to\u2026?\u2019\u00a0I gave him a frantic look, but he continued to face forward with a cold expression. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found it. My weakness.\u201dIn response to his words, which sounded oddly familiar, my father\u2019s expression became even more bitter. \u201cYou do a good job of jabbering about something that\u2019s not even true,\u201d he said.\u201cThen what about you, Master? You\u2019re being overbearing with your grown daughter,\u201d his disciple said. I frankly hadn\u2019t expected much for his acting, but he spoke in such a convincingly icy voice as if he had become infatuated with his own performance. \u201cIf you meddle with my weakness again, I will not stand by even if you\u2019re my master,\u201d he continued.I inhaled sharply at his words.\u00a0\u2018No, he should\u2019ve said that moderately. That was too much.\u2019\u00a0I carefully watched the master and disciple who had become spiteful toward each other, unable to stop them. At that moment, my father showed an inexplicably cold smile.\u201cAlright, if you say so. I will also not consider you as my disciple anymore,\u201d he said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Max\u2019s Apology\u2018Is he trying to cut ties with his only disciple?\u2019\u00a0I was appalled by my father\u2019s shocking words, unable to believe that he would ruin their precious relationship just because of me.Max looked indifferent as if he had expected this reaction from my father. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want as well,\u201d he said. After watching the two clash for a while, I became confused.\u00a0\u2018Why are they fighting all of a sudden? And to sever ties with each other completely\u2026\u2019\u00a0I was puzzled about what I should do because I hadn\u2019t expected this development.At that moment, Max turned to me. \u201cLet\u2019s go Jubelian,\u201d he said. It seemed like he was fully immersed with mastering the techniques of method acting. When we reached the door, I became conscious of what I was doing.\u00a0\u2018No matter how I look at it, this situation is like\u2026 an elopement, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u00a0Although an elopement sounded nice, my partner was a poor, homeless man. My original plan was to show my father that we were in a relationship so he wouldn\u2019t marry me off to the crown prince. I thought it would work because he cared a lot about his disciple, but my father showed strong opposition against our relationship, effectively ruining my plans.\u2018I need to stop him.\u2019\u00a0Although I had thought about running away at one point, that was only for the worst case scenario. My ultimate goal was to inherit my father\u2019s money and become so rich that I wouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger. If I left with him like this, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to get my valuables and my father would only drag me back\u2026 which was the last thing I wanted.\u201cHey, I\u2014\u201dAs I was trying to stop Max, someone interrupted me. \u201cStop.\u201dI flinched upon hearing the cold voice, which sounded like it was warning us.\u00a0\u2018Oh, he\u2019s probably angry,\u2019\u00a0I thought to myself.At that moment, I heard my father\u2019s stern voice again. \u201cI said stop,\u201d he said. If we didn\u2019t listen to him this time, I had a feeling that I would become my father\u2019s enemy as well.\u201cMax, wait a minute\u2014\u201dI attempted to stop Max again, but he spoke over me. \u201cDon\u2019t order me around,\u201d he said callously.I hardened my expression.\u00a0\u2018Wait, this isn\u2019t right.\u2019\u00a0No matter how grim our relationship was, he was still my father. It wasn\u2019t pleasant to have someone be so rude to him. I looked back at my father, who looked exasperated despite his icy eyes.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll be in trouble if I don\u2019t say anything now.\u2019When my father clenched his fists, I called out to him urgently. \u201cFather!\u201d His ferocious gaze, which had been directed at Max, turned to me. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d I said. Although I knew he thought of me as an unreliable person, I desperately hoped that he would trust me this time. I couldn\u2019t bear to say any more and gazed at him earnestly instead. Whether he had seen through my silent prayers or decided to give up on his good-for-nothing daughter, he sighed and made way for us. Max passed by him triumphantly, probably thinking I had taken his side. When we left the drawing room and passed through a quiet hallway, there was no one nearby.I grabbed Max\u2019s shirt. \u201cPlease let me go for a second. I have something to say, Max.\u201d He frowned as if to protest, but I looked at him in the eyes. \u201cCome on now,\u201d I said calmly, \u201cit\u2019s something very important.\u201d My feet soon touched the floor.\u201cSo what is it that you want to say?\u201d he asked in a disinterested tone.I stared at him and said, \u201cThank you for being angry for me. But what you said to my father back there was too much.\u201dHis handsome face crumpled in response. \u201cI helped you\u2026\u201d Well, it\u2019s understandable why he was upset. He had defended me with good intentions, but I was blaming him for that. He had every right to feel offended, but I still couldn\u2019t let his rude behavior slide.\u201cBy doing something I disapprove of, are you really helping me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d he shot back as if he had just heard something ridiculous.I shook my head at his response. \u201cI never wanted you to be exiled, nor did I ever want you to be rude to my father.\u201dIt seemed like he was angry at me, seeing as how was glaring at me and murmuring to himself. Despite his fierce, aggressive, and animalistic eyes, I continued speaking without hesitation. \u201cForcefully doing something against the other person\u2019s wishes isn\u2019t helping them. That\u2019s simply for your own satisfaction,\u201d I explained.I fell silent and stared at his flickering eyes, which looked like flames. He opened his mouth after a moment of silence. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t need my help anymore?\u201d he asked.\u201cOf course I need your help, but if you\u2019re just going to act on your own, I\u2019ll have no choice but to come up with a different solution,\u201d I said. His face slightly darkened in response. I realized how naive and childlike he was as he became lost in thought, reminding me of the past Jubelian. I usually wouldn\u2019t give lengthy explanations like this, but was it because he was similar to the past me? Even I was wondering why I was acting like this. I let out a sigh and said, \u201cI\u2019m not saying this because I want to grow distant from you. I want to stay with you for a long time and get to know you better, but I said these things so that we won\u2019t have any resentment between us.\u201d\u201cI was trying to help you back there,\u201d he insisted.\u201cI know, but my father is a duke. What you did wasn\u2019t helpful if you think about the future troubles he could bring.\u201dA brief moment of silence followed, which he soon broke with a sigh. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he asked.\u201cI want you to make up with my father,\u201d I said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Isn\u2019t it just terrible?\u201d I saw him slowly nodding at what I said.\u00a0\u2018I shouldn\u2019t force them to make peace. This is my problem to begin with, after all.\u2019\u00a0Although it was unfortunate they had become estranged from each other, I didn\u2019t plan to coerce him into apologizing if he didn\u2019t want to. I had already caused a big problem by telling my father I didn\u2019t want to go meet with the crown prince, so something was bound to work out. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t plan on pressuring you to apologize. You don\u2019t have to force\u2014\u201dAt that moment, he cut me off and said, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll apologize.\u201dI held his hands tightly when I heard these unexpected words. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said, giving him a bright smile.* * *The senses of transcendent beings easily exceeded those of ordinary people. For example, Regis could easily detect a rat wandering around the building. As he listened to Jubelian and Max in the hallway, he could feel a headache forming.\u2018He changed his mind? And all because of Jubelian\u2026\u2019\u00a0His disciple, the crown prince, possessed a rude, arrogant, and self-centered personality. However, his behavior a while ago was drastically different from his behavior over the past decade.\u201cIf you meddle with my weakness once again, I will not sit still even if you\u2019re my master,\u201d\u00a0he had said.Regis narrowed his eyes.\u00a0\u2018Did he really change?\u2019\u00a0However, these thoughts were fleeting because Max had just returned to the drawing room with blatant enmity in his gleaming eyes.\u00a0\u2018Right, there\u2019s no way you would change.\u2019\u00a0Now that he was thinking about it, Max had always tried to hide his weakness instead of accepting them.\u201cPeople will laugh if they discover that the imperial prince hates cucumbers,\u201d\u00a0he had once said. It was thus impossible for someone like him to accept his daughter as his weakness.\u2018The bottom line is that he\u2019s going to try to take advantage of my daughter until the very end\u2026\u2019\u00a0Regis stared at his disciple with an eerie gaze.\u00a0\u2018Do you think I\u2019m just going to sit around and watch you do that?\u2019\u00a0Between the master and his pupil, there was a significant difference in their swordsmanship skills. He could make his arrogant disciple kneel in front of him if he wanted to, but Regis was soon forced to soften his merciless thoughts.\u201cMax has something to say, Father,\u201d Jubelian said. His boiling blood ceased the moment he saw his daughter come back with his disciple, but he still had no intentions of forgiving his disciple.\u2018I\u2019ll put up with you for now, but I won\u2019t let you go if you try to manipulate my daughter again, Maximilian.\u2019Max, who saw the warning in his master eyes, smirked.\u00a0\u2018This confirms the fact that my blind date with Jubelian was the result of false information.\u2019\u00a0It didn\u2019t make sense for his master to act this way in the first place, seeing as he had always acted cautiously and quietly when it came to his daughter. Max hadn\u2019t even known about the blind date either. And there was no way someone like the duke would\u2019ve tried to get his daughter involved with the crown prince, who was in a precarious position. That\u2019s why Max used Jubelian to see his master\u2019s reaction to their relationship. Sure enough, his master had responded with a firm rejection.\u00a0\u2018I see. So Jubelian has some misunderstandings about the blind date, after all\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly.\u00a0\u2018And there\u2019s no reason for me to clear up this misunderstanding.\u2019\u00a0If they were to find out the truth, his master would only listen to his daughter\u2019s wishes and make it so that Max could no longer meet Jubelian.\u201cThen I must run away,\u201d\u00a0she had once said.Max didn\u2019t care the slightest if people tarnished his name and called him a bloodthirsty devil. He placed his survival at greater importance than his reputation, but he was strangely upset and heartbroken at the thought of Jubelian misunderstanding him from the rumors.\u00a0\u2018If I reveal that I\u2019m the crown prince after being nice to her for a while, it\u2019ll clear up the misunderstandings.\u2019\u00a0For this reason, Max decided to linger around Jubelian longer, which meant he had to say the words she wanted him to say.\u201cI apologize for what happened earlier, Master,\u201d he said.Regis smiled smugly when his vile disciple called him by the title he had just discarded. \u201cI don\u2019t have any disciples,\u201d he said.Max frowned at his decisive words.\u00a0\u2018Oh, so he\u2019s going to play like this?\u2019\u00a0He wanted to act like he was sorry for Jubelian\u2019s sake, but his master\u2019s unchanging and perverse attitude damaged his pride. Whatever he had been trying to do, he felt like he simply couldn\u2019t do it anymore.Max opened his mouth. \u201cI\u2014\u201dAt that moment, Jubelian kneeled on the floor, causing both Regis and Max to scrunch their faces. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, Father,\u201d she confessed.* * *I sighed as I watched the overaggressive dispute between master and disciple.\u00a0\u2018These guys\u2026 I don\u2019t think they will be able to make up.\u2019\u00a0At this rate, they were just going to continue wasting time rather than reconcile, so I decided to take an extreme measure.\u2018I\u2019ll just say that it was my fault, beg for forgiveness, and inform him that I\u2019ll continue dating Max.\u2019\u00a0With this in mind, I kneeled on the ground. It was probably better than standing stiffly.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s actually not that bad to kneel because of the carpet,\u2019\u00a0I thought to myself.At that moment, I heard Max\u2019s stern voice. \u201cJubelian, I\u2019m the one who should apologize!\u201dI frowned at his words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Off to a Rocky Start\u201cMax, I\u2014\u201d\u201cGet up.\u201d\u201cRight now, I\u2014\u201d\u201cGet up now! I\u2019m going to apologize!\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe how tactless he was being! I frowned at the man who was demanding me to get up multiple times now. \u201cI have something important to say to my father\u2026\u201d I trailed off and heard my father speak from above me.\u201cI understand. Get up first, then we can discuss this,\u201d he said. I found it odd that the two of them had suddenly become agreeable with each other.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with them suddenly?\u2019\u00a0I was confused for a moment, but then remembered that I hadn\u2019t achieved my goal yet.\u00a0\u2018My father still hasn\u2019t forgiven him; I can\u2019t let my guard down.\u2019\u00a0Right now, my goal was to convince my father to take back what he had said about exiling Max. Instead of getting up, I shook my head and answered, \u201cFather, it\u2019s my fault that Max is being impolite right now. So please forgive him with an open heart\u2026\u201dBefore I finished, my father nodded his head. \u201cYes, I forgive him. Now, get up.\u201d\u2018Huh? This easily?\u2019\u00a0Feeling somewhat discouraged, I looked up at my father. At that moment, Max held out his hand to me.\u201cHere,\u201d he said. I felt his warmth as I took his hand. He helped me onto my feet and wrapped his arm around my shoulders. It was a strange feeling having a person who was cold to me during our first meeting now reach out his hand gently to me.\u2018Seems like he\u2019s become more human.\u2019As I stared blankly at our connected hands, my father spoke coldly. \u201cHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m allowing you guys to date.\u201dI sighed at his firm voice.\u00a0\u2018Yeah, I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be that easy.\u2019* * *Regis gazed at his daughter with a sorrowful look.\u00a0\u2018This is my fault.\u2019\u00a0Since his current circumstances didn\u2019t allow for him to show his daughter affection, he wanted to do everything he could for her. Nevertheless, there was one thing he couldn\u2019t do no matter what.\u2018I can\u2019t let him date her.\u2019Max was the crown prince who was distrusted by his father, the emperor. His situation was like a candle in the wind. Due to the malicious rumors spread about him, most of the nobles did not have faith in him. Furthermore, the empress, who was successful in taking over the legislative body, sent assassins after Max while manipulating public opinion about the empire. The rumors she spread about the crown prince painted him as a tyrant who didn\u2019t shed blood or tears and who only viewed his allies as pawns. Moreover, it seemed that his disciple was becoming the cold-blooded person described in those rumors.\u201cDuke Floyen, I\u2019m not saying you should stand by him. Just this once, please do him a favor,\u201d\u00a0the empress had said. As his master, and to pay back his debt to the empress, he had attempted to humanize his disciple multiple times. However, all he got in return was cynicism.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be efficient if the majority could benefit from the sacrifice of the minority?\u201d\u00a0his disciple had asked. If Jubelian married Max, a cold-blooded man who viewed people as objects, her future was obvious.With a fierce look in his eyes, Regis stared at his disciple.\u00a0\u2018What a fool. It\u2019s careless to think of your pawns as useless.\u2019\u00a0Over the years, he had witnessed thousands of cases; someone who had terrible swordsmanship yet stood out in terms of resourcefulness and someone who looked average on the outside but had the leadership to boost the group\u2019s morale. Regis thought everyone had room to grow and improve, similar to a pawn that was promoted to a queen when it had reached the other side of a chessboard.\u2018If she marries a man who doesn\u2019t value his people, she will only end up walking a thorny path.\u2019Regis was continuing to stare at his disciple with ferocious eyes when Jubelian spoke. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for your permission right now, Father. Just for a while, please keep an eye on us before deciding on your decision.\u201dGazing into her periwinkle eyes, Regis listened to her faint but strong voice. He could tell that she was determined to date Max.\u2018Even if I don\u2019t allow it, she would still date him,\u2019\u00a0he realized.It\u2019s said that parents have a soft spot for their children and Regis was no exception. He wouldn\u2019t be able to reason his daughter out of her decision.\u2018Like Mikhail, she\u2019ll probably break up with him once she becomes put off by him.\u2019A little ripple was enough to make her open her eyes. For this reason, Regis planned to slowly reveal Max\u2019s true character to his daughter.\u201cAlright,\u201d he said.Without knowing her father\u2019s ulterior motives, Jubelian smiled brightly. \u201cThank you, Father.\u201dSeeing her innocent face, Regis felt his heart ache.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 this is all to protect you.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Off to a Rocky StartAct 8. Will This Contract Work?\u201cUm, Father. I have something to talk to Max about\u2026 Can we go upstairs?\u201dHe had agreed to wait and keep an eye on us, but was that because he had not allowed us to date yet? He stared at us bitterly and nodded once.\u2018Well, the goal wasn\u2019t to get permission from him anyway.\u2019As far as I was concerned, my goal was to make sure my father gave up on trying to set me up on a blind date with the crown prince. Even if he opposed our relationship, it was enough if he didn\u2019t make me take part in the meeting.\u201cWe\u2019ll be upstairs then.\u201dMy father remained silent at my words.\u2018He must be disappointed in me for what just happened,\u2019\u00a0I sighed without realizing. I was now in a position where I was grateful for not being married off to someone, let alone inherit any of my father\u2019s property.\u2018The only solution left is for me to become independent. Until then, I\u2019ll have to hang in there.\u2019\u00a0With this thought in mind, I walked with Max up to my room. When I arrived, I saw Sella and Mary tidying up.\u201cWhere\u2019s Merilyn?\u201d I asked them.\u201cOh, she\u2019s in the laundry room.\u201d\u2018I guess I have no choice.\u2019I was a little worried since Merilyn was usually in charge of preparing the tea, but said calmly, \u201cPlease bring us tea and cookies for two and use my favorite tea set.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady!\u201d The two maids spoke in unison with determined voices and left the room. I closed the door and turned around.\u2018Now, let\u2019s have a serious discussion about our contract\u2026 What on earth?\u2019I saw him lying comfortably on my couch.\u2018I understand that we\u2019re in a contractual relationship, but we\u2019re supposed to be a couple now. Would it hurt for him to play the part properly?\u2019\u00a0I sighed for a moment, then took out a few sheets of paper and two quill pens.\u201cHey, come here.\u201d Hearing my call, he made his way to the tea table. \u201cSit down.\u201d I gestured to the seat across from me. \u201cRegarding our contract, I was thinking of writing down some terms and conditions. If you want anything from me, write it down here.\u201dAt my words, he picked up a quill pen and began scribbling some things down. I stopped in the middle of my writing and watched him curiously.\u2018He\u2019s left-handed\u2026 and his handwriting is just terrible.\u2019As I was watching in amazement at his writing, he frowned slightly and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s smudged.\u201d The common notational system favored right-handed people. No matter how carefully he wrote, he was going to run into some problems.\u201cHere you go.\u201d I took out a handkerchief from my pocket and handed it to him. Without a word, he grabbed it and started wiping the ink off his hand. Then, he scratched out the smudged part and started writing again. I curiously looked at what he had written and started to chuckle. It stated the following:During the period of this contract, Jubelian will not meet with another man.\u2018I\u2019m in this relationship because I don\u2019t want to meet another man\u2026\u2019At that moment, he asked in an irritated tone, \u201cInstead of laughing at someone else\u2019s terms, why don\u2019t you write yours?\u201dAlthough what he said was true, I decided not to admit it to spare my pride. \u201cIt was interesting, so I was just taking a look,\u201d I said instead.\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting?\u201dUsually, mercenary guilds provided lessons on reading and writing to avoid training pushovers who couldn\u2019t read requests and contracts. \u201cYour handwriting is very freewheeling. Did you learn how to read and write from the guild?\u201d I avoided being direct about his terrible handwriting.\u201cI didn\u2019t learn it in a guild. I learned from my mother,\u201d he frowned. The moment I heard his words, I was overwhelmed with extreme embarrassment.\u2018I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u2019\u00a0He must have been offended by the snarky remark I made about something that he learned from his mother. I swallowed nervously and said, \u201cHey, about what I said just now\u2014\u201dAt that moment, the door opened. \u201cWe\u2019re late, my lady.\u201dI nodded at Mary and Sella to let them know it was okay. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Please set up the table for us.\u201d Soon the table was decorated with appetizing cookies.\u2018Ah, it looks delicious.\u2019When I picked up the teapot and poured tea into the cups, the soft yet slightly bitter scent tickled my nose.\u00a0\u2018Hm, I was concerned about how well the tea would turn out because Merilyn didn\u2019t prepare it, but it seems like they did a good job.\u2019\u00a0I was about to give the maids a quick compliment but groaned slightly when I noticed the teacups they brought in were pink and full of flowers.\u2018Well, it should be fine, right?\u2019\u00a0Since he wasn\u2019t a nobleman, I assumed he wouldn\u2019t know the meaning of the cups. With this thought, I smiled at him.* * *When he saw the teacups, Max doubted his eyes.\u00a0\u2018Did she ask for these cups knowing what they meant?\u2019Expensive teacups were a source of pride, but they were also a measure of how the host or hostess thought of their guests. Costly and valuable teacups containing lots of gold were used with precious guests, and colorful and beautiful teacups were used with noblewomen. For male guests, tea was usually served in cups that did not contain flowers or bright colors.When negotiating over disputes at the border, Max had occasionally faced barbarian lords who expressed their hostility towards him with teacups. Even so, they only used cups with monsters drawn on to make sarcastic remarks about his brutal personality; they had never used colorful cups with flowers like these.\u2018To use teacups like these\u2026\u2019\u00a0She was either trying to insult him, or she didn\u2019t know what they meant.\u00a0\u2018Do I seem weak to her by any chance?\u2019\u00a0When he thought about it, it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable assumption since Jubelian had joked about protecting him before. Max stared at Jubelian with a suspicious look.\u201cOh, these are my favorite teacups,\u201d she said with an innocent voice as if she didn\u2019t know anything. Listening to her, Max stared at the cup again. Although he hated flowers, the gold rim of the cup was luxurious, and the shape was adequate as well. The longer he looked at it, the more he thought that it wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201cIt\u2019s decent,\u201d he commented. At his words, he could see Jubelian smiling with her eyes slightly curved. Max smirked as he brought the cup up to his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Writing the Official Contract\u201cCome on, try it.\u201d At my words, he raised his teacup. I felt strange because his form was elegant while doing so.\u00a0\u2018Hm, that\u2019s a little weird.\u2019\u00a0Tea was an expensive item that not everyone could easily access. It was such a serious matter that the storage boxes that held the tea leaves were locked. As a simple mercenary, he probably rarely had the chance to drink tea. Nevertheless, he was drinking it so naturally. Seeing that, I couldn\u2019t help but feel suspicious.\u00a0\u2018What if\u2026 he\u2019s actually the young master of a noble family who ran away from home?\u2019\u00a0I was becoming a little skeptical of his true identity when he put down the cup.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people drink this,\u201d he coldly said. I almost clicked my tongue in annoyance. In my opinion, the tea was relatively well-brewed, and it was the finest we had, but he was grumbling about it.\u2018Right, there\u2019s no way a nobleman wouldn\u2019t understand the taste of tea.\u2019At that moment, his voice interrupted my thoughts. \u201cHere, take a look.\u201dWhile looking through his terms, I frowned.\u00a0\u2018This guy\u2026 he really wrote down whatever he wanted.\u2019\u00a0Written in his terrible handwriting, the terms were as follows:Jubelian will always trust and follow Max\u2019s words.When Jubelian goes out, she will disclose information about where she is going to Max. When attending a banquet or a meeting, she is obligated to report to Max.During the period of this contract, Jubelian will not meet with another man.Jubelian will spend time with Max for at least eight hours a day, four times a week.I was astounded by the things he wrote down. It looked like something a grumpy, self-centered boss would write.\u00a0\u2018Whenever I ask about him, he\u2019s always telling me that it\u2019s none of my business. However, based on what he\u2019s written here, it seems like he wants to know everything about my private life.\u2019\u00a0I lamented for a moment, then opened my mouth to express my opinion. \u201cHey, do you happen to\u2014\u201d\u201cAdd one more thing: Jubelian should call Max by his name.\u201d I had only learned his name today so there was no way I was already familiar with it. Even so, when I thought of it, I seemed to be calling him by his name every time. I didn\u2019t expect to be criticized for a mistake I made once.\u201cThen will you\u2014I mean, Max\u2014call me by my name from now on as well?\u201dHe paused, then nodded gently. \u201cOkay.\u201dI glanced at him then started to write a revised version of his terms.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s so terrible that I don\u2019t know where to start.\u2019\u00a0I scratched out some of his writings and wrote down the revisions on a new piece of paper.The employer is obligated to comply with the employee\u2019s requests as much as possible.The employer and employee are to respect each other\u2019s privacy.\u00a0In the case of either party\u2019s absence, the employer and employee are obligated to report their locations to each other.During the period of this contract, the employer and employee are not allowed to pursue a romantic relationship with another person.\u00a0The employee will watch their words and actions in front of others.\u00a0Locations for dates shall be determined upon agreement, but if possible, they shall be places with a large number of people.The above terms and conditions specify that the contract may be terminated by mutual consent and may be subject to change depending on the circumstances.The contract will be completed once Jubelian feels safe from the crown prince.Employer: Jubelian Eloy FloyenEmployee: MaxAfter finishing the revisions, I pushed the paper towards him. \u201cHere. Read this and tell me if any changes need to be made.\u201dHe snatched the paper from me and squinted his eyes. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the changes I made to the original. Read it over carefully and tell me if you don\u2019t like\u2014\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t accept this,\u201d he said as he tore up the contract.I took a deep breath.\u00a0\u2018Did he just tear up what I wrote?\u2019\u00a0If he didn\u2019t like it, he could have just told me. Seeing how he tore it up, I could now tell that he was definitely not a normal person.\u00a0\u2018Yes, now that I think about it, he has always been like that.\u2019\u00a0Even when I took care of him for a few days, he left without notice and without answering me. He also seemed to be frequently irritated. No matter how much I advocated a free lifestyle, I at least knew how to respect others. It was called social skills. It was for this reason that I had been considerate to him so he wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable around me. However, this man had lacked regard for me from the very beginning until now.\u2018We\u2019ll have to see each other more often from now on\u2026\u2019\u00a0I had overlooked his rude behavior in the past because I knew we weren\u2019t going to encounter each other very often. But since we were now in a contractual relationship, we were going to meet more frequently. If we were already hitting a rough patch, then the next step was obvious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Writing the Official Contract\u201cIf you\u2019re that against it, then I guess it can\u2019t be helped. Let\u2019s end our contract here.\u201dMax doubted his ears when he heard what Jubelian said. \u201cWhat do you mean? I thought you were trying to avoid becoming engaged to the crown prince.\u201dJubelian stared at him coldly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. If we can\u2019t work out anything at the start\u2026 it\u2019s just going to be exhausting for us to keep going.\u201d The desperation Max saw in her a few moments ago was nowhere to be found. She only had a distant look on her face and seemed to have let go of everything. Max\u2019s throat suddenly felt like it was burning and dry. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty,\u201d he managed to let out.\u201cWhat do you mean hasty?\u201d Jubelian sighed quietly. \u201cYou tore up the contract, which means you don\u2019t want to compromise.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d Max\u2019s lips twitched. Throughout his time as the crown prince, he tore up any documents he didn\u2019t like. When he did so, his aides knew to write up a new one that was to his liking. No one had ever pointed out that tearing up the papers was wrong. They only apologized for writing an inadequate report. For this reason, Max couldn\u2019t understand Jubelian.\u00a0\u2018Can\u2019t she just write another one and bring it to me?\u2019\u00a0he wondered in confusion.\u201cDo you feel good when someone ignores your opinion?\u201d Jubelian asked suddenly.\u201c\u2026\u201dJubelian sighed at his silence, and continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for other people. When someone ignores my opinion, it hurts my pride and makes me feel unpleasant.\u201dWas it because his surroundings were quiet? He could hear her voice exceptionally well.\u00a0\u2018Is that so?\u2019\u00a0His aides and subordinates worked for him as if it were the natural thing to do, and Max used them in return. It was the way things were since he was of a higher status. \u201cSo, are you saying that you\u2019re offended?\u201d he asked with a dull voice.Jubelian nodded with a calm expression. \u201cYes. In all honesty, it didn\u2019t feel good.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m the one helping her, but she still looks confident.\u2019\u00a0For an unknown reason, Max decided to keep his mouth shut.\u201cBut since you didn\u2019t like what I had written, I thought it would be best to call it quits here. Besides, I\u2019m the one asking you for a favor.\u201d He began to sulk at her words. He knew that if he was stubborn here then he might never see her again.\u2018Who would be afraid of something like that? It doesn\u2019t matter to\u2026\u2019\u00a0Before he could finish his thought, his mouth betrayed him. \u201cJust now, that was my fault,\u201d he apologized.* * *It felt weird to see him apologizing so meekly. Just a while ago, he was the person who insisted on not apologizing to my father. \u201cGood. As long as you know.\u201d Surprisingly, the negotiation was easy since his frustrations were because of trivial issues.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t believe he acted like that because I didn\u2019t include the thing about calling him by his name\u2026\u2019\u00a0I held back a sigh and showed him the contract.\u201cHere. Is this what you wanted?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d With his confirmation, I wrote another copy and handed it to him.\u201cSign here,\u201d I instructed. He paused and swallowed nervously.\u2018Does he not have a signature?\u2019\u00a0I wondered. But he soon picked up his quill pen again and signed awkwardly.\u00a0\u2018Seems like he made one not too long ago,\u2019\u00a0I supposed and let go of my ridiculous speculation.\u00a0\u2018It could be because he didn\u2019t have a lot of situations where he had to sign before.\u2019\u201cBy the way,\u201d his voice interrupted my thoughts, \u201cwill you be\u2026 attending any banquets soon?\u201d\u201cAh, I plan to attend a tea party in the near future.\u201dHe stared at me for a while, then nodded with a sigh. \u201cI see. Do you know who will be attending the party?\u201d\u201cJust noblewomen who are acquaintances of my acquaintance.\u201dHe had a serious expression on his face. \u201cWill it really only be noblewomen who are attending?\u201d\u201cYes, I already told you. Why do you keep\u2026 Oh!\u201d Suddenly, a great idea crossed my mind.\u00a0\u2018Good. I can make sure everyone sees him sooner.\u2019\u00a0In the past, I troubled myself with rumors because I feared what my father thought of me. But now that he was trying to marry me off to the crazy crown prince, I no longer cared about whether or not I had a good image. I actually thought it would be useful for me to have a bad public image if I wanted to be an unfit candidate for the crown prince\u2019s bride. With this thought in mind, I asked, \u201cMax, could you take me there that day?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cAh, I just want to introduce you to others as my boyfriend. That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d I smiled at him. His eyebrows slightly furrowed and he wore a strange expression on his face as if he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cOf course, you can refuse if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I reassured him.He nodded slowly. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll come get you when it\u2019s over.\u201d I was about to nod in return but stopped.\u2018I don\u2019t know if he has any nice clothes.\u2019\u00a0Honestly, it was enough for me to confirm the false rumors that said I was dating an unidentified man. It didn\u2019t matter what he wore. However, as the saying goes, \u2018what looks good, tastes good,\u2019 I wanted to dress him up and show him off.\u00a0\u2018Since he\u2019s helping me\u2026 the least I can do is buy some clothes for him. I\u2019ll buy him all the clothes he wants.\u2019\u00a0Making my decision, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go shopping tomorrow.\u201d I could see his face slightly scrunch up at my words. I smiled at him.\u00a0\u2018Since I\u2019m going through the trouble of dressing him up, I should do it well so everyone can see how handsome he is.\u2019* * *\u201cHey, Max. Could you turn around?\u201dMax let out a sigh. Having already tried on dozens of outfits, he was beginning to feel like a child\u2019s doll. The owner of the clothes shop fawned over him while wearing a huge smile.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone who suits the clothing so well.\u201d Such nonsense was probably meant as a compliment, but for Max, it was an extremely irritating remark.\u2018How much longer do I have to put up with this?\u2019\u00a0His face was scrunched up in annoyance until he looked over at Jubelian who was smiling with satisfaction.\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s said that \u2018a good face makes good fashion.\u2019 I can see what that means now,\u201d she agreed. Although her words were meant to judge him, he found that he wasn\u2019t angry. Instead, he felt an odd tickle in his heart, and the corners of his mouth turned upwards. Nonetheless, Max couldn\u2019t help but frown slightly at what Jubelian said next.\u201cOh, do you have anything a little more colorful than this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - My Preferences or Yours?Max\u2019s closet was full of neutral colors. His casual clothes, dress suits, and even the armor he wore on the battlefield were all black, which clearly showed his preferences.\u00a0\u2018Alright, it\u2019s too early to jump to conclusions.\u2019\u00a0He decided to wait and see the clothing first before making a judgment.\u00a0\u2018What is that hideous thing?\u2019\u00a0Seeing the clothes that the seamstress brought out, Max freaked out. She had brought out a red justaucorps that was embroidered with gold. The outfit was noticeable from a distance and far from his taste.\u201cI don\u2019t like this\u2026\u201d he tried to refuse but stopped when he saw Jubelian staring at him with glistening eyes.\u201cWould you like to try it on?\u201d Even though it was only a suggestion, Max couldn\u2019t bring himself to say no. After he put on the clothes, the seamstress started to fawn over him again.\u201cWow, it really suits you.\u201dMax frowned while looking in the mirror.\u00a0\u2018Is this okay?\u2019\u00a0After his mother\u2019s death, Max had stopped wearing such colorful clothing. Maybe that was why his appearance seemed strange to him.\u201cWhat do you think? Do you like it?\u201d Caught up in the confusion of the moment, he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I was worried since it was more of my taste.\u201d She smiled brightly. Max felt strange when he heard her say the word \u2018taste.\u2019 He took another glance at himself in the mirror and found that he looked better than he initially thought.\u201cMax,\u201d Jubelian calmly called him. Without him noticing, she had approached him and was now gazing at him with her jewel-like eyes. Max could feel his heart pounding under her stare. \u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201d Max gently took her fine hand that she held out and heard a soft whisper. \u201cThe clothes are a gift from me.\u201dUnder normal circumstances, he wouldn\u2019t have accepted such a thing, even if it was a gift. However, he remembered her words,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I was worried since it was more of my taste.\u201d\u00a0Because of this, he decided to show generosity and accept her gift.* * *\u2018I\u2019m worn out.\u2019\u00a0As I was visiting the various shops on Arcade Street with Max, I could feel multiple stares on us. I turned to the main source of all the attention.\u00a0\u2018He was handsome in just a dark cape, but now that he\u2019s dressed up, he was something else.\u2019\u00a0It is said that \u2018fine clothes make the man,\u2019 however, in this case, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the clothes were benefiting from him.\u00a0\u2018How could a face like that not be mentioned in the original novel?\u2019\u00a0My expression hardened as I blamed the author for the strange setup of the characters.\u201cOh, who\u2019s this? If it isn\u2019t Lady Floyen!\u201d a voice called out.\u201cAh, long time no see, Esteemed son of Viscount Droil,\u201d I replied.Grinning, he slyly approached and bowed at my words. \u201cThe noble lady is beautiful today, as always.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWe were exchanging casual greetings when he said, \u201cBut the person next to you\u2026 is someone I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Since he attended many parties, it was obvious that he would know most of the public figures who lived in the capital. It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for him to be curious about someone he didn\u2019t recognize.\u2018Well, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter anymore if rumors spread.\u2019\u00a0My goal was to avoid getting married off to the crown prince. To have met Radian, who was a very talkative person, I guess I was lucky. \u201cThis is my boyfriend, Max.\u201dAt my words, a strange glow appeared in Radian\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh, if you don\u2019t mind, could you tell me which family he\u2019s from?\u201dI tried to give a vague answer, but Max spoke up before I had the chance. \u201cThat is none of your business.\u201dI sighed at his cold words.\u00a0\u2018Ah, this guy\u2026 is going to cause trouble after all.\u2019* * *The greedy gaze that was looking Jubelian up and down was not an unfamiliar sight to Max. As someone who grew up in the palace and roamed the battlefield, he recognized the look as greed and the desire to conquer. He became inexplicably angry when he realized this.\u00a0\u2018How dare someone like him\u2026\u2019\u00a0He didn\u2019t know why, but he wanted to twist the insolent man\u2019s neck. Nevertheless, he held himself back because of Jubelian\u2019s eyes that seemed to be telling him to be patient. Looking at her periwinkle eyes, the feelings that overwhelmed him strangely subsided. It was similar to the peace he felt when he first fell asleep in her room. Max clenched his fists and suppressed his murderous intent.\u00a0\u2018Why on earth am I holding myself back?\u2019\u00a0While he was questioning himself about his unexplainable actions, Jubelian spoke.\u201cAh, my boyfriend is from the countryside far away from here, so he\u2019s not well versed on the manners here. I hope you understand.\u201dMax narrowed his eyes at her calm voice.\u00a0\u2018I finished learning manners when I was nine years old.\u2019\u00a0For the royal family, etiquette and manners were only means of seeing if one person was acting improperly to another. By the way Radian was acting, Max could tell that he was being rude.\u00a0\u2018How dare a mere son of a viscount talk this way to the daughter of a duke?\u2019\u00a0Max gripped his fists even harder, the blue veins on the back of his hand becoming more prominent. He sent Radian a warning glare, but the man with snake-like eyes didn\u2019t appear even a little intimidated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - My Preferences or Yours?\u201cI see. Now that the lady has a new lover, a lot of gentlemen in the capital will be heartbroken.\u201d The conniving man winked and laughed. \u201cShould I mention that I, of course, will be one of them?\u201d Max could tell Radian was looking down on him by the way he eyed him while smiling crookedly.\u2018How amusing.\u2019\u00a0When he participated in the war at the age of 16, there were many times where he was ignored for being a rookie. However, that stopped being the case when he cut off the enemy commander\u2019s head and displayed it in the square for all to see. Since the beginning, he was someone who never avoided a fight.\u00a0\u2018Will he still be able to look at me the same when his tongue is cut off?\u2019\u00a0His mind was starting to fill with brutal thoughts, but when Jubelian suddenly locked arms with him, his anger started to fade.\u00a0\u2018What is she doing?\u2019\u00a0As if to answer Max\u2019s question, Jubelian parted her red lips.\u201cWe\u2019ll be going, then. We\u2019re running short on time for a date.\u201dMax\u2019s expression relaxed at her words.\u00a0\u2018A date\u2026?\u2019\u00a0Although he had taken part in an unwanted dress-up, her words confirmed for him who she was spending time with. When he realized this, an unfamiliar feeling that was both warm and ticklish started bubbling in his chest.\u201cI hope you\u2019ll allow me some time next time,\u201d the man\u2019s voice broke the stillness. Max smirked at Radian who continued his act up until the end.\u2018Son of Viscount Droil, huh.\u2019\u00a0As he watched Radian walk away, Max made a vow to place Viscount Droil\u2019s family on the hit list once the day of the rebellion came around.\u00a0\u2018The first thing I\u2019ll do is rip off that mouth that dared to laugh at me.\u2019Max\u2019s eyes were shining with bloodthirst when Jubelian suddenly asked, \u201cDo you want to get something sweet to eat?\u201dClearing the savagery from his eyes, Max glanced over at her.\u201cI\u2019m just stressed out from seeing that irksome guy,\u201d she explained.He wasn\u2019t sure what the phrase \u2018stressed out\u2019 meant, but he did understand that she was speaking ill of Radian. \u201cThen we can get rid of him, right? As the daughter of a duke, it will be simple to exterminate a viscount\u2019s family.\u201dAt his words, Jubelian let out a sigh and hardened her expression. \u201cI really hate him, but I don\u2019t want to get rid of him.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Jubelian sighed again at Max\u2019s oblivious tone.\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 I hate rats, but I don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of killing them just to see their dead bodies. Do you know what I mean?\u201dMax learned something important from her words.\u00a0\u2018I see she doesn\u2019t like killing.\u2019\u00a0For some reason, he became depressed at this thought.\u00a0\u2018Is this why she\u2019s afraid of the crown prince?\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about unpleasant things and get some sweets. I know a good place.\u201d Jubelian\u2019s lively voice brought him back to reality.Max stared at her in return.\u00a0\u2018I hate sweet things.\u2019\u00a0Mistaking his silence for affirmation, Jubelian began pulling on his arm.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it.\u201d If he wanted to, he could have refused, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, Max allowed himself to be helplessly dragged along.They soon arrived at an indescribably glamorous tearoom. Jubelian looked over to Max as if she were expecting some sort of reaction, but he was indifferent.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s average,\u2019\u00a0he thought. No matter how colorful the interior was, it was mediocre in the eyes of someone who grew up in a palace full of gold.\u201cHello, my lady. What would you like to order?\u201d When the clerk brought out the menu, Jubelian looked over to Max.\u201cWhat do you like? I like strawberry cake.\u201d To be honest, he hated sweets, but he felt that if he told her the truth then her smile would disappear.\u201cI want the same thing,\u201d he said instead.\u201cI think you and I have similar tastes.\u201d Max slightly furrowed his eyebrows at her words.\u2018They\u2019re completely different.\u2019\u00a0Cucumbers, showy clothes, and sweets were all things he hated. This whole time he had been shaping himself to like what she liked of his own accord, but the other party hadn\u2019t noticed it so far.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s amazing how dense she is,\u2019\u00a0Max sighed in frustration.* * *Mikhail\u2019s expression twisted into one of irritation when he laid his eyes on the face of someone who he didn\u2019t want to see. \u201cWhat brings you here again?\u201dRadian lifted a glass at his question. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down first and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d He was extremely displeased to see how Radian used the excuse of him being his cousin to drink his expensive alcohol. Instead of sitting down, Mikhail picked up the glass of liquor on the table.\u2018You don\u2019t want to talk to me face to face, do you?\u2019\u00a0Radian smirked at his cousin\u2019s obvious behavior. \u201cDid you know?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Whatever his vile cousin had to say, Mikhail was determined to not be shaken up this time. With this pledge in mind, he began to bring the glass to his mouth.\u201cLady Floyen, I saw her with a man today.\u201dWhen he heard those absurd words, the glass slipped from Mikhail\u2019s hand.\u00a0Clang!\u00a0There was a loud rupture followed by pieces of glass rolling on the floor. Radian opened his mouth to say something but closed it when he noticed the look in his cousin\u2019s eyes.\u201cI dare you to say something like that again.\u201d Mikhail\u2019s bleak voice cut through the silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - Tea Time With the LadiesMikhail paused while wiping his dripping face with a towel.\u201cI definitely saw it. She was with some handsome guy,\u201d Radian had said.\u2018My God, there\u2019s no way that woman would do something like that.\u2019\u00a0He thought when he heard a knock on the door.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re scheduled to attend the Terence family\u2019s tea party today\u2014 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware. I\u2019ll be ready on time, so you can leave.\u201dMikhail gritted his teeth after sending away his servant who came to remind him of his agenda.\u00a0\u2018A new lover? That doesn\u2019t make sense. Radian must be speaking nonsense like he did last time.\u2019\u00a0Thinking back on the time Radian made false rumors about the cufflinks, Mikhail observed himself in the mirror. His face had become thinner, but it was still attractive. \u2018If she sees me today, I\u2019m sure she will\u2026\u2019\u00a0Mikhail clenched his fists, unable to finish his thoughts.* * *On the morning of the tea tasting party, I spun around in front of the mirror while wearing the new dress I ordered from the dress shop. Maybe it was because I had the cumbersome frill sleeves replaced with short puff sleeves that it was easier to move my arms around. I also had the top of the stomacher changed to expose less of my upper body since I had always been concerned about that.\u00a0\u2018Hm, this should be okay, right?\u2019\u00a0I wondered.The fashion trend in the novel significantly changed after Princess Beatrice showed up to her coming-of-age ceremony in a dress that had a much larger than usual pannier. Unlike the splendor that the princess sought, the dress I was currently wearing was completely different. The whalebone pannier was replaced with a petticoat made of several layers of cloth and the long sleeves were replaced with short puff sleeves. These were only slight improvements to the uncomfortable Rococo style clothing.\u2018If I could, I would like to wear something more comfortable, but I\u2019ll become an eyesore if I stick out too much\u2026 I\u2019ll just wear whatever I want after I become independent.\u2019\u00a0I thought when I heard Merilyn\u2019s voice.\u201cMy lady, there\u2019s a guest waiting.\u201d I nodded at her words knowing that she was talking about Max.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d I said and glanced at the clock.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s an hour earlier than expected\u2026\u2019\u00a0I admired his diligence when Merilyn spoke up again.\u201cAnd this is an allowance from the master.\u201dI sighed at my father\u2019s unexpected surprise.\u00a0\u2018That\u2019s a relief. I was worried about losing my allowance. But\u2026\u2019\u00a0In this situation, it probably wasn\u2019t enough for my father to cut off my allowance and kick me out. Honestly, I didn\u2019t understand why my father was acting this way.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll think about this later, I have things to do today.\u2019\u00a0Ignoring my thoughts, I sighed again and left the room.\u2018That man. He didn\u2019t dress weirdly, did he?\u2019\u00a0With this question in mind, I went down the stairs and was impressed by the sight that greeted me.\u00a0\u2018Wow.\u2019\u00a0His usually messy black hair looked neat today as if he had decided to dress up. On top of that, he was wearing the clothes I bought for him along with some accessories that matched perfectly.\u2018He\u2019s already a stunning person, but now that he\u2019s dressed up\u2026 he\u2019s no joke.\u2019\u00a0He was definitely a handsome guy who could catch anyone\u2019s eyes. While I stared blankly at him, I noticed something strange.\u00a0\u2018Why is he staring at me like that?\u2019\u00a0The thought popped up in my head when I felt his piercing gaze.\u00a0\u2018Does he think I look weird?\u2019\u00a0I gazed back at him.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said coldly as he quickly turned his head.\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t expect anything in the first place.\u2019* * *Although her dress was simpler than usual, it had greatly increased her pure and innocent aura. Like the servants in the mansion who saw her, Max was hardly able to take his eyes off of her.\u2018She looks different than normal today.\u2019\u00a0Whenever Max saw her, his face would heat up and his heart would start to pound uncontrollably. Afraid that she might notice, he kept his gaze fixed out the window when he boarded the carriage. Soon after, he heard Jubelian\u2019s breathing become even. Max frowned and turned his head towards her.\u2018Is she\u2026 asleep?\u2019\u00a0He noticed it before, but she was the very definition of defenseless.\u00a0\u2018She doesn\u2019t do this in front of anyone else, does she?\u2019\u00a0Max thought as he glanced sideways at Jubelian. After a while, the corners of his lips turned upwards.\u00a0\u2018What a sight to behold.\u2019\u00a0Seeing Jubelian nodding off while sleeping was somehow both precarious and funny.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019ll be worth seeing if she ends up falling forwards.\u2019\u00a0At that moment, a big movement caused Jubelian\u2019s head to shake as Max\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. Before he could even think about it, his body had moved and he was now supporting her head with his hands.\u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019\u00a0His face scrunched up as he mulled over his actions. Max laid Jubelian\u2019s head on his shoulder as he tried to rationalize his behavior.\u00a0\u2018Well, it was pretty annoying to see her nodding off like that.\u2019\u00a0Unlike before when her head was shaking dangerously, she now looked stable leaning against him with her eyes closed. Max recalled Fresia\u2019s report as he felt her warmth spread to him.\u201cI heard that Lady Terence invited Sir Mikhail on her own accord and did not notify the other ladies about this.\u201d\u2018Mikhail.\u2019\u00a0For no reason, he began to feel unpleasant when he thought about this name.\u00a0\u2018Until the misunderstandings are cleared, I can\u2019t let that bugger bother her.\u2019\u00a0Max scowled.\u201cMm, huh\u2026?\u201d Jubelian, who had just woken up, looked at him with a puzzled expression. He felt heat creep up the back of his neck when he saw her defenseless face.\u201cKeep sleeping,\u201d he said as he turned back to the window. It was better when he couldn\u2019t see her face.\u201cAlright, thank you,\u201d she replied in a pleasant voice. At that, a faint smile made its way onto Max\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Tea Time With the LadiesLady Terence\u2019s drawing room, where the tea tasting party was scheduled to take place, was filled with a chilly atmosphere. \u201cIt seems there\u2019s an uninvited guest. I would like to know what\u2019s going on, Veronica.\u201d\u201cI was only following the rule of our meetings that stated whoever provides the place for the party is free to invite guests.\u201d At Veronica\u2019s sarcastic reply, Rose raised her voice.\u201cThe other day I mentioned clearly that a unanimous agreement was needed. I\u2019d like to ask you why you did this without our permission.\u201dInstead of Veronica\u2019s answer, another voice interjected quietly. \u201cIf that is the case, I\u2019m told that Lady Rose also broke the rules. Being strict on others while being merciful to yourself doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d With a bit of spite in her purple eyes, Rose glared at Mikhail.\u2018I have no idea why he came here, but I know it wasn\u2019t for a good reason.\u2019\u00a0Before Rose could refute him, another voice spoke.\u201cSir Mikhail certainly has a point.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a difference, does it? Since there are two exceptional guests,\u201d another voice agreed. The ladies\u2019 eyes were on Mikhail\u2019s handsome face. Realizing what they were thinking, Rose\u2019s face twisted up in annoyance.\u2018What? They ended up falling for that man\u2019s face! Those traitors!\u2019\u00a0She was shaking and unable to hide her anger when the door to the drawing room opened. The arguing came to a stop as the members of the tea party were shocked by who arrived.\u201cOh, I arrived on time\u2026 but it seems you all came early.\u201d Rose couldn\u2019t bring herself to say hello. Jubelian was dressed in a white dress that had puff sleeves instead of the normal long sleeves. She looked pure and thin like a small, fragile white bird. But what really made her shine was the man next to her. He had chilling red eyes and his black hair contrasted perfectly with her white skin. Overall, he had a handsome appearance, but his sharp and fierce aura made it difficult for one to approach him. One could say that they gave each other a complementary effect. With such a contrasting man next to her, Jubelian\u2019s white and fragile aura became more prominent.\u2018She looks like a princess of a kingdom and he looks like a handsome evil king who kidnapped her,\u2019\u00a0Rose thought as she recalled a romance novel she read in the past. She came to her senses when she noticed she had been blankly staring at them. \u201cExcuse my manners, Lady Floyen, but who might the person next to you be\u2026?\u201d she carefully asked.Jubelian smiled at Rose\u2019s question. \u201cOh, this is my boyfriend, Max.\u201dThe ladies at the tea party became surprised and started whispering amongst themselves. \u201cWait a minute, a boyfriend? I thought the rumors about you having a lover were false\u2026\u201dSuddenly, everyone\u2019s eyes turned to Mikhail. His beautiful face, which was once relaxed, was now distorted in a look of irritation.\u00a0\u2018Was the crap that Radian talked about actually true?\u2019\u00a0He showed a bitter smile as he clenched his fists tightly.\u00a0\u2018No, this is probably a trick to make me jealous.\u2019\u00a0He looked to the man next to Jubelian.\u00a0\u2018He has a decent face, but judging from the way she only said his first name he must be from a lowly family or\u2026 a commoner.\u2019Mikhail wanted to remove the unpleasant man from her side and trample him. However, as an aristocrat, there was no reason for him to take care of a person who was of lowly status.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s just trying to provoke me with some guy from a nobody\u2019s family\u2026 but that won\u2019t work.\u2019\u00a0He scowled and decided,\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll make sure your patience runs out today, Jubelian.\u2019* * *I knew Max was definitely a handsome guy with all the attention he attracted. While I, on the other hand, who was wearing such simple clothing, was lucky to not look incomparable next to him.\u00a0\u2018Well, it can\u2019t be helped. I chose convenience over beauty and offered him the contract.\u2019\u00a0I resigned myself to this fact when a member of the tea party spoke to me.\u201cUm, Lady Floyen, about your dress\u2026\u201d\u2018Ugh, is she going to point out that my dress is shabby?\u2019\u00a0Since my attire was neither trendy nor fancy, I was afraid she might have thought it lowered the class of the tea party.\u201cYou look so elegant and pretty in it!\u201d She finished with a blush.The lady next to her nodded in agreement. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, could you tell me which dress shop you ordered it from?\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019\u00a0I was embarrassed by their unexpected words, then realized their true intentions.\u00a0\u2018Oh, are they afraid of embarrassing me for wearing inadequate clothing?\u2019\u00a0Feeling a bit of gratitude towards them, I gladly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s from Lily Muge\u2019s dress shop.\u201d\u201cOh my goodness, thank you!\u201d I was relieved by their hospitality when I noticed a familiar face.\u2018Wait, how is that person\u2026?\u2019\u00a0I was flustered to see this person again, especially here of all places.\u201cI just think these dresses won\u2019t suit you well because of your slender figure, Lady Floyen. If trends weren\u2019t so important, you wouldn\u2019t have to wear uncomfortable dresses that don\u2019t even look good on you. It\u2019s simply\u2026 a shame,\u201d\u00a0she had said.\u2018The lady I saw at the dress shop\u2026 I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s here. What a wonderful coincidence!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - An Unwelcome GuestMaybe it was because I felt a sense of closeness from her, but I was somehow glad to see her. I slightly nodded at her, but she faintly turned her head away from me as if she didn\u2019t see me and started whispering to the person sitting next to her. I instantly looked over and almost narrowed my eyes at who I saw.\u00a0\u2018Why is Mikhail here\u2026?\u2019If someone were to ask me to describe how I felt about seeing my ex-boyfriend at a meeting with my friends, which I diligently dressed up for, I would simply say,\u00a0\u2018Hm, I don\u2019t really feel anything.\u2019\u00a0Was it because I didn\u2019t have any regrets? Honestly, I was flustered that no one had told me that he would be here, but that was it. Even when I looked at his face, I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u2018But he might be uncomfortable around me\u2026\u2019\u00a0I turned my attention elsewhere, thinking that I should stay quiet so we don\u2019t bump into each other.\u201cLong time no see, Jubelian,\u201d Mikhail said in a gentle voice. Maybe it was because it had been a while since our breakup or because he was feeling joyous after being freed from me, but Mikhail had a relaxed expression on his slightly thin face.\u2018Hm, is it okay for him to see me like this now?\u2019\u00a0I thought, then quickly denied this speculation.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s probably doing that because of what other people might think.\u2019\u00a0As expected from the novel\u2019s male protagonist, he had a very good image. He was gentle, kind, and well-mannered. It was probably because of this that he couldn\u2019t draw a strict line between us.\u2018I\u2019ll just have to draw the line for him then,\u2019\u00a0I decided. Since my image was already ruined because of my past and because my father was already upset with me, I didn\u2019t care if it got worse at this point. To be honest, I didn\u2019t want to be nice to Mikhail.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while,\u201d I replied indifferently. My voice came out so emotionless and robotic that I couldn\u2019t believe it was me. I didn\u2019t want to look at him any longer, so I turned to Max who was sitting next to me.\u2018Hm, he doesn\u2019t look very happy,\u2019\u00a0I noted as I studied Max\u2019s expression. It seemed that he was displeased with something, and I decided that he was uncomfortable with this situation.\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a little while,\u201d I said to Max, implying that he should go back to the carriage and rest. He gave me a vacant gaze in return and opened his mouth to speak. I naturally became anxious, afraid that he might start complaining to me in front of other people.\u201cHave a good time\u2026 my lady,\u201d he replied with a pleasant, low-toned voice. My eyes widened. Although he almost spoke informally out of habit, what he said instead was an unexpected gift for me. I couldn\u2019t hold back my laughter from his praiseworthy behavior.\u201cOh yes, thank you,\u201d I said as he began to turn away.\u201cUm, wait a minute!\u201d a voice suddenly called out. Everyone\u2019s attention turned to Rose who was blushing in embarrassment as she stopped Max from leaving. \u201cI\u2019d like to make a suggestion. Since there is already an unexpected guest at our party today, I think it would be fine to add one more person\u2026\u201d she trailed off.I was surprised at Rose\u2019s sudden suggestion.\u00a0\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s okay\u2026\u2019\u00a0Even though he had done a great job just now, I honestly couldn\u2019t trust Max. He was like a ticking time bomb and I had no way of knowing when he was going to explode. Moreover, small gatherings like this tend to avoid uninvited guests. I could tell that the idea wasn\u2019t going to be welcomed, and there was no need to buy criticism from others. I decided to reject Rose\u2019s proposal. \u201cOh, thank you for your consideration, but\u2014\u201d\u201cYes, I agree,\u201d one lady interrupted.\u201cI agree as well,\u201d another spoke up.I scrunched my eyes at the unexpected flow of events.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s okay even though he\u2019s an outsider?\u2019\u00a0I was amazed. I wasn\u2019t expecting the aristocratic people gathered here to be so inclusive and tolerant!\u00a0\u2018Well, if they\u2019re nice enough to say the dress that Max frowned at is pretty\u2026\u2019\u00a0I was trying to come up with a way to avoid this unexpected situation when someone spoke up and saved me.\u201cI disagree.\u201d Ironically, it was Mikhail who stubbornly refused the idea. \u201cDon\u2019t you already have an exception on your side?\u201d he continued while staring at me coldly. It was true that I was an exception, but it was absurd for him to say those things. Nevertheless, instead of retorting, I stayed quiet and welcomed his opinion.\u201cIsn\u2019t it different? In the case of Lady Floyen, I received everyone\u2019s consent in advance,\u201d Rose objected. Even though I appreciated her willingness to take my side, I was frustrated since I wanted Max to leave.\u2018Oh, what am I going to do?\u2019\u00a0I sighed. Three people have already said it was okay for Max to stay and Mikhail seemed to be the only person opposing. At this rate, I would have to take care of Max throughout the tea party.Then someone, who had been silent from the beginning, opened her mouth. \u201cI disagree as well. Any favoritism that goes against fairness will only put Lady Floyen in an awkward situation. Please refrain from acting in such a way, Rose.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - An Unwelcome GuestShe was the noblewoman I met at the dress shop, who I didn\u2019t know the name of. Although her intentions for opposing were unknown, things turned out well again thanks to her.\u2018I really think we have similar personalities.\u2019\u00a0I thought about her favorable impression before speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s as the two of them said. I\u2019m simply thrilled to have been invited to this place.\u201d At my euphemistic refusal, Rose gazed at me with a disappointed expression.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d she began. Worried that I may have hurt her feelings, I decided to show my gratitude.\u201cThank you for being considerate towards my boyfriend. However, since he used to live in the countryside, he is not used to these kinds of meetings,\u201d I explained.\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d\u201cYes, for that reason, I think it would be best for him to go rest in the carriage, right?\u201d I glanced at Max, but he was glaring at me with an unsatisfied look.\u00a0\u2018Did this man get triggered by something again? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019\u00a0I was doing my best to hint at Max who was acting like a rebellious child when the lady who I didn\u2019t know the name of spoke again.\u201cWell, since he\u2019s Lady Floyen\u2019s partner and there are plenty of empty rooms\u2026 I\u2019ll give him a place to stay while he waits.\u201d At her kindness, I was finally able to figure out who she was.\u201cThank you, Lady Terence,\u201d I said.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d she answered with a blank face. Her cool personality only made me like her even more.* * *Recalling what just happened, Veronica scrunched her face.\u00a0\u2018What\u2019s the big deal about a guy with a decent appearance that it\u2019s making everyone hint at me?\u2019\u00a0She didn\u2019t want to give a man with an unclear status a room, but there was no helping it. She was afraid Lady Floyen would get angry if she didn\u2019t do so.\u2018He\u2019s just a petty commoner. How stupid,\u2019\u00a0she thought. However, when she thought about Max\u2019s appearance, Veronica could feel her face getting hot. She hurriedly looked towards Mikhail. Even though he looked a little fatigued, that only served to highlight his beautiful features.\u00a0\u2018As I thought, he\u2019s not as good-looking as Sir Mikhail, but\u2026\u2019\u00a0Veronica\u2019s eyes narrowed when she saw the person Mikhail was staring at.\u00a0\u2018As expected, she\u2019s making Sir Mikhail uncomfortable.\u2019At that moment, she heard a gentle voice. \u201cLady Veronica, the tea smells wonderful.\u201d Mikhail smiled at her.Veronica replied with a blush, \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad you like it.\u201dMikhail, who was smiling at Veronica, glanced over at Jubelian for a reaction.\u00a0\u2018She must be envying Veronica by now, right?\u2019\u00a0Sure enough, he could see Jubelian sighing while looking at them. The corners of Mikhail\u2019s mouth raised at the sight.\u00a0\u2018I knew it. No matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t escape from my grasp.\u2019* * *I unconsciously let out a sigh when I saw Lady Terence blushing.\u00a0\u2018Out of all people, why did she end up liking Mikhail?\u2019\u00a0I wanted to stop her from falling into Mikhail\u2019s evil influence. Since he was destined to love the princess, he was not being genuine towards her. In the end, the only thing that would be left for Lady Terence was destruction.\u00a0\u2018Yes, just like what happened to Jubelian in the original novel.\u2019\u00a0As I sympathized with the woman who was following in my past self\u2019s footsteps, I took a sip of tea and almost frowned.\u2018Um, I don\u2019t think this tea was brewed correctly\u2026\u2019\u00a0From the scent and color, I could tell it was white tea, but it had become slightly bitter from the use of hot water. I thought about saying something but decided to keep my mouth shut.\u00a0\u2018I will only hurt her feelings if I say something.\u2019\u00a0Just as I had in the past, I knew she wouldn\u2019t listen to what others say to her. The only thing left for me to do now was to pray for her.\u00a0\u2018Please do not walk on the path to becoming a villainess.\u2019\u00a0I wished for a safe breakup between her and Mikhail as I drank the bitter tea.* * *\u201cYou can wait here,\u201d the servant said. Max had been led to another drawing room in the count\u2019s house.\u00a0\u2018To ask a member of the royal family to stay in such a shabby place\u2026\u2019\u00a0Max silently complained, then tried to stop himself when he realized the room was filled with luxurious furniture and interior accessories. However, when he recalled Mikhail, who had annoyed him from the start, he became furious.\u201cLong time no see, Jubelian,\u201d\u00a0Mikhail had said. Contrary to the rumors which stated that Mikhail considered Jubelian a bothersome existence, his eyes that stared at her were stained with immense obsession. When that gaze reached Max, it turned cold. It was as if he was warning him to stay away from what was his.\u2018How dare he look at me like that.\u2019\u00a0Max\u2019s eyes filled with anger as he recalled what Fresia had said.\u201cI heard that Lady Floyen really liked Sir Mikhail. People say that she chased him around without caring about her reputation\u2026 In some ways, it\u2019s fortunate that they separated.\u201dMax started pacing back and forth in the room as he was filled with a sudden surge of irritation and restlessness. At that moment, a window came into his line of sight. It looked large enough for a person to use to enter and exit the room.\u201cDon\u2019t cause any trouble and wait there quietly, okay?\u201d\u00a0Max remembered what Jubelian had whispered to him, but ignored her words and opened the window.\u2018I can\u2019t just sit here and do nothing.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - Hostility And Conflict\u201cLady Veronica, would you like to go out with me sometime?\u201d\u201cOh my, yes! I would love to! When should we?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s decide after seeing when we both have time to meet.\u201d Mikhail, who was conversing with Veronica, glanced over towards Jubelian.\u2018Now then, it\u2019s about time for her to react\u2026\u2019\u00a0Strangely enough, Jubelian was no longer sneaking any glances at him and was just quietly drinking her tea. \u201cVeronica, you have something here,\u201d he added on.\u201cAh yes. T-thank you,\u201d Veronica blushed while Mikhail smiled at her. Then he turned to Jubelian again and slightly squinted his eyes.\u2018That\u2019s strange.\u2019\u00a0Although he had done more than enough to make Jubelian cause a great fuss, she didn\u2019t show any reactions.\u00a0\u2018Why? Why isn\u2019t she looking at me?\u2019\u00a0Mikhail felt anger bubble violently inside of him at Jubelian\u2019s indifferent behavior.\u00a0\u2018She gives attention to mere commoners like that man, but isn\u2019t\u2026\u2019\u00a0Mikhail started feeling resentment towards her.\u201cAh, I would like to suggest one more thing,\u201d Rose spoke up, blushing from the attention as the members of the tea party turned towards her in unison. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, but I wanted to invite Lady Floyen to be a new member of our tea tasting parties. I\u2019d like to ask for your opinions about this. What does everyone think?\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, the other two ladies spoke up excitedly.\u201cOh my goodness, I would love to have her!\u201d one said.\u201cMe too!\u201d the other exclaimed. Since Jubelian had told them which dress shop she ordered her white dress from, they viewed her in a positive light. At their responses, there was a slight change in Jubelian\u2019s face, which had remained still until now.\u201cOh, I\u2026\u201d Mikhail, who had seen this expression several times, could tell what she was thinking. Although it was a face that showed embarrassment and shyness, it was filled with joy. It was the expression that Mikhail had so badly wanted to see again.\u2018How come she showed that face to women like them\u2026 but not to me?\u2019\u00a0Overwhelmed with devastation, Mikhail stared blankly at Jubelian.\u201cI disagree,\u201d a voice spoke at that moment causing the faint smile on Jubelian\u2019s face to disappear. Mikhail, who witnessed the change, felt his heart ache.\u2018She always did that when I was being cold to her as well.\u2019\u00a0Upon realizing this, Mikhail felt angry at Veronica for voting against her.\u00a0\u2018This good-for-nothing woman.\u2019\u00a0However, Veronica continued talking, as if she didn\u2019t notice his ferocious gaze.\u201cI\u2019m not against it for no reason\u2026 We have requirements that must be met for someone to join!\u201dSeeming convinced, the members nodded their heads.\u201cWell, that\u2019s an undeniable fact.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. We decided on that when we first formed the group.\u201dRose let out a sigh. \u201cLady Floyen, there are some conditions you must meet before you can join.\u201dAt those words, Jubelian replied as if nothing was wrong. \u201cOh, yes. It can\u2019t be helped if I don\u2019t qualify. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dMikhail felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at her calm words.\u201cOh, if you have training, then I guess it can\u2019t be helped. You don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d\u00a0she had said.Recalling this memory, Mikhail opened his mouth without thinking. \u201cI think it\u2019s better if you hear the requirements first before making a decision.\u201dJubelian\u2019s eyes shook faintly when she heard his words. Seeing her expression, Mikhail smiled with satisfaction.* * *Feeling extremely flustered, I glared at Mikhail.\u00a0\u2018Wait, why is that guy interfering in other people\u2019s business?\u2019\u00a0Of course, I was excited when I was invited to join the group. It was my first time as Jubelian where noblewomen my age showed goodwill towards me. However, due to my situation, I couldn\u2019t fully enjoy their kindness.\u2018Right now, I\u2019m in a situation where it wouldn\u2019t be weird if I were thrown out of the group at any moment.\u2019\u00a0Having decided to reject the offer, I waited for Rose to speak up when something caught my eye.\u2018When did he get out?\u2019\u00a0I inhaled sharply. I had asked Max to quietly wait for me, but he was now staring at me from the top of a tree. I felt suffocated by such a sight.\u00a0\u2018If the people here notice him as well\u2026 that will be the end of my life.\u2019\u00a0Max was currently posing as my lover. If others discovered that he was climbing trees to peek at the banquet, my father would surely say, \u201cAre you going to continue dating that ill-mannered guy? It would be better for you to marry the crown prince.\u201dThinking about how my life might end, I took a deep breath.\u201cLady Floyen, did you hear what I said just now?\u201d Rose asked.I nodded at Rose\u2019s question. \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cOh, so you\u2019re alright with the requirements?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Rose and the other noblewomen smiled brightly at my answer.\u201cWow, I\u2019ll be looking forward to it.\u201d\u201cLikewise.

I could see Lady Terence standing up to follow him.\u201cOh, me too\u2026\u201d she started, but Rose called out to her.\u201cVeronica, shouldn\u2019t you set the date for our next tea party?\u201dFrowning, Lady Terence sat back down. \u201cDarn it!

My safety came first, and it was my principle that everyone should take care of themselves. But seeing how her expression was similar to the faces I\u2019ve made in the past; I couldn\u2019t leave her be. \u201cI\u2019m angry,\u201d I admitted.\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked as if I said something ridiculous. There was no backing down now.\u201cI was often ignored as well,\u201d I said.\u201cWho are you saying was ignored?\u201d She stood up from her seat, trembling.It was understandable for her to not want to admit it. I acknowledged her feelings because I was once like her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel bad.\u201d She continued to glare at me as I apologized and stood up from my seat. If I stayed here any longer, I was only going to hurt her more. \u201cAs promised, I\u2019ll host the next tea party. However, if it will distress you to take part, you don\u2019t have to come. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d With these words, I left the room.* * *Meanwhile, Mikhail was wearing a dark expression as he stomped out of the drawing room.\u00a0\u2018How dare that shallow man\u2026!\u2019\u00a0It was irritating that the man next to Jubelian was scowling at him, but he chose to ignore it because it was ridiculous. He would only end up looking foolish if he let out his anger at a petty commoner. But just now, when he found out that Jubelian\u2019s attention was on that man and that she showed all kinds of expressions while looking at him, it felt like his heart was being burned black.\u2018That can\u2019t be true!\u2019\u00a0Mikhail didn\u2019t want to admit the fact that such a lowlife was able to stir up such emotions in Jubelian. It was because of this reason that Mikhail would glare at Max with bloodthirsty eyes whenever Jubelian looked away. However, the arrogant commoner only smiled back at him while motioning to cut his neck as if threatening to kill him.\u2018I\u2019ll kill you, you conceited rascal!\u2019\u00a0Mikhail left the mansion in search of Max. As he passed by a deserted area, he heard a low voice speaking vulgar words.\u201cCrawling out of there pretty late, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Max, who had just insulted a nobleman, was staring at Mikhail with his red eyes. He was standing in a slightly dim area.\u2018You\u2019ve lost your sense of fear, you egoistic man.\u2019\u00a0One of the virtues of the Imperial Knights was for them to not easily boast their strength. However, Mikhail had no intention of showing generosity to the commoner who had just committed mutiny against him.\u00a0\u2018It should be fine if I just break his arm, right?\u2019\u00a0Mikhail, who was about to make his move after finding the right excuse to punish this man, was swept by a powerful blow and grabbed by the collar in an instant. It had happened before anyone could notice.\u2018W-what did he just do?\u2019\u00a0his face scrunched slightly as he was trying to understand what was happening. \u201cUgh!\u201d He cried out as his body was slammed against the ground. Mikhail tried his best to lift himself from the sudden shock when a long shadow cast over him.\u201cJust as I thought, crawling suits petty people,\u201d the man said bleakly. There was something close to madness looming inside his slightly curved red eyes. Mikhail stared at Max in shock. He had thought that Max was just a good-looking playboy because of the disinterested expression he wore. But the quick movements he had just shown and the overwhelming pressure from his red eyes felt completely different from the same man he saw a while ago.\u2018This man. What on earth is he?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - I Don\u2019t Love You AnymoreMikhail\u2019s stinging flesh was a constant reminder that the man in front of him was dangerous. Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t want to back down. Jubelian was a woman who had blindly followed him without being aware of the dangers surrounding her. He couldn\u2019t tell if she was slow-witted or stupid, but the way she would smile at him, even when he made it obvious he didn\u2019t like her, made his stomach turn.\u2018I can\u2019t let such a dangerous man like him stay by that dense woman,\u2019\u00a0he decided. Although she may have lacked in many aspects, Jubelian still belonged to him. Mikhail couldn\u2019t help but be bothered by the fact that a parasitic man like Max had attached himself to her. With this reasoning in mind, Mikhail hurriedly stood up and glared at him.\u201cYou. Who are you and what makes you think you can stay by Jubelian?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Max replied while slightly furrowing his eyebrows.At Max\u2019s perverse tone, Mikhail drew his sword without hesitation and pointed the tip towards Max\u2019s neck. \u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded, the silver blade in his hand not wavering. Mikhail was determined to mercilessly cut down his opponent if Max spoke anymore nonsense.Even though his life was being threatened, Max remained calm. \u201cDidn\u2019t Jubelian already tell you? We\u2019re lovers.\u201dThe moment he heard those words, Mikhail felt anger surge up inside him. He wanted to cut through the arrogant man\u2019s neck right away but refrained from doing so because he was unsure of Jubelian\u2019s reaction. Mikhail held onto the little patience he had left and raised his voice.\u201cNonsense! There\u2019s no way she\u2019d love something like you! Who are you? What purpose\u2014\u201d\u201cMikhail Albert Hessen, put that sword down.\u201d A cold, ruthless voice interrupted him.Mikhail flinched. He never thought he would hear her call his name in such a voice.\u201cPut that sword down right now,\u201d she repeated.At her sharp, commanding tone, Mikhail\u2019s hand that was holding the sword fell helplessly to his side. \u201cJubelian,\u201d he called her name with regret. However, all he received was a frigid stare.\u201cIt\u2019s not Jubelian. It\u2019s Lady Floyen. Please refrain from being disrespectful, Lord Hessen,\u201d she said.Even though the difference between the status of a duke\u2019s and a marquis\u2019 family may have only been one rank, the gap could never be considered negligible. Even while he dated Jubelian, who was of a higher social ranking, Mikhail had never felt this difference.\u201cCall me Jubelian, Mikhail,\u201d\u00a0she had said. The woman Mikhail knew had always treated him kindly without holding back. But now, he could clearly see the distinction between their statuses after she drew a strict line between them.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lady Floyen,\u201d Mikhail said. Deep down, he wanted her to say that she made a mistake just now and to correct her actions, but he received a cold-hearted interrogation instead.\u201cWhy were you pointing your sword at my boyfriend?\u201d she asked while looking at him calmly with her sky-blue lake-like eyes. Even though he had found her bothersome, Mikhail had always thought her eyes were pleasant.\u201cAnswer me,\u201d she ordered.But now, he couldn\u2019t help but be taken aback by the hostility and lack of sympathy in her eyes.\u201cMy lady, I\u2014\u201d Mikhail opened his mouth to make an excuse, but Jubelian cut him off with a sharp voice.\u201cAn Imperial Knight drawing his sword so easily? If my father found out about this, he would be disappointed,\u201d she said and walked past him towards Max.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked Max in a warm tone. Mikhail couldn\u2019t believe that she was the same person who had just spoken so harshly to him. Looking at her, he could see that Jubelian\u2019s eyes were now filled with warmth. \u201cMax, I told you to wait for me quietly,\u201d she continued.\u201cI felt cramped in there because the room was so small,\u201d the man complained. Jubelian sighed and refrained from making any comments about Max\u2019s informal speaking.\u201cI guess you must have felt confined. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she apologized.Mikhail frowned when he heard Jubelian apologize instead of Max.\u00a0\u2018Why is she apologizing when she did nothing wrong\u2026\u2019\u00a0Then he recalled a moment from his past that was similar to the event playing out before him. It was the day he got irritated at her because she visited after his training finished.\u00a0\u201cOh, you must be tired. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d\u00a0she had said. He actually wasn\u2019t irritated because he was tired. He reacted that way because he knew she would accept him no matter what. For Mikhail, Jubelian was the most comfortable person for him to be around and someone he could always let out his anger on. It was only now that he realized how terrible he had treated her.\u2018Why did I do that?\u2019\u00a0he thought, staring at Jubelian with sorrow. He could see her holding out her small, thin hand to Max.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said.Mikhail clenched his fists at the sight. Her warm eyes, her calm and pleasant voice, and even her small and thin hands were all originally his. He couldn\u2019t lose her to this dangerous man with an unknown identity. Before he could think about his actions, Mikhail angrily stomped towards Jubelian and snatched her wrist.\u201cJubelian, we need to talk.\u201d He held onto her slender wrist and tried to drag her away when his wrist was grabbed roughly.\u201cLet go,\u201d the man said, his eyes filled with bloodlust. Mikhail felt suffocated under the force of his gaze. The strength of his grip, which seemed as if it could break his forearm, was like that of an angry animal rather than a human.\u2018How dare a mere commoner\u2026!\u2019\u00a0Mikhail tried to shake off Max\u2019s hand, but strangely, it didn\u2019t move an inch. He was about to lash out in anger when Jubelian spoke.\u201cStop it, Max.\u201dAt her discouraging words, Max almost immediately released his grip.\u00a0\u2018Why?\u2019\u00a0he asked himself. He was doubting his behavior when he recalled the words he once spit out to his master in defiance.\u201cI think I\u2019ve found it. My weakness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - I Don\u2019t Love You AnymoreA sense of rejection washed over him.\u00a0\u2018Me? Having a weakness? There\u2019s no way.\u2019\u00a0Max had never been defeated in war and thus considered himself perfect and flawless. It was natural for him to feel repulsed by the word \u2018weakness.\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said.\u201cPlease, Max. If you keep acting like this\u2026\u201d Jubelian sighed.As Max looked into her calm, but warm eyes, he felt strangely relaxed. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, finally loosening his grip that was almost crushing Mikhail\u2019s arm.\u201cThank you.\u201d Jubelian smiled at him.Mistaking the smile for himself, the corners of Mikhail\u2019s mouth lifted.\u00a0\u2018Yeah, this is how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u2019\u00a0No matter what he did, Jubelian was always on his side. Mikhail\u2019s smile widened as he regained his confidence for his faltering faith. Jubelian, who had been looking at Max the whole time, turned toward him.\u00a0\u2018Is she finally going to look at me?\u2019\u00a0he awaited in joy. However, his happiness was soon crushed when he heard what she said next.\u201cGet your hand off of me, Mikhail Albert Hessen.\u201dMikhail felt as if his heart was being cut into a thousand pieces by her ruthless words.* * *I could see the look of shock on Mikhail\u2019s face as soon as I finished speaking. It was natural for him to react that way since I had always respected him in the past. This was the first time I\u2019ve ever shown him the power of my authority. Even so, he should have had this attitude towards me from the beginning. After all, I had personally lowered my standards for a man of an inferior status. Now, there was no longer any reason for me to continue showing him generosity as I had a higher social status as the duke\u2019s daughter.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to let go? Can you not hear me?\u201d I questioned Mikhail. He eventually let go of my hand without any objections. I scowled at him as I touched my tender wrist. It looked like I was going to end up with a bruise, seeing how he left a red mark.\u2018He\u2019s really annoying me,\u2019\u00a0I spitefully thought. Since I felt guilty for what I did to him in my past life, I was being considerate towards him as much as I could. But there was no reason for me to continue if he was just going to be inconsiderate to me.\u201cForcefully touching others without their consent is an act of violence. I hope you haven\u2019t done this to anyone other than me,\u201d I spit out courageously. I then remembered that Max had grabbed Mikhail\u2019s wrist as if to damage it a few moments ago.\u2018Since Max did something to him, I\u2019ll just call it even.\u2019\u201cHowever, because of what my boyfriend has done to you, I will forgive your rudeness,\u201d I continued with a sigh. At the word \u2018forgiveness,\u2019 he raised his head.\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of ignoring me now after telling me that you loved me so much?\u201d he uttered in a somber tone.I became somewhat puzzled and frowned at his words.\u00a0\u2018Wait, isn\u2019t it better if I pretend to not know him?\u2019\u00a0At this point, I didn\u2019t know if it was worth it to reply to his illogical words.Mikhail smirked at my dumbfounded expression. \u201cBy any chance, are you trying to get my attention?\u201dWhat kind of change in attitude was this? He wasn\u2019t even acting ridiculous anymore; in fact, I thought he had gone crazy.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s doing this to me again.\u2019\u00a0His sudden strange behavior was starting to give me a headache, but I soon regained my reason when I figured out the cause behind his actions.\u00a0\u2018Ah, I see. He\u2019s probably paranoid\u2026 because I stalked him for the past two years.\u2019\u00a0It was a bit unfortunate, but if I left things as they were, then he might continue coming up with bizarre meanings behind my behavior in the future.\u201cI\u2019ll make this clear for you. I\u2019m no longer interested in you,\u201d I explained. I spoke politely to him out of pity, but I clearly stated my disinterest.\u00a0\u2018This should be good enough, right?\u2019I thought I had resolved the misunderstanding, but contrary to my beliefs, he shouted while his face contorted in pain. \u201cYou said you loved me!\u201dWhat he said was an undeniable fact, so I nodded at his words. \u201cYes, I did.\u201dHe looked at me with a peculiar expression, as if wondering if I was going to change my mind. I could see his slightly flushed cheeks and his wavering purple eyes. If I thought about it, I might have been able to figure out what he was thinking. If I were my past self, I probably would have gotten my hopes up. But none of that mattered now. I had already ended my relationship with him.\u201cBut not anymore,\u201d I finished.I approached Max, who was watching us with a scowl. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said, but he didn\u2019t budge an inch.\u2018He\u2019s probably sulking because I told him to let go of Mikhail\u2019s wrist.\u2019\u00a0I locked my arm with his and spoke gently as if soothing a little kid. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you cake, so please stop being mad at me, okay?\u201d At that moment, he flinched and moved his arm so that it would be easier for us to link arms.\u00a0\u2018Did he want to eat cake that much? What a simple guy.\u2019\u00a0I smiled at him then glanced back at Mikhail and opened my mouth.\u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t try to talk to me anymore. I don\u2019t want to get involved with you ever again,\u201d I said sincerely then started walking to the carriage.\u2018What kind of cake should we eat today?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Please Listen to MeLong after the two had disappeared from his sight, Mikhail continued to stand there absent-mindedly.\u2018She doesn\u2019t love me anymore?\u2019\u00a0His body shook with anger and betrayal when he recalled her shocking remark.\u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t try to talk to me anymore. I don\u2019t want to get involved with you ever again.\u201dIt was hard to believe that the mouth that once whispered words of love in his ears had spouted such nonsense. Mikhail\u2019s eyes gleamed as he clenched his fists.\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous. I never agreed to your request.\u2019\u00a0Suddenly, a set of slender fingers wrapped around his wrist. Thinking it was Jubelian, Mikhail turned his head but hardened his expression when he saw who it was.\u201cAre you okay, Sir Mikhail?\u201d Veronica asked.Mikhail felt irritation surge inside him at Veronica\u2019s appearance. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. You\u2019re a nuisance,\u201d he spat out and roughly pushed her away.Veronica stared at Mikhail\u2019s back in disbelief.\u00a0\u2018How could he do this to me?\u2019\u00a0She was on the verge of tears when a dreadfully bleak voice came to mind.\u201cI was often ignored as well,\u201d\u00a0Jubelian had said.Veronica had misunderstood her words because she thought Jubelian was laughing at her. But now she knew what the lady had meant when she saw her pity-filled eyes.\u2018Oh, you\u2019ve been through the same thing as well\u2026\u2019\u00a0Veronica laughed dejectedly as tears rolled down her cheeks.* * *\u201cDo you like it?\u201dMax nodded at my question. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. He was attractive and pleasant to look at even while eating, which I had expected from a handsome man like him. The expression of one being \u201cstunning,\u201d which people used to describe celebrities they saw in person, was the perfect description for him.\u2018If the Internet existed in this world, then he could have made a lot of money doing a cake eating show or something similar.\u2019\u00a0I was deep in my ridiculous thoughts when I noticed he was glaring at me.\u201cWhy do you keep staring at me?\u201d he questioned.\u201cOh, I just have something to say.\u201dWith some cream from the cake on his lips, he turned his attention to me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dI sighed at his question.\u00a0\u2018Will this headstrong guy listen to me?\u2019\u00a0Just a while ago, he had climbed onto a tree and confronted Mikhail at the tea party. I had considered ending the contract because of this reckless and impulsive behavior. But since he viewed me in a positive light and was helping me, I decided to persuade him instead.\u201cI want you to be careful in front of others in the future,\u201d I started.\u201cThat\u2019s why I spoke formally to you when we were with other people,\u201d he responded calmly.\u201cNo, not that\u2026 I\u2019m talking about things like what happened with Mikhail.\u201dHe squinted his eyes as if he couldn\u2019t understand what I was saying. \u201cWhat about that?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, you can get in big trouble,\u201d I expressed my concern.However, he only continued to stare at me with skepticism. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to lose against someone as weak as him?\u201d His triumphant expression was full of groundless confidence.I let out another sigh. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\u201dRather than a democratic society, this novel\u2019s setting was based on a strict, absolute monarchy. Since it was a place where people were divided into classes, the reality was that commoners couldn\u2019t protest even if they were subjected to horribly unfair things.\u201cIf you get into a conflict with a noble\u2014\u201d I tried to explain to him that it would be legally disadvantageous for a commoner to clash against a noble, but he cut me off and dismissed me as if he didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201cI can take on ten of those weaklings with no problem.\u201dWinning and losing wasn\u2019t the important thing here, but I gave up on trying to explain when I realized he couldn\u2019t understand the essence of this issue.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter how skilled you are if your opponent is a nobleman,\u2019\u00a0I sighed. Although I had saved Max from Baron Gordon and angrily shut down Mikhail, the only reason they couldn\u2019t talk back was because of my status. Usually, conflicts about inequality were only resolved between nobles. If a commoner confronted a nobleman, and they were unlucky, he or she could be beaten or even killed. This was why most commoners chose to live with the injustice. I don\u2019t know if it was because I\u2019ve grown attached to my father\u2019s disciple in the short amount of time we spent together, but I wished for this na\u00efve man to live a life with no trouble.\u201cStill, you never know when you might get hurt,\u201d I said.\u201cBut I won\u2019t,\u201d he replied.My voice rose from frustration. \u201cI\u2019m only saying this because I\u2019ve been worried! So\u2026\u201d I was about to tell him to stay quiet and avoid causing conflict when I noticed the strange expression on his face.\u201cYou were worried that I\u2019d get hurt?\u201d he asked.\u201cOh, um\u2026 well\u2026 yes.\u201d It was true that I was worried about him getting hurt, but I was more worried that he might cause a big problem and be sentenced to death. However, I decided against telling him that.An awkward silence followed, and he furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked in confusion.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want anyone around me, including myself, to get hurt,\u201d I said.\u201cI already told you that I won\u2019t get hurt.\u201dHe seemed to be pretty confident in his combat skills since he was my father\u2019s disciple. I locked eyes with the man who had repeated himself and opened my mouth.\u201cNo matter how strong you are and how high of a position you\u2019re in, you can still be defeated.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My father was a hero, and I had a grand status as the daughter of a duke, but during a crucial moment, everyone had turned their backs on me. In the end, the only option left for me in my crisis was death.\u201cNo matter how strong and remarkable you are, you shouldn\u2019t be overconfident about your situation or abilities. The moment the majority becomes your enemy, they will wait for the day you become weak.\u201d I smiled bitterly.When I thought about my future, I became overwhelmed with hopelessness.\u00a0\u2018I guess it\u2019s easier said than done.\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Max said, looking at me with a serious expression.I was dumbfounded by his ignorant response to my earnest words.\u00a0\u2018I knew it. It\u2019s too much for a person who talks down towards me to understand power differentials in the first place.\u2019\u00a0I gave up on trying to explain it to him and decided to get straight to the point.\u201cThat\u2019s not what matters now.

I didn\u2019t think he would blurt out the answer just like that after saying random things this whole time. I froze in astonishment but then frowned.\u00a0\u2018I thought he couldn\u2019t understand, but he knew what I was talking about all along?\u2019\u00a0Even though he understood, I looked at him with questioning eyes because there was a chance he would disagree with me.\u201cSo, are you willing to accept my request?\u201d I asked carefully.\u201cOkay, while I\u2019m with you, I won\u2019t fight with others,\u201d he answered immediately. It wasn\u2019t a very reliable statement, but the problem was resolved for now.\u2018Alright, now I have to\u2026\u2019\u00a0I took out a handkerchief and handed it to him.\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d he asked and took it from my hand.\u201cWipe the cream off your lips.\u201d I finally told him about the thing that had been bothering me throughout our conversation.He scrunched up his face and cleaned up the cream.* * *When he got back to his residence, Max scowled.\u00a0\u2018Did she think I\u2019d lose to someone like him?\u2019\u00a0Max hated it when someone looked down on him. He normally wouldn\u2019t have allowed for an assumption like that to be made. He then recalled what Jubelian had said to him in the past.\u201cYou told me you owe someone, right? Take this and help that person out.\u201dIt was arrogant of his master\u2019s daughter to look down on him and try to take care of him.\u00a0\u2018Except for my master, I\u2019ve never lost a fight against anyone. I don\u2019t need her charity,\u2019\u00a0Max thought in anger, then remembered Jubelian\u2019s words from earlier.\u201cI\u2019m only saying this because I\u2019m worried! So\u2026\u201dMax loosened his clenched fists.\u00a0\u2018I really don\u2019t understand.\u2019\u00a0Despite his determination to resolve Jubelian\u2019s misconceptions, Max was strangely not upset anymore. What he wanted instead was to not miss a single word sounding from her red lips.\u2018Just why?\u2019\u00a0He had thought hard about this problem before, but no matter how much he pondered over it, he couldn\u2019t come up with an answer. Max looked at the cake box he received from Jubelian and glowered.\u201cEven though I hate sweets, she still gave me this useless thing as a gift.\u201d Unlike his displeased murmur, his eyes were slightly soft. At that moment, the door opened and Fresia came in.\u201cLord Maximillian, I have a report on something you asked me to investigate\u2026 Oh my! What\u2019s with the cake?\u201dAt Fresia\u2019s question, Max straightened his expression and tried to switch the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said, but his eyes were still fixed on the cake box.As if her instincts were warning her, Fresia thought,\u00a0\u2018If I touch that cake, I\u2019ll be in big trouble.\u2019\u00a0\u201cOh, alright. Then I\u2019ll give you the report first\u2014\u201d she continued awkwardly but was cut off.\u201cThis cake is expensive.\u201dFresia flinched at Max\u2019s sudden remark.\u00a0\u2018What does he want me to say to that?\u2019\u00a0She was flustered but managed to answer with a smile. \u201cAh, I see.\u201dMax\u2019s eyes became sharp at her response as if he weren\u2019t satisfied. \u201cApparently, it\u2019s from the best tearoom in the capital,\u201d he said.Although it was a fake identity, Fresia was the owner of the largest salon in the capital. At his words, she could instantly guess what Max\u2019s intentions were.\u00a0\u2018Is he telling me to praise the cake?\u2019\u00a0It was unusual behavior from her lord as he hated sweets, but, just in case, Fresia opened her mouth to compliment the cake.\u201cThe decorations certainly look great. The strawberries look fresh as well.\u201d\u201cYes, because it\u2019s a cake boasted by the best tearoom in the capital.\u201dAlthough they were just flattering remarks to please him, Fresia could see Max smiling.\u00a0\u2018As I thought, it\u2019s a gift from Lady Floyen,\u2019\u00a0she assumed, narrowing her eyes slightly.\u201cFresia,\u201d Max called her.\u201cAh, yes, my lord.\u201d She wore a serious expression as she waited for Max to continue in case he was about to give an order.Max opened his mouth after a short moment. \u201cSince you\u2019ve worked so hard all this time\u2026 I\u2019ll give you this cake as a special gift.\u201dFresia couldn\u2019t believe her ears.\u00a0\u2018Did the lord just offer to share his precious cake with me?\u2019\u00a0With her wealth, she could buy as many cakes as she wanted. But this was the first time Maximillian was giving her a personal gift, so she knew that this cake was very special. \u201cThank you, my lord. I\u2019ll make sure to savor every bite.\u201dMax nodded at her emotional response. \u201cDon\u2019t eat it all. Half of it is mine.\u201dFresia knitted her eyebrows.\u00a0\u2018If he\u2019s going to give it to me, wouldn\u2019t it be better to give me all of it? He doesn\u2019t even like sweets.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
