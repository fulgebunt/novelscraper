I am\u2026 Long Chen!\u201d\u201cI look down on the very heavens, the arrogant nine heavens\u2019 peerless Pill God - Long Chen? \u2026 I am someone who is cheated and bullied by everyone, a spineless, good-for-nothing cripple incapable of cultivating - Long Chen?\u201dHis mind was a whirl of confusion, and at the same time, severe pain came from all over his body. Long Chen was unable to stop his mind\u2019s chaotic thoughts and emitted a pained groan.\u201cChen-er, you\u2019ve finally awakened? Thank god, your mom was worried sick for you! If you want to brag about how strong you are, then fine, but why did you have to go duel with those people!?\u201dA kind and gentle voice sounded beside Long Chen\u2019s ear. That voice was full of happiness and comfort, but towards the end, it also became choked with emotion.Long Chen slowly opened his eyes. His blurry vision gradually became clearer, and a woman\u2019s face appeared before him.The woman appeared to be in her thirties and she was extremely beautiful. However, in the corner of her eyes were some deep wrinkles that did not match up with her young age.Currently, this woman was tearfully looking at Long Chen with eyes that were full of love, making Long Chen\u2019s heart feel a burst of warmth.\u201cChild, you scared your mom to death.\u201d As the woman spoke, her eyes became even redder and her tears streamed down.\u201cMom???\u201dLong Chen looked at this familiar yet strange face. He doubtingly said this one word, his face filled with confusion.\u201cChild, don\u2019t scare your mom! Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d The woman\u2019s face immediately became panicked.At this moment, an elderly man appeared beside the woman. He examined Long Chen and he said, \u201cMrs. Long, Long Chen suffered a blow to the back of his head so it\u2019s possible he will need to rest a bit to recover his memories. Don\u2019t be too worried; just now I gave the young master some medicine. The medicinal energy still hasn\u2019t completely dissolved, so just let the young master rest for a bit longer.\u201dMrs. Long worriedly looked at Long Chen. Reluctantly, she nodded her head and followed the elderly man out of the room.Long Chen heard the elderly man advising the woman softly in the distance, \u201cMrs. Long, the fact that young master Long managed to return with his life is already infinitely lucky. Don\u2019t force it too much.\u201dMrs. Long tremblingly replied, \u201cMaster alchemist\u2019s meaning is that my son will\u2026\u201dThe elderly man, who had been called an alchemist, sighed, \u201cThe young master\u2019s hindbrain received an acute shock. To tell the truth, being able to wake up is already extremely lucky; however, the repercussions will definitely still be very severe. Losing his memory is quite possible in this situation\u2026\u201dThe two people gradually walked further and further away so Long Chen could no longer hear them clearly\u2026 But what was barely audible to him was the sound of Mrs. Long\u2019s sobbing.Long Chen gazed blankly at the ceiling above as he felt the severe pains throughout his body, especially at the back of his head which was bursting with swollen, aching pain.Just what happened? I\u2019m Long Chen, and so Mrs. Long is my flesh and blood mother. How could I have such an unfamiliar feeling?And all these confusing memories, where did they come from? I have memories that I\u2019m an arrogant, exceedingly powerful person\u2026 but at the same time, I remember that I\u2019m an often bullied and extorted bitter trash?Pill God Long Chen? Trash Long Chen? Which is the real me? Am I the Pill God\u2019s reincarnation? Or am I a fusion of the Pill God\u2019s soul with a trash weakling?Long Chen\u2019s mind was full of endless questions. \u201cWhatever, it doesn\u2019t matter. I am Long Chen. Whether I\u2019m Pill God Long Chen or the old, crippled Long Chen doesn\u2019t mean anything right now. The most important thing is that I\u2019m still alive.\u201cI have two sets of memories that have mixed together; how would I even try to fix this kind of insane problem? Instead, what I need to do now is to let myself recover as quickly as possible.\u201dSensing his body\u2019s current condition, he quickly located many fractures. He had three broken ribs, one arm broken in two places, and most severe of all, his hindbrain was injured to the point where a large portion of his scalp had caved in. He had definitely been victim to an extremely vicious assault.\u201cHuh, although I have no way to condense energy, my Spiritual Strength appears to be extremely powerful. I can actually sense everything within thirty meters of my body.\u201dLong Chen was pleasantly surprised. According to his garbled memories, Spiritual Strength was invaluable, especially to pill cultivators!Profit, profit! Whether he was the reincarnation of the Pill God or his soul just contained a mix containing the Pill God\u2019s memories, the present him had definitely greatly profited.The Pill God had lived an entire lifetime already, and now that allowed him to possess an exceptionally strong soul; just what kind of awesomeness was this?However, when he carefully examined his body, his expression changed. \u201cMy Spiritual Root has been taken away. My abdomen\u2019s Spirit Bone is also missing a piece that appears to have been dug out. And my heart has a hole? Just who would be this ruthless and take my Spirit Root, Spirit Bone and Spirit Blood? No wonder I can\u2019t cultivate!\u201d Long Chen was completely infuriated.His current Spiritual Strength was much, much stronger than his old self. It was now strong enough for him to immediately figure out the mystery of why he was a cripple who couldn\u2019t cultivate.The Spirit Root was located in the Dantian; it was the foundation for all cultivators. Without the Spirit Root, there was no way to sense heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual energy, let alone absorb it for cultivating.Spirit Blood was something that people were born with; it was a trace of blood that gave you innate talent. While basically all people were born with it, the majority of cultivators didn\u2019t know anything about it.The Spirit Bone was found in the pit of a person\u2019s abdomen and slightly bulged out. Ordinary people wouldn\u2019t have a Spirit Bone. Even amongst cultivators, maybe only one in ten thousand would have one, which marked them as a genius.However, Long Chen's Spirit Bone was obviously missing a piece and had clear marks of being dug out by someone.His face became exceedingly unsightly. If his memories were not all mixed up, then how could he not remember who had done this to his body?Although these three things were precious to him, they wouldn\u2019t have any use once they left his body. If they wanted to harm him, why did they have to use such a harsh method? Using this kind of method was practically causing him to live a life worse than death!However, anger only brought on more anger, and since he was already missing them, being angry did not have any use.You better not let me find out who did this.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but gnash his teeth in anger. This was an extremely great blow to him. With him possessing a Spirit Bone, even if he had been an idiot, he would still have been an absolute genius.But now some despicable bastard had caused him to become a useless person who was incapable of cultivating, causing him to be humiliated and receive condescending looks from practically everyone.Just when Long Chen was about to furiously erupt, the door of the room was gently pushed open, and a pretty thirteen-year-old maiden walked in. This was Long Chen\u2019s maid who was called Bao-er.\u201cYoung master, it\u2019s time to take some medicine.\u201d\u201cMedicine? What medicine is it?\u201d Long Chen nose sniffed slightly as he asked.\u201cThis is something Mrs. Long paid an enormous price for. It\u2019s a Tiger Bone Pill that can quickly heal young master\u2019s injuries.\u201d Bao-er replied.She opened the small, elaborate case in her hand, revealing the medicinal pill inside. \u201cIt is said that this medicinal pill came from grandmaster Yun Qi. The medicinal strength is very strong.\u201dLooking at the thing, Long Chen\u2019s face became a bit strange. Even this kind of plaything could be called a pill? Its shape was extremely uneven and seemed more like a meatball.Even not talking about the shape, its color was completely black and there wasn\u2019t even a trace of luster. If it wasn\u2019t emitting a very faint medicinal aroma, then Long Chen might even suspect that it was a ball of sheep dung.After staring at the thing in his hand for a long time, Long Chen finally sighed. Someone who had ending up losing over eighty percent of the medicinal pill\u2019s essence could still be called a grandmaster? Long Chen bewilderedly wondered how someone could have created something so soft and mushy.Pills could be divided into five grades: low grade, middle grade, high grade, top grade, and peerless grade. As for the pill in his hand, it couldn\u2019t even count as one of the five grades. Long Chen suddenly realized that this was just a defective good. It was a trash pill. Normally, alchemists would definitely not sell these kinds of medicinal pills since they couldn\u2019t afford to lose their customers. Oftentimes, they would be turned into medicinal liquids or just directly thrown out.\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t daydream. In order to obtain this precious pill, Mrs. Long already sold off her own precious jewelry. You should hurry and take it,\u201d urged Bao-er.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel some pain in his heart. His impression of his mother was that she loved him very dearly to the point where it was like he were drowning in love. It had reached the point where his mother would basically never refuse any of his requests.His mother had done everything and anything for him. She had given birth to him while she was still young. She had been gifted with great beauty growing up, but now she was barely thirty-something years old and already had wrinkles in the corner of her eyes. Seeing those deep wrinkles, Long Chen knew that she had already sacrificed far too much for him.Looking at the medicinal pill in his hand, he observed that even though it was a defective good, at least the medicinal ingredients inside it were not bad. Impurities took up over eighty percent of it, but it wouldn\u2019t have any problems healing his injuries.Taking the medicinal pill, Long Chen ordered Bao-er to not leak any news of him out, excluding to his mother of course.Although Bao-er didn\u2019t really understand why, she still trusted Long Chen and obediently nodded.After taking the medicine, although Long Chen had no way to use cultivation to absorb the medicinal strength, he managed to guide the medicinal energy to his wounds by using his formidable Spiritual Strength, allowing him to recover extremely quickly.The second day, Long Chen slowly opened his eyes. He had a smile plastered on his mouth as he exercised his muscles.\u201cExcellent! Although that medicine was pretty bad, the medicinal ingredients themselves were of high quality. Other than my hindbrain, the majority of my injuries have already healed, and the amount of energy left is more than enough to heal me completely.\u201dHe slowly walked towards the mirror. Looking at his reflection, he saw a nothing-out-of-the-ordinary, handsome youngster with eyebrows like swords and bright eyes. Long Chen took a deep breath, \u201cFrom today onwards, I, Long Chen, will no longer be the previous Long Chen. I will rise above others.\u201dAlthough his body was still slightly weak, walking was no longer a problem. Long Chen left the room and saw that the sun had already risen from the east.After pondering deeply for an hour, he called over Bao-er and gave her a list of medicinal ingredients for her to find.However, Bao-er\u2019s expression became a bit embarrassed. Long Chen wondered what it was before quickly remembered that the current Long family was extremely hard-pressed for money, and Bao-er had no method to get a loan.Otherwise, his mother would not have had to sell off her own jewelry, a part of her exceptionally precious dowry. The present Long family had already fallen into extremely dire straits.Feeling around in his pocket, he found slightly over eighty silver coins. Although this wasn\u2019t a lot, it was enough to buy those medicinal ingredients on his list.Bao-er worked diligently, and not even two hours later, she had managed to buy the medicinal ingredients. Long Chen immediately set about to measuring and dividing them into different portions before boiling them in a large bowl.Six hours later, a very thick medicinal liquid was releasing a medicinal aroma. As Long Chen looked into the bowl with the cheap medicinal liquid, a smile appeared on his face.\u201cI, Long Chen, will rise above others, starting from this one bowl of medicinal liquid.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Long Chen didn\u2019t have a Spirit Root; thus, his Dantian was completely empty and had no way to store energy.The only thing he could do was to allow the medicinal energy to scatter into every cell. Although this medicinal liquid was formed only from ordinary medicinal herbs, it displayed a surprisingly remarkable medicinal effect after going through Long Chen\u2019s pairings and proportions.As the medicinal energy rushed throughout his body, countless pores opened up. It was as if every single cell had been in a state of starvation as they all began to crazily absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.BOOM!A muffled explosion came from within Long Chen\u2019s body. His originally sealed meridians were all forced open and Long Chen couldn\u2019t stop himself from letting out a muffled groan.When others cultivated, they would use the Dantian\u2019s qi in order to gradually open up their meridians in a step-by-step manner which would not cause any pain.However, Long Chen couldn\u2019t do so; he could only borrow an outer energy source. This energy was like the ocean\u2019s water flowing into a river field; its violent and ferocious nature wasn\u2019t something that just anybody could withstand.\u201cThis pain\u2026 I will definitely remember this pain.\u201d Long Chen gnashed his teeth. If it weren\u2019t for some vicious person stealing his Spirit Root, how could he have been forced to choose such a crazy method?BANG BANG BANG!Continuous explosions echoed out from his body as his meridians opened up one by one. Every time a meridian channel was opened, intense pain would wreck his body.When all his meridians were finally opened, Long Chen almost fell into a coma. He had to rest for two full hours before he slowly revitalized himself.With the pain now past him, Long Chen felt that the pores from his toes to his head were all open. With every single breath he took, he absorbed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.\u201cExcellent, I can finally practice cultivation now that my meridians have opened.\u201dLong Chen sensed his body\u2019s condition. With his meridians opened, he could finally absorb spiritual qi from the world through his pores in order to nourish his body to become stronger.In fact, although his meridians had only just been opened, that single change filled his body with strength.He punched out, and the whistling wind that came with it made Long Chen smile. He hadn\u2019t endured that pain for nothing.For ordinary cultivators, they first had to enter a so-called qi sensing realm. Only once they were able to sense qi were they able to enter the Qi Condensation realm.However, Long Chen had taken an alternative path. By using medicinal energy to forcibly link himself up to heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi, he had managed to completely open his meridians, which was equivalent to stepping into Qi Condensation with a single step.However, it couldn\u2019t be said that he had truly stepped into Qi Condensation. Although his body had been strengthened to the point that it was on that level, the Qi Condensation realm involved condensing cyclones of qi within the Dantian. Without a Dantian, he was not truly in Qi Condensation.\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve forcibly opened my meridians, my useless Dantian is still unable to hold the true qi. When I fight with others, there\u2019s no way I can keep it up for more than a few moments. This still isn\u2019t good enough.\u201dLong Chen went through his new memories. Almost all of his new memories were only about alchemy. But eventually, he found the only memory he had that pertained to martial arts: the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.What surprised Long Chen pleasantly was that the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was practically custom-made for him. It was a secret technique capable of excavating even more of a person\u2019s potential. It didn\u2019t cultivate the Dantian, but the nine stars.Those nine stars were contained within the body. Once they were all formed, they would be equivalent to nine Dantians. When he saw that in his memories, he almost jumped in joy.But then as he continued comprehending this technique, he immediately felt as if a bucket of ice water had been thrown over him. To cultivate the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art required countless medicinal pills.In order to condense the first star, the FengFu Star, he would practically need an endless amount of energy. If he wanted to rely on just absorbing the energy from the air, not even a hundred years would be enough to condense it.In order to condense the first star, he would need an enormous amount of medicinal pills. Without such a huge number of medicinal pills, he wouldn\u2019t be able to cultivate in it.His Long family was broke, and there was no way for them to purchase a huge number of medicinal pills.\u201cI should first think of a method to make some money,\u201d Long Chen muttered to himself. After switching his clothes, he left his room. At this time it was already past noon, but there were unexpectedly few people to be seen in his huge noble estate, making it seem like an extremely desolate place.Long Chen\u2019s father was the Border Suppression Marquis. He was currently gone to the barbarian border. Long Chen and his mother had had to suffer many condescending gazes from everyone in the imperial capital over the past few years. Although they had the position of a noble family, compared to before, they were completely destitute. In their entire estate, there were only ten or so maids who did some part-time work for them since they couldn\u2019t afford to employ more people.It could be said that in all the aristocracy, they were the family in the worst straits, and Long Chen himself was the most destitute of the poor.Phoenix Cry Empire was currently in a golden age of martial arts. Basically, everyone practiced martial arts. But as it had turned out, Long Chen\u2019s trash physique meant that he was incapable of practicing martial arts, making him someone that everybody would sneer at.Opposite to Long Chen was his father, Long Tianxiao. He was the strongest of his generation and with him guarding the barbarian border, even if the barbarian tribes were to savagely attack, they would not have the ability to step even half a foot within the Phoenix Cry Empire.Long Tianxiao was the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s military god of this generation, whereas Long Chen had been a trash who couldn\u2019t even sense qi. It was impossible to prevent people from feeling that this tiger father had had a dog of a son.Countless people would jeer at him, but Long Chen wouldn\u2019t care. However, that day, the Savage Marquis\u2019s son, Zhou Yaoyang, had ridiculed Long Chen by saying that he wasn\u2019t his father\u2019s son.Long Chen\u2019s anger had immediately soared to the heavens. Zhou Yaoyang had obviously been insulting his mother as unfaithful! Long Chen\u2019s anger had even caused him to become muddle-headed and he had recklessly challenged his opponent to a duel.However, his opponent was a strong person at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation while he was just an ordinary person incapable of even sensing qi. He had basically been asking to be disgraced.As a result, he later was beaten to the point of losing consciousness and almost dying. He was sent home and the news caused Long Chen to be an object of ridicule for quite some time in the imperial capital.Leaving his noble estate, Long Chen went directly to the imperial capital\u2019s Hundred Herb Market. That was the place where all kinds of precious medicinal ingredients were sold. Right now what he needed to do was to get an understanding of the medicinal herbs\u2019 market situation.Along the road, there were quite a few people and when they recognized Long Chen, they couldn\u2019t help but to point at him behind his back; however, Long Chen was already used to this.But at the same time, he smiled bitterly inside. His own father had suppressed the entire barbarian border, which was an amazing, meritorious deed that protected the entire empire.However, what had he obtained for that? This mother and son duo had been left to suffer from bullying and humiliating stares in the imperial capital, and Long Chen had almost been beaten to death. How could this be considered repayment? A group of people that were protected by his father had all gave his son condescending gazes. This was his repayment?Long Chen quickened his footsteps. Although he wasn\u2019t afraid of these kinds of stares, he would always end up a bit gloomy. But at this moment, his path was suddenly blocked by a group of people.\u201cAiya, are you actually Long Chen? I heard you were beaten to the point where you couldn\u2019t even recognize your own mom, so how are you so lively that you ran out today?\u201dIn front of Long Chen was a sixteen-year-old teen wearing gaudy clothes and sneering at him with two guards.This person was also born as a noble heir in an aristocrat family and was called Li Hao. However, his position within the aristocracy was not high and his status was incomparable to Long Chen\u2019s. After all, in the Phoenix Cry Empire, nobility and status were only secondary as strength was still the most important thing.Li Hao was standing right in the middle of the road and if Long Chen wanted to go through, he would need to pass through him.If it was the previous Long Chen, he would have turned around and walked back, but today\u2019s Long Chen looked at Li Hao, shook his head, and sighed, \u201cPeople say even well-trained dogs know not to obstruct the road. Looks like you\u2019re not even as good as a dog.\u201d\u201cLong Chen, it seems you didn\u2019t remember the lesson that I gave you last time! If you want to be beaten within an inch of your life again, then let\u2019s fight in the martial arena.\u201d Li Hao\u2019s expression changed before taunted him once again.\u201cThat\u2019s why I said you were a dog. Just go eat crap with Zhou Yaoyang.\u201d Long Chen shook his head. He didn\u2019t want to waste his time on this kind of person. He needed to handle his own affairs, so he started to walk around him.\u201cLong Chen, you are asking for it!\u201dLi Hao\u2019s couldn\u2019t help but become angry. He was not expecting that the always cowardly Long Chen would actually act in such an unyielding manner that basically didn\u2019t even pay attention to him. He stuck out his arms to bar Long Chen\u2019s path.Long Chen frowned slightly, but just as he was about to say more, a person walked over and cursed Li Hao, \u201cLi Hao, you\u2019re the one asking for it! Just who do you think you are to dare threaten my brother?\u201dThe person who had come was an extremely tall eighteen-year-old. His height was especially extraordinary at seven feet tall, which was taller than either of them by over a head and very intimidating.\u201cShi Feng, this isn\u2019t your business! It\u2019d be best if you didn\u2019t meddle around.\u201dWhen Li Hao saw Shi Feng, all he could do was to act tough even though he was weaker. Shi Feng was also a noble heir whose status was about the same as his, but Shi Feng was a strong person who had reached the eighth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation while he was only at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.In addition, Shi Feng had an innate strength, which meant that amongst people in the same rank as him, only a few were an equal match for him. Therefore, Li Hao didn\u2019t have the guts to challenge Shi Feng.\u201cBrother Long Chen, I heard that that bastard Zhou Yaoyang beat you up. How about I go help you vent your anger? \u201c Shi Feng looked at Long Chen and his expression became indignant.Long Chen looked at the huge person in front of him, and his heart felt a bit of warmth. Shi Feng was the only one in the imperial capital who would consider him as his brother.\u201cNo thanks, my enmities are something that I will pay back myself. Just don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Long Chen faintly laughed, patting Shi Feng\u2019s shoulder.When Shi Feng heard Long Chen say this, he thought that Long Chen might be worried about his image and so he didn\u2019t raise the issue again.\u201cLet\u2019s go, come with me for a stroll,\u201d said Long Chen with a smile, and he brought Shi Feng for a walk.When Li Hao saw that the two of them considered him as just thin air, he couldn\u2019t help but angrily cursing, \u201cLong Chen, you little bastard, if you have the guts then you\u2019ll fight me in a duel!\u201dThey had just walked a couple of steps when Li Hao said this and they paused. From deep within Long Chen\u2019s eyes, a strong murderous intent was radiated as he slowly turned his head.\u201cYou want to have a duel with me?\u201d Long Chen\u2019s voice was extremely cold. Each word he spoke was just like ice shards that caused people to tremble in their bones.Li Hao couldn\u2019t help but shiver. For some reason, he felt that today\u2019s Long Chen was a bit different, but his big words had already been spoken so if at this time he was to act like a coward, then he would become the entire imperial capital\u2019s laughingstock.Moreover, he was already used to bullying Long Chen over and over, so with those experiences, he ignored the trace of fear that arose in his heart.\u201cNot bad, you dare to accept the duel?\u201d Li Hao mocked in a loud voice.\u201cNot a problem, however, I want to add some stakes,\u201d said Long Chen after a moment\u2019s thought.\u201cAdding stakes? Haha, your Long family is almost unable to feed yourselves, what are you going to take out as stakes? You could use your family\u2019s estate, or how about you become my slave?\u201d mocked Li Hao coldly.However what he didn\u2019t notice was that in the corner of Long Chen\u2019s mouth was a callous smile that seemed to have some hidden intentions.\u201cBrother Shi, can you lend me your martial sword?\u201d Long Chen asked.\u201cTake it.\u201dShi Feng did somewhat hate to part with it, but he still handed his sword over.Long Chen nodded, and he quietly recorded this favor into his heart. Towards Li Hao, he said, \u201cThis martial sword isn\u2019t top quality, but it is still worth eight thousand gold coins. For today I\u2019ll just count it as five thousand gold coins. If you win you can take the martial sword, but if you lose, you have to give me five thousand gold coins. How\u2019s that sound?\u201dLi Hao\u2019s heart shook; Shi Feng\u2019s sword was made from top quality steel and was forged by a master. It was definitely worth at least eight thousand gold coins.Today, this idiot Long Chen actually decided to use such a thing as a bet; Li Hao had long since started laughing cheerfully inside.He once again sneered, \u201cI don\u2019t know. If someone were to lose, will he renege out of the bet?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I, Shi Feng, will guarantee it.\u201d Shi Feng coldly smiled.\u201cGood, then let\u2019s go to the martial arena to sign the contract. If today I don\u2019t beat the teeth out of you, then in the future I wouldn\u2019t be Li Hao.\u201d Li Hao couldn\u2019t help from being extremely exuberant as he high-spiritedly spoke.Long Chen\u2019s face was still calm; however, within his eyes appeared some darkness. Li Hao was just one of Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s dogs, so Long Chen never paid any attention to him. But nowadays, they were always plotting against him; just what kind of hidden conspiracy was there?However, no matter what kind of conspiracy it was, the truth would always come to light one day. Long Chen walked directly to the martial arena outside the imperial capital.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus, a life and death stage had been built outside the imperial capital where people could resolve their personal differences.As long as both parties agreed and signed the martial arena contract, then once they entered into the martial arena, even if they killed their opponent, they wouldn\u2019t receive any punishment from the imperial capital.During most days, this place was filled with bustling crowds, and today was no different. However, after a couple matches had ended, two youngsters walked onto the stage and caused an uproar.\u201cIsn\u2019t that person Long Chen? Why would he come here?\u201d\u201cYeah, yesterday he was almost beaten to death. Isn\u2019t it weird for him to be here today?\u201d\u201cHmph, I bet he doesn\u2019t want to live anymore and wants to get someone to beat him to death here.\u201dHis father Long Tianxiao might be called the Border Suppression Marquis and was this generation\u2019s military god, but the people who gave him the title \u2018military god\u2019 were the poor people who had to suffer through wars and conflicts.In the imperial capital, which was filled with rich people, everyone was in peace and prosperity; therefore, people didn\u2019t place Long Tianxiao, who was born in a commoner family, on the same level as them. And thus, only a few people in the entire imperial capital held respect for Long Chen.\u201cLong Chen, you piece of trash, why did you come back? Aren\u2019t you just holding up the action for no reason? Who would want to see your martial arts? Hurry and beat it!\u201d\u201cYeah, if you want to kill yourself then find somewhere without people. No one wants to see such a piece of trash, so stop wasting our time!\u201dIn just a moment, the audience of several hundred people were all cursing loudly; none of them hid their disgust for Long Chen.However, in an unremarkable corner further away, two maidens wearing veils were raptly watching him.\u201cSister, that one is your fianc\u00e9? Why does he seem so lacking? There are not even the slightest fluctuations around his body,\u201d observed one of the maidens disappointedly.\u201cHmph, if dad hadn\u2019t been so selfish, he wouldn\u2019t have arranged my marriage back when I still wasn\u2019t even born. It\u2019s truly irritating\u2026\u201d responded the other maiden.On the martial arena, Long Chen didn\u2019t even notice the two maidens who were spying on him, and he also did not respond at all to the jeers of the crowd. He merely indifferently looked at Li Hao.Li Hao pointed out the people\u2019s uproar and sneered. \u201cSee? You\u2019re an unwelcome piece of trash, and if you were smart, you would just bash your head in and die.\u201dLong Chen continued to only indifferently stare at him, not saying a word.Dong\u2026The sound of a bell rang out, signaling the start of the duel. When that bell tolled, life and death were separated by only a fine line.Due to the tolling of the bell, the originally rowdy crowd became silent; after all, it was a life and death battle. Who would know just when someone\u2019s life would end?\u201cSister, this fianc\u00e9 of yours doesn\u2019t seem to have any cultivation base while his opponent is at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation. Aren\u2019t you worried?\u201d The maiden asked.\u201cHmph, what\u2019s the point of me being worried? Him dying is fine. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me.\u201d The other maiden indifferently snorted. But although she said these words, she had already taken out an extremely strange and ancient silk net.\u201cHeehee, don\u2019t say you don\u2019t care, you\u2019ve already taken out your martial weapon. Looks like you do still care. And you know, although his cultivation talent is trash, he\u2019s not that bad looking. How about this, if you don\u2019t want him, you can just give him to me.\u201d the other maiden laughingly joked.\u201cHow can a person be just randomly given to you? If you like him, you can wait for me to withdraw from the marriage arrangement. After that, you can do whatever you want,\u201d responded the other woman angrily.\u201cHeehee.\u201dOn the martial arena, Long Chen from the beginning until the end had remained as calm as water. When compared to yesterday\u2019s him who had been gnashing his teeth in complete anger, it was as if he was a completely different person.\u201cLong Chen, with your death near, you decided to suddenly become calm? Don\u2019t worry, due to the stakes you proposed, I won\u2019t beat you to death today.\u201d Li Hao was extremely arrogant and confident.\u201cYou sure say a lot of crap. Hurry up and come at me, I still have things to do later,\u201d responded Long Chen in a slightly impatient manner.Because the entire audience was very quiet, every single word of Long Chen\u2019s managed to enter the crowd\u2019s ears, and in a split second everyone watching the martial arena burst into jeering derision.\u201cLi Hao, what are you still waiting for? Hurry up and beat this kid to death! He\u2019s really causing us to feel too embarrassed for him.\u201dSome of the people present recognized Li Hao, so they called out to him.A cold sneer appeared on Li Hao\u2019s face, and he was no longer hesitating; the power of his third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation completely exploded out. His foot pressed down slightly on the martial arena, and he immediately shot out towards Long Chen, punching out his fist.When Li Hao started attacking, the crowd below burst into cheers; the current Li Hao\u2019s appearance appeared very dashing and handsome.\u201cNice attack, it\u2019s the Wind Jade Tree Fist.\u201dSome of the people recognized the move and cheered. However, the distant two maidens\u2019 expressions were both filled with contempt and ridicule.Long Chen similarly also sneered. This kind of idiot move\u2014filled with mistakes\u2014could still be used against enemies?The fist was smashing towards him and a strong wind whistled as it approached, but Long Chen seemed to not notice it at all and didn\u2019t move even an inch.\u201cHaha, this trash doesn\u2019t even know how to dodge,\u201d sneered some people under the stage.However, just when that ridicule had just been shouted out, Li Hao\u2019s fist came to a complete stop just an inch away from Long Chen\u2019s face.The originally ridiculing crowd suddenly came to a complete silence. They noticed that one of Long Chen\u2019s legs had struck out and violently kicked Li Hao in the area between his legs.The originally beaming with happiness and elegant Li Hao now had an expression like a purple eggplant. Long Chen\u2019s kick clearly caused him an extremely severe pain, making his facial features warp and preventing him from moving.However, he might not be able to move from the pain, but Long Chen could. In just this brief pause, Long Chen grabbed Li Hao\u2019s hair, forcefully pulling on it while also strongly kicking out with his knee.SLAM SLAM SLAM!Long Chen completed his actions in an extremely refreshing manner and in a short time, his strong and fast rhythmic actions gave people a very intense show.The unpleasant sound of bones breaking came out from Li Hao\u2019s body. His nose was already caved in, his whole face was covered in blood, and he himself had already lost consciousness.For a moment, not even one voice could be heard from the crowd. Nobody had expected that a strong person at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation would be beaten by a trash, who had no cultivation base, in such a quick manner.Moreover, he had done it in the cleanest and most efficient manner. This kind of result was a firm slap in the face towards the crowd that had been ridiculing him.Even the distant two observing maidens were completely shocked. Although Li Hao was nothing to them and could be easily killed with a wave of their hands\u2026But Long Chen was not the same as them. From the very start, not a trace of spiritual energy had been used by Long Chen and he had completely relied on an ordinary person\u2019s abilities to defeat Li Hao.\u201cLong Chen wins.\u201dA voice came from an elderly man below the stage who was often in charge of the martial arena and its registration.Long Chen\u2019s stomach fluctuated rapidly a couple of times, and it was only with great willpower that he managed to stop and suppress the killing intent inside him. Right now was not the time for killing people.He had been oppressed for such a long time, and now that he had exploded out, it was hard for him to withdraw it. But as the rest of the world saw it though, Long Chen\u2019s actions appeared to be from lack of strength like he was gasping for breath.Long Chen walked off the stage to the elderly man and received the sword that he had used as his stakes as well as a crystal card with five thousand gold coins on it.The rules here stated that they had to hand in the stakes to the referee before the match; in order to show that it was equitable and also lowering the chance of anyone backing out during the battle.After receiving the martial sword, Long Chen directly returned it to Shi Feng. Placing the crystal card into his robes, he couldn\u2019t help but become somewhat excited.Although five thousand gold coins weren\u2019t very much, it could help settle a bit of the desperate situation his family was in. It had been very long since they had received a stipend from the empire, and nowadays the Long family was quickly reaching the point where they couldn\u2019t even afford decent food to eat.Under the attentive gazes of countless people, the two of them unhurriedly left. The two maidens watched Long Chen leave and immediately afterward, they also disappeared.The news that Long Chen had beat Li Hao seemed to gain legs as it rapidly spread. In just a short time, the entire imperial capital learned of it. The news puzzled countless people; how could a trash who couldn\u2019t practice martial arts possibly have become this difficult to deal with?But even with so many people personally seeing it as well as the news that Li Hao had to be carried back to his estate, quite a few people were still incapable of completely accepting it.Long Chen had wanted to split his earnings with Shi Feng, but Shi Feng was completely unwilling. In the end, he quickly made an excuse that he had things to do before hastily leaving, not even asking Long Chen how he had suddenly become so powerful.Remembering this favor in his heart, Long Chen directly went to the Hundred Herb Market. Entering into the Hundred Herb Market, Long Chen requested a catalog of their medicinal ingredients.On it were very clear recordings of the various medicinal ingredients\u2019 names and prices. Long Chen saw the majority of the medicinal ingredients required to refine the FengFu Pill[1]. It was quite lucky that the medicinal ingredients for the FengFu Pill were not especially uncommon.However, looking at the price, Long Chen\u2019s heart practically dripped blood. The gold coins he had now were only enough to buy three portions of the medicinal ingredients.But he couldn\u2019t spend it all on these medicinal ingredients since he still needed to buy a medicinal furnace for refining, as well as to buy some other spare medicinal ingredients. The few gold coins he had were like a cup of water trying to put out a burning cart.However, not buying it was also unacceptable, so Long Chen clenched his teeth and spent twelve hundred gold coins to buy a bronze furnace of the worst quality.He also bought one set of the medicinal ingredients for the FengFu Pill as well as a large amount of medicinal ingredients for the Energy Recovery Powder. By the time Long Chen left the Hundred Herb Market, the amount on his crystal card was only five hundred gold coins.After returning home, Long Chen went right to his own room. Firmly locking the door, he ordered Bao-er to tell everyone that he was not to be disturbed.He knew that his mother would hear the news that he had once again gone to compete in martial arts. Afraid that his mother would worry, he purposely told Bao-er to block her. In any case, nothing had happened to him, and his mother shouldn\u2019t become too concerned.Right now, he had to seize every second of every minute to quickly increase his strength. He was sure that the current Long family\u2019s predicament was not as simple as it seemed, and he sensed the coming of a crisis.The spiritual energy in Long Chen\u2019s body started moving, and a cluster of flame appeared within his hand. This was a pill cultivator\u2019s agglomerated Pill Flame. But when Long Chen saw this ball of flame, he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry; this flame was far too weak. The Pill Flame was formed from a pill cultivator\u2019s spiritual energy, and through special operating methods it was condensed into a spiritual energy flame. However, the current Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame\u2019s temperature was extremely low, even when compared to other ordinary Pill Flames.In addition, Long Chen found that without his Dantian to support him, he couldn\u2019t maintain the Pill Flame for more than a quarter of an hour, which was far from enough time to refine medicinal pills.Long Chen bitterly smiled. However, luckily he had his backup plan, which was first refining the Energy Recovery Powder. Placing the medicinal ingredients into the furnace, he refined them one by one. This time, he didn\u2019t use his Pill Flame, but instead used a normal fire from the wood.When all the medicinal ingredients had been refined, he placed them into a jug of water to form Energy Recovery Liquid and after resting for a short period of time, Long Chen took a deep breath and prepared himself to officially begin the refining of FengFu Pill.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 Condensing the FengFu StarPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeNine Yin Grass, refinement complete.Earth Dragon Root, refinement complete.Flame Seed, refinement complete.\u2026Over thirty types of medicinal herbs were refined one by one, using up over two hours of Long Chen\u2019s time and causing him to be covered in sweat.Refining pills was not the same as simply decocting medicine. Every single medicinal herb\u2019s essence had to be extracted while at the same time removing the impurities, forming a powder.However, the flame in Long Chen\u2019s hand was of far too low of a quality and the refined powder still retained too many impurities to be ideal. Still, this was the only method that he had.First of all, Long Chen\u2019s cultivation base was nonexistent, and thus he didn\u2019t have the necessary strength to sustain the Pill Flame, making its strength weak.Second of all, currently, Long Chen didn\u2019t have the opportunity or capability to subdue a different flame, so he could only settle for what he had.But wanting to train in alchemy methods required not only a strong Pill Flame but also forceful spiritual energy, and the most important requirement was an exceedingly powerful Spiritual Strength.The other two requirements were not that difficult. As for the Pill Flame, as long as you made all the proper preparations, you could seize a fire-attribute Magical Beast and gradually tame it into a house pet. Drawing on the Magical Beast\u2019s flame, you could subdue it and cultivate it to become your own flame.Over ninety-nine percent of capable alchemists used beast flames. Only a handful of people, who possessed extremely ancient inheritances of powerful strength, could control those extremely mysterious and mystical Spirit Flames found within heaven and earth.Spirit Flames were flames that possessed their own soul and according to Long Chen\u2019s memories, he had previously controlled an extremely formidable Spirit Flame.But no matter how formidable he was in the past, right now he could only use this trash flame for his pill refining. After all, the things in his memories were not things he could take out.After resting enough, Long Chen took a deep breath. He placed a candle into his hand and a yellow flame appeared.\u201cNot bad, after going through the refinements, the flame\u2019s strength has increased by a slight amount. Whatever, it\u2019s better than nothing I guess.\u201dAfter consecutively refining seven different medicines\u2019 essence, he threw them into the furnace. His Spiritual Strength erupted out and the flame in Long Chen\u2019s hand suddenly fluctuated. Compared to before, it was now several times stronger.\u201cUsing Spiritual Strength to support the flame. If other alchemists saw this, wouldn\u2019t they get shocked to death?\u201d Long Chen bitterly smiled.Spiritual Strength was the foundation of any pill refinement. At the time of refining, a large amount of Spiritual Strength was needed in order to control the temperature. If even a slight deviation occurred, it would waste all of your previous efforts and you would end up refining a pile of pill ashes. Moreover, if the medicinal pill had a very large medicinal strength, then you might even cause a furnace explosion.Most alchemists wouldn\u2019t start using their Spiritual Strength right at the beginning of the refinement. They would only use it towards the latter stages, when the pill was about to take form in order to very carefully control the flame\u2019s strength.After all, that was the critical time in the formation of the pill. At that time, the flame\u2019s temperature had to constantly change, sometimes high and sometimes low, and doing so required a large consumption of Spiritual Strength.If at that time, the alchemist\u2019s Spiritual Strength was already exhausted, then the furnace of pills could basically be considered as scrapped. However, Long Chen actually started using his Spiritual Strength right at the beginning of the refinement.In addition, he used this precious Spiritual Strength just in order to increase the flame\u2019s power, treating it like firewood. Any alchemist would definitely rage and curse at him for doing so. Even if someone was a reckless and frivolous spender, no one would actually spend it like this.But Long Chen wasn\u2019t worried. According to his memories, his Spiritual Strength was already not lacking compared to ordinary alchemists.Pill cultivator ranks were Pill Apprentice, Pill Adept, Pill Master, Pill King, Pill Emperor, Pill Ancestor, Pill Venerate, Pill Saint, and Pill God.The FengFu Pill was a first tier medicinal pill and generally, pill cultivators who had reached the Pill Apprentice rank could refine a first tier medicinal pill.Long Chen\u2019s current memories also included those of a Pill God, so he was completely clear on his current capabilities. When Long Chen had awoken, his Spiritual Strength had changed to become abnormally strong compared to his previous trash self; therefore, Long Chen was qualified to use his Spiritual Strength in such a manner.The pill furnace in front of Long Chen faintly trembled, emitting a slight buzzing noise.\u201cHehe, by increasing the power of the flame, the speed has increased by quite a bit.\u201dHe hastily threw in three more medicinal ingredients into the furnace; however, Long Chen\u2019s forehead was already perspiring at this moment.Hurriedly taking out a straw, he placed one end into the medicine jar which was filled with Energy Recovery Liquid and quickly drank a mouthful.When the Energy Recovery Liquid entered his stomach, the pores all over his body opened and began to crazily absorb the spiritual energy between and heaven and earth. His originally about to be exhausted spiritual energy rapidly recovered.This was what Long Chen had prepared earlier. Without it, there was no way for him to refine the FengFu Pill. With his current level, it would be a joke if he could actually refine a pill on his own without some kind of assistance.With the straw in his mouth, every now and then he would draw in another mouthful of Energy Recovery Liquid to replenish his body\u2019s spiritual energy.With Long Chen\u2019s spiritual energy being replenished, his Spiritual Strength could show off how extremely powerful it was, and it was only two days later that Long Chen started to feel a bit exhausted. That was a sign that his Spiritual Strength had been largely used up.However, at this time, the medicinal ingredients had already been absorbed into the pill furnace, so all that was left was finishing up. The medicinal aroma was also starting to fill the air.Although Long Chen\u2019s impression of a first tier medicinal pill was that it was so easy to refine it could be done with his eyes closed, the current him was no longer the same Pill God in his memories. His destiny had already been completely changed and saying that he wasn\u2019t nervous would be a lie.Buzz.Suddenly, the pill furnace\u2019s interior started to vibrate, emitting a series of buzzing noises. The energy within the pill furnace also started to become berserk.Long Chen didn\u2019t become even the slightest bit panicked; on the contrary, he even started to smile. This was the indication of the pill\u2019s formation and also the most critical time of the refinement.His Spiritual Strength was completely activated with not even a trace of it held in reserve. The flame in his hand suddenly exploded out, and an incorporeal strength tightly sealed the entire pill furnace. This technique was called \u2018Heaven Seal Earth Lock\u2019 and was something that he had come up with from his memories. It was something used in order to prevent pill explosions and also, furnace explosions.Moreover, this technique was very practical and could in the shortest period seal the medicinal energy within the pill furnace, not letting too much leak out.Normal alchemists would all do this at the last step because when the medicinal pill would go berserk, it was possible to stabilize it by taking a more gentle action.Although doing so would decrease the danger by a lot, a large amount of the medicinal essence would be lost, and therefore, the medicinal pill\u2019s quality would just be ordinary.Bang!Following the full suppression of Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength, the pill furnace emitted a smothered noise. After that, everything turned silent.The pill furnace had already turned tranquil. Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but to gasp for breath. His whole body was drenched in sweat, and he was so dizzy that he felt the sky was spinning.When he felt a bit better, he excitedly opened up the furnace. His hand was even trembling as he picked out five extremely round pills. Holding them in his hand, a dense medicinal aroma completely filled the whole room.\u201cTwo low-grade pills and three trash pills. Tch, saying it out loud really makes me lose enough face to die.\u201d Long Chen\u2019s face was showing how excited he was, but he still sighed.Staring blankly for a bit, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He had a mixture of a lifetime\u2019s worth of memories from a Pill God along with the memories of his current self. Apparently, that Pill God was truly excessively arrogant.He himself didn\u2019t care about losing any face though, and he hastily carefully examined the pills in his hand.There were two low-grade medicinal pills with their bodies completely round and their pill aroma filling the air. The aroma refreshed the mind and raised a person\u2019s spirit when smelled.Long Chen couldn\u2019t hold back a burst of elation. After all, one successful medicinal pill could be sold in the imperial capital for at least ten thousand gold coins.In addition, even the three trash pills in his hand were much better than the medicinal pill his mother had bought for him, especially since at least thirty percent of the medicinal essence had been sealed into the pill.A medicinal pill that had locked in fifty percent of the essence would be termed low grade, and over eighty percent of all medicinal pills were only low grade.If the medicinal essence reached sixty percent it would be middle grade, seventy percent would make it high grade, eighty percent would make it top grade, ninety percent would make it peerless grade, and as for one hundred percent\u2026 hehe. Right now Long Chen didn\u2019t think too much about it as it was simply too far for his current self.Some people might wonder about the difference between fifty and sixty percent content of medicinal essence. Was it a significant difference?Wouldn\u2019t consuming two low-grade medicinal pills be much more effective than one middle grade? If someone heard you ask this question, they\u2019d probably choke on their own spit.Inside a medicinal pill was not only its medicinal essence but also impurities. These impurities were unable to be absorbed by the body, and most importantly, these impurities would cancel out a portion of the absorbed essence.The saying that each medicine had its own side effects was not just a colloquial saying but a hard truth. During the formation of a pill, it was difficult to avoid accumulating pill toxins. These kinds of toxins, if not taken very often, would not have a large effect.But for cultivators, medicinal pills were often life-saving measures, and who would know just how many pills you would consume in one lifetime. When the body\u2019s pill toxins reached a certain degree, it would become a life-threatening poison.Pill toxins were one of the most difficult to eliminate poisons. They penetrated deep into the flesh and bones and even the spirit. But the higher grade a medicinal pill was, the fewer toxins it would have.It was for this reason that the medicinal effect of a middle-grade medicinal pill was over ten times greater than a low-grade medicinal pill. As for the price difference, it was at least a hundred times greater.After collecting the five medicinal pills and cleaning up the medicinal furnace, Long Chen could no longer endure it and collapsed into slumber.After sleeping for an unknown amount of time, he felt two hands caressing his cheek and could hear some low-pitched murmurings, but he was too exhausted and incapable of waking up.When Long Chen once again regained consciousness, it was already three days later. His stomach was growling with hunger, and he wolfed down his food before once again starting his seclusion.Consuming one trash pill, he used his Spiritual Strength to guide the medicinal pill\u2019s energy to enter the YongQuan point[1] on the bottom of his foot. That was the location of the first Star of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art - the position of the FengFu Star.BANG!Long Chen\u2019s left foot shook. The intense energy came from the bottom of his foot, and the ground under it became covered in cracks.\u201cExcellent, I\u2019ve already found the meridian channel as well as the exact position. Now I can genuinely attack it.\u201dLong Chen faintly smiled, and he took out a low tier FengFu Pill and directly consumed it. The pure and perfect energy erupted and under Long Chen\u2019s pull, it went straight to the YongQuan point on the bottom of his foot.The YongQuan point trembled. Following the rushing medicinal energy, it was just like a dry riverbed receiving water, and it crazily convulsed.BOOM!A booming noise reverberated, and the frightening energy filled Long Chen\u2019s whole body. The tyrannical energy exploded out of its own accord, shaking the room into smoke and dust, with waves of energy surging about.As the smoke and dust slowly scattered, it exposed a tranquil and refined Long Chen; his eyes filled with excitement. He could sense a pea-sized body on the bottom of his foot from which endless energy would flow out into his body, giving Long Chen a desire to lift his head up to the heavens and roar.The activity from Long Chen\u2019s room caused the entire noble estate to be disturbed, and everyone rushed over.Seeing his mother also coming over, Long Chen hastily said, \u201cMom, today is the day that the noble heirs can enter the Imperial College to study, I have to hurry over.\u201dAfter saying this, he left behind a group of dumbstruck people and a pile of destroyed ruins, as he changed into clean clothes and left directly for the Imperial College.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 Imperial CollegePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeThe Imperial College opened its doors one day every month for the imperial capital\u2019s noble heirs. In the morning, they would practice poetry and etiquette, and in the afternoon, the palace\u2019s martial arts depository would be available to everyone free of charge.The previous openings of the Imperial College held absolutely no meaning to Long Chen since even if he attended, he would just be the object of ridicule for everyone there.But now that was no longer the case. After consuming the FengFu Pill, Long Chen had already condensed an embryonic form of the FengFu Star.Although it was just an embryonic form and couldn\u2019t store that much spiritual energy, it was still able to store much more than what could be stored in just the body\u2019s meridians. After all, the meridians were like rivers while the Dantian was like the ocean that fed the rivers, even sometimes being called the \u2018energy sea\u2019.Although a river might appear large, its capacity was limited. Without the Dantian to support it, it would quickly be used up. But this problem was completely resolved with the condensing of the FengFu Star. And the most important thing was that now that the embryonic form of the FengFu Star had been condensed, as long as there was enough energy, it would eventually become a complete FengFu Star.At that time, Long Chen would have something unique to himself to use as a \u2018Dantian\u2019. This was the most unique point of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.When all nine stars were condensed, it would be equivalent to having nine Dantians. Anyone could understand just how powerful that kind of forceful spiritual energy source was.Long Chen was in possession of the entire Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Unfortunately, such a cultivation technique was something that defied the heavens, and his understanding of it was still very low, so he still needed to spend an endless amount of meditation on it.Once he managed to completely condense his FengFu Star, he would be able to store an extremely large amount of spiritual energy. Then he could attempt to agglomerate his blood vessels and enter the Blood Condensation stage, thus becoming a true martial artist.The Qi Condensation stage was just the first step of training in martial arts. Only by stepping into the Blood Condensation stage, having your blood and qi surge, and having your martial powers sharply rise, only then could you be considered a genuine martial artist.Long Chen didn\u2019t know what Heavenstage of Qi Condensation he would count as, but with the formation of his embryonic FengFu Star, his body\u2019s strength had been increased by a surprising amount.The current him could let out a very simple punch, and it would cause the wind to whistle, so much so that the force it generated would have enough power to break apart a vase even two meters away. Essentially, it was like his whole body was brimming with strength.His goal in going to the Imperial College this time was to enter the martial arts depository. With his FengFu Star\u2019s embryonic form, his body\u2019s spiritual energy had risen, and he could already begin to train in martial Battle Skills.These so-called Battle Skills were all created by extremely powerful seniors. They were powerful fighting techniques that used a person\u2019s spiritual energy, qi, and meridians.Battle Skills were extremely terrifying. They could allow a martial artist to release an extremely formidable power that was several times stronger than their ordinary strength. It was impossible to be courageous in front of them.Therefore, each Battle Skill was extremely important to a martial artist. Now that Long Chen had spiritual energy capable of training in Battle Skills, he was itching to obtain one.The Imperial College was located to the north side of the imperial capital. It spanned tens of kilometers, and other than the Imperial Palace, it was the grandest and most imposing building in the entire imperial capital.After Long Chen showed off his identification plate, he entered into the Imperial College and went straight to the literature hall. That was where the morning lecture took place and where the noble heirs would listen to the studies of the Dao from lecturers talking about everything and anything, from etiquette to poetry, and even to ancient theories of literature.Entering into the literature hall, he saw that due to how early he was, the extremely large literature hall only had several dozen people.\u201cHaha, brother Long, you came.\u201dJust as Long Chen entered, several youths came over and cordially greeted him.These youths were similar to Long Chen; for various reasons, they also had no way of cultivating. Although they couldn\u2019t be considered best friends, they were still fellow sufferers who empathized with each other.In the golden age of martial arts in the Phoenix Cry Empire, these youths might not have been bullied in such a miserable way like Long Chen, but they were also frequently sneered at and suffered from a cold and indifferent treatment.Thus, these people who suffered from similar torments ended up becoming closer to Long Chen. They were especially glad to see him now since it had been a long time since they\u2019d seen each other.\u201cHaha, you guys came here pretty early,\u201d Long Chen laughingly greeted. With the success of the condensation of his FengFu Star, his mood had improved greatly from the formerly depressed him.\u201cI heard a few days ago that brother Long put up a huge display of his awesome power, defeating Li Hao. Ah, you really make us admire you. Don\u2019t tell me that brother Long can actually genuinely cultivate now?\u201d one skinny teen extremely enviously asked.Originally, they were all the same level as Long Chen. Hearing that Long Chen could actually defeat Li Hao who was at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation, they were all extremely shocked while also feeling a slight jealousy.\u201cHehe, it was just luck. But most recently, I did learn a new Divine Technique.\u201d Long Chen didn\u2019t want to continue on this subject, so he brought up a new mysterious topic.\u201cDivine Technique? What\u2019s that?\u201d Sure enough, everyone immediately became distracted by this new change in subject.\u201cHehe, this little brother recently obtained a rare clairvoyance book, and after painstakingly reading this book, I learned quite a few things,\u201d Long Chen said somewhat complacently.\u201cClairvoyance technique? Isn\u2019t that just what the fortune tellers on the streets use to scam people?\u201d\u201cNot quite. With what I learned from that clairvoyance technique, I saw that Li Hao\u2019s face had a dark omen of misfortune on it, and it was only then that I decided to duel with him. And as for the result\u2026 hehe.\u201d Long Chen laughed and stopped there.Everyone momentarily was dubious for a moment when someone suddenly brightened with understanding and exclaimed, \u201cIt seems to be true! I heard that Li Hao seemed to have been bewitched that day, and his whole body didn\u2019t have even the slightest bit of energy before he was defeated by brother Long. \u201cThe details of Long Chen and Li Hao\u2019s battle were known to everyone, but there were many people who felt that Li Hao\u2019s defeat was quite a deep mystery. Nowadays, there was a great deal of discussion over Long Chen.\u201cHehe, brother Long, since you are proficient in reading faces, can you help take a look at me and tell me why my fianc\u00e9e always avoids me? Why won\u2019t she agree to see me?\u201d one person somewhat vexingly asked.\u201cNo problem. Come, come, let\u2019s first find a place for us all to sit. Standing here is somewhat unsuitable.\u201dTheir group found a table in the corner to sit at, and the table even had some refreshments for them.Long Chen pointed towards the table\u2019s desserts and laughingly told everyone, \u201cLet\u2019s all eat a piece.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the other people didn\u2019t stand on courtesy and all took a piece. Everyone seemed a bit confused as they looked at Long Chen.\u201cHow\u2019s the taste?\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat another piece?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThat person once again picked up a piece and took a bite. But when he had only eaten one bite, his face suddenly brightened, and he respectfully turned towards Long Chen and said, \u201cMany thanks for brother Long\u2019s advice. This little brother understands now. I was being too greedy and brother Long was reminding me that people need to be content with their situation, right?\u201dEveryone looked at Long Chen in admiration. Who would have thought that Long Chen had the profound skills to use some small desserts as food for thought? However, Long Chen still sighed and shook his head. \u201cWrong. What I wanted to remind you of is that you\u2019re already this fat, and yet you\u2019re still eating this much. Soon you won\u2019t even be able to fit through the door. The fact that your fianc\u00e9e is still with you and hasn\u2019t left you is already an enormous accommodation; you should be happy with just that. With a body shape like yours, any woman would be scared to sleep beside you. What if you roll over in your sleep? You\u2019d crush her so hard, she\u2019d turn flat.\u201dThat person\u2019s face reddened, and with Long Chen\u2019s reminder, he looked at his five foot tall height with his four and a half foot wide stomach. Apparently, he had previously felt that he had only fattened by a little bit.\u201cFatty Yu, don\u2019t waste brother Long\u2019s precious time; hurry up and go lose some weight. Big bro Long, hehe, how about you take a shot at reading my face?\u201d A different slender youth respectfully asked with a smile.\u201cOh, you?\u201d Long Chen made a big show of acting very seriously as he looked at him for quite a while before saying, \u201cYour face ordains that before you are thirty, you will be destitute and frustrated, but the good thing is that after you are thirty\u2026\u201dThat person became jubilant, saying, \u201cIs it possible that after thirty I can suddenly rise in my cultivation?\u201d\u201cNo. After you are thirty you will slowly become accustomed to your situation and will no longer be frustrated,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t help but to burst into laughter, but just as they were laughing, they suddenly saw two bitter eyes staring at them, causing everyone\u2019s laughter to break off.Long Chen had long since noticed that person. Turning around, they all saw Li Hao glaring daggers at them.\u201cSenior Li Hao, are your wounds better now? Congratulations! Your outer wounds are all healed, but what about your inner wounds?\u201d Long Chen asked, seeming deeply concerned.Li Hao\u2019s face twitched. That day, his face had been smashed flat by Long Chen, and he had needed to be carried home. The Li family had hurriedly asked for the help of an alchemist from the alchemist guild and paid an extremely large sum of gold coins to let Li Hao recover.Having money was truly good; in such a short time, Li Hao had already returned to a point where he looked the same as a normal person.But after Long Chen brought the subject back up, Li Hao\u2019s groin started to hurt as if he was remembering that one kick from Long Chen.At that time, Long Chen\u2019s kick had been very vicious, just a little bit off from turning him into a cripple. The thing that pissed him off the most though was that only after he got carried home and healed did he notice that he was missing a certain something. When his estate noticed this, they hurriedly rushed back to the martial arena, but by that time, they found that the arena had already been cleaned, and it was reported that that something had been taken away by a wild dog.When Li Hao had woken up and heard this news, he almost died from his anger. But now there was no way to fix it, and no matter how amazing an alchemist was, there was no way for them to fix what he had lost.What had been two was now only one. Although the loss of one family jewel wouldn\u2019t tilt him while walking, the loss of the originally symmetric pair was hard on him.And now that Long Chen had brought it back up, his face became exceedingly ugly. He glared daggers at Long Chen, his teeth grinding in fury. \u201cLong Chen, you son of a b*tch. I challenge you to a life and death duel! Do you dare to accept?\u201dLong Chen\u2019s originally amused expression tensed immediately. Being called in such a way was exceedingly insulting, especially since it also insulted his mother.It really was the case of not knowing to value one\u2019s life. Fine, if you want to be free from the mortal world\u2019s worries, then I\u2019ll help you.\u201cSame thing as before. I want to add stakes.\u201dLong Chen stared back at Li Hao. Since you want to die, you had best offer me up some benefits. Although they came from the same empire, he didn\u2019t care about Li Hao, and his death would be trifling to him.\u201cFine! No matter how high you make the stakes, I, Li Hao, will accept.\u201d Sneering in his mind, he thought to himself that no matter how high the stakes were, once Long Chen was dead, there was no way he could spend it. Li Hao was under the impression that last time he had simply been careless, and Long Chen had grabbed onto that opening and thus he had lost. Now he would definitely not make the same mistake, so this fight would definitely not go the same way as the last fight.In addition, this time was different in that he had declared a life-or-death duel; in last time\u2019s duel, although you would not be held responsible for killing your opponent with a blow, as long as the opponent conceded, it was not permitted to continue attacking them.But in the life-or-death duel, once the two people went onto the stage, it was equivalent to putting their lives on the line. Even if someone admitted defeat, it would be useless. The victor could do as he pleased. The loser\u2019s life would be in their hands.\u201cOkay, tomorrow, three quarters after noon, we will meet on the life and death stage.\u201d Li Hao coldly laughed, and when he looked at Long Chen, it was like he was staring at a dead person.Long Chen coldly sneered inside. Now was the time for him to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys. Seeing Li Hao leave, he slyly laughed, \u201cCareful to stay balanced while walking; don\u2019t trip.\u201dHearing Long Chen\u2019s words, Li Hao, who had already turned to leave, stiffened, and his face became contorted as he inferred the hidden meaning behind Long Chen\u2019s words.Taking a deep breath, he acted like he hadn\u2019t heard anything as he slowly walked to a different part of the literature hall.But Long Chen\u2019s words seemed to be like a steel needle piercing through his sensitive parts, and every time he lifted his leg, it would trigger memories of that bone-chilling attack.He continued to act as if nothing had happened, but the more he tried to do so, the more unnatural his gait became, which caused everyone to stare strangely over at him. In the end, Li Hao waddled away similarly to a duck.One person turned to Long Chen and reminded him to be careful, \u201cBrother Long, why did you accept his challenge? This is a life and death battle you\u2019re going into; one of you will end up dying!\u201d\u201cNo problem. Today I read his face and saw a dark aura of death around him. With it twisting around him, it\u2019s basically like a ghost sealing his life; he\u2019s doomed to die within two days. That\u2019s right, I now have something that I need a few people\u2019s help for,\u201d whispered Long Chen.Everyone exchanged glances and in the end, the person who had been nicknamed fatty Yu clenched his teeth. \u201cBrother Long, since you\u2019ve asked, I\u2019ll give you my entire savings.\u201dSaying this, he handed over a crystal card to Long Chen. Long Chen hadn\u2019t expected that this fatty Yu would actually have such a strong spirit of brotherhood with him. His crystal card had over eighty thousand gold coins on it.Although they were all noble heirs, mostly they were born in far off branches, so they weren\u2019t considered very important. These gold coins should be an extremely large sum to fatty Yu.\u201cFine, I have sixty thousand here, take it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have that much here, only thirty thousand. Brother Long, I only have this little capability.\u201d\u201cI have\u2026\u201dOriginally, Long Chen had thought that just borrowing ten or so thousand gold coins would already be quite a lot. He hadn\u2019t thought that they would actually completely empty their pockets to help him.\u201cEveryone, if by chance I were to die, then your money would basically be lost.\u201d Long Chen looked at the crystal cards in his hand, and he couldn\u2019t help but to give everyone a reminder.\u201cDoes brother Long look down on us? None of us are capable of cultivating, and every day we have to suffer through other people\u2019s torments. Brother Long, the fact that you dare go all-out in a battle against one of them means you have the courage that none of us possess. Even if we don\u2019t have your courage, helping you out this little bit is still something we can do.\u201dWhen these people saw Long Chen agreed to the life and death battle, they couldn\u2019t help but become excited since they were fighting a common enemy. Seeing Long Chen begging for help, they became even more heated and in the end, they didn\u2019t even care about the consequences.Long Chen nodded. He recorded this feeling in his heart as he held the over two hundred thousand gold coins in his hand.At this moment, a group of people walked into the literature hall, and the originally noisy literature hall immediately turned completely silent.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 Collecting InterestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeLong Chen turned to look at the people entering and his eyes turned cold. This group of people was hovering around one certain fellow, similar to how the stars flocked around the moon, groveling.He seemed to be carved out of jade and appeared extremely handsome. He was none other than the person who had beaten Long Chen on the martial arena to the point where he had almost died, the Savage Marquis\u2019s son, Zhou Yaoyang.Zhou Yaoyang was the noble heir of the Savage Marquis, and his cultivation base was at the peak amongst his peers. Therefore, his popularity was very high amongst his fellow noble heirs.Zhou Yaoyang immediately noticed Long Chen\u2019s group, and smiling slightly, he walked over. Looking at Long Chen, he said, \u201cMany apologies for what happened last time. I didn\u2019t expect that my one blow would cause you to not even be able to recognize your own mother.\u201dAlthough he spoke words of regret, his face didn\u2019t have even the slightest trace of apology. His words were filled with disdain, just like he was a king far above looking down on Long Chen.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Very soon I\u2019ll beat you to the point where you don\u2019t even recognize your own grandmother.\u201d Long Chen indifferently smiled, but inside he was secretly furious.When he had awoken that day, only his mother and that old alchemist had been there. Therefore, this news must have been transmitted by that old stick.Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s one sentence was equivalent to him telling Long Chen that the old alchemist had been one of his people. And furthermore, Long Chen\u2019s injury that day might have been extremely frightening, but in reality, it wasn\u2019t actually a life-threatening injury. Even the injury on the back of his head had only appeared bad due to the amount of blood, but it was not actually too severe.Therefore, there had basically been no point in using an expensive medicinal pill in order to treat it. The old alchemist had clearly been trying to frighten his mother and make sure that he could suck up all of their savings.Something like that basically had no benefit for himself, but instead weakened the Long family\u2019s resources. With their current living situation, it was like adding hail onto snow. To think that there was actually such a hidden plot behind his back\u2026\u201cLong Chen, are you looking to die? I think that you seem to have forgotten the pain now that your wounds have healed. Don\u2019t tell me you want to once again be beaten half dead by brother Yaoyang?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the trash who\u2019s incapable of cultivating actually dares to open his mouth viciously. He\u2019s obviously looking to die.\u201d\u201cWhat an idiot. Letting such an idiot count as a noble heir is just an insult to us.\u201dZhou Yaoyang didn\u2019t even need to speak before the people beside him began cursing Long Chen, their saliva spraying wildly.\u201cLong Chen, you might be a noble heir like me, but one of us is in the heavens while one of us is on the ground. You are just a small ant, and all you can do is stare up at me. Therefore, even if I am bullying you, all you can do is suffer in silence. Otherwise, the consequences will be just like last time, and you will end up being beaten into a dead dog,\u201d said Zhou Yaoyang, lifting a finger to point at Long Chen\u2019s nose.POW!Long Chen indifferently smiled, and suddenly, he extended his hand; before anyone could react, he tightly clenched onto Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s extended finger. Using a slight amount of force, a snapping noise rang out.Zhou Yaoyang emitted a miserable cry as the pain of his snapped finger shook his whole body. His Ten Finger One Heart technique was actually so easily broken and snapped by Long Chen!Even though he was a strong person at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation, as long as a person hadn\u2019t stepped into the Blood Condensation realm, they would still only be slightly stronger than ordinary people.In addition, he had been taken by surprise, so he hadn\u2019t had time to defend himself, meaning he was basically no different than an ordinary person.Long Chen condescendingly looked down on Zhou Yaoyang whose face was contorted in pain, and with a questioning tone, he asked, \u201cYou think you\u2019re above others? Others are nothing to you? Are you sure you\u2019re not talking about yourself?\u201dThe sudden unexpected turn of events shocked everyone, and Zhou Yaoyang was in such pain that he was unable to reply. Only then did the others react and throw themselves at Long Chen.\u201cBastard, hurry up and release brother Yaoyang!\u201d When the others following Zhou Yaoyang saw that Long Chen had dared to attack him, they all shouted and swarmed around him.\u201cWhoever dares come over will be beaten by me.\u201d Just as they were about to reach him, a large figure suddenly appeared beside Long Chen and furiously bellowed at the others with a thunderous roar, shaking their eardrums.Long Chen smiled when he saw who it was. Who else could it be but Shi Feng?The noble heirs, who were about to charge forward, stopped when they saw it was Shi Feng.Shi Feng was someone who was proud and aloof, and he didn\u2019t like being pulled into any certain social group. However, his cultivation base was top tier amongst the noble heirs, and adding on his large and superior stature, he managed to intimidate everyone back.For a moment, everyone descended into silence, and the only sound in the whole literature hall was the pained moans from Zhou Yaoyang.\u201cWhat are you guys doing?!\u201d Suddenly, an angry rebuke came over from the side, and an old man walked over. Everyone\u2019s expression became much more timid and respectful when they saw this old man.This old man was one of the lecturers of the literature hall. He was a Confucian scholar, and it was known that he was an honest and strict person, a dignified man who spoke few words.\u201cFighting within the literature hall is punishable by one month\u2019s custody. Do you guys want to try it out?\u201d the old man coldly snorted.Long Chen released Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s finger which was already crushed and bent. Hurriedly turning towards the old man, he smiled, \u201cTeacher, you\u2019ve misunderstood. We weren\u2019t fighting; we were just doing a test.\u201d\u201cOh? A test hmm? What kind of test?\u201d The old man obviously wasn\u2019t so easily hoodwinked, and he coldly questioned Long Chen.\u201cWe were testing how long the strength of one finger could hold out against the attack of five fingers. Through this test, we reached the conclusion that the power of cooperation is something that cannot be stopped. No matter how strong a finger is, it is still isolated. Its power will weaken from time to time, and only by relying on a partner can power be released in a steady flow, making it stronger and more enduring. This time\u2019s test allowed both Zhou Yaoyang and I to obtain an understanding of how to properly use the power of cooperation, and it will have an extremely large benefit towards our future cultivation. Brother Zhou, what do you think about these benefits, hmm?\u201d Long Chen summarized, as he stared with a hidden meaning at Zhou Yaoyang.Zhou Yaoyang was angered to the point of nearly passing out, but this grievance could only be swallowed by him, or if he denied it, he would be sent into custody with Long Chen. Even a noble heir couldn\u2019t break the literature hall\u2019s rules.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Zhou Yaoyang did his best to keep his voice calm, but the pain was causing even his voice to sound rough.The old man looked at Long Chen, and a trace of ridicule flashed within his eyes. But in the end, he still nodded and said, \u201cSince it was like this, this old man won\u2019t blame the two of you. But remember, in the future, you cannot make a ruckus in here.\u201dEveryone secretly sighed that Long Chen had good luck when they heard this. The old man clearly knew that Long Chen was just making up nonsense, but he still let them all go.\u201cHey, wait.\u201d Zhou Yaoyang clenched his teeth, and by using a voice that only the two of them could hear, he called out to Long Chen.Long Chen\u2019s hand attack had been extremely vicious; not only had it broken his finger, but in addition, he had used some kind of unknown method in order to turn the meridians within his finger into mush. Otherwise, Zhou Yaoyang would not be in such intense pain and end up as such a sorry figure without the slightest strength to fight back.\u201cBrother Zhou, feel free to come find me again to do some tests.\u201dToday is just a small payment on the interest I owe to you bastard. The worst is yet to come\u2026 But on the outside, Long Chen just courteously smiled.Over two hundred noble heirs calmly and quietly took their seats. The old man nodded his head in satisfaction and started the lecture. However, his material was vague and incomprehensible to them, and basically, all of it fell on deaf ears. It caused everyone to become drowsy, but no one actually dared to sleep.Although that old man didn\u2019t have the slightest cultivation base, within the entire Imperial College, he had the final say in everything. If anyone angered him, they would immediately be kicked out and could just forget about entering the martial arts depository in the afternoon.\u201cThis can be compared to chickens eggs; one has gone bad and one is still good. But if you want to eat the good egg, you have to eat the bad egg first\u2026\u201dThe old man continued to talk about all sorts of things\u2026 history, classical works, how to rule a flourishing nation, agricultural knowledge\u2026 even Long Chen almost dozed off.However, people like fatty Yu actually listened very attentively. They couldn\u2019t cultivate, so they had to rely on education for the future, hopefully obtaining some work with the government.Under this slow torment, the time slowly passed until it was noon. After eating lunch, everyone swarmed towards the Battle Skill Pavilion.Even the people who had no way of cultivating also followed. Within the Battle Skill Pavilion were countless Battle Skills and cultivation techniques, and going through them might offer them a lucky encounter.The Battle Skill Pavilion had three floors, but only the bottom level was opened to all the noble heirs.Even though it was just one floor, there were still seventeen bookshelves completely packed with all kinds of Battle Skills and cultivation techniques. It was a brilliant sight that dazzled people.\u201cBig brother Yaoyang, I already have a life-and-death battle agreement with Long Chen. This time I\u2019ll definitely kill him to help take revenge for you,\u201d Li Hao respectfully said. Who knew when, but Li Hao had at some point stealthily ran over beside Zhou Yaoyang.At this point, Zhou Yaoyang had already used his energy in order to suppress the pain in his finger, but the important thing was that the meridians had been fried, and so he had to find an alchemist to help him treat it.\u201cIt\u2019s still not the right time to kill him; otherwise, I would have killed him last time.\u201d Zhou Yaoyang shook his head. Suddenly he asked, \u201cThat\u2019s right, how did you end up getting beaten up by him last time?\u201d\u201cAi, actually, it was just me being careless, and Long Chen happened to catch that opportunity. The result really infuriated me; to think that the trash could actually beat me one time.\u201d Li Hao answered with endless regret.That one loss had caused his reputation to plummet, and the people whispering and gossiping about him behind his back drove him crazy with anger. He believed that last time was simply a small moment of carelessness, and so this time, he definitely had quite a bit of killing intent towards Long Chen.\u201cLong Chen cannot be permitted to die, at least not for now. Don\u2019t mess this up.\u201d Zhou Yaoyang worried that Li Hao hadn\u2019t understood, so he purposely repeated himself.\u201cThen what should I do? Just let him off like this?\u201d Li Hao somewhat unwillingly asked.Zhou Yaoyang looked at his twisted broken finger and grinding his teeth in anger, he said, \u201cAlthough you can\u2019t kill him, if you wanted to take back a couple of things on his body, that would be fine.\u201dWhen Li Hao heard this, his eyes brightened with excitement, \u201cExcellent! This time, I\u2019ll take what he took from me, and oh, I think I\u2019ll also take one his eyes too. Tch, seeing the expression in his eyes really pisses me off.\u201dZhou Yaoyang and Li Hao grinned, but they didn\u2019t notice that Long Chen, who was faking interest in the tomes, also smiled. However, his smile was much colder compared to theirs, like a leopard staring at two bleating sheep.From Long Chen\u2019s current position, he was perfectly placed so that he could use his Spiritual Strength to spy on what the two of them were talking about. Although he couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying clearly, but looking at their expressions, he could still infer most of it.Observing the two of them start acting like nothing had happened and begin browsing the ancient tomes on the bookshelf, Long Chen was also disinclined to go deal with them. Instead, he switched to looking for his actual objective.By now he had realized that the Pill God memories he had were actually extremely incomplete. Other than the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, the rest of it only pertained to alchemy. There were no Battle Skills, so he absolutely needed to obtain one today.Long Chen had finally settled on a Battle Skill and was just about to reach out his hand to take it when suddenly, a dark-faced fellow grabbed onto it before him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this book has taken my fancy.\u201dThat person didn\u2019t even look at Long Chen, and acting like no one was beside him, he started browsing the tome.Long Chen frowned slightly. This was done very obviously on purpose, but Long Chen didn\u2019t take action, instead switching to a different bookcase.Just as he saw a palm Battle Skill and reached out to take it, the dark-faced fellow who had long since been waiting to the side once again grabbed it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this\u201dPOW!A ruthless slap landed on that dark face, interrupting his words and sending him flying.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The powerful force sent him flying, and over ten teeth tumbled across the floor.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this tome has taken the fancy of this young master.\u201dLong Chen looked down at the dark-faced fellow with a face seemingly full of regret, apologizing with great flair.That slap was very resounding, and it echoed throughout the entire Battle Skill Pavilion. Everyone who had been busily browsing the Battle Skills immediately put down the manuals in their hands and turned in shock.\u201cWho dares to be so presumptuous as to act violently within the Battle Skill Pavilion?!\u201dSuddenly, a cold shout rang out, and a black-clothed man appeared from the inner part of the Battle Skill Pavilion. His face was cold and strict as he looked at Long Chen and the dark-faced fellow.That man\u2019s blood and qi surged just like a towering mountain, pressuring the others and making it difficult for them to breathe. Long Chen\u2019s eyes shrunk\u2026\u201cA strong Blood Condensation cultivator\u2026\u201dIt was unexpected that this place would actually have a hidden Blood Condensation realm cultivator. But thinking about it some more, this place was an important part of the Battle Skill Pavilion, and having a strong person keep guard would save them some worries.It was forbidden to practice martial arts within the Battle Skill Pavilion. This was a rule that everybody knew, and breaking this rule meant you would be taken into custody.\u201cSpeak, what happened here?\u201d The Blood Condensation cultivator angrily shouted.\u201cIf you want to know, then ask him.\u201d Long Chen didn\u2019t have the slightest amount of fear as he spread out his hands in innocence.The dark-faced fellow became indignant. It was obviously him who had suffered the blow, so why would he still need to ask him? \u201cSenior\u201d\u201cSenior!\u201dAt this moment, the distant Zhou Yaoyang hurriedly ran over. He reported to the Blood Condensation expert, \u201cSenior, it was like this: Wang Mang\u2019s face suddenly felt extremely itchy, so he gave himself a slap. There really wasn\u2019t any force or battle; you can check for yourself.\u201dThe dark-faced fellow who was called Wang Mang became bewildered. But just as he was about to say something, he saw the distant Li Hao doing his best to give him a meaningful glance, so he swallowed his words back down.\u201cYou\u2019re the Savage Marquis\u2019s son?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Yaoyang hurriedly nodded.That person nodded his head and looking at Wang Mang on the floor, he said, \u201cIf your face is itchy then just scratch it; don\u2019t make such a fuss. Clean up after yourself. I don\u2019t want to see such a situation a second time.\u201dAfter speaking, he turned and left, leaving a crowd of astonished people wondering why Zhou Yaoyang would actually help Long Chen.\u201cHaha, didn\u2019t you hear what he said? Hurry up and clean up your crap.\u201d Long Chen laughed as if he had totally expected this entire turn of events. Turning around, he walked away to continue looking for a Battle Skill.\u201cHateful bastard.\u201dLooking at Long Chen who downplayed this event, Wang Mang was angered to the point where his eyes were practically spitting flames. That one slap of his caused him to feel extremely vexed.\u201cWang Mang, endure it. If you were to open your mouth and accuse Long Chen of hitting you, then he would be taken into custody for one month, but after one month, he would be released safe and sound. However, if you swallow this anger now, then tomorrow, Li Hao will help you take back this face. Therefore, you must absolutely endure it.\u201d Zhou Yaoyang informed him.Wang Mang nodded his head. He knew that Li Hao had arranged a battle with Long Chen. But having bullied Long Chen for so long, he was already so accustomed to it that it had reached the point where it was just playing around.However, today, his playing around caused him to receive a huge slap in the face, and he didn\u2019t even have a place to complain. The anger from the broken pieces of teeth could only be swallowed into his stomach.A couple of people were busily picking up the scattered teeth and wiping off the bloodstains when Zhou Yaoyang suddenly asked, \u201cThe swelling on your face is very minor, so it appears that Long Chen\u2019s strength is still not very high. But how is that he managed to knock out so many of your teeth?\u201dThe others were also very suspicious. According to common sense, only an extremely powerful force could knock out such sturdy teeth.\u201cWho knows? It\u2019s completely ridiculous,\u201d Wang Mang gloomily said. What he didn\u2019t know was that Long Chen had used his knowledge as an alchemist. Long Chen was already as familiar towards a human body\u2019s physiology as he was with the back of his hands.His slap had been struck in a skillful way so that Wang Mang\u2019s gums would loosen, and the teeth on that side of his face had taken that opportunity to tumble out.Long Chen\u2019s attack had been very vicious. Teeth were not something that could be easily regrown; they were not like other injuries that could be healed with medicines. In the future, Wang Mang could probably only use the other side of his face to eat.Having learned from Wang Mang\u2019s mistake, everyone became much more well behaved and no one dared to once again provoke Long Chen.Long Chen was also happy to leisurely browse through these ancient tomes. The Battle Skills here could only be read in the pavilion and could not be taken outside.Spirit of the Bull.All Battle Skills could be divided into three categories: Heaven, Earth, and Mortal. And as for all these Battle Skills and techniques here, all of them were merely the lowest level of the Mortal category.Although they were the lowest level, these Battle Skills were still extremely precious treasures. Even though they were only for the high status noble heirs, it still required a Blood Condensation cultivator to oversee it. From this, one could see just how important Battle Skills were to the Phoenix Cry Empire.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a low grade Battle Skill, its usage of spiritual energy is clear and direct, making its effect pretty good.\u201dAfter completely reading through the Battle Skill in his hand, Long Chen nodded. This particular Battle Skill was very suited to him especially since he was extremely familiar with the body\u2019s meridians, meaning he could master it very quickly.He carefully read through it once again. His current Spiritual Strength was extremely formidable compared to a normal person, and it was a great assistance towards his memory. Essentially, he was almost at the point where he could remember anything he saw.The Spirit of the Bull technique was completely memorized by him. Placing it back, he saw a different support Battle Skill, Windchasing Steps.Windchasing Steps was a kind of footwork technique. Spiritual energy would flow through a set of specific meridians focusing around the feet, increasing one\u2019s speed and explosiveness. Whether it was traversing large distances or short evasions, this technique was extremely effective.\u201cExcellent, another practical technique I can use.\u201dLong Chen faintly smiled, and once again busied himself to carefully remember all the routes of the spiritual energy and the details of how to do so.\u201cTime\u2019s up, all noble heirs must place back the tomes. If anyone dares to secretly steal some, even death is not a harsh enough punishment!\u201dAt this moment, the Blood Condensation cultivator once again appeared. His cold shout was transmitted to everyone\u2019s ears, and everyone hurriedly placed back the tomes in their hands.Several people, who still wanted to continue, sighed and shook their heads. The Phoenix Cry Empire was truly exceedingly strict with Battle Skills. Every month they would only have half a day to study here.Many people had to spend several months\u2019 time just to learn a single Battle Skill. But although they were discontented, no one would dare to complain.Long Chen looked up slightly surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected that the time would pass by this quick. But if other people were to learn that Long Chen had used just a short four hours to completely memorize two Battle Skills, they might be shocked to the point that their jaws would hit the ground.Within the recordings of a Battle Skill, there were the extremely cryptic and difficult to understand portions, especially with regards to some of the terms about moving spiritual energy and qi around specific meridians. And what confounded people even more was attempting to practice moving their spiritual energy in such a complicated way while also reading.Leaving the Imperial College, Long Chen said his farewells to fatty Yu and the others before going up to Shi Feng and whispering a couple things.When Shi Feng heard what Long Chen was saying, his whole face burst into shock, and although he quickly suppressed it back to his normal expression, he was unable to conceal the shock in his eyes.Returning home, Long Chen saw that the room where he had condensed the FengFu Star had been cleaned up. However, it still wasn\u2019t safe for people to live in yet due to how heavily he had damaged it. Luckily, his family estate had many rooms, and they had prepared a new one for him.First, he went to his mother\u2019s room in order to assure her that he was alright. Many things had consecutively come up during these days, causing Mrs. Long to become agitated and worried.Ever since Long Chen woke up, it seemed like he had changed and become a completely different person, causing her to feel a bit of unfamiliarity.However, the good thing was that Long Chen had already adjusted himself now, and after accompanying and talking to his mother for a while, she calmed down by quite a bit. Nonetheless, he didn\u2019t tell her about the life and death battle that he had arranged with Li Hao.Leaving his mother\u2019s side, Long Chen returned to his room. Locking his door, he directly swallowed the second FengFu Pill.Following the absorption of the second FengFu Pill, the FengFu Star on the bottom of Long Chen\u2019s foot once again expanded ever so slightly.Along with the expansion, the FengFu Star\u2019s ability to store spiritual energy once again increased, just like a Dantian.However, the current FengFu Star was still in an embryonic form, and in order for it to reach a fully condensed form, a countless number of FengFu Pills were still required.That was also why Long Chen had been so dismayed when he had first gone through his memories and seen the method to train in the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.Currently, he had consumed two FengFu Pills that were worth several hundred thousand gold coins, and yet, his FengFu Star was still in its embryonic form. He was still extremely far off if he wanted it to reach the completely condensed stage. Furthermore, it seemed there was a level beyond even that, which was something he still didn\u2019t know anything about. Just the one FengFu Star was already a bottomless abyss that needed countless medicinal pills to fill.However, Long Chen knew that the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was the only technique he could use. If not, he would be just mediocre his entire life. In fact, he wouldn\u2019t even match up to an ordinary person since he didn\u2019t have a Dantian. Without using the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, his only fate would be to sink down to become a weak person that would constantly be taken advantage of.It took him four hours to fully absorb this FengFu Pill. His FengFu Star\u2019s embryonic form had increased slightly in size, allowing him to control a greater amount of spiritual energy.By now, it was already the middle of the night. Long Chen stealthily left his room and entered the firewood room. Taking a deep breath, he began to slowly train in the Spirit of the Bull. Long Chen was already completely familiar with his meridians due to those Pill God memories, so this low grade Battle Skill was something he could master immediately without even the slightest problem.He walked over to a stone grinder that weighed over half a ton and was normally used to crush up rice crops.Holding it with both hands, he lifted.\u201cRISE!\u201dThe huge stone grinder rose into the air, and Long Chen\u2019s impression was that he still had some leftover strength. Nowadays, his strength should be enough to lift around 750 kilograms worth of weight.However, his strength when Zhou Yaoyang had beaten him had only been 75 kilograms. Compared to before, it was a dramatic ten times increase.\u201cExcellent, not including other factors and just by relying on my current body strength, I can probably match up to people at the fifth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.\u201dLong Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel somewhat excited, and at the same time, he looked even more forward to training in the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Right now, he had only condensed an embryonic form, and his power had already raised by such an enormous amount; if he were to truly condense the complete FengFu Star, then just what kind of level would his power rise to?Hesitating for a while, Long Chen couldn\u2019t resist the urge to continue testing. Setting himself up, the air near his foot started to slowly fluctuate, and a scorching power swept from his foot and through his meridians, slowly collecting into his fist.Fist of the Bull!BANG!Long Chen\u2019s fist smashed onto the stone grinder, and with an explosive bang, the stone grinder was forced into the air and firmly slammed into the wall, causing the entire wall to break down.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but to foolishly stare at the powerful force. Originally, he had just wanted to experiment a bit with the power; he hadn\u2019t expected that it would cause such a huge disturbance.From outside the room, other people were all awoken and alarmed. Knowing that he had caused a huge disturbance, he quickly slipped back into his room and laid down to sleep.However, he was simply too excited to sleep, almost to the point of wanting to dance for joy.Nine Star Hegemon Body Art\u2026 Just what level had this cultivation technique reached? If all nine stars were condensed, then just what kind of power would be produced?Long Chen was simply too excited and ended up being unable to fall asleep the whole night. When the first glimmer of the sun\u2019s rising lit up his room, he slowly opened his eyes.\u201cHehe, you want to take parts of my body? That\u2019s quite a big dream; too bad you\u2019re not able to reach it.\u201dAfter rising and washing his face, he heard that the servants were still discussing what had happened last night in the firewood room. Welcoming the rising sun, Long Chen couldn\u2019t stop a certain thought from emerging from his heart:\u201cToday\u2019s a good day. I can accomplish anything.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 Life and Death BattlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeQuite a few people had already assembled around the martial arena. Other than some idle people who regularly enjoyed watching, there were also a few of the imperial capital\u2019s noble heirs.Today was the day of Long Chen and Li Hao\u2019s life and death battle. Although this place would normally see a constant stream of duels and fights, life and death battles were still very few in number.What was even odder about this situation was that despite that the two noble heirs who were fighting didn\u2019t have any remarkable cultivation bases, countless people had still come to watch.In addition, the Youlan Gambling Hall, the most famous gambler in the entire imperial capital, had also come to open up a public betting pool.Li Hao\u2019s victory: 2 times the odds.Long Chen\u2019s victory: 10 times the odds.Since no kinds of counterfeit could occur during a life and death battle, and adding their high statuses as noble heirs, betting on the outcome was extremely exciting to many people.Even some people who weren\u2019t gamblers also started to place bets, but for the most part, everyone bet on Li Hao\u2019s victory.Although Long Chen did defeat Li Hao last time, at that time, Li Hao was completely off-guard, and Long Chen had taken advantage of that opening. Such a miracle would not occur a second time.Only an extremely small portion of people, who liked to either mess around or were desperate, decided to take a long shot and bet on Long Chen.The betting place was located not far from the martial arena, and the section to bet on Li Hao\u2019s victory was completely packed with people, whereas the section to bet on Long Chen was completely deserted.\u201c300,000 gold coins on Long Chen.\u201dSuddenly, a large and lofty man appeared and tossed a crystal card over to the person in charge of the betting.\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe handler was completely shocked by this amount; throughout the entire morning, he had only collected ten thousand gold coins till now. Hearing this new bet, he almost didn\u2019t believe his own ears.That huge figure was, of course, Shi Feng. He had been entrusted by Long Chen to put all of his gold coins onto his own victory.Because of his status, Long Chen already knew that the Youlan Gambling Hall would definitely open up a betting pool, and so he had already preemptively told Shi Feng to bet on him.Even if the Youlan Gambling Hall ended up in a deficit from opening up the betting pool, he definitely wouldn\u2019t back out.Most of the money he normally earned was from his own personal bets, and as for these outer public bets, he didn\u2019t actually make much money off them. The main reason he had to hold public bets was to keep the people satisfied.And even if he were to take a loss, with the Youlan Gambling Hall\u2019s imposing wealth, it could easily be brushed off. It was for these reasons that Long Chen decided to join the betting.Originally, he had planned on just betting with Li Hao, but now he could get ten times the profit by betting with the Youlan Gambling Hall. Long Chen wasn\u2019t an idiot, so of course he knew which was better.Yesterday, with the help of fatty Yu and his friends, he had collected over two hundred thousand gold coins. When he had handed it over to Shi Feng, Shi Feng had seen how assured Long Chen was acting. Clenching his teeth, he increased the amount to three hundred thousand.Shi Feng\u2019s family was actually not very rich, mostly because they had a tendency to be rather hot-tempered and were not that good at handling business. The families of fatty Yu and the others tended to be better off.In order to collect this much money, he had actually used all of his weapons and armor as additional collateral.All of this was just for Long Chen\u2019s wild and crazy bet. Shi Feng couldn\u2019t hold back having his heart leap a couple of times in nervousness. Brother Chen, you have to stay calm and steady\u2026 all your brother\u2019s belongings have all been put on the line.Li Hao arrived just before noon. With a light push on the ground, he jumped several meters into the air to land on top of the martial arena, arousing a burst of cheers.However, this time the cheers weren\u2019t for his appearance, but rather because everyone was excited to see the start of a good show.Today, Li Hao was wearing clean and neat robes that were quite attractive, and a proud thought arose in his mind: Long Chen, the humiliation you\u2019ve given me will be returned to you tenfold!But even after quite a while passed after Li Hao went onto the stage, no one saw Long Chen appear. No one understood why he hadn\u2019t appeared, and some people began to wonder if perhaps he had chickened out.Just as everyone was wondering what was going on, an old man in charge of the martial arena coldly told Li Hao, \u201cYour appointment for your battle is for 12:45, so you\u2019re early by almost an hour. You can either continue to wait on top of the stage or you can come off to wait.\u201dEveryone booed in disappointment when they heard this, and the originally full of vigor Li Hao also became a bit dumbstruck as he had forgotten to check the time.\u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll just wait for him on the stage. In any case, he\u2019s a person who\u2019s about to die, so his remaining time is more valuable than mine.\u201dLi Hao indifferently smiled, and just like that, he sat down cross-legged on top of the martial arena, putting on the air of an expert. However, his attempt to maintain an expert\u2019s manner only lasted for a short while before becoming a bit strange\u2026Because it was noon, the sun was extremely powerful, and to make it worse, the martial arena was topped with black stone tiles, and by now, it was already boiling to the point where it could fry an egg.Since Li Hao had already sat down, he couldn\u2019t stand back up or it would ruin his act. Therefore, all he could do was suffer.Of course, some sharp-eyed people had noticed that Li Hao\u2019s bottom had already begun smoking slightly, and in just a moment, it became very obvious and the crowd\u2019s expression became very strange.\u201cThis guy is such an idiot; is he trying to save face? The fight hasn\u2019t even begun, and his butt is already burning,\u201d a maiden gently laughed. In the distance, two veiled women were indifferently looking at the martial arena.\u201cSpeaking frankly, he\u2019s just a phony,\u201d responded the other maiden, shaking her head.\u201cSister Meng Qi, we\u2019ve already been here for several days. When do you plan on withdrawing from the marriage agreement?\u201d asked the other one.The maiden who had been called Meng Qi elegantly creased her brows and somewhat awkwardly said, \u201cCurrently, he\u2019s in a very difficult predicament, and if I were to bring up withdrawing from the marriage to him at this time, then it would be too cruel. Even I don\u2019t know what I should do.\u201d\u201cBut delaying this matter isn\u2019t a solution. Master has already urged us several times. If we don\u2019t return to the mountain soon, then we\u2019ll probably be punished. Furthermore, with big sister\u2019s talent, you\u2019ll definitely reach Xiantian and be able to touch the Heavenly Daos. The two of you will be in completely different worlds; there\u2019s no way for you to work it out,\u201d sighed the other maiden.\u201cBut I still feel that doing it in such a manner is still extremely unfair to him\u2026 sigh, let\u2019s just watch a bit more.\u201d Meng Qi lightly shook her head, distress appearing within her beautiful eyes.As Meng Qi hesitated, they saw a disturbance within the distant crowd. Turning to stare, they saw a young man in black robes with sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes slowly walk up. His body seemed to have a unique aura, giving people a very profound feeling.He appeared just like a well; on the surface, he appeared like nothing was out of the ordinary, but it was impossible to see through him. No one could manage to see through his depths, and his existence appeared like a mystery to them.Even Meng Qi and the other maiden couldn\u2019t help but feel some fluttering in their hearts when they saw him. Compared to the Long Chen they had seen just a few days ago, it was like the difference between heaven and earth. The current him appeared to be full of self-confidence.Seeing Long Chen\u2019s arrival, Li Hao jumped up, feeling a burst of scorching pain from his bottom.Blaming Long Chen, his anger rose even more, and he angrily shouted, \u201cLong Chen, come up to die!\u201dLong Chen didn\u2019t even spare a glance for Li Hao, and instead, he scanned the crowd and met Shi Feng\u2019s gaze. Shi Feng gave Long Chen a slight nod.Not only did he see Shi Feng, but he also saw fatty Yu and the others who had apparently come to cheer him on.Long Chen smiled over to them before turning to walk onto the martial arena. Li Hao had jumped up to show off his skill, but Long Chen decided to simply walk up\u2026For the moment, the people who had bet on Long Chen\u2019s victory all felt that the money they had gambled was about to be lost forever.\u201cLong Chen!\u201d Seeing Long Chen walk up, these two words were angrily forced out of Li Hao\u2019s clenched teeth.\u201cIdiot, your butt\u2019s scorched, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Long Chen sneered at Li Hao.Actually, he had long since arrived; he merely stayed in the shade further away, and no one had noticed him. However, he had seen very clearly what had been going on on the stage.\u201c12:45 has arrived; both parties must sign the life and death contract.\u201dAt this moment, the old man took out a document, and Long Chen indifferently smiled and signed his name on top of it.This time was different from the last duel; conceding to the victor would have no effect this time. The loser\u2019s life and death were held within the victor\u2019s hands.Li Hao also signed, and with a sinister expression, he said, \u201cYou little bastard, today I will return all the humiliation you gave me one-hundredfold!\u201dNow that the life and death contract had been signed, there was no more need for a referee. The current martial arena had now become the ground upon which they would decide who would die today.\u201cLooks like you don\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve come to provoke me so many times, and I\u2019m not enduring any longer.\u201dLong Chen took a deep breath\u2026 an extremely dense killing intent appeared within his eyes. Ever since Zhou Yaoyang had first said that he wasn\u2019t Long Tianxiao\u2019s son, many people had started using the same kind of insult against him.\u201cGo to hell you son of a b*tch!\u201dLi Hao sneered, and with a loud bellow, his whole body\u2019s spiritual qi started to circulate, and the spiritual energy visible to the naked eyes could be seen fluctuating around his body.All of the crowd, who was watching, nodded when they saw this. Last time, Li Hao had been extremely unlucky; he hadn\u2019t made any preparations to protect his body, and Long Chen had used one quick attack to beat him. But this time, he had properly prepared and set up his defenses.Although this was only the spiritual energy of Qi Condensation and had no way of leaving the body, circulating spiritual energy within the body for protection meant that an ordinary person would have a very hard time to inflict any injuries.After Li Hao set up his defenses, a sinister smile appeared on his face. He charged towards Long Chen, both hands turning into claws aimed towards Long Chen\u2019s shoulders.These two claws of his were filled with spiritual qi, making them no different from iron fangs. If ordinary people were to be hit by it, their shoulders would immediately break.\u201cGood! Li Hao, completely cripple this son of a b*tch!\u201d From below the arena, a loud shout came from the person who Long Chen had sent flying within the Imperial College, Wang Mang.Wang Mang had now already lost half of his teeth while still a youth. And as for any bone-growing medicinal pills, those were far too expensive for his family to buy. Nowadays, he was already full of hatred for Long Chen and seeing Long Chen about to be assaulted, he couldn\u2019t hold back from cheering.But Shi Feng, fatty Yu, and the others all became extremely worried. From the very start, Long Chen had not shown even the slightest cultivation base, causing their hearts to momentarily get stuck in their throats.Long Chen coldly smiled as he looked at Li Hao. Taking one step, his whole body turned into a shadow as he charged forward towards Li Hao.BANG!You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 Alchemist GuildPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeBANG!An explosive noise rang out, causing everyone to become completely dumbfounded. No one had noticed how, but at some point, Long Chen had appeared right in front of Li Hao just like a demon. This was due to his Windchasing Steps. This technique increased his speed to the max, especially in close range, and the explosiveness was something that was impossible to guard against.Li Hao\u2019s two claws hit nothing while Long Chen\u2019s leg viciously kicked out and hit him between the legs with such a ferocious force that his whole body was lifted into mid-air.After the explosive noise passed, a little ball flew out of Li Hao\u2019s trousers and was flung towards the crowd.Wang Mang was still imagining Li Hao tormenting Long Chen and making Long Chen suffer a life worse than death. But the current situation completely shattered this delusion of his, and his jaw dropped, dumbstricken.He was completely oblivious to a small, grape-sized thing that was now flying towards his mouth. By the time he noticed it, the thing had already entered into his open mouth.Before he could even react, that slippery thing passed through his throat into his stomach, bringing with it a grotesque, foul smell.\u201cAHH!\u201dOnly now did Wang Mang react and desperately began using a finger to dig at his throat, causing him to vomit. After a while, a small ball was vomited out.When Zhou Yaoyang and the rest of the people beside him saw that ball, they also started retching, swiftly scattering away from it.\u201cAHH!!!\u201dOn the martial arena, Li Hao was tenaciously holding onto his crotch, his face twitching and contorting. If he hadn\u2019t set up his spiritual qi to protect himself, he would have long since lost consciousness from the pain.For a moment, the whole audience was completely silent. Everyone\u2019s eyes roved from Li Hao on the stage to the distant round thing on the ground, and their expressions became extremely odd.\u201cThis is good for you. Now you\u2019ll be able to walk without slanting and tripping,\u201d Long Chen said, nodding his head.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dLi Hao\u2019s furiously glared at him, wanting to tear him apart. His last family jewel was stripped off him, and now that it had entered Wang Mang\u2019s stomach, it had already been corroded to the point that even if he collected it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it.One was taken away by a wild dog while one was no longer usable; Li Hao was now destined to become a sterile person incapable of reproducing.\u201cYou fucker, go die! Stone Crushing Fist!\u201dLi Hao crazily roared, forcefully circulating his spiritual qi to restrain the pain coming from his lower body. His fist shot towards Long Chen, the wind whistling as it passed.The full power of his third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation cultivation base exploded out. By now, he had already descended into madness and completely forgotten about Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s instructions. The only thing on his mind was to completely destroy Long Chen.Seeing Li Hao became completely berserk, a cold killing intent appeared within Long Chen\u2019s eyes. He roared, the sound like violent thunder capable of shocking the sky, blasted the surrounding people\u2019s ears.An incorporeal aura engulfed Long Chen. Not taking any actions to avoid it, he also attacked with a fist.\u201cSpirit of the Bull!\u201dBOOM!!!An explosion was followed by the sound of bones breaking. Li Hao let out a miserable scream, his blood flying everywhere. People were shocked and horrified to see that one of Li Hao\u2019s arms had been completely crushed.Long Chen was still resting in his punching position. His eyes were icy cold and completely apathetic. A terrifying killing intent spilled out from him, shaking people\u2019s souls.The current Long Chen seemed like a cold-blooded death god. His whole body brimming with an icy cold killing intent that caused everyone to tremble in fear.The whole crowd was deathly still. The amount of power that he had released just now was something that even Zhou Yaoyang at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation felt somewhat afraid of.\u201cHow is this possible?! He can use Battle Skills?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it impossible for him to cultivate? What the hell is happening?\u201d\u201cHis expression is absolutely terrifying!\u201dPeople were unable to hold back their shock, and as for the ones who had previously ridiculed and sneered at Long Chen, they were all completely filled with dread. Seeing Li Hao lying on the martial arena, it was like they were seeing images of themselves. They couldn\u2019t help but to tremble, their spirits shivering.Even Long Chen himself was somewhat shocked. It appeared that even he had underestimated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art; otherwise, if it was a normal person using a low grade Battle Skill, it would not be able to release such a terrifying strength.Slowly walking over towards Li Hao, each of Long Chen\u2019s steps rang out loud and clear. The sound of it was like the overture of a murderer, each step pressing down on the people\u2019s hearts.Step\u2026 step\u2026 step\u2026By now, Li Hao\u2019s previous expression of anger had vanished, replaced with complete terror. Shaking and quivering, he stuttered, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t come over!\u201dLi Hao wanted to run away, but the completely terrified him only noticed now that his body couldn\u2019t exert even the slightest strength. To him, Long Chen who was slowly but gradually walking closer to him was like a nightmare which he couldn\u2019t run away from.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t kill me! It was because of Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s instructions!\u201d Li Hao sobbingly begged.Below the stage, Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s expression changed, and he angrily shouted, \u201cLi Hao, what nonsense are you saying?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying nonsense. You told us to handle Long Chen and that afterward, you\u2019d give us some benefits! All of this is because of you!\u201d Li Hao pointed towards Zhou Yaoyang as he hysterically rambled. In the face of death, he had already forgotten everything.\u201cLi Hao, you\u2019re asking for death!\u201d Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s face turned ashen, and his two eyes were filled with killing intent.\u201cZhou Yaoyang, you bastard! You used me for your advantage! Long Chen, I\u2019ll tell you. Zhou Yaoyang is nothing more than a henchman dog, in reality\u201dLong Chen suddenly felt a chill in the air ordaining an attack; sensing the air of death, he quickly retreated without even thinking about it.However, even after Long Chen had retreated, it didn\u2019t appear like anything had happened. But when Long Chen once again looked at Li Hao, he saw that Li Hao\u2019s eyes had already lost focus, and he had already taken his last breath.Long Chen\u2019s expression changed slightly; turning to look at the crowd, all he managed to see was a figure wearing a conical bamboo hat who was quickly fleeing the scene. With just a few strides, he had already disappeared from the crowd.The unexpected events caused an uproar amongst the crowd. Obviously, that mysterious figure had killed Li Hao!\u201cLong Chen wins!\u201dAfter a brief spell of confusion, the martial arena\u2019s overseer still ended up announcing this final outcome.Although Li Hao wasn\u2019t killed by Long Chen, Long Chen had already defeated him. If he had wanted to kill Li Hao, it would have been as easy as turning his hand, so in the end, they still announced that it was Long Chen\u2019s victory.Following Long Chen\u2019s victory, countless people sighed in regret. With this outcome, they had no way to take back their bets.As for the tens of people who had bet on Long Chen, they all crazily shouted in joy. Fatty Yu and the others shouted out especially loudly.Lying on the martial arena, Li Hao would never again be paid any attention to. The martial arena\u2019s organizers would send a message to his family, and they would come to pick up his dead body.The life and death battles were all protected by the imperial capital. No one was allowed to secretly take revenge. Li Hao was only a low-born noble whose status was not especially high. If he died, then he died; there would not be any waves following his death. This was one of the unbreakable rules of the imperial capital.Long Chen walked off the stage, receiving a heroic welcome from fatty Yu and the others. Shi Feng tightly hugged him.\u201cYou brat, when did you become so strong? And you didn\u2019t even tell anyone about it! My heart almost leaped out watching you,\u201d grumbled Shi Feng.\u201cBrother Long - no wait, elder brother Long, in the future, we\u2019ll all be muddling along with you; you have to cover for us,\u201d said fatty Yu and the others with bright eyes.Long Chen laughed, \u201cOf course. Come on, let\u2019s go to the betting place.\u201dIn front of countless admiring stares and everyone\u2019s cheers, Long Chen received no less than three million gold coins.At the moment when the crystal card with three million gold coins landed in his hand, Long Chen was actually even more excited than when he had been beating Li Hao.He had known that Li Hao was nothing more than a little dog. But the words that he had said right before he had died caused Long Chen to become even more cautious than before.Originally, he had thought that all the bullying had been because of enmities with his parents\u2019 generation, but that didn\u2019t match with what Li Hao had said. It seemed that it was not such a simple affair as he had thought; most likely, he was just a single pawn.He was just a trashy teen, and his family was completely impoverished now. There was no need for someone to actively plot against him in such a deliberate and methodical manner. The clear reason would be due to someone clashing with his father who was stuck guarding the barbarian border.\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s very complicated\u2026\u201dBut staring at the three million gold coins in his hand, Long Chen was filled with endless confidence. Was that the confidence that came with being rich?Leaving with the huge crowd, Long Chen found a teahouse and invited his friends to eat whatever they wanted and returned them their money.However, the money that had been earned was kept with him. Long Chen gave his friends a promise that caused them to be endlessly excited:Everyone\u2019s future cultivation would all be taken care of by him.This caused fatty Yu and the others to go mad with joy. They were all completely incapable of cultivating, and if someone else promised this to them, then they wouldn\u2019t believe it.However, Long Chen was originally the same as them. Now that he had managed to dispatch Li Hao in such a quick way, how could they not believe him?Hearing Long Chen promise this, everyone was overjoyed. However, Long Chen told them to keep this secret, and they all frantically nodded.Their future cultivation was something that was basically just as important as their life, and adding on to how solemn Long Chen\u2019s words were, they would not dare to treat it unimportantly.After fatty Yu and the others left, Long Chen stayed behind to chat a bit with Shi Feng. Shi Feng was a genius whose aptitude was the greatest amongst all the noble heirs. He was already at the eighth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation and could enter into the ninth Heavenstage at any time. Entering the Blood Condensation stage before twenty should not be that difficult for him.Through how Shi Feng had acted during these last two matters, Long Chen knew that he was definitely a person deserving his trust. After asking about Shi Feng\u2019s current stage of cultivation, Long Chen split up with him and went directly to the alchemist guild.The alchemist guild was in the south part of the imperial capital. It was the most sacred part of the entire imperial capital. Not even members of the royal family would dare to be rude towards the members of the alchemist guild.Alchemist guilds were said to be spread throughout the entire world, and as for the guild in the imperial capital, it was nothing more than one of their branches.What Long Chen needed to get this time was an alchemist\u2019s official identification. Having that status would mean that in the future, it would be extremely easy and convenient for him to do what he wanted.No matter where you went, alchemists were an extremely scarce occupation. With this identification, Long Chen\u2019s status would no longer be the same. Even the Phoenix Cry Empire would have to think carefully before they would act against him.The most important thing was that he could use an extremely favorable price and get a preferential treatment when buying the alchemist guild\u2019s rare ingredients, letting him save the maximum amount of money.Although the alchemist guild only took up a few tens of acres of ground, it rose dozens of meters into the air, making it extremely imposing and causing people to revere it.Entering the lobby, two maids received Long Chen. They were surprised when they heard that he wanted to take the examination for an alchemist identification.After all, Long Chen appeared to be only fifteen or sixteen years old, and he didn\u2019t have any fluctuations of a cultivation base. However, the two of them still brought him into the refining hall.At this time, the refining hall only had a dozen or so men inside. They were currently urging on their Pill Flames, appearing to be refining medicines.\u201cHuh? Why are you here?\u201dJust as Long Chen entered, an old man asked with an astonished expression.When he saw that person, Long Chen\u2019s heart erupted with a concealed anger. That old man was precisely the one who had treated his wounds. This person had clearly known that his injury had been no big deal, but by saying that he could possibly lose his memory, he managed to con his mother into selling her jewelry.\u201cI came here to take the alchemist exam.\u201d Long Chen calmed the anger in his heart. He\u2019d pay back the bill to this old man later.\u201cAlchemist exam?\u201d The old man examined Long Chen from top to bottom. \u201cLooks like your wounds from last time still aren\u2019t healed. You should go back and heal them.\u201dLong Chen frowned slightly and insisted, \u201cI really am here to take the alchemist exam.\u201dThe old man\u2019s expression sunk. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to waste on a little kid! Hurry up and beat it! Otherwise, I\u2019ll get the guards to throw you out!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s anger once again exploded. Glaring at the old man he shouted, \u201cIf your ears aren\u2019t completely deaf yet, then I\u2019ll repeat myself one more time: I am here to take the alchemist exam!\u201dBy the end, Long Chen\u2019s shout was already a roar that reverberated through the entire alchemist guild.\u201cWhat person is making such a loud ruckus?\u201dSuddenly, a thin old man walked over with a displeased expression. When Long Chen turned his eyes and saw him, a naughty grin appeared on the corner of his mouth.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the imperial capital, there were only a few people who wouldn\u2019t recognize him the alchemist guild\u2019s chairman, grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201cSenior Yun Qi, this brat suddenly ran over to make trouble. I was just about to expel him,\u201d the old man hurriedly explained when he saw grandmaster Yun Qi.Long Chen rolled his eyes. Feigning an extremely grateful expression, he said, \u201cYou are grandmaster Yun Qi? Wonderful, Long Chen thanks you for the favor of saving his life.\u201dOriginally Yun Qi\u2019s expression was displeased, but hearing Long Chen say this, he couldn\u2019t help but become distracted, asking, \u201cChild, are you misrecognizing me as someone else?\u201cMisrecognizing? No, definitely not.\u201d Long Chen shook his head. Pointing towards the old man, he said, \u201cThrough this grandmaster, my mom paid several thousand gold coins to buy a Tiger Bone Pill from you. Only through this was I able to recover from my wounds. This little one truly cannot thank you enough.\u201dHearing Long Chen recount this affair, the old man\u2019s expression immediately changed and Yun Qi\u2019s expression turned cold. Looking at the old man he said, \u201cGuan Cheng, what is this about?\u201d\u201cSenior chairman, don\u2019t listen to his rubbish\u201d Guan Cheng hurriedly tried to explain.\u201cHuh, why aren\u2019t you acknowledging it? To think that the people of our alchemist guild are of such a noble character than they don\u2019t even put their names on the good deeds they do. Only, the matter of you selling my mother a defective grade Tiger Bone Pill is very well known.\u201d Long Chen coldly smiled.Although Guan Cheng was continuously shooting Long Chen meaningful glances, Long Chen continued to act as if he hadn\u2019t noticed. Did you really think my Long family\u2019s money was so easy to swindle?Guan Cheng was currently a senior member of the alchemist guild. He was taught a bit by grandmaster Yun Qi, but he wasn\u2019t someone extremely talented.However, after Guan Cheng had carefully and attentively followed Yun Qi for a few decades, Yun Qi had felt some pity for him and given him the position of an attendant with some low-grade random jobs to do in the alchemist guild.Occasionally, when he refined a garbage pill, he would hand it over to Guan Cheng to handle. Normally, these garbage pills would have their useful portion extracted out for some medicinal liquids; they definitely would not be allowed to be sold on the market.This was related to the profession\u2019s personal integrity. If it was leaked that grandmaster Yun Qi had actually sold a garbage pill, then he would become a joke amongst his fellow alchemists.Grandmaster Yun Qi sighed. Looking at Guan Cheng he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve followed me for several decades, so you already understand my character. Leave and don\u2019t ever come back.\u201dGuan Chen\u2019s old face became deathly pale. His eyes holding a trace of unwillingness, he begged, \u201cSenior, I\u2026\u201d\u201cGo.\u201d Yun Qi indifferently responded, waving his hand.Guan Cheng nearly became paralyzed and fell to the floor. Yun Qi\u2019s declaration was equivalent to expelling him from the alchemist guild.An originally high and aloof attendant in a flash became someone completely lacking of anything. Guan Cheng appeared to age several decades.\u201cHey, I\u2019m talking to you; stop faking. You\u2019ve cheated and swindled people for so many years outside this guild. Right now, you\u2019ve already earned so much evil money that you won\u2019t even be able to spend it all before dying. Why are you acting like you\u2019re so deserving of pity?\u201d Long Chen disdainfully said.As an attendant of the alchemist guild, this old man had become extremely close to quite a few noble families. After muddling along for so many years, he had definitely obtained many benefits. Looking at his face caused Long Chen to feel sick and disgusted.Guan Cheng\u2019s expression became furious; his eyes filled with bitter resentment. However, he didn\u2019t say anything and merely slowly walked out with his head down.Watching Guan Cheng go away, grandmaster Yun Qi shook his head. Towards Long Chen, he said, \u201cThank you young man. Otherwise, this old man would still be completely in the dark.\u201d\u201cHehe, that old man was someone who cheated my family of one of our fortunes. I purposely came for revenge; there\u2019s no need to be so courteous.\u201d Long Chen laughed.Contrary to one\u2019s expectations, grandmaster Yun Qi replied, \u201cHaha, not bad. A young fellow who is so straightforward is clearly not suited for a treacherous and deceitful life.\u201d\u201cHaha, how could this youngster\u2019s intentions and manner be concealed for a whole lifetime? Since it\u2019s impossible to conceal, I might as well act like a good person.\u201d Long Chen spread out his arms candidly as he replied.Grandmaster Yun Qi couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Over his last few years, everyone would treat him with reverence. This was the first time someone would speak to him in such a joking manner, so now it was quite an enjoyable experience.\u201cLittle fellow, surely you didn\u2019t come to my alchemist guild just to report this complaint.\u201d\u201cOf course not. I came here to take the alchemist exam.\u201d After saying this, Long Chen held out his right hand.Puff\u2026A tiny flame leaped out of his fingertips. In order to leave a deep impression onto the grandmaster, Long Chen\u2019s hand trembled, and the flame started to act like a wild monkey, playfully leaping around.\u201cNot bad.\u201dOriginally, when he saw the flame, Yun Qi had only faintly nodded his head. Being able to agglomerate a Pill Flame at that age could be considered not bad. But Long Chen\u2019s following actions caused him to actually be somewhat moved.The ability to control the flame relied mostly on the amount of Spiritual Strength one had. Long Chen\u2019s ability to control it in such a lively manner demonstrated that his Spiritual Strength had surpassed an ordinary person by quite a bit.What he didn\u2019t know was that Long Chen was still holding back. If he were to bring out the secret arts from his memories, then he might completely terrify this grandmaster.\u201cVery good. Your Spiritual Strength is at least twice as strong as an ordinary person, making you a good sapling to learn pill refining.\u201d Yun Qi nodded.Hearing Yun Qi said this, Long Chen felt a weight fall off his shoulders. Being able to hold as much hidden strength as possible was still the best.\u201cCome, I\u2019ll bring you to do the test.\u201d Saying this, grandmaster Yun Qi brought Long Chen away.Looking at the two people leaving, everyone who had previously been in the hall refining medicines with their Pill Flames couldn\u2019t help being stunned.\u201cWhat? He didn\u2019t need to be appraised before directly going to do the test?\u201d\u201cHow is this possible? Is he a relative of grandmaster Yun Qi?\u201d\u201cNonsense, he\u2019s not a relative. Isn\u2019t that kid the imperial capital\u2019s famous trash, Long Chen?\u201dThe ten plus people in the hall were all there in order to take the alchemist exam, but according to the usual convention, they had to meet the requirement of refining a certain herbal medicine first to show that they met a certain qualification before advancing to take the exam.But Long Chen immediately skipped over this step, causing them to be incessantly furious. However, there was no alternative for them. This was the alchemist guild, a supreme existence. No one would dare do a thing; they could only swallow their anger into their stomach.In an underground room of the alchemist guild, grandmaster Yun Qi pointed towards a water crystal in front of them. \u201cUse your flame on it.\u201dLong Chen nodded. Extending a finger, he condensed a flame and placed it on top of the water crystal. Several lines appeared on the water crystal when the flame touched it.Grandmaster Yun Qi faintly said, \u201cYour Pill Flame has reached the low Huang class, just barely meeting the standard.\u201dPill Flames were split into Tian, Di, Xuan, and Huang class, with each class also having three ranks. Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame was agglomerated from himself and was not a beast flame or a heaven and earth Spirit Flame. Therefore, being at the low Huang class was very normal.Grandmaster Yun Qi then brought Long Chen to a shallow water pool. The water pool was only half a foot deep, and the bottom was covered with hundreds of sparkling pearls.\u201cCirculate your Spiritual Strength and see if you can cause the pearls to float up.\u201dObviously, this water pond wasn\u2019t a real water pond. Close examination revealed that the water was clearly spiritual mercury water. When Long Chen carefully touched it, he discovered that the water magnified his Spiritual Strength by greater than ten times.This immediately relieved him as his current Spiritual Strength was not strong enough to move objects without touching them. Apparently, he had been worrying too much.Circulating his Spiritual Strength, he immediately found a dozen or so pearls being influenced by his Spiritual Strength as they slowly floated up.Suddenly, Long Chen noticed that grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s expression was completely bewildered and shocked as he looked at those pearls.Damn, I\u2019m about to be exposed!Long Chen hurriedly released his Spiritual Strength. He used spiritual energy to make his face extremely pale like he was about to collapse, faking that his Spiritual Strength was overdrawn.\u201cGrandmaster\u2026 what rank do I count as?\u201d Long Chen gasped for breaths as he asked.\u201cXuan class\u2026\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi murmured. It was as if he hadn\u2019t even noticed Long Chen\u2019s current overdrawn state.Only a while later did Yun Qi notice that Long Chen was already weakly lying on the ground. If one had to give Long Chen\u2019s acting skills a rank, he would be \u2018God of Acting\u2019.Not only was his face as white as paper, but his eyes seemed weak and listless, giving him the appearance of someone who had excessively overexerted himself.\u201cExcellent, your Spiritual Strength is exceptionally strong. Your talent is definitely mouldable; I\u2019ve definitely found a good sapling this time.\u201d Yun Qi smiled.Long Chen\u2019s eyes brightened when he heard this. \u201cGrandmaster Yun Qi, this little one very much wishes to study the Dao of the Pill. Is it possible for me to become your official disciple?\u201dYun Qi shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t. Go carefully train and later, I will present an opportunity for you that will let you jump to the peak of the pill path.\u201dHearing Yun Qi\u2019s refusal, Long Chen laughed with embarrassment, \u201cActually, the main thing is I want a higher reputation so that no one will dare to bully me again when I go out.\u201dYun Qi stared blankly before bursting into laughter. Someone like Long Chen, who spoke so directly, caused him to not know whether to laugh or cry. How many years had it been since he had met such an interesting youngster? However, Long Chen\u2019s abnormal Spiritual Strength did cause him to have an excellent opinion of him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Later, I\u2019ll give you a Pill Apprentice identification plate; who would dare continue to bully you?\u201d Yun Qi laughed.Long Chen became excited. Normally, if a person wanted to join the alchemist guild, they had to first pass the exam to become a medicinal expert, and after that, they had to wait another year before they could obtain the qualifications to take the test to become a Pill Apprentice.Medicinal expert was just an entry-level rank, but it still caused countless people\u2019s eyes to turn red in envy. As for Pill Apprentice, it was the actual start of pill cultivation.\u201cWith your current Pill Flame and Spiritual Strength, it\u2019s still quite difficult for you to refine a pill. However, within a year, you will definitely be able to refine pills, so this can\u2019t count as violating rules; I\u2019m simply giving it to you a bit early,\u201d smiled Yun Qi.Long Chen was extremely grateful. Although in terms of technique and skill, he had enough mastery to look down on anyone, Yun Qi was definitely a senior who was worthy of respect.Grandmaster Yun Qi personally made a Pill Apprentice identification plate for him, and then in addition, he also gave him a medicinal cauldron and a set of pill robes. The pill robe was extremely luxurious, and there was a single embroidered pill star on the abdomen, the sign of a Pill Apprentice.The medicinal cauldron was made of fire copper and pure gold, and its design was very elegant. It was many levels higher than the old cauldron he had bought.Other than these two things, what pleasantly surprised Long Chen was that grandmaster Yun Qi had even given him a spatial ring.This was a miraculous kind of ring. As long as you sent your Spiritual Strength into the ring, you could open up an interior space connected to the ring and store any random things.As for its value, it was an extravagant commodity worth hundreds of thousands of gold coins. Before, Long Chen hadn\u2019t even dared to dream about obtaining one. Inserting his Spiritual Strength into the ring, he found that the space inside was three meters wide, causing him to be extremely grateful.Under grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s advisement, Long Chen used his identification plate to buy medicinal ingredients for half the price. He could also study the senior generation\u2019s pill refining experiences free of charge.Long Chen suddenly had a feeling like he had leaped from being a chicken to being a phoenix. Within the alchemist guild, he bought a large amount of the FengFu Pill\u2019s medicinal ingredients and some other herbs.By the time Long Chen left the alchemist guild, he felt like a completely different person than when he entered; previously, he had been worthless, but now he was worth millions. Even his back was held completely straight. In the future, he could look down his nose at others.When Long Chen finished collecting this vast harvest, he returned home. Just as he entered, he saw Bao-er at the entrance. As soon as she saw Long Chen, she straightaway brought him to Mrs. Long\u2019s room.As soon as he entered, he became dumbstruck, his heart jumping wildly in chagrin.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had willowy eyebrows over limpid clear eyes, cherry red lips popped over her pale skin, and a cascading waterfall of hair descended all the way to her waist. When she saw Long Chen enter and their gazes met, Long Chen was struck dumb.That young woman appeared like a fairy from out of this world. It was as if due to her very presence, the entire room had become a fairyland. For a moment, Long Chen was unable to do anything but stare foolishly at her.Her cheeks reddened slightly, and she turned away from him. When Mrs. Long saw this, she scolded, \"Chen-er, hurry up and greet Meng Qi. She's your future bride.\"Mrs. Long's face lit up with happiness when she said bride, but Long Chen was extremely startled since he had never even heard of such a thing.\"Greetings lady Meng Qi.\" Seeing his mother's stare, Long Chen finally recovered and bowed to her.A slight blush crept over Meng Qi's face, and she also curtsied back slightly. Although her cherry lips moved slightly, she didn't say anything back in response.Seeing all this, Mrs. Long smiled and said, \"Meng Qi, you and Long Chen are both youngsters. You two can go chat for a bit while I go prepare some food.\"Giving Long Chen an encouraging glance, Mrs. Long withdrew, leaving only the two of them in the room.Facing such a beautiful woman, for the first time, Long Chen had a feeling of having no idea what to do. After a long pause, he finally managed to choke out a single phrase. \"Please, sit.\"Meng Qi shook her head. A complicated expression flashed over her face when she glanced at Long Chen. \"I have something to say to you. Can we change locations?\"Long Chen frowned slightly, but he still nodded. The two of them left the Long estate and found a more secluded spot.Once they arrived, Meng Qi reached into her robes and slowly pulled out a seal. Long Chen almost cried out in shock when he saw it, for he recognized it to be a summoning contract that only Beast Tamers could use.A fluctuation rippled through space, interrupting Long Chen's thoughts. A huge monster over ten meters long with the head of a lion and body of an eagle appeared in front of them, a majestic aura coming off of it.Although Long Chen was unable to cultivate before, he still had managed to study up on illustrations of Magical Beasts. This beast was called the Lion Eagle, a terrifying second rank Magical Beast.The Lion Eagle in front of them had clearly not reached its complete maturity, but in terms of battle strength, ordinary Blood Condensation cultivators were not its match.This normally vicious beast was exceptionally docile in front of Meng Qi as it quietly lay on the ground.Meng Qi lightly walked up onto the Lion Eagle's back and then said to Long Chen, \"Come up.\"Long Chen glanced at Meng Qi. Seeing a hint of haste in her expression, he muttered quietly under his breath and walked on.This was the first time Long Chen had ever climbed onto the back of a Magical Beast, and he couldn't help being a bit nervous that it might accidentally go crazy and start eating people.The Lion Eagle suddenly spread its wings, and its huge body brought the two of them soaring into the sky. Long Chen was almost thrown off when it leaped into the air.Fortunately, a pale hand supported Long Chen, letting him awkwardly recover. But when he saw a faint amusement on Meng Qi's face that seemed to want to laugh, Long Chen couldn't help but feel embarrassed.\"Ahaha, I'm just a bit clumsy\u2026\" Long Chen smiled slightly and found a lame excuse.Meng Qi laughed at that, but she quickly felt embarrassed and turned around.The Lion Eagle's flying speed was very quick and in just a few minutes, they flew out of the imperial capital and descended onto Sunset Mountain.The setting sun spilled out a blood-red color that covered the entire imperial capital, an extremely beautiful scene.Both of them stood at the peak of the mountain, neither of them saying anything. As Long Chen stared at the imperial capital, a trace of helplessness flashed in his eyes.\"Long Chen, I\u2026\" Meng Qi hesitated a long while before finally sighing and opening her red lips.\"Are you here to get out of the marriage?\" Long Chen didn't turn to look at her. His gaze stayed focused on the imperial capital.Meng Qi's heart shook and a trace of disbelief appeared on her beautiful face. \"You\u2026 you already knew?\"\"I guessed.\" Long Chen slowly turned to look at her beautiful, flawless face and said, \"Thank you.\"\"You're thanking me?\" Meng Qi asked in confusion.\"Thank you for not bringing this up in front of my mother. You didn't hurt her old heart, and you also let me save my face, so I thank you.\" Long Chen smiled.Meng Qi carefully looked at Long Chen. A couple of days ago, she had already learned about Long Chen's situation in the past few years.She had thought that he would become angry when he learned why she had come, and maybe even go completely mad and wildly curse at her. But she had never thought that he would give this kind of response.\"I know you're a proud and gifted woman, for you are already able to control a second rank Magical Beast at such a young age. As for me, I'm just a normal person. We're from two different worlds, so you're not wrong to want this. There's no need for you to feel bad about it.\" Long Chen laughed lightly, and his smile was very warm and comforting.But when Meng Qi looked at this smiling expression, her heart ached in an indescribable way. This young man, practically a boy, had already suffered so much misfortune, and now she was personally leaving another scar on him and pressing the salt onto the wound. Was this not too heartless?\"Give me a couple of days and I\u2019ll convince my mother to decline this marriage. I promise you that it won't take too long.\"After saying this, Long Chen slowly turned around and walked away. The setting sun illuminated his slim figure on the middle of the mountain path, making him appear somewhat miserable.Looking at Long Chen\u2019s fading figure, tears streamed out of Meng Qi\u2019s eyes, and her hand covered his cherry lips.Was I right to do this or was I wrong?A young woman slowly walked over from behind Meng Qi and quietly consoled her, \u201cBig sis, now that everything\u2019s been said, it\u2019s already over. Although, this Long Chen really does appear pitiful.\u201dThe two women stared at Long Chen\u2019s back until he completely disappeared.Once Long Chen descended the mountain, his mood became increasingly depressed. From the first moment he saw Meng Qi, he had felt a strong feeling of love and attraction.Someone like Meng Qi was like a fairy from heaven. For a normal man like Long Chen, it would have been strange if he wasn\u2019t attracted to her.But just as this love surfaced, it was doused in icy water before it could be expressed.Long Chen\u2019s spiritual perception was exceptionally powerful, so he was exceptionally sensitive towards other people\u2019s emotions.The moment Meng Qi had shown her personal power by calling the Lion Eagle, he had already known things were not good.I\u2019ve lost love before I could even fall in love\u2026Long Chen was miserable inside, so much that he wanted to scream madly. He had suffered through so much repression and injustice, but he had never let a single cry out. However, this time, he truly did feel an urge to weep.He could sense that Meng Qi was a kind woman; otherwise, there was no need for her to do it like this, and she could have directly declined the marriage.It wasn\u2019t as if he wanted to have the marriage arrangement annulled, but what could he do? He could scream and cry at the heavens all he liked, but what was the point?Yes, maybe if he had begged her, then the marriage might have gone through, but at that point, it wouldn\u2019t even mean anything.It was better to just let it go. Although his heart ached, he could still bear it.By the time he got home, night had already descended. His mother immediately began to rain questions down on him. What did the two say, did they make any progress, were there any feelings between them\u2026Doing his best to answer and brush off the questions for a while, Long Chen finally managed to ask, \u201cMom, how did Meng Qi and I end up in an arranged marriage, and why didn\u2019t you tell me about it?Pain appeared in Mrs. Long\u2019s eyes when he asked this, but it was quickly concealed again.She told Long Chen that their two families were initially on very good terms. Their fathers were life and death friends and they decided that their children, if they were both males, would be brothers; if they were both females, they\u2019d be sisters; and if they were one male and one female, they would be husband and wife.Long Chen sighed. So your generation was all happy and carefree, but now when it comes to us, all we have is bitterness.\u201cMom, I feel that I and Meng Qi aren\u2019t suitable for each other.\u201d Long Chen thought about it for a long while, but in the end, he could only face it headfirst.\u201cWhat?\u201d Mrs. Long stared at Long Chen in disbelief.\u201cAh, mom, don\u2019t get too emotional. What I\u2019m saying is that Meng Qi and I just aren\u2019t suitable. After all\u2026\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t continue.\u201cNo, that\u2019s crazy talk! Meng Qi is such a beautiful woman; how is she unsuitable for you?\u201d Mrs. Long was angered so greatly that she couldn\u2019t help but swear.\u201cMom, listen to me. Love requires that both parties are willing. You didn\u2019t get our consent before setting this up for us. That\u2019s just too arbitrary.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 are you trying to anger me?!\u201d Mrs. Long couldn\u2019t even understand Long Chen\u2019s words anymore, and she was angered to the point that tears were falling.Long Chen was extremely embarrassed, but it wasn\u2019t as if he could say the truth. All he could do was to stand there as Mrs. Long cursed and cursed. Suddenly, his mother asked, \u201cChen-er, tell your mother the truth. Is it Meng Qi who wants to get out of this?\u201d\u201cHow could that be possible? Meng Qi is a good lady. It\u2019s just me. I feel that this is too sudden and I can\u2019t accept it,\u201d hastily replied Long Chen.\u201cNo need to say anymore. Child, it\u2019s your mom and dad\u2019s fault.\u201dMrs. Long wasn\u2019t stupid. She naturally knew what kind of character her son had. After thinking about it for just a moment, she knew that the situation wasn\u2019t as simple as he said. She hurriedly hugged Long Chen and cried bitterly.\u201cMom, it\u2019s not as bad as you think. I just think we\u2019re not suitable now. That doesn\u2019t mean we might not get along better in the future\u2026\u201d laughed Long Chen. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of my plan. First, annul this marriage arrangement, and then let your child use his own skills to pursue her back as a daughter-in-law. Wouldn\u2019t this be the best case situation?\u201d\u201cHmph, what part of that is easy? Meng Qi is a beautiful goddess. Who knows how many people are pursuing her. Without this marriage contract, when will you ever get your chance?\u201d She sighed and continued, \u201cBut you\u2019re also right. This kind of thing can\u2019t be forced. Since it\u2019s your marriage and you\u2019re now old enough, you can decide for yourself.\u201d\u201cThank you mom.\u201d Long Chen finally relaxed.Mrs. Long took out an old wooden case from under her bed, taking out a thin piece of paper from within it and handing it to Long Chen. \u201cThis is your marriage contract. If you want to get out of it, just tear it apart.\u201dReceiving that thin piece of paper, Long Chen\u2019s heart ached. An absolutely heavenly beautiful woman was about to be lost in such a way. It really was lamentable.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 A New GoalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeAtop Sunset Mountain, the sun was just beginning to rise when Meng Qi saw Long Chen walk back with the marriage contract. Despite this being what she wanted, she couldn\u2019t bear to do it. Her hand trembled, but she simply couldn\u2019t take that piece of paper.Long Chen smiled slightly. Gripping her hand lightly, he handed the marriage contract to her.When he touched her beautiful hand, his heart shook and it took a huge effort to keep himself calm.\u201cTake it. You\u2019re a kind girl, and although the situation is as it is, I don\u2019t hate you in the slightest.\u201dWith one hand in the grasp of Long Chen, Meng Qi\u2019s body shook. At first she wanted to take her hand back, but it was as if she couldn\u2019t control her own body.Long Chen\u2019s words caused her heart to ache, and the tears within her eyes spilled out. She choked out, \u201cLong Chen, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cYou really are a nice person. I should make my move now while I have a chance\u2026\u201dHis heart was plummeting, but his expression was still warm and calm. He acted in a brotherly manner, reaching out and gently wiping away her tears.It was only with his greatest strength that he managed not to become engrossed with her beautiful face. Her charm was truly just too astonishing.Without his powerful Spiritual Strength, he would have already become enchanted. But at this time, he had to continue resisting.With a faint smile, he said, \u201cMeng Qi, this isn\u2019t your fault. If you want to blame someone, you should blame our fathers. Those two old conkers played a practical joke on us.\u201dThe originally sobbing Meng Qi couldn\u2019t help but laugh when she heard his unfilial and ridiculous words.The smile that blossomed on her tear-streaked face was like a dew-covered spring flower. Her beauty was something that could not be replicated. Gazing at that face, Long Chen blurted out, \u201cMeng Qi, you really are beautiful.\u201dBut he regretted it as soon as he said it. Despite his attempts at self-control, his male wolf side still appeared. Long Chen was so angry he wanted to punch himself.Luckily, Meng Qi didn\u2019t become angry after hearing Long Chen\u2019s praise. Her face turned red, and she rolled her eyes in a cute way which was another kind of beauty.Crap, crap, Long Chen, if you miss out on such a beautiful woman, what would be the point of living?Right, I just have to do everything I can. Don\u2019t worry about danger or saving face!Long Chen sighed, and let go of Meng Qi\u2019s hand, leaving the marriage contract with her.\u201cActually, with your current status, you didn\u2019t even need to notice my existence. We\u2019re two people in two different worlds. But you still came. I know that you came because you didn\u2019t want me to harbor any false hope and have me waiting forever till the end. For you to want this is completely faultless. On the contrary, I am extremely grateful to you.\u201d\u201cLong Chen, are you just saying this to try and make me feel less guilty?\u201d With the marriage contract in her hand, her voice trembled slightly.\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying the truth. But from today onwards, I have a distant goal now,\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Meng Qi.\u201cFrom today onwards, I will put all my effort into cultivating. Once my strength is great enough, I\u2019ll come and find you. The current marriage contract has become invalid, but I\u2019ll start to chase after you again starting now.\u201dAlthough he was smiling, his eyes were filled with determination. No one could doubt his resolution.Meng Qi was speechless. This was the first time she had ever met someone who would so boldly confess to her, and even more shocking was the fact that this person was a man who she had personally delivered deep grief to.Her thoughts were in complete disorder and she didn\u2019t know how to respond. Should she decline or accept?\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel any pressure as this is just my own wishful thinking. A kind woman like you is someone worthy for me, Long Chen, to guard with my life. But before I can pursue you, I have to properly cultivate and become a true expert. Only then will I have the qualifications to protect you. In order to get those qualifications, I\u2019ll cultivate with all my might. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you accept or decline me, I\u2019ll still continue like this,\u201d said Long Chen with resolve.Meng Qi\u2019s face was completely red. Although she had previously come from a humble origin, ever since she had entered into a cultivation sect, everything had changed.This was the first time anyone had dared to confess so brazenly to her. Seeing Long Chen\u2019s determined expression, her thoughts were in a wild tumble and she was unable to say anything.There\u2019s hope, thought Long Chen in satisfaction as he looked at the bewildered Meng Qi. Right now, the most important thing was for Meng Qi to not feel any dislike with him. That would already be considered a success and a small step forward. The next steps would be to continue stirring her emotions until he moved her core.Long Chen was about to continue when a terrifying aura exploded out.Meng Qi\u2019s expression changed and she stepped forward, placing Long Chen behind her. She readied herself, prepared for anything. She waited for a moment as she assessed the situation before relaxing slightly.A huge wasp appeared in front of them. It was over fifteen meters long, and its body was covered in gaudy lines that would cause people\u2019s scalps to turn numb.Long Chen was alarmed, as that was not only a second rank Magical Beast but an exceptionally violent Bloodrage Wasp.Even a third rank Magical Beast wouldn\u2019t easily go provoke it because even they would at least be gravely injured if pierced by its stinger.But after a brief moment of fear, a certain thought arose as he looked at Meng Qi\u2019s beautiful back: You may be able to stand in front of me this time, but I will stand in front of you for a lifetime.That huge Bloodrage Wasp landed onto the ground, its terrifying cry still lingering in the air. Suddenly, a man jumped off from its back.The man appeared to be in his twenties. He was tall and very proper, giving off a noble feeling. But arrogance was written all over his face, destroying his image.As soon as the man saw Meng Qi, his eyes lit up with an unconcealed adoration.\u201cJunior apprentice-sister, master is very displeased that you haven\u2019t returned in so long, so he sent me to bring you back.\u201d At first, he was smiling brightly, but as soon as he saw Long Chen, he frowned and asked, \u201cWho is this? Could it be\u2026?\u201dColdness resurfaced in his eyes, but he once more concealed it.\u201cDon\u2019t be crazy. I\u2019m just asking this young master some questions.\u201d Meng Qi evidently wasn\u2019t good at lying and panic flashed in her eyes.Turning to Long Chen, she said, \u201cYoung master, thank you for your help.\u201dHer gaze towards Long Chen held many things, but before Long Chen could carefully see what those things were, Meng Qi had already gotten onto her steed and flown up.That man glanced at Long Chen and coldly snorted. With just a point of his finger, a transparent arrow appeared in front of him and shot towards Long Chen.Long Chen was still thinking about the look Meng Qi had given him. He hadn\u2019t expected that man to suddenly attack him, so he was completely unable to dodge in time.That arrow had been condensed from Spiritual Strength and so was completely incorporeal. If ordinary people were to be struck by it, their spirit would immediately break and they would be reduced to a simpleton.Since he was no longer able to dodge due to his surprise, he could only hastily use his Spiritual Strength to block it. Although his Spiritual Strength was great, he had never cultivated any soul arts, so he had little chance of being able to block it.Suddenly, another arrow shot out and blocked the man\u2019s attack. A powerful explosion blew Long Chen backs everal feet.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother Xi, master would be quite displeased to learn that you attacked an ordinary mortal like this.\u201dAt some unknown time, another woman had appeared beside the two of them. This senior apprentice-brother Xi\u2019s expression changed slightly, but he still laughed, \u201cJunior apprentice-sister, you misunderstand me; I\u2019m just testing him out a bit. How could I possibly really hurt him?\u201dLong Chen\u2019s expression was extremely ugly. With his Spiritual Strength, he could clearly tell that this bastard had intended to cripple him.But it wasn\u2019t just that he had attacked him. The look he had given Meng Qi had also caused Long Chen to feel a burst of anger. Adding the attack on to that and Long Chen was now fuming with anger.\u201cYoung master, this is an inner disciple of our Wind Spirit Pavilion. His cultivation is very high, so you\u2019ll have to work hard.\u201dAfter she said that, she purposely winked at Long Chen.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother Xi, let\u2019s go.\u201dAlthough she said this, she was clearly waiting for him to go with her.He glanced at Long Chen and indifferently laughed. Stepping onto the Bloodrage Wasp, the two of them departed.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but curse, \u201cThis damn crap-brother Xi, I won\u2019t forget this!\u201dAfter releasing his anger, Long Chen calmed down. No matter what, he had at least gained something from today. Although the marriage arrangement had been annulled, he had at the least given Meng Qi a good impression.The most important thing was that when Meng Qi had left, she had placed the marriage contract carefully within her robes and hadn\u2019t immediately torn it apart. That had left him with a great deal of hope.But at the same time, it gave him a great sense of urgency. How many could withstand the charm of an outstanding woman like Meng Qi? Plus, there was that crap-brother Xi beside her. His hopes could be dashed at any moment.And even if he got rid of crap-brother Xi, more crap-brothers would also come\u2026 No matter what, he had to quickly raise his cultivation base.Although he had gained the alchemist guild\u2019s emblem, the alchemist guild was a neutral power that didn\u2019t participate in any fights. He would have to rely on himself for everything.His past few miserable years had raised his wariness. He suspected that someone was possibly using his mother and him to control his father.At this point in time, his father had refused to answer the royal family\u2019s summons several times. Most likely, he already knew something was going on. The longer things stretched out, the less value the mother-son duo would have, and the greater danger they would be in.After returning home, Long Chen locked himself in his room and ordered that no one was to disturb him. He then took out the medical ingredients that he had stored in his spatial ring.Last time when he was at the alchemist guild, Yun Qi had given him a copper-gold cauldron which was a great aid to him. Cauldrons were an essential tool for alchemists, and there was a great deal of knowledge and technique involved with them.Long Chen\u2019s old cauldron was complete trash and not only did it waste a great deal of heat, but it also used up a large amount of Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame.And in terms of quality, the greatest difference was that the old one couldn\u2019t seal in the spiritual qi of heaven and earth. Spiritual qi would rush out while impurities would rush in; such a cauldron could not possibly produce any good pills.Cauldrons required a skilled artisan to forge, and as for Long Chen\u2019s old cauldron, it had been made by just an ordinary worker.But there was no way around it. A decent cauldron cost several hundred thousand gold coins, maybe even millions. There was no way for Long Chen to afford it.As for the cauldron Yun Qi had given Long Chen, it was a first tier medicinal cauldron. Only Pill Apprentices and other pill cultivators had the qualifications to use it.With this new cauldron, Long Chen was finally properly equipped.\u201cI have to pick up the pace. Otherwise, even my future wife might leave me in the future.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 FengFu Initial CondensationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeWith a muffled explosion, the pill furnace shook briefly before calming down. Nine plump medicinal pills lay quietly within.A dense, refreshing pill fragrance came from them. Long Chen smiled in satisfaction.He reached in and took out one of the medicinal pills. It was completely smooth and round with a faint luster, and there was even a layer of faint lines.\u201cAlthough the pill lines are faint and its color isn\u2019t at its peak which means that the pill has lost some spirituality, it is just barely at the middle grade pill level.\u201dThis was the first batch of middle grade medicinal pills that Long Chen had refined. The quality of a medicinal pill was dependant on the pill furnace, the Pill Flame, the Spiritual Strength, etc. Not a single one of them could be lacking.Long Chen\u2019s current Spiritual Strength was definitely good enough, but the pill furnace was too weak. And as for the Pill Flame, well that was even worse.To use an average first tier pill furnace as well as the worst kind of Pill Flame to refine a middle grade medicinal pill\u2026 Well, in the entire pill refining world, perhaps only Long Chen who had fused with a Pill God\u2019s soul could do such a thing.In just a short time, he had refined twenty batches of pills, creating over a hundred low grade FengFu Pills that were now quietly lying within his spatial ring.Long Chen had been quietly listening to what was happening outside his seclusion. Li Hao had been killed, so naturally, he wasn\u2019t a threat anymore.The imperial capital had offered a reward for the capture of whoever had killed him, but the urgency surrounding this case had faded extremely quickly.Long Chen sneered; even if they were just putting on an act, they should have at least followed through. Did they think that Long Chen was an idiot?A noble heir had been killed just like that! To simply end the affair just like that, it was crazily bold and easy to see through.Although he knew this, Long Chen didn\u2019t dare to take action now. Without a certain amount of strength, he had to wait to keep himself protected.His father was currently guarding the barbarian border and didn\u2019t know anything about what was going on here. Furthermore, according to the rules of the imperial capital, all generals that were stationed outside were not allowed to have their families leave the imperial capital. To be honest, this was just to force them to follow orders.Long Chen knew nothing about what was going on with his father at this time. All he knew was what he had inferred so far. His father would not be coming back to his side.Their noble estate used to be extremely rowdy and busy. But as he grew up and his father continued to fight on the border, less and less people would come to visit. Eventually, their estate wouldn\u2019t even have friends come over to celebrate the new year.Over the past few years, the Long household had continuously declined, its position within the imperial capital becoming lower and lower. Furthermore, Long Chen had become the target of all his fellow noble heirs.But not even the slightest news came from the Border Suppression Marquis. Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit resentful to his father, but he was always fiercely reprimanded by his mother whenever he brought that up.After his awakening a few days ago, Long Chen had finally realized that something was wrong. He had been thinking far too simply about the situation before.For his father to refuse multiple summonings, he naturally had to have his own reasons. It couldn\u2019t be just because of the battle against the barbarian tribes.If he had refused just once or twice, that would have been one thing. But he had refused to answer his summons multiple times, causing many of the nobles in the imperial capital to feel dissatisfied with Long Tianxiao.There were also people who secretly spread rumors that he was plotting a rebellion, but no matter how wildly these rumors spread, no response came from Long Tianxiao.Three years ago, the royal family ceased to issue any further summons to him, but from then on, the days of the Long household became even worse.First, the Long family\u2019s stipend was cut. No income came in any longer, immediately forcing them into poverty. Then, even the noble heirs started to bully Long Chen.Also, the last time Long Chen had been beaten, that old swindler had conned the Long family of so much money. With that, Long Chen had finally realized that something was up.Someone was slowly forcing him and his mother into desperate straits. It was obviously to force Long Tianxiao to surrender, but as for what secrets were behind this, Long Chen had no idea.But what he was sure of was that there was at least one person in the shadows who was conspiring against his father, and he was definitely extremely powerful.\u201cI can\u2019t deal with that now. A hungry wolf will eventually reveal his fangs; what I need to do now is to increase my strength.\u201dAfter giving Bao-er a few simple instructions, Long Chen immediately began his seclusion. The FengFu Star\u2019s embryonic form had already been condensed, so what was next was simple. All he needed to do was to continuously feed it with medicinal energy.The FengFu Star on the bottom of Long Chen\u2019s foot was continuously absorbing the FengFu Pills\u2019 medicinal energy and was quickly growing larger.Under Long Chen\u2019s crazy consumption of the pills, the originally small FengFu Star became several times larger over seven days. It was as if an entirely new space was forming on the bottom of Long Chen\u2019s foot.After growing to the size of a longan fruit, it no longer continued to grow. Under the continual absorption of medicinal energy, countless faint lines had started to appear over the FengFu Star. The faint lines began to slowly revolve.BOOM!When the final middle grade FengFu Pill was absorbed, that originally completely silent FengFu Star finally trembled and started to wildly absorb the outside world\u2019s spiritual energy.\u201cYes, I finally succeeded!\u201dLong Chen roared as he felt his entire body become full of energy.\u201cBut right now it\u2019s just the initial success. According to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, each star requires \u2018nine transformations\u2019 to become perfect. My FengFu Star has only just reached an initial complete form, so if I were to describe it as how the outside world cultivates, it might not even be as far as reaching the first Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.\u201dLetting out three punches into the air, the wind\u2019s roar shook his eardrums as the wall wildly shook and nearly collapsed.He was able to release such a force without using any spiritual qi and relying solely on the strength of his physical body.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but go mad with joy. Although there were drawbacks, the main one being how slow training in it was, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art\u2019s strength was absolutely amazing!At only the first Heavenstage, the current him was already so much stronger than when he had crushed the stone grinder with just a single fist.\u201cHehe, if I can continue like this, I\u2019ll definitely be able to take back my fianc\u00e9e soon,\u201d laughed Long Chen. Thinking about Meng Qi\u2019s face, a burning desire lit up within him.Next time I see that damn crap-brother Xi, I\u2019ll beat him up so badly he won\u2019t know up from down.Suddenly, Long Chen clapped his head; after focusing on his seclusion so much, he had forgotten that today was the day to go to the Imperial College!Seeing that the day was already starting to brighten, he hastily put on a new pair of clothes and rushed to the Imperial College. He had a bright smile along the entire journey.He had happily found out that his FengFu Star was able to store an extremely great deal of spiritual qi. When he refined pills in the future, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his spiritual qi being insufficient anymore.Last time he had fought with Li Hao, Long Chen had used Spirit of the Bull and had found it to be extremely powerful. He had defeated Li Hao in just one blow.But that one blow had consumed almost all of his spiritual qi. Now he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that anymore.Sensing how much spiritual qi was stored in his FengFu Star, he estimated that he had enough to use Spirit of the Bull dozens of times. This was the difference between the embryonic and initial FengFu Star!The greatest impact, however, was that with the increase of his cultivation base, his physical strength had also risen rapidly. Although he hadn\u2019t tested it, it was definitely enough to intimidate his enemies.In the midst of his self-celebration, he arrived at the Imperial College. He once more became well-behaved as he walked through its gates and hurried over to the literature hall.As soon as he entered, the originally noisy literature hall became completely silent.Li Hao\u2019s death was something many people had trouble accepting. All the noble heirs had personally gone and witnessed Long Chen\u2019s single domineering fist. The noble heirs that had originally ridiculed Long Chen now couldn\u2019t help being afraid.\u201cHaha, brother Long!\u201dFatty Yu and the others all laughed and hastily came over to him.\u201cBrother Long, you\u2019re becoming more and more handsome.\u201d\u201cBrother Long, please sit.\u201d\u201cBrother Long, have some tea.\u201d\u201cBrother Long, I\u2019ll give you a back massage.\u201dLong Chen laughed and scolded, \u201cNo need for all this nonsense. But if you can get me some food, that would be good; I still haven\u2019t eaten any breakfast.\u201dLong Chen found a corner to sit at. Fattu Yu had already brought over the refreshments, and all the rest of them were completely fixed on Long Chen.He really was hungry at the moment, as for the past few days, he had basically only consumed pills to the point that he was sick of them now. He quickly devoured the refreshments.After eating for a short while, Shi Feng also arrived and waved at him.Once he walked over, Long Chen handed him a jade bottle. \u201cTake this. In just a short time, you\u2019ll become our generation\u2019s first Blood Condensation cultivator.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t very loud, but fatty Yu and the others clearly heard it. They were shocked speechless.Shi Feng was also shocked and hastily opened the jade bottle. An extremely dense pill fragrance wafted out the instant he opened it. A single round medicinal pill could be seen inside.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dLong Chen smiled and indifferently said, \u201cCondensation Pill.\u201dOthers might not know what a Condensation Pill was, but the eighth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation Shi Feng knew. To ninth Heavenstage Qi Condensation cultivators, the Condensation Pill was an absolute treasure that they all dreamed of obtaining\u2026It had a great deal of energy that could allow someone at the peak of Qi Condensation to quickly break through to the Blood Condensation realm.Condensation Pills were extremely precious to Qi Condensation cultivators, but had no use whatsoever for the later stage cultivators.It was extremely difficult to refine. The failure rate was extremely high, especially at the most crucial pill condensation point. It was a nightmare to refine for most alchemists.An ordinary Condensation Pill would be worth more than a million gold coins, and there were basically none on the market.A million gold was something Shi Feng would never be able to obtain.\u201cLong Chen, this\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Since I\u2019ve given it to you, take it. I didn\u2019t hesitate to take what\u2019s yours, so don\u2019t get all sentimental on me now.\u201d Long Chen waved his hand.Shi Feng nodded. At this point, there was nothing more to say. Pushing down his strong emotions, he said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll consume it as soon as I reach the ninth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to wait. Can\u2019t you see the lines on top of it? You can take it as soon as you get home. You\u2019ll quickly rise to the Blood Condensation realm.\u201dOnly now did Shi Feng notice that the medicinal pill had faint lines on it. He almost shouted in surprise; this was a middle grade medicinal pill! That meant the value had multiplied several times.\u201cHurry up and take it. Amongst us brothers, there\u2019s no need to say useless things,\u201d said Long Chen.Shi Feng\u2019s eyes turned red as he took the medicinal pill. Compared to the medicinal pill, Long Chen\u2019s friendship moved him far greater.\u201cBrother Long!\u201d\u201cBrother Long!\u201dFatty Yu and the others might not know what the Condensation Pill was, but they naturally knew that medicinal pills were treasures. They were now staring at Long Chen like hungry wolves.Their urgent shouts caused goosebumps all over Long Chen, and he quickly stopped them, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already said that I\u2019ll handle your problems.\u201dThe real reason why these people were unable to cultivate was due to how deficient their Spirit Roots were. It was due to this that they were unable to sense qi.Others might have no solution, but who was Long Chen? He had the fusion of a Pill God\u2019s memories! If he couldn\u2019t handle something as simple as that, how could he possibly have been called a Pill God?\u201cEach person take a bottle. Take three drops a day. No strong foods, no alcohol, and no sex. You\u2019ll see the effect in seven days and should be able to sense qi within half a month. As for how long it\u2019ll take to enter Qi Condensation, that\u2019ll be up to how hard you work.\u201dLong Chen handed each of them a bottle of medicinal liquid that he had personally made.The medicinal liquid wasn\u2019t very valuable, and it should just barely be able to have an effect on these people\u2019s Spirit Roots. Long Chen wasn\u2019t a god; there was a limit to how great the effect would be.It wasn\u2019t a problem to let them enter Qi Condensation, and as long as they weren\u2019t unlucky, they should be able to enter the Blood Condensation realm. However, any future advancements past that were impossible.But to fatty Yu and the others, just that was something of unimaginable value. They all stared hungrily at the bottles, wanting to take a drop right now.\u201cBrother Long, if this really can let us cultivate, wouldn\u2019t that bring trouble to you?\u201d Fatty Yu might be fat, but his brain wasn\u2019t small. He was the first to realize the problem.If Long Chen really could help them who were considered trash, it might have a negative impact on Long Chen. If some unscrupulous people were to notice, then it would be troublesome.Fatty Yu\u2019s intention was to ask whether they should help Long Chen hide this matter. But Long Chen laughed, \u201cNo need to worry. These medicines were all made by grandmaster Yun Qi. If they want to, they can go find grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201d\u201cGrandmaster Yun Qi?!\u201dAll of them were shocked and were about to ask whether he was joking when steps sounded behind them.

He was wearing yellow robes and a very impressive golden crown.\u201cGreetings seventh prince.\u201dEveryone hastily kneeled down when they saw him arrive. Even Shi Feng extremely unwillingly kneeled.The youngster\u2019s name was Chu Feng. He was the seventh son of the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s current emperor, the youngest of his sons.The rumors were that by the time he was born, Emperor Chu Tiankuo had already entered seclusion. Even now, he had yet to exit that seclusion and Chu Feng had never actually met his father.Long Chen had heard quite a bit about Chu Feng. He knew that he was the son of the Western Palace\u2019s empress and was spoiled rotten. He was extremely domineering and unreasonable, and other than the crown prince, there was supposedly no one that he feared. No one could guess as to why he had come here today.But when Long Chen saw Zhou Yaoyang by his side, he immediately knew that it was another attack on him.According to imperial etiquette, all noble sons had to kneel when seeing the royal princes. Fatty Yu, Shi Feng, and all the others were all kneeling. Unless they broke through to the Blood Condensation realm, there was no way to avoid this.Long Chen frowned. Some random relative wished to force him to kneel? Other than his mother and father, another person who could force Long Chen to kneel had yet to be born.Chu Feng indifferently looked over everyone, but his expression immediately darkened when he saw Long Chen sitting there acting all grand.\u201cHow bold Long Chen. The seventh prince is here yet you actually refuse to follow etiquette and kneel. Are you trying to rebel?\u201dZhou Yaoyang and the others surrounding the seventh prince had never expected that Long Chen would be like this and actually so boldly refuse to kneel to the seventh prince.Wang Mang, who had previously already taken a blow from Long Chen, celebrated inside when he saw this. He was the first to shout out against him in order to give Long Chen a bad name.The others were all extremely startled by his actions, especially fatty Yu and them. They all started to sweat profusely.Battles between noble heirs were small things. But if you committed an offense against the seventh prince, you might very well be executed. Long Chen\u2019s actions were extremely rebellious!Zhou Yaoyang became excited. He had a slight friendship with the seventh prince. Every now and then, he would accompany the idiot prince for food or amusement.He had had a sudden thought today to bring the seventh prince to see if he might suppress Long Chen. Even since Long Chen had defeated Li Hao, his fame had soared in the imperial capital.As for Zhou Yaoyang and the others, they had received a slap in the face as they had placed practically all their money on Li Hao\u2019s victory. Their group usually spent all their time indulging in drinking and pleasure; now that they had lost all their money, those days were lost.He hadn\u2019t expected that the current situation would actually be even better than he had imagined. There was no need for he himself to instigate anything; Long Chen had already provoked the seventh prince\u2019s anger.Hearing Wang Mang\u2019s angry roar that was supposed to incite the seventh prince\u2019s anger, Long Chen smiled contemptuously. In a fake concerned voice, he asked, \u201cWang Mang, how did Li Hao taste? Seeing how healthy and plump you are, I\u2019d say that that \u2018egg\u2019 you ate suited you pretty well.\u201dWang Mang\u2019s expression immediately changed. His stomach heaved violently. What had happened then had left behind a strong aftertaste.Now, whenever he ate, he would always think of what had happened that day and involuntarily vomit everything back up.He was basically unable to eat anything due to that memory. In fact, he had already quite obviously lost weight, so Long Chen\u2019s words were obviously sarcastic and just to insult him.His face turned purple from rage, but he didn\u2019t dare to say even a single thing. He was doing his best to control his stomach, and he was afraid that if he opened his mouth, he would start vomiting.\u201cLong Chen, a small noble heir like you without an official rank or any achievements dares to not kneel when seeing this prince?\u201d The seventh prince angrily demanded.The seventh prince was normally overbearing and spoiled, and even his fellow princes and princesses didn\u2019t wish to provoke him. He naturally was unable to hold back his anger when seeing a small noble heir be so rude to him.Looking back at this youngster whose baby features had yet to recede, Long Chen indifferently said, \u201cYou\u2019re just a child so I won\u2019t bother with you. Go scram back to wherever you came from.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions changed. Was Long Chen asking for death? If he hadn\u2019t kneeled down, then the normal punishment was at most being locked up for a few days. But now that he had said such an insulting thing, it was the death penalty! Had Long Chen gone mad?!\u201cYou\u2026! You\u2019re asking for death! Arrest him for me!\u201dThe seventh prince angrily ordered the people around him.Those people were all Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s group, and they all celebrated when they heard the seventh prince\u2019s orders. Without even thinking, they all charged at Long Chen.They might have some misgivings during normal times, but with the seventh prince\u2019s order, they no longer had to worry. With such a strong supporter, even if they killed Long Chen here and now, there wouldn\u2019t be any punishment.As they charged over, Long Chen kicked forward the table in front of him. That table was made from wood over a thousand years old and was as heavy as iron. Its weight was shocking, yet it was still sent flying by Long Chen towards the charging people.Zhou Yaoyang bore the brunt of the table, roaring and using his entire strength to punch at the table.With a boom, that sturdy table was pulverized by Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s strength. He was definitely worthy of being a strong person at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation. His power would definitely shock ordinary people.But Zhou Yaoyang was still slowed down by the table, and Wang Mang zipped past him and was the first to reach Long Chen.Looking down on this idiot charging towards him angrily, a strange smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face before he punched out.His speed was practically inconceivable. No one even saw him move before they heard Long Chen\u2019s punch land on Wang Mang\u2019s face.Wang Mang was sent flying in a graceful arc through the air. But what was most shocking was that as he flew out, a dozen teeth were scattered from his mouth.His body smashed into a wall and he fainted. But his mouth was still wide open, and everyone could clearly see that he was now completely toothless.Zhou Yaoyang paused slightly when he saw Wang Mang sent flying. Although Wang Mang\u2019s cultivation base wasn\u2019t that high, for him to be handled so easily still caused him to worry.But this wasn\u2019t the time to retreat. Zhou Yaoyang roared, and the power of a seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation cultivator exploded out.\u201cSextuple Yang Fist!\u201d A fist followed along with Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s shout, his fist covered with a faint green light from his Battle Skill.The Sextuple Yang Fist was one of Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s finishing moves that he had practiced for a long time. One fist had the force of half a ton.Without any hesitation, Long Chen sent a palm to receive his fist. When the fist and palm met, energy exploded out everywhere.But what caused people to be stupefied was that Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s unstoppable fist was indifferently swatted away by Long Chen.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Zhou Yaoyang was the most startled one here. He felt as if his fist had met a huge mountain, and the pit of his stomach started to ache.As for Long Chen, he didn\u2019t blink an eye. He coldly said, \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now Zhou Yaoyang.\u201dZhou Yaoyang suddenly turned numb. He felt as if he were being stared at by a huge vicious beast. His heart jumped violently as he hastily retreated.But he was unable to do so. Long Chen grabbed his fist tightly, and no matter how he struggled, he was like a dragonfly trying to shake a tree, unable to move him in the slightest.Zhou Yaoyang was completely astonished. Just what was this power? Long Chen was a monster in human form! Without the slightest use of his cultivation base, he had completely suppressed him with just the strength of his physical body.But Zhou Yaoyang was also a strong person. He had followed his father\u2019s people to go kill a Magical Beast before. He was someone who had seen blood and wouldn\u2019t panic in the face of danger. Seeing that he was unable to escape from Long Chen\u2019s grasp, he raised his leg and kicked out at Long Chen\u2019s stomach.This was an extremely vicious attack, but Long Chen didn\u2019t even look at that kick. Using a single hand, he blocked it.With a loud roar that shook people\u2019s eardrums, Long Chen lifted Zhou Yaoyang high into the air.In front of everyone\u2019s appalled gazes, Long Chen threw Zhou Yaoyang crashing onto the ground.BANG!The entire ground shook, and at the same time, the sounds of bones cracking caused everyone to turn cold.Zhou Yaoyang vomited out three mouthfuls of blood, in addition to countless bits and pieces of some of his internal organs.Seeing him vomit out blood and the smashed ground, everyone was completely silent.Long Chen finally felt a knot of anger within him being released. That anger had been stewing for a long time.Over these years, the person he had hated the most was Zhou Yaoyang. He was like a never-ending nightmare that had tormented him all day long.The entire hall was silent for a while, including the seventh prince. All the noble heirs that had been charging towards him gulped deeply, their bodies trembling involuntarily.As for Long Chen, he had maintained a calm expression throughout the entire ordeal. But the calmer he seemed, the more frightening he was to the others. The impression he gave the others was that of a merciless death god.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but smile when he looked at Zhou Yaoyang. Turning his gaze to the seventh prince, he slowly started walking over.The seventh prince had always been spoiled. He had bullied many people, but as for being bullied, that had never happened before. Seeing Long Chen walk over with an evil smile, his face immediately turned white.\u201cWhat are you thinking? Get back!\u201d His voice was trembling with fear from the icy killing intent in Long Chen\u2019s eyes. He felt as if a knife was being held to his throat. If was as if as long as Long Chen wished it, his head would roll to the floor.Long Chen didn\u2019t say anything. He smile was still frighteningly calm as he slowly walked over.Now everyone was stunned. What did Long Chen plan on doing? Was he planning on killing the seventh prince?\u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026 don\u2019t come over\u2026\u201dThe seventh prince was continuously retreating, but now his back landed against a corner, and there was nowhere else for him to run.Seeing Long Chen come closer and closer, the seventh prince\u2019s eyes were filled with fear. He could smell the scent of death.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have forced me. Don\u2019t blame me.\u201d Long Chen pitifully shook his head. His hand slowly reached into his robes before his fist suddenly approached the seventh prince\u2019s face.\u201cNO!!!\u201d The seventh prince emitted a terrified screech that reverberated throughout the entire literature hall.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Was Long Chen really planning on rebelling? But what caused everyone to be dumbstruck was that Long Chen\u2019s hand had stopped before the seventh prince\u2019s face.The seventh prince had already shut his eyes in fear, but after waiting a while without feeling any pain, he eventually opened them.He saw that Long Chen was holding a jade tablet and was faintly smiling. Compared to the previous him who seemed like a death god, he was like a completely different person.\u201cSeventh prince, look closely. This is an alchemist\u2019s identification plate. So tell me, would I still need to kneel to you?\u201dThe seventh prince had already been frightened to death, so how could he possibly bother with checking to see if the tablet was counterfeit or not?\u201cNo\u2026 there\u2019s no need at all for that\u2026\u201d The seventh prince looked at Long Chen in fright.When he had felt Long Chen\u2019s unrestrained killing intent, he had sensed the fear of death. For a spoiled prince like him, the fact that he hadn\u2019t wet himself was already a brave point for him.\u201cMany thanks for understanding, seventh prince.\u201dLong Chen smiled. All you had to do to handle some entitled brats was to scare them a bit. Even with an alchemist tablet, there was no way someone would dare to act like this to an imperial prince. After all, this was the Phoenix Cry imperial capital.\u201cLet me help you up.\u201d Long Chen slowly reached out a hand. The seventh prince had been frightened to the point that he was now sitting on the ground.Having been frightened like this, he momentarily didn\u2019t react before nervously grabbing the extended hand.After all, he was a royal prince. If Long Chen really did cause the seventh prince to feel angry about him, then that would just be playing into Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s hands.Although Long Chen didn\u2019t care about that really, being manipulated by people certainly wasn\u2019t a good feeling. Him acting like this now was giving the seventh prince a way out.The seventh prince was only fifteen, and although he was arrogant, he hadn\u2019t experienced much. Now under Long Chen\u2019s bad cop good cop actions, he was completely at a loss. After he got up, he didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cSeventh prince, do you want to sit down with us?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cAhh, no, that\u2019s\u2026 no, I have some stuff to do, so I\u2019ll go.\u201d After saying this, the seventh prince hastily turned and left. But once he walked out of the literature hall, the seventh prince felt that his legs had turned soft.Now there was a great fear of Long Chen in his heart. That calm death god smile of his had made him sense that his life or death was entirely in Long Chen\u2019s hands.Seeing the seventh prince leave, Long Chen also turned to look back at the group of noble heirs that had previously participated in attacking him.After seeing him beat Zhou Yaoyang to such a miserable state, they were all terrified and unmoving. Seeing Long Chen turn his gaze to them, their expressions all changed and they retreated.Long Chen couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with such a group of people. Although they had previously bullied Long Chen, the current him was no longer on the same level as them. And so the bitterness and anger that he felt were also no longer as strong.He slowly walked up to Zhou Yaoyang whose breath was becoming increasingly shallow. The light in his eyes was fading as if he might die at any moment.\u201cLong Chen, you shouldn\u2019t kill him. Let\u2019s send him to the alchemist guild. They should be able to heal him,\u201d advised Shi Feng. After all, this place wasn\u2019t the martial arena. This was a private fight, and if someone died, Long Chen would be unable to escape punishment.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Look, his eyebrows are like messy grass, his forehead is practically caved in. A small person like him won\u2019t die so easily. His complexion is still rosy, see?\u201d said Long Chen.Fatty Yu and the others were speechless. Zhou Yaoyang was actually quite a handsome young man, so Long Chen\u2019s descriptions were clearly off. Those changes were caused by how heavily Long Chen had thrown him onto the ground.As for his expression still being rosy? That was due to being choked with his own blood. Yes, it was rosy, but it was actually almost purple. It was completely different from the rosy complexion of someone healthy.Reaching into his robes, he took out a medicinal pill and placed it into Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s mouth.Slap.Long Chen slapped Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s face twice, forcing the medicinal pill down his throat.Although Long Chen hated Zhou Yaoyang to the extreme, he still remembered to act properly. It was true that he had heavily injured Zhou Yaoyang, but he definitely wouldn\u2019t let him die.With his personally refined healing medicine, his internal organs would all be protected. As for his outer wounds, well those were the problem of the Zhou family. All Long Chen needed was for him to not die.\u201cYou guys, if you don\u2019t want Zhou Yaoyang to die, hurry up and bring him away,\u201d coldly said Long Chen to the noble heirs who were just standing there in shock.Only then did they recover and carefully lift Zhou Yaoyang onto a table and bring him away.They also conveniently brought along Wang Mang who was unconscious against the wall.\u201cYou, you, and you. Come and clean up the blood on the floor.\u201dLong Chen pointed to several other noble heirs. These people had often mocked Long Chen before, and although Long Chen wasn\u2019t planning on attacking them, making them do some work for him also relieved some of his anger.Those people who were pointed out by Long Chen all shivered uncontrollably. Not daring to make a single sound, they all quickly cleaned up everything diligently. In just a short time, the floor was completely clean and even Wang Mang\u2019s teeth were all found.What was outside Long Chen\u2019s expectations was that the old lecturer only came an hour after the cleaning was done.That lecturer looked at Long Chen in confusion for a moment before starting his lecture.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but curse. That old bastard was definitely paid off by Zhou Yaoyang! Otherwise, there was no way he\u2019d be so late!He had originally thought that all scholars were good people inside, but this thinking of his was shattered today. Feeling cheated, the good impression Long Chen had had of the old man was completely lost.After enduring the boring lecture and eating lunch, they all hurried to the Battle Skill Pavilion.Fatty Yu and the others didn\u2019t go; they were heading home to take the medicine instead. Seeing Long Chen\u2019s actions today had shocked them, yet at the same time, it had given them hope for their own futures, so they couldn\u2019t wait any longer.Long Chen perused several Battle Skills but felt they were all inadequate. Ordinary Battle Skills were no longer worthy of Long Chen\u2019s attention.He read through the Battle Skills very quickly, and in just two hours, nine hundred Battle Skills were all browsed through by him without a single one satisfying him.No wonder they were free to them; they were all trash Battle Skills. Some were fragmentary or overly complicated while also not being very strong. But the second floor of the Battle Skill Pavilion could only be accessed by Blood Condensation experts.Additional Battle Skills of such low level weren\u2019t of much use to Long Chen. For movement, he had the Windchasing Steps, and for battle, he had the Spirit of the Bull. Even the best Battle Skills on this floor weren\u2019t much better than them, so learning them would be of minimal use.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He was about to just give up on wasting time here when his gaze suddenly fell on the bottom corner of a bookshelf.Other bookshelves were all properly aligned so each book had its own space, but here there was a random pile of tomes.They were also Battle Skills, but some were already torn up and the others were all incomplete. In short, they were trash, but throwing them out would be too much of a waste. Thus, they had just left them in this corner.A certain page had drawn Long Chen\u2019s eye when he had looked at that corner.That animal hide page was very worn, but with Long Chen\u2019s powerful Spiritual Strength, he sensed an extremely ancient aura coming from the page.He reached out and took the page from the pile of trash. But when he did, his heart trembled. Maybe others didn\u2019t know what was so different about this animal hide\u2026But with his powerful Spiritual Strength, he could clearly sense a terrifying power coming from it!The marks on the page were already ruined and faded. It had clearly been eroded by countless years of time.Long Chen guessed that the owner of this animal hide was an extremely terrifying existence. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be such a terrifying will left behind after all these years.It was completely ridiculous that such a terrifying thing had now been thrown with the trash. Long Chen hurriedly started to study it.All that was on there was a diagram, with the words on the diagram being extremely ancient and blurry. There were three words:\u201cSplit the Heavens.\u201dWhat an absolutely domineering title for a Battle Skill! That was simply too arrogant, wasn\u2019t it?Long Chen frowned when he looked at the diagram. All he could see was that there were nine dots on it.Between the nine dots were some indistinct threads, but it was too ancient and he couldn\u2019t tell whether it was originally like that or due to the cracks from age.\u201cTime\u2019s up. All nobles heirs must put back their manuals.\u201dA cold voice rang out just at this moment. Everyone couldn\u2019t help but sigh; the time had passed too quickly. They were only allowed to come here once a month!Looking at the ruined page in his hands, Long Chen couldn\u2019t bear to part with it. His time was just too precious, and he couldn\u2019t wait another month.Seeing everyone leave, Long Chen slowly started walking with them, but he kept the ruined animal hide in his hands. The Blood Condensation expert\u2019s expression turned colder, but Long Chen spoke up before him.\u201cSenior, I want to bring this destroyed animal hide page back home to study. Also, please accept this.\u201dNot letting him refuse immediately, Long Chen first took out a medicinal pill for him. The Blood Condensation expert was just about to scold him when he realized what the medicinal pill was.Reaching out to take it, he was astonished to find that it was a Blood Condensing Pill. It was precisely the thing that a Blood Condensation cultivator like him required.And most importantly, this was a middle grade Blood Condensing Pill! It was tens of times more valuable than ordinary Blood Condensing Pills.Blood Condensation cultivators needed to borrow the spiritual qi of heaven and earth to improve their blood vessels, allowing their blood and qi to become more domineering and strengthening their physical body.As for the Blood Condensing Pill, it could increase the efficiency of condensing one\u2019s blood several times. Such a pill could save at least half a year\u2019s worth of work.The expert\u2019s expression changed in the face of it, and in the end, he was unable to resist the allure of this medicinal pill.\u201cRemember, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201dHow could Long Chen not understand what he was saying? If he was found out, he wouldn\u2019t admit to any fault and Long Chen would be accused of stealing.Long Chen simply accepted this. Only after Long Chen left with the animal hide did the expert carefully examine the Blood Condensing Pill in his hand.\u201cI really never would have imagined that he had such a treasure. I have to find out more about him.\u201d After saying this, the Blood Condensation expert disappeared deeper into the Battle Skill Pavilion.Long Chen went straight home. Since he dared to take out the Blood Condensing Pill, he was naturally unafraid of any investigation.The current him needed others to know that he was an alchemist, one close to grandmaster Yun Qi. That would hopefully prevent more troubles.Using this method, he was telling his unknown enemy that he, Long Chen, was no longer the same person. If they wanted to bring out small fries to deal with him, they\u2019d have to think about the consequences.As he walked back, Long Chen was continuously contemplating just who was behind the curtains. At some point, he ended up walking into a small alley.Suddenly, a huge net descended from the sky. Before Long Chen could even react, he was completely enveloped and whisked away.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 Enmity With a PrincessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeJust as Long Chen was wondering how he could draw out the puppet master behind the curtains, a huge net descended from above and completely trapped him before he could react.The net\u2019s design was extremely intricate. It immediately tightened up as soon as it enveloped Long Chen, firmly trapping him within.Just as Long Chen was about to struggle, he was whisked high into the air. Only now did he realize that there was a huge Hawkeagle above his head.The Hawkeagle was not a Magical Beast, but a regular wild beast. But due to how large and docile it was, it was the favorite for experts to ride on.This Hawkeagle was clearly just a mount, but it was too late for any regrets from Long Chen. He had been careless and deserved to have been ensnared.Soaring hundreds of meters into the air, Long Chen felt queasy just looking down and didn\u2019t dare to move an inch.He hoped the net was strong enough. If it broke and Long Chen ended up falling to the ground from this height, even ten lives wouldn\u2019t be enough. Falling from such a height would turn him into a flat paste.\u201cHmph, what a bold slave to dare bully my little brother!\u201dA clear, lovable voice rang out from atop the Hawkeagle. The voice was very beautiful, but the anger contained within it caused Long Chen to realize something\u2014the situation definitely wasn\u2019t good.No matter how Long Chen tried to move about in the net, he was unable to see who was atop the Hawkeagle. He was afraid to say anything because if this woman were to angrily let go, he would be screwed.Long Chen closed his mouth and didn\u2019t say anything, letting the person assume he was afraid.That woman also didn\u2019t say anything in response to Long Chen\u2019s silence. Seeing a large mountain, she urged her mount to fly over.That mountain was exactly Sunset Mountain, but the situation was completely different from when Meng Qi had brought him.Last time he was atop a mount; this time he was carried by one in a trap. And furthermore, this time the descent was extremely unsteady, a far cry from last time\u2019s slow and stable descent.The treatment this time also wasn\u2019t so good. Just when there were thirty meters left, Long Chen was dropped down.Although he had made some preparations and protected his body, to be thrown from such a height still caused him extreme dizziness.\u201cHmph, you brazen slave. If I don\u2019t give you a proper lesson today, you won\u2019t know how to respect your masters!\u201dFury blazed in Long Chen\u2019s eyes. Now that they were on the ground, if he didn\u2019t properly give her nose a twist, then she wouldn\u2019t know who was her master Long!Although he had known that she was a woman, when his eyes finally fell on her, he was completely shocked.She was a slender seventeen-year-old with large curves in all the right places. She was wearing white robes with a jade belt that caused her chest to become even more pronounced.What stunned Long Chen most of all was her willowy eyebrows, her peach-like eyes, her jasper nose, and her small mouth that had a trace of anger which gave her a different kind of beauty.\u201cHey, slave, where do you think you\u2019re looking?\u201d angrily said the woman when she saw Long Chen\u2019s eyes continuously roving around her.His originally fading anger was once more aroused when she called him a slave again. Long Chen sneered, \u201cLittle girl, have you taken the wrong drugs? Or did you eat so much you started talking crap? Why have you brought me here? Or is it that you\u2019ve become enticed by this master\u2019s looks that you can\u2019t help wanting to take the errant path?\u201dThe angry and regretful expression that he had along with his words angered the woman so much that her whole face turned red.\u201cYou shameless bastard! You dared to bully my little brother! Today, I\u2019m going to relieve my brother\u2019s anger for him. And with a face like yours, even if this lady was struck blind, I wouldn\u2019t even consider you,\u201d angrily retorted the woman.\u201cYour little brother?\u201d Long Chen was a bit confused.\u201cHmph, my little brother is the seventh prince Chu Feng! I\u2019m taking revenge on you for harassing him today!\u201dThat woman was Chu Feng\u2019s blood sister Chu Yao. She was the empire\u2019s third princess. The Phoenix Cry Empire had seven princes and three princesses, and Chu Yao and Chu Feng were the youngest of them.Chu Yao had seen Chu Feng come home completely frightened and acting very strange. When asked what the problem was, Chu Feng had been so frightened that he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone anything.Chu Yao had learned of what happened through other means. She quickly learned that the Savage Marquis\u2019s noble heir had invited Chu Feng, and from there, she quickly found out everything that had happened.As his big sister, Chu Yao refused to let the matter of Long Chen frightening Chu Feng go. But as a princess, she couldn\u2019t act too excessively in public, so she had captured Long Chen secretly on his way home.Long Chen had been busy thinking of other things and hadn\u2019t expected to be acted upon within the imperial capital. Due to his guard being down, he had been completely ensnared in someone\u2019s trap.\u201cI seem to recall that I didn\u2019t actually do anything to your little brother,\u201d frowned Long Chen.\u201cYou slave, you scared my brother witless. The penalty for this is death. Do you not even understand who is royalty and who is not?\u201d coldly asked Chu Yao.Being repeatedly called a slave, Long Chen\u2019s anger soared and he cursed, \u201cYou idiot woman, don\u2019t think that just because you\u2019re a lady I won\u2019t dare to handle you. Don\u2019t press master Long, or master Long won\u2019t hesitate.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you absolute bastard!\u201dIn all of Chu Yao\u2019s life, there had been no one who would speak to her like this. Her entire body was trembling in rage from being cursed by Long Chen.A jade palm came down to attack Long Chen. What surprised Long Chen was that Chu Yao was actually a strong person at the ninth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.That palm carried with it a blazing explosion, and what most astonishing was that it was at least a mid grade Mortal Battle Skill.Long Chen was able to sense a strangeness from that palm, and although he wasn\u2019t afraid, he preferred not to clash with her using brute force.Just when that jade palm was about to land on Long Chen, Long Chen used his quick footwork and lightly pushed on her hand, causing her palm to go wide and hit nothing.Long Chen had gently and easily dispatched Chu Yao\u2019s attack that had contained all her power. All of her force seemed to have hit a bunch of cotton and was dissipated.\u201cBastard, you dare to run!\u201d Chu Yao cutely raged and quickly turned on the ground. She was like a graceful butterfly as yet another palm shot towards him.Long Chen was once more infuriated by her insults. How could such a pretty woman say such vulgar things!But despite his stomach of anger, he couldn\u2019t be so ruthless to such pretty woman. If it had been Zhao Yaoyang, he would already have been completely trampled.He continued to dodge over and over, noticing that although Chu Yao\u2019s cultivation base was high, it was extremely superficial. Perhaps she couldn\u2019t even match someone at the fifth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.Although her attacks were powerful, they were too inflexible. She also continued to use only one move against him over and over.Whether he dodged or blocked, she only continued with that one attack. As this continued, Long Chen eventually started to smile.\u201cBastard, what are you laughing about!\u201d Having failed to strike Long Chen after so long and seeing Long Chen\u2019s stifled smiles, her anger could no longer be contained. \u201cYou bastard, you don\u2019t even know any martial arts! Come fight me head-on if you have any skills!\u201dLong Chen finally couldn\u2019t suppress his laughter anymore. His previous anger vanished into smoke. This was the first time he had ever encountered such an interesting woman.Chu Yao\u2019s face turned green, viewing Long Chen\u2019s current actions as the greatest kind of insult.\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Suddenly, she gave up her martial arts attack and came at him like an ordinary person without any training.This was greatly out of Long Chen\u2019s expectations; he had never seen such a method of fighting before. He hurriedly reached out his arms and tried to push her away.The current Chu Yao had gone crazy, and she didn\u2019t even seem to see Long Chen\u2019s hands as she continued her charge.Long Chen\u2019s large hands then ended up\u2026 tightly grabbing onto Chu Yao\u2019s chest\u2026 The soft unfamiliar feeling caused Long Chen\u2019s eyes to open wide.As for Chu Yao, when she felt a pair of large hands there, it was as if she were struck by lightning and she went completely rigid in disbelief.\u201cSorry, sorry, it was a mistake!\u201dLong Chen hastily tried to explain as he quickly took back his hands.\u201cBastard, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dChu Yao suddenly grabbed onto his arm and bit down tightly onto his shoulder. No matter what Long Chen tried, she wouldn\u2019t let go, and it was becoming increasingly painful.Angry and pressured, Long Chen didn\u2019t even think before using his hand to suddenly spank Chu Yao.The soft feeling enraptured Long Chen, but the pain from his arm quickly brought him back to his senses.\u201cLet me go or I\u2019ll continue spanking you!\u201d threatened Long Chen.A sharp pain came from his arm as Chu Yao lightly snorted. She continued to bite down tightly.Furious from the increasing pain, Long Chen raised his large hand and spanked her three more times, each with great force.She let out a pained groan and tears even started coming out. On one hand, she felt pain, but on the other, she felt wronged. But no matter what, she wouldn\u2019t let go.However, what surprised Chu Yao was that after he swatted her bottom three times, he stopped. No matter how she continued biting, he no longer moved.Quite a while passed. Maybe it was due to how her mouth was starting to hurt or maybe it was due to her being tired, but Chu Yao slowly loosened her cherry lips.Long Chen\u2019s arm and clothes were completely covered in blood now. Long Chen sighed, \u201cHave you relieved your anger?Chu Yao looked at Long Chen and saw that there wasn\u2019t any anger on his face; instead, there was a faint, sad melancholy. For some unknown reason to her, this caused her heart to tremble slightly.\u201cYou\u2026 why\u2019d you stop?\u201d For some reason, Chu Yao actually decided to ask this. She regretted it as soon as she said it and her face turned completely red.\u201cAh, I\u2019m not that good at hitting a woman.\u201d There was no anger in his voice.He tore off his sleeve, revealing that a part of his flesh had practically been bitten off. He then tried to use that torn off sleeve to bandage himself.That one sentence of his caused her face to turn even redder and her anger actually faded away.Seeing that Long Chen was completely unable to properly bandage his arm with one hand, she unexpectedly reached out her hand and took the bandage, gently saying:\u201cLet me help you bandage it.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She quietly mumbled, \u201cSorry.\u201dLong Chen was somehow different from anyone else Chu Yao had ever met. Her impression was that he was the only \u2018lower person\u2019 that dared fight back against her.She could tell from Long Chen\u2019s wild and coarse eyes that he was a man who did not fear heaven or earth. He would rather have himself in pain than to hurt Chu Yao; this had touched on Chu Yao\u2019s soft inner heart.When she carefully thought about it, perhaps Long Chen really hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, or maybe she just didn\u2019t know the whole story. This was the first time in all her years that she started to feel a trace of guilt.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Long Chen was just about to say something.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. We\u2026 today we\u2019ll call it even. I bit you, and you\u2026\u201d Her face turned red. Her chest still felt different from before as she hadn\u2019t forgotten that previous feeling.\u201cNo, I want to say\u201d Long Chen shook his head.\u201cEverything that needs to be said has been said. This is over. What more do you want to say?\u201d Chu Yao said a bit angrily.\u201cOh pretty woman, what I want to say is that you bit my left arm. Why are you bandaging my right arm?\u201dOnly now did Chu Yao notice that in her carelessness she had bound the wrong arm. Not only did her face turn completely red, but seeing his helpless expression, she softly cursed, \u201cScoundrel, why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201dShe unbound and bound Long Chen\u2019s other arm. It was just a flesh wound, so other than hurting a bit, it couldn\u2019t be considered serious.Long Chen was laughing inside. This beautiful woman at least had a bit of a conscience. His strategy of hurting himself to gain her trust had worked perfectly.Actually, he had healing medicines within his spatial ring, both for outer and inner wounds. But he didn\u2019t take them out in order to put on a proper show.Originally, Long Chen hadn\u2019t been expecting his plan to work this well. If his soft approach hadn\u2019t worked, he had been completely prepared to deal out harsher reprisals. Fortunately, she had fallen hook, line, and sinker for his trap. This had greatly surpassed his original expectations.It was also the first time that he gained a faint favorable impression of the royal family. He gently said, \u201cYour little brother was being used. Zhou Yaoyang wanted to use him to pressure me.\u201dHe then recounted what had happened between him and Zhou Yaoyang briefly. This time he didn\u2019t need to arouse her emotions; all he did was indifferently explain a bit of what he had been through.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Long Chen. It was I who wronged you.\u201d Chu Yao felt guilty now, feeling as if she had gone too far.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m already used to this,\u201d indifferently said Long Chen.Although his speech was very flat, combined with his sullen expression, it gave people a powerful moving visual.Long Chen\u2019s expression caused Chu Yao to feel even more guilt. It was as if she had rubbed salt into someone who was already covered in wounds.\u201cHaha, don\u2019t take it so seriously. I\u2019m just tricking you into sympathy,\u201d smiled Long Chen.She didn\u2019t know why, but seeing Long Chen\u2019s smile caused her to feel even worse for him. Even tears started to stream down her face.\u201cCrap, don\u2019t cry. I\u2019ll stop talking about it.\u201dLong Chen might not fear heaven or earth, but he was afraid of the tears of a woman. He immediately became flustered and didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d broken-heartedly asked Chu Yao. She felt as if she was the worst person in the world.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, this wasn\u2019t your fault. It was all caused by a different bad person so don\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d consoled Long Chen.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cNo buts. Leave the past in the past. Keep the happy days and forget the sad days. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve done it as long as I can remember,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cThank you, Long Chen.\u201d Chu Yao dabbed her tears, and a smile appeared on her beautiful face.Long Chen\u2019s heart trembled a bit when he looked at Chu Yao. Although she might be just a smidge inferior to Meng Qi, her beauty was enough to topple cities. Especially when she laughed; no males could remain unmoved.Seeing Long Chen suddenly foolishly stare at her, Chu Yao asked in confusion, \u201cLong Chen, why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s because you\u2019re too beautiful. Please don\u2019t take any offense.\u201d Long Chen\u2019s face reddened as he replied truthfully.\u201cAm I really beautiful?\u201d Chu Yao seriously asked as she pushed her fine hair behind her ear.Long Chen was surprised, asking, \u201cOf course, you\u2019re beautiful; could it be that you didn\u2019t know? Has no one else ever told you?\u201dChu Yao shook her head, saying, \u201cPeople tell me that every day, but I don\u2019t trust them. I don\u2019t like those people who are fake to me every day.\u201dShe appeared helpless as she said this. It was a pitiful sight that caused Long Chen\u2019s heart to hurt for her. Compared to the girl who had attacked him, it was like two different people. Long Chen hadn\u2019t expected Chu Yao to have such a side to her.\u201cLet\u2019s find a place to sit. Standing like this is awkward.\u201dLong Chen found a clean boulder to sit on, and Chu Yao nodded. But as soon as she sat down, she suddenly jumped back up with a cry.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dChu Yao\u2019s face was completely red. She angrily replied, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of you!\u201dLong Chen quickly realized what it was and felt guilty. But behind his back, he rubbed his right hand a couple of times, reliving that wonderful feeling from before.Chu Yao took out a long blanket from her spatial ring and covered the boulder before gently sitting. But she still knit her brow slightly when she touched the surface as it was still slightly painful.\u201cAbout that\u2026 uh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Long Chen apologized in embarrassment. Those actions of his didn\u2019t exactly fit with the image of a noble gentleman, but at that time, Long Chen hadn\u2019t been expecting to have to act like one.Plus, he had been very pressed when being bitten. His unadulterated actions weren\u2019t really to take advantage of her.\u201cI\u2019ve never met someone as terrible as you. This is the first time anyone\u2019s ever hit me.\u201d Chu Yao\u2019s eyes reddened with grievance.\u201cHey, don\u2019t cry. How about I let you hit me on the bottom too?\u201d hastily joked Long Chen when he saw that she was about to cry.\u201cHa, who would want to hit you there? You\u2019re such a bad person!\u201d Chu Yao immediately laughed at that, a complete reversal in emotions.He relaxed slightly now that she wasn\u2019t about to cry. Hitting a princess really had been audacious, even for him.\u201cLong Chen, although you\u2019re a bad person, I feel like you\u2019re not a cheater who will lie to me just to curry favor. Can we be friends?\u201d seriously asked Chu Yao.\u201cOf course. As long as you don\u2019t put me into a net again next time. Truthfully, I was really afraid that you were going to let go and let me fall,\u201d laughed Long Chen.Chu Yao also laughed, remembering how sorry a figure he had looked like when she had dropped him previously.After laughing together, the distance between the two of them had become much lesser. Chu Yao actually began to talk about things that she and her little brother had gone through.Perhaps it was due to this being the first time she could say whatever she wanted, but she actually told Long Chen many things.\u201cChu Yao, how long has it been since you\u2019ve seen His Majesty?\u201dShe shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since I was three years old. My little brother has never seen him even once.\u201dLong Chen nodded. He hesitated a bit, but in the end, still decided not to ask her certain questions. His friendship with Chu Yao had only just started, so he couldn\u2019t suddenly ask sensitive questions.But he really did want to know what the situation was with the imperial palace. Who was actually targeting the Long family?The emperor had been in seclusion for five years before summons came out for Long Tianxiao to come back. But it was at that time that Long Tianxiao had started to refuse the imperial commands.Just what had happened during that period? Moreover, his father hadn\u2019t sent any messages back in over ten years. Why? Had he really abandoned his wife and son?Although his memories of him were somewhat vague now, Long Tianxiao\u2019s steadfast image was deeply imprinted in Long Chen\u2019s heart. He definitely wasn\u2019t such a person.But then what was going on? Long Chen was stuck in a huge puzzle, but he also couldn\u2019t rush solving it.Because the closer he came to the truth, the more dangerous it would become. Before he had the proper strength, Long Chen needed to continue lying low.Long Chen continued asking a few roundabout questions. What was going on with the other princes, etc. Chu Yao didn\u2019t seem to guess Long Chen\u2019s intentions and thought Long Chen was just interested in her, so she continued to answer.He was a bit ashamed to trick such a woman, so he stopped asking in order to avoid piling on the guilt.Since he was getting closer and closer to the truth, the most important thing was for him to quickly raise his strength. Now that his FengFu Star\u2019s initial condensation was complete and his spiritual energy had increased, he could increase the rate at which he refined pills and continue nourishing the FengFu Star.Once the FengFu Star reached its perfect state, he could attack Blood Condensation. Only after reaching the Blood Condensation realm would a person become a true martial artist. Right now, he was just too weak.The other thing that pleasantly surprised him was that as the FengFu Star grew larger, his physical body also changed with it and became stronger.The FengFu Star was just like a spring nourishing his whole body. His current transformation made him greatly different from his old self.His greatest support was the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but this technique was too mysterious. All that was in his memories was how to cultivate it; there was nothing else about it.Chu Yao continued to chatter for four full hours before starting to feel embarrassed and starting to ask questions of Long Chen.Long Chen laughed and talked about a couple of interesting things. He didn\u2019t say anything about his bitter suffering. Apparently, Long Chen had an exceptionally talented eloquence and mouth. Bright laughter occasionally rang out from Chu Yao.That rough and willful princess had now changed to become a yearning lady.The two of them only realized how much time had passed when the sun started to set. Chu Yao asked, \u201cLong Chen, can I come to find you in the future to hang out?\u201dLong Chen hesitated slightly since he was afraid of being too close to anyone from the imperial family, but seeing Chu Yao\u2019s eyes filled with hope, he couldn\u2019t help agreeing, \u201cOf course. But it\u2019ll have to be a secret between us.\u201dHer face reddened and her beautiful eyes looked away. She hurriedly whispered, \u201cThen I have to go.\u201d\u201cYou go back first. I\u2019ll walk home.\u201d If the princess was being noticed to have a male companion on her mount, it would definitely bring great trouble.Chu Yao seemed to also understand and whispered a goodbye to Long Chen before flying away on her Hawkeagle.Seeing her figure gradually fade away, an uncomfortable feeling arose in his heart. Only after a long time later did he sigh and start walking back.But just as he arrived at his family gate, he saw countless elite troops had already completely encircled the Long estate. His face darkened and killing intent immediately surfaced.Since you\u2019ve come seeking death, I won\u2019t hold back.The fury in his heart could no longer be suppressed, as he directly charged at the elite troops which were surrounding his home.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 The Savage MarquisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeHundreds of troops had surrounded the Long estate, forming a tight encirclement. An armored middle-aged man on top of a horse was arrogantly looking down on Mrs. Long.Mrs. Long was pale as she spoke to that man, while Bao-er and the other members of the household were all terrified as they cowered from the troops.When Long Chen appeared, that man\u2019s eyes brightened and he coldly shouted, \u201cLong Chen, you needlessly injured the noble heir Zhou Yaoyang extremely heavily. We\u2019ve received orders to capture you. Will you go willingly?\u201dThese troops were all elites that had heavy bloody auras. How could Mrs. Long have ever seen such a display of killing intent? She was as pale as a sheet of paper as she tottered, about to collapse. She would have really collapsed if Bao-er didn\u2019t go to support her.Long Chen completely ignored all the troops as he walked to his mother. His heart hurt to see how afraid she was.\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. This is just a dream. Once you are awake, all of this will be gone,\u201d said Long Chen gently as he took her hand.A gentle Spiritual Strength came out with his words. Mrs. Long\u2019s eyelids felt heavy, and she fell into a deep slumber.\u201cBao-er, Zhang Ma, can you help me bring my mother in?\u201dLong Chen couldn\u2019t bear to see his mother so frightened, so he had used his Spiritual Strength to directly force her to sleep. Otherwise, as a normal mortal, it would be easy for her to fall ill from experiencing such a fright.Bao-er and Zhang Ma carried Mrs. Long back inside, while Long Chen told everyone else to close the doors.Looking at the person seated on the horse and sensing the faint Blood Qi from him, a ridiculing smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face. \u201cSo it\u2019s just half-step Blood Condensation.\u201dSeeing Long Chen act high and mighty without the slightest intention of leaving quietly, the man rolled his eyes.\u201cLong Chen, you\u2019ve committed a grave crime, a crime so severe that no one can protect you. Are you waiting for me to personally capture you?\u201d he coldly shouted.\u201cHuh? You\u2019re just a sergeant. A dog like you wants to personally capture me? Don\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d ridiculed Long Chen.Sergeant was the lowest commanding rank within the Phoenix Cry Empire. Someone like that had no past accomplishments or true power; it was just a small team-leader role.But this particular fellow had become so excited about reaching that rank that he couldn\u2019t shut up about it. As soon as he had risen to sergeant, he had become accustomed to his role.Long Chen\u2019s words now were like poisonous arrows that shot into his heart. His face immediately became unsightly.He came from a low origin and had suffered for over ten years in the army camp before an opportunity finally came for him to break through to the Blood Condensation realm, and only after that was he promoted to sergeant.His current greatest achievement was now being viciously insulted, causing his killing intent to soar.\u201cLong Chen, don\u2019t force me to kill you.\u201d The man ground his teeth and his hand went to the sword on his belt.\u201cIf you dare to draw your blade, I will let your head fall to the ground.\u201dLong Chen clasped his hands behind his back. His tone was extremely serious. It wasn\u2019t loud and lacked the slightest anger, sounding just like a strong expert with endless confidence.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for death!\u201d The man roared and shot forward off the horse, sending his fist punching at Long Chen.Blood Qi circulated throughout his body, and a red glow appeared on his body, clearly showing that he had used a trace of the Blood Condensation realm\u2019s power.Long Chen\u2019s gaze was electric, and his face cold. He took a step forward while also unleashing a fist.BOOM!Gale winds surged when the two fists met. Both parties were sent several steps back from the explosion.\u201cYou\u2019re actually so insolent with just this little ability?\u201d Long Chen coldly mocked.The man\u2019s expression changed. To be ridiculed by someone called a cripple caused him enough fury to explode.\u201cGo die!\u201dHe unsheathed his sword and sent it slashing at Long Chen\u2019s neck. A whistling wind pierced people\u2019s ears, causing them to feel a chilliness inside.As if waiting for this exact moment, Long Chen\u2019s foot tapped the ground and retreated several feet in a ghostly manner, completely avoiding the attack.This retreat had used the newly learned Windchasing Steps. Although he was still at the initial training level of it, with Long Chen\u2019s fused Pill God memories came an incomparable understanding of the human body\u2019s meridians. With such an understanding, it was as if he had already been practicing it for tens of years.With a single step, he arrived in front of a soldier and reached out. That soldier was extremely surprised and hastily raised his blade to block.But unexpectedly, his hand shook and the blade disappeared. The next moment he could see Long Chen, he was viciously slashing his sword at the sergeant.The sergeant was still off-balance from his swing and had still yet to ready himself. Long Chen\u2019s retreat, seizing of a blade, and attack had all happened in just a breath. The whistle of the blade slashing towards him shocked him and he quickly used all of his strength to block it.BOOM!After the explosion, the sergeant felt some kind of energy he couldn\u2019t contend with, and he was knocked back several metersAs soon as he managed to stabilize his body, his stomach dropped. With his years of experience of life and death battles, he unconsciously raised his blade.With another huge explosion, sparks flew everywhere as a cold light flew dozens of meters away into a tree.Previously, that sergeant had used his surprising intuition to block one of Long Chen\u2019s slashes. But he had been unable to resist Long Chen\u2019s terrifying strength. The web between his thumb and forefinger split and his sword was sent flying.Now the sergeant no longer had his previous arrogance. He was completely stunned and despaired as a cold light flashed in front of his eyes, appearing like the scythe of the Grim Reaper.\u201cNO!\u201dThat terrified scream hung in the air as the sergeant\u2019s head flew through the air, his face twisted in an expression of shock and unwillingness.Just as his consciousness was fading, he suddenly remembered what Long Chen had said before. If you dare to draw your blade, I will let your head fall to the ground\u2026He now finally believed that Long Chen hadn\u2019t been trying to intimidate him, but had just spoken the truth. Unfortunately, his realization came too late.His headless corpse collapsed to the ground. The head tumbled through the air a long time before finally falling to the ground and rolling further away.As for all the soldiers, they were all dumbstruck. The weapons in their hands felt much heavier at this moment.They were all people who had seen blood before, but never such a ruthless scene as today. Long Chen had had a completely expressionless face from start to finish, completing the kill without even batting an eye. It was even more frightening than if he had been seething with anger.\u201cLong Chen, you dare to kill my trusted lieutenant. Do you believe me when I say I\u2019ll destroy the entire Long estate?\u201dAn angry cry suddenly came from afar, as a dignified middle-aged man walked over with dozens of experts.\u201cHave you finally come out?\u201d Long Chen coldly laughed inside. As soon as he had arrived, he had used his divine sense to scout the surroundings and noticed those people hiding and watching from a distance.\u201cSavage Marquis, you really are worthy of your name. An unreasonable assault like this is just what I\u2019d expect from someone of your reputation,\u201d said Long Chen lazily as he leaned against a stone lion in front of his house gate.\u201cToday at the literature hall you committed a crime against the seventh prince, heavily injured my son, and now you\u2019ve killed my trusted lieutenant. Hmph, no matter how you try to spin it, I\u2019d like to see how you\u2019d get out of this one. Let\u2019s see who will come to save you now!\u201d shouted the Savage Marquis angrily.Looking at this person who was as famous as his father, a ridiculing smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. Someone with such weak methods was also as famous as his father? What crap!\u201cZhou Weiqing, did you get stupider the older you lived? Do you really think that I, Long Chen, am someone who needs rescuing? You really are an idiot.\u201dTaking out the jade tablet from his robes, he said to him, \u201cOpen your dog eyes. Can you see what this is?\u201dWhen Zhou Weiqing who was also known as the Savage Marquis saw the pill furnace diagram carved into the jade tablet, his expression changed to one of complete shock.\u201cHow is that possible?! How can you have the tablet of a Pill Apprentice? Is it a fake?\u201d demanded Zhou Weiqing angrily.\u201cIdiot, you really have gotten senile. Fine, for someone as stupid as you, I\u2019ll give you an extra close look.\u201d Long Chen directly threw the jade tablet to Zhou WeiqingWhen he carefully examined it, his expression grew even more shocked. As a powerful nobleman, how could he possibly not be able to tell the veracity of the alchemist guild\u2019s status tablets?And it was precisely because he recognized it that his expression was so shocked. The person who had signed this tablet was actually Yun Qi! Everyone in the Phoenix Cry Empire with a brain knew of that grandmaster\u2019s name!Even the successive generations of the royal family had to be respectful to alchemists. The alchemist guild held an extremely high level of influence in the empire.\u201cDo you see now Zhou Weiqing? Can you hand my tablet back to me?\u201d laughed Long Chen coldly as he looked at the dazed Zhou Weiqing.The Savage Marquis\u2019s expression was extremely ugly. He wanted to crush the jade tablet in his hands and capture Long Chen, but he didn\u2019t dare do so.He didn\u2019t know how Long Chen had obtained this tablet, but having it meant Long Chen was one of the alchemist guild\u2019s people. Those were people above the empire\u2019s laws, and he didn\u2019t have the power to butt in.Zhou Weiqing was at a complete loss. He returned the tablet to Long Chen, but at that moment, Long Chen\u2019s expression suddenly changed and he coldly shouted, \u201cZhou Weiqing, today you surrounded a Pill Apprentice\u2019s home with blades, a vicious crime. If you don\u2019t give me some recompense, I will go to the alchemist guild tomorrow and fill out an application for the Phoenix Cry Empire to punish you.\u201dZhou Weiqing\u2019s expression immediately changed. The alchemist guild\u2019s punishments were definitely something to be afraid of. They would cut off the empire from medicinal pills, which was the same as choking the lifeline of the empire.\u201cIt seems that I don\u2019t have a clear understanding of what went on today. I\u2019ll immediately go back and investigate to give you proper compensation.\u201d With Long Chen\u2019s current status, Zhou Weiqing could only swallow his anger.This was the first time Long Chen had ever admired this Savage Marquis. His ability to swallow his own crap was quite amazing.No wonder despite the passing of over ten years, he still remained in the Blood Condensation realm. He must have spent all of his time training how to swallow crap.\u201cNo matter how or what you investigate, before I am awake tomorrow, my estate had better be completely cleaned up. Otherwise\u2026 well, you know what will happen.\u201dLong Chen coldly snorted and no longer bothered with this treacherous fox. He directly went inside his estate and slammed the doors shut.He was extremely irritated from today\u2019s affairs. In the morning at the literature hall, in the afternoon at Sunset Mountain, and in the evening at his estate gate\u2026 fighting three times in one day was definitely enough to irritate someone. But at least what had happened during the afternoon had been a bit more alluring.After Long Chen left, the Savage Marquis\u2019s expression became ashen. He hadn\u2019t achieved the slightest bit of his goal in coming here but instead incited great trouble for himself.\u201cMaster, what should we do?\u201d\u201cWhat should we do? Hurry and start cleaning up this crap. Even if you have to lick off the bloodstains on the ground to get them off, hurry up and do it.\u201dWith a stomach full of anger and nowhere to release it, the Savage Marquis took it out on his soldiers, cursing and raging. In the end, he left alone.\u201cCrap, how did that little brat get into the alchemist guild? Now it\u2019ll be troublesome.\u201dThe Savage Marquis muttered inside darkly. Seeing no one around him, he started walking towards the imperial palace.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 Facial Rejuvenation ElixirPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeIn a small side room of the imperial palace, a handsome man in his twenties was quietly listening to the Savage Marquis\u2019s report.\u201cThis happened too suddenly and was completely out of my expectations, so your servant didn\u2019t dare to act on his own. I beg for fourth prince\u2019s forgiveness and guidance,\u201d said the Savage Marquis.That handsome man was the fourth prince Chu Xia. But what separated him from his other princes was that he was just the son of an imperial concubine.Although he was also a prince, his status was much inferior to the others. But due to his low-profile nature, he didn\u2019t incite the others\u2019 jealousy, and so he had a very good relationship with all the princes.Practically all the aristocracy in the empire felt that the fourth prince had the best aptitude for inheriting the throne, but unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t born to the right mother.The fourth prince Chu Xia nodded and said, \u201cYou were right not to act. The fact that Long Chen managed to become an alchemist out of nowhere is definitely a bit surprising.\u201d\u201cYes, when I saw his tablet, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. For that trash to become an alchemist is just too outrageous.\u201d The Savage Marquis was also shaking his head and even now he was somewhat in disbelief.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting. After this Long Chen was heavily injured by your son, he seems to have completely changed and is now so much stronger that he is able to kill a half-step Blood Condensation expert. There might be more than what meets the eye here,\u201d the fourth prince paced around for a bit before saying, \u201cGo back and carefully observe the Long estate\u2019s movements. See if anyone suspicious goes in. Remember, don\u2019t get caught.\u201d\u201cThis servant will handle it. But as for Long Chen\u2026\u201d The Savage Marquis hesitated slightly.\u201cDon\u2019t bother him for a while. He\u2019s just a chess piece. As long as he doesn\u2019t jump off the chessboard, even with a patron, he won\u2019t be able to escape his fate. His current status is something we must be sensitive about. Get your son to temporarily back off. That\u2019s right, how are your son\u2019s injuries?\u201d asked the fourth prince.\u201cThank you for your concern fourth prince. After his recuperation, he\u2019s already out of the woods,\u201d hurriedly replied the Savage Marquis.But speaking of which, when Zhou Yaoyang had been carried back, the Savage Marquis truly had been frightened greatly. Those injuries had been so severe that he hadn\u2019t even recognized his own son.But what fortunate was although the injuries appeared frightening, the inner injuries weren\u2019t very great. That was because Long Chen had made him consume a medicinal pill to preserve his life.In just a short time of recuperation and after spending a great deal of gold, Zhou Yaoyang was already able to get up and walk. Other than being temporarily unable to fight with others, he already didn\u2019t have any great deficits.\u201cHm, that\u2019s good then. Go back and remember what I said. Watch them closely, and as soon as anything strange happens, immediately report it to me.\u201d\u201cYes, your servant is excused.\u201dAfter the Savage Marquis left, the fourth prince went to the window. Staring out into the pitch darkness, a smile appeared on his lips.\u201cThe black curtain of the night cannot last forever; the sunlight will quickly arrive. Long Tianxiao, just how long can you resist?\u201d\u2026The next day\u2019s morning, when the people of the Long household opened the great gates, they found that the floor had been completely retiled, flabbergasting the estate\u2019s people.What they didn\u2019t know was that the Savage Marquis\u2019s people had completely dug out all the tiles that had been stained with blood.Seeing the uneven ground after the tiles were excavated, that person who had been cursed by him considered it and ordered the people under him to completely re-tile the floor before he felt reassured.Long Chen smiled mockingly when he saw this. Those childish men would bully the weak and only fear the strong. Now they would be more well-behaved!The first thing Long Chen did after getting out of bed was to go see his mother. When she awoke, it was as if everything that had happened yesterday had been just a dream.\u201cChen-er, what happened yesterday?\u201d Although she saw that Long Chen was completely safe, she was still a bit nervous.\u201cMom, your son has already grown up and become a true man. Just the same as my father, I can also shield this family from wind and rain,\u201d said Long Chen solemnly as he held his mother\u2019s hand.He didn\u2019t want her to know too much; she was just an ordinary mortal after all. Before this, Long Chen had already examined her body. The meridians she had been given by the heavens were simply too short, and it wasn\u2019t just that she had a bad Spirit Root, but that she didn\u2019t even have one at all.Furthermore, his mother was now almost forty and had no way to cultivate the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Besides, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was a Yang cultivation method; women were unable to train in it.No matter how Long Chen tried to defy the heavens, he had no way to change his mother\u2019s natural constitution. All he could do for her was to let her not worry.Seeing her son seem to just grow up overnight, it was as if she were seeing the image of her strong husband. Mrs. Long couldn\u2019t help being moved and tears started to flow down.\u201cGood child, mom won\u2019t ask you anymore. Mom trusts you.\u201dLong Chen quickly wiped away his mom\u2019s tears, laughing, \u201cMom, your son has grown up. You should be happy! I prepared a gift for you.\u201dHe then touched his spatial ring, causing a jade bottle to appear in his hand. Before he could say anything, Mrs. Long asked in surprise, \u201cWhere did you get a spatial ring?\u201dLong Chen didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Why did his mother\u2019s expression seem so suspicious?Of course, he knew that always hiding things from his mother wasn\u2019t a solution. In order to handle his mother\u2019s worries, he told her about his status as an alchemist.In any case, people would learn about it sooner or later, so he had no need to hide it. Long Chen also took advantage of this to say that after he had been beaten, luck had shined on him and he had opened his meridians; meaning he could cultivate now.And he had even managed to cultivate a Pill Flame and obtain the qualifications to become an alchemist. When he had gone to the alchemist guild, he had by chance met grandmaster Yun Qi. He had immediately leaped at that chance, using his pity to get closer to him.Long Chen used his tears to move grandmaster Yun Qi, who finally ceded and made an exception to let him become an alchemist.Hearing these shocking words, Mrs. Long was completely mystified. But Long Chen solemnly swore it was the truth and also took out his tablet for his mother to examine. Only then did she believe it.Although she wasn\u2019t a cultivator, she knew about alchemists. That was a supremely grand occupation; for Long Chen to become one was worth several generations\u2019 of luck.\u201cMom, don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll help you apply this.\u201dFrom the bottle, he took out a couple drops of medicinal liquid. He gently dabbed it onto his hand, causing a fresh scent to fill the room. Just one breath of it could completely relax a person.Seeing how serious Long Chen was now acting, Mrs. Long didn\u2019t move at all. Long Chen gently applied the medicinal liquid on her face.A cool and relaxing feeling immediately spread across her face.\u201cChen-er, just what is this? It feels very good,\u201d whispered Mrs. Long. She closed her eyes and relished the feeling.\u201cHehe, this is a special treasure your son got for you. Just stay still,\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cNaughty child.\u201d Hearing him laugh and refuse to answer, Mrs. Long smiled. Her heart grew warmer.She had raised Long Chen since he was a baby, changing diaper after diaper. Now that he had grown up, he finally understood what filial duty was, so Mrs. Long\u2019s heart rejoiced.\u201cOkay, you can open your eyes.\u201dMrs. Long slowly opened her eyes and found that her dressing mirror was being held in front of her eyes by Long Chen.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dLooking at her own reflection, she couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in shock. Turning her head left and right, she found that it definitely was her, but she now appeared much younger.The wrinkles near her eyes had faded greatly; her original skin that had been starting to turn dry had become extremely sleek, and she now appeared at least a decade younger.\u201cChen-er, am I dreaming?\u201d Mrs. Long couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.\u201cI dunno whether you\u2019re dreaming or not, but if you keep looking at yourself like that, it\u2019ll be lunch in no time at all,\u201d laughed Long Chen.Mrs. Long turned red and lightly tapped Long Chen. \u201cBad child, you dare to tease your mom? It\u2019s not that late!\u201dLong Chen smiled. Not only did her face appear younger, her heart had also become much lighter. \u201cMom, I refined this Facial Rejuvenation Elixir just for you. Although the medicinal ingredients are just average, it\u2019s not a problem for it to make you look like how you did when you were thirty.\u201dThe Facial Rejuvenation Elixir normally required a Facial Rejuvenation Fruit as the main medicinal ingredient, but those were too rare and Long Chen was unable to obtain one in a short time.He had used a kind of Facial Rejuvenation Herb as a substitute. The effect was much worse than the Fruit, and so it couldn\u2019t return people back to their youthful days, but to reverse a few years of aging was no problem.\u201cReally?\u201d Mrs. Long was delighted; which woman didn\u2019t cherish her looks?With her husband essentially in another land from her and with Long Chen having an innate handicapped physique, her heart had been extremely strained and that had caused her to age quickly.Seeing his mother so worn, guilt washed over Long Chen. His mother had truly paid far too much for this family.\u201cMom, I\u2019ll leave this bottle with you. I\u2019ll also give you some medicinal pills for you to use. I guarantee that in less than a year, no one who didn\u2019t know us would believe that you are old enough to be my mother. They\u2019d think you were my sister, haha,\u201d laughed Long Chen as he clasped his mother\u2019s hands.\u201cThis flippant child. Don\u2019t forget what we agreed on. Meng Qi is a wife you cannot let get away. I don\u2019t care what method you have to use, you must bring her back.\u201d Although she was happy now, this matter continued to always weigh on her mind.Back when Long Chen had brought up about leaving Meng Qi, she had already roughly guessed what had happened. A woman as beautiful as Meng Qi was someone no man would give up.She couldn\u2019t help having her heart hurt when she thought of what Long Chen had done with the marriage agreement. To be frank, it was precisely because of her own powerlessness that her son had to suffer through that.In truth, Mrs. Long had been starting to feel more and more upset inside, but Long Chen had never brought it up again. When he now displayed his capabilities to her, she immediately thought of that matter.Before, Long Chen was unable to match up to her; but now that he was an alchemist, his status had leaped up. She couldn\u2019t help but to bring it up. There should be a chance now.\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. Do you really not know my character? Who would dare to snatch something from me? Back when we were young, didn\u2019t I end up biting my cousin so hard when he stole my toys that he started to cry and shout?\u201d laughed Long Chen.Although Long Chen laughed for a moment, his laughter faded quickly. He saw the distress within his mother\u2019s eyes.Ever since his father had been stationed at the border, he seemed to recall that his mother had never once visited the family on her side. Her own family was already in a miserable situation, so his mother had never tried to go there to beg for help.Long Chen held her hand and said, \u201cMom, your son is now an alchemist. Our hard days are over, so don\u2019t think about such sad things.\u201dAfter accompanying his mother for some more time and seeing her mood gradually relax, Long Chen went to the alchemist guild.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 Line of CreditPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeAs soon as he arrived at the alchemist guild, Long Chen tried to go to Yun Qi\u2019s refining room. But he was stopped as soon as he entered the inner division.The alchemist guild was divided into inner and outer divisions; the outer division was open to the empire. The examinations to become an alchemist were all held in the outer division.However, the inner division was the true alchemist guild. Last time, Long Chen had only managed to enter the inner division for his test because grandmaster Yun Qi had been leading the way, so naturally, he hadn\u2019t been blocked back then.\u201cUnqualified people cannot enter the inner division.\u201dThe guard in front of the door was a youngster not much older than Long Chen. He was wearing medicinal apprentice robes, and his expression was arrogant as he looked down on Long Chen.Long Chen faintly smiled and flashed his tablet to him. He then walked right in under his shocked expression.Seeing his arrogant expression change so quickly to shock, Long Chen couldn\u2019t avoid being somewhat pleased.It seemed that the old him had been suppressed for just too long. Now that he could finally raise his head, he had started to become undisciplined and selfish. But he knew inside that he didn\u2019t have time to waste on such petty things.When he entered the inner division, Long Chen slapped his forehead; he had forgotten to ask whether grandmaster Yun Qi was even present. If he wasn\u2019t even here, wouldn\u2019t this entire visit have just been a waste?Just as he was regretting it, a young lady walked past him. Without even thinking about it, he stopped her and asked, \u201cExcuse me, do you know where grandmaster Yun Qi is?\u201dThat young lady had been walking with her head down, and she appeared slightly irritated to be stopped out of nowhere. Raising her head, she saw a thin and weak youngster looking at her. She coldly said, \u201cWhy are you looking for grandmaster Yun Qi?\u201dLong Chen became slightly distracted. This woman was extremely pretty; she might not be comparable to Chu Yao and Meng Qi, but she was definitely a rare beauty that could only be found one every thousand miles.But although she was pretty, her gaze caused people to feel a bit unwell. Her gaze contained an unconcealed arrogance that made it difficult for people to feel well about her.\u201cI just want to know where grandmaster Yun Qi is. Can this young miss tell me?\u201d Long Chen might be a bit displeased inside, but he still continued asking very politely.\u201cJust who are you? Why are you looking to see grandmaster Yun Qi?\u201d she guardedly asked.Being questioned twice instead of being answered, Long Chen shook his head and no longer bothered with her. He went deeper in to look for someone else to ask.\u201cHey, I\u2019m asking you a question. Why are you so rude?\u201d She became angry when he didn\u2019t reply despite her asking twice.Long Chen only just took a couple of steps before turning to look at her. \u201cYou\u2019re here for medicine right?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked distractedly.\u201cYou must have a mental illness, so don\u2019t run around all over the place.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s cold reply had just rung out, and he was just turning to leave, when unexpectedly, a strong gale appeared behind him. Her palm charged toward his heart along with an angry shout.\u201cBrat, you\u2019re asking for death!\u201dLong Chen was quite startled inside; that lady had appeared weak and frail, but her attack caused wind so powerful that it made it difficult for him to breathe. She was shockingly at the peak of Qi Condensation.As for the palm attack she sent towards him, it contained her absolute strength.Because all of Long Chen\u2019s spiritual energy was hidden within his FengFu Star, he appeared like a very weak scholar. Even ordinary Qi Condensation cultivators would be heavily injured by such a palm. If he really was a normal mortal, it would be very possible for him to die. This uncalled for attack was extremely vicious.Since Long Chen was already irritated with her, he also didn\u2019t hold himself back and sent out a kick.Bang!Before her palm could even reach Long Chen, his kick smashed into her stomach and sent her flying back.The woman was sent several meters back before colliding into a drying shelf for medicinal ingredients. The tall shelf collapsed, and all the ingredients on it tumbled down and buried her beneath them.With an angry roar, the medicinal ingredients exploded out as she rushed out, her hair a complete mess and covered in traces of medicinal powder.\u201cDie!\u201d Flames were practically shooting out of her eyes and the aura around her body exploded out. Slamming her hands together, a golden ripple appeared from her hands and she rushed towards Long Chen.Long Chen cursed his bad luck at encountering such a brutish woman. How did he end up encountering such a lunatic today?This attack was clearly a Battle Skill with extremely great power. Seeing that she wanted to take his life, Long Chen\u2019s face turned cold.He had a Pill God\u2019s soul, and so he had some superficial battle experience from that. But describing it as superficial was only in regards to a Pill God.She was really just an ant to him. His \u2018superficial\u2019 experience was more than enough. Having such an experience gave him great skills, and handling her was a piece of cake.The only reason she wasn\u2019t injured from his kick was because he hadn\u2019t suffused any spiritual energy into it. But she wasn\u2019t grateful for this and instead wanted to kill him.Killing intent gradually condensed within Long Chen. Seeing this woman charge at him, he might not kill her, but if she dared to come at him, Long Chen would teach her an unforgettable lesson.\u201cStand down!\u201dA cold shout suddenly rang out. That crazy woman immediately seemed to have been struck by lightning and didn\u2019t dare move an inch.\u201cMaster,\u201d she hastily called out respectfully.The person who had arrived was surprisingly grandmaster Yun Qi. Long Chen was shocked. This crazy woman was actually his apprentice?Grandmaster Yun Qi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve already said that I, Yun Qi, will never accept an apprentice in this lifetime. You wasting your time hanging around here is useless.\u201d\u201cMaster, I\u2019m a weak woman. I\u2019ve traveled thousands of miles in order to study pill arts from you and I\u2019ve already stayed at the alchemist guild for three months. Do you really think I\u2019m not sincere enough?\u201d said the woman somewhat aggrievedly.\u201cYou can go back from where you came,\u201d said the unmoved grandmaster Yun Qi indifferently.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave! You can refuse me every day, but I\u2019ll stay here until you finally accept me,\u201d replied the woman stubbornly.\u201cUp to you. But remember, physical force is not allowed within my guild. If you break this rule again, I\u2019ll expel you,\u201d said Yun Qi coldly.He then turned to Long Chen and said, \u201cCome with me.\u201dLong Chen was dazed for a moment. So this crazy woman actually wanted to study pill refining with Yun Qi, but Yun Qi was not the slightest bit tempted.Seeing her bitter gaze, Long Chen suddenly realized that she had mistakenly assumed him to be another person wanting to have Yun Qi as a master, and that was why she had questioned him.Long Chen shook his head. Who would dare take such an apprentice? Following behind grandmaster Yun Qi, the two of them entered a training room.Once they entered the training room, Long Chen quickly bowed and said, \u201cSorry, this youngster was disrespectful.\u201dYun Qi smiled slightly. \u201cNo matter. That wasn\u2019t your fault. I saw everything that happened. But you really do cause me great shock. You were able to kick a peak Qi Condensation expert flying without the slightest spiritual energy. I also saw that you didn\u2019t use even half of your strength; otherwise, that girl would definitely have been heavily injured. You really hid yourself deeply.\u201dLong Chen was startled; apparently, he had underestimated grandmaster Yun Qi. As expected, this old fellow was extremely sharp. For a moment he didn\u2019t know how to reply.\u201cChild, everyone has their own secrets. This is nothing. However, a person like you cannot waste his time. Otherwise, such a great talent will be completely wasted.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi seemed to hint some kind of deeper meaning.Long Chen quickly realized that grandmaster Yun Qi was trying to tell him that he hoped Long Chen would focus all his attention on the cultivating the pill path.\u201cMany thanks for the reminder, grandmaster. Long Chen understands.\u201dNo matter how he put it, grandmaster Yun Qi definitely had good intentions for him. Whether he took his advice or not, this kindness was appreciated.\u201cI heard yesterday that you used just three strokes of a blade to kill a half-step Blood Condensation expert. Is it true?\u201d asked grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d Long Chen could only nod. But at the same time, some doubt arose within him. Back then, he had been completely surrounded by soldiers; according to common sense, no one else should know about it.As if seeing through Long Chen\u2019s doubt, grandmaster Yun Qi smiled and said, \u201cPeople from the imperial family came to investigate here yesterday, asking if Long Chen really was one of our alchemists. I told them yes, and I also said you were my student. They then disappeared.\u201dLong Chen couldn\u2019t help being stunned that the grandmaster Yun Qi who personally said he would never take an apprentice would take this moment to recognize him. He was naturally extremely moved. \u201cMany thanks, teacher.\u201d\u201cHehe. It wasn\u2019t much. My symbol is something that only has value if used, so feel free. In addition, a student is not the same as an apprentice.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi calmly smiled.Although calling him his student took just a slight effort from grandmaster Yun Qi, but to Long Chen, it was incredibly helpful.With grandmaster Yun Qi as his support, he now had a huge trump card available. He would be able to stand with his back much straighter now.\u201cChild, I\u2019ve also learned a bit about your circumstances. The alchemist guild has its own rules, and we are unable to involve ourselves in secular battles, so I can only help you this much,\u201d sighed grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201cGrandmaster, you\u2019ve done so much for this little one that I cannot thank you enough. As for the battles in the secular world, I will handle them myself,\u201d smiled Long Chen.With the reputation of grandmaster Yun Qi behind him, his affairs would become much more convenient. The safety of the Long estate would also rise by a great deal.Although the alchemist guild wouldn\u2019t interfere in battles that didn\u2019t involve them, as long as Long Chen really became a part of it, he would still gain the alchemist guild\u2019s protection.Once Long Chen gained enough strength of his own and didn\u2019t need the alchemist guild\u2019s protection, then he could personally resolve the heavy fog surrounding the mystery around him.Although he had some clues now, he didn\u2019t dare to take action right now. Maintaining the current situation was the best choice for him.\u201cSo why did you come here today?\u201d asked Yun Qi.Only now did Long Chen remember his true purpose of coming here. \u201cThis youngster wishes to buy some medicinal ingredients on credit with the guild, and once I refine them into pills, I will pay it back.\u201dWithdrawing medicinal ingredients on credit was quite common for alchemists within the guild. They would be able to pay it back easily with medicinal pills the next time. This was a good deal for both alchemists and the guild.With the guild\u2019s tablet, he was able to buy medicinal ingredients at a discount, but at the same time, he had a duty to first sell his refined pills to the guild. This was the agreement struck when the guild handed him the tablet.\u201cYou can refine pills?\u201d Yun Qi was somewhat shocked.\u201cI would like to ask some pointers from teacher.\u201d Long Chen smiled just slightly, but that smile was full of confidence.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Most of them were already over forty years old, and even the youngest was in his thirties.For a fifteen-year-old youngster to now claim that he wanted to refine pills, all of them were stunned and had trouble believing it. Some of them were even shaking their heads in ridicule inside.But they were all smart people and had all long since heard that grandmaster Yun Qi had made an exception and given a youth a Pill Apprentice tablet. Although they didn\u2019t know if that rumor was true, none of them were foolish enough to display their contempt.\u201cLong Chen, although I am the chairman of the guild, even I cannot break the customs. If you want to get medicinal ingredients on credit, you have to refine a pill in front of all these alchemists. We will then use the refined pill\u2019s quality to decide how much you can take on credit,\u201d explained grandmaster Yun Qi solemnly.\u201cThis little one understands.\u201d Long Chen understood that this was the alchemist guild and wasn\u2019t owned by anyone. Moreover, with grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s manner of doing things, there was no way he would give him preferential treatment that went against the rules.\u201cThere are 187 types of first tier medicinal pill formulas here. You can randomly pick one.\u201d One of the alchemists brought over a paper. Within his eyes was some hidden anticipation for Long Chen\u2019s failure.All the pill formulas on the page he had brought over were not just ordinary first tier pills. Their difficulties were all above average, and ordinary Pill Apprentices would not have a high success rate with them.Moreover, in a situation where all the alchemists were there watching you, in addition to grandmaster Yun Qi himself, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for someone to become nervous. In such an atmosphere, trying to refine a successful medicinal pill was extremely difficult.The person who handed Long Chen that page was also just a Pill Apprentice. He was already over forty years old now; back when he had been attempting to pass the alchemist test, he had failed seventeen times before passing.Everyone else present was all on the same level as him. All of them had used over ten attempts before passing.It could be seen that to be able to get medicinal ingredients in advance from the guild was not an easy task. But if you succeeded, it would become much more convenient for you in the future.Long Chen read through the entire page and pointed to the last pill formula. \u201cThat one.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re sure?\u201dThat person\u2019s expression became a bit strange. That pill formula was for the Qi Eruption Pill; it was an exceptionally domineering pill formula.For a short time, it allowed someone to explode with almost three times the amount of battle power.The Qi Eruption Pill was something which adventurers were very fond of. Although using it would cause someone to enter a weak state after its effect wore off, it didn\u2019t leave behind a permanent sequela.To people who spent all their days fighting Magical Beasts, the Qi Eruption Pill was definitely a life-saving treasure.But refining it was extremely difficult. There were several ingredients which possessed tyrannical medicinal energy. Even amongst experienced Pill Apprentices, there were extremely few who would refine it.After all, refining pills were not without risk. Although medicinal pills could be sold for high prices, their ingredients were not nothing. Medicinal ingredients also cost money.The ingredients for the Qi Eruption Pill were extremely expensive. If you were unable to successfully refine it within three attempts, you would end up losing money.Therefore, there were few people who refined this pill. Too high of a price was also something adventurers were unable to afford. After all, if they had so much money, who would risk their life adventuring into dangerous places for treasures?\u201cYes, I pick that one,\u201d calmly said Long Chen. He didn\u2019t seem to bother at all with the anticipation in that person\u2019s eyes.Grandmaster Yun Qi smiled slightly. He got a child messenger to go and get three sets of medicinal ingredients. This was the rule; you would only have three portions and as long as you succeeded once, it would be considered passing.Once all the ingredients were placed neatly in front of Long Chen, he didn\u2019t have any hesitation. Taking out his pill furnace, a weak yellow flame arose from his hand.In one breath\u2019s time, Long Chen gently brought his Pill Flame\u2019s energy over to the medicinal cauldron, slowly starting to heat it up. The next step was starting the cauldron; after heating it up, he had to use Spiritual Strength to urge the Pill Flame to enter into the cauldron.The benefits from doing this were that it allowed for the entire cauldron to enter the correct state and reduced the chance of a cauldron explosion.Long Chen actually had higher quality methods, but he had no choice but to use the alchemist guild\u2019s most basic techniques.He didn\u2019t want himself to appear too shocking to others. That would not be of benefit to him in the future. If someone were to secretly turn against him, that person could cause a lot of trouble for him.The people present originally considered Long Chen to be beneath them, but seeing his very practiced and skilled movements, the contempt on everyone\u2019s faces faded by quite a bit.Once all the preparations were complete, Long Chen didn\u2019t hesitate before throwing in an Iron Thread Grass to refine.This action of his caused everyone, who had just started to become interested in him, to immediately think he was stupid.The Iron Thread Grass required an extremely long time to refine. It was usually done later when the medicinal cauldron had completely heated up.Only grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s eyes flashed with a strange light as he secretly nodded.What astonished everyone was that as soon as the Iron Thread Grass entered the refinement, before it even turned to powder, it was ejected from Long Chen\u2019s cauldron and placed to the side as he started refining a different medicinal ingredient.Once he finished with the sixth ingredient, Long Chen started refining the Iron Thread Grass once more, but he didn\u2019t complete its refinement before starting to refine a different herb.This action was something none of them understood, but seeing grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s eyes filled with admiration, they all couldn\u2019t help being startled. Could this youth\u2019s techniques really have some kind of secret behind them?Long Chen refined the Iron Thread Grass a total of thirteen times before completely refining it. At this stage, all of the twenty-something medicinal ingredients had been refined.Under normal circumstances, a Pill Apprentice would normally take this chance to take a breath and calm their nerves.But Long Chen didn\u2019t waste even that slightest bit of time. After refining all of them into powders, he directly started refining the pill. He started throwing in powder after powder into the pill furnace.What none of them could understand was why Long Chen waited until the end to put the Iron Thread Grass\u2019 essence powder into the cauldron.With the circulation of his Spiritual Strength, the Pill Flame quickly shot up, and ripples from the heat appeared as Long Chen truly began his pill refinement.\u201cWhat a powerful Spiritual Strength!\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t help but feel shocked. But at the same time, they also shook their heads. If he started wasting his Spiritual Strength to increase the flame\u2019s strength now, how could he condense the pill later? It appeared that young people really were too impatient.Grandmaster Yun Qi was completely engrossed with his actions. In this place, only he understood what Long Chen\u2019s intention was. At the same time, he also started to like Long Chen more and more; with such a powerful soul and the ability to work hard, it was definitely possible for him to have great achievements in life.What caused disbelief in everyone was that even after an hour, Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength didn\u2019t show any signs of weakening, but was actually becoming stronger and stronger.Bang!The medicinal cauldron started to gently shake, and a powerful undulation came from it. Everyone\u2019s gaze focused; they all knew that this was the most critical moment.With the medicinal cauldron continuously shaking, most alchemists would lower the Pill Flame\u2019s power to stabilize the cauldron.But Long Chen didn\u2019t do that at all; on the contrary, he fed in even more Spiritual Strength and the Pill Flame became even hotter. The sounds and shaking from the cauldron became even more intense.\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201dAll of their expressions changed. This wasn\u2019t refining pills; this was causing a cauldron explosion! He was clearly doing it on purpose!BOOM!The medicinal cauldron jumped and Long Chen suddenly used one hand to tightly press down on the cauldron\u2019s lid. A sudden burst of powerful Spiritual Strength completely exploded out.BANG!The near-exploding pill furnace immediately stopped and returned to calm.What a messy method! It\u2019s such a waste of energy. Long Chen wiped away his sweat. Using this method to refine pills really was exhausting. But it was important that he didn\u2019t reveal his true strength. He could only display this basic, bitter method.Gently lifting the cauldron lid, a dense pill fragrance immediately filled the air. Everyone was completely shocked.\u201cHe actually succeeded!\u201dEveryone present could be considered experts, so without even needing to look inside the cauldron and relying just on the pill fragrance, they knew that he had succeeded. Most of their expressions were filled with astonishment.\u201cExcellent. At the very least it should be a middle grade medicinal pill.\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi was looking at Long Chen in admiration. Long Chen had definitely far surpassed his expectations.He had known that with Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength, it would not be difficult to successfully refine a pill. But he had wanted to see how good Long Chen\u2019s foundation was.But today he saw that Long Chen\u2019s foundational techniques were incomparably sturdy and not at all inferior to Pill Apprentices who had trained for many years.The most remarkable thing was Long Chen\u2019s deep understanding of medicinal essence. He knew that the Iron Thread Grass was extremely fierce in nature and required multiple refinements to curb that violent nature. Doing so would allow the pill\u2019s energy to increase and at the same time, increase the chance of a successful refinement.Such a refining method was something no one within the alchemist guild knew about. But within the guild was a secret warehouse of rare tomes. A couple seniors had made recordings there.The writings were unfortunately very vague, but it did have this theory: by refining the Iron Thread Grass multiple times, it should be possible to reduce its violent nature.But those recordings only mentioned extremely ordinary techniques or incomplete ideas. When it came to alchemists, who would be so kind as to just give away their blood, sweat, and tears?Let alone the others, even grandmaster Yun Qi, who knew about this recording, had never mentioned this method of refining the Iron Thread Grass.One reason was that he had no obligation to go and teach others, and the other was that alchemists who weren\u2019t capable of innovation would not have any great achievements anyways.When the others heard grandmaster Yun Qi say that it was a middle grade medicinal pill, they were all in complete disbelief.Looking at the gazes all focused on him, Long Chen smiled slightly. With a wave of his hand, his spiritual energy pulled out five fully round medicinal pills.Along two of the pills were some shocking eye-attracting veins\u2014pill lines. This was a characteristic of middle grade pills.For a moment, the entire room was silent. Other than grandmaster Yun Qi, everyone\u2019s eyes were filled with shock, admiration, and of course, a trace of jealousy.Seeing the five pills in his hands, Long Chen finally relaxed. Grandmaster Yun Qi took this moment to announce, \u201cLong Chen has succeeded in refining a pill. I reward him a second class credit.\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions changed at that. A second class credit was a privilege that allowed you to buy second-tier medicinal pill ingredients. This caused everyone\u2019s eyes to turn red with envy.In front of everyone\u2019s complicated gazes, Long Chen followed grandmaster Yun Qi out of the room. However, once they were out, Yun Qi suddenly turned to Long Chen and gravely said the following:\u201cLong Chen, be wary of that woman.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 WildePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeLong Chen was surprised and confused. Which woman did he mean?\u201cThat girl that fought with you at the beginning,\u201d Yun Qi said solemnly.\u201cWhat? Does she have a problem?\u201d asked Long Chen in confusion.Grandmaster Yun Qi hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cCome with me.\u201dLong Chen followed grandmaster Yun Qi to the cultivation room they had gone to before. He couldn\u2019t help being curious; she was just at the peak of Qi Condensation, so there was no reason for grandmaster Yun Qi to specifically warn him about her.They entered the room and closed the door before grandmaster Yun Qi touched his spatial ring and took out a drawing.Opening the drawing, Long Chen was started to see that it depicted a beautiful, delicate woman refining pills in front of an ancient medicinal cauldron.What shocked him was that that woman in the drawing was almost exactly like that crazy woman he had encountered.The only difference was that the woman in the painting was serene and full of peace, giving people a gentle feeling. The feeling which that crazy woman gave off was completely different.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Long Chen probingly asked. That drawing was extremely old. Just why had Yun Qi taken it out?\u201cThe person in this drawing is my wife.\u201d A rarely seen warmth appeared on grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s solemn face when he looked at the person in the drawing.Long Chen\u2019s mouth dropped. That was something he had never expected. For a moment he didn\u2019t know what to say.After a moment, Yun Qi gently put away the drawing and sighed, \u201cMy wife passed away a long time ago. When I first saw that woman, I thought I was hallucinating. It took me a long time before I calmed myself down. But as soon as that woman said she wanted to be my apprentice, I immediately felt my guard go up.\u201d\u201cWhat? Does she have some kind of secret goal?\u201d asked Long Chen.Yun Qi smiled slightly and didn\u2019t reply to that. \u201cShe is also a Pill Apprentice and has an excellent talent. She might even be better than you, so you have to be careful around her.\u201dLong Chen was somewhat mystified by this, but grandmaster Yun Qi no longer said anything about it. He took Long Chen\u2019s jade tablet and carved his own special engraving on it.That engraving had a trace of his Spiritual Strength. With it, Long Chen would be able to get quite a few precious medicinal ingredients from the alchemist guild\u2019s medicinal room on credit.He sent Long Chen out as soon as he finished that engraving. Countless questions bounced around in Long Chen\u2019s head.Perhaps the arrival of that crazy woman wasn\u2019t a coincidence. If she had done it on purpose, then what was her goal?Was she there to seduce grandmaster Yun Qi? But with his age, that didn\u2019t seem too likely.And if that had been the goal, shouldn\u2019t she be a bit more docile? Who would fall in love with such a wild crazy woman?Did grandmaster Yun Qi have some other secrets? Was it possible that she was some illegitimate daughter of his?But that also didn\u2019t sound right. If he had had an illegitimate daughter, she wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with his wife, yet they looked so similar.He got a headache from thinking about it, yet he still couldn\u2019t figure it out. But in any case, grandmaster Yun Qi wouldn\u2019t harm him, so he should just do as he said and be more careful of her.He went directly to the medicinal ingredient room with his jade tablet. When he showed it off, the assistant\u2019s expression immediately became extremely respectful.Long Chen asked about the credit procedure. He learned that the first class credit users could borrow five million gold coins worth of medicinal ingredients that were limited to the first tier.But Long Chen\u2019s second class credit allowed him to borrow thirty million gold coins of first tier medicinal ingredients, as well as five sets of second tier medicinal ingredients.This kind of result made this trip well worth it. With such a credit limit he would no longer need to be worried about not being able to afford medicinal ingredients.Normally, if an alchemist could succeed in refining one out of five times, then he would end up breaking even. If he could succeed an extra time then he would make a great profit.As for Long Chen with his Pill God memories, his chance of failure when refining a first tier medicinal pill was zero percent. If his Pill Flame wasn\u2019t so weak, his efficiency in the number of pills per furnace would increase even more.But when he thought about refining second tier medicinal pills, Long Chen decided not to try it. With his current Pill Flame\u2019s strength, refining a second tier pill would tire him to death.For the moment, he should continue focusing on condensing his FengFu Star. The current initial success of his FengFu Star still had an extremely great room for improvement. He wanted to condense his FengFu Star to its perfect state.Long Chen wanted to spend all of his money to buy the FengFu Pill\u2019s ingredients, but he was disappointed to find that the guild didn\u2019t have that kind of quantity in stock.Without any other choice, he bought fifty sets of the ingredients as well as a couple of other first tier medicinal ingredients. Once he refined them into medicinal pills, he could sell them to the guild and make money that way.Martial arts were prevalent within the Phoenix Cry Empire, and with so many people and adventurers, medicinal pills were always in high demand and were in a situation where the supply could never meet the demand.Fortunately, the alchemist guild had a conscience and didn\u2019t evilly increase the price; otherwise, the guild would definitely start making money hand over fist.Long Chen was planning on going straight to his room after leaving the guild. But before he got home, he suddenly heard a bunch of shouts and curses, so he hastily walked over to look.He saw ten servants were currently beating someone. There was a very round, fat, middle-aged man pointing at that person while cursing.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked of a man watching the chaos.\u201cHehe, you\u2019ll laugh to death once you hear it. Do you see that chimney that\u2019s over two hundred meters tall? It was built by that kid. The boss came to do an inspection today, and when he saw it, he almost died of anger. That idiot read the blueprints upside down. He was actually supposed to be building a well, hahaha\u2026\u201dLong Chen also choked on his laughter when he heard that. Did people like that really exist in this world? Seeing that person being beaten on the ground, his heart shook slightly.That person didn\u2019t seem to be that old; he probably wasn\u2019t even older than Long Chen. But his body was exceptionally long and strong. He was just lying on the ground and letting those people hit him without retaliating.What shocked Long Chen was that whenever those people\u2019s punches or kicks landed on his body, an indescribable energy came out of his body and deflected them away.Without Long Chen\u2019s shocking Spiritual Strength, it would be impossible to notice that faint ripple. But as for that youth, there were no spiritual energy fluctuations from him and so he definitely wasn\u2019t a cultivator.That youth simply lay there for a long time without reaction, and the result was that the people beating him eventually got tired, their hands and feet starting to ache.\u201cDamn, he really angers me to death. Just how much money is this idiot going to cost me? Beat him to death!\u201dThat fat boss became angrier whenever he looked at the huge chimney in front of him. He repeatedly cursed and went over to kick him a couple of times.\u201cStop.\u201d\u201cDamnit, who do you think you are?\u201d That boss was so angry he didn\u2019t even look at who was speaking before cursing. Only then did he look for the speaker.As soon as he did, he immediately started to sweat and stuttered, \u201cYoung\u2026 master\u2026\u201d\u201cJust stop. Here are a hundred gold coins, enough to tear down the chimney and build a new well.\u201d Long Chen was too lazy to argue or haggle with such a person, so he just directly threw a bag of gold coins to him. If he could resolve a problem with just a little money, then he was disinclined to take further action.The others all saw this and quickly stopped. The fat boss quickly said, \u201cYoung master, this\u2026\u201d\u201cTake it and get out of here.\u201d Long Chen frowned and his voice became cold.When he looked at that man\u2019s face, Long Chen knew that he was an idiot who would try to form some kind of good relation with him. So he directly ordered him away; this kind of person would make him lose face.\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll leave right away.\u201dHe quickly brought everyone away dejectedly.\u201cLittle brother, please get up,\u201d said Long Chen to the youth who was still just lying on the ground.The youth seemed as if he was sleeping. Only when Long Chen called out did he blankly raise his head and realize that the people beating him had gone.\u201cAre you the person who saved me?\u201d he asked confusedly.\u201cGet up and then we\u2019ll talk,\u201d smiled Long Chen. That youth seemed to be one hundred percent honest and kind, giving people a good impression.When he stood up, the people who had been watching the fuss all let out shocked cries. While he had been lying on the ground, they had only realized that he was a bit big, but now that he stood up, he completely shocked everyone.He was approximately three meters tall. He was practically a giant, and he gave people an extremely pressuring feeling.\u201cHow tall.\u201d Long Chen was also surprised. In front of him, everyone else there had become children in comparison.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fight back when they were beating you?\u201d Seeing how strong-bodied he was and the fact that the people attacking him weren\u2019t martial artists, Long Chen believed he could have easily knocked them all down.\u201cThey said I did something bad, so I couldn\u2019t fight back when they hit me,\u201d he simple-mindedly replied.Long Chen shook his head. This huge fellow might be strong, but it seemed his intelligence was still at the level of a child. No wonder he was so honest and na\u00efve. But to mistake a well in the blueprints and end up building a huge chimney, that kind of intelligence was definitely worrying.\u201cWhere\u2019s your house?\u201d\u201cI have no house. Does your house need any hard labor? I\u2019m very big, and I don\u2019t need a salary as long I get some food. I\u2019m very hungry,\u201d he implored.Just as he was about to reply, someone reminded him, \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t be fooled. This fellow can easily eat a whole bull in an instant. Taking him in isn\u2019t profitable.\u201d\u201cNo, as long as there\u2019s rice it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need meat,\u201d he somewhat urgently said.\u201cFine, come with me. What\u2019s your name?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cI\u2019m called Wild Bull. Thank you, big bro,\u201d Wild Bull happily said.\u201cHm, I\u2019ll call you Wilde in the future. You can just call me brother Long.\u201d Long Chen nodded.[1]\u201cOkay brother Long.\u201d Wilde straightforwardly nodded his head.The people in the crowd left behind by Long Chen and Wilde all became jealous. They were jealous of that idiot who had become favored by a noble heir. Stupid people really did have stupid luck.On the road, Long Chen asked Wilde about his past. Wilde said that he had been picked up by some nice people, but once he turned five, an epidemic took the lives of everyone in his village except for him.He had managed to roam around all the way to the imperial capital. He was able to get food from people by trading labor, but because his appetite was too big, he was quickly turned away, so his everyday life was extremely bitter.\u201cWilde, you can follow me in the future. I won\u2019t let you be hungry again.\u201d Sympathy arose in Long Chen\u2019s heart.As the saying went, arrogant people end up with arrogant people, while sufferers end up with other sufferers. Although the two of them had different statuses, they had both gone through much pain. They weren\u2019t that different except that Long Chen had managed to turn his luck around just recently.As they walked, they ended up in a wide road when suddenly startled shouts rang out and a massive silhouette shot past them.That was a luxurious carriage being pulled by a Scarlet Yak, a first rank Magical Beast. Its wild pulling took over half the entire road, not taking the surrounding people into any consideration.A five-year-old girl was playing on the road when she suddenly saw the giant Scarlet Yak and was immediately scared stiff. She was petrified, unable to even dodge. At any second, it would run her over.Long Chen coldly snorted, stepping forward explosively, causing several of the sturdy floor tiles beneath his feet to shatter. He was like a bolt of lightning, immediately reaching and grabbing the girl, hastily pulling her to the side.The carriage shot past the two of them just as he stabilized himself. Long Chen thought that that would be it, but an angry cry rang out.\u201cWhat lowly slave dares block my path? You\u2019re asking for death!\u201dAlong with this cold shout, a long whip whistled through the air, shooting towards Long Chen.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 How BoldPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cWhat lowly slave dares block my path? You\u2019re asking for death!\u201dAlong with this cold shout, a long whip whistled through the air as it shot towards Long Chen.That whip moved extremely quickly and craftily. The person attacking him was surprisingly a whip master. Long Chen should have been able to dodge, but it was more difficult with him holding the little girl.Fury arose within him; it was now already too late for him to dodge. Protecting the little girl, he used his spiritual energy to protect his body and prepared to forcibly take the blow on his arm.Just at that moment, a huge figure arrived in front of Long Chen.Bang!Wilde grinned at Long Chen. It was he who took the blow on his back for Long Chen.Long Chen\u2019s eyes darkened. He wanted to see exactly who it was that had attacked, but that carriage was already speeding away.A surprised sound came from it, as that person clearly was startled by Wilde\u2019s arrival. However, the carriage still didn\u2019t stop.\u201cAre you okay Wilde?\u201d asked Long Chen, suppressing his anger.\u201cBrother Long, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve been hit so many times since I was a child that I\u2019m already used to it,\u201d grinned Wilde.But the clothing on his back was torn, exposing his skin. A line of blood was slowly flowing out.A woman suddenly came by and grabbed the girl. She wept inconsolably as she thanked Long Chen and Wilde.Wilde smiled goofily, and Long Chen consoled her with a couple of words before leaving.But Long Chen was stifling a stomach of anger. To barge down such a busy and crowded road and actually hit someone with a whip\u2026 Long Chen was planning on having a good look into the person who dared be so bold.Although Wilde\u2019s wound that was dripping with blood appeared frightening, it was just a flesh wound.This amazed Long Chen; just how powerful was Wilde\u2019s physical body? That person, who had attacked viciously, was extremely powerful, but his attack only broke Wilde\u2019s skin.As the two of them walked, Wilde\u2019s stomach suddenly let out a growl that was as loud as thunder. Long Chen stopped distractedly, suddenly realizing that there was a bun store right beside them from which the smell of meat was wafting out of.Wilde embarrassingly said, \u201cBrother Long, I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m hungry, so let\u2019s go have a snack.\u201d Long Chen brought Wilde into the bun store and found a table for the two of them to sit at. Directly handing a gold coin to the owner, he said, \u201cBring out all the buns in your store.\u201d\u201cBrother Long, I\u2019m really not hungry. I only need some rice,\u201d Wilde hastily said.That was because he had had countless experiences of people seeing him eat and immediately breaking off relations with him. Wilde was afraid of this calamity repeating itself again.\u201cWilde, you blocked a whip for me. From now on, you\u2019re like a brother to me, and I, Long Chen, would also block a whip for you. Therefore, you shouldn\u2019t say anything to me that you wouldn\u2019t say to a brother, okay?\u201d Long Chen seriously said.Wilde was someone who had blocked a whip for him after only just meeting him. Such a person was worthy of being called brother by Long Chen.\u201cBrother Long\u2026 I\u2026\u201dWilde suddenly began to cry loudly. In all his years of homeless wandering, this was the first time he felt this warmth and the first time someone ever treated him this well.\u201cGood bro, don\u2019t cry. Between us brothers, we don\u2019t cry, we sweat. Tears are for cowards.\u201d Long Chen patted Wilde\u2019s shoulder.\u201cOkay brother Long. I\u2019ll listen to you. Whatever you want me to do, I\u2019ll do.\u201d Wilde wiped away his tears.Long Chen considered telling him that he should have some more confidence, but when he thought about how he had mistakenly built a chimney instead of a well, he decided against it.At this time, the owner of the bun shop brought over a basket. Long Chen smiled, \u201cWilde, eat as much as you want. Brother Long has plenty of money, so don\u2019t hold back for me.\u201dWilde nodded and no longer stood on courtesy. The fist-sized buns were swallowed each with one bite, one after another.Although he had long since prepared himself, Long Chen was still shocked by Wilde\u2019s appetite. Even after all of the over three hundred meat buns had been eaten, Wilde still seemed to want more.By now, the owner was extremely anxious. All his buns were gone now, and there was no way for him to make more in such a short time.Three hundred buns were only about six silver coins. But when he went to give Long Chen the change, the two of them had already left.When the two of them returned to Long Chen\u2019s home, he first brought Wilde to see his mother. Mrs. Long was quite frightened at first due to how large Wilde was.But after seeing Wilde was so easy-going and childlike, she quickly calmed down. When Long Chen told her what Wilde had been through, Mrs. Long immediately agreed to let him stay with them.Once Wilde was settled down, Long Chen went to go refine pills. While refining in his own home, he didn\u2019t need to be worried so much as in the alchemist guild, so he unleashed his powerful Spiritual Strength fully, quickly increasing his pill refining speed to its peak.Three full days passed before Long Chen once more came out of his room. He had unceasingly refined for three days and three nights. He now held almost a hundred FengFu Pills, and all of them were middle grade.Other than the FengFu Pill, Long Chen had also refined the very popular Blood Condensing Pill, Qi Condensing Pill, the Poison Cure Pill, etc. These were all to be sold to the guild to pay back his credit loan.Just as Long Chen exited his room, Bao-er walked over with an embarrassed expression. Long Chen couldn\u2019t help distractedly asking, \u201cBao-er, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d Bao-er was a bit flustered.\u201cWhatever it is, just tell me,\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cWell uh\u2026 in the house\u2026 there\u2019s\u2026 no more food,\u201d she uneasily said.Wilde\u2019s appetite really was just too great. Knowing how pitiful Wilde\u2019s life had been, Mrs. Long had specifically told the kitchen to make more food.But the result was that just three days later, over a month\u2019s supply of the Long family\u2019s food had been eaten. Mrs. Long had secretly taken out a piece of jewelry for Bao-er to go sell.Bao-er had felt that this kind of thing should first be consulted with Long Chen, so she had come to find him.Long Chen laughed and patted her head. \u201cLittle girl, you really have become smart. I\u2019ll handle this matter.\u201dBao-er was Long Chen\u2019s personal maid, and despite how poor the Long family had been, Bao-er was unwilling to leave. Long Chen had long since begun to see her as a little sister.\u201cYoung master, there\u2019s also not even enough food for dinner tonight,\u201d she reminded. At this point, she was practically the manager of the entire household. The bookkeeper had felt that there was no opportunity for advancement at the Long household, so he had long since left.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll handle it right now.\u201d Long Chen still had a few gold coins on him, but that was just chump change. He called over Wilde and the two of them left to go to the alchemist guild.There was no real reason why he had brought Wilde along. Long Chen just wanted to develop his thinking some more. Wisdom was related with experience after all.Arriving at the guild, Long Chen went directly to the medicinal ingredient room and handed over dozens of round medicinal pills to the youth in charge.This youth was scared witless; he clearly remembered that Long Chen had only come three days ago for these medicinal ingredients. How did he manage to come back with these medicinal pills in just three days? On average, it was around half a year before people came back with enough pills to pay off their credit.Putting aside his shock, he dutifully took them and professionally examined each one.Seventeen middle grade and thirty-six low grade medicinal pills. Even though he had the utmost confidence in his tools, he was still in disbelief.When he confirmed that there was no mistake, he deducted the debt Long Chen had on credit. In the end, there were still some pills left over.\u201cMaster Long Chen, for these remaining medicinal pills, do you plan on using them to exchange for medicinal ingredients or should I exchange them for gold coins?\u201d the youth respectfully asked.\u201cConvert them all to gold coins.\u201d\u201cAlright, please wait a moment.\u201d That youth hastily flipped through a book with the most recent market prices for the medicinal pills. He had to calculate the price in accordance to that criterion.\u201cMaster Long, in total, it\u2019s 8,170,000 gold coins.\u201dLong Chen nodded. The alchemist guild wasn\u2019t for-profit, so this price was very fair. It was only a tenth less than the market price, and being able to enjoy so many special treatments in exchange was definitely extremely worth it.\u201cGive it to me on two crystal cards. Two million on one card, and the rest on the other,\u201d said Long Chen.When he returned home, Bao-er was already waiting at the gates. She handed Long Chen a red invitation card. \u201cYoung master Shi Feng sent over an invitation to you.\u201dLong Chen opened it and smiled. Shi Feng had exited his seclusion after breaking into the Blood Condensation realm. He had prepared a feast in the Heroic Assembly House and invited everyone to celebrate with him. When he calculated how many days had passed, it seemed about right.\u201cBao-er, here. Do good work as the housekeeper and this young master will purchase you a generous dowry in the future, letting you marry in style,\u201d laughed Long Chen as he handed a crystal card to Bao-er.Bao-er\u2019s face was completely red, but when she saw the number on the card, her expression changed to complete disbelief.\u201cLittle rich girl, the Long household\u2019s future work will be handled by you. Oh right, go and buy back all of my mom\u2019s jewelry. Even if it costs you ten times as much, it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry young master, Bao-er will handle it properly.\u201d Bao-er patted her chest several times and stood completely straight with confidence.Long Chen nodded and brought Wilde along to the Heroic Assembly House.The Heroic Assembly House was a famous restaurant in the capital. The people who ate there were extremely rich. The main attraction was, of course, the imposing name, and adding on the good food, it became a favorite place for the royalty and nobility to party.At its top floor was a large round table. At this time, it was packed with all kinds of delicacies. However, at the moment, everyone was just idly chatting, and no one picked up their chopsticks.When they saw a certain figure walk in, everyone hastily stood up.\u201cBrother Long\u201c\u201cBrother Long\u201c\u201cLord Long\u201cShi Feng, Fatty Yu, and the others all called out to him, but when they saw Wilde behind them they all jumped.Shi Feng was already considered very large, but he was still small in front of Wilde.\u201cLet me introduce you to my brother, Wilde.\u201dWhen they heard his introduction, everyone hastily greeted Wilde, but all Wilde did was nod and foolishly laugh.Only when Long Chen arrived did they all sit down to eat. Shi Feng raised his glass. \u201cBrother Long, I won\u2019t say any unnecessary words. I, Shi Feng, toast to you!\u201dShi Feng deeply engraved his gratefulness to Long Chen in his heart. He would have needed several years before reaching the Blood Condensation realm, but now that he reached it so early, it would definitely be a huge help to him in the future, allowing him to reach even higher heights.\u201cWe all toast to you as well, brother Long!\u201dFatty Yu took the lead and everyone stood up. With the medicinal liquid Long Chen had given them, they had quickly begun sensing the spiritual qi of heaven and earth. Shou Hou from the Daybreak Marquis and fatty Yu had already reached the first Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.All this had only been possible due to Long Chen\u2019s support. Everyone was filled with gratitude to him.\u201cCheers!\u201dLong Chen laughed. No matter what, these people had all helped each other in troubled times. They were his good friends.After a couple of drinks, everyone started to chat. Only Wilde was completely focused on eating.Long Chen had intentionally asked Shi Feng to order some extra food. Luckily, Wilde had already eaten a lot before coming; otherwise, he might have scared fatty Yu and the others to death.Everyone was talking about their current situations. Not only were they full of vigor, but now that they could cultivate, their fortunes within their families had also risen in accord.The most important thing was the news that Long Chen had become a Pill Apprentice had passed throughout practically the entire imperial capital. Long Chen\u2019s relationship with fatty Yu and the others was something everyone knew about.Therefore, each of their families had secretly told them to make some good relations with him. This relieved them of the constant pressure they were under.Just as everyone was conversing, footsteps suddenly came from below. Shi Feng frowned. \u201cI definitely told the owner to keep an eye out. I already reserved the entire restaurant, so how is there still someone coming up?\u201d\u201cWhatever, having more people is also fun.\u201d Fatty Yu had clearly become a bit tipsy and his tongue had become loose.A voice rang out at this moment. \u201cEveryone in here get out. I don\u2019t want to have to eat with a bunch of lowly degenerates.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s expression immediately turned cold, and the veins in his hands jumped out angrily.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But now his face turned cold and blue veins popped out on his hands.That voice was very familiar to Long Chen. The familiarity caused Long Chen\u2019s killing intent to explode out, and this strangeness was noticed by everyone.\u201cBrother Long, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked fatty Yu. Seeing him in his murderous state, he immediately awoke from his tipsy state.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. When that person comes up, just act really annoying. Keep focus on celebrating with Shi Feng and put on a show of it,\u201d said Long Chen.Everyone realized that Long Chen was wanting to make a disturbance. Currently, they all had the support of their families and were told to form good relations with Long Chen as best as they could. How could they let such a good opportunity go?\u201cBrother Long, just watch.\u201d Shou Hou patted his chest confidently.The footsteps continued getting closer. A man in his twenties wearing a strange hat and long eyebrows entered the room.Long Chen didn\u2019t reveal his face and he also told Wilde not to either. The two of them had their backs facing that person.After that person came up, a bitter-faced man also came up behind him. He appeared to be the restaurant\u2019s shopkeeper.\u201cGet them all out. Otherwise, I\u2019ll blame you.\u201d That arrogant man didn\u2019t even place Long Chen\u2019s group within his arrogant eyes.Obviously, he felt that personally shooing them would reduce his status so he had the shopkeeper do it.\u201cOh my, have you guys noticed there\u2019s a weiner growing out of his head?\u201d Shou Hou said quietly to fatty Yu.Although it was said quietly, it wasn\u2019t a whisper. Anyone there could hear it completely clearly.Long Chen smiled. The strange hat on that man\u2019s head did have a long protuberance at the front. At first, he hadn\u2019t noticed, but once Shou Hou said it, he realized that it really was similar.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to make a fuss about. I bet his dad was too corrupt and other people cursed it there.\u201d Fatty Yu looked somewhat disdainfully at Shou Hou.\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Shou Hou confused.\u201cWow, have you not heard about the curse before? They curse you to have a son with a penis growing on his head?\u201d\u201cOh, brother really is wise,\u201d Shou Hou said admiringly.When the shopkeeper saw everyone jeer and taunt this person, he turned pale with fright and quickly cast a meaningful look at Shi Feng.Unfortunately, Shi Feng, who had a slight relationship with the shopkeeper, didn\u2019t pay him any attention and acted as if he had never met him.That long-eyebrowed man\u2019s face became cold immediately, and he icily looked at fatty Yu. \u201cDamn fatass pig, are you guys looking to die?\u201dFatty Yu shook his head. \u201cBrother, seeing your bitter face, I can easily tell that someone close to you must have died. Was it your father? Your mother? Either way, now\u2019s not the time to eat and drink here.\u201d\u201cRight, that\u2019s too unfilial.\u201d\u201cSuch a son should be directly thrown into the streets.\u201d\u201cShh, stop. Don\u2019t you see him trembling? If we keep talking, he might go crazy and start foaming at the mouth. Then how will we be able to drink enjoy ourselves?\u201dThe power of teamwork was definitely amazing. Everyone heard fatty Yu and Shou Hou\u2019s taunts, so they all inserted their own ridicule. They definitely had to at least contribute their own jokes at such an opportunity.\u201cDie.\u201d With a short cry, a long whip appeared in that person\u2019s hand. The wind howled with biting cold killing intent. As it crashed down upon them, everyone realized that that whip had them all in range.Shi Feng had long since been prepared for this. With just a touch on his belt, a blade slashed out.The long blade and the flexible whip collided, emitting an explosive sound. Shi Feng felt a huge power hit him and was sent flying into the roof, shaking the entire restaurant.His face turned slightly red due to an internal injury, a sign that his blood and qi was about to overflow out of his control. He had shockingly been beaten in just one attack.\u201cGo die you urchins.\u201dAfter that first attack, his whip became like a poisonous dragon, immediately turning rigid and becoming like a sword stabbing towards Shi Feng\u2019s heart.This shocked everyone; they hadn\u2019t expected this person to be so ruthless. He was clearly intent on killing Shi Feng!That whip was too fast, and Shi Feng was unable to dodge it. Just when he thought he was about to die\u2026A large hand tightly grabbed the whip. It was now completely unable to move.\u201cBrother Long!\u201d Everyone cried out as Long Chen appeared beside Shi Feng. He appeared like a king amongst men as he coldly looked at that man.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d That man couldn\u2019t help being startled when he saw that it was Long Chen.\u201cGood, you still remember me.\u201d A cold smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face. He suddenly tugged on the whip and the man was startled to feel a huge force involuntarily pull him flying towards Long Chen.He was slightly startled, never expecting Long Chen\u2019s strength to be so great. Even a first Heavenstage of Blood Condensation expert like him couldn\u2019t resist.He sneered, and borrowing the force from being pulled over by Long Chen, he raised his leg and aimed it at Long Chen\u2019s stomach. His reactions were so quick that it dazzled and confused the others. This person was obviously a true expert.Seeing him rushing over, Long Chen also sent a kick out. Its speed wasn\u2019t that great, but it was perfectly timed such that it viciously landed on that person\u2019s crotch right before his attack reached Long Chen\u2019s stomach.The sound of something exploding caused everyone else\u2019s groins to turn cold. Goosebumps arose all along their backs.\u201cAHH!\u201dA miserable scream resounded through the restaurant. Everyone who heard that cry had their hair stood on end.But even such a blood-curdling cry was unable to relieve his pain. He rolled on the ground fiercely; his face contorted in pain, screaming.Due to these intense movements, his hat suddenly fell off, and fatty Yu and the others\u2019 expressions all changed.\u201cSomeone from the Grand Xia Empire?\u201dWhen the hat came off, it revealed an extremely ancient hair bun like a stretched out thumb. It was no wonder his hat was so strange.That hair bun was a mark of the Grand Xia. Only nobles with high status would style their hair like that.Everyone looked at each other in dismay, realizing that they had caused a huge disaster here. The Grand Xia and Phoenix Cry had a good relationship, and this kind of disaster could even influence the relations between the two empires. The consequences would be severe.Looking at the rolling man, the suppressed anger inside Long Chen loosened slightly. He handed the whip to Wilde and said, \u201cHe hit you. You can hit him back now.\u201d\u201cHit someone? I can\u2019t.\u201d Wilde hesitated.Long Chen\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYou won\u2019t listen to me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Seeing Long Chen\u2019s face darken, Wilde quickly became frightened. He had only ever known how it felt to be beaten; this would be the first time he hit back. He held the whip in his hand for a long moment of hesitation, not daring to strike.\u201cDo it!\u201d shouted Long Chen. He had to push Wilde to take this step; otherwise, he could only end up bullied for the rest of his life.\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Wilde took a deep breath and used the whip to attack him.\u201cHey!\u201dBut that scream wasn\u2019t from the man with the long eyebrows. It had come from the person closest to Wilde.\u201cBrother Wilde, you have to aim better.\u201d That person had to suppress his tears as he rubbed his thigh that Wilde had hit painfully.Wilde\u2019s face reddened. He had never used a whip. It was so light that he couldn\u2019t use any real force. Missing the person in front of him, he ended up hitting his neighbor.Long Chen sighed. This child needed to temper himself.\u201cContinue.\u201d When Long Chen shouted this, everyone immediately ran at least ten meters away. Only at that distance did they feel safer.Crack!This time Wilde had picked up a bit about how to use a whip, but he still ended up missing his target by almost three meters.The man with the long eyebrows was still tightly holding his groin, his face twisted in pain. He didn\u2019t pay any attention to Wilde\u2019s weak attacks.\u201cBrother Long, this time I\u2019ll definitely get it right!\u201d Seeing how unsightly Long Chen\u2019s face had become, Wilde hastily reassured him and prepared to lash the whip again.Just at this time, a figure appeared behind everyone. This person was in his thirties and had an exceptionally long blade scar on his face that made him appear extremely fierce.\u201cStay your hand!\u201d That man sternly shouted in fury when he saw the man lying on the floor with Wilde holding a whip in his raised hand.\u201cJust because you tell us to stop, we\u2019re supposed to stop? Hit him,\u201d ordered Long Chen coldly.Hearing Long Chen, Wilde no longer hesitated and sent another lash towards the man.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it!\u201d Seeing Wilde actually attack, he furiously stepped forward, his figure turning into a violent tempest that charged towards Wilde.\u201cGet lost!\u201dLong Chen also stepped forward, getting between them and punching out.Seeing Long Chen come forward to block him, he frowned and also sent out a punch.BOOM!The air exploded when the two fists met. But what shocked the scarred man was that his fist was actually completely unable to force back this frail and scholarly looking young man.At this time, Wilde\u2019s lash finally landed. Originally, he had been aiming for the man\u2019s buttocks, but due to his poor aim, it actually landed on his face.Furthermore, it ended up landing perfectly on the nose. Although Wilde didn\u2019t know how to use a whip, he still had quite a bit of physical strength. The man\u2019s nose immediately broke and blood spurted out.Seeing this, the scarred man turned ashen with anger. With a draconian shout, he unleashed his full power to force Long Chen back.Long Chen saw the situation and decided not to wait any longer. The FengFu Star on the bottom of his left foot shook and terrifying spiritual energy flooded out. He now used his full strength.The two of their fists offset each other, but the powerful energy was something the tiles on the floor were unable to bear and spiderweb cracks spread out.The scarred man\u2019s expression changed when he found out that Long Chen could still continue to block him when he used all his strength. Killing intent exploded out from him.His aura erupted from his body and a faint blood-colored qi could even be seen filling the air. His frightening energy caused even the atmosphere to become heavy. The others all had some trouble breathing.\u201cMid Blood Condensation realm?\u201dEveryone was astonished, as that level of Blood Qi was something that only mid Blood Condensation experts were capable of.Each major level of martial cultivation had nine minor levels that were split from the first Heavenstage to the ninth Heavenstage.First to third Heavenstages were early stage, fourth to sixth were mid stage, and seventh to ninth were late stage. As for the scarred man in front of them, now that all his strength had exploded out, everyone realized that he was a shocking mid Blood Condensation expert.BOOM! Long Chen felt his blood and qi billow, and he was forced back over three meters; his stomach started to ache.He had finally discovered his limit. This person in front of him was someone he was currently not a match for. Fear and shock filled him inside.As for that scarred man, he sent a fist flying towards Long Chen without hesitation.\u201cYou dare attack my brother Long!\u201dA thunderous roar shook everyone\u2019s ears suddenly, and a fist covered in blood-colored light smashed towards the scarred man with an immense power.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He actually managed to firmly stop the scarred man\u2019s punch.But although he blocked it, Wilde was still forced back several steps, and he would have fallen to the ground if Long Chen hadn\u2019t come to support him.The scarred man was surprised yet again. Both Long Chen and Wilde didn\u2019t have any obvious cultivation base, yet they were actually able to consecutively block him, a Blood Condensation expert. His shock quickly led to killing intent.Long Chen saw he had provoked the man\u2019s killing intent. His FengFu Star had yet to reach the level of complete condensation and so he was unable to handle him.The most important point was that although the scarred man had released his full strength, he had yet to consider them true opponents. From the beginning until now, he had yet to use any Battle Skills. He had clearly not unleashed his full attack potential on them.Long Chen didn\u2019t know what was happening with Wilde for him to suddenly become several times stronger, but even if the two of them joined hands, they would definitely not be able to block the scarred man\u2019s killer attacks.Long Chen stealthily rubbed his spatial ring. A fiery red medicinal pill appeared in his hand as he coldly looked at the scarred man.\u201cEveryone stop!\u201dJust as the scarred man was preparing to attack again, a cold shout rang out and a group of people appeared at the top floor of the restaurant.There were at least a dozen people, most wearing protective armor, but the two men at the front were wearing yellow imperial robes.\u201cGreetings to his highness the crown prince.\u201dEveryone was shocked and hastily knelt down when they saw that person.That person was the crown prince Chu Yang. He appeared to be twenty-seven years old, and with his square nose, he had a rather dignified and imposing air.The man beside him was slightly younger. He was pale and very handsome. However, he also gave people a very soft and gentle feeling.\u201cBrother Chu Yang, does your Phoenix Cry Empire treat its guest this way?\u201d gloomily asked that man.At this moment, Chu Yang\u2019s expression was slightly unsightly. Looking at the man with long eyebrows lying on the ground, he angrily demanded, \u201cWhat is going on here? Have you all gone blind? Do you not realize these are guests from the Grand Xia?\u201dChu Yang\u2019s gaze swept over all of them. Fatty Yu and the others\u2019 hearts were all pounding nervously, and sweat ran down their foreheads.They could tell that for that person to talk to the crown prince in such a way, in addition to his hair bun, he was most likely a prince of the Grand Xia.The Grand Xia was once mortal enemies with the Phoenix Cry Empire, but in the past few decades, their relations had mellowed and they had become allies.But the Grand Xia only had two princes, and they didn\u2019t know whether this person was the crown prince or the second prince.\u201cMy eyes haven\u2019t gone blind. This guy has blind dog eyes, so I just took the place of his master and taught him a little lesson.\u201d Long Chen walked forward indifferently.\u201cWho are you?\u201d The crown prince Chu Yang was irritated that a youth would dare speak to him in such a manner, but he was still calm and didn\u2019t immediately order his subordinates to capture him.\u201cLong Chen.\u201dIf he hadn\u2019t know Long Chen\u2019s name a month ago, he definitely knew it by now. There were few members in the upper class who had yet to hear of him.He was originally a trash cripple, but had now defeated a Qi Condensation expert on the martial arena twice in a row, and then somehow became a Pill Apprentice. There was a veil of mystery around him.\u201cWhy did you beat up crown prince Changfeng\u2019s bodyguard?\u201d Now that this matter involved the alchemist guild, even he, the crown prince, felt that it was extremely problematic.\u201cNo reason. I just felt that it was his fate today, so I helped the heavens send him on his way.\u201d Long Chen spread his hands.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Chu Yang exclaimed angrily. He had wanted Long Chen to give a reason, and then with a bit of his smoothing around and pointing out Long Chen\u2019s background with the alchemist guild, this matter would be resolved!But Long Chen acted like he hadn\u2019t understood anything and actually said such a line! His face turned green from rage.\u201cYou\u2019re called Long Chen? I think I\u2019ve heard of you. You seem to be pretty impressive these days?\u201d suddenly asked the Grand Xia\u2019s crown prince Xia Changfeng.\u201cHehe, I might be a bit impressive, but I pale in comparison to the people from your Grand Xia.\u201d Long Chen pointed to the man lying on the ground. \u201cWith a Magical Beast pulling a carriage, he went wild throughout the streets, barreling left and right without regard for other people. Now, that\u2019s really impressive. For a dog to be so impressive, I really can\u2019t imagine how impressive its master must be!\u201dXia Changfeng\u2019s expression immediately sunk. \u201cIs this true?\u201dLong Chen coldly snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. Ask your dog.\u201d\u201cLu Luo, did such a thing truly happen?\u201d Xia Changfeng\u2019s gaze turned ruthless, but he quickly pushed it down.\u201cMaster, I was rushing for time. Who knows why the lowly people here don\u2019t know how to get out of the way? It isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d The man with the long eyebrows had now recovered slightly, and he suppressed his pain to answer.\u201cIdiot, this isn\u2019t the Grand Xia. No one here recognizes our imperial carriages! Take him away.\u201d Xia Changfeng\u2019s face turned dark, and he cursed. Two men wearing the Grand Xia\u2019s clothes took the man away.He then turned towards Chu Yang and apologized, \u201cChangfeng was not strict enough with my people. Once I return, I will definitely properly discipline them to brother Chu Yang\u2019s satisfaction.\u201d\u201cHaha, brother Changfeng is too courteous. I just hope this small matter won\u2019t affect the relations between our two empires,\u201d hastily said Chu Yang.\u201cBrother Chu Yang worries too much. This matter will cease here.\u201d He then turned to Long Chen and said, \u201cMany thanks to little brother for warning me of this danger.\u201dEveryone stared blankly; no one had expected the crown prince of the Grand Xia to actually say such words and apologize to Long Chen. A feeling of admiration arose for him; this Grand Xia prince truly had an extraordinary bearing.If it weren\u2019t for Long Chen\u2019s powerful Spiritual Strength and perception, he might also think that way. But that killing intent Xia Changfeng had released towards him was not unnoticed or forgotten.\u201cPrince is too polite. For dogs to misbehave is common. You have to hold on to their leashes tightly; otherwise, they\u2019ll bite and claw others.\u201d Long Chen laughed and warned him cordially.Hearing this, the scarred man\u2019s expression darkened. Long Chen\u2019s usage of the word dog included not only him but also all the other imperial bodyguards.But Xia Changfeng only smiled slightly as if he hadn\u2019t understood his implicit meaning. \u201cWe just arrived at the capital, but all we\u2019ve heard about is what you\u2019ve done. I actually originally thought brother Long was just an alchemist, but it seems everyone was wrong. You dual cultivate martial arts and pill refining. Such battle strength is truly admirable. You are definitely at the peak amongst your generation.\u201dLong Chen only looked back at Xia Changfeng, momentarily not understanding what he meant by this. He only smiled slightly without offering a response.\u201cI wonder if brother Long would do me the honor of having a few drinks with me and brother Chu?\u201d asked Xia Changfeng.Although his smile was pleasant, Long Chen sensed that it was a smile that hid a poisonous fang, and he felt extremely uncomfortable with it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this little brother has drunk too much just now and can\u2019t bear any more. Otherwise, I also wouldn\u2019t have bothered with two dogs. This little one will take his leave.\u201dLong Chen smiled and seemingly without noticing Xia Changfeng\u2019s darkened expression or the scarred man\u2019s dense killing intent, he brought Wilde out.Once Long Chen left, Shi Feng and the others hastily apologized and ran, having experienced a great fright today.\u2026\u201cMaster, why didn\u2019t you let me kill that kid? Lu Luo\u2019s now is incapable of having any more children. That kid is too vicious.\u201dAt this time, the Grand Xia\u2019s prince had already returned to his residence, and the scarred man was speaking to him.\u201cThat little kid is someone from the alchemist guild. Although he\u2019s not from our country\u2019s guild, if you killed him like that, I would have to hand you over to the guild for punishment.\u201d\u201cBut that kid is completely wild. I just can\u2019t swallow this anger.\u201d To be repeatedly cursed as a dog, no one would be able to bear it.\u201cIf you want to kill him, you first have to come up with a plan. You have to make sure to kill that person while being sure you\u2019ll survive.\u201d Xia Changfeng shook his head.\u201cThen does that mean\u2026 you have a plan?\u201d asked the scarred man joyously.\u201cOf course, otherwise, would I act so kind to him? Every single person who ever gets to see me put on that kind face has died.\u201dXia Changfeng smiled a dark and profound smile. The scarred man couldn\u2019t help but shiver.\u201cDon\u2019t forget our goal in coming here. He\u2019s just a small matter. Let him live a few more days. The Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s largest festival, the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival, is about to arrive. That\u2019s the largest martial arts gathering of the year for Phoenix Cry. My praise today is not to be wasted. Hmph, once his popularity reaches its peak, challenge him at the Lantern Festival. At that time, would he be able to refuse?\u201d Xia Changfeng leaned back into his chair, his eyes half closed and a cold smile appearing on his mouth.Only now did the scarred man realize what a vicious trick this was. At that time, countless people would be watching. Long Chen couldn\u2019t refuse no matter how much he wanted to.If he dared to refuse, he would drown in ridicule, especially since he was so popular.\u201cHowever, be a bit more careful. As my imperial bodyguard, you can\u2019t reveal too much strength. Don\u2019t make me warn you again.\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry master. Over these years, I have never revealed my true hidden strength,\u201d replied the scarred man hastily.Xia Changfeng nodded, looking out into the night sky. His pupils were the exact same shade as the curtain of night, unfathomable.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 The Terrifying WildePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cWilde, what happened just now? Why did your power suddenly explode by so much?\u201dAs soon as they got home, Long Chen immediately asked Wilde about what had happened. At that time, Wilde had given even Long Chen an intimidating feeling.\u201cI don\u2019t know. When I saw that person was about to hit you, my head buzzed and my whole body became hot. It was like some inexhaustible energy was coming out of my body,\u201d described Wilde unsurely.Long Chen put his hand on Wilde\u2019s shoulder and used his exceptional Spiritual Strength to probe his body. But when it entered into his body, he found a completely shocking situation.Wilde\u2019s body was different from every other person. Most people had many winding meridians in their body.But Wilde only had four meridians. Those four meridians went from his Dantian to his four limbs. This was the first time Long Chen had ever encountered such a thing.Furthermore, the most surprising thing wasn\u2019t these strange meridians, but his physical body. A large majority of his cells had become closed off, appearing as if they were dead.But it wasn\u2019t a true death. Long Chen could sense that once heat passed over them, these cells that were in suspended animation would immediately swallow any cells that passed by them before returning to their state of fake death.Wilde truly was a strange being. Long Chen remained puzzled after considering hundreds of possibilities before he finally came to a certain theory.\u201cWilde, have you ever truly been full before?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cI eat till I\u2019m very full here,\u201d said Wilde.\u201cTell me the truth.\u201d\u201cUh, well just being half full is already enough for me.\u201d Wilde didn\u2019t dare hide the truth.\u201cWilde, remember. I\u2019m your brother Long. You can\u2019t tell me any more lies in the future. Otherwise, I\u2019ll get mad,\u201d Long Chen admonished seriously.\u201cBrother Long, I\u2026 I know.\u201d Seeing his severe expression, Wilde nervously agreed.\u201cLet me ask, what do you need to eat to feel more powerful?\u201d\u201cMeat.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of meat?\u201d\u201cAny meat. But beef is the best. I\u2019ve eaten a bit of it.\u201dLong Chen nodded. Wilde\u2019s special constitution had ninety-nine percent of his cells in a suspended animation state.That was because there wasn\u2019t enough energy to provide for them. To protect themselves, they had to enter such a state.Even with his Pill God memories, Long Chen had never seen such a strange body. Despite already having such a powerful body, only less than one percent of his cells were working.If all of his cells were activated, then just how terrifying would that be? Just thinking about that unnerved Long Chen. But Wilde was his own person, and the stronger he was, the better.\u201cHow much meat can you eat in one go?\u201d\u201cFive kilograms\u2026\u201d Wilde hesitated and he raised one finger.\u201cThe truth.\u201d\u201cA whole cow\u2026\u201d\u201cThe TRUTH.\u201d\u201cI can eat five cows\u2026\u201d\u201cTELL ME THE TRUTH!\u201d Long Chen\u2019s voice was now a shout.\u201cI don\u2019t know! But I think if I had ten cows that would be enough.\u201d Wilde had a somewhat bitter expression; he had never gotten to eat that much, so he himself didn\u2019t know how much he could eat.Long Chen shook his head, dumbfounded. \u201cOkay, tomorrow I\u2019ll go buy a whole pasture for you. You can eat as much as you want.\u201dThe next day, Long Chen told Bao-er to find pasture on the outskirts. The pasture wasn\u2019t very large, but there were over a thousand cows on it.Long Chen let Wilde go over, and the result was that the next day, everyone else working on the pasture ran away.They later came to Bao-er to report that Wilde was a savage. He would grab a cow and punch it to death, ripping off one of its legs and just start eating while it was still dripping with blood.All of them were trembling at the memory of it, afraid that Wilde might become interested in them and eat them.Long Chen had no other choice but to hire a dozen chefs that would regularly go over to cook for Wilde. Only then did Wilde get to eat cooked food.But what shocked Long Chen was that while Wilde could only eat ten cows on the first day, with each passing day, his appetite grew voraciously.Since each cow was only two or three gold coins, Long Chen wasn\u2019t worried about being eaten into poverty. In fact, he delighted in what was happening.The fact that Wilde\u2019s appetite was growing was a sign that his cells had started to gradually awaken. Once all his cells had awoken, Wilde would be completely transformed.After resolving Wilde\u2019s affairs, Long Chen entered his own seclusion. That battle with the scarred man had given him an extremely great sense of crisis.His feeling from that day was that the scarred man had still been holding back. Although he was not a threat for the moment, Long Chen still felt that this matter would not be resolved so simply.After merging with the Pill God\u2019s soul, his ability to sense danger had become increasingly great. Last time, his opponent hadn\u2019t been properly prepared.Once his opponent was prepared, Long Chen might really be doomed to die. But he still didn\u2019t regret it.Even if he was given another chance, he still would have handled things the same way. Otherwise, that lash Wilde had received would stay forever in his heart. The heart could not be allowed to have imperfections, or it would eventually become a heart-devil.Long Chen entered his seclusion in great determination this time, and he began to wildly absorb the FengFu Pills. Seven days later, the FengFu Star at the bottom of his foot finally emitted an exploding sound.The FengFu Star had greatly changed under Long Chen\u2019s absorption of endless medicinal energy.The smooth outer shell was shed, and what shocked Long Chen was that the inside appeared to be a star.But this star was somewhat indistinct. It was filled with the rhythm of life though, a shocking state.That was the first star of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, the FengFu Star. The current Long Chen was no longer able to sense just what level of power he was at, and he was filled with shock.BOOM!The FengFu Star that was shedding its outer layer suddenly shook, and a terrifying energy caused even the room to shudder.\u201cCrap, what a huge movement!\u201dDespite being worried, it was too late for Long Chen to do anything. The entire room blew apart like paper.At the same time, the energy of heaven and earth underwent a huge shock and wildly surged towards Long Chen.BANG!Long Chen spat out a mouthful of blood. His body felt like it was on the verge of exploding, and he fainted.When Long Chen came to his senses, he saw his mother worriedly examining him. Seeing he had awoken, she was both alarmed and happy.\u201cChen-er, you scared your mom! What were you doing?\u201dLong Chen quickly replied, \u201cMom, it\u2019s nothing too big. A furnace explosion is normal when refining pills.\u201dHe could only use a furnace explosion as an excuse. It was not easy to reassure his mother, but once he had, he used his divine sense to examine his insides, almost letting out a shocked exclamation.He had somehow gained a Dantian! The originally empty spot now held three cyclones that were slowly revolving.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dNoticing that the FengFu Star on the bottom of his foot was still there, he relaxed quite a bit. But seeing those three cyclones in his Dantian still gave him a pause.When his personal Spirit Root had been extracted, his Dantian had turned into a land of nothing but death. That was something that could not be recovered from. Unless\u2026Did this mean that after condensing the FengFu Star, the Dantian would be reconstructed?Thinking back to what had happened just before he had fainted, he knew that the terrifying energy from heaven and earth that had surged into him was something that no ordinary person could endure.That energy had been crazily berserk; it was not something people could use. Could it mean that that energy had been used to destroy the original Dantian and then build a new one in its place?But in truth, Long Chen was wrong. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was an existence even more terrifying than he imagined. If he had actually had a Dantian at that time, then he would already be dead.Although Long Chen couldn\u2019t figure it out, he continued to examine the changes and found out that he could actually interact with the three cyclones in his Dantian.\u201cDid I really reconstruct a Dantian?\u201dLong Chen tried to pull the energy within the cyclones to the rest of his body and found out that there was not the slightest obstruction. He was easily able to use that energy.With a stamp of his foot, the FengFu Star\u2019s energy also flowed out without the slightest pause. Long Chen was completely befuddled; what was the meaning of this? Was it just to gain another reserve of spiritual qi?With a simple thought, Long Chen drew the FengFu Star\u2019s energy into his Dantian.He immediately felt as if a volcano was exploding within him. The terrifying energy was like a tsunami bursting forth. A mouthful of blood was quickly spat out by him, and he almost fainted again.Long Chen laid on the ground wildly gasping for air, filled with shock and terror. Even his internal organs had been shaken and torn.Quickly swallowing a healing pill, the medicinal energy enveloped his body. Long Chen\u2019s pale face gradually returned to normal.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Long Chen angrily snarled inside. Just now he had almost killed himself. That really would have been ridiculous.But he had no answer. In terms of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, all that he had in his memories was how to cultivate in it; all other informations about it was gone.There were no ranks, no origins, and no means of using it. In a sense, its defects were quite similar to his.Long Chen smiled bitterly. He had no Spirit Root, no Spirit Bone, and no Spirit Blood. These three things had all been snatched away, so he supposed he was quite suited to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.But if he couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on after such a strange event, Long Chen would not be able to stomach it. Grinding his teeth, he continued his interact with his FengFu Star.This time Long Chen knew not to use such a large amount of it. He slowly drew a tiny amount, bit by bit.BOOM!When that slightest bit of energy entered his Dantian, Long Chen clearly sensed the three cyclones become ten times larger in an instant.Most shocking of all was when that slightest bit of FengFu Star\u2019s energy entered, they went from slowly revolving to crazily spinning.Following the wild revolving of the three cyclones, endless energy immediately flowed out to all of Long Chen\u2019s body, filling him with power.Long Chen had finally figured out one of the secrets of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. It really was too shocking and too frightening. Even Long Chen himself was a bit terrified.\u201cIs this what the nine star transformations in my memories mean? The three cyclones in my Dantian, do they indicate three transformations?\u201dOnly after a long time did Long Chen slowly calm his thoughts down. Since he had three cyclones now, then according to the rest of the world\u2019s tiers, he would be a weak beginner at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.But as for whether he truly was weak, that was something only Long Chen knew. This discovery filled him with both shock and excitement. With a touch of his spatial ring, an ancient beast hide appeared in his hand. That was what he had gained in exchange for bribing a Blood Condensation expert.\u201cSplit the Heavens, Split the Heavens\u2026 hehe, let me see just what secrets are hidden within you.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These nine dots didn\u2019t have the slightest pattern.There were no explanations, but this time, Long Chen carefully examined them and found that there really was an extremely faint line connecting them.\u201cThese should be nine acupuncture points.\u201dLong Chen had to look at them for a great deal of time before coming to this conclusion. Within Long Chen\u2019s mind was a map of countless meridians, and only after going down each and every single one of them did he come to such a conclusion. Other people might think about it until they died before figuring it out.\u201cEnter LiYao, merge into HuiMing\u2026 rush into QuChi, join LaoGong?\u201d[1]Long Chen quietly whispered the names of the nine points as he followed along their meridian paths. He paused, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fist or palm technique, but a weapon Battle Skill.\u201d\u201cWhat a brilliant technique.\u201dLong Chen studied it and found that when qi flowed through these nine spots, it was as if a dammed river had burst forth. After passing through nine turns, it would definitely be terrifying to the extreme when released.He had definitely gained a treasure this time, and although Long Chen didn\u2019t know what class it was, it was definitely not low.Under his urging, his Dantian\u2019s qi flowed out towards the LiYao point, but when he tried to urge his spiritual energy to the second acupuncture point, he found out that he was unable to continue.\u201cHuh?\u201dAfter a brief pause, Long Chen understood that this technique must have very high requirements in terms of spiritual energy. Without enough spiritual energy, it was impossible to use it.Giving up on his Dantian\u2019s spiritual energy, he started to use his FengFu Star. As he expected, his FengFu Star was filled with much more power than his Dantian.But when he arrived at the fourth acupuncture point, he began to stall. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to reach the sixth point.\u201cI don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t do this!\u201dLong Chen clenched his jaw and sent a strand of spiritual energy from his FengFu Star into his Dantian\u2019s cyclones. The cyclones immediately released a wild energy.Controlling that energy, he quickly progressed.The sixth\u2026The seventh\u2026The eighth\u2026\u201cCrap\u2026\u201dLong Chen suddenly stopped and hastily recalled his spiritual energy. Using his divine sense, he examined his meridians.He was shocked to find that his meridians were already starting to break down from that terrifying energy, and tears had started to appear. If Long Chen had been a step too late in recalling his spiritual energy, his meridians would have completely exploded.If the meridians really did explode, then it would require an extremely long time to recover. Sweat dripped down his back from fear.\u201cCrap, I can\u2019t train in this for now.\u201d Long Chen could only unwillingly give up on practicing Split the Heavens.Swallowing a meridian nourishing pill, he quickly restored his slightly damaged meridians. Long Chen stood up and walked out.Opening the door, he took a deep breath of fresh air, recovering from his fatigue from his continuous training.At this time, the sun had just started to rise in the east. Long Chen made some inquiries for Bao-er. Their estate was completely fine. Wilde was also completely fine and eating till he was full every day.This let Long Chen relax. He changed his clothes and prepared to go to the alchemist guild to request help from grandmaster Yun Qi.But Long Chen was somewhat nervous. Ordinary alchemists focused on cultivating the Pill Flame and didn\u2019t split their attention to Battle Skills. This was to concentrate all of one\u2019s energy and effort, so that one could travel further on the pill path.Alchemists were normally completely arrogant and didn\u2019t care to bother with martial cultivation. That was also what grandmaster Yun Qi had reminded Long Chen of that day.But Long Chen had his own thoughts on the subject. He had been bullied for too long, and without powerful martial strength, he simply didn\u2019t feel safe.No matter what status or position, it was all nothing to Long Chen. In the face of true power, such things were as weak as a piece of paper.Long Chen didn\u2019t know just how grandmaster Yun Qi would react when he saw him.\u201cLong Chen!\u201d Long Chen had already walked several blocks in his nervousness when suddenly warm shout rang out. Turning his head, he saw a carriage had stopped in the distance.Opening the cover was a young woman who happily looked at Long Chen. It was the imperial princess Chu Yao.\u201cChu Yao.\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help being a bit alarmed to see Chu Yao, but for some reason, after a moment of looking at her, most of his anxiousness disappeared.Chu Yao looked around. Seeing that no one was around due to how early it was, she beckoned. \u201cQuick, get in.\u201dLong Chen hadn\u2019t expected Chu Yao to actually invite him to share a carriage. Seeing her bright smile, Long Chen\u2019s heart jumped slightly and he leaped onto the carriage.The inside of the carriage was exceptionally spacious. Other than a bed, it also had a tea table with blankets laid out.\u201cHow coincidental to see you here. How about you come with me to Sunset Mountain?\u201dChu Yao\u2019s pretty gaze at Long Chen was filled with joy, a complete opposite to her original ruthless and crafty one when she had first captured him.\u201cWith such a beautiful woman inviting me, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d be struck by heavenly lightning if I refused,\u201d laughed Long Chen.Chu Yao\u2019s charming face reddened; within the palace, she had many rules and restrictions she had to follow. She truly enjoyed Long Chen\u2019s carefree and unfettered way of talking.The carriage slowly left the city towards Sunset Mountain.\u201cChu Yao, why are you going to Sunset Mountain?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cI\u2026 I just want to play around.\u201d For some reason, Chu Yao\u2019s face became extremely red, confusing Long Chen.\u201cI\u2019m not taking you away from something important am I?\u201d probed Chu Yao.\u201cMe? I just came out for a stroll. For me to coincide with your carriage and come out to have fun is perfect,\u201d smiled Long Chen. \u201cRight, is your little brother fine? I really am sorry about what happened last time.\u201d Long Chen still felt a bit embarrassed about what had happened with the seventh prince.\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Scaring him a bit is good too; it\u2019ll keep him better behaved,\u201d laughed Chu Yao.In just a short time, they arrived at the foot of Sunset Mountain. Chu Yao got off and ordered her bodyguard to drive the carriage back.\u201cAccompany me. I really like the scenery around here.\u201d Chu Yao pointed to the small path in front of them. \u201cWhen I was young, I frequently came here to climb this mountain. But ever since my father entered seclusion, I haven\u2019t had many such opportunities.\u201dA pitiful trace of loneliness appeared on her face when she said this. Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but sigh. No matter where you were born, there was always much to be desired.\u201cLong Chen, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chu Yao asked when she saw that Long Chen seemed moody.His heart warmed due to Chu Yao\u2019s concern. He didn\u2019t know why, but although he had only met Chu Yao once, he still felt a complicated emotion upon seeing her. Perhaps, it stemmed from not knowing if she was an enemy.But she gave him a very trustworthy feeling that he couldn\u2019t explain.\u201cI did run into a bit of trouble recently. I was hoping to cultivate a higher grade Battle Skill.\u201d\u201cIf you want to cultivate Battle Skills, then just come to find me. I won\u2019t even charge tuition fees,\u201d joked Chu Yao, her eyes brightening. \u201cI\u2019m already proficient in thirty types of Battle Skills. They say that I\u2019m a peak talent.\u201dProficient in thirty Battle Skills? And then using only one attack the same way over and over again? Long Chen couldn\u2019t help being a bit doubtful.\u201cHey, what kind of look is that! You doubt me?\u201d A hint of anger appeared on Chu Yao\u2019s face.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t doubt you. I don\u2019t believe it at all!\u201d joked Long Chen.\u201cYou scoundrel, look!\u201d With a cute cry, Chu Yao sent a palm towards Long Chen.Chu Yao\u2019s palm landed on Long Chen\u2019s stomach. Although she hadn\u2019t used any spiritual energy, the force behind it wasn\u2019t small. When it landed on his body, it still emitted a loud bang.\u201cYou\u2026 why didn\u2019t you dodge?\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected him to just take the blow.\u201cIf I dodged, you wouldn\u2019t have hit me. That\u2019d be boring,\u201d laughed Long Chen. Although the hand was separated from him with a layer of clothing, he could still feel a peculiar feeling from it.\u201cLong Chen\u2026\u201dSeeing his straightforward smile, she felt a burst of warmth. She actually gently laid her head on Long Chen\u2019s chest.Long Chen\u2019s body immediately went rigid. What kind of situation was this? Long Chen didn\u2019t dare move an inch, turning into a stump of wood.Chu Yao\u2019s face suddenly turned warm, and seeing his nervous expression, she covered a smile. \u201cYou bad person, back then when you were fighting, you were like a tiger baring its fangs. How come you\u2019ve become a little kitten now?\u201dLong Chen immediately felt awkward and changed the subject, \u201cChu Yao, I don\u2019t want to treat you like a stranger. I really do feel that you need to learn a few higher grade Battle Skills.\u201dChu Yao\u2019s face reddened, and she blankly stared at Long Chen. If he didn\u2019t want to treat her as a stranger, then what did he want to treat her as? She clearly had misunderstood Long Chen\u2019s meaning.But in response to Long Chen\u2019s seriousness, Chu Yao was also resolute. \u201cI wasn\u2019t joking. I really am proficient in many Battle Skills. Look.\u201dShe extended a hand and a scorching air rose out. A faint red light appeared over her hand.She sent her palm into a tree over a foot thick and it trembled, its leaves flying. When she removed her palm, a faint handprint could be seen on it.\u201cDid you see? This is a high Mortal class Battle Skill, Flamecloud Palm. How is it? Are you scared?\u201dChu Yao was pleased with Long Chen\u2019s stupefied expression.Long Chen truly was shocked. This kind of power could still be considered a Battle Skill? Even without a Battle Skill, Long Chen could easily topple such a tree in one blow.\u201cUh-huh, it really was good to look at,\u201d quickly replied Long Chen. Chu Yao\u2019s movements had been very fluid and smooth, which really was pleasing to look at.Chu Yao didn\u2019t appear to catch his other meaning and thought that he meant she had shocked him. She very patiently explained to Long Chen the main points of her attack.But when Long Chen heard her explanation on how to use the Flamecloud Palm, Long Chen was truly shocked. Based on what she said, then in theory, it was clearly an extremely powerful palm technique!\u201cLet me try it.\u201d\u201cSo quickly?\u201d Chu Yao asked in disbelief.Long Chen smiled slightly. Battle Skills were just a way to use spiritual energy. Through the superposition within the meridians, they could emit a powerful strength, that was all.Long Chen was already as familiar as possible with his body\u2019s meridians, so hearing her explain it once was enough for him.His Dantian\u2019s spiritual energy circulated and a dense fiery energy erupted out. Long Chen shouted out and sent a palm crashing forward.BOOM!A huge tree, which would require several people to wrap around it, snapped, its crown whistling as it fell.The huge tree smashed into the ground, sending dirt flying. Chu Yao was staring blankly; was this really the same Flamecloud Palm as hers?The spot where the tree had broken was completely scorched, a specific mark of the Flamecloud Palm. Long Chen nodded inside; it truly was worthy of being a high Mortal class Battle Skill. Its power was extremely great.But seeing Chu Yao beside him filled with shock, Long Chen\u2019s heart shook and he grabbed Chu Yao\u2019s hand.\u201cChu Yao, let me examine your body.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She secretly glanced at Long Chen and realized that he was actually a bit puzzled.When Long Chen glanced up at Chu Yao\u2019s face, he momentarily forgot what he was doing. She was like a blooming flower with eyes like sparkling jewels, and it was simply impossible not to be moved by her beauty.\u201cCough.\u201d Chu Yao became even redder when Long Chen just foolishly looked at her. But within her beautiful eyes was happiness as well. With a cough, she turned her head down and didn\u2019t dare to look at Long Chen again. Only the gentle warmth transmitted from his hand continued to warm her heart.Taking a deep breath, Long Chen calmed himself back down. She had an air of being too high to reach, and yet, also a contradicting gentle softness of a woman.The Chu Yao who had arrogantly captured him in a net and the current gentle and shy Chu Yao were completely different.Suppressing his wildly jumping heart, Long Chen used his Spiritual Strength to follow along the meridians within Chu Yao\u2019s hand and slowly enter into her Dantian.Actually, with Long Chen\u2019s strength, at such proximity, it was entirely possible for him to examine Chu Yao without touching her.But doing so would mean that Chu Yao would be essentially naked in front of Long Chen. Maybe Long Chen wasn\u2019t so against that, but he was afraid that afterward, she might once again capture him inside a net.Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength gently entered into her Dantian. But when he saw what was going on, even with his self-control, he couldn\u2019t help having his expression turn ugly.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Chu Yao was alarmed at his dark gaze.Long Chen\u2019s anger was due to the fact that nine types of foreign spiritual energy were currently locked and fixed within her Dantian.Those nine foreign spiritual energies were like nine saplings planted into a fertile farm; they were incessantly absorbing Chu Yao\u2019s spiritual energy away, leaving her with only a fraction for her own use.No wonder her spiritual energy was so frail and disorderly! So she was just like Long Chen and had been schemed against by others.Even more infuriating was that there was a Spirit Root that released a dense qi. Although he wasn\u2019t sure what level she was at, Long Chen knew she was definitely a rare genius seen only once in a thousand years.Such a genius had been wasted away like this. But just this wouldn\u2019t have aroused Long Chen\u2019s killing intent.Long Chen had found that those nine foreign spiritual energies were following along her Spirit Root, and in the future, when she married and lost her virginity, the spiritual energy that had been absorbed by them for years would be silently snatched away!That was the most hateful thing. A princess of this generation, a beauty that could topple cities, had been used by someone as a chess piece. This was clearly the result of some sort of scheme.And as for Chu Yao, she didn\u2019t seem to know anything about it! Long Chen couldn\u2019t help feeling empathy for this beautiful woman.\u201cLong Chen, what\u2019s going on?\u201d His expression was complicated, and Chu Yao was somewhat alarmed by it.\u201cChu Yao, do you trust me?\u201d Long Chen hesitated for a moment before solemnly asking her this.Seeing his extremely serious manner, Chu Yao also sensed something. But she didn\u2019t hesitate. Looking Long Chen in the eyes, she said, \u201cYou are the person I trust the most.\u201dLong Chen heart warmed. \u201cYour Dantian has been altered by others.\u201dBut what surprised Long Chen was that Chu Yao didn\u2019t have that great of a reaction. Helplessness appeared in her sad eyes.Looking at the distant mountain peaks, her jade hands gently brushed back her hair that was blown wild by the wind. She quietly said, \u201cIf you say this secret out loud, you might be implicated with the people from my family. Are you not afraid?\u201d\u201cYou already knew?\u201d\u201cCan you answer me first?\u201d asked Chu Yao.Long Chen bitterly smiled. \u201cSince we\u2019ve chosen to trust each other, then even if I were to lose my life, it would be worth it.\u201d\u201cTrust? Trust?\u201dChu Yao mumbled that word over and over. She suddenly threw herself at Long Chen\u2019s chest and began to weep loudly. Her tears flowed out as if a dam had been broken, as if she wanted all her grievances to be swept away.Despite having such a beautiful woman in his arms, Long Chen didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of being charming. Instead, his heart was also filled with a kind of mourning.Long Chen had been even worse off than Chu Yao. His Spirit Root, Spirit Bone, and Spirit Blood had all been stolen. If he hadn\u2019t suddenly fused with a Pill God\u2019s soul, he would perhaps still be completely in the dark.At some point, his arms had wrapped around her slender waist and tightly hugged her. Smelling the scent of her hair, it felt as if they were the last two people on earth.After crying for forever, Chu Yao finally stopped her sobbing. Long Chen\u2019s chest was already completely wet from her tears.Her face suddenly turned completely red, and she quickly escaped Long Chen\u2019s embrace. She turned away from him, but inside, she was filled with both happiness and hesitation.Long Chen awkwardly coughed and asked, \u201cChu Yao, when did you learn that your Dantian had been tampered with?\u201dChu Yao slowly recovered herself and turned back to look at him. \u201cWhen I was young and before my father, the emperor, entered seclusion, he told me I was this generation\u2019s martial cultivation genius and might even be able to ascend beyond the empire. Before he entered seclusion, I was greatly encouraged to cultivate, and I truly did work hard at the beginning. But when I turned ten, my mother suddenly became sick. She turned gravely ill, and before we could even invite grandmaster Yun Qi, she had already left this world.\u201dArriving at this point in her story, her tears once more began to slowly flow out. She seemed to have sunk back into her memories of that time.\u201cAt that time, my little brother and I were still young. But as we grew older, we gradually learned about the palace\u2019s internal struggles. I realized my mother\u2019s death was definitely no accident. But all the evidence had long since disappeared. I was powerless. Then, five years ago, my cultivation base ceased to progress. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to advance a single step, and my spiritual energy became weaker and weaker. At that time, I realized that the villain who had killed my mother had finally stretched his hand towards me and my brother. From that day onwards, my brother and I started to act bossy and arrogant. We started making headstrong, rash decisions, and from that time, it seems as if everything went back to normal.\u201dLong Chen felt completely helpless as he listened to her story. The palace\u2019s internal affairs were even crueler than what he had imagined.\u201cYou used such a method to protect you and your brother?\u201d sighed Long Chen.Chu Yao nodded. \u201cThe only family I have left right now is my little brother. I just hope he can stay alive. Although having him to act this way is annoying, at least no one will menace him, so it should be a bit safer. Although I don\u2019t know what they did to my Dantian, I know they were afraid I would be a threat to them, and so they restricted my cultivation. Thus, as long as I don\u2019t have the heart to cultivate, no one will have any plans against a weak girl like me. My brother and I also will be able to live without worry.\u201dLong Chen sighed, \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve underestimated your enemy\u2019s viciousness. Whoever did this was an absolute bastard.\u201dHesitating for a moment, Long Chen still decided to tell Chu Yao the situation within her Dantian. Hearing this, anger and indecisiveness flared in her eyes. Her face turned pale and her body shook.Long Chen supported Chu Yao, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be too worried. Give me some time, and I can unlock the seal within your body.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Chu Yao couldn\u2019t believe this.\u201cReally,\u201d promised Long Chen.For some reason, when Chu Yao looked at Long Chen, she was filled with trust. It was a kind of indescribable feeling.He gave her a sense of complete safety. This kind of feeling was extremely precious and rare within the palace that was full of hidden schemes.Seeing that she didn\u2019t have any hesitation or doubt in him, Long Chen sighed, feeling as if another burden had been placed on his shoulders.\u201cOh beautiful Chu Yao, can you display some of your magnificent skills for me again? Let this little one study a bit.\u201d Long Chen found that the atmosphere had become a bit depressed, so he joked a bit.\u201cScoundrel, you\u2019re clearly mocking me,\u201d she rebuked.\u201cOh heavens no, your foundation is extremely strong. It\u2019s just that your Dantian is unable to release enough force. But don\u2019t worry. In just a short time, I\u2019ll help you resolve it,\u201d consoled Long Chen.Only when she judged Long Chen\u2019s words to be sincere did she once more display a high Mortal class Battle Skill - Breaking Wind Fist.Long Chen carefully examined her this time, and couldn\u2019t help but to feel some shock. Her spiritual energy was constantly being sucked away by those nine spiritual energies, leaving her with perhaps a tenth of the energy.But even with such a frail energy, Chu Yao\u2019s display was completely perfect without the slightest energy wasted.He realized her control with spiritual energy had reached an extremely high level. It was much greater than even Blood Condensation experts.He was not at all miserly with his praise of her, causing her to happily blush.The nine foreign spiritual energies were actually seeds of spiritual energy. After having absorbed her spiritual energy for so many years, they had already become very powerful.Long Chen felt that if he were to just break them, it would be too wasteful. That kind of huge energy was enough to allow Chu Yao to break through to the Blood Condensation realm, and her cultivation base would continue climbing after.After learning the Breaking Wind Fist, he suddenly took out a bottle of medicinal liquid. \u201cThis is Face Changing Liquid; once you apply it to your face, it will change your appearance for twenty-four hours. It\u2019s very convenient.\u201dHe poured out a few drops and rubbed it over his face. In just an instant, he appeared to become a completely different person, his eyebrows becoming thicker and his skin changing shade.Chu Yao exclaimed, \u201cThen in the future, I can change my appearance and come out to find you!\u201dShe then also applied it over her face. The medicinal liquid became a thin layer over the face that could be changed at will for a while. Once no more changes were made to it, it would completely set in just a few breaths\u2019 time.Looking into her mirror and seeing that her face had become extremely ordinary, she couldn\u2019t help jumping in joy.Pulling Long Chen\u2019s arm, she happily said, \u201cLong Chen, let\u2019s go stroll the streets. I\u2019ve never been allowed to just walk along the streets.\u201dAmongst princesses, she was one of those unruly types, but she still wouldn\u2019t go too far. She normally couldn\u2019t act like the ordinary poor people and just go as she pleased. So, she naturally couldn\u2019t let go of this chance Long Chen had given her.Chu Yao intimately held onto his arm. Seeing her excited manner, it would be a lie to say Long Chen wasn\u2019t moved. He straightaway agreed to go with her.But after agreeing, Long Chen started to regret it. He had clearly underestimated Chu Yao\u2019s desire to stroll the streets.She practically pulled him through every small alley within the capital. She wanted to see everything and anything, and she even shot question after question to him.He was quite happy to just smell her scent and feel the joy of her hand wrapped around his arm, but suddenly he stopped, bringing Chu Yao to a small vendor to the side.Long Chen struck up a fake conversation with the vendor about his wares, but his gaze narrowed towards several people in the distance.\u201cXia Changfeng?\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 Long Chens ShockPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeThere were around seven or eight people in that group, and Long Chen could clearly see that the Grand Xia\u2019s prince Xia Changfeng was amongst them. But what shocked Long Chen the most was that familiar face beside him.That woman was very slender and fair, but her face always had a faint arrogance on it. It was the crazy woman Long Chen had encountered at the alchemist guild.Why was she there? And why did she seem so familiar with the Grand Xia\u2019s prince? Long Chen simply couldn\u2019t figure it out.Their group entered an expensive teahouse just after he noticed them.\u201cOne of those people is the fourth prince.\u201d Chu Yao warned Long Chen as she had also seen those people.\u201cThe fourth prince?\u201d He was supposed to be the most low-key prince. He never participated in the internal fights of the princes. But then why was he with the Grand Xia\u2019s prince?\u201cHe has also changed his appearance, but his finger has a ring mark on it that he forgot to hide. He normally wears a dragon ring with a very distinctive pattern, so I easily recognize it,\u201d said Chu Yao.As a princess, she might have to act arrogant every day, but she was also very perceptive to the everyday habits of each prince; thus, she was easily able to see through the fourth prince\u2019s disguise.Long Chen felt a headache coming. Why would the fourth prince disguise himself? He wanted to sneak in and use his divine sense to secretly eavesdrop.However, the door was guarded by a dozen of the Grand Xia\u2019s elite troops. Doing so would simply be too difficult. It was in the middle of the day, and trying to sneak in would be basically impossible. He gave up on that idea.\u201cChu Yao, I\u2019m going to go back and prepare some ingredients that will resolve the foreign spiritual energies in your Dantain,\u201d said Long Chen.Despite being reluctant to part, she still obediently nodded her head.Long Chen went directly home. As soon as he walked past the gate, a happy shout rang out.\u201cBrother Long!\u201dWilde was a small giant now, and he excitedly looked at Long Chen.The current Wilde had become much livelier, and the thing that pleased Long Chen the most was that he was no longer as thin as he had been before.His bare arms were clearly bigger, and some indistinct veins could be seen beneath the skin.\u201cHaha, have you been eating properly Wilde?\u201d Long Chen patted his sturdy arm.\u201cBrother Long, I eat till I\u2019m full every day. I feel like I\u2019ve become very strong now; thus, I want to be with brother Long so that I can protect you.\u201d Wilde slapped his chest confidently, emitting a sound like a thunderous drum.Long Chen nodded and brought Wilde into his own room. He then used his divine sense to examine Wilde\u2019s body.\u201cWhat?!\u201dDespite nourishing them all this time and feeding them so much, still less than ten percent of Wilde\u2019s cells were active.And when he examined his four meridians, he noticed they had expanded a little. But most shocking of all was that there was what seemed to be a trace of spiritual qi within his Dantian.\u201cYou learned how to cultivate?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cBrother Long, what is this \u2018cultivating\u2019?\u201d asked Wilde with wide eyes.\u201cUh, nevermind.\u201dLong Chen also didn\u2019t feel like trying to explain such a thing. Continuing his examination, he noticed that Wilde\u2019s Dantian was deathly still, but there was still a steady flow of the world\u2019s spiritual qi that was flowing into his Dantian.\u201cWhat an abnormal constitution; even without cultivating, it just automatically absorbs energy on its own.\u201dLong Chen sucked in a breath of cold air; this was something he had never encountered before. Wilde\u2019s Dantian held a huge amount of spiritual qi, which meant that once his body was strong enough, he would be able to automatically absorb spiritual qi from heaven and earth to use.If other martial artists were to learn of this, they would definitely go crazy. This meant that even when Wilde was sleeping or eating, he would still be incessantly cultivating.\u201cWilde, I\u2019m going to teach you a few simple cultivation methods and how to use your Dantian\u2019s qi.\u201dDue to how unique Wilde\u2019s Dantian was, Long Chen decided not to teach him any Battle Skills. Wilde only had four meridians, which meant that he wouldn\u2019t be able to use any Battle Skills for now.So Long Chen only taught him how to circulate his spiritual qi to his arms and legs, passively increasing their strength.But Long Chen had still overestimated Wilde\u2019s ability comprehension skills. Even something as simple as linking to his Dantian required six hours of Long Chen\u2019s time to explain. Despite having Long Chen\u2019s throat turn raw, Wilde was still mystified.Long Chen knew he couldn\u2019t get angry. Wilde was listening to him completely innocently, so his belly full of anger was never released.\u201cOkay, how about this. Until you learn this, I\u2019ll work you to death.\u201d Long Chen helplessly sighed.\u201cI\u2019m sorry brother Long, I\u2019m just too stupid. I could spend a lifetime without figuring this out.\u201d Wilde dejectedly hung his head.Wilde truly was too incompetent; he was unable to immerse himself even slightly within his Dantian. He couldn\u2019t even find where his Dantian was.Long Chen was unwilling to resign himself to this result. Wilde\u2019s physique was so powerful that it was frightening. If he had the assistance of his spiritual qi, the power which he could explode out with would be absolutely terrifying.Long Chen felt that it was such a waste. He felt like a beggar who had a mountain of gold, yet still relied on begging to pass each day.Suddenly, Long Chen\u2019s eyes brightened. Placing his hand on Wilde\u2019s back, he said, \u201cLet me help you find your Dantian.\u201dHis Spiritual Strength poured into Wilde\u2019s Dantian. Since Wilde trusted Long Chen completely, there wasn\u2019t the slightest resistance. Long Chen easily merged his Spiritual Strength into Wilde\u2019s Dantian.Furthermore, even if Wilde had wanted to resist, he didn\u2019t know how to. But at least now Wilde had found the position of his Dantian.\u201cNow that you\u2019ve found your Dantian, the next step is to immerse into it.\u201d\u201cImmerse?\u201d\u201cUse your intent to hook yourself into your Dantian.\u201d\u201cIntent?\u201dLong Chen sighed. But he still patiently controlled his temper. \u201cFocus your entire mind onto your Dantian.\u201d\u201cOh, then what?\u201d\u201cTry to make it revolve.\u201d\u201cClockwise or counterclockwise?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLong Chen was practically speechless. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. As long as it circulates, it\u2019s fine.\u201dNow that he had found its position, Wilde slowly tried to control his Dantian. However, it was as if the Dantian weren\u2019t even his and he was unable to move it at all.\u201cYou\u2019re not focused enough. Close your eyes and try again.\u201dFinally, under Long Chen\u2019s great expectations, Wilde\u2019s Dantian moved slightly. Although doing just that wasn\u2019t exactly using his Dantian, at least, he had found it and opened the path. Long Chen relaxed slightly.\u201cGood, next I\u2019ll use my Spiritual Strength to guide your Dantian\u2019s qi for one cycle. Remember how I\u2019m doing this.\u201dAfter saying this, Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength circulated into Wilde\u2019s Dantian. When Wilde\u2019s Dantian felt Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength, it was as if it had been provoked and it immediately exploded out.The originally completely calm Dantian immediately was like an erupting volcano, like angry waves trying to swallow the sky.\u201cWilde, can you control your Dantian?\u201d Long Chen started to celebrate, but\u2026\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Wilde was completely shocked at the uprising of the spiritual qi within him.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, remember the path I\u2019m taking.\u201dLong Chen didn\u2019t feel like telling him the position of each one of his acupuncture points. He wouldn\u2019t be able to remember them anyways, so he skipped that. Having him remember the feeling of where they were was good enough.Long Chen used his Spiritual Strength to draw Wilde\u2019s Dantian\u2019s qi into his arm. Long Chen wanted to go slowly and circulate it.How could he have predicted that as soon as Wilde\u2019s qi reached his arm, it became like a wild horse and refused to be controlled by Long Chen anymore? Wild energy surged out.Wilde felt a great power pass through his arm, so he instinctively punched out.BOOM!!!The entire roof was shaken into pieces; smoke and dust exploded out, revealing the starry sky above.\u201cWhat a berserk energy!\u201dLong Chen was extremely alarmed. All this had just been caused by the wind from Wilde\u2019s fist, but it was already so frightening! If someone was hit by the actual fist, wouldn\u2019t they be smashed into pulp?Wilde was also stupefied at his own power. He had never thought he would have such strength.Long Chen once more examined Wilde\u2019s Dantian and found that the spiritual qi within had basically all been depleted.\u201cWilde, go back and rest. Remember what I\u2019ve taught you and train every day. Don\u2019t goof off,\u201d ordered Long Chen solemnly.Wilde\u2019s comprehension skills were already extremely low. If he was lazy as well, then even a divine immortal would be unable to teach him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry brother Long, I\u2019ll train like my life depends on it!\u201d Wilde was filled with excitement now.After Wilde left, Long Chen speechlessly looked at the roofless room. Just what secret was hidden within Wilde\u2019s body?That fist had even shocked Long Chen. If that long-eyebrowed Blood Condensation expert was hit by it, it was doubtless that he would die.But right now, ninety percent of Wilde\u2019s cells were still dormant. If they were all awoken, even Long Chen would feel tremendous fear.But thinking about Wilde\u2019s simple and honest nature, Long Chen shook his head. Wilde was his brother, and the stronger he was, the better. There was no need to worry.Taking out a piece of paper, he wrote down a list of forty-eight names of medicinal ingredients.\u201cStarfusing Pill, a second tier medicinal pill. Right now, I have no way of refining an upper grade second tier medicinal pill. Looks like I can only go to grandmaster Yun Qi. But first I need to collect all the medicinal ingredients.\u201dAccording to Long Chen\u2019s recollections, the Starfusing Pill should be able to resolve the foreign spiritual energies within Chu Yao\u2019s body, but it had to be an upper grade pill.The current Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame was too weak; despite how much talent he had in that regard, it was impossible for him to refine a high grade second tier pill with such a Pill Flame.The next day, Long Chen left his house. Arriving at the alchemist guild\u2019s storeroom, he handed his list over.What was outside Long Chen\u2019s expectations was that all the ingredients could be found here except one of the main ingredients, the Starfusing Grass.Starfusing Grass was an extremely precious treasure. It was something that could be used to refine many second tier pills, and in fact, most second tier pills actually required it in their pill formula, making it always in short supply.Long Chen nodded. Only missing one ingredient was already better than what Long Chen had expected.Collecting his ingredients and leaving the alchemist guild, Long Chen suddenly saw a certain figure. A slightly cruel smile appeared on his mouth.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Martial artists truly did have a tenacious life force.Last time, he had been beaten so badly, but now he seemed totally fine. The Zhou family truly was willing to spend money on their son.Almost every single bone had been broken in his body. It was only by spending a great amount of gold coins that he was pulled back from the gates of hell.But even with the Zhou family\u2019s financial resources, his wounds had still been extremely severe. He had come to the guild today to ask for powerful recovery pills.Currently, he was still extremely weak. Ever since he had been beaten, for some reason he would always start to hallucinate in the middle of the night. Countless demons would plague him, and now he didn\u2019t even dare sleep with the lights off.And furthermore, every morning he would feel his soul ache as if needles were stabbing into him, paining him so badly that he could only roll on the ground.But the alchemists of the guild couldn\u2019t find any reason for this suffering despite examining him multiple times. They could only conclude that it was due to a deficit in qi within him, so they had to first restore his body.But even after half a month passed, he hadn\u2019t improved in that regard in the slightest. The symptoms actually worsened, and even if he didn\u2019t fall asleep, he would see countless demons demanding his life.And as for the pain in his soul in the morning, it was no longer needles, but a blazing flame roasting him, making it so painful he wished he could die. The current Zhou Yaoyang was extremely emaciated, and his complexion was turning yellow, a large difference from his old confident and easy self\u2026\u201cZhou Yaoyang, it\u2019s been a while. How have you been recently?\u201d Long Chen smiled as if he were blessing him and cupped his hands in greeting.As soon as Zhou Yaoyang saw Long Chen, it was as if he had seen a ghost and his face turned deathly pale.\u201cLong Chen\u2026 you\u2026 how are you?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t look so good. It really makes me uneasy. I\u2019m just worried about you. How are the demons at night and the soul roasting in the morning?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 how do you know about that? Could it be\u2026 it was you?\u201d Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s eyes were filled with alarm.He suddenly remembered the medicinal pill Long Chen had fed him after beating him.According to the alchemist guild, it had been a pill to protect the organs and its effect was to make sure that he wouldn\u2019t die for a while despite his internal organ failure.But Zhou Yaoyang always felt that something was wrong with that incident, and hearing Long Chen\u2019s words today, he immediately suspected that pill.\u201cLong Chen, those ghosts were definitely yours! You despicable bastard!\u201d Zhou Yaoyang bitterly exclaimed his resentment.Thinking about the pain he had been going through these days, he angrily shouted and charged at Long Chen.A simple slap landed on his face. The force behind it wasn\u2019t too great and it only sent him flying.\u201cDespicable? You dare call me that? No matter how despicable I am, it\u2019s not even a hundredth of how bad you are! Tell me, just how many despicable methods have you used against me over these years?\u201dLong Chen lightly waved his hand and indifferently said, \u201cYou yourself don\u2019t even remember anymore. Being cruel will always have a reprisal. Now that I\u2019m stronger, am I supposed to not get a bit of revenge?\u201dThe slap on his face completely sobered Zhou Yaoyang. Despite recuperating from his wounds these days, he hadn\u2019t stopped getting information about Long Chen.The fact that Long Chen had beaten an imperial bodyguard of the Grand Xia\u2019s prince had completely shaken the capital; that was a true expert in the Blood Condensation realm!In terms of martial might, Zhou Yaoyang was no longer a match for Long Chen. In terms of status, Long Chen was a grand Pill Apprentice, and he was even less comparable to him.Zhou Yaoyang couldn\u2019t help being suspicious of what the alchemists at the guild had told him. The alchemist guild should be fully aware of all of Long Chen\u2019s methods, so they should have been able to cure him! Instead, they had let him suffer endless torment.But he didn\u2019t know that he had misjudged the guild. Long Chen had applied a bit of Ghost Seeking Liquid atop the medicinal pill. Other than grandmaster Yun Qi, no one else in the guild would be able to figure that out.Obviously, the Savage Marquis had no way of inviting someone as grand as Yun Qi. Let alone him, even a prince didn\u2019t have that capability.\u201cLong Chen, what do you want in order to let me free?\u201d Zhou Yaoyang ground his teeth.\u201cZhou Yaoyang, what happened to all the unyielding courage of yours? You tormented me for so many years but I never gave in to you. Now, things have only turned to my side for such a short time. If you want to stop now, it\u2019s already too late. Gotta follow the rules of the game,\u201d indifferently said Long Chen. He then turned to leave.\u201cYou really won\u2019t let me off?\u201d\u201cIf you want to escape the depths of misery, it\u2019s very simple. Take your sword and pull it against your neck. It only hurts for a second and then you\u2019ll be free. Don\u2019t beg me for help.\u201dZhou Yaoyang was so furious his entire body shook. When he was haunted by ghosts and his soul scorched, he truly did want to use death to free himself of the pain.But as soon as that moment passed, he returned to be a normal person and was full of longing towards life. That was the reason why he couldn\u2019t even kill himself.If he chose life, it was misery. If he chose death, he was unable to go through with it. Zhou Yaoyang was about to collapse. He didn\u2019t have the courage to kill himself, but if it continued like this, he\u2019d go crazy.Zhou Yaoyang ground his teeth and actually knelt on the ground.\u201cLong Chen, I beg you, I admit defeat.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s hatred no longer burned as intensely as it had before. The current Long Chen was high and far above Zhou Yaoyang, and they were no longer on the same level. He didn\u2019t place a small ant within his eyes.Long Chen wasn\u2019t a priest who would repay enmity with kindness. But looking at Zhou Yaoyang\u2019s miserable state, most of his anger faded.And it was also perfect since Long Chen was wishing to hear some secrets from him. Just as he reached his hand to rub his spatial ring, Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength suddenly noticed that Zhou Yaoyang was secretly clenching his fists and was filled with bitter resentment.Long Chen quietly muttered to himself for a moment before he coldly smiled. A medicinal pill appeared out of his spatial ring, and he threw it directly to Zhou Yaoyang.\u201cThis medicinal pill is for you. I hope you won\u2019t be enemies with me in the future; otherwise, you\u2019ll regret it for a lifetime.\u201d Long Chen then left.Zhou Yaoyang waited until Long Chen was far away before getting up. Looking at his distant figure, he narrowed his eyes.\u201cLong Chen, if I don\u2019t let you die a miserable death, then I wouldn\u2019t be Zhou Yaoyang!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t afraid of Long Chen poisoning him because there were several people in the distance who had seen what had just happened. If he really did die from this medicinal pill, Long Chen wouldn\u2019t be able to escape punishment. Therefore, he swallowed the medicinal pill confidently.The next day, Zhou Yaoyang was overjoyed to find that his night terrors were gone, and he no longer had to suffer the feeling of his soul burning every morning.He coldly sneered inside. \u201cLong Chen, just wait. The next time I take action, I\u2019ll be taking your life in one fell swoop. At that time, the person who will be regretful is you!\u201dBack when Long Chen saw Zhou Yaoyang eat it, he also had sneered. You really are too evil to live. I actually wanted to spare your life, but unfortunately, you\u2019re courting disaster.\u201cBrother Long?\u201dLong Chen had been just walking along the road when someone suddenly called out to him.He turned to see that it was fatty Yu. He was amazed to find that he had actually reached the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation. Due to his cultivation, his originally fat build now appeared to be sturdy and strong.\u201cFatty, you\u2019re not bad. You\u2019ve already reached the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation,\u201d smiled Long Chen.\u201cHehe, this is all because of brother Long,\u201d he somewhat bashfully said. \u201cBrother Long, I was just thinking about going over to pay a visit to you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just that since I\u2019ve broken through to the third Heavenstage, I feel like I should celebrate. Look at what Shi Feng did; I can\u2019t be too shameful in comparison right?\u201d said fatty Yu.\u201cHe advanced to the Blood Condensation realm while you are just at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation. Why does there need to be some grand celebration?\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cHaha, those aren\u2019t the same. I couldn\u2019t even cultivate before, so the celebration this time is definitely on the same level as Shi Feng\u2019s!\u201d earnestly said Fatty Yu.\u201cWell, when my bros invite me to drink, I can\u2019t possibly say no! Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, perfect! I\u2019ve already ordered a feast and we\u2019re only lacking you.\u201dThe restaurant fatty Yu brought him to was in the southern side of the city. Although it wasn\u2019t as famous as the one Shi Feng had brought them to, it wasn\u2019t that much worse.When Long Chen entered, he saw that fatty Yu had told the truth; Shi Feng, Shou Hou, and the others were already there.\u201cHaha, Brother Long has finally arrived.\u201dLong Chen also laughed. He greeted everyone, and as soon as he sat down, the food and drinks were brought out.\u201cToday is to celebrate my advancement to the third Heavenstage! I\u2019ve finally taken the first step of my cultivation path, and a bright future has been opened in front of me! This toast is for Long Chen!\u201dEveryone loudly praised him. They were all people whose fates had changed only because of Long Chen.Long Chen also didn\u2019t stand on ceremony and drank a large cup of alcohol in one go.Everyone was friends, so there was no need to restrain oneself and everyone drank copiously. Other than Shi Feng and fatty Yu, the rest of them had yet to advance past the first Heavenstage of Qi Condensation; heroic spirits they had, but a high tolerance of alcohol they did not.After just a few cups, a lot of mouths became unguarded.\u201cBrother Long, it\u2019s like you\u2019re a martial god from the heavens, an unparalleled genius amongst men. We\u2019re all wondering just what kind of woman is suitable for you?\u201d asked someone with the help of the alcohol.Before Long Chen could even answer, Shou Hou followed up, \u201cHehe, at the very least, it\u2019s gotta be a princess. As for looks, it\u2019s got to be a beauty capable of captivating the birds and beasts, eclipsing the moon and shaming flowers. And as for cultivation level? That\u2019s whatever. In any case, no one dares bully brother Long; even the Grand Xia\u2019s prince is not someone he is afraid of! So his future wife doesn\u2019t need to be so strong, haha.\u201d\u201cRight! In our Phoenix Cry Empire, the only one who fits those criteria the best is the third princess!\u201d said fatty Yu, his eyes lighting up.\u201cI\u2019ve seen the third princess before, and although she\u2019s beautiful, that kind of temperament is terrifying. Normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it,\u201d sighed someone else.\u201cTch, that\u2019s because she still hasn\u2019t met brother Long! Even a tiger will become a kitten in front of brother Long!\u201dLong Chen was speechless. When they raised the topic of the third princess, the beautiful image of Chu Yao appeared in his mind.He couldn\u2019t help but to feel some pity. Chu Yao was actually a gentle-hearted woman, but in order to protect herself, she had had to act arrogant and rude to the world.Thinking about the time they\u2019d had together, a warm feeling filled him. At the same time, he felt awkward inside; wasn\u2019t talking about things like this unworthy of Chu Yao?Long Chen was in the middle of thinking that over when a woman\u2019s cold laugh rang out.\u201cYou outrageous peasants really do think of the craziest things. Is the third princess someone you are capable of discussing?\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fatty Yu cursed, \u201cWhat idiot woman is that? Get out for daddy!\u201dJust as he finished speaking, a table whistled over from the corridor, smashing towards them.But it suddenly stopped in mid-air. Long Chen had grabbed it, and with a flick of his hand, he sent it flying back.A woman had just walked out over there. She had a disdainful expression and that table had clearly been thrown by her.To actually first throw a table to smash them and then walk out, what a lofty manner.But she hadn\u2019t expected that the table she had thrown would actually be smashing back at her with over ten times the force. Just the gale force created by the table made it hard for her to breath.It had happened too quickly, and it was already too late for her to dodge. If she was hit by it, she would definitely end up with some broken bones.The table suddenly blew apart. A man with a blade scar appeared in everyone\u2019s eyes as he protected the woman.When everyone saw him, their expressions once more changed as they recognized him as the personal bodyguard of the Grand Xia\u2019s prince.The scarred man was startled to see Long Chen and he narrowed his eyes, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to run into you again so soon.\u201dAlthough he had managed to break that table apart, he had not managed to completely disperse the force. A heavy footprint was left on the floor, showing that he had misjudged Long Chen\u2019s strength.\u201cNo way around it. I am a young person after all. Gotta act energetically and move forward bit by bit every day. I can\u2019t compare to someone as amazing as yourself who has already planted himself down and no longer moves forward. I, however, still have a long path to travel,\u201d he indifferently said.The scarred man\u2019s face darkened, and he was just about to reply when another voice rang out. \u201cHaha, it\u2019s been a couple of days, but brother Long is still as suave as ever.\u201dThe Grand Xia\u2019s prince, Xia Changfeng slowly walked up with the same likable smiling face he had used before.Xia Changfeng smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s just a misunderstanding. Let me introduce you to my sister, Xia Baichi.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s jaw dropped. So this crazy woman was actually a princess!So this was the reason grandmaster Yun Qi had told him to be careful around her.\u201cHmph, now you know how great the difference between us is!\u201d Xia Baichi sneered at Long Chen\u2019s shock.He shook his head. \u201cYes, we really are quite different. Even if I trained for ten thousand years, I wouldn\u2019t be comparable to an idiot like you. Xia Baichi, what a great name.\u201d[1]\u201cYou!\u201d Her eyes practically spit out flames.Not only Xia Baichi, but even Xia Changfeng\u2019s eyes turned cold for a moment before he smiled, \u201cOkay, now that everyone knows each other, I wonder what you were talking about before for it to get this lively?\u201dFatty Yu and the others were naturally a bit uncomfortable with the Grand Xia\u2019s prince here. After all, he was a prince, and the difference in status was too great.They weren\u2019t as obstinate as Long Chen and didn\u2019t dare say anything out of place to him. They were all silent for a moment.Xia Baichi sneered, \u201cI heard these toads insulting the third princess and talking about who she would marry. But funnily none of them knew my brother has already given a betrothal gift to the Empress Dowager to win the third princess over. For these guys to put their sights on my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, they really are courting death.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s expression changed at that news. He coldly asked Xia Changfeng, \u201cIs this true?\u201d\u201cLong Chen, control your attitude,\u201d warned the scarred man.\u201cNo matter.\u201d Xia Changfeng waved his hands at the scarred man. He smiled at Long Chen, \u201cThe reason I came to the Phoenix Cry Empire this time was because my father ordered me to propose to the third princess. Since the Empress Dowager has already agreed, we should be able to quickly set a date. If brother Long has time in the future, I invite you to come to my Grand Xia for the wedding feast.\u201dWho knew whether Xia Changfeng was doing it on purpose, but his expression towards Long Chen was one of a victor looking pitifully on the loser.Did he know? Long Chen couldn\u2019t help being worried despite knowing that Xia Changfeng was purposely provoking him.But his anger still rose up uncontrollably. Maybe if he was doing this without knowing the truth then it would be fine.But Long Chen knew that there was a conspiracy around Chu Yao. Those foreign spiritual energies within her were seeds of energy waiting to be reaped. It appeared someone had come to finally harvest them now that they were ripe.Although the person who had set them in place wasn\u2019t Xia Changfeng, he was the one benefitting from it, so he was definitely a participant. He must know many secrets.Thinking about his own experiences, he wondered whether his situation had anything to do with Xia Changfeng. The probability was definitely high.His killing intent boiled when he thought of the conspiracies around him and Chu Yao. But now still wasn\u2019t the time to take action. He still had to get stronger.Only the tip of the iceberg had been revealed to him now. He still wasn\u2019t in control, so he needed to endure. Keeping this in mind, his anger was quickly replaced with calmness.Seeing Long Chen\u2019s angry expression suddenly fade, Xia Changfeng\u2019s heart shook slightly. The caution he felt towards Long Chen increased; enemies who could control their emotions were the truly terrifying ones.\u201cBrother Xia, I don\u2019t think you should propose to the third princess.\u201d Long Chen shook his head.\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve studied the secrets of fate. When I did some calculations for you, I realized brother Xia\u2019s name contains the word \u2018wind\u2019, while the third princess\u2019s name contains the word \u2018forest\u2019. Wind will destroy the forest, so it\u2019s not good for the third princess.\u201d Long Chen was watching Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression.[2]\u201cHaha, brother Long really is funny. How could such a thing be given true credence?\u201d laughed Xia Changfeng.Long Chen\u2019s eyes became even gloomier. By using his divine sense to its limits, he had noticed that while Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression might not have changed while he had spoken, his heart had jumped a bit.Hmph, so this bastard really does know quite a lot.\u201cNot so. My ability to read faces is definitely at the master level; brother Xia, you have much fire in your life, and that is why you were given the name Changfeng. Fire borrows the power of the wind. Such a flame spreads for thousands of miles with nothing being able to block it anymore. It truly is a good name,\u201d praised Long Chen.Xia Changfeng smiled slightly, but he also paused for a moment, his heart going wild. Did Long Chen really have such skills?His name really had been inspired by a mysterious person who had explained it just as Long Chen had explained it. His life was fire-fated, and only due to this did his parents name him Changfeng.Although he kept his expression as calm as ever, his heart was jumping and his blood surging. The change in his breathing was unable to escape Long Chen\u2019s awareness.Long Chen laughed inside, not expecting his fake act to actually touch upon something. He continued, \u201cAs for our third princess, her name contains the \u2018Yao\u2019 character. You are fire-fated, but her name has water. More importantly, her name also has the character for \u2018king\u2019, so it\u2019s not just ordinary water, but the king of water.[3]\u201cWind and forest repel each other, while water will put out fire. You cannot marry someone with such a name. And furthermore, the capital is surrounded by water on four sides, so it\u2019s far too risky for brother Xia.\u201cIf you dare marry the third princess, you most likely won\u2019t live long enough to leave the Phoenix Cry Empire. So, I advise you to give up on this notion.\u201cWomen are like clothes; for just a piece of clothing, you will put your life in danger? It\u2019s just not worth it.\u201dShi Feng, fatty Yu, and the others\u2019 expressions all changed. Was he threatening the prince?As for Long Chen\u2019s ability to read faces, they half believed it and half doubted it. But now, Long Chen was explaining it all very clearly and they couldn\u2019t help trusting it.At this time, Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression was very unsightly. Long Chen\u2019s words made him very uncomfortable as he had no way to refute them.\u201cDon\u2019t try deluding us with your lies. You think you can confuse a prince just by using a few parlor tricks? I think you\u2019re getting tired of living,\u201d shouted the scarred man angrily.\u201cA dog who won\u2019t listen actually dares talk before his master?\u201d frowned Long Chen.From the start, he could feel the scarred man\u2019s killing intent. And that killing intent chilled him to his bones.That meant the scarred man was mulling over how to kill him. Long Chen definitely wouldn\u2019t give him any face.\u201cBastard!\u201d The scarred man angrily shouted and punched at Long Chen.\u201cSTOP!\u201dXia Changfeng prevented the scarred man from attacking. He had already returned to his normal state at this time, and he smiled at Long Chen. \u201cWho would have thought brother Long had such a humorous side? My horizons have truly been broadened. Unfortunately, I still have things to do at this time, so let\u2019s talk another day.\u201dXia Changfeng brought both the scarred man and Xia Baichi away, but Xia Baichi still gave Long Chen an angry glare; her disdainful gaze seeming to consider Long Chen to be just a piece of meat.After getting down the stairs, the scarred man ruthlessly said, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you blocking me, Long Chen would already be a dead man now.\u201d\u201cThis Long Chen definitely has to die. I also almost lost control of myself. That bastard really is loathsome. But Long Chen still has other uses for now. If he died, then it would affect our plans. Let him live a few more days,\u201d sighed Xia Changfeng.Even someone as calm as him had almost taken action to attack him. He was truly infuriated.\u201cMaster sent orders for me to defeat Long Chen in front of that old bastard Yun Qi. If you kill him before then, it will definitely anger that old ghost,\u201d coldly said Xia Baichi. \u201cThat old idiot. Whether I sincerely begged or tried to seduce him, he just wouldn\u2019t help me. What a waste of time.\u201dXia Changfeng looked at her and shook his head. \u201cFrom the beginning, master\u2019s attempts at having you entice him were unlikely to work.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dXia Changfeng shook his head and didn\u2019t reply. The scarred man beside him sighed, \u201cBecause princess, you don\u2019t have the proper temperament of a woman.\u201dXia Baichi sent a slap at the scarred man\u2019s face, but he just smiled indifferently, seeming very accustomed to this.Once they had left, Long Chen and the rest also lost interest in drinking. Long Chen felt as if time was running out for him.The closer he got to the truth, the more dangerous it became. Once the whole truth was revealed, if he didn\u2019t have enough strength, then he would undoubtedly die.But there was fundamentally not enough time. He had to take advantage of every moment to cultivate. Just the slightest increase in power would give him a greater chance at surviving.But Chu Yao\u2019s situation was also pressing on him. He had to race against time and resolve her matter.\u201cAre you Long Chen?\u201dSuddenly, a lean, middle-aged man walked up the restaurant and greeted Long Chen.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 Huayun Pavilion InvitationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cAre you Long Chen?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201d Long Chen was startled, as he himself didn\u2019t even recognize this person.\u201cPerfect. Under the pavilion master\u2019s orders, I have come to give you this invitation card.\u201d The lean middle-aged man rejoiced. \u201cYoung noble, you might not recognize me, but my lowly self is an attendant of the Huayun Pavilion. I have especially come to invite you to our annual auction.\u201dOnly now did Long Chen understand. He was being pulled into some kind of business work. As for being an \u2018attendant\u2019, it would be more accurate to just call him a foot runner.Long Chen had a great understanding of this Huayun Pavilion. It was the most famous auction house in the Phoenix Cry Empire and was an extremely huge existence.Although it might not be comparable to the alchemist guild, it was definitely powerful. It was the closest partner of the adventurers guild.The adventurers guild was an alliance formed by countless adventurers, and although it was a loose partnership, it had many members.Adventurers traveled the wilderness for most of their days, and although it was an extremely dangerous occupation, its rewards were also accordingly great.All kinds of strange medicinal herbs and Magical Beast cores could be found, and if one\u2019s luck was really ridiculous, then it was even possible to find an ancient inheritance.Adventurers were very fond of collaborating with the Huayun Pavilion due to their extremely fair prices. Selling their gains there was the most secure method to sell their spoils.Some of them didn\u2019t go into danger themselves. They would make deals with other people or even kill others for their spoils. Those were extremely common affairs. Sometimes, the city was even more frightful than the wilderness.So, the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s annual auction would always attract countless people. They would select the rarest treasures that they had gathered over the year for that auction.Almost every auction would result in them delighting at the high bidding, so the extent of their auction also became greater over the time.In the past two years, the auction\u2019s quality had become incredibly great, and they had even set down new rules. It was now impossible to enter without an invitation card.And the people who could obtain an invitation card were only people with exceedingly high statuses. Long Chen was the first youth to receive such a thing.\u201cThis is a great thing, brother Long. But if you don\u2019t have enough money, then it would just be a waste of time,\u201d said Shou Hou.The Huayun Pavilion\u2019s auction wares were all the best amongst the best. Every single item was extremely desirable.Adding on the auction house\u2019s expert advertising and enticements, the price would soar wildly all the time. Without money, you could only look with envy.\u201cDo you have a list of things being auctioned?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cThis lowly one only has a list of the first ten things. You can have a look,\u201d the lean man apologetically said.In order to maintain its mystery, the best things being auctioned off would never be allowed to be leaked.Long Chen looked over it. His pupils shrank when he saw the Starfusing Grass on the list. It was actually Starfusing Grass that was over a thousand years old.Normal Starfusing Grass was always within ten to a hundred years old. Over a hundred years old was rare, and over a thousand years old made it an exceptionally precious treasure.Such a treasure was actually just the first item of the list.Seeing Long Chen\u2019s shock, the lean man became pleased and said, \u201cAs a Pill Apprentice, any precious medicinal pills you have can be handed over to us. If the quality and rareness of it reach the standards, we can consider adding it to the auction. But we charge 50% commission.\u201dFifty percent?! Ha, how vicious. You actually dare ask for fifty percent? Do you dare ask for more?As if seeing through Long Chen\u2019s thoughts, he laughed, \u201cAs long as what you have is good enough, then after our packaging and advertising, in addition to our chief auctioneer\u2019s embellishment, the price will definitely rise far beyond your imaginations.\u201dHearing that, Long Chen became more at ease. At the same time, he felt a bit of admiration at how they ran their business.What Long Chen didn\u2019t know was that this man\u2019s job really wasn\u2019t as easy as he thought it was. The people in the lean man\u2019s position would get three quotas for the annual auction, meaning they were only allowed to invite three people.Whether those people were buying or selling things, the one who had invited him would get a set percentage.The more they bought or sold, the more money that person would get. So each person invited had to be carefully selected.But after this many years, more and more wealthy people were being invited earlier, leaving only a few behind. Now they were just picking over the dredges.This lean man was very astute, so as soon as he had received his quota, he had rushed over to invite Long Chen, afraid that others would get there first.There was no other way. Long Chen was the most famous person within his generation in the capital, and he was definitely a big fish with potential.\u201cPlease look over this lowly one\u2019s calling card.\u201d He handed over a small card to Long Chen.\u201cFu Gui?\u201d[1]\u201cHaha, I come from a poor family. My parents wished for me to gain riches, so they came up with such a name.\u201d The lean man explained with embarrassment.His explanation also caused Long Chen to feel a bit of sympathy. Nodding, he said, \u201cI am definitely very interested in buying things. I also have some things that I want to auction off. How does it work?\u201dFu Gui\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cAny treasures can be brought directly to the Huayun Pavilion. We can also go to your door to get them.\u201dLong Chen nodded. There was just less than a month until the auction, so he still had time. After setting an appointment with Fu Gui, Long Chen and the others all left the restaurant.\u201cLong Chen, the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival is a week from now. You definitely have to come out,\u201d said Shi Feng expectantly.The Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival was the largest celebration of the empire. The entire capital\u2019s unmarried population would participate. It was extremely lively, and it was the festival that all the young people looked forward to the most.Especially those unmarried men; each of them would be like a bull, determinedly waiting for a chance of attracting a woman\u2019s attention.As for the women, they also wanted to see if they could find an acceptable man.It was a bit controversial for men and women to be together like this, but during the one day of the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival, all those taboos were lifted, and both genders could party wildly together as much as they wanted to.Thus, many of them made preparations beforehand for this festival.And the most fun part of it was the fight over the number one junior warrior in their generation. There would always be a martial stage during the festival. As long as you were a cultivator and were under twenty years old, anyone could go up.The first place battle was the highlight. As long as you got that title, it would no longer even be possible for you to be low-key. Countless women would send flowers after you, enough to bury you even. Just thinking about it set the men\u2019s hearts on fire.Even the calm Shi Feng was burning with passion. And as expected, fatty Yu and the others were all bursting with enthusiasm.\u201cBrother Long, you definitely have to come. If you don\u2019t go, then we won\u2019t want to go either,\u201d begged fatty Yu.\u201cThen how about none of us go and we\u2019ll find somewhere to get a drink instead,\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cNooo, master Long. We\u2019ve been waiting for this for a year!!\u201d Fatty Yu and the others immediately acted sullen. Some of them got on their knees and hugged Long Chen\u2019s legs, not letting go until he agreed.\u201cLong Chen, if you don\u2019t go, then it will be too boring. In the capital, you are the most famous of our generation! You\u2019re viewed as number one, and if you don\u2019t go, then it will disappoint countless people,\u201d persuaded Shi Feng.\u201cHm? When did I get such a big name?\u201d Long Chen was startled.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Even the little kids know about it. Dual martial and pill cultivation that shakes heaven and earth, the Heroic Assembly House\u2019s angry god, the one who spread his wings and flew out of the Phoenix Cry Empire, the one who laughs arrogantly at the nine heavens, Long Chen.\u201d Shi Feng looked at Long Chen strangely.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat kind of situation is this? How did I not know? There are poems about me? Long Chen was struck foolishly silent.\u201cOkay, brother Long, all your brothers are hoping to enjoy the festivities with you. But whatever you say is what we\u2019ll do.\u201dShi Feng wasn\u2019t the same as the others. He had considered Long Chen as his brother from the start, so he didn\u2019t need to have as many misgivings as the others.\u201cUgh, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Long Chen smiled bitterly; he had originally been planning on training for an extra day.Fatty Yu and the others all cheered at that. It was as if they were seeing a scene of countless beautiful women before them.After splitting ways with the others, Long Chen quickly rushed home. He didn\u2019t even eat dinner; the time he was wasting was too great. He had to urgently increase his cultivation base.Although the FengFu Star had already been perfectly condensed, but now that he had gained a Dantian, he wanted to quickly condense more cyclones.There were currently only three cyclones in his Dantian. He wanted to continue forming them, but there was no clue on how to do so within the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art in his memories.Back when the FengFu Star had condensed, three of the cyclones had appeared all at once. Even Long Chen didn\u2019t know how it had happened.Now, Long Chen found that when he circulated his Dantian, the three cyclones would also revolve with it. This method was only for continuously sending energy throughout him for battle, and wasn\u2019t for cultivating.Drawing some of the FengFu Star\u2019s spiritual energy out to the cyclones, they immediately grew ten times the size and Long Chen\u2019s breathing became rushed in anticipation. But this was also for battle and not how to cultivate them.Long Chen took a deep breath, and hesitating for a moment, he slowly circulated his qi to absorb the outside world\u2019s spiritual qi.However, this time, he didn\u2019t send it throughout his body but gathered it into his FengFu Star.Following Long Chen\u2019s absorption of heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi, the FengFu Star started to quickly circulate.\u201cThis is the way!\u201dLong Chen was elated; although he didn\u2019t know exactly what was happening, this definitely seemed to be more for cultivating and less for battle.Doing his best to continue absorbing, the FengFu star gradually became brighter under the continuous absorption. In the end, it appeared like a blazing sun.BOOM!The FengFu Star shook, and it immediately became dimmer. At the same time, another cyclone appeared within Long Chen\u2019s Dantian.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve finally found the way to continue cultivating.\u201dAlong with the fourth cyclone\u2019s formation, Long Chen found out that the meridians within his body had also expanded slightly, and his whole body was surging with energy.\u201cGood, let\u2019s continue.\u201dLong Chen slowly closed his eyes and began to attack the fifth Heavenstage.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The fourth prince was sitting with his eyelids half closed as he quietly listened to the Savage Marquis\u2019s report.\u201cMaster, no news has come from the Border Suppression Marquis. The army continues to hold the same area and no reply has come from master\u2019s letters,\u201d reported the Savage Marquis respectfully.The fourth prince slowly opened his eyes. Within them was a glimmer of cold grimness. \u201cWhat a reckless, obstinate old man. I gave him that much time yet he still treats me like some pushover.\u201d\u201cThis Long Tianxiao truly doesn\u2019t know greatness. He still refuses to surrender to prince after this many years. Truly hateful to the point of deserving a thousand deaths,\u201d said the Savage Marquis ruthlessly.The fourth prince glanced at him and said, \u201cI know about the past grievances between you and Long Tianxiao. If it hadn\u2019t been for that punch of his, then you would have had a high chance of advancing to the Tendon Transformation realm. But Long Tianxiao\u2019s strength doesn\u2019t just lie in his martial might; otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t view him so importantly. Unfortunately, he\u2019s too stubborn and can\u2019t be used by me. Since he can\u2019t become one of mine, let him become a dead man.\u201dThe Savage Marquis rejoiced when he heard of this. \u201cMaster, do you have a plan?\u201d\u201cRight now isn\u2019t the time to deal with him. However, he has indeed wasted so many years of my effort. So first, kill his only son. Count it as him paying some interest,\u201d said the fourth prince indifferently.\u201cLong Chen? How should he be killed?\u201d asked the Savage Marquis, somewhat puzzled.The current Long Chen counted as one of the alchemist guild\u2019s people and the rumors reported that he was close to grandmaster Yun Qi. Even a prince couldn\u2019t avoid the alchemist guild\u2019s punishment.\u201cI\u2019ve already fixed that matter, so you don\u2019t need to worry about it. Just quietly gather your forces. We\u2019re about to make some big moves; don\u2019t forget to not attract any undue attention,\u201d ordered the fourth prince coldly.\u201cYes, master. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely make sure there\u2019s not even the slightest leak,\u201d promised the Savage Marquis hastily.His current strength was just at the Blood Condensation realm, so his martial might wasn\u2019t very outstanding. And it was exactly because he wasn\u2019t overly eye-attracting that the fourth prince gave him such a high position.He was extremely loyal and devoted, and he was also very meticulous with how he handled things. He hadn\u2019t made any slipups in all the years he had worked for him.After the Savage Marquis left, the fourth prince looked at the books on his shelves. A long while later, he sighed.\u201cLong Tianxiao. Is it worth the trouble? So much of my sincerity over the years was unable to move you. Don\u2019t blame me for being vicious.\u201d\u2026BOOM!Another explosion rang out within his body, and Long Chen\u2019s eyes popped open. His eyes shined brightly like the stars, yet his gaze was as sharp as a sword.Seven cyclones were slowly revolving within his Dantian. A pleased smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face.He had spent seven full days focused only on cultivating, advancing four levels. Such a speed would definitely shock and frighten anyone else, yet Long Chen still wasn\u2019t satisfied with it.Originally, he had thought that as he condensed more cyclones, his cultivation would become faster since he could absorb more energy. But he quickly found out that his assumption had been wrong.Every new cyclone had been harder to condense than the last. The amount of spiritual qi needed exponentially shot up; the fourth cyclone had only required six hours to form, while the seventh cyclone had required three full days.That was basically the sum of all the three cyclones before it. But Long Chen was still pleased when he noticed that his meridians had become even firmer as he reached the seventh Heavenstage.However, he was still unable to use Split the Heavens. But this didn\u2019t disappoint him; in fact, it made him even more excited. This meant that Split the Heavens was an exceptionally powerful Battle Skill. For him to have used some random pill to exchange for such a high class Battle Skill had definitely been worth it.Originally, he had been planning on going back there and bribing that Blood Condensation expert with more medicinal pills for some more high grade Battle Skills.But now that Chu Yao had given him the Breaking Wind Fist and the Flamecloud Palm, he had enough. The two of them were both high Mortal class Battle Skills. Most likely, only the third floor of the Battle Skill Pavilion would hold Battle Skills of that level. Battle Skills on that level were things that even that Blood Condensation guard would not have the qualifications to learn.It was not the case that the more Battle Skills you learned, the better. Unless martial artists were pushed to their limit, they normally wouldn\u2019t use them.That was because Battle Skills used too much spiritual qi. Ordinary Qi Condensation cultivators could only use a low grade Mortal Battle Skill once.After using it once, their remaining spiritual qi would be insufficient to use it a second time. So unless you could defeat your enemy in one move, no one would waste their spiritual qi like that.Furthermore, the higher the class of the Battle Skill, the more spiritual qi would be required to use it. High Mortal class Battle Skills were normally reserved for Blood Condensation cultivators to use.Only they had the required spiritual qi for such a frightening cost. But of course, Long Chen wasn\u2019t ordinary.His spiritual qi was stored within his FengFu Star. By Long Chen\u2019s calculations, he could use a high Mortal class Battle Skill seven times.But if he were to send his FengFu Star\u2019s spiritual qi to his seven cyclones in order to produce his absolute max power, then he would only be able to use a high Mortal class Battle Skill once. He wouldn\u2019t be able to use it a second time even if he forced himself to death.Currently, Long Chen still could not condense a second star. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art required that only after the first star became a \u2018true star\u2019 could the second star be condensed.But Long Chen still didn\u2019t know how to make his star a \u2018true star\u2019. He also didn\u2019t know what the nine star transformations in his memories were. He really was becoming more and more puzzled as he progressed on his cultivation path with the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Therefore, he could only continue forming more cyclones for now.\u201cYoung master, can I enter?\u201d Bao-er\u2019s clear voice came from outside.\u201cEnter.\u201dBao-er entered with a set of clothes in her hands. She laughed, \u201cYoung master, today is the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival. Mrs. Long has sent me to make you presentable.\u201dShe had him sit down properly while she washed his face and combed his hair. Long Chen laughed, \u201cIs this really so important?\u201d\u201cHaha, the Madam has already said that young master is now sixteen and is the age for getting married. She told me to properly dress you. If any family\u2019s pretty daughter sees you, haha\u2026 you understand.\u201d Bao-er laughed.\u201cNo way. My mom really thinks it\u2019s that urgent?\u201d Long Chen was speechless. Fatty Yu and the others were all seventeen, but they hadn\u2019t gotten married.\u201cOf course it\u2019s urgent. I worry about my grandchildren.\u201d Mrs. Long walked in and looked at Long Chen. \u201cThe matter of Meng Qi can be handled slowly and considered a long term goal. But you also need to have short term goals. It\u2019s called insurance. I suggest you go find a suitable young lady and get some kids while also pursuing Meng Qi.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t believe his ears.\u201cWhat? For a man to have multiple wives and concubines is common. Isn\u2019t it fine to just reserve Meng Qi as the first wife?\u201d Mrs. Long spoke as if that was as it should be.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cOf course. But you can\u2019t tell Meng Qi about it at the beginning. Once you two become closer, she\u2019ll naturally agree to it.\u201dLong Chen blinked. Even this was fine? \u201cMom, dad hasn\u2019t bothered to communicate with us in this many years. Does he also have wives and concubines outside?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say so much nonsense. But it would be absolutely fine for your father to have some extra wives or concubines,\u201d she chided. But a guilty, ashamed glimmer flashed through her eyes.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m just joking mom. Don\u2019t worry, if there are any suitable women during the Lantern Festival, I\u2019ll bring a few back for you.\u201d Seeing his mom wasn\u2019t very happy, he joked.\u201cTch, who do you think you are to bring \u2018a few\u2019 home? Let me tell you, don\u2019t try any fake smiles with your mom. You have to properly remember this matter, understood?\u201d she solemnly warned.\u201cFine, fine, fine. I\u2019ll act however you tell me,\u201d promised Long Chen. Inside, he didn\u2019t feel that it was quite right, but he didn\u2019t dare say that out loud to his mother.After making himself presentable, Long Chen put on a blue robe. It was the perfect size and after putting it on, he looked like a whole new person.Sword-like eyebrows and glowing with health; although he wasn\u2019t outstandingly handsome, Bao-er unceasingly praised him.\u201cHaha, don\u2019t worry Madam. How many women could resist our young master?\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t praise him too much.\u201d Although Mrs. Long said this, she was pleased inside. She was filled with pride looking at her handsome son.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s time. Go.\u201d Mrs. Long pushed Long Chen out the door.\u201cMom, the sun is still so high. It\u2019s going to be a while before it darkens,\u201d Long Chen helplessly pointed out as he looked at the western sun that had barely begun to descend.\u201cBad child, you don\u2019t know what it means to prepare early. First get a good spot, and only then can you increase your chances. Quick, go.\u201dAfter saying this, she closed the gates on him.Long Chen rolled his eyes. It wasn\u2019t like he was setting up a stall for business. Why did he need to first occupy a good position? But since he was already driven out, he still left.He saw countless people bustling in front of their homes, hanging lanterns. Seeing Long Chen, a youth joked, \u201cBrother, you really are early.\u201d\u201cWhat do you know? The early bird gets the worm,\u201d retorted Long Chen.\u201cHa, true. Many thanks for the reminder big brother. I\u2019ll go change now.\u201d That person ran back into his house.\u201cWhat a kid. Only thirteen yet he wants to play with women.\u201dHis mouth twitched. The children these days really were maturing too early. He had also truly come out too soon, and when others saw that he had come out so early, it only led to more jokes from people along the way.He was early enough to be embarrassed, but he also didn\u2019t have enough time to go cultivate either. And just sitting around would also be boring.Just as he was hesitating on what to do next, an almost solid murderous aura attacked him. A gust of wind shot straight towards Long Chen\u2019s back.Hastily turning, Long Chen\u2019s fist just managed to block a sneak attacker\u2019s punch.Gale winds exploded when they collided, and Long Chen was forced back several steps. Raising his head, he saw a masked man who was sending another punch at him. The man\u2019s strength was very great and the wind whistled with his every blow.Long Chen coldly snorted. Ignoring the punch, he kicked between that person\u2019s legs.That person\u2019s battle experience was very rich, and he directly stopped his punch and switched to defense, his leg blocking Long Chen\u2019s attack.After blocking it, a fierce energy erupted from that person\u2019s body. A fist ripped through the space and completely cut off Long Chen\u2019s retreat paths.Coldness filled Long Chen\u2019s eyes. Just as he was about to use all his power, he suddenly thought of something.\u201cSpirit of the Bull!\u201dLong Chen shouted and their punches collided. He was sent flying dozens of steps, his blood surging tumultuously.Just as that person was about to keep attacking after sending Long Chen flying, he suddenly turned to see the shadows of people approaching them.\u201cHmph, kid, next time I\u2019ll take your life.\u201d He coldly snorted when he saw the pale-faced Long Chen. He disappeared in front of Long Chen\u2019s eyes with shocking speed.After he left, Long Chen\u2019s pale face once more returned to its normal rosiness.\u201cIdiot, you want to test my power?\u201dLong Chen patted the dust off his clothes. Looking in the direction where that person left from, a certain thought arose in his mind\u2026Looks like tonight won\u2019t be so boring after all!You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he had appeared to be trying to kill him, that was just an act.What kind of assassin would reveal his killing intent before striking? No real killer would make such a basic error.And that person hadn\u2019t had any true killing intent, only a murderous aura. Although each attack was powerful, he had obviously been holding back.It was a completely different style from an assassin. So at the last moment, Long Chen deliberately lost and allowed himself to be sent flying. He concealed how much spiritual energy he had and pretended to be injured.As he had expected, this \u2018killer\u2019 immediately left. Did they think he was an idiot? Those people who had been coming over were just ordinary people who he could have easily killed first before leaving.But the killer had acted startled and retreated hastily. Long Chen snorted disdainfully at such shoddy acting.He knew that person definitely had to have a high status who was too prideful and believed himself to be infallible.Although he didn\u2019t know why he had been tested, Long Chen knew there would definitely be a follow-up. Otherwise, all of this would have been meaningless.\u201cBrother Long, you really are early haha.\u201dAs he was considering this, he ended up walking into the public plaza, and Shou Hou shouted out to him excitedly.The plaza was several miles wide, and countless lanterns dozens of meters tall had been set out. But since it hadn\u2019t turned dark yet, they hadn\u2019t been lit.Crowds of people were bustling in the plaza. All kinds of constructions were being finished.Despite not being lit, the countless varied lanterns were still a spectacular sight.Young men and women were all over the plaza and starting to play. The sound of conversation filled the air, and occasional bell-like laughter would ring out.But some of those laughs were extremely unpleasant to listen to. Who knew whether those braying laughs were always like that or whether it was due to this being a special occasion, but they caused one\u2019s hair to stand on end.The women were holding hands and having fun, while at the same time, secretly stealing glances at the men. Although it was almost autumn, the plaza gave off a fresh feeling of spring.Some of the men truly were doing as Long Chen\u2019s mother had said and had picked a high spot early on. Some of them were on high rocks, some on bridges, their hands waving a fan in front of them in a flirtatious manner.What shocked and caused him to be speechless was that some of them were acting like roosters and being excessively lewd.\u201cShou Hou, this is the legendary Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival with handsome men and beautiful women?\u201d Long Chen almost couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.\u201cUh\u2026 brother Long, we\u2019re early. The truly beautiful women haven\u2019t come out yet. Only those people without confidence come this early,\u201d he awkwardly explained. But as soon he said it he backtracked. \u201cBut brother Long is definitely an exception.\u201dLong Chen truly had come too early. He blamed it all on his mom and had an urge to cry. But as the sky gradually darkened, more and more people started to show up.These new additions were definitely a grade better than the ones who had gotten there so early. At the very least, their laughs were not so frightening. It was pretty good in terms of both numbers and quality.\u201cHaha, brother Long, you really came.\u201d Shi Feng had just arrived, quickly noticing Long Chen and Shou Hou who were hiding in a corner.\u201cHaha, brother Long, you really are dashing today.\u201d Fatty Yu and the others also came in succession and came to greet Long Chen.\u201cFatty Yu, you aren\u2019t bad either. You\u2019ve lost quite a bit of weight. In the past, we didn\u2019t even know how you managed to squeeze into places,\u201d joked Shou Hou. Everyone also laughed.As they were having fun, more and more people ended up showing up, and the plaza became completely full.The young people were all in small groups within the crowd and quietly chatting. But all of their gazes were roving around, looking for targets.\u201cLong Chen, let\u2019s join them. It\u2019s almost time for the lantern festival to begin,\u201d said Shi Feng.Fatty Yu and the others were already feeling a bit pressed. But since Long Chen never said anything, they had only waited beside him patiently.Actually, Long Chen really didn\u2019t want to go into the crowd. But not wanting to be rude, he still resolved himself to enter the huge crowd of people.As soon as Long Chen\u2019s group entered, they attracted many people\u2019s attention. One reason was because they were one of the last groups to join.But this group of people was also very special. Tall, short, fat, skinny, there was someone for anyone\u2019s taste.\u201cHuh, who\u2019s that? How handsome! How come I\u2019ve never seen him before?\u201d One woman immediately let out a surprised shout.Long Chen was definitely not bad in terms of looks, but it definitely hadn\u2019t reached the point of amazing and awing people. But as for whether a flower was pretty or not was decided in the eye of the beholder.Beside fatty Yu, Shou Hou, and the others, even the dark-faced Shi Feng appeared much more handsome than normal.\u201cYou don\u2019t know? That\u2019s Long Chen, the Border Suppression Marquis\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cHeavens, he\u2019s Long Chen? The Long Chen praised as the capital\u2019s number one in the junior generation?\u201d\u201cI heard he\u2019s even a Pill Apprentice and might even become grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s first disciple.\u201dGossip about him filled the air, and many women sent furtive gazes his way. Some of the bold ones actually started to shout his name.Sweat started to roll down his face. Long Chen had never seen such a battle, and no matter how thick his face was, he still couldn\u2019t block it all out.\u201cBrother Shi, you go to the front. Fatty Yu and Hou-zi[1], you guys come up a bit more too.\u201dLong Chen straightforwardly hid behind his friends, lowering his head while he walked. This relieved quite a bit of pressure on him.After wading through the crowd for a bit, they arrived at a huge martial arena that was hundreds of meters wide.\u201cLong Chen, this martial arena is for finding the number one junior warrior in the Phoenix Cry Empire. Are you interested?\u201d smiled Shi Feng.\u201cDefinitely not. I don\u2019t like being a trick-performing monkey.\u201d Long Chen shook his head.\u201cHehe, then I\u2019m relieved,\u201d laughed Shi Feng.Long Chen was startled for a moment before realizing that Shi Feng was actually after that title.\u201cGood luck.\u201d Long Chen extended a fist.Shi Feng bumped fists with him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as it\u2019s not you, then I should be okay.\u201d\u201cHey, you two are being rude. You keep ignoring our needs. Let\u2019s go bros, we\u2019ll take advantage of our time and go fool around,\u201d shouted Shou Hou as he pulled the rest of the group away.\u201cRemember to meet back here in a while,\u201d shouted back Shi Feng.The two of them didn\u2019t even know whether they were heard. The others disappeared quickly into the crowd, each looking for a target.\u201cShi Feng, how\u2019s your cultivation base?\u201d Seeing no one was around, Long Chen quietly asked him.\u201cThe peak of the first Heavenstage of Blood Condensation. In just a short while, I should be able to reach the second level,\u201d Shi Feng replied gratefully.The reason he had managed to reach his current level so quickly had been because of Long Chen\u2019s assistance. The earlier someone entered the Blood Condensation realm, the greater it would benefit their future cultivation.If someone only managed to break through to Blood Condensation after thirty, then that person probably would never be able to progress past the first Heavenstage of Blood Condensation.Currently, Shi Feng wasn\u2019t even eighteen but had broken through to Blood Condensation realm. In the future, he would have over a thirty percent chance of advancing to the Tendon Transformation realm.The Tendon Transformation realm was the level which the strongest existences in the empire were at. There were only three of them in the entire Phoenix Cry Empire.Long Chen nodded. Such a speed meant that Shi Feng was extremely hardworking. But when he examined Shi Feng\u2019s Dantian, he found that his Spirit Root was only of average quality. The Tendon Transformation realm would probably be the limit of his martial path. There wasn\u2019t much hope for advancing further.\u201cLater, I\u2019ll help you refine a Foundation Establishment Pill that will stabilize your foundation. With your work attitude, you should be able to break through to the Tendon Transformation realm before you\u2019re thirty,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cWas the pill you gave me last time really refined by yourself?\u201d Shi Feng was delighted by that offer, but he couldn\u2019t help doubting it slightly.\u201cInteresting. If I didn\u2019t refine it, then did I steal it?\u201d Long Chen was a bit irked.\u201cNo, but we originally thought it was grandmaster Yun Qi who gave it to you,\u201d said Shi Feng lightly.After all, Long Chen had completely changed in just the blink of an eye. He had gone from a trash who couldn\u2019t cultivate to becoming a Pill Apprentice. They were still surprised by this and so, they couldn\u2019t help but make up some theories.However, what Long Chen was telling him now meant that he had refined it himself.\u201cRight now, your foundation isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s not solid enough. The main issue is that at the initial Qi Condensation levels, your cultivation was a bit too rushed. This left a few faults on your foundation, so it will be an obstruction when you attack Tendon Transformation in the future. The Foundation Establishment Pill, which I\u2019ll refine for you, won\u2019t be able to fix all of those faults, but it will make it much easier for you to break through to the Tendon Transformation realm,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cBrother Long, I won\u2019t say any words for courtesy. If brother has any need in the future, then just tell me and my life will be yours,\u201d swore Shi Feng solemnly.\u201cSuch words aren\u2019t required between brothers. Whoa, what\u2019s that?\u201dLong Chen suddenly saw a dozen guards with embroidered clothes walking over from the distance. They were holding some kind of huge objects in their hands, but he was unable to see its shape.\u201cThose are the princesses\u2019 lanterns. The princesses will each hand-make one during the festival to bless the empire with luck,\u201d explained Shi Feng.The princesses? Then, he definitely had to have a good look. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know which one was Chu Yao\u2019s. As for those guards, they all marched behind a huge curtain which both faced the crowd as well as the martial stage.The festivities had yet to truly begin, so they wouldn\u2019t let the people to see them too early. Even more guards started to appear, completely surrounding the perimeter.Interested in what those guards were doing, those young people who were messing around also started shifting over.The area became completely crammed extremely quickly. Some of the women who hadn\u2019t made it in time to get a good spot actually batted her eyes at a man, who immediately gave up his spot for her.As for those men, they could only watch from a great distance. Even fatty Yu and the others could only stare from afar. After all, who had told them to go and chase after girls? All the spots closer to the stage and huge curtain were already taken now, so they could only stand in the distance.Once everyone was seated, a phoenix carriage appeared and a shout rang out, causing all the guards to kneel.\u201cThe Empress Dowager\u2019s carriage has arrived!\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 Sparks FlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeFollowing the announcement, eight ladies gracefully came out to support a woman down from the phoenix carriage.Every single person kneeled down when that woman descended, respectfully calling, \u201cGreetings, Empress Dowager.\u201dBut Long Chen was not amongst the people kneeling. That wasn\u2019t because of his arrogance or cultivation base.According to the empire\u2019s customs, cultivators above the Blood Condensation realm didn\u2019t have to kneel towards princes. However, cultivation base didn\u2019t matter when it came to the Empress Dowager. Any citizen of the empire had to kneel in front of her.The exception that allowed him to ignore this custom was his status as a Pill Apprentice. As an alchemist, he had the option to not kneel. Furthermore, he was sitting amongst a huge crowd of people so he wouldn\u2019t be noticed.\u201cAcknowledged.\u201dThe Empress Dowager merely glanced at these people before indifferently raising her hand.Only then did everyone slowly get up. Long Chen closely examined this woman who held all the power of the Phoenix Cry Empire.She only appeared around thirty-seven or thirty-eight years old, but it was said that she was actually over fifty. Despite being called the Empress Dowager, she was not the blood mother of the Emperor, but the actual mother of the crown prince.Since the Emperor had stayed in seclusion for so long, the chancellors finally decided that continuing to call her the Empress was becoming inappropriate. Since the crown prince had come of age now, he was set to ascend the throne the next year.Therefore, her title had changed from Empress to Empress Dowager.[1]With the ladies\u2019 support, she slowly walked over to the central seat and sat down.The seven princes also came out in succession, sitting beside the Empress Dowager. This was the first time Long Chen had seen all the princes together.He looked over them one by one. He had seen the crown prince before, and he also recognized the seventh prince. The current seventh prince had become much better behaved now and didn\u2019t dare to mess around as much as he used to.Long Chen finally found the one he was most interested in: the fourth prince. It went without saying that the fourth prince was very handsome. His face always had a modest smile that was very friendly and powerful.Looking over his surroundings, Long Chen noticed that many of the young women were already infatuated with this handsome prince.Long Chen shook his head at the other princes. Although they were all very grand, the arrogance in their eyes could not be hidden.Naturally, he thought of Chu Yao at this time. Amongst these princes, how many of them weren\u2019t wearing masks? Or more accurately, were they all wearing masks? And just how many masks were they wearing?A sneer appeared on his lips. The more power the royalty held, the more difficult they would be to deal with when they were corrupted. It would be better to have them lead some wars and have them feel a bit of pain along with their people.Long Chen turned his nose up at those people who had killed others in secret without actually touching blood. If they had such intentions, then why didn\u2019t they just focus on increasing their own strength through cultivating?\u201cGrandmaster Yun Qi has arrived!\u201dWhat surprised Long Chen was that grandmaster Yun Qi actually appeared at the chairs. His appearance immediately caused a commotion.This was the first time a person like grandmaster Yun Qi had ever come to the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival.As soon as grandmaster Yun Qi walked up, the Empress Dowager quickly stood up and paid her respects to him.\u201cGreetings grandmaster.\u201d\u201cThis old man doesn\u2019t deserve such courtesy from Empress Dowager.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi also gave her a half-bow of respect.After the two of them had greeted each other, grandmaster Yun Qi seated himself. His seat was right next to the Empress Dowager and at the exact same height, showing just how high his status was.His gaze roved around the crowd, and he nodded slightly when he saw Long Chen practically hiding in the corner.This slight movement of his immediately drew everyone\u2019s attention. Following Yun Qi\u2019s gaze, they immediately found Long Chen.\u201cLooks like the rumors are true; Long Chen really has been recognized by grandmaster Yun Qi. He might have already become his apprentice.\u201dSome people couldn\u2019t help but sigh. It seemed like just moments ago that Long Chen had been a bullied trash, but now his life had completely changed with grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s recognition. He had actually become a highly revered Pill Apprentice.Long Chen cursed when he saw grandmaster Yun Qi nod his head at him. As he expected, everyone immediately looked over at him.He had no desire to become the focus of everyone\u2019s attention, but now it was too late to be low-key.Long Chen rose up and bowed towards grandmaster Yun Qi. Seeing that, the Empress Dowager smiled, \u201cLooks like grandmaster\u2019s closed heart has finally been moved after all these years. Are you planning on passing down your legacy?\u201dThe crowd immediately quieted. It was rumored that grandmaster Yun Qi was extremely prideful and would never take an apprentice within his life. They were all curious as to what he would reply.\u201cThis child has a great future ahead of him. I truly do hope he becomes my apprentice,\u201d replied grandmaster Yun Qi lightly.Although he didn\u2019t exactly say it explicitly, his words still shocked everyone. He was such a prideful man that almost no one had ever heard him praise someone.For him to look so highly upon Long Chen, then just how important was Long Chen to him? Countless theories popped up in people\u2019s minds.\u201cI must assume Long Chen is an extremely talented alchemist, or an ordinary Pill Apprentice would not be able to enter your gaze like that,\u201d said the fourth prince.Yun Qi looked at the fourth prince and laughed, \u201cBeing a talented alchemist is just one part of it. The most important thing is perseverance. Fourth prince\u2019s perseverance is also very admirable.\u201dHe smiled, \u201cYou overpraise me, grandmaster.\u201dThe fourth prince no longer continued to talk after this. Long Chen\u2019s keen senses noticed that his expression had changed ever so slightly.\u201cWas it because of what grandmaster Yun Qi implied?\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help wondering.\u201cGrandmaster Wei Cang, prince Changfeng, and princess Baichi have arrived!\u201dFollowing this announcement, Xia Changfeng, Xia Baichi, and a forty-year-old, thin, bearded man wearing a Pill Master\u2019s robe walked out.His robe had an exquisite pill cauldron sown in over the abdominal area. The cauldron had three lines on it, marking him as a Pill Master.Long Chen also had such an alchemist robe, but the quality of his robe was much inferior, and there was only one line on his cauldron.One line signified Pill Apprentice, two lines a Pill Adept, and three lines a Pill Master. Long Chen narrowed his eyes; just who was this person? Why would he appear here?\u201cYun Qi, after not seeing you for so many years, it seems as if you\u2019ve aged quite a bit,\u201d said Wei Cang.The entire plaza became completely silent once he said this. Grandmaster Yun Qi was revered highly within the Phoenix Cry Empire and no one would dare say such a thing to him.\u201cWei Cang, did you finally leave the Grand Xia because you\u2019re dying and want to see more of the world?\u201d replied grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201cEven if I was dying, it\u2019d be better than my wife dying. And my wives have become more numerous over these years.\u201d Wei Cang laughed. Whether it was intentional or not was unknown, but Xia Baichi hugged Wei Cang\u2019s arm and pressed her body close against his.Long Chen\u2019s gaze darkened when he noticed that Xia Baichi was wearing the exact same clothes as the woman in the picture Yun Qi had shown him.If he hadn\u2019t guessed wrong, then this old ghost was most likely Yun Qi\u2019s enemy, and maybe even the death of his wife had been related to him.He was clearly attacking grandmaster Yun Qi and was using Xia Baichi as a sharp weapon. Fury rose within Long Chen.Although he hadn\u2019t had much contact with grandmaster Yun Qi, he knew that he was a peaceful person who was open and honest with others. He was an elder worthy of respect, and for him to be schemed against by someone like this caused him to recklessly shout the following:\u201cYou\u2019re just a dying old stick. Take care for the day that you keel over during sex.\u201dThe plaza was originally deathly silent, so Long Chen\u2019s voice rang out clearly in every single person\u2019s ears. Everyone turned to look at Long Chen in shock.\u201cYou bold peasant, how dare you be so rude to this grandmaster!\u201d Xia Baichi glared at Long Chen angrily.\u201cDo you think I care about being rude to an old pervert drowning in lust?\u201d retorted Long Chen disdainfully.Following what Long Chen implied, the crowd turned to look at Xia Baichi. Wei Cang\u2019s hand was already all over her chest.She quickly shook off the hand and glared at Long Chen. She pointed at Long Chen angrily but merely stuttered, unable to say anything.\u201cAre all your Phoenix Cry noble sons this lacking in upbringing?\u201d snorted Wei Cang coldly.Before the Empress Dowager could say anything, Yun Qi indifferently said, \u201cLong Chen is already a Pill Apprentice of my alchemist guild.\u201d\u201cDid you hear that old bastard? This lord is a member of the guild. But what are you?\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cIdiot, grandmaster Wei Cang is the chairman of our Grand Xia\u2019s alchemist guild,\u201d retorted Xia Baichi angrily.\u201cOh, so he wasn\u2019t from here; good, I was confused about that. Our Phoenix Cry land is so fertile, there\u2019s no way such a quacking old lecher could come from it,\u201d Long Chen sighed in relief.This sentence of his made everyone want to laugh, but they couldn\u2019t. But they also couldn\u2019t keep it down, so the smart ones all lowered their heads.Some people didn\u2019t react in time and actually let out a choked laugh before covering their mouth. But that was even more embarrassing for Wei Cang than if people had just outright laughed.The atmosphere of the plaza became extremely awkward. The ones who had it the worst weren\u2019t the people down below, but the princes. They couldn\u2019t laugh for fear of offending, and they also had nowhere to hide, so their attempts at stifling their laughter were the most difficult.\u201cCough, today is a holiday, so grandmaster Wei Cang, please come up and sit. The festivities will soon start.\u201d The Empress Dowager also had it hard. Neither side could offend the other, so they had to come to a compromise.\u201cFine.\u201d Wei Cang graciously accepted the offer. He coldly snorted at Yun Qi before slowly walking up to his spot. Once he sat down, he icily swept his gaze over Long Chen.Was this old stick trying to intimidate him? Long Chen extended his fist towards him, his middle finger shooting up high. Everyone gasped at this act of his.Wei Cang\u2019s face immediately turned green and killing intent overflowed from him. The Empress Dowager saw this and quickly shouted:\u201cLet the festivities begin!\u201dA melodious bell rang out. The waiting people started to illuminate the lanterns, turning the plaza as bright as it was in the daytime.A string of huge lanterns appeared atop the stage.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Eight maidens carefully supported them, and when the eight petals folded together, they created a massive lotus.Suddenly, the lotus bloomed and the center of the flower shook slightly. Only now did people realize that there was a beautiful woman in the center.The entire crowd cheered when she appeared. That was the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s first princess. Long Chen found that she really was pretty good and worthy of praise.Raising her hand, two lines of poetry appeared. The top one: the Heavens protect Phoenix Cry; the bottom one: let the Nation prosper, it\u2019s People at peace. The entire crowd burst into cheers.Long Chen smiled slightly. Being a nation\u2019s princess was also pretty sorrowful. It was like having to live your whole life as a cricket in a jar.That was a life of hidden fighting all day and night. But thinking about himself, he had also ended up in a life like that.If you didn\u2019t suppress others, then you would simply be trampled on. Being stepped on by those above you was whatever, but more importantly, they would crush you firmly to death.Whether this had to do with enmity, right and wrong, etc., didn\u2019t matter; perhaps this struggle was just the most primitive of man\u2019s nature.As Long Chen was sighing over this, the second princess appeared. Due to his absent-mindedness, he ended up not catching a glimpse of her, something he regretted.But the next one was Chu Yao\u2019s lantern. He kept his eyes wide open, afraid to miss a single detail.First, a few fireworks lit up the sky, accompanied by cheering.Then immediately after, a huge dragon kite whistled through the air.At the same time, beside the huge dragon was a colorful phoenix with gorgeous wings. Golden powder sprinkled from its wings, just as if a real phoenix had descended upon the earth.\u201cWow, how beautiful!\u201dAlong with the scattering powder, the dragon and phoenix shone, making it seem as if everyone had entered a world of legends.They slowly fluttered down to the earth. From the dragon\u2019s mouth came a large sphere of white light that burst open, sending streamers flying.From those ribbons, a beautiful woman dressed in ancient costume slowly appeared, shapely and leisurely, a beauty that made you never want to stop looking at her.The entire crowd erupted in acclaim when the third princess appeared. Many of the young men had heard of the third princess\u2019s beauty before. Hers was a beauty that could cause the downfall of an empire. Today, they finally got to see her in person, and for a moment, all that could be heard were fanatic screams.Long Chen was also struck foolish for a moment upon seeing her. This was the first time Long Chen had seen her dressed up so beautifully.Her eyes wandered over the crowd. Suddenly, her eyes brightened when she saw Long Chen, and she tossed a small ball which slowly flew out towards him.Long Chen reached out his hand to catch it and found that the ball had a small tag on it.The entire crown immediately went silent, all of them staring at Long Chen. The Empress Dowager was also startled, but she didn\u2019t say anything.But the person whose expression was most unsightly was definitely the Grand Xia\u2019s Xia Changfeng. Although he tried to appear natural and at ease, his uncontrollable anger turned his face green.The Empress Dowager had already decided to marry off Chu Yao to Xia Changfeng, but her display today of the dragon and phoenix had obvious significance. Moreover, that ball was thrown directly towards Long Chen.[1]Normally, a ball didn\u2019t have any special meaning, but that was not the same when added with the display of the lanterns. It was the same exact custom as in ancient times when maidens threw embroidered balls to pick their husband.Despite doing his best to control himself, Xia Changfeng could not stop his body from trembling and his veins popping.\u201cChangfeng, endure it.\u201d Wei Cang glanced at Xia Changfeng.\u201cDon\u2019t worry grandmaster, Changfeng will restrain himself.\u201d Xia Changfeng nodded, but his voice still trembled in a way that could not be concealed.Xia Changfeng wished for Long Chen to die more than anything right now. Long Chen also felt everyone\u2019s peculiar gazes on him.Amongst the people present, grandmaster Yun Qi was the only one to smile slightly here. Everyone else had either complicated or jealous gazes.Long Chen looked at Chu Yao and her beautiful, leisurely smile. She gestured towards the ball in his hand.Long Chen realized that it was actually a firework, so he pulled its tag and threw it high into the sky.A gorgeous light lit up the entire plaza. When the light rays faded, two phrases appeared in the sky.The Dragon swims across the four oceans; the Phoenix flies throughout the nine lands.Xia Changfeng was no longer able to control himself at all and ended up crushing the teacup in his hand.\u201cLong Chen, if I don\u2019t crush you into a thousand pieces, then I wouldn\u2019t be Xia Changfeng! As for you Chu Yao, I\u2019ll make you live a life worse than death, you slut!\u201dChu Yao\u2019s actions humiliated him even more than if she had viciously slapped him in the face.The Empress Dowager\u2019s expression was also extremely ugly. She had never expected Chu Yao to actually be so bold and express affection for a man in such a public manner.Long Chen was also speechless as he looked at the distant Chu Yao. Her pretty face was completely red, but it was still filled with determination.Tears slowly flowed out when she looked at Long Chen, causing him to feel pain for her. What was she despairing of now? Was this her way of expressing herself one final time before facing death?Seeing Chu Yao\u2019s smiling face covered in tears, Long Chen\u2019s mind buzzed blankly. He suddenly stood and roared, \u201cSeas of blood may block us, but we will never give up our path; Dragon and Phoenix will both live to old age!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s angry roar rang out in every single person\u2019s ears. His roar held an incredibly resolute determination, a willpower that would rather die than submit.Chu Yao shook, her hands covering her mouth, her tears slowly flowing. She had not had such aspirations; she had just wanted to express her true feelings once before her doom so that Long Chen understood her heart.But wasn\u2019t Long Chen\u2019s response just now just sinking himself into her own demise? She was both moved and regretful that she had harmed him.\u201cThe third princess is tired. Come and support her off the stage.\u201d The Empress Dowager was resisting her fury as best as she could.Five bodyguards came, and just as they were inviting Chu Yao to leave with them, grandmaster Yun Qi spoke out. \u201cEmpress Dowager, this isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s a good thing for young people to have emotions. Come, Chu Yao, sit beside this old man.\u201dThe Empress Dowager\u2019s expression changed; who would have imagined grandmaster Yun Qi who never participated in worldly affairs would actually get involved in imperial matters?Chu Yao rejoiced when she heard grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s words. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t save her from her doom, but she did think that he was capable of protecting Long Chen.Thinking of that, she bent down to kneel in front of him. But before she could, grandmaster Yun Qi reached out a hand, and a gentle force pulled her back up.\u201cChild, there\u2019s no need for this etiquette.\u201d He pulled Chu Yao over to his side to sit.But the strange thing in other people\u2019s eyes was that despite being at extreme odds with him, Wei Cang only looked on coldly without saying a single thing.The Empress Dowager was extremely infuriated inside, but she didn\u2019t want to offend Yun Qi over such a small matter. Without the support of the alchemist guild, then no matter how strong the royal family was, they would quickly collapse. Therefore, she could only restrain herself.But as the Empress Dowager, her thinking and schemes were profound. Her expression didn\u2019t change and she merely smiled, \u201cThen, let the festivities continue.\u201dShi Feng finally stood up beside Long Chen. Stretching, he laughed, \u201cLooks like it\u2019s finally time for me to get on stage.\u201dIn previous years, the battle between noble sons for the number one junior warrior would begin as soon as the princesses\u2019 lanterns were lit.\u201cPlease wait a moment, Empress Dowager. This old man came all the way over from the Grand Xia just to attend your lantern festival, and I brought a special event just for you,\u201d said Wei Cang hurriedly.\u201cOh? Grandmaster\u2019s event will definitely be marvelous to see.\u201d The Empress Dowager paused for a moment before smiling.\u201cThis is my apprentice who is only seventeen this year. But she\u2019s already a true and tested Pill Apprentice.\u201d Wei Cang particularly emphasized \u2018true and tested\u2019.Everyone naturally looked at Long Chen. Anyone who wasn\u2019t an idiot would understand; he was making indirect accusations that Long Chen was a fake.Most people had no idea just how Long Chen\u2019s Pill Apprentice status had been obtained. There were many people who had doubts about his true strength. Long Chen had refined pills for others to see just once before, but that had happened internally within the guild, so the outside world still didn\u2019t know anything about it. The majority of people felt that Long Chen had just managed to sneak his way in and didn\u2019t necessarily have any true skills when it came to alchemy.Due to his old status as a cripple having hanged around him for too long and how quickly he had risen recently, many people had suspicions that he might have some sort of powerful support behind him, and that support was very likely grandmaster Yun Qi.But no matter how amazing grandmaster Yun Qi was, how could he turn a cripple into a Pill Apprentice in just a short two months?A ridiculing smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face when he heard this.Yun Qi also didn\u2019t say anything. Wei Cang continued, \u201cToday, let\u2019s let my apprentice give a display of how an alchemist refines.\u201dThe crowd cheered; alchemists were extremely revered, and most of the people present had never seen the process of refining pills personally.They were filled with both great respect and curiosity towards this profession. Personally witnessing the process through which a pill was formed was definitely a great opportunity for them.\u201cBut actually, this can be even more enjoyable. Baichi can represent my Grand Xia\u2019s alchemist guild. I wonder if there is anyone from the same generation within the Phoenix Cry alchemist guild who would like to join her?\u201d Wei Cang glanced at grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201cShe\u2019s your apprentice, but Long Chen isn\u2019t my apprentice. So your little hidden challenge doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d said Yun Qi indifferently.Long Chen\u2019s heart shook; was the reason Yun Qi never took him in as an apprentice related to Wei Cang?\u201cIt\u2019s just playing around. It\u2019ll also liven things up here, so it\u2019s not useless.\u201dWei Cang then produced a see-through bottle which actually held a thumb-sized flame that was constantly burning.\u201cThis beast flame comes from a second rank Magical Beast, the Flame Leopard. Whoever wins will be awarded it.\u201dXia Baichi also looked longingly towards that beast flame. She had actually wanted it for a long time, but Wei Cang had always refused to give it to her.That beast flame also posed an extremely great temptation to Long Chen.\u201cSo, kid, do you want to come up and play?\u201dMany people were shaking their heads inside at how obvious the provocation was. Wei Cang\u2019s conduct didn\u2019t suit his status as a grandmaster.As they suspected, Long Chen was smiling at Wei Cang in contempt. But shockingly, he still spat out a single word:\u201cFine.\u201dFatty Yu and the others couldn\u2019t help gasping. Brother Long, what are you doing?In front of everyone\u2019s strange gazes, Long Chen walked up to the stage and said to Xia Baichi:\u201cYou heard your master. So just how should I play with you?\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So just how should I play with you?\u201dEveryone was flabbergasted at his words. Fatty Yu, Shou Hou, and the others\u2019 jaws all dropped to the ground. \u201cDamn, brother Long really is brother Long. Just one sentence of his can choke the whole crowd.\u201dXia Baichi\u2019s face was ashen from rage, and her eyes glared daggers at him; if looks could kill, then Long Chen would already have been turned to pulp.Grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s expression was odd, and he shook his head slightly. But he was relaxed inside; Long Chen was actually helping him relieve his own anger. Was this what it meant for evil people to attract retribution?\u201cThis rascal!\u201d Chu Yao\u2019s face was completely red. This Long Chen was too crude! Seeing Xia Baichi trembling from her anger, she wondered if she would even have the energy left to refine later.\u201cKid, must you be so boorish? The old man only asked you up here for a small competition,\u201d said Wei Cang angrily. He truly wanted to give this youngster a slap on the face.\u201cI\u2019ll stop. Do I get that if I win?\u201d Long Chen pointed to the bottle in Wei Cang\u2019s hand, sounding a bit undetermined if he should participate.\u201cHmph, naturally this old man\u2019s words are true. I definitely won\u2019t renege out of this,\u201d snorted Wei Cang.Xia Baichi finally calmed herself down enough. Gritting her teeth, she spat out, \u201cYou must be dreaming if you think you can beat me. If you lose, I want you to kneel down and kowtow to me three times. Then, you\u2019ll crawl to me and lick my feet clean.\u201dXia Baichi\u2019s voice shocked everyone. From her angry words, they suspected that there was a great deal of enmity between the two of them.They suddenly realized that Wei Cang\u2019s arrival here was definitely not a coincidence. Apparently, it was to target Long Chen and grandmaster Yun Qi.Xia Baichi\u2019s terms were far too malicious. No person would accept such a thing.Wei Cang had personally said that Xia Baichi was his apprentice, so her pill arts must definitely be shocking.But Long Chen\u2019s pill arts were something no one had ever seen before. Whether he could truly refine pills was still doubtful.Even if he knew how to refine pills, just how long had he known grandmaster Yun Qi? How much could he have learned in two months? It was unlikely for him to have gained even a superficial understanding!Chu Yao\u2019s face was pale now with worry. Although she hadn\u2019t known Long Chen for long, she could sense that Long Chen\u2019s pride had seeped into his bones. Even in death, he wouldn\u2019t accept such humiliation.\u201cLong Chen, since you aren\u2019t my apprentice, you don\u2019t need to jump into this trap,\u201d Yun Qi warned him. He was very clear that Long Chen hadn\u2019t gained his inheritance.\u201cI know it\u2019s a trap\u2026 but\u2026 the bait is just too tempting.\u201d Long Chen appeared unwilling to give up, his face knotted in contradiction.Fatty Yu and the others almost vomited blood. Brother Long, if you know it\u2019s a trap, then why are you accepting?Everyone\u2019s expressions were strange; was Long Chen actually stupid, or was he just acting stupid?He hesitated for a moment, before saying, \u201cI accept, but I have another condition.\u201dSeeing Long Chen\u2019s acceptance, Xia Baichi sneered and ridicule flashed in Wei Cang\u2019s eyes.\u201cFine, what\u2019s your condition?\u201d\u201cIf I win, I don\u2019t want to get her as a bride. With her relations with you, I\u2019d be afraid of getting a disease,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cLong Chen\u2026 I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Xia Baichi\u2019s rage was exploding. Her originally pretty features were completely twisted into an extremely frightful visage.\u201cLong Chen\u2026\u201d Wei Cang was clenching his fists tightly, the veins on his forehead bulging. Despite being calm all the way until now, he actually started to tremble in fury.\u201cOld fellow, you didn\u2019t get a blood clot in your head, did you?\u201d asked Long Chen worriedly.Wei Cang was a monster who had lived for who knew how many years. His restraint exceeded Long Chen\u2019s expectations, and he actually quickly suppressed his anger with a snort.\u201cThis pill battle will be decided with the Blood Condensing Pill. The medicinal ingredients must be prepared on your own, and you can have at most three portions. We\u2019ll start in fifteen minutes.\u201dAfter stating the rules, he returned to his seat. He had actually become a bit afraid of Long Chen. That bastard\u2019s ability to anger people was definitely heaven-defying. He was actually afraid of losing his control and slaughtering him in his fury.Xia Baichi\u2019s medicinal ingredients had naturally already been prepared by Wei Cang. As for Long Chen, he could only rely on grandmaster Yun Qi. This time, Wei Cang was using Xia Baichi to disgrace Long Chen and also Yun Qi. Yun Qi would definitely not look on without lifting a finger.\u201cGrandmaster, can you please lend me the medicinal ingredients?\u201d Long Chen spread his hands.\u201cLong Chen, you have to think about this carefully,\u201d warned grandmaster Yun Qi solemnly.\u201cGrandmaster, I did this all for myself. Don\u2019t worry, I am sure of myself,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cThen, fine.\u201d Although he had some concerns, seeing how determined Long Chen was, he merely nodded. He had a Pill Apprentice go back to the guild to get the medicinal ingredients.The Blood Condensing Pill was a second tier medicinal pill. It was a precious pill for Blood Condensation experts that allowed them to break through the minor levels and was very expensive.The ingredients to refine it weren\u2019t particularly rare. The most expensive main ingredient of it was the Blood Spirit Fruit.The pill\u2019s quality was mostly dependant on the purifying of the Blood Spirit Fruit. It had a great deal of impurities within and purifying it was difficult. If the flame\u2019s temperature increased just slightly, then it would immediately burn into ashes.But if the flame wasn\u2019t strong enough, then the impurities wouldn\u2019t be separated out, which had a huge effect on the pill\u2019s quality. It could be said that the Blood Condensing Pill was extremely difficult to refine, even amongst second tier pills.Moreover, refining in front of a crowd was even more troublesome. Although three sets of medicinal ingredients sounded like three chances, it was still extremely risky for a pill with as high a failure rate as the Blood Condensing Pill.Both parties finished preparing very quickly. Two small refining stages were set up atop the martial arena. The whole crowd would be able to see both of them very clearly as they refined.\u201cLet the competition begin. You both get two hours. After two hours, whoever has refined the higher quality Blood Condensing Pill will be the winner.\u201dWith the start of the competition, Long Chen and Xia Baichi both walked to their respective stages and placed their medicinal ingredients on top of it.Long Chen suddenly blinked. A very conspicuous plump fruit was sitting on her pill stage.\u201cA Blood Spirit Fruit that\u2019s over a hundred years old?\u201dLong Chen was startled. It appeared Xia Baichi had truly come prepared. Two of his Blood Spirit Fruits were only thirty years old, and the best one he had available was only fifty years old.\u201cHmph, it\u2019s already been said that the medicinal ingredients would be prepared by yourself. You can only blame your guild for being too poor.\u201d Xia Baichi coldly laughed at him when she saw him looking over.Grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s expression sunk slightly. \u201cEven after all these years, you still use these underhand methods.\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s words weren\u2019t targeted to anyone in particular, almost as if he was speaking to himself. But Wei Cang still coldly laughed, \u201cThe winner is the king while the loser is nothing; all I care about are the final results. It was you guys who were careless. Who else can you blame?\u201d\u201cGrandmaster, did they mess around with the ingredients?\u201d Although Chu Yao couldn\u2019t tell the age of the Blood Spirit Fruits, she still caught onto a couple of clues from their exchange.Yun Qi nodded. \u201cTheir Blood Spirit Fruits are all over three hundred years old. The essence refined from them will be extremely pure which will definitely increase the refined pill\u2019s quality.\u201d\u201cThen isn\u2019t that very disadvantageous for Long Chen?\u201d asked Chu Yao worriedly.Their opponents were already ahead before the refinement even began. Chu Yao couldn\u2019t help being worried. Grandmaster Yun Qi sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, I underestimated how thick Wei Cang\u2019s skin was.\u201dFor a moment, the entire crowd was restless. Grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s words weren\u2019t quiet, and the people nearby all heard it clearly.But grandmaster Wei Cang also wasn\u2019t wrong. The ingredients were self-supplied, so it was their own fault.\u201cDo you guys think brother Long will be okay?\u201d asked Shou Hou worriedly.\u201cWhat a joke. Who do you think brother Long is? Just watch and see.\u201d Fatty Yu was actually filled with confidence.Long Chen saw that Xia Baichi was already busy with her own refining. However, he was just standing there, not preparing his ingredients nor warming up the cauldron.\u201cHmph, have you given up? Just wait to lick my toes.\u201dSeeing Long Chen was completely motionless, she thought Long Chen had been too intimidated to continue. She raised her hand, and a pale yellow flame puffed into existence.Although Xia Baichi definitely didn\u2019t get a high ranking on the scale of personality, her Pill Flame\u2019s quality was actually quite high.She was definitely at the peak of all Pill Apprentices. It was no wonder she was so confident and dared to throw out such a bait.However, Long Chen had already been attracted by that bait. That Flame Leopard\u2019s beast flame wasn\u2019t particularly high ranking in terms of beast flames, but it was at least ten times better than his current Pill Flame.If he could refine that Flame Leopard\u2019s beast flame, then it would be of definite assistance to him. He would be able to refine the top grade Starfusing Pill that Chu Yao was in dire need of.That was because the foreign energies in her body had been there for too long. It was as if a seed had already sprouted into a huge tree. It required the top grade Starfusing Pill in order to completely refine those energies.This was something Long Chen was very aware of. That was also why he had accepted this pill battle despite knowing it was a trap. It was as he had said: the bait was just too enticing.Xia Baichi\u2019s movements were very smooth and fluid as she finished warming up her cauldron. Each step was completed without the slightest hesitation.Wei Cang smiled and stroked his beard, his eyes filled with confidence.\u201cBaichi is worth cultivating. If she can refine a Blood Condensing Pill today that isn\u2019t too low in quality, then she can be promoted to Pill Adept.\u201dThe Blood Condensing Pill was one of the requirements to be promoted to Pill Adept. If she could refine it in front of this many people, then it would express to everyone here that Xia Baichi could advance in ranks.\u201cThis is all due to grandmaster\u2019s training. Grandmaster has just arrived and must be tired. Changfeng has already found a place for you to rest,\u201d said Xia Changfeng.After saying that, he whispered in a voice that only the two of them could hear, \u201cChangfeng has also found two beautiful twin sisters for grandmaster that haven\u2019t been broken in yet.\u201dThe solemn Wei Cang immediately lit up at that, but he quickly suppressed it. In a normal voice, he said, \u201cI just need to randomly rest a bit. There\u2019s no need for such a thing.\u201d\u201cI know grandmaster doesn\u2019t want such a thing. But wouldn\u2019t it be nice of you to let the people who worship you to have such a chance?\u201d smiled Xia Changfeng.But inside he was cursing: you old lecher, your lust is something everyone under the heavens knows about, yet you still put on such a fake act.\u201cHaha, just let someone set that up. My heart\u2019s not up to such a thing,\u201d said Wei Cang.Your heart\u2019s not up to such a thing? Of course not, because you\u2019d rather force yourself on them. Xia Changfeng muttered inside for a while when his expression suddenly went rigid as he noticed Xia Baichi had begun to refine the Blood Spirit Fruit.The success of the Blood Condensing Pill was largely related to the Blood Spirit Fruit. If you could extract the pure essence out, then it would increase the probability of success greatly.Xia Baichi carefully placed the Blood Spirit Fruit inside her cauldron and slowly increased the Pill Flame\u2019s temperature. In truth, this was the first time she had refined such an aged Blood Spirit Fruit, so she didn\u2019t dare to be careless.\u201cAHH! HEY!! AHH!!\u201dWhat shocked everyone was that at such a crucial moment when the entire plaza was silent, Long Chen suddenly started to yell and shout.BANG!Xia Baichi\u2019s hand shook and her Pill Flame sharply increased, causing that Blood Spirit Fruit to immediately turn to ashes.The entire plaza turned deathly silent as they gazed in shock at Long Chen.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It sounded like an evil ghoul was demanding for their lives, causing everyone\u2019s hair to stand on end.That sound had come from Xia Baichi\u2019s mouth. She was exceptionally malevolent and sinister now; her face twisted as she glared at Long Chen.That had been the critical moment in the refinement of the Blood Spirit Fruit. She had been trying to find the perfect temperature to purify it.But with Long Chen\u2019s shocking cries, her flame had burst out of her control. By the time she managed to put it back under her control, it was too already late, and an extremely precious three-hundred-year-old Blood Spirit Fruit had turned to ashes just like that. Her heart dripped blood.\u201cHaha, my bad. My habit is to warm up my throat before refining pills. I was afraid to scare you, so I shouted several times to tell you that I was about to start refining. Truly unfortunate.\u201d Long Chen acted completely apologetic.It was intentional, so intentional. Even a blind person could tell. Xia Baichi was practically spitting flames from her eyes.But she had no way to contradict Long Chen. There was no rule which said that the opponent couldn\u2019t make noise. This time, she had suffered a great loss.\u201cFocus!\u201d Wei Cang coldly shouted, and only then did Xia Baichi slowly suppress her anger. If she didn\u2019t calm herself, she might really lose.\u201cI\u2019m very focused. No need to worry about it,\u201d replied Long Chen coldly. \u201cIdiot sister, you should continue refining. Next time, I\u2019ll do my best to keep my voice down for you, alright?\u201d[1]Xia Baichi no longer bothered with Long Chen. With an ashen expression, she took out her second set of medicinal ingredients from her spatial ring. She then plugged her ears so that she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Long Chen scaring her again.What caused him to be speechless was that she actually took out a second extremely aged Blood Spirit Fruit; her many preparations truly caused Long Chen to be depressed.And since she was already on guard against him, it would be difficult to make her fail again. He could only resign himself to his bad luck.Long Chen raised his hand and a yellow flame soared into existence. What caused Wei Cang\u2019s pupils to shrink was that Long Chen\u2019s flame was actually not that much weaker than Xia Baichi\u2019s.Grandmaster Yun Qi was also slightly startled when he saw Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame. That Pill Flame was several times stronger than from the last time he had seen him refining pills.\u201cHaha, just like I said, brother Long definitely won\u2019t have any troubles. See, he also has a flame in his hand.\" Fatty Yu was very pleased with himself.Even for them, it was their first time seeing Long Chen condensing a Pill Flame. They became much more at ease; this meant that Long Chen was a true Pill Apprentice.His Pill Flame startled many people; although they had been told of his identity as a Pill Apprentice, they had still doubted it. Seeing his Pill Flame in person put out many of those doubts.Could he really have become a Pill Apprentice in just two months without any previous foundation? They were filled with veneration as they looked at the settled and stable grandmaster Yun Qi.Yun Qi bitterly laughed inside. Only he himself knew that Long Chen\u2019s pill refining arts weren\u2019t taught by him. It seemed that Long Chen had many secrets surrounding him.Chu Yao watched as Long Chen condensed his Pill Flame. After stabilizing the flame, he started to warm up the cauldron. His movements were very at ease and his expression was calm, letting her extremely nervous heart relax quite a bit.Xia Baichi had once more steadied herself and was steadily purifying her Blood Spirit Fruit. Long Chen had an urge to shout out to her once more, but thinking about how low his chance of success would be this time, plus the shaming ridicule from others, he decided to give that up and start refining his own Blood Spirit Fruit.His Blood Spirit Fruit was only at the size of a longan and much inferior compared to the fist-sized three-hundred-year-old Blood Spirit Fruits of Xia Baichi\u2019s.Not only was the size different, but the purity of the essence within was much inferior. It could be said that Long Chen was behind before the competition had even started. This was definitely unfair.He could only do his best to discard the impurities within his Blood Spirit Fruit. In terms of final pill quality, he was already a step behind. He would have to make up for it in other areas.Suddenly, his flame exploded in strength. His Pill Flame filled the entire pill furnace and the terrifying flame gave everyone a scorching feeling.\u201cWhat a powerful Spiritual Strength.\u201dEven Wei Cang was surprised. Long Chen was using his Spiritual Strength as the fuel for his Pill Flame and had even split a portion of it to protect the Blood Spirit Fruit\u2019s essence so that it wouldn\u2019t be lost. This kind of technique was extremely wild.But after he recovered from his surprise, he sneered. It was true that his Spiritual Strength was very powerful, but his Blood Spirit Fruit was less than fifty years old, so how could he compare to the one that was over a hundred years old? Moreover, that was a three-hundred-year-old fruit.Wasting this much Spiritual Strength at the early stage meant that he wouldn\u2019t have enough Spiritual Strength to seal the pill at the critical moment of pill condensation. This was a path of failure in Wei Cang\u2019s eyes. This was clearly not an expert\u2019s way of refining.Only grandmaster Yun Qi wasn\u2019t surprised by Long Chen\u2019s action. He couldn\u2019t help lamenting at such a luxurious method though. Only Long Chen had the qualifications to use such a technique with his outrageously enormous Spiritual Strength.Within Long Chen cauldron was a pile of red powder which he took out. The powder was very red and didn\u2019t have many spots within it, letting him relax a bit.Those spots were impurities, but with his current flame strength, it was impossible to completely purify them. This was already the best he could do.Looking at Xia Baichi\u2019s side, he saw that after she had plugged her ears, she had managed to completely ignore the rest of the world and was very efficient. There was also a pile of red powder beside her.That was the Blood Spirit Fruit\u2019s medicinal essence. What caused Long Chen\u2019s eyes to shrink was that the three-hundred-year-old Blood Spirit Fruit was truly different from his. That powder was much brighter than his and had even less impurities.He couldn\u2019t help but frown. No matter how great the refining techniques he had, he didn\u2019t dare display any of them. If that scoundrel Wei Cang noticed it, he would find it very fishy.Right now, he had to take things one step at a time. If he really couldn\u2019t win normally, then he would throw caution to the wind and take some drastic measures. In any case, he definitely wouldn\u2019t lose.Refining herb after herb, he realized that over half the time had passed. As for Xia Baichi, she had already sealed her furnace and begun refining the pill.After sealing the furnace, it meant it was already finalized. Other than the final moment of condensing the pill, there were no other steps that were likely to fail.\u201cLong Chen, time\u2019s almost up. I really am looking forward to the time when you kneel in front of me.\u201d Xia Baichi had already taken out her earplugs and was coldly sneering at Long Chen.Her sealed furnace only had to maintain a stable Pill Flame. In order to repay her grievance against him, she started to attempt disturbing him.\u201cI\u2019m begging you, shut your mouth. The crap you spout will affect the quality of the air,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cYou!\u201dXia Baichi\u2019s anger caused her Pill Flame to jump ever so slightly, scaring her and forcing her to calm herself down. She didn\u2019t dare speak again and even once more put on her earplugs.She realized that in a battle of words, even ten thousand of her weren\u2019t an equal to Long Chen. Right now, she focused all her energy on the pill. She looked forward to the moment when Long Chen would be humiliated in front of her.Long Chen also sealed his furnace a short time later. The two of them were both urging their Pill Flames to increase the speed of forming the medicinal pill.BANG! A quarter hour later, Xia Baichi\u2019s pill furnace started to boom. The originally silent plaza immediately became excited.Even though they hadn\u2019t seen pills being refined before, they had all heard that when the pill was formed, strange events would occur with the pill furnace. This was clearly an omen of the pill forming.The sound became louder and louder, and the furnace started to shake violently. With a cold shout, Xia Baichi slapped her hands onto her pill furnace, her Spiritual Strength pouring in.BOOM!A huge explosion rang out and then the pill furnace became completely silent. Xia Baichi was unable to suppress her own excitement.With her rich pill refining experience, she was ninety percent sure that she had successfully refined it despite being a bit nervous inside.Slowly reaching her hand into the furnace, a dense pill fragrance swept out and quickly spread throughout the plaza.\u201cWhat a dense fragrance!\u201dMany people were surprised, and Wei Cang was very pleased. Even without looking, he could tell that she had succeeded just from this fragrance.\u201cHAHAHAHA!!!\u201dXia Baichi took out a round medicinal pill; her face was filled with feverish excitement. But due to her being too excited, her laugh sounded coarse and hard to listen to.\u201cWho stepped on your neck?\u201d Long Chen glanced at Xia Baichi and asked with great concern.Although she knew he was ridiculing her, she didn\u2019t care. She coldly glared at him. \u201cKid, I\u2019m waiting for you to kowtow to me, haha\u2026\u201dLong Chen shook his head a couple of times and no longer said anything. But he really was alarmed inside. This crazy woman\u2019s luck truly was too good. She had actually refined a middle grade Blood Condensing Pill. It was no wonder she had laughed so wildly.There was an extremely faint pill line on her pill, and although it was extremely faint, there was no doubt that it was a pill line.With Xia Baichi\u2019s ability, the probability of her refining such a middle grade medicinal pill was definitely not over one percent.Did the heavens favor idiots? Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but curse inside. If it continued like this, then he really might lose. No, he had to think of a method.At this time, Long Chen\u2019s pill furnace was also starting to shake, meaning that his pill was also on the verge of forming. He had reached the most critical moment.\u201cCrap, I must win!\u201dLong Chen took a deep breath. In front of everyone\u2019s shocked eyes, he slapped his hand atop the pill furnace and opened the lid slightly.\u201cWhat?!\u201dYun Qi was completely shocked; at this critical moment when the pill was forming, you absolutely could not open the furnace\u2019s lid! Otherwise, the medicinal nature inside would be lost!Even Wei Cang was shocked. Long Chen\u2019s actions were completely out of the ordinary for refining pills, but he appeared completely serious and it didn\u2019t seem as if he was giving up.At the same time as he opened the lid, Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength started to wildly circulate and tightly locked in the medicinal nature within the pill furnace.BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!The pill furnace was continuously emitting explosive sounds and sweat poured down on Long Chen\u2019s face. The medicinal pill within the furnace was acting like a struggling wild bull.Long Chen used his Spiritual Strength to seal it, but the amount of Spiritual Strength being used was completely shocking.Crap, I\u2019m almost out of Spiritual Strength!Long Chen suddenly felt a burst of fatigue. He shouted out, madly sending his Spiritual Strength out.BOOM!The entire martial arena shook along with the pill furnace. Long Chen closed and tightly pressed down on the furnace\u2019s lid.Only when the pill furnace became still did Long Chen finally relax. His whole body was drenched in sweat. The amount of energy he had used just now had been too great.Slowly opening the lid, the pill fragrance floated out. Looking at the medicinal pill within the furnace, Long Chen\u2019s expression suddenly changed.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shi Feng, fatty Yu, and the others were also scared.The cost of him losing was far too great. It was something hard to take even in death. But Xia Changfeng coldly smiled inside when he saw Long Chen\u2019s expression.\u201cHaha, Long Chen, what are you waiting for? Why aren\u2019t you coming over to kowtow yet?\u201d Xia Baichi sneered at Long Chen, seeming extremely pleased with herself.Being able to humiliate Long Chen was practically better than being promoted to Pill Adept for her! Her body couldn\u2019t help starting to shiver in anticipation.Long Chen\u2019s face was extremely grave as he slowly took out a medicinal pill from the pill furnace. He regretfully said, \u201cI wanted to be low-key, but the heavens wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201dOnly now did everyone see that Long Chen actually did have a round medicinal pill in his hand. They cursed at him for acting so dejected.\u201cThat scoundrel.\u201d Chu Yao was both surprised and delighted. She really had been scared witless for a moment back then.\u201cHeavens, I think I really might die. If It continues like this, then my heart won\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d Fatty Yu collapsed to the ground helplessly.Only at this time did people realize that Long Chen had put up an act. This was especially true for Xia Baichi who felt as if she had been given a slap on the face.\u201cLong Chen, you dare to play me?\u201d raged Xia Baichi.\u201cIt\u2019s just taking people for a little spin, so why are you so serious?\u201d Long Chen said randomly.\u201cHmph, Long Chen, even if you did refine the Blood Condensing Pill, you\u2019ll still lose. That pill you refined is just low grade, while mine is middle grade.\u201dXia Baichi raised her hand, showing off the pill line. All the nearby people could see it extremely clearly.\u201cSister Baichi, you really are talented. You can already refine a middle grade second tier medicinal pill at such a young age. It really does make people admire you,\u201d exclaimed the crown prince Chu Yang.A Pill Adept this young was rarely seen, maybe seen only once every few decades. Such talent could definitely go far on the pill path.Seeing her ridiculing face, Long Chen indifferently said, \u201cWho won and who lost isn\u2019t something decided by you.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to quibble? My medicinal pill has a pill line, and yours doesn\u2019t. Are you unable to see such an obvious difference?\u201d sneered Xia Baichi.\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right that yours is a middle grade medicinal pill. But the pill in my hand is also middle grade.\u201d Long Chen raised the pill in his hand.For Long Chen to put it like this shocked everyone. But after carefully examining it, it seemed as if the pill in his hand was absolutely ordinary. Although it was plump and round, there were no pill lines.\u201cMiddle grade medicinal pill? Hmph, how come I can\u2019t tell?\u201d sneered Xia Baichi.\u201cI really do sympathize with you. So young, but your eyes are so blind. Who said that middle grade medicinal pills had to have pill lines?\u201d sighed Long Chen.Wei Cang\u2019s expression changed slightly at that. Shock appeared in his eyes, and he stared fixedly at the medicinal pill in Long Chen\u2019s hand.Just now, he had felt that the pill was a bit strange. From what Long Chen said, he then thought of what he had done before forming the pill and immediately became a bit bewildered.\u201cBring out the pill appraisal device!\u201d Following grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s instructions, a Pill Apprentice respectfully brought over a large apparatus.It looked like a table and had a notch at the center for placing the medicinal pill. It had the best accuracy for appraising a medicinal pill\u2019s grade.\u201cSixty percent essence; miss Baichi\u2019s medicinal pill meets the demands for a middle grade medicinal pill.\u201d The Pill Apprentice read out the device\u2019s reading.If the essence constituted fifty percent of the pill, then it would count as low grade. Sixty percent would make it middle grade. Xia Baichi\u2019s Blood Condensing Pill had just barely made the grade.\u201cLong Chen, I truly want to know just what\u2019s so special about your \u2018middle grade\u2019 medicinal pill.\u201d Xia Baichi took back her pill and sneered at Long Chen.She didn\u2019t believe that Long Chen\u2019s medicinal pill had truly reached the middle grade. Since there weren\u2019t any pill lines, who was he even trying to trick? This was just a final struggle.\u201cThen, have a good look.\u201dLong Chen laughed and handed his medicinal pill to the Pill Apprentice. Any medicinal pills that were just refined would have a thin pill membrane covering it for six hours that could not be faked.\u201cSixty-three percent essence; mister Long Chen\u2019s medicinal pill meets the demands for a middle grade medicinal pill.\u201d The Pill Apprentice read out the new reading.\u201cWhat?!\u201dXia Baichi was stupefied to the point that even the pill in her hand dropped to the ground, her head completely blank; she had lost?It wasn\u2019t just her; everyone else was also shocked, especially Wei Cang. Reading the number on the device, his face turned completely ashen.Everything that had happened during the refining had been observed by him, so it was definitely no fake. Long Chen had actually refined a middle grade pill without any pill lines.Usually, the medicinal grade of the pill was determined during the refining process. That was why Wei Cang had given Xia Baichi those three-hundred-year-old Blood Spirit Fruits. It could be said that she had been set in an invincible position.Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have acted so grandly and used the Flame Leopard\u2019s beast flame as a prize. But now Xia Baichi had lost.\u201cNo way, you despicable bastard. Long Chen, you definitely gave us a fake. You bought off the appraiser! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dXia Baichi suddenly shouted accusations and charged at him like a madwoman. Long Chen loathed to deal with her; as long as she came over, he would send her flying with a single kick.\u201cBaichi, stop. Don\u2019t make a scene.\u201d Wei Cang grabbed her and sternly warned her. He understood that their scheme today had ended in a complete and unexpected failure.If he reneged on his words in front of this many people, he really would have no more face. So he had no choice but to stop her.Bai Xiachi struggled wildly in Wei Cang\u2019s grasp. She shouted, \u201cYou old lecher, what did you say yesterday when you played with me on the bed? Didn\u2019t you say the Flame Leopard\u2019s beast flame would definitely belong to me? Give it to me!\u201dShe mournfully shouted, her voice echoing throughout the plaza such that every single person heard it. Quite a few people shook their heads.This Wei Cang truly was trash despite his grandmaster status. Before, it was just a rumor about his lecherousness. But now with Xia Baichi\u2019s words, there were none who didn\u2019t look down on him.Wei Cang turned purple with rage and slapped Xia Baichi dizzy. \u201cBaichi has become too upset and started to babble nonsense. Take her down.\u201dAfter Xia Baichi was brought down, the entire plaza was silent. Long Chen glanced at Wei Cang and reached out his hand. \u201cHand it over.\u201dWei Cang\u2019s face was extremely unsightly, and his heart was bleeding. This Flame Leopard beast flame was extremely precious, and he really had prepared to leave it for Xia Baichi.But he hadn\u2019t expected that his attempt to get an advantage over Yun Qi would end up making him suffer a huge loss. Instead of making Yun Qi lose face, he ended up losing his own precious treasure. But in front of this many people, he truly didn\u2019t have the face to renege.\u201cTake it.\u201dLong Chen took the bottle. Inside, he saw a pulsing ball of flame and couldn\u2019t restrain from exclaiming in joy.\u201cHaha, thanks.\u201d This was the first time Long Chen felt that this old man was not bad.\u201cCan you tell me how you did this?\u201d Wei Cang was unwilling inside; this time he had truly suffered a loss.Long Chen hesitated for a moment, but seeing grandmaster Yun Qi also send him an encouraging gaze, he smiled, \u201cDue to my respect for your age, I\u2019ll tell you: this is a secret art for refining pills. I saw it in Ke Gu\u2019s recording\u2019s which included this technique. When the pill is about to form, make a small opening and use one portion of Spiritual Strength to lock in the medicinal nature and another portion to expel the impurities. This allows you to purify it twice. Now, do you understand?\u201d\u201cKe Gu\u2019s recordings? Could you mean the Pill King Ke Gu?\u201d Wei Cang was startled.\u201cI don\u2019t know. In any case, I saw it in a book. Find it for yourself.\u201d Long Chen shook his head. He wasn\u2019t telling the whole truth.In order to not draw any suspicions, he had gone through many of the techniques recorded within the guild. Within them, there was truly the technique he had described, but Long Chen\u2019s technique wasn\u2019t exactly the same.That technique said to make just one opening, but Long Chen had made two opening. One opening was used to expel impurities, while the other was used to absorb heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual energy. Otherwise, the spiritual qi within the cauldron would be insufficient for the pill to condense.If only one opening was used, then the spiritual qi would only go out and not in. No matter how powerful your Spiritual Strength was, you would never be able to form the pill in the end and would end up with a pile of medicinal ashes.Long Chen walked towards grandmaster Yun Qi and bowed. Yun Qi nodded; Long Chen\u2019s display today had completely surpassed his expectations.At the same time, he admired Long Chen\u2019s courage that allowed him to dare to gamble despite such risks. Now that Long Chen had a beast flame, his Pill Flame would become at least ten times stronger once he refined it.With a powerful Pill Flame as support and supplemented with his powerful Spiritual Strength, Long Chen\u2019s alchemy path would be completely flat and easy for him to tread upon.Long Chen walked to Chu Yao. Looking at her charming face, he almost couldn\u2019t help but sink himself into her bosom.Their display today had broken through any previous barriers between them, and their two hearts were much closer.\u201cI will definitely accomplish what I promised you. Believe me,\u201d said Long Chen quietly.Chu Yao cutely nodded. Seeing his determination, she was filled with warmth and felt as if she was no longer alone.Long Chen bowed slightly to the Empress Dowager before walking down the martial arena and returned to his own spot. He attracted everyone\u2019s gaze as he walked.The women especially had shining eyes. Long Chen\u2019s display was coarse and wild. Moreover, he actually cursed right in front of grandmaster Wei Cang. This was both fresh and stimulating to them.Then atop the refining stage, he had displayed that easy and calm refining technique of his. He had been completely unrestrained and had managed to counterattack beautifully at the last moment.Such a person was someone they had never met before. He was completely novel. When Long Chen walked past them, many of the daring ones even tried to entice him.Once he sat down, fatty Yu and the others all burst with excitement.\u201cBrother Long, you really are too strong!\u201d\u201cHaha, now that I\u2019ve obtained a beast flame, I guarantee that I will let you guys ascend to the Blood Condensation realm.\u201d Seeing their concern for him, Long Chen\u2019s heart was moved.Although he had been atop the stage, he had seen everything occurring below the stage. So, all their emotions for him were something he had seen.Fatty Yu and the others didn\u2019t have high cultivation bases. The stronger Long Chen became, the more assistance he would be able to offer them.When Long Chen had been down, these people had always stayed with him. This feeling was very precious to Long Chen.Just as they were talking, a burst of cheers suddenly rang out, and Long Chen and the others were roused. Shi Feng laughed:\u201cThe real party has started!\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was cupping his fist in all directions.Long Chen didn\u2019t recognize this young man. But as soon as he had stepped on the stage, the crowd had cheered. It seemed he was somewhat famous in the capital.At this time, Long Chen noticed that, even outside the plaza, there were countless people. Back before the lanterns were lit, there had been an area reserved only for the nobility, but now it was open to everyone.There were no restrictions on status for the battle over the number one junior warrior. Looking at where the Empress Dowager was watching the battles, he noticed that there were now many more people over there as well. Amongst them was the Savage Marquis.Those people tended to be on the older side, but their bodies were still surging with strength. They were Blood Condensation cultivators and a faint murderous aura came from their bodies. They were clearly true experts.Long Chen was sizing those people up when another burst of cheering rang out. A man jumped up tens of meters and lightly landed on the martial arena, his figure appearing extremely at ease and confident.\u201cSo it\u2019s Feng Yang!\u201d Shi Feng was somewhat amazed when he saw that person.\u201cWhat, do you know him?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cYup, he\u2019s the same age as me. He joined the army two years ago. At that time, he was just at the third Heavenstage of Qi Condensation, but now he\u2019s at the eighth Heavenstage.\u201dTo jump five minor realms in just a short two years truly was shocking to people.\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising. After joining the army, he must have gone through several missions and survived many life and death situations. This kind of speed is normal under those circumstances.\u201d Long Chen nodded. \u201cThis Feng Yang is really not bad. Although his cultivation base isn\u2019t high, that trace of murderous aura on his body isn\u2019t something these people who grew up coddled can handle.\u201dWhile Long Chen and Shi Feng were talking, Feng Yang had already taken action and it truly was just as Long Chen said it would be.Although the person who had come up ahead of him looked strong and had a similar cultivation base with Feng Yang, his true combat ability was a far cry from Feng Yang\u2019s, and he was defeated in less than ten exchanges.\u201cOn the martial path, just having a higher cultivation base doesn\u2019t mean you have a higher combat ability. Sometimes, just an unstoppable, imposing manner will make the opponent lose confidence and become afraid of you. This will lead to their battle strength going down. That\u2019s why, the further you walk along the martial path, the more you require a strong martial heart. That will allow you to overcome your obstacles and be undaunted by setbacks.\u201d Long Chen patted Shi Feng\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI know. I can die, but I cannot surrender.\u201d Shi Feng nodded.Long Chen smiled. Shi Feng\u2019s talent was limited, and his cultivation path would be rough. But if he kept a steadfast heart, he really might be able to pull off a miracle one day.Feng Yang consecutively beat three strong opponents before finally ended up being exhausted. In the end, he was sent flying by someone and had no choice but to concede.\u201cI\u2019m going up now.\u201d\u201cOh, this early? Are you able to handle it?\u201d Long Chen was a bit flabbergasted.\u201cI consider this contest a kind of training for myself. The results aren\u2019t important. Instead, I need to firm my martial heart,\u201d smiled Shi Feng.\u201cNice, brother Shi. We\u2019ll all be rooting for you from here!\u201d Fatty Yu was especially excited, and the rest of them all wanted to see Shi Feng win.\u201cYou got this!\u201d Long Chen patted his shoulders.\u201cShi Feng has come to ask advice!\u201d Following Shi Feng\u2019s shout, it was like thunder had clapped through the plaza, and the entire crowd emitted a huge cheer. Obviously, Shi Feng was pretty famous within the younger generation of the capital.Fatty Yu and the others\u2019 yells were drowned out by a flood of cheering. It was so loud that they couldn\u2019t even hear their own voices. They looked at each other in dismay and awkwardness.Shi Feng\u2019s face was dark and reserved. As he stood atop the stage, he gave people a sensation of being a large mountain that no man could shake.He was fighting a ninth Heavenstage Qi Condensation expert, but when that person saw Shi Feng, he immediately turned into a statue.\u201cCome at me; I\u2019ll only use the power of the ninth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.\u201d Shi Feng smiled slightly.That person naturally couldn\u2019t help but to become angry at that provocation. Everyone was watching them, which put him on the spot.\u201cHmph, who asked for your help?!\u201d That person stamped on the ground and a punch came smashing towards Shi Feng. But Shi Feng didn\u2019t even deign to look at it.\u201cIsn\u2019t this Shi Feng too arrogant?\u201dJust as people thought Shi Feng had a huge ego, that person suddenly sent out a second punch towards his lower abdomen; the first one had actually just been a feint.A large palm met that punch. Shi Feng grabbed onto that person\u2019s fist and started to apply some force.\u201cTime for you to go.\u201dThat person let out a startled cry as his body flew a dozen meters through the air. Eventually, he fell flat on his face.After landing, he spat out some dirt and cursed a couple of times. He turned to leave, deciding to not even look at the rest of the battles.\u201cBrother Shi is formidable!\u201dFatty Yu and the others took advantage of this moment to shout out this slogan. Following their shout, the crowd loudly cheered.These cheers contained countless young maidens\u2019 cries as well. Long Chen smiled; no wonder so many people wanted to go up to fight. This was the best way for men to attract women.Suddenly, Long Chen sensed a gaze coming at him from the seats above. Looking up, he saw that Chu Yao was staring at him.He smiled and winked at her, causing her to immediately turn red and quickly lower her head. But joy filled her eyes.However, neither Long Chen nor Chu Yao noticed that these small movements of theirs had been noticed by another person.Xia Changfeng\u2019s face was ashen, and he suddenly whispered to a person beside him, \u201cHow was your scouting? Did you find his bottom line?\u201d\u201cYour servant tested him. His cultivation base is extremely strange, and his true level could not be found. However, in terms of combat ability, he does not surpass early Blood Condensation,\u201d whispered that person.If Long Chen were there, he would have immediately recognized this person\u2019s voice as being the person who had fake attempted to assassinate him.\u201cHmph, that\u2019s good. Huang Chang, you must kill him today. Do your best not to disclose too much of your hidden strength,\u201d ordered Xia Changfeng coldly.This Huang Chang was one of his bodyguards, the man with the scar on his face. Huang Chang cruelly smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry master. He definitely won\u2019t survive the night.\u201dBang!It went without saying that Shi Feng who had reached the Blood Condensation realm was unstoppable. He defeated eighteen people in a row, filling the crowd with excitement.The last two people were also Blood Condensation experts, but in terms of combat strength, they were quite a bit weaker than him.After all, Shi Feng had received Long Chen\u2019s assistance when breaking through to Blood Condensation, so his foundation was much firmer than the others, giving him a great advantage.After defeating the last Blood Condensation expert, Shi Feng called out three times, but no one else came up.According to the rules of the competition, the title of the Phoenix Cry\u2019s number one junior warrior had already landed within Shi Feng\u2019s lap.Under the enthusiastic cries of the entire crowd, Shi Feng walked over to the Empress Dowager and kneeled. The Empress Dowager bestowed upon him a jade medal and gave him a few encouraging words.When he returned back down to the martial stage, the crowd became even more impassioned, and countless maidens surged over there, throwing flower loops over to Shi Feng\u2019s neck.Each of those flower loops had been personally made by those maidens. It was a token for the man they admired. If that man picked it up, then it meant that the man accepted the maiden\u2019s heart.Each flower loop had the maiden\u2019s name sewn onto it, so the man could easily figure out whose it was. The stronger a man was within the Phoenix Cry Empire, the more wives and concubines he would have. So rather than being the sole wife of a mediocre man, a great deal of maidens would prefer to marry a strong man who had many wives.When Shi Feng returned, his body was covered with flower loops and only his head could be seen. He could barely see where he was going.\u201cHaha, congratulations Shi Feng!\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help laughing at that comical sight.\u201cThis time you\u2019ve struck rich Shi Feng!\u201d Shou Hou was filled with admiration.\u201cHmph, what riches. Shi Feng isn\u2019t some peddler. But brother Shi, make sure to get your affairs in order when you go back. No matter what, you have to pick a couple of good wives,\u201d laughed fatty Yu.By giving those flower loops to him, those maidens had all expressed their willingness to marry him. As long as he assented and gave them a betrothal gift, they could immediately proceed to the wedding. It was extremely convenient.Shi Feng turned red and said, \u201cI was only able to do this because of Long Chen\u2019s assistance. How about we split these flower loops between us?\u201dEveryone choked when they heard that. Only Shi Feng would think of trying to divvy up such a thing.Seeing everyone laugh, Shi Feng also realized what he had said. He played dumb, causing people to laugh even harder.Normally, this would signify the end of the lantern festival. But just as people were preparing to leave, Xia Changfeng suddenly laughed:\u201cThat battle just now truly was marvelous. But I still feel as if we haven\u2019t had our fill yet. I have a suggestion, but I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s appropriate.\u201dThe Empress Dowager frowned slightly. Too many things had occurred today, and she didn\u2019t want to deal with anything else. But Xia Changfeng was a guest, so the Empress Dowager could not easily contradict him. \u201cYou can say what you want prince Xia.\u201d\u201cIn order to add more fun, I\u2019ll also send a youngster from my side to exchange blows with your Phoenix Cry\u2019s top talent. Let\u2019s compare and see which one is stronger,\u201d laughed Xia Changfeng.Before the Empress Dowager could say anything, Wei Cang interrupted, \u201cThe Grand Xia and the Phoenix Cry Empire are like a family, and it\u2019s just a friendly competition. I doubt the Empress Dowager would refuse.\u201dThe Empress Dowager only sighed in anger. They were clearly using their words to trap her. If she didn\u2019t agree, that would offend Wei Cang.\u201cThen, we\u2019ll listen to grandmaster, so we can see the grace of the Grand Xia\u2019s men. But I still don\u2019t know who is going on to the stage?\u201d\u201cHuang Chang, you go. Remember to go easy and not ruin our friendship.\u201d Xia Changfeng waved his hand.\u201cYes.\u201dHuang Chang stepped lightly on the ground, and he shot through the air like a huge bird, gently landing on the stage.\u201cGrand Xia\u2019s Huang Chang inviting any Phoenix Cry geniuses to exchange pointers.\u201d Huang Chang cupped his hands.\u201cIs this a mistake? You already look so old, yet you act like a youth? Isn\u2019t your skin a bit too thick?\u201d Long Chen fed some words to Shou Hou who shouted them out.Huang Chang smiled. \u201cI\u2019m only nineteen this year. I have official documents that confirm this, and everyone from the Grand Xia knows this.\u201dThe crowd relaxed at his words. Some people simply did age a bit faster.\u201cYoung master Long, I\u2019ve heard rumors of your strength since arriving at the capital. I truly admire you. Do I have the qualifications to swap pointers with the young master?\u201d Huang Chang cupped his hands towards Long Chen.Everyone\u2019s gaze lit up at his words, and the crowd immediately began to cheer.\u201cLong Chen!\u201d\u201cLong Chen!\u201d\u201cLong Chen!\u201dTheir shouts were surging waves that completely impassioned everyone\u2019s blood, and countless fervent glances landed on Long Chen.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could he not understand what was going on? With a cold laugh, he beckoned with a hand.Long Chen\u2019s hand motion immediately made the crowd silent as they waited to hear what he would say. But Long Chen only threw out a single sentence. \u201cI have no interest in battling with a declining dog who has aged prematurely.\u201dThe entire crowd was completely stunned; Long Chen had actually declined.\u201cThis is Phoenix Cry\u2019s number one junior generation? What a worthless person. I\u2019m really disappointed.\u201d Huang Chang shook his head.Long Chen coldly smiled. He had already jumped into one trap today, so did they expect him to jump into a second one? There wasn\u2019t even any bait this time. Did they think he was stupid?\u201cLet\u2019s leave now. Don\u2019t bother with that dog.\u201dFollowing his shout to the crowd, Long Chen walked away. He urgently wished to refine the beast flame and didn\u2019t have time to waste on this.\u201cYou actually want to obtain the third princess with such conduct? I\u2019d advise you about the toad who wanted to try eating the swan\u2019s meat. Or should I call you trash?\u201d Huang Chang coldly laughed when he saw Long Chen wanted to leave.Long Chen suddenly turned stiff. This Huang Chang had truly infuriated him now. He didn\u2019t know when it had happened, but at some point, Chu Yao had already become an extremely important part of his heart which he absolutely could not let other people trample on.But despite his fury, Long Chen still didn\u2019t want to fight with this Huang Chang. He didn\u2019t have enough assurance, so he continued to walk away.\u201cI\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d Suddenly, Shi Feng shouted and jumped atop the martial arena.Long Chen was greatly alarmed and quickly went to grab Shi Feng. But Shi Feng had gone too fast and Long Chen wasn\u2019t able to stop him before he had already jumped atop the stage.\u201cHuang Chang, clean your mouth. Long Chen isn\u2019t someone you can disgrace.\u201d Shi Feng coldly pointed at Huang Chang.Seeing Shi Feng come onto the stage, Huang Chang\u2019s eyes brightened. He cruelly smiled, \u201cAlthough you might be the number one junior warrior, you won\u2019t last ten exchanges with me. You should go down and try not to lose face.\u201d\u201cToo arrogant!\u201d\u201cDisgusting!\u201d\u201cWreck him, Shi Feng!\u201dShi Feng had just obtained the title of number one junior warrior. His strength just now was admired by countless people. For this person from the Grand Xia to insult Shi Feng was insulting the entire younger generation of the Phoenix Cry Empire.\u201cShi Feng, get down!\u201d Long Chen had already rushed over beside the stage and sternly ordered him.\u201cSee, he told you to get down. He\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll get hurt. You should go down.\u201d Huang Chang also indifferently persuaded him. But his words were even more infuriating than if he had cursed him.\u201cLong Chen, I want to test him,\u201d said Shi Feng.\u201cThis is a trap! If you fight with him, you won\u2019t be my brother anymore!\u201d Long Chen angrily roared.\u201cHe can insult me, but he cannot insult you. No matter what, I have to fight him. I can\u2019t listen to you today.\u201d Shi Feng glared at Huang Chang. \u201cCome.\u201dHuang Chang glanced at him and nodded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed that you are more mature than him. Due to your courage, I will concede if you can receive ten of my blows.\u201d\u201cArrogance!\u201d Shi Feng roared and all of his body\u2019s energy erupted. Stamping on the stage, he rushed at Huang Chang with a punch.This punch contained all of Shi Feng\u2019s power. The wind whistled and even space was tore open. Even people dozens of meters away could clearly feel it.\u201cGood!\u201dSeeing Shi Feng\u2019s imposing punch, everyone let out a burst of cheering. But Long Chen was extremely anxious.BANG!Shi Feng\u2019s fist which had seemed completely unstoppable was stiffly blocked. Huang Chang used merely a single hand to stop it. In fact, Shi Feng\u2019s entire body\u2019s momentum had disappeared the moment he had collided with that hand.\u201cWhat?!\u201dEveryone was shocked; Shi Feng\u2019s punch was extremely powerful, but it was unable to shake Huang Chang at all. Their hearts jumped wildly.\u201cJust this little power?\u201d Huang Chang shook his head disdainfully.Shi Feng\u2019s astonishment immediately became a raging fury. He sent a kick viciously towards Huang Chang\u2019s stomach, and at the same time, used his right hand to lock Huang Chang\u2019s throat.This was a double attack; the kick was sent first so Huang Chang would try to avoid it while his other hand could lock his throat. It was a very clever move.But what Shi Feng hadn\u2019t expected was that Huang Chang didn\u2019t even avoid it. He actually sent out another kick in response, and his speed was shocking; despite being the second to move, his kick landed first.BANG!Huang Chang\u2019s kick landed on Shi Feng\u2019s knee. Shi Feng felt the burst of pain there, before suddenly also feeling a punch land on his stomach.He was sent back three steps and found his right knee was broken. But before he could recover, Huang Chang had already pressed his advantage.\u201cHe really is strong. If Shi Feng can\u2019t continue, then he should concede.\u201dHuang Chang\u2019s movement was not slow at all. A hand shot out directly for Shi Feng\u2019s throat.Shi Feng quickly sent a punch to block that claw.Bang!Shi Feng\u2019s punch was only just sent out before it was latched onto by Huang Chang\u2019s hand, and suddenly, a powerful force came from it.Crack!One of Shi Feng\u2019s arms broke.\u201cAh, my bad. It seems I used a bit too much strength.\u201dHuang Chang smiled apologetically, but his hands didn\u2019t stop and another one came at him.One of Shi Feng\u2019s knees was unable to move anymore, so there was no way for him to retreat. This time, Huang Chang\u2019s palm landed on his shoulder.A bizarre force came from it, and Shi Feng felt his stomach become suppressed as if it were being crushed by a huge boulder. It became difficult to breathe.Now, he finally realized the power difference between them was too great. He wanted to open his mouth, but he found that he was unable to speak.\u201cShi Feng, if you can\u2019t continue, then you can concede at any time.\u201d Huang Chang smiled slightly, but his eyes were extremely sinister. Another palm was sent towards Shi Feng\u2019s stomach.BANG!Shi Feng was sent flying and spat out a mouthful of blood. The force was so great that he was sent flying off the stage.Long Chen lightly jumped and caught Shi Feng. Long Chen examined him and found Shi Feng\u2019s knee was broken, his arm was broken, and the last blow had split his meridians, almost turning him into a cripple.The entire plaza was deathly silent. No one had thought that the bold and powerful Shi Feng, who was unequaled just a short moment ago, would be defeated so quickly and miserably.\u201cBrother Shi Feng really is too stubborn. He actually decided to take that palm without conceding\u2026 My apologies.\u201d Huang Chang was helplessly looking at Long Chen and the others from atop the stage.But Long Chen could see his ridicule and contempt deep within his gaze.\u201cFists have no eyes. If you have to blame someone, you can only blame him for trying to show off without any ability. Not killing him is already not bad.\u201d Wei Cang shook his head.\u201cShut the hell up you old stick!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s sudden furious shout rang out, and a powerful killing intent soared, causing everyone to tremble.Even those noblemen, who saw battle all year round, felt their hearts\u2019 jump and were shocked.Long Chen fed Shi Feng a healing pill and slowly walked up the martial stage. Looking at Huang Chang, his words were like ice shards.\u201cYou\u2019re trying to force me to fight you right? I guess you\u2019re satisfied now.\u201dThe current Long Chen was releasing a surging killing intent. What he didn\u2019t know was that while he was consumed by his fury, the FengFu Star at the bottom of his foot had begun to quickly circulate.Before it was just a primal ball of energy, but now, it was gradually becoming clear. However, with the passing of time, it seemed as if it were lacking some kind of energy and slowly dimmed back down to its original state.Long Chen turned to Xia Changfeng and pointed at his nose. \u201cXia Changfeng, you cuckold bastard, just wait for me!\u201dHe then continued, \u201cEmpress Dowager, I demand a life and death battle with Huang Chang.\u201dThat final sentence of his was said to the Empress Dowager. For a moment, the entire plaza became still.\u201cLong Chen\u2026\u201d Chu Yao was panicked as she looked at the infuriated Long Chen. She had never seen him so angry before, and her heart couldn\u2019t help being pained for him.\u201cEmpress Dowager, life and death battles are grand and heroic. It\u2019s the very essence of what it means to be a man. I feel that the only right choice is to support it.\u201d Seeing Long Chen furiously demand a life and death battle with Huang Chang, Wei Cang became joyous. He would be able to take back his beast flame if this continued.That was because the loser would have his spoils taken away by the victor in a life and death battle.The Empress Dowager was in a difficult position. She looked at grandmaster Yun Qi who was also gravely looking at Long Chen.\u201cPlease help me, grandmaster.\u201d Long Chen nodded to him.Yun Qi sighed, \u201cEmpress Dowager can decide this. Since this is Long Chen\u2019s challenge, the guild has no right to interfere.\u201d\u201cThen, I permit it.\u201dFollowing her proclamation, no one cheered in the slightest. This was already not a martial competition, but a bloody battle to the death.Xia Changfeng had just been cursed by Long Chen, but he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit angry now. It was not worthwhile to get angry with a dead man.Their trap was going great; originally, they were planning on Huang Chang accidentally making a mistake and killing Long Chen, but now, they could kill him openly and resolve all their hatred.Chu Yao, on the other hand, was extremely worried. Huang Chang had defeated Shi Feng as if he were playing with a child and was obviously an extremely powerful and frightening opponent.The people below the stage who had wanted Long Chen to accept the fight at the beginning all despaired now. They were astonished that Long Chen would now propose a life and death battle.Some of the women were covering their mouths, their eyes filled with admiration. Long Chen\u2019s coarse and wild side had aroused their heartstrings.Huang Chang contemptuously looked at Long Chen. \u201cIf you had come earlier, your friend would\u2019ve been fine. How low of you.\u201dLong Chen didn\u2019t reply. Calmly standing there, frightening killing intent soared off his body.\u201cI feel like your gaze is extremely dislikable. I think I\u2019ll first dig out your eyes.\u201d Huang Chang suddenly stamped on the ground and appeared beside Long Chen like a ghost. His speed was shocking and even faster than when he had fought with Shi Feng.\u201cFuck off!\u201d His shout was like thunder, shaking the world. All people could see was a figure flying back after this shout.People looked at the stage. Long Chen was standing there motionlessly with his fist thrown forward. Huang Chang was fifteen feet away, his face shocked.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see.\u201d\u201cIt looks like Long Chen punched Huang Chang flying.\u201dAmongst the people who were discussing what was happening, fatty Yu and the others took the lead and started cheering, causing others to also join in.Long Chen didn\u2019t pay the slightest attention to those cheers. He coldly looked at Huang Chang. \u201cIf you manage to leave alive today, then I wouldn\u2019t be Long Chen.\u201dBOOM!Suddenly, the aura around Long Chen\u2019s body exploded and caused the space to tremble. His terrifying aura caused everyone\u2019s expression to immediately change.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After Long Chen\u2019s explosion, seven cyclones vaguely appeared behind his body.\u201cHe\u2019s actually only at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation?\u201dEven after so many battles, Long Chen had never revealed his true cultivation base. Many people speculated that he had already reached the Blood Condensation realm but was just hiding it.But now that he had released his aura, it was clearly just of the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.\u201cBut why is his seventh Heavenstage Qi Condensation aura so powerful?\u201dSome people were the first to realize that something was wrong. That aura was too terrifying; it definitely didn\u2019t seem to be of Qi Condensation.Wei Cang, Xia Changfeng, and the others were also very startled. This was the first time they had seen or heard of such a thing.BANG!Long Chen stamped on the stage, causing it to tremble. He charged towards Huang Chang.His fist was like a huge hammer smashing down, creating gales that filled the air.Huang Chang coldly snorted; his body shook and the energy from his body surged out, causing the space around him to twist. He also sent out a punch to receive him.An earthshaking explosion rang out when their two fists collided. Qi waves surged out, engulfing everything.Long Chen\u2019s fist was heavy as a mountain, yet as wild as a tempest. He consecutively rained down three blows. Huang Chang\u2019s expression changed and he roared, using his full power to block them.BANG! The huge martial arena that was over three hundred meters long was unable to bear the force of their power. It shattered into pieces that flew out everywhere, causing everyone to scream.With another explosion, the two of them reappeared atop the crumbled martial arena, grimly glaring at each other.\u201cI really never expected you to have this much ability.\u201d Huang Chang wiped some bloodstains from his mouth.The current Long Chen was practically a Magical Beast in human form. His great power shocked everyone. Huang Chang had been caught off-guard and actually received a slight injury.\u201cThere are many things you\u2019d have never expected. You shouldn\u2019t have used Chu Yao or my brother to infuriate me. You\u2019ve made me angry; even I\u2019m afraid of myself when I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Long Chen coldly.\u201cHahaha, how boastful. Do you really think I only have this little capability? Today I\u2019ll show a little frog like you what true strength is.\u201d Huang Chang\u2019s aura steadily climbed. Originally, his aura was only at the fourth Heavenstage of Blood Condensation. But that quickly rose.\u201cFifth Heavenstage.\u201d\u201cSixth Heavenstage.\u201d\u201cSeventh Heavenstage!\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s expression changed; he had never thought this Huang Chang had actually hidden his cultivation base and was actually a late Blood Condensation expert.The difference between the third and fourth Heavenstages was extremely great; the same was true for the sixth and seventh Heavenstages.When those huge barriers were overcome, one\u2019s battle power would increase greatly. That was the reason why the Blood Condensation and other realms after that were split into early, mid, and late stages to determine strength.Now that Huang Chang had released his seventh Heavenstage Blood Condensation aura, energy surged all over his body, stifling people\u2019s hearts.\u201cNow do you get it, kid? Your death has arrived.\u201dWith a sinister expression, a large fist smashed down at Long Chen before he even finished speaking.Long Chen\u2019s heart shivered. His intuition really had been correct; Huang Chang had been concealing his cultivation base. This was his true strength.Originally, Long Chen hadn\u2019t wanted to fight with Huang Chang now. But he had already gone mad with anger, and if he hadn\u2019t meet him in battle, then he would have been unable to accept the pain in his heart.Seeing Huang Chang coming at him with a disdainful smile as if he were just an insect, Long Chen\u2019s fury burst out again, and the seven cyclones in his Dantian were pushed to their max as he also sent a fist to meet him.With another huge explosion, Long Chen felt a huge force pass through him. It felt as if a charging bull had run into him, immediately sending him flying.He smashed into one of the pieces of rubble from the martial arena. He actually shot straight through a piece of wood at least over a foot thick and kept going for several meters before landing on the ground.\u201cWhat power! Is the difference between the mid and late stages so great?\u201d Long Chen stood back up, shocked. The first time he had met Huang Chang, Huang Chang had only revealed a cultivation base at the fourth Heavenstage of Blood Condensation.Even at that time, Long Chen had sensed that he was completely unable to block him. He had been amazed at the difference between the early and mid stages then.When he had fought the man with the long eyebrows at the Heroic Assembly House, the long eyebrowed man had not been able to fight back against him at all despite being someone at the early stage of Blood Condensation.Now, Long Chen had fully condensed his FengFu Star and seven cyclones. His combat ability was several times greater than back then, but he was still completely overwhelmed by the late stage Huang Chang.\u201cA trash like you actually dares to brazenly challenge me? How do you even have the face to show yourself? Does a toad like you really dare to eat swan meat? Don\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d Huang Chang was slowly walking toward Long Chen, smiling with contempt. \u201cA person like you isn\u2019t suitable to live in the same world as me. Let me end you.\u201d\u201cNO!\u201d cried Chu Yao. She was about to charge forward.\u201cDon\u2019t be impudent; no one can interfere in a life and death battle.\u201d The Empress Dowager\u2019s face sunk and she sternly warned her.At the same time, a dozen guards appeared beside Chu Yao. Those guards were all experts that Chu Yao would definitely be unable to pass through.\u201cChild, sit. You can\u2019t stop it,\u201d said grandmaster Yun Qi gently.\u201cGrandmaster, please. Save Long Chen!\u201d Chu Yao tearfully begged.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if I have to lose all my face, I\u2019ll definitely go save Long Chen,\u201d grandmaster Yun Qi quietly whispered to her with a smile.Hearing his promise, Chu Yao was filled with relief. Grandmaster Yun Qi continued, \u201cLet\u2019s first observe for a while. Long Chen isn\u2019t a normal person, and he definitely has his own trump cards.\u201dChu Yao nodded. Although they hadn\u2019t known each other for long, her impression of him was that he was an extremely reliable person. She didn\u2019t know why, but for some reason, he caused her heart to be extremely muddled.Thinking about what she had just done and how others had seen it, her face immediately turned beet red.Xia Changfeng had calmed down because he knew Long Chen was a dead man. But he immediately became furious when he saw Chu Yao care about Long Chen like that.He immediately shouted, \u201cHuang Chang, stop wasting time. Finish it!\u201dHuang Chang had already arrived in front of Long Chen when he heard those orders. He sighed, \u201cKid, let me give you some advice right before you die. In the next life, be aware of your own strength. You can\u2019t provoke some people.\u201dHe coldly laughed and sent a punch smashing towards Long Chen. However, this punch was completely silent. A yellow dirt color appeared over, clearly marking it as a high class Battle Skill.Everyone was stunned; he was a late Blood Condensation expert, and Long Chen was already being completely dominated without any Battle Skills. Now, that he had used one, Long Chen\u2019s death was doubtless.Some of the maidens had already closed their eyes tightly, not wanting to see the scene of Long Chen\u2019s blood flying.But Long Chen wasn\u2019t the slightest bit panicked. He indifferently said, \u201cPeople really do give good advice right before dying. You\u2019re right, be aware of your own strength. You really can\u2019t provoke some people.\u201dLong Chen met Huang Chang\u2019s fist with his own fist. Just before they collided, the FengFu Star at the bottom of his foot rapidly circulated and a strand of energy was sent into his Dantian.His slowly circulating cyclones immediately grew ten times larger and began to wildly spin.An endless ocean of energy filled his entire body.BOOM! Qi waves surged out, shaking every direction, causing the entire plaza to shake. Shocking energy swept throughout the arena.Tempests of wind wildly surged, almost blowing people away. Everyone retreated, filled with shock and terror.Such a terrifying battle was something they had never seen or imagined before. Was this really the power which humans were capable of?When the dust slowly settled, the original form of the stage could no longer be seen. It was in complete ruins.In the middle was an empty space that had originally held a very stable stone slab. Now, it was covered in spiderweb cracks.There, two people were staring at each other, their fists still connected. Long Chen\u2019s eyes were like lightning as he unwaveringly glared at Huang Chang.Currently, Huang Chang was completely shocked. Just now, he had used his full strength but was actually unable to move Long Chen in the slightest.He sensed that behind Long Chen\u2019s fist was an unending stream of energy that flowed out like endless raging waves.Huang Chang had already erupted with all his power. But was unable to kill Long Chen! It felt as if Long Chen had an endless pit of energy, causing him to feel the slightest trace of fear for the first time.Xia Changfeng and Wei Cang quickly stood up, filled with amazement. Long Chen\u2019s combat ability had completely exceeded their expectations.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression was ugly. How could a brat at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation explode with such terrifying strength? He was actually an equal for a late Blood Condensation expert!Everyone present was speechless like wooden statues. Even the always calm grandmaster Yun Qi was astonished.Chu Yao was filled with both surprise and delight. A soft feeling arose in her beautiful eyes as she looked at that figure which appeared like a heavenly deity.Fatty Yu and the others were trembling with excitement. They had been reluctant to say anything just now; fter all, that was a late Blood Condensation expert. They had really thought that Long Chen might die today.With the assistance of Long Chen\u2019s medicinal pill, Shi Feng had already awoken. But many of his bones were broken, and he was unable to move. He could only rely on Shou Hou\u2019s support.Seeing Long Chen overflowing with killing intent and appearing like a bloodthirsty divinity, his heart shook and he felt completely ashamed.This had been a trap for Long Chen. They had used him in order to force Long Chen into a meticulously arranged snare.And Long Chen had clearly known that this was a trap which could easily kill him, yet he had still jumped in because of him. That caused Shi Feng who was an unshakeable, stoic man to tear up.BANG!Long Chen roared and an unstoppable force surged out of him, pushing Huang Chang back.\u201cHuang Chang, if I can\u2019t make your blood dye this ground red, then I, Long Chen, will not see tomorrow\u2019s sunrise!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s voice sounded as if it had come from the depths of the underworld, his killing intent not the slightest bit concealed. It caused even the wind and clouds to tremble and people\u2019s hearts to shake.\u201cHmph, although you might be powerful, killing people doesn\u2019t just rely on strength.\u201d Huang Chang coldly smiled. \u201cHowever, you did say one thing right. You definitely won\u2019t be seeing the sunrise tomorrow, because tonight, I\u2019ll definitely kill you!\u201dHuang Chang\u2019s words finally caused some people to realize that this battle of theirs wasn\u2019t some coincidence, but a clear trap for Long Chen.Long Chen took a deep breath. He slowly raised his fist. No wind moved around his body, but his robes began to float up, his black hair dancing. It was as if a war god had possessed his body.\u201cThen, let\u2019s see just which one of us won\u2019t see tomorrow\u2019s sunrise!\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As soon as that light appeared, a terrifying wind shot out and even the air groaned beneath that fist.Seeing that, a gentle feeling arose within Chu Yao. That was one of the high Mortal class Battles Skills she had taught Long Chen.But when Long Chen was the one using it, it had completely changed. Its might was capable of swallowing mountains and rivers, and even from dozens of meters away, it caused people to feel an enormous pressure.\u201cBreaking Wind Fist!\u201dIt was as if thunder had shaken the heavens. A tempest surged around his fist, as if it wished to destroy the very earth.Startled cries rang out throughout the crowd. The power Long Chen had revealed had already surpassed their imagination. Long Chen was a complete freak to them.And to Huang Chang, Long Chen seemed more like a Magical Beast that wanted his life than a human. His fist seemed to expand to fill all of heaven and earth, completely locking him down.This completely shocked him. He had originally thought that Long Chen had just had a lucky encounter which had caused his physical body to become much stronger.Huang Chang was someone who had been secretly groomed by Xia Changfeng to be a martial weapon. In his youth, he had already fought life and death struggles, surviving all of them.He had a terrifying amount of battle experience, so Long Chen\u2019s previous strength hadn\u2019t been overly frightening to him. By relying on his rich fighting experience, he could effortlessly suppress Long Chen.But this fist of Long Chen\u2019s had actually locked him in place so that he was completely unable to dodge it. He could only receive it head-on.Locking someone in place like this was an extremely powerful mental skill. By using one\u2019s powerful mental force and adding it on to their attack, it would make it impossible for someone to dodge.Such a power would only appear from extremely powerful cultivators, or perhaps people like Huang Chang who had managed to crawl out from a mountain of corpses. Only they could perhaps control a trace of that power.But now Long Chen who was only at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation had actually done so. This situation made no sense to him.Long Chen didn\u2019t give him much time to think it over. His fist brought with it a tempest that broke through the space to smash right towards him.At this point, Huang Chang couldn\u2019t hold anything back. With a loud roar, a red layer of light appeared all over his body and terrifying energy exploded out. He also sent out a fist with all his strength.BOOM!Everyone felt the entire plaza shake. Then, a figure was sent flying into a huge boulder.That boulder was over ten meters thick and immediately crumbled. People looked at Long Chen who was remaining in his original position and then to that collapsed boulder. The entire plaza was deathly silent.Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression changed greatly. He had never expected Long Chen to have hidden his terrifying strength so well. This was completely out of any of his expectations.It wasn\u2019t just Xia Changfeng. Wei Cang was also filled with shock, and viciousness appeared in his eyes.If Long Chen\u2019s battle capabilities were revealed to the outside world\u2019s sects, they would definitely accept him. After all, Long Chen was still extremely young.With a sect\u2019s support, who knew just how powerful he would grow to be? That was completely unacceptable. They could not let him leave here alive!Wei Cang already hated Long Chen and wished him dead. Long Chen had caused him to lose much of his face, and the two were now like water and fire.If he let Long Chen grow further, would he still be able to live?Suddenly, the boulder blew apart and a figure slowly walked out from there, immediately causing startled cries.The current Huang Chang was an extremely sorry figure. Most of his robes had been torn apart, and his hair was completely disheveled.Through his messy hair, the crowd could see his bloody face. More blood continued to slowly drip to the ground.\u201cExcellent, you really do amaze me.\u201d Although Huang Chang was injured, his voice was completely undisturbed.\u201cI\u2019m also amazed by you.\u201d A bad feeling arose in Long Chen, but he absolutely couldn\u2019t allow himself to be oppressed by him in terms of imposingness.Huang Chang smiled. But that smile was absolutely eerie and sinister on his blood-covered face.Glancing at the distant Xia Changfeng and seeing him nod slightly towards him, Huang Chang suddenly began to laugh.\u201cLong Chen, your power has exceeded my expectations, but you will not be able to escape death today. Now, I\u2019ll let you see just what true strength is!\u201dHuang Chang suddenly let out a howl like a wild beast, and following it, his clothes began to burst apart.The people watching in the distance all let out startled screams. Huang Chang\u2019s arms had at least doubled in size and were now covered in yellow fur.The most shocking part was that his face had become even more twisted. Fur covered it and tusks had appeared on his mouth. His hands had become deformed. His fingernails grew to become steel claws, and a cold, threatening air came from his bodyThe current Huang Chang was no longer human; he was more like a freak in a humanoid shape. His whole body emitted a berserk aura.Grandmaster Yun Qi finally changed expressions when he saw this. With his experience, he had managed to recognize just how terrifying this move was.Beside him was Chu Yao who had noticed Yun Qi\u2019s change in expression. She hastily asked, \u201cGrandmaster, what\u2019s going on? Is Huang Chang a human or a beast?\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s expression was grave as he replied, \u201cThat Huang Chang\u2019s origin most likely isn\u2019t simple. He\u2019s a beast cultivator. Although he only has a superficial understanding of this technique, such a beast transformation will cause a person\u2019s combat ability to increase by a frightening amount.\u201dOriginally, this so-called beast cultivation was a kind of extremely powerful inheritance. Beast cultivators would refine a Magical Beast\u2019s essence blood, allowing them to control a portion of that Magical Beast\u2019s might.Such cultivation would only allow the cultivator to control an extremely small portion of the Magical Beast\u2019s powerful physical body. Although it was an extremely small portion, a Magical Beast\u2019s physical body was too powerful and even such a small fraction was extremely frightening.Huang Chang was very confident now. Ever since he had refined the Magical Beast\u2019s essence blood, he had never met someone who could exchange more than ten blows with him in the same cultivation level.In the last two years, he had followed beside Xia Changfeng and handled his affairs in a low-key manner. He had never revealed his true strength.Today, he hadn\u2019t expected to have to erupt with it all, and yet still be unable to handle this youth. He was completely furious.When he saw Xia Changfeng\u2019s nod, he no longer had any misgivings and revealed his unique trump card - beast transformation.\u201cSeeing the color of his fur, he most likely refined the peak second rank Yellow-Faced Devil Wolf\u2019s essence blood. You don\u2019t need to worry; as soon as Long Chen is unable to handle it, I\u2019ll go. Hmph, I really want to see what he has up his sleeve.\u201d Seeing Chu Yao so worried, grandmaster Yun Qi said a couple of comforting words. Looking at the pleased Wei Cang, he coldly smiled.Currently, the entire crowd was filled with fright as they looked at Huang Chang. They couldn\u2019t help but retreat from him. Only once they were far away from him could they feel a bit safer.Long Chen was also filled with shock when he looked at Huang Chang. This was the first time he felt the air of death, and it was extremely strong.After fusing with a Pill God\u2019s soul, his ability to sense danger had become much more perceptive. For him to have such a feeling meant that the current Huang Chang definitely posed a grave danger to him.Huang Chang looked at his own claws, testing them out a bit. Then, he turned to Long Chen, his voice so ugly it sounded like iron scratching, \u201cDo you have any last words?\u201dLong Chen suppressed his own fear. Such fear had no use at all and would only cause him to sink into despair. He had to conquer it.All of Huang Chang\u2019s muscles were bulging out. With his yellow fur standing on end and his three inch long tusks, he looked nothing more than a monster.\u201cI want to ask you a question,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cFine, it\u2019ll count as your last wish before death,\u201d Huang Chang said, playing with his nails.\u201cI want to ask, were your mother and father human or beast? How\u2019d they end up giving birth to a weirdo like you? Or are you a human-beast hybrid?\u201d Long Chen asked puzzled.The response for Long Chen was five iron claws cutting through the air. By the time he sensed them, they had already reached his chest.Long Chen was startled, and almost instinctively drew back his chest and quickly retreated.Long Chen\u2019s reaction was quick, but the clothing around his chest had been shorn and five points of blood appeared over his skin.He was absolutely astonished by this speed. That attack had been so sharp that if he had taken just one step too late, he would have died.The exchange had occurred so lightning-fast that the crowd hadn\u2019t even reacted before it ended.\u201cYour mouth really is loathsome. As the punishment, I\u2019ll tear you to pieces.\u201d Huang Chang slowly put his claw-like fingernails to his mouth and licked them. A bit of Long Chen\u2019s blood still stained them.Taking a deep breath, Long Chen focused all his attention. His divine sense was pushed to its max. Due to his carelessness just now, his stomach had almost been cut open.Just one such mistake was enough; if it happened again, he would most definitely become a corpse. This was the first time Long Chen felt such fear, but at the same time, for some reason, he also felt a bit of excitement. The blood in his body was heating up.What he didn\u2019t know was that the moment he had felt the threat of death, the FengFu Star at the bottom of his foot had started to circulate without any urging or control from Long Chen. It was currently transforming in some unknown way.But Long Chen didn\u2019t sense that since he was completely focused on the battle. All his attention was on the outside world, on Huang Chang. That demonic beast form of his was something he could not be the slightest bit careless of.\u201cA dog like you wants to tear me to pieces? Can a man who isn\u2019t even a man do that? I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Long Chen glanced sideways at Huang Chang, his expression contemptuous. But as he spoke, he was also circulating his divine sense to its limit, using it as a substitute to watching over his moments.\u201cDie!\u201dAs he expected, the beast transformed Huang Chang was even easier to infuriate. A crazed yellow gale charged at Long Chen.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he didn\u2019t understand beast cultivation, he could assume that using a Magical Beast\u2019s strength to increase one\u2019s own combat strength would definitely cause a person to become more berserk and have less control.Although that berserk strength was frightening, such a person could only fight instinctively. Long Chen believed that a wild bull was definitely a bit easier to deal with than a cunning fox.This time, Long Chen was prepared and he also moved just as soon as Huang Chang. A leg kicked out right towards Huang Chang\u2019s stomach.Bang!Long Chen\u2019s kick landed right on his stomach, forcing him back. The berserk Huang Chang was just like a wild beast and hadn\u2019t even been slightly prepared for Long Chen\u2019s attack.But seeing the berserk Huang Chang\u2019s speed, Long Chen coldly sweated. When Long Chen\u2019s kick had landed on Huang Chang\u2019s stomach, Huang Chang\u2019s claw had almost reached Long Chen\u2019s throat.Were it not for Long Chen being prepared and making his move first, he definitely would not have been able to react fast enough. This was the terror of beast cultivation. After the beast transformation, one\u2019s strength, speed, and defense would sharply rise as if becoming a new person.\u201cROAR!!\u201dBeing forced back by Long Chen, Huang Chang emitted a bestial roar. His eyes became completely red, as his claws once more reached towards Long Chen.\u201cBreaking Wind Fist!\u201dLong Chen shouted loudly and punched out.BOOM! Long Chen\u2019s fist smashed into both of his claws, and the two were shaken back several meters.\u201cWhat strength\u2026\u201d Long Chen grumbled inside, not expecting Huang Chang to have such a terrifying trump card. This bastard really had hidden himself deeply.The Breaking Wind Fist Long Chen had used before this had sent Huang Chang flying without the slightest resistance. But Huang Chang who had undergone the beast transformation could no longer even be harmed by Long Chen\u2019s fist.Huang Chang was just like a furious Magical Beast. As soon as he was forced back, he once more charged forward, wildly brandishing his claws towards Long Chen.Long Chen grit his teeth and the FengFu Star on the bottom of his foot circulated once more. The seven cyclones within his Dantian quickly whirled, his entire body\u2019s energy surging out. Two fists punched out, directly confronting Huang Chang.Explosive ringing shook the heavens and gale winds blew everywhere. Terrifying energy waves jolted back all the people watching.\u201cHeavens, what kind of battle is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too terrifying!\u201dThose people had never seen such a berserk battle. Their faces were white and their legs were trembling from fear.Even those experienced veterans were filled with shock. None of them had ever expected Huang Chang to be a beast cultivator and have such a terrifying combat ability.And what was even more shocking was Long Chen, who once had a reputation of being the capital\u2019s number one trash noble heir. Now, he was actually able to battle a monster like Huang Chang.Claw afterimages filled the sky and the wind howled, shaking the heavens. The most shocked people were definitely Xia Changfeng and Wei Cang.They could have never imagined that a small Qi Condensation newbie like Long Chen could explode with enough power to contend with Huang Chang who had undergone beast transformation.After all, Huang Chang was a martial weapon who had been secretly groomed. Out of a thousand participants, he had been one out of a dozen who had survived a hellish training.And Huang Chang was the most powerful amongst those remaining people. That was why Xia Changfeng viewed him so importantly and had spent great effort to groom him.It could be said that Huang Chang was a slaughter machine who had been trained with an immeasurable amount of resources. If it weren\u2019t for Long Chen infuriating Xia Changfeng and Wei Cang, they would definitely not have revealed such a secret martial weapon.But while they were shocked by Long Chen\u2019s strength, they now saw that although Long Chen was capable of defending, he was already starting to fall into a disadvantageous position under Huang Chang\u2019s violent berserk attacks.Currently, Long Chen\u2019s cultivation base was only at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation, and he had only established a single star. The amount of spiritual qi that he could control was a far cry from Huang Chang.He could only survive thanks to his powerful physical body. Any other person would have long since been destroyed.Long Chen\u2019s arm was once more slashed by Huang Chang\u2019s claw. Although he did his best to dodge, his clothing was torn and blood dripped down from his wounds.At this time, Long Chen\u2019s body was covered by many bloody scars, and the blood stained most of his clothing. Chu Yao\u2019s heart clenched tightly at the sight.\u201cContinuing like this won\u2019t do. The current Huang Chang is no different than a Magical Beast in a humanoid form. His strength is endless, and the sharpness and hardness of his claws would not lose out to the steel.\u201d Long Chen was astonished. Without the soul of a Pill God and the superficial battle experience that had come with it, he would have already been unable to endure.\u201cGrandmaster Yun Qi, please save Long Chen.\u201d Chu Yao couldn\u2019t help begging grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201cWait a bit.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi only continued to look at Long Chen. He had yet to make a move. That was because he was very conflicted inside. Long Chen\u2019s accomplishments in alchemy were something he admired greatly.He had once advised Long Chen to focus his energy on the pill path. With his talent, he would definitely walk far on that path.But the battle strength Long Chen revealed today was completely astonishing. As a Pill Master, he was unable to deny that if Long Chen focused all his attention on the martial path, he might go even further than on the pill path.That was why he had yet to make a move. He wanted to see what Long Chen\u2019s limit was, and also to have this life and death trial temper him.Through such tempering, it didn\u2019t matter whether Long Chen cultivated the martial path or the pill path; either would have inestimable benefits for him.Blood splattered again as Long Chen\u2019s chest was slashed by a claw. A few more bloody scars appeared upon him.\u201cLong Chen, I won\u2019t let you die easily. I\u2019ve already said that I\u2019ll tear you apart piece by piece!\u201d After this prolonged exchange, the originally berserk Huang Chang had calmed down by quite a bit and now coldly laughed.Long Chen had no reply for him. He found that the current Huang Chang had openings all over, but his defensive ability was too shocking.He had landed a kick on one of his vital points in their exchanges just now, but shockingly, Huang Chang had merely stumbled slightly before completely recovering without the slightest hesitation.After battling for the time it took for an incense stick to burn, Long Chen had already come to an understanding about Huang Chang\u2019s current state. His physical strength and endurance could no longer be judged by human standards. He would have no chance of victory if he continued on like this.He had to try something!Long Chen suddenly shouted and sent a fist right at Huang Chang\u2019s claw. But it was he who was blown back ten meters from the exchange.Huang Chang didn\u2019t immediately chase after him, and instead indifferently looked at Long Chen. He was just like a tiger examining his prey.The crowd was completely silent. The intense pressure coming from that battle was hard to bear. But now they had a slight breather.Those berserk exchanges had caused their hearts to leap into their throats. That was especially the case for those maidens who were tightly clutching their hands to their chests. They were afraid that if Long Chen revealed the slightest opening, his blood would splatter throughout.\u201cDo you have to continue this deathbed struggle?\u201d Huang Chang waved his hands, his long claws covered with Long Chen\u2019s blood.Currently, Long Chen\u2019s clothes were completely torn and dozens of bloody scars slowly continued to flow, making his appearance extremely frightening.\u201cDeathbed struggle? It hasn\u2019t reached such a point.\u201d Long Chen shook his head. Although he was covered in wounds, they were all superficial. They appeared frightening, but they didn\u2019t affect him too much.Long Chen had known that the battle today would be very difficult. It was the most difficult battle ever since he was born, but it would definitely not be the last.As long as he defied fate, the battles he would face in the future would only become fiercer. He needed that feeling of being close to death to increase his will to live.To become a true martial cultivator, you had to experience the threat of walking the line between life and death. Only by surviving the terror of death could you walk further along your path. This was something all experts had to experience.The battle just now had been fought over the brink of life and death for him. It was true that he had fused with a Pill God\u2019s soul and had merged with some of his battle experience.But just one mistake would have turned him into a corpse. He was only able to fight like this because of his firm resolve.He also had his own difficulties. If he was unable to handle even such pressure, how would he face his future enemies? How could he save himself from his own plight? How could he repay the enmity of stealing his blood, plundering his bone, and destroying his root?After experiencing the feeling of being on the edge of death just now, his intuition had become increasingly sharper and his heart clearer. Now that he had achieved this goal, it was time for the true death battle.\u201cBut if you say it was a deathbed struggle, then sure. Take a look at what my \u2018deathbed struggle\u2019 is.\u201dLong Chen clasped his hands, and a flame soared out from them. Heat waves spread everywhere, and in the end, his entire body was covered in a pale yellow flame.\u201cWhat?!\u201dWei Cang was so shocked that he stood up, his face filled with disbelief. He pointed at Long Chen and said in disbelief, \u201cPill Flame armor! How is that possible?!\u201dOther than Wei Cang, the other most shocked person would have to be grandmaster Yun Qi. So, Long Chen could actually spread his Pill Flame all over his body.Using Pill Flame to protect the body was something only Pill Masters like Yun Qi and Wei Cang were capable of doing.This not only required a powerful Pill Flame and a forceful spiritual qi, but it also required an extremely powerful Spiritual Strength as support.Only the most powerful of Pill Masters could use Pill Flame to protect the body. It was commonly known for them that Pill Masters had to reach the Tendon Transformation realm before having enough spiritual energy and Spiritual Strength to just barely use Pill Flame to protect the body.Although according to rank, Long Chen could already be counted as a Pill Adept, his cultivation base was only at the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.Under normal situations, pill cultivation and martial cultivation weren\u2019t necessarily equal, but they were definitely related.To become a Pill Apprentice required one to at least reach Qi Condensation. That was because only then could one agglomerate a Pill Flame.But just agglomerating Pill Flame didn\u2019t make you a Pill Apprentice. Only by refining a medicinal pill that met the standards could you obtain the qualifications to become a Pill Apprentice.And the majority of Pill Apprentices had already reached the Blood Condensation realm; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have enough spiritual qi to refine medicinal pills.Only extremely talented pill cultivators could become Pill Apprentices in the Qi Condensation realm. People like Long Chen and Xia Baichi, who could refine the second tier medicinal pills at the Qi Condensation realm and thus, have the qualification to be Pill Adepts, could already be considered geniuses.But no matter how much of a genius you were, you definitely couldn\u2019t condense a Pill Flame to protect your body at just the Qi Condensation realm. This undermined everything the two of them knew.Long Chen was now completely wrapped in a yellow flame. His hair drifted in the air, and his eyes were like stars, just as if a domineering flame god had descended upon the earth.\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The air several meters around him had already reached a terrifyingly high temperature.Long Chen punched out, the high temperature around his fist causing space to warp, its power shocking as it smashed towards Huang Chang.Huang Chang was extremely startled as he felt an indescribable fear from the flame around Long Chen\u2019s fist. Seeing his attack, he quickly retreated back to avoid the punch.But just as he dodged this punch, he suddenly saw Long Chen\u2019s cold smile. An enormous sense of danger immediately filled him.\u201cCrap!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s shocking punch had actually just been a feint! The actual attack was a silent kick; by the time he sensed it, Long Chen\u2019s foot had already viciously landed itself upon his stomach.Huang Chang screamed miserably. This kick didn\u2019t cause him any heavy injuries, but the flame ignited the fur around his body.\u201cAnimals really do hate fire.\u201d Long Chen was gratified inside. Huang Chang\u2019s beast transformation might bring with it a Magical Beast\u2019s might, but it also brought with it a few of their weaknesses.Furred Magical Beasts had an inherent fear of fire, so his Pill Flame had a powerful suppression over Huang Chang.Long Chen\u2019s kick had been covered with flame and ignited Huang Chang\u2019s body. A strong roasting smell filled the air.Despite doing his best to pat away the flames, it still took a long time for them to extinguish. A great portion of his yellow fur had been burnt black at this point. He appeared extremely miserable, like a rat that had dug its way out of a stove.Seeing this, Yun Qi relaxed inside. For Long Chen to find Huang Chang\u2019s weak spot so quickly was very exceptional.And most importantly, even if others knew of that weakness, only Long Chen, who could condense the Pill Flame to this level, could take advantage of that fatal weak point.Huang Chang\u2019s skin was now black, and all his fur had been burnt away. Although he wasn\u2019t heavily injured, he couldn\u2019t suppress the innate fear he had towards fire.At this time, it was obvious that Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame had completely suppressed him.Just as Huang Chang was howling in anger, Long Chen charged at him with his fists flying, appearing just like a human-shaped blazing flame.Long Chen was extremely quick, consecutively landing three blows. Huang Chang knew he would be unable to avoid them, so he could only grit his teeth and take them head on.Although he wasn\u2019t afraid of Long Chen\u2019s physical strength, each time Long Chen landed a blow, his claws seemed to shrink as if they had just come out from a furnace.After these three blows, Huang Chang felt as if his hands weren\u2019t his own anymore. He could even smell a faint scent of roasted meat coming from them.Just a moment ago, it was Long Chen who was forced to dodge and run. Now the situation had completely reversed itself. In front of Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame, Huang Chang could only cower and didn\u2019t have the strength to retaliate.Fatty Yu and the others all celebrated when they saw this. As long as Long Chen could persevere, victory would definitely be his.\u201cKill him, Huang Chang!\u201d Xia Changfeng stood up and shouted. Long Chen\u2019s strength had far exceeded his expectations.It had already reached a point where even he was feeling some fear. A Pill Adept with endless potential who was also a genius martial cultivator was not someone he could take lightly.That kind of person had to either become a loyal subordinate or be completely eliminated. Currently, his relationship with Long Chen was like that of water and fire, so the first possibility no longer existed. Therefore, it didn\u2019t matter what the price was; he must kill Long Chen or he would never be able to feel at peace.Huang Chang hatefully glared at the blazing Long Chen. He had never thought that someone he had been toying with in battle would evolve to such a level.\u201cDie, Long Chen!\u201dNow that he had received the order from Xia Changfeng, Huang Chang let out a bestial roar and suddenly, his blood and qi soared into the sky. His entire body seemed as if it were completely engulfed in blood and become entirely red.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cHe can use the Great Blood Explosion Technique?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s insane!\u201dThose noblemen of the Phoenix Cry Empire all cried out in alarm as they all recognized this technique.The Great Blood Explosion Technique was an extremely terrifying secret art. It would be used if and only if a Blood Condensation expert met with foes that they absolutely could not defeat and were pushed to the breaking point. Only then would they make such a ruthless decision and use it.The Great Blood Explosion Technique ignited the entire body\u2019s blood and qi as the price for temporarily increasing one\u2019s battle strength. It would let the user double in strength temporarily.But the price was extremely terrible. Once used, the blood essence you had condensed would be completely burnt away. Even if you lived, your cultivation base would freeze, and you would never be able to progress any further for the rest of your life.This kind of situation was rarely seen. Unless it was an absolute last resort, no one would use it. But now Huang Chang had actually used it.Grandmaster Yun Qi noticed those stunned noblemen and couldn\u2019t help but sigh. The Phoenix Cry Empire truly was hopeless. Despite such a genius appearing, none of them went to help Long Chen.No matter what, he was the son of the Border Suppression Marquis who had great accomplishments and had made huge contributions to the empire.The Border Suppression Marquis had been fighting along the border for over ten years now, fighting back the savages of the barbarian tribes and letting the Phoenix Cry Empire enjoy an era of peace.If his son were to just die like this in the capital, would the imperial family not be afraid of retaliation? But when Yun Qi looked at the fourth prince and the Empress Dowager, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh with sorrow. He leaned forward slightly and prepared to go save Long Chen.Long Chen\u2019s display today had already far exceeded his expectations. There was no way he would let anything happen to him.After using the Great Blood Explosion Technique, Huang Chang had essentially become a bloodthirsty beast and his eyes had turned completely red.Letting out a bellow, all his energy that was flowing out of his body suddenly stopped and flowed back, all of it gathering around his right hand.His right hand immediately thickened to the size of his thigh and his muscles throbbed, releasing a terrifying pressure as he grabbed at Long Chen.\u201cDevil Wolf Claw!\u201dJust as Huang Chang used that killing blow, grandmaster Yun Qi also stood up and charged over.\u201cYun Qi, don\u2019t meddle.\u201dEven as grandmaster Yun Qi moved, Wei Cang, who had already been prepared, also charged out and blocked him, punching out.Yun Qi snorted and also punched out, wanting to send Wei Cang flying.After they collided, Wei Cang flew back, but he had managed to block Yun Qi.Grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s expression changed greatly when their fists collided. He suddenly felt his hand tremble and immediately turn black.\u201cMy Yin Fiend Palm feels pretty good, right Yun Qi? Don\u2019t even think about going over with me here. That kid will definitely die!\u201d Wei Cang coldly laughed.Yun Qi was shocked inside. He and Wei Cang had fought for dozens of years, but he hadn\u2019t expected that Wei Cang would have advanced so much in the past few years. He would definitely not be able to break through his blockade in a short time.\u201cYou old lecher, it\u2019s you who will definitely die!\u201d A ridiculing insult came from Long Chen\u2019s mouth.Seeing Huang Chang\u2019s fist coming, Long Chen took a deep breath and pushed his cultivation base to its max. He no longer held his Pill Flame back at all, and it erupted like a volcano.\u201cFlamecloud Palm!\u201dThe blaze around his body disappeared, all of it condensing into the middle of his palm. The originally faint yellow flame had already given birth to a slight red color due to the high temperature.In front of everyone\u2019s stunned gazes, Long Chen\u2019s palm collided directly with Huang Chang\u2019s sharp claws. An explosion shook the heavens as the flames danced. Surging qi waves soared into the air.Even Yun Qi and Wei Cang stopped their fight to watch in shock. When the dust settled and their vision cleared, the first thing they saw was a three meter wide crater.On opposite sides of the hole, dozens of meters away, were two figures lying on the ground. The entire plaza was in complete silence.A light sound rang out as one of those figures slowly started to move. They saw that the one who slowly stood up was a bloodstained Long Chen.Although he was a complete mess, his clothing torn and gasping for breath, the current Long Chen still appeared as valiant as ever.Going around the crater, Long Chen slowly walked to Huang Chang. Huang Chang looked even more wretched, his body burnt black and looking like nothing more than a dried up corpse. There were also quite a few pieces of bones sticking out of his body.After using the Great Blood Explosion Technique, his defense had sharply declined. That was why in their final exchange he had suffered worse wounds than Long Chen.\u201cAs I\u2019ve already said, I won\u2019t let you see tomorrow\u2019s sunrise,\u201d said Long Chen coldly in front of Huang Chang\u2019s body.Huang Chang wanted to speak, but his stomach had sunk and was squeezing his abdomen, making it so he was unable to speak.\u201cThe feeling of not being able to speak doesn\u2019t feel so good, does it? Retribution really does come quickly. You made it so others couldn\u2019t speak out, and now, you can\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d A mocking smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s mouth.In order to infuriate Long Chen, he had used despicable techniques to intentionally injure Shi Feng heavily and seal his breathing so that he was unable to admit defeat. All of that had been completely captured in Long Chen\u2019s eyes.Seeing Long Chen\u2019s icy cold eyes, terror appeared in Huang Chang\u2019s eyes. He wanted to say something, anything, but he was unable to.If it had been a couple of years ago, he would never have felt any terror from dying as he had only undergone dark and sinister training. But after a few years of working under Xia Changfeng, he had grown attached to the world again and didn\u2019t wish to die.\u201cIf you want to beg, then don\u2019t bother. Someone like you doesn\u2019t deserve pity.\u201d Long Chen shook his head and slowly raised his foot.Everyone present was just quietly watching, unable to say a single thing. This unrestrained battle between giants had been full of ups and downs, completely astonishing them.\u201cLong Chen, let Huang Chang go. I will compensate you.\u201d Xia Changfeng was, of course, unwilling to see his most powerful subordinate die like this, so he thickened his skin and spoke out.\u201cOh? Do you have anything that I want?\u201d Long Chen asked, interested.Seeing there was a chance, Xia Changfeng couldn\u2019t help but rejoice. \u201cJust ask for whatever you want. If I have it, I definitely won\u2019t hold it back.\u201dLong Chen nodded and stuck out his thumb. \u201cYou really are loyal. Then, I\u2019ll give you a chance: give me your life and I\u2019ll let him go.\u201dXia Changfeng who had been rejoicing immediately felt as if someone had given him a slap to the face. He glared at Long Chen. \u201cYou were playing me?\u201d\u201cPlaying you wasn\u2019t my goal. The goal is to play you to death.\u201d A sinister smile appeared on his face.Saying this, Long Chen raised his foot, and the whole plaza was filled with alarmed cries, as he viciously stamped it down on Huang Chang.Just as Long Chen\u2019s foot was about to hit Huang Chang\u2019s stomach, Long Chen suddenly felt his scalp turn numb. At the same time, he heard Yun Qi\u2019s angry roar and without even thinking, he quickly threw himself to the side.An arrow landed right where Long Chen had just been.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he had been slightly slower, he would definitely have been skewered.Long Chen rolled several times before looking up at the arrow. Having missed Long Chen, it had ended up piercing Huang Chang\u2019s thigh.Huang Chang\u2019s mouth was wide open; his eyes had lost any spirit, looking just like a dead fish as he silently stared into the sky.A strong fishy smell came from his thigh, and despite holding his breath at the very first moment, Long Chen still became light-headed and nauseous.\u201cWhat a powerful poison\u2026\u201dLong Chen was horrified. That arrow was obviously coated with an incredibly powerful toxin. Although he was unable to determine what it was exactly just from breathing it, but from its strong toxicity, it was definitely a poison extracted from a Magical Beast that was at least at the third rank. Anyone at or below the Blood Condensation realm would die immediately from it.\u201cHow shameless!\u201dYun Qi cried out angrily and extended his hand, sending out a three meter flame spear towards Wei Cang.Wei Cang couldn\u2019t help being surprised that Long Chen had dodged his attack. Seeing Yun Qi attacking him, he hastily put away the crossbow in his hand. That poisonous arrow had come from him just now.Wei Cang also extended his hand and summoned a blazing fire sword. Yun Qi\u2019s spear continuously collided with it, emitting explosive sounds as flames shot everywhere and heat waves surged.Long Chen was the closest person around at only thirty something meters away. He was completely exhausted and weak now, so he was sent flying from their waves of qi.Just when Long Chen thought he would be smashed to pulp by the aftershocks of their battle, a gentle fragrance suddenly entered his nose, and a soft body caught onto him.\u201cChu Yao\u2026\u201d Long Chen turned his head to see Chu Yao deeply concerned with him. He rested himself into her embrace.\u201cLong Chen\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d As if a pearl necklace had been cut open, her tears began to flow down one by one. She knew that the reason Long Chen had entered such a state was mostly all because of her.If she hadn\u2019t performed her brazen display today, perhaps Long Chen wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this. He had almost lost his life multiple times just now. Her heart was filled with pain when she thought of that.\u201cWhat are you saying? That scoundrel Xia Changfeng already hated me, so it has nothing to do with you,\u201d consoled Long Chen.He wanted to stand up, but he did not have even the slightest bit of energy within him. Leaning against Chu Yao\u2019s chest, Long Chen\u2019s heart started to wildly jump.\u201cThank you, Long Chen.\u201d Chu Yao knew Long Chen was trying to comfort her. Her heart was moved once more and she felt ashamed.Boom!With another explosion, the warmth that was building within Long Chen\u2019s heart was interrupted and he quickly looked over.At this time, grandmaster Yun Qi had a long spear in his hand that had been condensed from Pill Flame. His entire body was covered in red flames. Scorching qi waves came from him, his might overflowing the heavens.That was an ability that could only be used after reaching Pill Master - Pill Flame taking shape. Alchemists didn\u2019t like to battle, but it didn\u2019t mean that they were weak.Alchemists focused all their cultivation on the Pill Flame. Not only could it be used to refine pills, but it could also be used for battle and easily overpower people in the same realm.Wei Cang\u2019s expression was extremely grave. Long Chen could tell that although Wei Cang was also a Pill Master and his Pill Flame was strong, in terms of purity, it was definitely quite a bit weaker than grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s Pill Flame.Long Chen wanted to say a couple of ridiculing insults to Wei Cang, but he was too weak after the battle. That last attack had used up basically all his energy, and he didn\u2019t even have the strength to shout.Yun Qi and Wei Cang\u2019s blazing weapons let out explosive bursts when they collided. Even the ground was shaking along with them, and the surging qi waves caused everyone to retreat.Both of them were the chairmen of their respective alchemy guilds and had exalted statuses. Even the noblemen had never seen such a battle, let alone the youth. They were carefully focused on examining their every move.\u201cWei Cang, you\u2019ve lived so long but have yet to make much progress. I think you should get lost now - Flame Dragon Stab!\u201dYun Qi shouted and the spear in his hand stabbed forward. It tore through space and destroyed the land. A dragon-shaped flame burst forth.Wei Cang also shouted and the flame sword in his hand transformed into a huge shield, firmly blocking the attack.BANG!Dust and flames surged. The world shook and it was as if the very air were set on fire, making it so people were unable to even scream.\u201cYun Qi, just wait for me!\u201dSuddenly, a figure flew out of the flames, appearing very miserable as he rushed out. That person was Wei Cang, and after saying that, he disappeared into the night.As if he had long since anticipated this result, grandmaster Yun Qi simply coldly looked on as Wei Cang rushed away. He slowly turned and went back to his seat.The entire plaza was silent. People looked from Long Chen who was being embraced by Chu Yao, and then to the ashen-faced Xia Changfeng. Nobody knew what to say.The Empress Dowager\u2019s expression was also ugly. Today\u2019s affairs had completely exceeded what she had anticipated. She, who held all the power in the Phoenix Cry Empire, was actually reduced to a minor role.\u201cLong Chen wins! This year\u2019s Lantern Festival is now over!\u201dThe Empress Dowager had no choice but to announce this result. As soon as her words rang out, the entire plaza became impassioned. The maidens were like a tide as they charged towards Long Chen.Long Chen\u2019s heart jumped in fear. Before he even understood what was happening, a maiden placed a flower loop around Long Chen\u2019s head.Just as he was about to say something, ten other maidens surged forward. No matter whether Long Chen wanted it or not, they all placed their personally-made flower loops over his head.Chu Yao laughed to the side as she watched. She didn\u2019t say anything and filled with mirth instead of jealousy. Furthermore, there was also a kind of pride on her face.Long Chen ended up covered in flower loops to the point there was no more space for any more. Just as he was prepared to tell this group of enthusiastic girls about this, the sky suddenly darkened as if it was filled with flower loops.Some of the maidens had seen that there were too many competitors in front of them, and they were unable to squeeze in. They had just anxiously directly thrown their flower loops in front of Long Chen.With one person taking the lead, the others all understood the same thing, and in an instant, there were hundreds of flower loops flying over. By the time the girls scattered, Long Chen had already disappeared, buried beneath a pile of flower loops.Martial arts were extremely popular in the Phoenix Cry Empire. And your skill in martial arts had a direct correlation with women\u2019s attraction to you. Even though Long Chen had already displayed feelings for Chu Yao, that didn\u2019t have any effect on their feelings for him.He was a handsome and powerful man, who for love and his brother dared to fight a bloody battle with a Blood Condensation expert. He even seemed to look down on death. Just what kind of courage was that? Long Chen\u2019s display had moved the majority of the undecided women\u2019s hearts.By the time Long Chen managed to dig his way out of the flower loops, the crowd around him had dispersed, and Chu Yao had also disappeared. Only fatty Yu and the others were left, and they helped pull him up.\u201cBrother Long, you really are my idol,\u201d fatty Yu said excitedly.The others were also pretty much the same. Long Chen\u2019s display had awed everyone. He was practically a reincarnation of a battle god, causing his friends to be extremely proud of him.Long Chen smiled and looked around. He noticed the Empress Dowager, the noblemen, the chancellors, the princes, and grandmaster Yun Qi had already left. Even Chu Yao was out of sight.\u201cBrother Long, while you were buried just now, the third princess was called over by the Empress Dowager. From the face she made, I\u2019d guess that the third princess won\u2019t be having such a good time in the future.\u201d Shou Hou was somewhat nervous.During normal times, they wouldn\u2019t dare rashly discuss the imperial family, but now with Long Chen\u2019s display, it had greatly raised their aspirations, and they no longer worried so much.The Grand Xia\u2019s prince, Xia Changfeng, had come to the Phoenix Cry Empire mostly for the purpose of proposing to the third princess. Although a public declaration hadn\u2019t gone out, it was said that the Empress Dowager had already agreed to it.For the third princess to publicly declare her affection for Long Chen during the Lantern Festival was equivalent to slapping the faces of the Empress Dowager and Xia Changfeng. Naturally, the Empress Dowager was irritated.This time, they had fortunately had grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s support. But as someone from the alchemist guild, he had to maintain a neutral position. He definitely couldn\u2019t interfere in the empire\u2019s affairs, especially not something like the imperial family\u2019s marriages.That was why Shou Hou and them were nervous. Hearing this, most of the joy Long Chen felt from his victory faded.But he still didn\u2019t regret it. Even if he died, he couldn\u2019t let someone like Chu Yao down.Most of the people in the plaza had left by now, and only a few soldiers remained to clear out the decorations and trash. Huang Chang\u2019s body had long since been hauled away.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll talk about it more later. Shi Feng, how are your injuries?\u201d Long Chen managed to stand up with Shou Hou\u2019s support.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Long Chen, I\u2026\u201d Shi Feng was ashamed of himself. If it weren\u2019t for him, Long Chen wouldn\u2019t have had to fight and almost lose his life today.\u201cBrothers don\u2019t need to say unnecessary words to each other. Since we\u2019re brothers, just heal your injuries and raise your cultivation base so you can take your revenge later.\u201d Long Chen waved his hand.\u201cRevenge? Didn\u2019t Huang Chang die?\u201d Fatty Yu was a bit puzzled.Long Chen smiled and didn\u2019t say anything more. The others were all startled; what was he thinking of\u2026?\u201cOkay, just help me and Shi Feng back to our homes. We have to recuperate a bit. Honestly, I feel like even my bones are about to fall apart from exhaustion,\u201d laughed Long Chen.The others quickly went to support Long Chen. In truth, his injuries weren\u2019t very severe. The problem was that he was simply too exhausted and didn\u2019t have the slightest energy.They slowly walked away from the plaza. In the shadows, a figure slowly appeared, watching Long Chen and them leave.He muttered, \u201cI really didn\u2019t think Long Chen had grown to such an extent. Could it be that he had been hiding this since the start?\u201dThat person was the fourth prince. Long Chen\u2019s display today had also exceeded his expectations.\u201cIf that\u2019s true, this kid truly does plan deeply.\u201d The fourth prince sighed.\u201cMaster, should we eliminate him in the dark?\u201dBehind the fourth prince was a figure that stayed in the dark. If he hadn\u2019t spoken, others wouldn\u2019t even have noticed him.\u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty for now. Although he startled me today, his weak points were also displayed. No matter how powerful someone is, as long as they have weak points, there is nothing to be afraid of. There were a couple of unforeseen accidents, but this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. If we can take advantage of this, we can definitely get an unimaginable profit.\u201d A faint smile appeared on the fourth prince\u2019s lips.Long Chen didn\u2019t return home that day. Instead, he told Shou Hou to send word to his estate that he was staying at the alchemist guild to study with grandmaster Yun Qi.A lot had happened today, and he didn\u2019t want to confront his mother about it for now. Plus, his mother would be worried over his many wounds.Long Chen went to Shi Feng\u2019s house. Shi Feng only had several broken bones; as for his internal injuries, they were no longer much of a problem after he had consumed Long Chen\u2019s medicinal pill.He just had to rest a couple of days to fix those broken bones. Although Shi Feng had suffered a crushing defeat this time, it would definitely be helpful in letting him mature. Experts needed to be tempered.Shi Feng\u2019s father set up a quiet room for Long Chen. By the time they arrived, Long Chen had recovered a bit of his energy.The others all said their goodbyes. After that, Long Chen slowly took out a jade bottle from his storage ring that had a burning fluctuation inside.\u201cHehe, I can\u2019t wait till tomorrow for this!\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 Refining the Beast FlamePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeLong Chen examined the jade bottle in his hand. Inside was a ball of liquid, yet it released a scorching heat.He knew that this ball of warm liquid was the beast flame. That was the essence of a Magical Beast\u2019s flame.Beast flames were exceptionally precious. A beast flame was equivalent to a Magical Beast\u2019s life, and only second rank or higher Magical Beasts had the ability to nourish a beast flame.Long Chen used his divine sense to examine the beast flame. The flame element inside was extremely dense, and according to Long Chen\u2019s memories, this beast flame was probably from a peak second rank Magical Beast. It was no wonder Wei Cang\u2019s expression had been so extremely ugly when he had handed over the beast flame.His Pill Flame spread and enveloped his whole body. Opening the jade bottle, he swallowed the ball of beast flame essence.BOOM!When Long Chen swallowed it, its original appearance of a ball of liquid changed. It went from being as gentle as a rabbit to a berserk beast.A beast flame was a Magical Beast\u2019s life essence. It contained the berserk nature of the Magical Beast, and for a normal pill cultivator to force it to surrender required a great deal of time to grind down the berserk willpower.Only when that berserk willpower was ground down could you use your Pill Flame to join with the beast flame and slowly make it give up its resistance, gradually refining it one step at a time.But Long Chen wasn\u2019t the same. The battle today had made him disclose every single one of his hidden trump cards in order to come out on top. He needed some stronger ones to protect his life.Xia Changfeng had lost his most trusted lieutenant, and Wei Cang had lost his beast flame. They wouldn\u2019t take that lying down.The only person who Long Chen could rely on in the imperial capital was grandmaster Yun Qi, but as the chairman of the alchemist guild, he couldn\u2019t interfere directly with the empire\u2019s struggles.Unless Long Chen completely gave himself to the guild and no longer participated in the empire\u2019s affairs, Yun Qi wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. But after being repressed for so many years, how could Long Chen be willing to give up on finding out who was the villain hiding the shadows that had tormented him for so long?And how could he possibly abandon Chu Yao? Chu Yao had also endured such bitter experiences, making him think of his own troubles. Was the person who had secretly schemed against Chu Yao also the one who had stolen his Spirit Root?Before everything became clear, Long Chen couldn\u2019t give her or his own enmity up. He couldn\u2019t just swallow this hatred. So, his time was extremely limited, and he could only use the most violent and direct method to refine the beast flame.BOOM! Another explosion came from within Long Chen\u2019s body. After the beast flame entered his stomach, it transformed into the shape of a vicious leopard\u2019s head that was fighting as hard as it could. A terrifyingly high temperature almost burnt Long Chen to a crisp.When beast flames were extracted, they shouldn\u2019t be suppressed. Doing so would weaken them, causing their quality to decline.Long Chen was now basically facing a peak second rank Magical Beast flame\u2019s roasting. The berserk energy caused Long Chen to spit out blood.As soon as that blood was spat out, it turned to vapor. Long Chen\u2019s body had already been turned into a burning stove.\u201cHmph, a small second rank Magical Beast also dares to resist me?\u201dLong Chen snorted and his FengFu Star activated; the seven cyclones revolved wildly, and his entire flame energy was like a giant net that forcefully enveloped the ball of beast flame.That beast flame now entered its most violent state, but Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame ended up becoming incomparably firm and forceful with the support of the FengFu Star and the larger seven cyclones.In the beginning, that beast flame was capable of dashing around, but in just a few breaths\u2019 time, it became just like a captured beast, and no matter how it struggled, it was useless.After all, that ball of beast flame didn\u2019t have any further energy as support. Under Long Chen\u2019s full effort, its violent aura was gradually eroded and it slowly calmed down.Although Long Chen had already anticipated this result, he still sighed a breath of relief. His clothes were now drenched with sweat.At this time, he felt as if his personality was split. Part of him was filled with contempt for this beast flame; the other part of him greatly looked forward to it. One side was happy, while the other felt disdain.Long Chen bitterly laughed. He knew that he had fused with a Pill God\u2019s soul, and naturally, that Pill God looked down on such a beast flame.But it was what he needed urgently. This beast flame was the first step of his pill path.Under Long Chen\u2019s continuous refining, the beast flame gradually became completely calm, as calm as a ball of water. It was extremely docile now that it was completely purified, its berserk nature all refined away.An ordinary pill cultivator\u2019s first flame was actually created by using the Dantian\u2019s spiritual qi to follow specific paths and be released outside as a high temperature.Such a flame was more accurately a kind of hot gas. Only those who could form this gas had the potential to be pill cultivators.Less than one in a thousand people could do this, so pill cultivators were extremely rare. But some people had a special Dantian that already possessed a trace of flame energy. Through training, it could be condensed into Pill Flame. That was a true Pill Flame.But such people weren\u2019t one in a thousand, but less than one in a million. So amongst pill cultivators, most of them were like Long Chen, and for them to advance, it required refining a beast flame as a start.Even so, beast flames were extremely precious and could not be measured in terms of just gold coins. Perhaps in all of Phoenix Cry, only Yun Qi possessed a beast flame.Slowly withdrawing his flames back into his body, Long Chen examined the ball of beast flame that was now docile in his body and couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit embarrassed.When most pill cultivators finished refining a beast flame, they would let it merge into their Dantian and use the beast flame as their only cultivation path.But Long Chen couldn\u2019t do so. For one thing, the main source of his spiritual qi was not in his Dantian but his FengFu Star.Furthermore, he cultivated in the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, and this technique was extremely mysterious and powerful. It allowed him to fight people several levels above him. There was no way he could give it up to only follow pill cultivation.\u201cI got it!\u201d Long Chen suddenly thought of an idea and placed the beast flame into his Dantian, using the seven cyclones to slowly envelop it.\u201cLet\u2019s try it out.\u201dTaking a deep breath, he started a very audacious test. He used his cyclones to slowly absorb the beast flame.That beast flame didn\u2019t have any resistance to the absorption. Following Long Chen\u2019s orders, it dissolved into the meridians all around his body.This was merging the flame:; dissolve the beast flame, and send it throughout the entire body. This was the best way for him to become familiar with the beast flame and gain greater control.Since it had already been completely refined, this process occurred extremely easily. Just like that, the beast flame dispersed throughout his meridians.This method of his had definitely never been used before. Even in his Pill God memories, there was no mention of such a thing.After dissolving the beast flame throughout his meridians, Long Chen was pleasantly surprised to find that his meridians had actually become a bit wider.That additional widening could not be underestimated. Each meridian was like a canal. The wider the canal was, the greater the amount of spiritual qi it could support during battle, allowing you to explode with greater power.The Dantian could be likened to a lake while the meridians would be the channels. During a battle, you needed to draw the lake\u2019s water throughout the channels before converging them back together. This was also how Battle Skills could be so explosive.But the more powerful the Battle Skill, the greater the amount of energy required. If the channels\u2019 capacities were insufficient, they would burst. Without even harming your enemy, your meridians would break down.That was also why he was still unable to use Split the Heavens despite having figured out how to. It was because his meridians weren\u2019t wide enough.His test today almost made him jump with excitement. He now used his own meridians as carriers to nourish the beast flame, the two of them complementing and assisting each other.As he cultivated and became stronger, his meridians would be constantly enlarged by the beast flame. Long Chen had truly profited this time.Although other pill cultivators who brought the beast flame to the Dantian would be able to cultivate quicker, that wasn\u2019t even comparable to the benefit of having wider meridians.\u201cOkay, I still have to see whether this is all good or bad.\u201dTaking a deep breath and praying inside, he slowly collected the beast flame that had merged into his meridians back into his Dantian.A flame appeared in the middle of his palm. It had a light red color, and as soon as it appeared, it caused the air around it to twist.He nodded pleased. It already had this much strength just after refining it. It truly was worthy of being a beast flame; it was many times stronger than his original flame.Hesitating for a moment, he gritted his teeth and slowly circulated a small strand of spiritual qi from his FengFu Star to his cyclones.The slowly revolving cyclones immediately grew larger and began to wildly spin.\u201cI wonder if this will work\u2026\u201dLong Chen was worriedly looking at the flame in his hand. He was extremely nervous about this experiment.But he still decided to carry it out. He sent those seven cyclones\u2019 energy to the ball of flame that he had condensed.Long Chen felt his body jolt as if it were about to explode. The blaze in his hand that was originally one foot long immediately grew to ten feet.\u201cCrap!\u201dAlarmed, Long Chen hastily took back the flame.That eruption of his Pill Flame immediately scorched the roof.Flapping his hand, he created a wind to put out the flame. But although the flame was extinguished, the entire roof was also sent flying.Looking up at the three-sixty panoramic view he had of the starry sky, Long Chen felt the urge to cry. Almost as soon as he had come to a friend\u2019s house, he had ended up not burning the house down, but actually tearing it apart! That wasn\u2019t good\u2026As expected, footsteps came running as the people from the Shi household were all alarmed. Even someone deaf would have been awoken from the clamor.Seeing Long Chen\u2019s embarrassed face, Shi Feng\u2019s father covered up his shock and smiled. Without saying anything to him, he told someone to prepare a new room for him.Long Chen wanted to say something, but Shi Feng\u2019s father just patted him on the shoulder and laughed, \u201cYou and Shi Feng are brothers, so just treat this place like your own home.\u201dAfter a new room was arranged for him, Long Chen didn\u2019t dare further experiment with anything he didn\u2019t understand. Sitting on the bed, he started to use his cyclones to absorb the world\u2019s spiritual qi, sending it into his FengFu Star.The next day before the sun had even arisen, Long Chen\u2019s body suddenly emitted an explosive sound.Long Chen slowly opened his eyes happily. After his battle with Huang Chang, the next bottleneck had slackened, allowing him now to reach the eighth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.He ate breakfast and examined Shi Feng. He saw that Shi Feng didn\u2019t have any serious sequelae and left two medicinal pills for him. After that, Long Chen left the Shi household and went directly to the alchemist guild.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His expression was extremely malevolent now as he ground his teeth.\u201cLong Chen, Long Chen, if I don\u2019t tear your body into a thousand pieces, then I wouldn\u2019t be Xia Changfeng!\u201dThe Lantern Festival had been a complete and utter failure for him. He had lost a powerful subordinate in Huang Chang, making him incessantly furious.It had turned out completely different from what he had planned. Not only had he failed to kill Long Chen, but he had also lost Huang Chang, and Wei Cang had had to hand over his precious beast flame.This competition\u2019s greatest winner had actually been Long Chen. Xia Changfeng\u2019s lungs were about to burst from anger.Within the same room as him was a young man in his twenties. Acting as if he didn\u2019t even notice Xia Changfeng\u2019s anger, he leisurely drank a cup of tea to the side.Xia Changfeng\u2019s anger had been mostly vented after breaking the table, and he gradually calmed down. He respectfully said to that person, \u201cBrother Luo, Long Chen is too overbearing. I hope that brother Luo can help me relieve some of my anger.\u201dThat white-robed man who had been called brother Luo lightly put down his cup and indifferently said, \u201cChangfeng, you really have disappointed me. Just a woman has caused you to lose your calm. That Long Chen is just an ant. You have to remember why we\u2019ve come to Phoenix Cry this time. If such a small trivial matter ends up delaying the major event, don\u2019t even think about escaping your punishment. Do you understand?\u201dAfter saying this, his expression sunk, showing how displeased he was with Xia Changfeng\u2019s performance.Being reminded about their goal in coming here, sweat rolled down Xia Changfeng\u2019s forehead.\u201cMany thanks for the reminder brother Luo. Changfeng understands his wrong.\u201d Xia Changfeng hastily bowed.Seeing Xia Changfeng\u2019s apology, the white-robed man smiled slightly. \u201cBefore we accomplish that matter, waiting patiently is the most important thing. Must you squabble over temporary losses? Moreover, we\u2019ve already spent many years preparing. In the end, that third princess will be yours. Think about it; seeing that kid Long Chen work bitterly for a long time just to still fail at the end, wouldn\u2019t that the most refreshing?\u201dXia Changfeng\u2019s eyes brightened, and his anger was immediately relieved. \u201cIt really is brother Luo whose vision is far-reaching. I am ashamed.\u201d\u201cYou mixed up your priorities. Although, to tell the truth, that Chu Yao really is as beautiful as a goddess and irresistible. Chu Yao\u2019s maidenhood will be yours. But once you obtain that beautiful woman, can you also let your big brother have a taste?\u201d The white-robed man looked at Xia Changfeng and smiled.Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression changed slightly, but he immediately covered it up and did his absolute best to be indifferent. He smiled, \u201cChangfeng doesn\u2019t really care about such a beauty. Once the matter is over, brother Luo will, of course, have his share.\u201d\u201cChangfeng, you aren\u2019t feeling unwell inside, are you?\u201d The white-robed man lifted his teacup and blew on it.\u201cHow could that be possible? Brother Luo is from the sect, and this little brother is still hoping to have brother Luo\u2019s guidance in the future,\u201d said Xia Changfeng hastily.\u201cGood, that is how a man should act. Take what comes magnanimously. Otherwise, how will you ever accomplish big things? Don\u2019t worry; as long as this matter is handled properly, you will definitely be able to become an outer disciple.\u201d\u201cThen, many thanks brother Luo.\u201d Xia Changfeng was ecstatic at that. That unhappiness he had felt just now vanished into smoke.The white-robed man nodded. \u201cBut you must handle this with utmost care. If even the slightest whiff of it comes out, not only will the benefits fly away, but the punishment we\u2019ll get is not something either of us can survive.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry brother Luo, I\u2019ve been extremely focused on it and will definitely handle it properly.\u201d Xia Changfeng patted his chest.\u201cThen, that\u2019s good. My identity can\u2019t be found out, so you can only call me out at the end. Proceed with the plan faster and set up everything as early as possible. The less movements you make, the better. And it would be best for it to be handled without spilling any blood.\u201d\u201cMost of the plan has already been set in order. The entire Phoenix Cry Empire is basically within our control. There\u2019s just one big problem: the Border Suppression Marquis, Long Tianxiao. He still won\u2019t surrender and is unmoved by force or persuasion. It really is a headache. He controls almost a third of the forces within the empire, and if we can\u2019t resolve this problem, it might have an effect on our plan,\u201d said Xia Changfeng.\u201cLong Tianxiao? Long Chen? How are they related?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re father and son.\u201d\u201cIdiot, he\u2019s the Border Suppression Marquis\u2019s son? Then just treat him as a kind of trump card, a trump card that controls the Border Suppression Marquis! And you actually wanted to kill him?\u201d The white-robed man abruptly became furious.Xia Changfeng was at a loss. He also knew that Long Chen could be a kind of trump card for them, but he was unable to bear Long Chen\u2019s flirtation with Chu Yao.\u201cYou almost ruined things! Don\u2019t touch Long Chen for now. Go find all the information about him and his family for me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXia Changfeng left. Once he left, the white-robed man coldly spat out, \u201cWhat an idiot.\u201d\u2026When Long Chen arrived at the alchemist guild, the alchemists who previously were unfamiliar with him all respectfully bowed.Long Chen\u2019s display of alchemy yesterday had already become common knowledge within the capital. Despite his opponent essentially cheating, he still managed to win a complete victory, awing them.He was but sixteen years old when he acquired the rank of a Pill Apprentice, and now he was essentially a Pill Adept. His future would be limitless. Even if they couldn\u2019t curry favor with him, they still couldn\u2019t leave him a bad impression.Long Chen was still a bit unused to his sudden rise. Making some inquiries, he learned that Yun Qi was currently in his own room, and he went straight there.\u201cEnter.\u201dJust as he was about to knock, Yun Qi\u2019s old voice rang out.Entering, he saw Yun Qi sitting lotus-style. In front of him was a bowl of water, but the water was as black as ink and even emitted a fishy odor.\u201cWei Cang\u2019s Yin Fiend Palm has become much more powerful. But it is a heretical technique and is unable to become a great technique.\u201d Yun Qi disdainfully looked at the bowl of black water.\u201cGrandmaster, is your hand okay?\u201dYun Qi had received Wei Cang\u2019s palm that day, and that palm had contained a Yin Fiend\u2019s poison.\u201cAfter a night\u2019s work, it\u2019s basically fine now,\u201d smiled Yun Qi.\u201cIt took a whole night?\u201d Long Chen was startled. Grandmaster Yun Qi had profound skill and power. Even with his powerful Pill Flame, he had needed a whole night to purify it?\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be surprised. Wei Cang\u2019s Yin Fiend Palm is extremely sinister and has a resistance to Pill Flame. Although it took a night to purify the poison, Wei Cang will require a whole month to once more accumulate that level of toxicity again, and that is why I said it was a heretic technique that couldn\u2019t become a great technique,\u201d explained grandmaster Yun Qi.Only now did Long Chen realize that Wei Cang probably had a limited accomplishment with his Pill Flame compared to other Pill Masters, so he had cultivated a sinister poison Battle Skill like the Yin Fiend Palm, using it to restrain other Pill Masters.For a Pill Master like him to not focus on his own body\u2019s flame and instead go cultivate a poisonous palm, it was no wonder grandmaster Yun Qi turned his nose up at him.\u201cYour wounds have healed?\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi was slightly surprised.\u201cHehe, this kid\u2019s skin is tough and the meat is thick. Just one night\u2019s rest and I\u2019m fine,\u201d laughed Long Chen.Grandmaster Yun Qi looked him up and down and sighed, \u201cOriginally, I had hoped that you could focus wholeheartedly on pills. With your spiritual talent, you will be able to walk ever further than me on the pill path. But after yesterday\u2019s battle, I\u2019ve changed my thinking. A martial genius who can battle those in higher realms than him is too rare. It really is a mess.\u201d\u201cHehe, don\u2019t worry, grandmaster. I won\u2019t give up either path.\u201d Long Chen truly was speaking the truth.That was because his Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was complemented by his accomplishments in alchemy. Without his alchemy, he wouldn\u2019t have even been able to condense his FengFu Star, let alone cultivate.As for the second star, third star, and so on, they all required medicinal pills to condense. Even just the simplest FengFu Star had used up countless medicinal pills.According to his memories, each following star\u2019s condensation would require an even greater amount of resources than the last. It was a number that was simply impossible to calculate.Although he didn\u2019t know the exact number, he knew that to condense his FengFu Star, he had consumed hundreds of medicinal pills.But although the cost was high, the benefits were also correspondingly high. Otherwise, a trash like him who didn\u2019t even have a Spirit Root couldn\u2019t even dream of standing out, let alone battle across realms.\u201cDual pill martial cultivation isn\u2019t completely unheard of, but usually, the gains are not worth the losses. Splitting your attention into two paths requires twice the effort for half the gains. Historically, dual pill martial cultivators all wasted their time and in the end, accomplished nothing, filling them with regret in their final days.\u201d Yun Qi shook his head.Grandmaster Yun Qi wasn\u2019t wrong. No matter how talented you were, without one hundred percent of your effort focused, you would just end up living a mediocre life.As for dual pill martial cultivation, it split your time and energy. Countless people had left bitter lessons to later generations, saying that it was a failed path they couldn\u2019t return from.But Long Chen had displayed great talent whether it was in terms of the pill path or the martial path. His talent was absolutely shocking, and even Pill Master Yun Qi didn\u2019t feel that Long Chen should give up on the martial path.If you chose pill cultivation, all your spiritual qi would be transformed to flame, and you would only be able to use one attribute of Battle Skills.Although they had great power, if they met someone with the subduing water-attribute Battle Skills, they basically could only run.But Pill Masters were extremely respected, so why would they go battle with others? Others would all want to get a favor from them, so how many would offend them?Although Pill Masters didn\u2019t necessarily have a frightening battle power, you couldn\u2019t forget that each Pill Master had an extremely large support. All sects needed to form good relations with pill cultivators so they could obtain the medicinal pills they needed.If a pill cultivator went out, even if he was only a Pill Apprentice, there would be countless powers fighting over that person.That was why grandmaster Yun Qi had said \u2018it was a mess\u2019. But Long Chen wasn\u2019t at a loss at all; he had already planned to advance forward on both.\u201cI come over today to thank grandmaster for his assistance yesterday.\u201d Long Chen was actually very grateful for his assistance and support.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s just a small matter. You also let me relieve quite a bit of anger yesterday, so I should be the one thanking you.\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi laughed and gave Long Chen a praying mat. Letting him sit on it, he said, \u201cDo you want to know why Wei Cang and I are like fire and water to each other?\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 Pill ValleyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cDo you want to know why Wei Cang and I are like fire and water?\u201dLong Chen was startled; he actually had wanted to know this; however, such a thing was too embarrassing to ask about. But now that Yun Qi had brought it up, it naturally evoked his curiosity.Yun Qi began to tell him a story. From it, Long Chen learned that Yun Qi and Wei Cang had actually been fellow apprentices. Their master had taken three apprentices in his lifetime.Other than Yun Qi and Wei Cang, there was a third, female apprentice. That person had been Yun Qi\u2019s wife, the woman in the drawing he had shown Long Chen who looked just like Xia Baichi.Their master was a reclused expert, and only in his final years did he take three apprentices and pass down his refining techniques.Those three had been extremely talented in refining pills, especially Yun Qi. He had been the best amongst the three, and their master did everything to teach him.But jealousy was a constant part of human nature, especially for Wei Cang who had been born in a humble background. He had felt extremely bitter and cynical about his master\u2019s preferential treatment of Yun Qi.He had always suppressed those feelings and never displayed them until there finally came a day when their master had reached an extremely great age and his life was about to end. He had called Yun Qi to his side and given him a tablet.\u201cHaha, my enmity with Wei Cang all stemmed from this tablet.\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi sighed, and a bronze tablet appeared in his hand. The entire room became warmer when that tablet appeared.Carved on the tablet was a delicate pill cauldron with thousands of rays of light coming from it, appearing extremely lifelike.The other side had a scenic picture on it. There were mountains and water, and between them was a valley. Immortal qi hazily curled around its surroundings, and just looking at it caused Long Chen\u2019s mind to become much brighter.\u201cThis is what my master left me. Because of it, us fellow apprentices ended up quarreling, and my loving wife was implicated and died.\u201dYun Qi rubbed the tablet with a complicated expression. There was both a trace of regret and a trace of mourning.Long Chen didn\u2019t know what to say. Eventually, Yun Qi put aside those feeling and continued.Originally, their master had given it to Yun Qi secretly, and only the two of them had known of it. But somehow Wei Cang had learned of its existence and began to demand it from Yun Qi.Yun Qi refused no matter how Wei Cang wheedled him. Seeing that his attempts produced no result and since he wasn\u2019t a match for Yun Qi, Wei Cang finally turned a sinister hand towards their junior apprentice-sister.Their junior apprentice-sister had already expressed her affection for Yun Qi in secret, and Wei Cang had hatched a plot around her, using her life to extort Yun Qi.But no one had expected that their usually gentle junior apprentice-sister was actually extremely resolute and upright inside. She had killed herself rather than to bring Yun Qi down.This panicked Wei Cang; Yun Qi\u2019s killing intent had exploded, shaking the heavens. He had wanted to tear Wei Cang into a thousand pieces as revenge for his junior apprentice-sister.But although Wei Cang was much weaker than Yun Qi when it came to refining pills, in terms of combat ability, he was only slightly weaker.Knowing he couldn\u2019t beat Yun Qi, Wei Cang had fled. Yun Qi had chased him for thousands of miles but Wei Cang still escaped in the end. Over the next thirty years, Yun Qi had never stopped inquiring news about Wei Cang, always wanting to get revenge for his junior apprentice-sister.But Wei Cang was extremely crafty and never revealed himself. He even occasionally requested experts to go kill Yun Qi, and over that time, Yun Qi was attacked several times and almost died.Finally, Yun Qi awoke from his hatred. If it continued on like this, then he would not only be unable to get his revenge, he would even lose his life.By using his powerful pill refining arts, he had entered the alchemist guild and become a guild chairman, temporarily laying down his vengeance.But just a couple of years ago, Wei Cang had appeared again, and he had also become an alchemist guild\u2019s chairman.Although over thirty years had passed, that hatred hadn\u2019t lessened in the slightest and the two of them had fought many times.Wei Cang had honed the Yin Fiend Poison Palm over those years. In their battles, Yun Qi always came out slightly ahead, but he was never able to end him, so Wei Cang always managed to flee.Now, the number of their battles had lessened in the past two years. That was because both of them had found out all the other person\u2019s trump cards, and so there was no need to waste energy. Unless they could find a way to finish the other off in one blow, neither wished to go do battle again.\u201cAre you curious about what this tablet is, for us fellow disciples to fight over it like this?\u201d After narrating until here, grandmaster Yun Qi suddenly asked a question.Long Chen nodded; he truly was curious. Just what was the background of this tablet for Wei Cang to become so crazy?A mocking sneer appeared on grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s face. \u201cWei Cang actually doesn\u2019t even know what it is. He originally thought that master had become biased and gave me a secret art. But in reality, it is just a normal tablet.\u201d\u201cA normal tablet?\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help being shocked. For just a tablet, he ended up causing the death of a fellow apprentice?\u201cYes, it\u2019s just a normal tablet. It has no use, but at the time, master commanded me to take care of it, so I couldn\u2019t refuse. Originally, I was actually starting to become unable to ignore Wei Cang\u2019s wheedling and was preparing to give it to him to take care of, but then he actually stretched his sinister hand at junior apprentice-sister\u2026\u201d Anger and killing intent soared from him.At the same time, Long Chen saw remorse and self-blame on his face. For a useless piece of trash, he had implicated his lover. If that happened to Long Chen, then he might go crazy.\u201cThis tablet is actually a proof of study.\u201d Yun Qi took a deep breath and calmed himself.\u201cProof of study?\u201d Long Chen was confused.\u201cYes, this is proof of study from the holy land of pill cultivation, Pill Valley. As for Pill Valley\u2026 Well, it\u2019s still a bit early to talk about it. You just have to know that it is viewed as the highest, holy existence in the world of pill cultivators. In an uncivilized place like this, no one knows of it. I\u2019ve carried this thing for dozens of years. Now, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d He handed the tablet to Long Chen.\u201cGrandmaster, this is completely unacceptable! This was given to you by your master, and this little one definitely can\u2019t accept it.\u201d Long Chen hastily waved his hand.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t left for me. Master wanted me to find someone to give it to. I\u2019m giving it to you, but even so, it might not have any use for you.\u201d Yun Qi smiled slightly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis tablet can be considered a way to step to fortune, but without power, you won\u2019t be able to take that step, let alone gain a fortune.\u201d Yun Qi bitterly smiled. \u201cI told you just now that the Pill Valley is a holy land in the eyes of pill cultivators. How could it be so easy to enter? Even with this tablet, you need a matching strength to use it, or it will continue to be useless.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of strength?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cIf you become a Pill King before twenty, then you can use this tablet to register there.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi sighed.Long Chen\u2019s mouth dropped. Pill King? Before twenty? Was he kidding?A person like grandmaster Yun Qi had trained for almost a hundred years and had only reached the peak of Pill Master. Wasn\u2019t a twenty-year-old Pill King just a crazy joke?No wonder grandmaster Yun Qi had had such a strange expression. For such a thing, he had his wife\u2019s life implicated. Anyone would go crazy.Long Chen suddenly realized that Yun Qi had kept this a secret for so long, all in order to get revenge on Wei Cang.He had kept this \u2018treasure\u2019 to constantly draw Wei Cang\u2019s attention. Wei Cang longed for it deeply since he didn\u2019t know the truth.Xia Baichi had also appeared most likely just to obtain it. When Long Chen had then popped up later, Yun Qi\u2019s treatment of him had caused them to panic.That was why they wanted Long Chen to die. They wanted Yun Qi to have no more successors. If he, Wei Cang, was unable to obtain it, then let it die in Yun Qi\u2019s hands.Long Chen didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry; what had it all been for? The heavens truly did play jokes on man.\u201cAlthough you are extremely talented, you were unfortunately born in an uncivilized place like this. There are no powerful schools\u2019 inheritances for you here, and so the chance of you being able to use this tablet is low. But even a slight chance is something. When my master gave me this, he told me to find someone to pass it on to. One of his ancestors had managed to enter Pill Valley, and this tablet was a sign of their honor. That is why I hoped there would one day come a genius who could take this tablet and once more join Pill Valley. I\u2019ve invested so much time for master\u2019s inheritance. Now, I will pass it on to you. It is also a load off my shoulders.\u201d Yun Qi had an extremely complicated expression.This tablet had changed the course of his entire life. But that change had been a complete tragedy.Who was he supposed to hate? His master? Wei Cang? Himself? Or perhaps the heavens themselves?Fate seemed to have been bored and decided to play a huge joke on him. However, he was unable to laugh at such a joke.Long Chen reached out to take the tablet. Becoming a Pill King before twenty\u2026 others might not have any hope of that, but Long Chen was not like others.\u201cMany thanks, grandmaster,\u201d Long Chen said respectfully.\u201cIf one of us should be thanking the other, then it should be me. By handing this tablet to you, I have completed my master\u2019s task and I can finally be free to do a couple of things.\u201d Yun Qi smiled slightly.Long Chen was alarmed. \u201cGrandmaster\u2026 you\u2026\u201dAs if seeing through what Long Chen was thinking, Yun Qi laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not thinking anything bad. I won\u2019t go sacrificing myself to bring down Wei Cang. Wouldn\u2019t that mean that I lost?\u201dThat relieved Long Chen. If after receiving the tablet from him, Yun Qi decided to go fight Wei Cang in a battle of mutual destruction, he definitely would feel horrible about it.If a great person like Yun Qi ended up dying along with that old pervert, it would be an absolute shame, like using a porcelain vase to smash a rat.\u201cChild, I can\u2019t teach you much at all. But you are the person I have the greatest hope for. You must work hard.\u201d Although Yun Qi didn\u2019t want to go on and on, he couldn\u2019t help nagging him a bit more.If Long Chen could enter the Pill Valley, in terms of pill cultivation, it would be like ascending to become an immortal.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, grandmaster. This disciple will continue working his hardest.\u201dAlthough grandmaster Yun Qi hadn\u2019t taken Long Chen in as his apprentice, that was only because he didn\u2019t want to draw any attention to Long Chen. After all, Wei Cang was watching him like a tiger watches his prey.However, Long Chen\u2019s current state of affairs with Wei Cang was something everyone knew about. He had beaten his apprentice and expressed his thoughts about the man.Before letting him leave, grandmaster Yun Qi warned Long Chen once more to be cautious. If the enemy was pressed too hard, then they might make a desperate move. Long Chen nodded his assent.He went directly home. Now, he had become much more powerful so he was confident in being able to walk through the city without being killed.But when he turned around the corner and saw the gate to his home, his eyes opened widely.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 Busy as a MarketplacePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeTurning the corner, Long Chen stopped, stunned at what he was seeing.The entrance to his noble estate, which used to be always deserted, now had a long queue in front of it; all of them were married women in their forties or fifties.He looked around and had to confirm again that this was his house. Only then did he walk over.At this time, Bao-er was laughing happily as she received them. \u201cDon\u2019t worry everyone, take it slow. Register the name, status, measurements, a picture, and any other particulars clearly for me.\u201d\u201cMiss, can you tell us what the Madam likes in a daughter-in-law?\u201d one of the wives smiled charmingly.\u201cHehe, as long as they conduct themselves properly and aren\u2019t ugly, then anything is fine. But the Madam did say she liked those with big hips the best. She said that the wider the hips, the easier she\u2019ll give birth. Let me tell you, my Madam has actually long since desired to hold a grandson\u2026 Haha, young master, you\u2019ve returned.\u201d Bao-er was enthusiastically talking to them when she suddenly saw the gloomy Long Chen.\u201cGreetings young master.\u201d Those wives all quickly greeted him.Long Chen nodded to them and then pulled Bao-er into the courtyard. Pointing to the wives, he angrily whispered, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYoung master, yesterday you boldly defeated an opponent from the Grand Xia and basically obtained the title of number one junior warrior in the Phoenix Cry capital. You\u2019ve become an idol for countless maidens, and they\u2019re all here to make familial ties.\u201d Bao-er covered up her smile.\u201cI knew you would make trouble. Where\u2019s mom?\u201d\u201cMadam is inside. Aiya, I actually forgot, she told me she wanted to see you as soon as you came home.\u201d Bao-er clapped her forehead.\u201cGood, I\u2019ll go right now. You, hurry up and find a way to get rid of them. What kind of place is this? This isn\u2019t a marketplace.\u201d Long Chen wasn\u2019t in a good mood.\u201cHehe, I can\u2019t do that. Madam sent me to receive all of them. I better go.\u201dWho would have thought that the always cute and obedient Bao-er would actually not listen to Long Chen and run back to those wives with delight?Long Chen rolled his eyes and went to see his mother. His mind was constantly spinning along the way, trying to find a way to describe the events that had occurred yesterday without making his mother worried.But as soon as he entered her room, before he could even say anything, his mother angrily said, \u201cThis annoying kid, hurry up and enter.\u201dAh, perhaps there was no way for him to explain himself. No matter how he thought about it, he couldn\u2019t come up with a good excuse.But what he had not expected was for his mother to pull him over to a table covered in pictures of beautiful women.\u201cChen-er, look, these nineteen ladies were carefully selected by me out of over a hundred. Whether it is in terms of beauty, etiquette, or status, they are all very suitable for you. Quickly look, do any attract your interest?\u201dSeeing that Long Chen was in a daze, Mrs. Long urged, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Hurry up and check them out.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll look.\u201dOnly now did Long Chen realize that his mother had already completely forgotten the danger he had been in yesterday.But when he looked at those portraits, Long Chen\u2019s expression became a bit strange.Mrs. Long said complacently, \u201cLook at how beautiful they are Chen-er. Especially their waists and hips; they definitely are suited for birthing. If you marry a couple of them, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll definitely be some babies growing in just a few months.\u201dMrs. Long was unable to contain her own joy. It seemed as if she could already see the scene of herself holding a bunch of her grandchildren.A bead of sweat rolled down Long Chen\u2019s face, dripping onto the portraits. It ended up landing on a girls\u2019 buttocks, following along the ink and making that part seem even larger\u2026\u201cMom, I feel like this should\u201d Long Chen started to make an excuse.\u201cStop delaying. Before, your mom thought you wouldn\u2019t be able to find a suitable wife, and now that so many candidates have come today, don\u2019t you dare waste this chance. I won\u2019t make it hard for you. Pick out three for me today and later on, you can pick some more. In any case, if you don\u2019t choose at least ten of them, don\u2019t even think of going away.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s face turned green. Was this supposed to be like breeding livestock? But looking at how strict she was, it seemed she was extremely serious about this matter.Just as he was at a loss on how to reply, a rough voice rang out. \u201cBrother Long.\u201dA huge figure rushed in and embraced Long Chen. \u201cBrother Long, I heard you fought with someone yesterday. Why didn\u2019t you bring me?\u201dLong Chen saw that it was Wilde who had rushed in. Inside, he cheered; this brother of his had truly come at the perfect time.\u201cMom, I still have some stuff to do and have to talk to Wilde. You just slowly do some selections. Once you finish those, I\u2019ll come to look again.\u201d\u201cKid, you\u201dJust as she was beginning to speak, Long Chen had already quickly pulled Wilde far away.\u201cThat rascal.\u201dShe quietly scolded, but when she turned back to look at the portraits of those ample girls, she quickly became gratified.\u201cBrother Long, did you get injured yesterday?\u201d Wilde asked Long Chen in concern.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Your brother Long will now have to fight more and more. Speaking of which, have you learned how to use that technique of using spiritual qi that I taught you?\u201d asked Long Chen.He had taught Wilde how to circulate his spiritual qi throughout his meridians. But his comprehension skills were extremely low.If it weren\u2019t for how powerful Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength was and that he could teach him by actually guiding him from within, it would have been impossible for anyone to teach him.When Long Chen brought up cultivation, Wilde became extremely proud. \u201cBrother Long, I can already use that technique you taught me.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Long Chen was delighted.Long Chen brought Wilde to an empty area behind the estate. Pointing towards a stone the rough size of a human, he said, \u201cCrush this just with the wind generated from your fist.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wilde agreed and punched out a single fist.Wind rushed over the stone, causing it to tremble slightly.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it right this time. Again.\u201d Wilde was a bit embarrassed.Another fist shot out, and the wind still only caused the stone to tremble slightly.\u201cStrange. Again!\u201dHe tried three more times, but the stone remained the same as ever. Long Chen\u2019s face darkened.\u201cWilde, this is what you\u2019ve learned?\u201d\u201cYes. Normally, I can succeed in three out of ten punches. It\u2019s just not working today\u2026\u201d Wilde was distressed.Hearing that, Long Chen almost stumbled. When fighting with others, could you really rely on chance?Long Chen felt a headache. Wilde was basically a treasure trove, but the difficulty in unlocking that treasure trove was incredibly great.Placing a hand on Wilde\u2019s back, Long Chen said, \u201cTry again.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWilde once more punched out, but this time, there was not the least bit of energy behind it.\u201cBefore you punch, you have to prepare! First, urge your Dantian into motion, and then punch out. Remember that it is the Dantian that drives the fist, and not the fist that urges the Dantian.\u201dWhile he was in contact with Wilde\u2019s body, he could sense that Wilde was first punching out and then using his meridians in an attempt to spur the Dantian.That kind of technique could work, but when it came to Wilde, it would be a matter of luck. Experienced cultivators would have no problem doing it like that, but it would be too difficult for Wilde to do that.\u201cTry again. Don\u2019t rush your punch. Circulate your Dantian. Okay, your Dantian is operating. Punch.\u201dBOOM!A huge boom rang out and that man-sized stone was crushed into complete rubble.\u201cBrother Long, I succeeded!\u201d happily shouted Wilde.Long Chen nodded. He appeared calm on the outside, but inside, he was filled with endless shock. Wilde had once more become much stronger.That last punch had had enough power to crush the late stage Blood Condensation Huang Chang.Although he wouldn\u2019t be able to compare to Huang Chang once he used his beast transformation, Wilde was probably even better than him in terms of power. However, his movements had far too many flaws.But at this point, he had only managed to use a strand of energy from his Dantian and wasn\u2019t able to use his full power. That meant Wilde\u2019s potential was truly frightening.\u201cGood, now do it again,\u201d encouraged Long Chen.Wilde once more punched out, but this fist was empty like his previous ones.For a moment, it was just Long Chen looking at Wilde, and Wilde looking at Long Chen. Long Chen was completely silent for over ten minutes.Finally, Wilde patted his head. \u201cBrother Long, is it that I\u2019m too dumb?\u201d\u201cI really want to tell you that you\u2019re not dumb, but since I hear liars will be struck by lightning, I don\u2019t dare say it.\u201d Long Chen looked at the sky worriedly.\u201cThen, what should I do?\u201d Wilde was completely dejected.\u201cFrom tomorrow onwards, you won\u2019t stay at the estate. Go back to the pasture.\u201d\u201cBrother Long\u2026 do you not want me anymore?\u201d Wilde was completely startled and filled with fright.Long Chen laughed involuntarily, patting Wilde\u2019s thick shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t joke around. We\u2019re life and death brothers.\u201d\u201cThen, why do you want me to go to the pasture?\u201d\u201cFrom tomorrow onwards, all your food will have to be handled by yourself. If you want beef, then you have to kill the cow yourself. However, the condition is that you must use your attack containing spiritual qi to kill the cow. Otherwise, you\u2019ll just have to live with an empty stomach. Go.\u201dWilde promised him and walked away. Watching Wilde\u2019s back as he left, Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit helpless.Wilde\u2019s comprehension skill was too worrying. Sometimes, he worried about whether he should keep Wilde by his side. With his intelligence, he really was a bit too dangerous.He was an honest person, honest to the point where his head couldn\u2019t even comprehend tricks. That was also why he would never goof off on what Long Chen told him to do.Long Chen\u2019s instructions were to make him accustomed to using spiritual qi. Otherwise, when he fought with others, each of his attacks would only have a chance of working. That was no different than sending him to death.In any case, Wilde\u2019s appetite was growing every day, and each day, he ate over a hundred cows. That was enough for him to train.If he unlocked his full power and became accustomed to using his spiritual qi, Wilde\u2019s strength would reach a level that would terrify even Long Chen himself.After properly arranging Wilde\u2019s matters, Long Chen returned to his own room. On the way, he saw that line of wives and the happily busy Bao-er. Sweat once more began to roll off his forehead.He sent instructions that he was entering seclusion and not to bother him unless something huge happened.He was at the eighth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation. One more advancement would let him reach the ninth Heavenstage, and from there, he could directly step into Blood Condensation.Only once he reached the Blood Condensation realm could he truly be able to guarantee his survival. He was extremely irritated that nothing was under his control.\u201cJust wait. Time for me to see the true faces of the people who have constantly been scheming against me.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 Tenth Level of Qi CondensationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeEver since the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival, knowledge of Long Chen and Huang Chang\u2019s peak battle had spread in every direction. Long Chen\u2019s fame had spread not only throughout the capital but even throughout the entire empire. There was practically not a single person that didn\u2019t know his name.This was especially true of the younger generation. Long Chen was their idol. Whenever his name was brought up, they would be worshipful and envious.Of course, in any world, there was no lack of geniuses. And of course, geniuses didn\u2019t all have to be on the martial path.You could also gain fame in other specialties. Now, just over ten days had passed since Long Chen\u2019s battle. However, in just these few short days, there had been a genius who had used Long Chen to make a crazy profit of millions of gold coins.That person was originally just a master painter. Although such a person wouldn\u2019t be in a state of poverty within the capital, such a profession could not be considered high level. The income was rather meager.But after that person had seen Long Chen\u2019s battle, he had immediately returned home and spent three days and three nights without pause to draw over ten refined drawings.The person in those drawings was precisely Long Chen. Originally, Long Chen was handsome enough and had an easy-going confidence. Following that master painter\u2019s backgrounds and lighting exaggerations, he had been transformed to practically look like a divinity.The scenes of his pill battle and subsequent fight had been especially exaggerated by him to appear extremely vivid and exciting.After he drew those, he went directly to the largest printing workshop. After that, an extremely impressive drawing of Long Chen became available in the capital, and those young men and women went crazy for it.Thousands of drawings were immediately sold out. Some people who hadn\u2019t managed to snatch one had already begun to stalk the printing workshop. The entire staff of hundreds of people worked incessantly, but that crowd of people waiting only grew larger.The printer workshop actually had to hire more people as time went on, and only after a week had passed did they just manage to satisfy most of the demand.But if that had been all, then that master painter would have only counted as an average businessman. He had a brilliant plan, and after that first painting had been sold off, he added another.This new drawing was even more refined than the first. What it pictured was even more impressive, and it was printed on an extremely expensive animal hide paper. That meant it could survive for hundreds of years without fading. It had been advertised popularly as being a limited edition collector\u2019s item.Of course, this limited edition collector\u2019s drawing was sold at a considerable price. But countless youngsters came to buy it, and the sales were positively shocking.But what no one expected was that after this limited collector\u2019s painting had sold enough, a graphic novel called the Phoenix Cry Divine Battle silently appeared on the marketplace.That comic was a record of that day\u2019s scenes which contained the third princess\u2019s confession, Xia Baichi\u2019s pill battle, Huang Chang infuriating Long Chen, and Long Chen\u2019s bloody battle with Huang Chang. That entire story had been expressed through pictures perfectly.From the pictures to the graphic novel, that painter and the workshop basically emptied the pockets of all the youngsters in the capital.Over just a few weeks, they had profited at least millions of gold coins. That originally poor painter immediately became a celebrity within the capital. Other than Long Chen, he was probably the most famous person in the capital now.Long Chen was not aware of this matter along with countless other things that had occurred in the capital. After a couple of weeks, Long Chen had already broken through to the ninth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation a few days ago.It went without saying that this fast speed was absolutely related to that life and death battle he had had with Huang Chang.Only by experiencing life and death trials and only by facing the pressure that came with them could you make your Dao-heart steadier and firmer. And only then would your cultivation speed increase without causing your cultivation base to become unsteady.Currently, Long Chen was pushing his nine cyclones to the max in order to absorb the world\u2019s spiritual qi into his FengFu Star. As long as his FengFu Star became maxed out on energy, he would be able to draw out Blood Qi and enter the Blood Condensation realm.The so-called Blood Condensation realm was named so due to the intention of condensing the blood and qi. Blood was one of the most important parts of the body. Only by reaching the Blood Condensation realm could you count as a true martial artist.You condensed blood by circulating real qi to purify your blood. All the various foods that people often ate caused impurities to form within the body. Therefore, the blood needed to be refined and condensed in order to expel those impurities, letting your strength become greater.But before entering the Blood Condensation realm, you had to reach the peak of the ninth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation. Only by compressing the spiritual qi in your body to a certain level could your qi transform the blood. This gave birth to something known commonly as Blood Qi.Once blood and qi combined, the energy that was released was inconceivable. At the same time, it was the most important foundational level for cultivators.BOOM!Currently, Long Chen\u2019s FengFu Star was starting to surge, a sign that he was about to enter the Blood Condensation realm. Long Chen couldn\u2019t help rejoicing, but he hastily stabilized his emotions and slowly circulated his cyclones, steadily absorbing energy.This was an extremely critical moment. There could be no mistakes. The slightest error would cause a backlash that would injure him, and it was very likely that some of those nine cyclones he had managed to form would break apart, causing his realm to fall.BOOM BOOM BOOM!His FengFu Star repeatedly boomed. His spiritual qi was continuously being compressed. Having reached this critical moment, Long Chen didn\u2019t dare to be the slightest bit careless. All his attention was completely focused.But what Long Chen had not expected was that these explosive sounds continued for six whole hours, yet nothing changed within his body.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dHe was completely astonished by this. This situation was completely different from what was recorded in the literature.It was definitely not supposed to be this difficult. Within the Battle Skill Pavilion, he had paged through several records regarding cultivation. When most people tried attacking the Blood Condensation realm, there was usually a single pair of \u2018shackles\u2019 that prevented them. But as long as they had enough spiritual qi, they would be able to break those shackles and advance to Blood Condensation.There were also some people with two or even three shackles that they had to break out of before entering the Blood Condensation realm. It was said that the more shackles that had to be broken when advancing, the greater potential that person would have.Long Chen had broken through nine shackles right at the beginning and went mad with joy, thinking he must be an absolutely peerless talent. But as he broke more and more shackles, Long Chen\u2019s delight turned into shock.He didn\u2019t even know how many shackles he had broken through after these six hours. He didn\u2019t count precisely, but it was definitely a number in the hundreds.This completely toppled common sense. In those recordings he had read, the maximum number had only been three.It had already been six hours. It would be a lie to say that he wasn\u2019t afraid now. Those shackles kept coming endlessly.\u201cI don\u2019t believe I won\u2019t overcome you!\u201dLong Chen ground his teeth. Since it had already reached this point, giving up halfway would only hurt his confidence in himself. In addition, the next time he tried breaking through would at least be twice as difficult.He could only force himself to continue. After a full day and night had passed, Long Chen had practically gone insane.Who knew how many shackles he had broken through. He was already numb now. Even with his perseverance, he started to feel like giving up.He had even started to form some doubts about the FengFu Star. Was it possible that the FengFu Star couldn\u2019t be treated like a true substitute for a Dantian?BOOM!While Long Chen\u2019s mind was going crazy, his FengFu Star suddenly blossomed with light. Could it be that he had finally succeeded?Following that explosion, his Dantian surged. Long Chen watched dumbstruck as another cyclone slowly appeared beside the other nine. He had actually formed a tenth cyclone!\u201cWhat kind of joke is this?\u201dLong Chen couldn\u2019t believe this. Couldn\u2019t there only be nine cyclones in total, representing the nine Heavenstages of Qi Condensation? What was going on now?After this full day\u2019s torment without breaking through to Blood Condensation, he had actually ended up forming a tenth cyclone.There were nine Heavenstages to Qi Condensation. This was something that had been true since forever. Even amongst the countless freaks of the cultivation world, there had never been anyone who had heard of condensing ten cyclones.Anyone who had this happen to them would be flabbergasted. Long Chen was no exception. He looked foolishly upon those ten cyclones in his body and was unable to say anything.Long Chen suddenly noticed that after the tenth cyclone appeared, his other cyclones all started to gradually grow larger. Although it was extremely slow, they were definitely expanding.Whatever size the cyclone formed at the beginning was supposed to be its set size forever. That was also just common knowledge.\u201cCould it be because of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art?\u201dLong Chen could only attribute these anomalies to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Now that he had cultivated in that technique, his entire cultivation path had deviated from the norm.He watched them as they slowly doubled in size over the course of less than an hour. They were now around a foot wide.Although he didn\u2019t know what was causing this, Long Chen knew that the larger the size of his cyclones was, the more beneficial it would be to him.The larger they were, the faster he could absorb heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi. He wouldn\u2019t have to use up so much energy during a battle, and his recovery speed would be much greater.But he was still scared by what had happened just now. Originally, something celebratory should have happened today, but instead, he was alarmed. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was just too strange.At just the seventh Heavenstage of Qi Condensation, he could jump a whole major realm plus its minor realms to fight Huang Chang who was at the seventh Heavenstage of Blood Condensation. That was already an extremely frightening battle strength.It seemed as if the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was like an endless treasure house. What he had found out about it so far was just the tip of the iceberg. And yet, just that tip contained delights and horrors. Even Long Chen himself had both high expectations and fear for his future. It was a very contradictory sensation.The fact that he had ten cyclones definitely could not be revealed for the fear of his life. Such a defiant technique was something everyone would become jealous of. When he fought in the future, he definitely couldn\u2019t use such explosive techniques like last time and reveal the ten cyclones.But what Long Chen was most unsure of was just how many cyclones could be formed in the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art\u2019s Qi Condensation realm.On one hand, it was possible to say that the more cyclones he had, the better. But if he didn\u2019t advance to the next realm, then his combat abilities wouldn\u2019t truly progress. Even if you had ten thousand cows, they wouldn\u2019t be able to beat a single tiger.The most alarming thing was how much danger he was in. He couldn\u2019t even tell who his enemies were at this time. It was unknown just when they would pop out and try to take his life. He had to quickly raise his cultivation base.Looking at the cyclones within his body that were still slowly growing, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Perhaps, this was what it meant to have mixed feelings.Long Chen no longer wanted to continue cultivating today. In any case, the current mood he was in was no longer suitable for cultivating. He had to adjust himself.Suddenly, his stomach let out a loud rumble. Only now did he realize he hadn\u2019t eaten anything today.Opening his door, he took in a breath of fresh air. Noticing it was noon, he shouted for Bao-er to prepare lunch for him.He was a bit afraid to see his mom at this time, so he went about it sneakily. Bao-er appeared to have figured that out and laughed, bringing him lunch.He ate a plate of white cut chicken, a plate of fish, two vegetable dishes, and a bowl of soup. It was both simple and rich.After finishing, he felt his mood improve by quite a bit. His irritation with the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art also had decreased greatly.\u201cYoung master, someone\u2019s looking for you.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cI don\u2019t know. You should go take a look. You looked like you were eating happily so I didn\u2019t disturb you,\u201d laughed Bao-er.Long Chen also laughed. Now that the Long family was richer and happier, Bao-er had started to become a bit naughty. She even dared to give guests the cold shoulder.Arriving at the guest room, Long Chen was absolutely shocked to see that this person had come to find him.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had never had any further interactions after that disagreeable moment in the Imperial College.But since the seventh prince was Chu Yao\u2019s true flesh and blood younger brother, Long Chen also felt a bit apologetic about what had happened last time. In the future, he would be his brother-in-law.\u201cBrother Long, you should call me Chu Feng,\u201d said the seventh prince hastily and respectfully. He acted completely different from his old bossy and domineering self.Long Chen had learned from Chu Yao that Chu Feng wasn\u2019t actually a bad person and only did his best to act like an arrogant fool in order to protect himself. It was all to keep himself alive.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about last time.\u201d Long Chen nodded and patted Chu Feng on the shoulders.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t brother Long\u2019s fault.\u201d Chu Feng was very modest and unpretentious.Pouring two cups of tea, Long Chen handed one cup to Chu Feng and asked, \u201cWhat are you here for?\u201dThis time, Chu Feng wasn\u2019t wearing his imperial clothing, but just some embroidered robes similar to what a noble son would wear.\u201cBrother Long\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Chu Feng opened his mouth a couple of times but couldn\u2019t say what he wanted.\u201cJust say it.\u201dChu Feng hesitated and took a deep breath. \u201cThe Empress Dowager announced today that she is marrying my big sister to Xia Changfeng. They set the date for the first of October.\u201dAlthough Long Chen was already prepared to hear this news, his blood surged and the teacup in his hand shattered, the tea splattering over him.Not only was killing intent rumbling within his eyes, but the entire room immediately turned icy cold. Chu Feng couldn\u2019t help but to shiver.The current Long Chen looked just like an infuriated savage beast. It was as if he might explode and kill someone at any moment. His killing intent was a hundred times stronger than it had been back then in the Imperial College.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Long Chen ground his teeth.Chu Feng nodded. It was difficult for him to even speak under Long Chen\u2019s pressure.Long Chen was incomparably enraged. He had already promised Chu Yao in front of everyone that she was his woman.He hadn\u2019t used his relationship with grandmaster Yun Qi to force the proposal with Chu Yao, which could be counted as giving enough face to the Empress Dowager. He had given her an easy way out of a difficult situation since he hadn\u2019t wanted to make it too embarrassing for her.But she actually completely disregarded his good intentions. She also completely ignored grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s face and married off Chu Yao to Xia Changfeng without hesitation.\u201cBrother Long, my big sister has lived a life of hardship and loneliness. She has always conducted herself properly, but I know about her secret situation. If she is married to Xia Changfeng, she will definitely die. So, brother Long, I\u2019m begging you to save my big sister.\u201d Chu Feng actually started to tear up, and after he said this, he slowly knelt down in front of Long Chen.\u201cHey, get up already.\u201d Long Chen pulled Chu Feng up. \u201cSince I already made a promise, then even in death, I will keep it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dChu Feng was extremely moved to hear that. Having lived his whole life in the imperial palace, trust was the only thing he had never had.\u201cChu Yao hasn\u2019t left the palace in a while. Is she under house arrest?\u201d asked Long Chen.Chu Feng nodded. \u201cYes. Ever since she returned last time, she\u2019s been confined within the palace. The Empress Dowager refuses to let her take a single step out.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s face was ashen. It seemed the Empress Dowager didn\u2019t give a crap about grandmaster Yun Qi. That old b*tch better wait for him.\u201cCan you go see her?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cI can. The Empress Dowager only forbid her to leave, but she can still see others. As her brother, they don\u2019t dare block me,\u201d answered Chu Feng.\u201cThen, that\u2019s good. There\u2019s still a month until October. There\u2019s enough time. The Huayun Pavilion\u2019s yearly auction will be three days from now. I\u2019ll do my best to get the Starfusing Grass to resolve the problem in her body. Tell her to wait for me. Don\u2019t let her do anything stupid.\u201dChu Feng was overjoyed. He thanked and apologized to Long Chen a thousand times, something Long Chen was completely unused to.\u201cChu Feng, let me see your Dantian.\u201dLong Chen was a bit suspicious and reached out his hand towards Chu Feng\u2019s shoulder. He slowly sent his spiritual qi into his Dantian.As expected, something strange was present!Although Chu Feng\u2019s Dantian hadn\u2019t been locked down like Chu Yao\u2019s, there was a strange entity on the Spiritual Root of his Dantian.It was something so small that it wasn\u2019t even visible by the naked eye. If Long Chen hadn\u2019t been suspicious, then he might have missed it.\u201cTry to hold on.\u201dLong Chen increased the spiritual qi he sent into Chu Feng\u2019s body. Chu Feng felt his stomach hurt for a moment and a small spurt of blood came from it. A small feathered needle appeared in Long Chen\u2019s hand.\u201cThe Underworld Feather Pin. How vicious.\u201dThis Underworld Feather Pin was actually used to treat a kind of Yang poison. Inside was a Yin poison that could relieve the Yang poison. Both poisons would neutralize each other to cure someone.But when it was placed into a healthy person\u2019s Dantian, the Dantian\u2019s Spirit Root would be corroded by its Yin poison, making it impossible to cultivate.Once more examining Chu Feng\u2019s Dantian, Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but sigh. After being corroded for so long by the Yin poison, Chu Feng\u2019s Spirit Root had already declined. Otherwise, his talent would not be that much inferior to Chu Yao\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019ve removed this poisonous needle from your body now. That means, you\u2019ll be able to cultivate from now on, but you must keep it secret. Here are a few aura concealing pills. Take one every seven days and no one will notice anything.\u201d Long Chen handed Chu Feng a jade bottle.When Long Chen had free time, he would refine some other random medicinal pills. Such pills had a great assistance to the current him.But Long Chen couldn\u2019t bear to tell Chu Feng that his Spirit Root had been severely corroded. The Blood Condensation realm would probably be his peak.At the same time as he felt this regret, he also became even more disgusted with the imperial household who were just tigers in human clothing.\u201cI can cultivate now?\u201d Chu Feng couldn\u2019t believe this. He had always thought that he was innately crippled. He was wildly overjoyed.Long Chen could understand this kind of mood. He had also been someone given the name of a cripple who had managed to gain an opportunity.\u201cYup. But remember to hide it from everyone,\u201d warned Long Chen. Although he knew that he and Chu Yao were already extremely careful, he still wanted to make sure there were no blunders.After sending off Chu Feng, Long Chen sunk into his own thoughts. Chu Yao and Chu Feng\u2019s situation had reminded him of his own predicament.However, he was in an even more tragic situation. His Spirit Root, Spirit Bone, and Spirit Blood had all been stolen away. Although the method wasn\u2019t the same, hadn\u2019t he also been plotted against as well?His own father was a peak expert of the Phoenix Cry Empire. Because of his father, he had ended up crippled.Last time, when he had chatted with Chu Yao she had told him a name - Marquis Ying.The three great experts of the Phoenix Cry Empire were Marquis Ying, Marquis Wu, and Long Chen\u2019s father the Border Suppression Marquis. They were called Phoenix Cry\u2019s three great pillars.[1]The Border Suppression Marquis guarded against the barbarian tribes of the wild border. Marquis Wu guarded the southern border. Only Marquis Ying always stayed within the capital.According to Chu Yao, all the princes and princesses were taught martial arts by Marquis Ying. Now, Long Chen felt that this Marquis Ying might actually be a very big problem.That was because Chu Yao\u2019s situation was something that an outsider like him had noticed the very first time they had exchanged blows. As a peak expert of the Phoenix Cry Empire, how could Marquis Ying have failed to notice?Since he must have known and hadn\u2019t said anything, it was likely that he had participated in it. In fact, perhaps he had been the one to do it.If it had been him who had placed those foreign spiritual energy seeds inside Chu Yao, then was it possible that Marquis Ying had also been the one to steal his cultivation ability? Why would he do that? Was it just to ruin them? Or was there a bigger reason?All these questions spun in Long Chen\u2019s head, giving him a splitting headache. But there was no way for him to figure it out.\u201cWhatever. No matter how cunning a fox is, they\u2019ll have to reveal their tail at some point. What I need is to become a true hunter so that when they do reveal themselves, it won\u2019t be me who is the prey.\u201dAfter coming to this conclusion, Long Chen no longer focused on those questions. Returning to his room without even daring to go over to where his mother was, he directly entered seclusion.But as soon as he began to circulate his cyclones, he jumped up, almost knocking into the ceiling.\u201cThis is too ridiculous.\u201dLong Chen looked into his Dantian. His ten cyclones had already stopped growing now, but each cyclone had already reached a terrifying circumference of a whole meter. It was truly shocking.They were on a completely different size compared to the previous cyclones. Under their slow circulation, heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi flooded into his FengFu Star. This speed was at least a hundred times greater than before.He was both shocked and pleased. But after just cultivating for a breath\u2019s time, he realized that there was one problem.Those ten cyclones were like ten huge drains that sucked up spiritual qi. The surrounding spiritual qi was unable to satisfy the demands of the ten cyclones\u2019 absorption, causing the spiritual qi in the air to become thinner.He was only absorbing a tenth of what he should be able to.\u201cNo, I have to find somewhere else to cultivate.\u201dOn that very night, Long Chen covered up his aura and stealthily left the city. Using the Windchasing Steps, he was just like a wisp of smoke that went directly towards Sunset Mountain.Sunset Mountain was completely quiet at night. The scenery was as it was before, but Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel somewhat moved upon seeing it again.The first time he had come here was with Meng Qi. Thinking of her absolutely perfect beauty and that gentle gaze of hers, his heart became aroused.The second time he had come was while trapped in Chu Yao\u2019s net. Her revengeful state turned into one of gentle charm.Now, Meng Qi was in some unknown faraway place. He had no idea how she was doing. Perhaps, she had already forgotten about him\u2026There was also that crap-brother Xi who had almost killed him. Thinking about that idiot caused him to become enraged. It was as if that arrogant figure had appeared before him again.Meng Qi was far away, Chu Yao was under house arrest, and he was all alone. That was simply the cruel reality. Without power, life couldn\u2019t be called living; it was just barely managing to survive.If you wanted to live with dignity, then you had to have a matching strength. That was the reality. Looking at the scenery around him, Long Chen took a deep breath.Sitting down lotus-style on a huge stone, he gently circulated his cyclones. In the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the spiritual qi in this area also became too thin to keep up.But the spiritual qi here was at least twice as dense as the one at his home, so he hadn\u2019t wasted his time by coming here.Two days later when the first ray of light came from the east, Long Chen\u2019s body emitted an explosive sound. He slowly opened his eyes, a strange expression appearing on his face.He had actually once more condensed a cyclone. Eleven cyclones!This Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, just how many cyclones could it condense?Seeing the cyclones in his body growing once more, Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel worried. This was absolutely insane. If all he did was to continue condensing cyclones, he really might go insane.As he returned home, Long Chen thought about it and decided to make a trip to the alchemist guild to get several medicinal ingredients first.Arriving home, he arranged the medicinal ingredients in front of him. A kind of anticipation filled him. It was the time for him to test his new Pill Flame.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His pill furnace shook violently before slowly calming back down. A bright ray of light shot out when the furnace lid was opened.Inside the pill furnace was a pearl-like medicinal pill. High grade medicinal pill! He had finally refined a high grade medicinal pill!Low grade pills were judged by the pill fragrance, mid grade pills by their pill lines, and high grade pills by their halo of light. That light was a sign of the medicinal energy being firmly locked within the pill. Other than grandmaster Yun Qi, there was definitely not a single person within Phoenix Cry who could refine a high grade medicinal pill.\u201cThe light is still a bit faint, most likely meaning that my control over the Pill Flame still isn\u2019t perfect. But the lack of flaws is already enough to make it high grade.\u201dLong Chen was filled with pride as he looked at this high grade medicinal pill. That pill was called the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill.The formula had come from his Pill God memories. Although it was just a second tier medicinal pill, the pill formula had already disappeared from this world. What Long Chen had in his possession was one of a kind.He carefully collected that high grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill as well as the remaining lower grade ones. He had spent a whole night refining, exhausting himself slightly in the process.There were still two hours until daybreak. Long Chen closed his eyes and slowly recovered his exhausted spiritual energy.After refining the beast flame, his Pill Flame had become over ten times stronger. But to control it was greatly exhausting to his soul.This was also due to him not being very familiar with the beast flame. Thus, the toll was even greater and he needed to rest.As soon as the first ray of light sprinkled itself over the capital, he slowly opened his eyes.After eating breakfast, Long Chen brought the medicinal pills he had refined straight to the Huayun Pavilion. Today was the starting date of their yearly auction.But the auction would only begin at noon. This kind of large auction continued for three days, so there was no one rushing to get there. Long Chen was the first guest to arrive.The Huayun Pavilion was located in the northern part of the city. But even from other parts of the city, you could see a majestic building hundreds of meters tall.As soon as he entered the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s lounge, four pretty maidens came to greet him.\u201cWelcome mister. May I ask\u2026 oh!\u201dThose maidens were all used to receiving guests, but when they saw it was Long Chen, they all let out a startled cry.Long Chen was surprised at that. He checked his clothes, but he had just changed clothes right before coming here so there shouldn\u2019t have been a problem.\u201cHey, what\u2019s with all the noise this early in the morning? Did you forget all your training\u2026 ah, young master Long Chen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Fu Gui,\u201d laughed Long Chen.That was the person who had sent Long Chen the invitation to the auction. The reason Long Chen still remembered his name after all this time was because of how peculiar it was.That was a kind of name that rich families would give their pets. But in any case, this Fu Gui had managed to succeed in making others remember his name as soon as they met. That was enough to say that he was a remarkable salesperson.[1]Fu Gui was delighted that Long Chen had come. The most important thing for him was that he had already used up his three quotas.One had been given to a roaming knight whose power wasn\u2019t bad. The other had been given to a rich merchant. But as the time drew closer to the auction, he found out that those two didn\u2019t have much interest in auctioning anything. In other words, it was likely all his work had gone to nothing.But there was also nothing he could do. After all, all those high-class clients had already been pulled over by the higher-ups.So, now Fu Gui had placed all his hope on Long Chen. But ever since Long Chen had received his invitation, he had never contacted him again.Fu Gui had already been filled with despair now that the auction was starting today. He had thought that he wouldn\u2019t have any hope of getting any profits this year.But seeing Long Chen\u2019s arrival now, he quickly became excited.\u201cYoung master Long Chen, I actually thought you forgot about this matter,\u201d laughed Fu Gui excitedly.\u201cHaha, my bad. I\u2019ve just been too busy recently. By the way, I brought some stuff over. Call over your appraiser and let\u2019s talk about the auction. After all, we\u2019re cutting it a bit close,\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cGood, come with me young master Long Chen.\u201d Fu Gui was overjoyed to hear that Long Chen had brought things to be auctioned. He quickly brought him inside.The remaining four maidens had all been looking at Long Chen foolishly, all the way up to the point that he disappeared from their views.\u201cHeavens, I actually saw a person of legends.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the number one junior generation of the empire! He was close enough to touch\u2026 I could die of happiness.\u201dLong Chen was led by Fu Gui into a very luxurious private room under their stealthy gazes.As soon as they entered that private room, a woman in elegant robes walked in and curtsied to Long Chen. She then warmed and steeped some tea with her tender jade hands. She was actually a master in the art of tea.\u201cYoung master Long Chen, try some tea for now. I\u2019ll quickly go find an appraiser. What exactly do you need to appraise?\u201d Fu Gui asked carefully. Each appraiser had their own specialties.\u201cMedicinal pills.\u201d Long Chen smiled slightly.Although Fu Gui had long since expected that, to actually hear it still caused his eyes to brighten. \u201cPlease wait a moment. I\u2019ll go find an appraiser immediately.\u201d\u201cLord, please have some tea.\u201dThat tea master handed him a teacup. Before the tea had even been poured, the smell of tea had already drifted over.\u201cGood tea.\u201dLong Chen took a sip. As soon as it entered his mouth, its gentle warmth spread throughout him and the taste even stirred his spirit.\u201cIt\u2019s a good tea, and the one serving it is even better.\u201d Long Chen looked at the tea master and laughed.The woman reddened slightly. She began to act in an extremely lovable manner, but as soon as she did, that initial interest Long Chen had had in her immediately disappeared.That woman\u2019s tea skills were extremely exquisite. Her timing and control of the temperature and pouring caused Long Chen to feel a bit of admiration for her. After all, all craftsmen were deserving of respect.But when she switched to that act of hers in order to make men fall for her, Long Chen\u2019s admiration turned to disgust. He no longer even drank the tea and simply closed his eyes.That tea master immediately became embarrassed. She hadn\u2019t thought that her techniques she had honed thousands of times would fail.She actually didn\u2019t recognize Long Chen as the empire\u2019s number one celebrity. She had already passed the age where she chased after dreams.Luckily, that awkward atmosphere didn\u2019t last for long before Fu Gui returned along with a senior in his sixties.That tea master hastily retreated as soon as the two of them arrived. When the senior came in, he immediately brushed his hand over his chest, an etiquette reserved for alchemists.\u201cGreetings young master Long Chen. I am Qian Fu[2], a Pill Apprentice. Please give me some pointers.\u201dLong Chen was speechless. A businessman was very suited to such a name. He also replied with an alchemist\u2019s etiquette and said, \u201cSenior is too modest. When it comes to refining pills, senior is much more experienced.\u201dAfter the two of them exchanged their formal etiquettes, Long Chen got straight to the point. \u201cThis time, I want to auction off several medicinal pills. Take a look.\u201dLong Chen handed over a jade bottle to Qian Fu, and he carefully received it. He put on gloves and also took out a jade plate in which he poured out a pill.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dAs soon as he saw the pill, he could tell it was a middle grade second tier medicinal pill. But he was then immediately dumbstruck as he actually didn\u2019t recognize it.Although Qian Fu\u2019s talent was limited and he was only a Pill Apprentice, he had seen countless medicinal pills during his lifetime. Otherwise, there was no way he would have become the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s first-rate appraiser.But now just a second tier pill had stumped him. He looked at it forever, even taking out a few small testing tools.After a bit, Qian Fu\u2019s expression became a bit embarrassed. He didn\u2019t know what this pill was, which was a slap in the face to his status as an appraiser.Qian Fu\u2019s display was within Long Chen\u2019s expectations. This Flesh Bone Restoration Pill was an extremely unknown kind of medicinal pill according to his Pill God memories.Long Chen had had to refine 217 medicinal ingredients in order to condense it.Those ingredients might not have been all that precious, but that pill formula was exceedingly amazing in the manner that it managed to add up the different medicinal ingredients\u2019 energy to form a unique effect.Sometimes, there were only a couple of things that needed to be refined. Sometimes, there were just a dozen ingredients that needed to be refined into powder and then, combined together in specific ways in order to refine a pill. But the difficulty of this pill was something many people could only lament at.When he had refined the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill, it was the first time Long Chen sensed how broad and profound the Pill Dao was. Various medicinal ingredients could be refined together to have different effects. To be able to find the correct combinations and processes was a god-like craft.\u201cCough, if I\u2019m not mistaken, then this should be a healing pill with shockingly great effect.\u201dAlthough he wasn\u2019t able to say the name of the pill, Qian Fu still managed to figure out its effect after examining it for so long. He was not an incompetent appraiser. However, he was unable to tell exactly how great the pill\u2019s effect was.His face was rather red. If he wasn\u2019t able to say what its effect was, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring it out to auction. If even he wasn\u2019t clear on its effect, then wouldn\u2019t it be like cheating others to bring it out to auction? That would greatly hurt the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s reputation.Qian Fu had spent over thirty years as the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s medicinal pill appraiser. He had read through countless tomes and archives. He knew third tier pills and below like the back of his hand. But today had completely toppled his confidence.\u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry young master, but I am unable to state the name of this medicinal pill, and I\u2019m not clear on its exact medicinal nature. Therefore, we cannot accept this pill.\u201dLong Chen didn\u2019t overly react to this. However, Fu Gui\u2019s face was completely green. If Long Chen had nothing to auction, then his profit this time would fly away.\u201cThis medicinal pill\u2019s name is the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. It\u2019s a marvelous medicine for treating outer wounds,\u201d smiled Long Chen.\u201cI truly am sorry, but even if you say its name, we still can\u2019t accept it.\u201d Qian Fu once more apologized. He had no other choice since he couldn\u2019t risk the reputation of the entire Huayun Pavilion.After all, it wasn\u2019t as if they could accept whatever he said. If there was even the slightest error, all of Qian Fu\u2019s future prospects would sink.\u201cNo problem. The main thing is that you aren\u2019t able to estimate the medicinal pill\u2019s exact nature, right? I can show it to you,\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cShow it to us?\u201d Qian Fu and Fu Gui were both puzzled.\u201cSorry for this.\u201dLong Chen suddenly took out a long blade and in front of their shocked expressions, chopped it at Fu Gui.Blood splattered everywhere.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 AuctionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeThe midday sun shined down upon the Huayun Pavilion, making it appear even more majestic and grand than usual. Even though it was scorching hot, countless people still flocked over.At the front of the Huayun Pavilion was a huge auction hall that was already completely full. Those who were capable of being invited over were all extremely rich, had high statuses, or were true experts.\u201cHaha, this is my first time attending the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s auction. It really is exciting.\u201d Shou Hou was in a private room looking out towards the outside eagerly.Shi Feng, Fatty Yu, and the others weren\u2019t much better than Shou Hou at controlling their excitement. They could see out of their glass room, allowing them to clearly observe every single thing that was happening outside, but no one was able to see into their glass room.They could see that all the famous and powerful people within the capital had come. Normally, those were people they could only look up at, but now those people were only able to sit amongst the crowd while they sat in a private room above them.\u201cWe only got here because of Long Chen\u2019s fame. Otherwise, we probably would never get to have this kind of treatment in our entire lifetime.\u201d Shi Feng sighed.Shi Feng had already made a complete recovery. But despite that, Shi Feng had still never received such a hard blow.After that loss last time, Shi Feng had worked hard to recover and managed to profit from the disaster. His determination had become even stronger, and he had broken through repeatedly, advancing to the third Heavenstage of Blood Condensation. He was only one step away from entering the mid Blood Condensation realm.Even Shi Feng\u2019s father was merely at the mid Blood Condensation realm. Thus, he had great expectations on Shi Feng.Actually, the reason Shi Feng was able to advance so quickly was both because of his own effort and also because of Long Chen\u2019s medicinal pills.Shi Feng\u2019s defeat and suffering had been due to his relationship with Long Chen. That had caused Long Chen to feel a bit ashamed, and he had secretly given Shi Feng a Foundation Establishment Pill.That had allowed him to completely stabilize and steady his foundation. The powerful medicinal effect had allowed him to easily break through his shackles, allowing him to repeatedly advance.\u201cRight, why would the Huayun Pavilion treat you so importantly, brother Long? Why would they give you such a luxurious room?\u201d Shi Feng was a bit puzzled.The auction hall could fit tens of thousands of people, but there were only just over ten private rooms. Those were reserved for exceedingly important guests. It was reasonable to say that Long Chen had yet to reach the position where he was qualified for a private room.\u201cYou think they gave us a private room for nothing? Once the auction starts, we\u2019ll have to start spending some crazy money,\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible! Everything at this yearly auction is incredibly valuable. Even if we sold ourselves, we still wouldn\u2019t be able to buy anything,\u201d said Shi Feng.\u201cHmph, we couldn\u2019t auction you off even if we wanted to. With your figure, it\u2019d be better to sell you in pieces,\u201d joked fatty Yu. \u201cWe\u2019re with brother Long! What are you worried about?\u201dLong Chen laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one\u2019s going to come and kick us out. Oh? Even he has come.\u201dWhat surprised Long Chen was that he suddenly saw a familiar figure - Xia Changfeng.Long Chen ground his teeth. That bastard still hadn\u2019t left! The current Xia Changfeng had already returned to his free and easy manner. He was currently laughing and talking with crown prince Chu Yang.Behind them was also a beautiful woman - the one Long Chen had defeated in a pill battle, Xia Baichi.There were also several guards around them. Those guards were all young and under the thirties, but despite that, they were all Blood Condensation experts.And when Long Chen\u2019s gaze fell on one of those men, he felt a familiar spiritual fluctuation.That fluctuation caused him to think back to the beginning when he had defeated Li Hao. A man in a bamboo hat had used a secret weapon to kill Li Hao to prevent him from leaking any secrets.He had been wearing a hat that had covered his face, and he had moved extremely quickly, but as an alchemist, Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength was extremely sensitive.He didn\u2019t need to see that person\u2019s face. He could rely solely on that spiritual fluctuation to identify that person. That was because each person\u2019s spiritual fluctuation was different. This was a special ability of alchemists, similar to a scent dog\u2019s nose. He could not be mistaken.\u201cSo, he\u2019s actually one of the crown prince\u2019s people.\u201d Long Chen\u2019s eyes narrowed. Could Chu Yang be the mastermind behind all this? But even as he came up with this thought, the crown prince had already brought Xia Changfeng into another private room.\u201cLook, the fourth prince has come too!\u201d said Shou Hou.Looking through the glass walls, Long Chen saw that the fourth prince had also come with another group of princes. However, he didn\u2019t see Chu Feng. Most likely he was holed up cultivating.The fourth prince and the other princes also entered a private room; however, it was a different private room than the one the crown prince and Xia Changfeng had entered.\u201cHehe, today we get to feel how the princes feel every day,\u201d joked Shou Hou. For them to be able to also sit in a private room just like people on the level of the princes was a very great honor.They all knew that the reason the princes could enter a private room was because of their high statuses and how much money they possessed.At this moment, a slender man walked into the auction hall. He had a fair complexion, and despite being already in his forties, he still appeared very handsome.But that handsomeness seemed rather feminine. For this kind of femininity to appear on a man caused Long Chen to feel a bit cold.As soon as that person entered, the noisy hall immediately became much more suppressed. Many people completely shut their mouths.\u201cThat person is one of the most powerful experts in the Phoenix Cry Empire. Marquis Ying Zhao,\u201d said Shi Feng with some difficulty.Marquis Ying Zhao, Martial Wu Yi, and Marquis Long Tianxiao were the three top experts in the Phoenix Cry Empire. Normally, they were called Marquis Ying, Marquis Wu, and the Border Suppression Marquis.Long Chen\u2019s heart shook, and he turned to get a better look at that feminine man. That person was just as famous as his own father.At the same time, he recalled what Chu Yao had told him about Marquis Ying being in charge of their training. He didn\u2019t know if it was that person who had given him his own affliction.As Long Chen was examining Marquis Ying, Marquis Ying suddenly raised his head to look over at his direction. A ray of light shot out of his narrow eyes, and his gaze seemed to penetrate straight through the wall.Long Chen\u2019s heart jumped. His perception truly was sharp, worthy of being one of the top experts in the Phoenix Cry Empire. Although he wasn\u2019t a pill cultivator, his sensitivity and perception were shocking.After glancing over at their private room, Marquis Ying acted as if nothing had happened and walked into another private room.A couple of shocking people also arrived one after another and were allowed to enter a private room. According to Shi Feng, those people included a rich merchant as well as some authorities.Long Chen nodded. The Huayun Pavilion\u2019s auction was only for rare, expensive items\u2026 Having such high-end customers was completely normal for them.\u201cWelcome everyone to our Huayun Pavilion\u2019s yearly meeting. I am the chief auctioneer of the Huayun Pavilion.\u201dA flowery voice rang out and drew the attention of the hall. The curtain on the stage was slowly pulled to the side, revealing a gorgeous lady.That lady immediately drew out the crowds startled cries. Her beauty was absolutely shocking.She appeared around twenty-five years old. Her elegant, narrow eyes and exquisite face were extremely seductive.The most extreme thing about her was the skintight clothes she was wearing. They were rather low-cut, allowing people to see the pale tender skin beneath.Perhaps, if that had been all, it would have been fine, but the most frightening thing of all was her deep cleavage that seemed to invite people to jump in.But since she was standing on the stage, it was impossible to get a good view. Quite a few people stealthily stood up to their tiptoes before helplessly sitting back down depressed. They looked up at the private boxes that had a high vantage point and couldn\u2019t help being jealous.The eyes of fatty Yu, Shou Hou, and the others almost jumped out. Even Shi Feng\u2019s gaze turned a bit lifeless. The few of them were completely plastered to the clear wall. Long Chen was even a bit worried that they might press too hard against the wall and tumble down.But Long Chen also acknowledged that this woman was extremely beautiful. Although she couldn\u2019t compare to Meng Qi, she might even be a bit more attractive than Chu Yao.Of course, while part of this was due to her innate charm, another part was due to her mastery of dressing herself up to accentuate her advantages. With this skintight clothing that basically hid nothing, her beauty was practically destructive, elevating her from just sixty percent beauty to over a hundred percent.Long Chen patted fatty Yu\u2019s shoulders and scolded, \u201cCan you guys grow up a bit?\u201dShi Feng and the others all recovered themselves and quickly stepped back. Fatty Yu lightly said, \u201cBrother Long, don\u2019t worry. The wall\u2019s very sturdy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the wall, I\u2019m worried that if you keep looking, then drool might cover the floors.\u201d Long Chen pointed to a pool of saliva.Their faces all turned red, and they hastily returned to their seats. They also couldn\u2019t help but admire Long Chen\u2019s self-control.That woman was clearly already used to the crowd\u2019s reaction and didn\u2019t seem uncomfortable at all.Instead, she actually announced grandly, \u201cI am Yao Niqian and you can call me Niqian. I hope all of you will look after me as I take charge of this time\u2019s auction.\u201dAfter saying this, Yao Niqian gracefully curtsied slightly, and the landscape that originally could only be seen from the private boxes was revealed to all.A huge uproar immediately exploded from the crowd below. But unfortunately for them, Yao Niqian\u2019s movements were extremely quick. Before everyone could completely react, she had already returned to her dignified standing position.Long Chen\u2019s admiration of the Huayun Pavilion only continued to grow. From Fu Gui, to Qian Fu, to the current head auctioneer, each of them were completely focused on making more money. It would be more direct to just call their auction the \u2018Give Me Your Money Auction\u2019.But Long Chen had to admit that this Yao Niqian truly was skillful. She was already completely able to control the men\u2019s hearts.Her enticing movements, her quick reveal before hiding it again\u2026 such a visual evoked all the men\u2019s desire.The auction hadn\u2019t even begun, but many of the younger people were already starting to breathe heavily.Now, Long Chen remembered what Fu Gui had told him at the beginning: through their auction\u2019s embellishments, all their wares would be sold at an incredibly high price. Long Chen now believed it.Looking at the scene, everyone was already following Yao Niqian\u2019s pace. She smiled and waved her hand; the center of the stage slowly opened, and a stone platform rose up.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 Golden Striped TigerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeFollowing Yao Niqian\u2019s movements, the stage split open like a blooming flower, and a small stone platform rose out.That kind of mechanism wasn\u2019t that exquisite, but the entire device was built out of ivory and was as pure as jade, causing it to truly shock quite a few people.A shining golden battle armor floated atop the stone platform.That battle armor was extremely thick, and from the golden luster, it had to weigh at least a hundred pounds. With such weight, neither Long Chen or even grandmaster Yun Qi would be able to keep it floating in midair with just Spiritual Strength.But when Long Chen swept his spiritual perception over it, he shook his head and scolded inside.That armor was actually being supported by some very thin props. Due to the length of the armor and its positioning, it perfectly blocked those supportive props from vision.Yao Niqian\u2019s charming voice rang out, \u201cThis golden armor was made completely out of gold with a small amount of \u2018wind copper\u2019. It comes from a famous craftsman, and its defense is shocking.\u201dA sword appeared in Yao Niqian\u2019s hand. She slashed the armor so quickly; it was like a thunderbolt in many people\u2019s eyes. A cold gale from the speed of the slash blew over everyone before they could even react, and a clear ringing came from the golden armor.Her slash just now completely shocked everyone. The Huayun Pavilion truly was strong; just an auctioneer was a Blood Condensation expert.And from her slash\u2019s speed, it was obvious there wasn\u2019t the slightest waste in her attack. She was a true expert of the Blood Condensation stage.A couple of those people who had planned on bringing that bewitching woman back into their homes immediately gave up.\u201cEveryone can clearly see I used my full strength yet was unable to leave behind a single mark on the golden armor. Its hardness is shocking,\u201d Yao Niqian said to the crowd.But looking at her bewitching eyes and recalling the huge gust caused by her slash just now, many people had already started to feel that she was the thing whose hardness was most shocking.\u201cThe golden armor is our first item this time. The minimum price is set at a hundred thousand gold coins. Each bid must be at least ten thousand gold greater than the last. The auction has officially begun!\u201dYao Niqian smiled slightly. She raised a small wooden mallet and lightly banged it before her.\u201c150,000!\u201d\u201c180,000!\u201d\u201c250,000!\u201dCountless bidders immediately leaped into action.But the auction had only just begun, so everyone was still very reserved. The prices only went up by tens of thousands.However, due to how many people there were, the price continued to rise. Even Shi Feng wasn\u2019t able to resist the temptation and shouted out two bids, but he was quickly drowned out.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. Businessmen truly were all evil.They truly were planning on plucking away everyone\u2019s money. This golden armor would definitely be sold for over a million.That was why Yao Niqian had tossed out such a low starting price. It was in order to slowly entice everyone and gradually excite everyone\u2019s moods.This was just like boiling a frog. If Yao Niqian\u2019s display was too seductive, many people would be on alert inside. Although most men thought with their lower halves, it didn\u2019t mean all people were fools.Now, Yao Niqian was acting extremely tranquil. She would only occasionally say several words. But whenever someone shouted out a high price, her roving gaze would always brighten and pause over that person for a while.\u201cGive up Shi Feng. That thing is definitely not cheap. Don\u2019t be fooled by the beginning price,\u201d advised Long Chen.Although that golden armor looked good for an auction, and its defense was irrefutable, it wasn\u2019t actually that practical. It was only useful in small battles. In a large battle, who would wear such a gaudy armor? And if you were to wear such a cumbersome heavy armor at other times, you would be asking for death.And even if it was a small battle, if you were to wear such a shiny armor without the strong enough martial might, it would also be no different than asking for death.In a battle between armies, the main hope was to kill the opposing officers. Wearing something that gaudy would inevitably attract trouble.Frankly speaking, this armor was just for looks. If it really was something good, the Huayun Pavilion wouldn\u2019t be foolish enough to bring it out as the first item.Normally, the first item to be auctioned was always the hardest to pick for the auctioneers. It had to attract people\u2019s eyes, but it couldn\u2019t be too expensive. Otherwise, it might negatively impact the items following it.And thus, this golden armor, which appeared awe-inspiring yet didn\u2019t have much use, had been chosen to start the auction. As expected, it ended up attracting quite a few people.After Shi Feng heard Long Chen, he also gave up on it. Originally, he had thought that with a starting price of a hundred thousand, he should be able to get it for less than three hundred thousand. He hadn\u2019t thought of the other\u2019s shenanigans.In just a couple of breaths\u2019 time, the golden armor\u2019s price had already exceeded eight hundred thousand. And furthermore, the bids had yet to stop. This caused Shi Feng to completely give up any thoughts on it.\u201cDamn, are these even people anymore? How can they spend that much money?\u201d Shou Hou gulped.\u201cAll the people qualified to be invited here have the cash to spare. Just the first item is like this. I can\u2019t even imagine what kind of intensity the bidding will reach for the rest of the items,\u201d sighed fatty Yu.Although they were all part of the nobility as noble heirs, they were still speechless at the amount of gold coins being spent.Back when Long Chen had fought with Li Hao, the person with the most money in their group had been fatty Yu. He had saved all his money since his childhood and still only had eighty thousand gold coins.Just as they were sighing, the bidding of the golden armor easily broke through a million gold coins.\u201c1,050,000!\u201d\u201c1,080,000!\u201d\u201c1,150,000!\u201dEven after going past a million, there were still a dozen people bidding. They had been completely enraptured with the golden armor, and even their eyes had turned somewhat red.\u201c1,500,000!\u201dSuddenly, Xia Changfeng\u2019s voice came from his private room, calming down the bids by quite a lot.\u201cHe really is worthy of being the Grand Xia\u2019s crown prince. With just one look, he managed to see just how valuable the golden armor is. Are there any higher bids?\u201d Yao Niqian exclaimed in admiration.\u201c1,510,000!\u201d shouted a middle-aged man.\u201c1,800,000.\u201dXia Changfeng\u2019s voice was still as calm as ever, giving off the impression that he was just playing around. His voice caused others to feel uneasy.That middle-aged man\u2019s face became a bit unsightly. Shaking his head, he didn\u2019t continue bidding. It was obvious that one million eight hundred thousand gold coins had already surpassed his max.\u201cOne million eight hundred going once!\u201d\u201cOne million eight hundred going twice!\u201d\u201cSold for one million eight hundred thousand. Congratulations Grand Xia\u2019s prince! By purchasing this golden armor, you\u2019ve become the first winner of the auction this time. Congratulations!\u201dYao Niqian\u2019s words were perfectly tuned in order to let people feel comfortable and at ease. Long Chen had no choice but to admit she was a truly skilled businesswoman.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s just a bit of money. I wonder whether this prince has the qualifications to invite young miss to an evening meal?\u201d Xia Changfeng suddenly walked out of his private room and asked Yao Niqian to a dinner.\u201cRespected Grand Xia prince, this little one cannot bear such a glory. However, now is not the time to talk about that,\u201d laughed Yao Niqian.\u201cThis prince was too rude. Please continue,\u201d Xia Changfeng indifferently smiled. He returned to his private room confidently and with ease.A disdainful smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face when he looked at Xia Changfeng. With just his intelligence, he dared to have a battle of wits with a skilled woman like Yao Niqian?The second item was brought out, and as Long Chen had expected, it was not a \u2018flashy but useless\u2019 item like that golden armor.This item truly was not flashy; it was a deed to a plot of land. Long Chen didn\u2019t know much about it, but that deed caused quite a commotion when it was brought out.It seemed that deed truly was quite attractive to some of the people. That was also due to the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s brilliance.Their auction wares were meant to be attractive to everyone. Anyone who came to the auction would find something that they were interested in.The diverse items being auctioned were only collected by them after spending a year saving up. And for them to prepare such an auction, it naturally required a great deal of manpower.After the bidding competition, that deed was won by a rich merchant for eight million gold coins. When he obtained it, he went crazy with joy. It seemed that he had made a profit.Another three items were brought out. Although everything was very novel, none of those items drew Long Chen\u2019s interest.But what gave Long Chen a surprise was the sixth item; it was actually a living creature.A young tiger was trapped in a cage. It was five feet long, but its fur clearly showed that it had only just been born. Its eyes opened wide, and it looked extremely adorable.\u201cSecond rank Magical Beast - Golden Striped Tiger. Special golden stripes grow over its fur and will appear extremely beautiful once it has fully grown up. I\u2019m sure everyone knows that amongst second rank Magical Beasts, the Golden Striped Tiger is the easiest to tame. In other words, even someone without a cultivation base would be able to raise it. The Golden Striped Tiger only mates five times in its lifetime, so this infant is very precious. Everyone should take advantage of this rare opportunity. Infant Golden Striped Tiger, starting bid of five hundred thousand gold coins.\u201dAs soon as she stopped speaking, the crowd went crazy as they shouted out bids.\u201c600,000!\u201d\u201c800,000!\u201d\u201c1,100,000!\u201dOnce an infant second rank Magical Beast grew up, that would be equivalent to a Blood Condensation expert! Moreover, its combat ability would be even greater than most Blood Condensation cultivators. Who wouldn\u2019t be tempted?\u201cDamn, I really want it, but the price is definitely going to be sky-high.\u201d Shi Feng rarely cursed, but this time he couldn\u2019t help it. The Golden Striped Tiger was simply too attractive.It wasn\u2019t just Shi Feng; Long Chen was also tempted. Back then, he had especially admired Meng Qi\u2019s Magical Beast.Although he wasn\u2019t a Beast Tamer, as long as he raised this Magical Beast to trust him, then he would also be able to use it for fights.The current price had already broken through one million five hundred thousand when Long Chen suddenly shouted:\u201c3,000,000!\u201dLong Chen immediately doubled the price, causing quite a few people to give up. Three million was already a price to cause many people to shrink back, and the crowd became silent.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but celebrate inside. If it had continued by slow increments, three million would probably not have been able to stop everyone. Now that he had increased the price so sharply, it seemed he should be able to win.\u201c3,010,000!\u201dJust as Long Chen thought the infant Golden Striped Tiger would land in his hands, a woman\u2019s voice that was filled with hatred rang out.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The rest of the crowd was completely silent.In reality, an average Golden Striped Tiger\u2019s price was somewhere between two million to two million five hundred thousand. But due to the lack of supply, it wasn\u2019t something that could be bought so easily.As soon as the infant was taken from its mother, it had to be immediately sold off. Otherwise, if even just a couple weeks passed, the infant would have grown too much, and the difficulty in taming it would shoot up, making it not worth the price.That was why Long Chen\u2019s bid of three million was actually quite reasonable. Since such an opportunity was rather rare, it was worth it to spend a bit of extra money.Now that the price had surpassed three million five hundred, Long Chen had already given up on it. However, since it was Xia Baichi, he couldn\u2019t just let it go so easily.He needed to get the Starfusing Grass. It should be coming up extremely quickly, and if that idiot woman deliberately messed with him, the price of the Starfusing Grass might skyrocket past his reach.\u201c4,000,000.\u201d Long Chen ground his teeth, and a trace of anger had entered his voice.\u201c4,010,000.\u201d Xia Baichi seemed to have heard Long Chen\u2019s anger. Her mood improved greatly, and her voice even had some joy in it.Long Chen was even more sure that this idiot woman was trying to mess with him. She probably wasn\u2019t even interested in this Golden Spotted Tiger; her target was him.\u201c5,000,000,\u201d retorted Long Chen angrily.\u201c5,010,000.\u201dAs expected, as soon as Long Chen put his bid, Xia Baichi\u2019s voice would immediately follow. The crowd was watching both of the private rooms; everyone understood that the two of them were at odds with each other.\u201cThat woman is a Grand Xia princess. But as for the other private room, it sounds like he\u2019s very young. I don\u2019t think I recognize the voice.\u201d\u201cWow, do you even get any news? You don\u2019t recognize the voice of Phoenix Cry\u2019s number one warrior of the junior generation?\u201dWith this reminder, that person immediately understood. No wonder the Grand Xia\u2019s princess would go against him; so it was Long Chen!On the day of the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival, everyone had seen Xia Baichi lose to Long Chen, and she had fallen into disrepute. The reason everyone despised her now was because of Long Chen, so it was obvious that she was now aiming for him.Yao Niqian looked from Long Chen\u2019s private room to Xia Baichi\u2019s private room. No one knew what she was thinking, but a bright smile appeared on her charming lips.\u201cBaichi, don\u2019t waste too much. The auction has just started, and we still have to see whether there will be other good things in the auction later. We can\u2019t spend too much just for revenge against him,\u201d Xia Changfeng advised Xia Baichi.This was just the start. The best items had yet to appear, and if they were to run out of money too early, then they would only be able to watch as the precious items were taken away by others.\u201cNo, I definitely can\u2019t let him off after he humiliated me. I also lost the beast flame to that scoundrel. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll use my personal money. I definitely won\u2019t dip into yours.\u201d Xia Baichi was viciously glaring at Long Chen\u2019s private room.\u201cThen fine. But there will be plenty of opportunities in the future, so calm down a bit. Just let it go if he raises the price again.\u201dSeeing how obstinate Xia Baichi was acting now, Xia Changfeng also had no way to calm her down. He really didn\u2019t have any way to handle this younger sister of his. After all, she was a Pill Apprentice who could even be counted as having reach Pill Adept, and that status was even slightly greater than his status of a prince.Long Chen smiled slightly. If she wanted to play, then he\u2019d play. In any case, just waiting around was boring.\u201cCongratulations to princess Baichi on obtaining the infant Golden Spotted Tiger,\u201d smiled Yao Niqian. A couple of aides brought the infant down.Since the price for it had already reached a sky-high five million gold coins, there was no need for her to call out any \u2018going once, going twice\u2019. She directly skipped that, as it would only result in an awkward silence.Xia Baichi was surprised. When she realized that Long Chen had schemed to make her waste her money, she couldn\u2019t help but angrily curse, \u201cLong Chen, you definitely won\u2019t have a good death!\u201dWhen encountering a random crazy person\u2019s shouting and cursing, you absolutely could not try to argue with them. One, you\u2019d never be able to win an argument against an idiot, and two, even if you won, it would still be a kind of disgrace.So, Long Chen just laughed and hid inside his private room. He could imagine what Xia Baichi\u2019s current expression was.The auction continued, and all kinds of precious items and oddities were brought out, dazzling the crowd. But Long Chen was no longer low-key like he had been for the previous items. He practically shouted out at least one bid for every single item.The result was that as long as Long Chen bid, Xia Baichi would immediately follow. She would always bid an extra ten thousand against him, and for a while, the auction became just a battlefield between the two of them.\u201c1,800,000!\u201d\u201c1,810,000!\u201d\u201c2,500,000!\u201d\u201c2,510,000!\u201d\u2026Yao Niqian laughed to the side. She didn\u2019t say anything as both parties shouted with all their force.\u201cBaichi, stop making trouble. He\u2019s clearly just playing you. No matter how much money you have, it won\u2019t be enough,\u201d said Xia Changfeng angrily.Under Long Chen\u2019s enthusiastic help, Xia Baichi had already bought over a dozen items, most of them being absolutely useless to her. She had already spent over two hundred million gold coins.Xia Changfeng couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit regretful. Originally, Xia Baichi hadn\u2019t even wanted to come. Due to the details of her affair with Wei Cang spreading out to the whole city, she had kept hiding in her room without daring to show herself.But Xia Changfeng had wanted her to come out to this auction in order to get her out of the mood she was in, as well as for financial assistance to bid for the things he wanted. After all, as a Pill Apprentice, she had plenty of money.However, Xia Baichi had thrown out two hundred million gold coins in just a short time. He couldn\u2019t help but feel distressed at how much money she was wasting.At this time, Xia Baichi had also become clear-headed. No matter how much money she had, there was no way she could buy everything here. If she continued on like this, then she would just be playing into Long Chen\u2019s scheme.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so worried, princess. If you want revenge, wait until Long Chen truly goes for something. Taking revenge then won\u2019t be too late,\u201d smiled crown prince Chu Yang.\u201cYes, brother Chu Yang is correct. Since he has a private room, the Huayun Pavilion must expect that he is planning on buying some important things,\u201d advised Xia Changfeng.Hearing the two of them, Xia Baichi\u2019s anger calmed a bit. But her hatred of Long Chen only continued to grow.Ever since she had first met Long Chen, she had suffered defeat after defeat. Long Chen was her nemesis, completely suppressing her.Xia Baichi now stopped competing with Long Chen over the bids. Once the two of them calmed down, the auction once more returned to its normal state.At this time, the sky had already darkened. The auction paused temporarily in order to serve dinner. They opened the curtains, and hundreds of women walked out with dining cars covered in delicious foods and alcohol.This dinner was offered for free by the Huayun Pavilion. They were worried people might leave if they got hungry.\u201cBrother Long, we should go down too. To be honest, we were so nervous with what was happening with you and Xia Baichi that we\u2019re now incredibly hungry,\u201d said fatty Yu.\u201cNo need to go down.\u201dLong Chen shook his head. Two beautiful maids came in with a long table and set it down.There were dozens of rich dishes on the table. The smell coming off of them caused people to drool in anticipation.But that fatty Yu only foolishly looked at the two maids, completely forgetting his hunger.\u201cEveryone, please eat. We\u2019ll pour the alcohol.\u201d Those two maids paid no attention to fatty Yu\u2019s gaze. Their gazes swept over Long Chen with some delight.\u201cOh, so it\u2019s you guys.\u201dLong Chen was a bit surprised that these two were two of the four who had welcomed him when he had come to the Huayun Pavilion earlier.\u201cAh, young master Long Chen, so you actually remember us.\u201dThose two women were excited to be in his presence. One of them cast a furtive look around and then actually took out a small book.Her face was completely red as she asked, \u201cYoung master Long Chen, could you autograph this for me?\u201dLong Chen stared blankly. Taking the small book, his eyes widened. A tall, handsome man with sword-like eyebrows, starry eyes, and dancing black hair had been drawn on the cover.Looking closely at that man, it was actually eighty percent similar to him; however, it was more handsome and dashing than he was.\u201cIs this supposed to be me?\u201d asked Long Chen doubtingly.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know about it?\u201d Not just the two maids, but even Shi Feng and the others were surprised.\u201cThis is the hardcover limited edition of Phoenix Cry Divine Battle. It costs thirty-five gold coins! We used half our yearly salary in order to buy it. We\u2019re begging you! Please, can you sign it?\u201dFlipping open this Phoenix Cry Divine Battle book and seeing what was inside, even he exclaimed in admiration. Reading this book would involuntarily cause a person\u2019s heart to be excited. Even he had an urge to buy it.Seeing the writing brush the maids handed to him, Long Chen bitterly laughed, \u201cDid you guys plan this in advance?\u201dThe two maids blushed. His guess was right on. The two of them had run over to send Long Chen dinner just to see him.Brandishing the brush, Long Chen wrote his name boldly atop the cover. Back when he was unable to cultivate, his mother would always spend time teaching him reading and writing, so his calligraphy was extremely polished.And now that he could cultivate, all strokes of his brush would contain a vigorous grandeur and were filled with a sword-like will.The two maids were endlessly excited when Long Chen handed their book back to them. After thanking him vigorously, they hastily ran away. They didn\u2019t even bother with pouring the alcohol. Instead, they most likely rushed off to show it to their fellow maids.\u201cBrother Long, my family has collected several hundreds of that book. How about you help me sign each one?\u201d Shou Hou rolled his eyes and laughed at him.\u201cGive it up. With your carelessness, it\u2019s better to just keep them in storage. Aren\u2019t you planning on selling the ones brother Long signs for profit?\u201d One of the other noble heirs in their group disdainfully said.\u201cNonsense, am I that kind of person?\u201d Shou Hou angrily retorted. But looking at everyone\u2019s disdainful expression, his confidence faltered and he spread his arms. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure out how much brother Long\u2019s signature is worth.\u201d\u201cShut your mouth. Let\u2019s eat.\u201dLong Chen cursed and everyone laughed, starting to devour the food that had been brought over. After they finished eating, those two maids ran back and took away the dining table as well as offering the tea and fruits.In less than the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the auction once more began. Yao Niqian\u2019s charming voice rang out:\u201cThe next item in the auction is thousand-year-old Starfusing Grass.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the real reason he had come to the auction; he absolutely had to obtain it!If he could get the thousand-year-old Starfusing Grass, he would be one hundred percent certain of being able to refine an upper quality Starfusing Pill. And such a Starfusing Pill would have a one hundred percent chance of resolving the foreign spiritual energies within Chu Yao\u2019s body.Originally, Long Chen hadn\u2019t planned on using thousand-year-old Starfusing Grass; he had thought that just hundred-year-old Starfusing Grass was already good enough. After all, even just hundred-year-old Starfusing Grass was difficult to obtain. That was because Starfusing Grass was an essential ingredient in many different second tier medicinal pills.It was also extremely hard to gather Starfusing Grass, so it was in extremely low supply. Using ordinary Starfusing Grass vs thousand-year-old Starfusing Grass to refine pills simply could not be compared.For Chu Yao, he didn\u2019t care how much money he had to fork over. Originally, he hadn\u2019t thought that it would be a problem to obtain this Starfusing Grass, and thus, he hadn\u2019t attempted to try buying it through back channels.But truthfully, that most likely would not have worked anyways. The Huayun Pavilion refused all backdoor channels, since if news of that were leaked, it would hurt their reputation.Although the Starfusing Grass was rare, it wasn\u2019t as if there were many alchemists. Long Chen had been highly confident in purchasing it with his current financial ability.But now, that idiot Xia Baichi had decided to start messing with him\u2026 If he let her realize what his goal was, then that idiot woman would force Long Chen to fork out all his money, bankrupting him of even the clothes he was wearing.That was also the reason why Long Chen had shouted out a bid on every item before, no matter what it was. And as expected, she also shouted out a higher bid every time. He deliberately set himself against her, forcing her to lose money. That was him setting up for the Starfusing Grass.\u201cTen stalks of thousand-year-old Starfusing Grass, an essential ingredient for second tier medicinal pills. I don\u2019t need to explain just how precious such a thing is. The starting price is five hundred thousand gold coins!\u201d announced Yao Niqian.\u201c700,000!\u201d\u201c800,000!\u201d\u2026At least ten people immediately started bidding. Most of them were all elderly faces.Long Chen was familiar with a few of them. They were all the people he had seen in the alchemist guild. But they were all Pill Apprentices.There were a few unfamiliar faces, but they were most likely alchemists as well. Other people wouldn\u2019t know exactly just how precious such an item was or how to use it.\u201cTwo million!\u201dOne of the seniors had shouted a bid of one million eight hundred thousand and suppressed all the other bidders. Yao Niqian had begun to start her count when Long Chen finally shouted his bid.Originally, he had been praying that Xia Baichi would shout a bid before him. If he then bid against that, it would be seen as him trying to provoke her.That kind of situation had the highest chance of him obtaining it at the lowest price.But it appeared that the heavens were not in a listening mood. Despite being a Pill Apprentice, Xia Baichi had no interest in the Starfusing Grass, causing Long Chen to curse inside.\u201cLittle idiot sister, do you want to come out to test the waters?\u201d As soon as he shouted the bid, he also sent some indifferent words to Xia Baichi\u2019s private room.The crowd was quiet. Was Long Chen trying to use this as a pretext to intimidate Xia Baichi?\u201cDon\u2019t take the bait Baichi. He\u2019s intentionally trying to infuriate you.\u201d Xai Changfeng hastily tried to calm her down, afraid that she would get angry and once more foolishly waste money.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m an idiot? I won\u2019t fall for such an inferior trick,\u201d replied Xia Baichi coldly. She was filled with contempt for Long Chen.Hearing her reply, Long Chen celebrated inside. Of course, he didn\u2019t dare show that outside. In a peculiar voice, he said, \u201cLittle idiot sister, could it be that you\u2019re embarrassed about running out of money?\u201d\u201cYou! \u2026 Don\u2019t worry, this lady has enough money to bury you alive!\u201d Xia Baichi retorted angrily. She actually ran out of her private room and cursed right at Long Chen\u2019s private room.A stately imperial princess actually revealed her vulgar, uncouth side publically. Everyone\u2019s expressions were strange as they exchanged glances.Xia Changfeng\u2019s face darkened, hastily pulling Xia Baichi who was cursing madly back into the private room. This time, Xia Baichi had truly lost the Grand Xia\u2019s face.Seeing that the atmosphere had become a bit strange and suppressed, Yao Niqian hastily said, \u201cYoung master Long Chen bids two million. Are there any higher bids?\u201d\u201cTwo million going once.\u201d\u201cTwo million going twice\u2026\u201dLong Chen finally relaxed when he saw Yao Niqian begin counting down. It seemed he had managed to trick that idiot Baichi again.\u201cTwo million going\u201c\u201cThree million.\u201d A soft voice rang out calmly from another private room.Long Chen\u2019s expression changed, and he turned to look at that private room. If he hadn\u2019t remembered wrong, then that was Marquis Ying\u2019s private room!He wasn\u2019t a pill cultivator and also wasn\u2019t a merchant; he couldn\u2019t possibly know the true value of the Starfusing Grass!And Long Chen\u2019s bid of two million already counted as a high price. Although the Starfusing Grass was rare, it was something that could be collected if given enough time.If Long Chen wasn\u2019t in urgent need of it, he also wouldn\u2019t have offered such a price. But now Marquis Ying had raised the price by fifty percent!Although nothing could be obtained cheaply at an auction, this price was far too high. And more importantly, Starfusing Grass had absolutely no use to Marquis Ying.A cold light flashed in Long Chen\u2019s eyes. This Marquis Ying was even more difficult to handle than what he had thought. He had underestimated him; as one of the three peak experts in the Phoenix Cry Empire, he was truly worthy of having his name stand alongside his father. He had easily seen through his ruse.\u201cThree million ten thousand.\u201dLong Chen indifferently shouted out this bid. The only bidders were him and Marquis Ying. If he didn\u2019t give up, then his only choice was to continue until the end.\u201cHaha, I really did have some use for this Starfusing Grass, but since you want it, I\u2019d feel bad quibbling with someone from the junior generation over it. You can have it.\u201d Marquis Ying\u2019s soft, feminine voice rang out.Long Chen was filled with anger. This Marquis Ying was definitely an unscrupulous old killer!\u201cFour million!\u201dAs expected, as soon as Marquis Ying said that, Xia Baichi woke up and shouted out a new bid.Long Chen\u2019s face darkened. Fatty Yu and the others also had unsightly expressions. They could all tell that Marquis Ying had played a trick on him.\u201cThis junior does not dare accept your generosity. My father is an upright man who guards the wild border, protecting the empire and its people. I have my father\u2019s upright blood in my veins, so I simply cannot accept senior Marquis Ying\u2019s kindness.\u201dLong Chen originally didn\u2019t plan on saying these things. But being schemed against by Marquis Ying had immediately revealed his fatal weak point. Long Chen\u2019s anger exploded, and if he didn\u2019t say a bit, then he would feel too irritated.Long Chen\u2019s words caused the noisy crowd to become deathly silent. Only Long Chen\u2019s words continued to echo.Every member of the Phoenix Cry Empire felt that Long Chen was being far too brazen. How could he nakedly give a slap to Marquis Ying\u2019s face?Marquis Ying was one of the backbones of the empire. Even the Empress Dowager and the crown prince had paid deferential respect to him. In fact, even Long Tianxiao wouldn\u2019t be so impolite!Although Long Chen\u2019s words didn\u2019t have a single real curse or insult, anyone who wasn\u2019t an idiot could tell that Long Chen was implicitly cursing Marquis Ying.\u201cHaha, young people really are hot-tempered. You need to train more. If you can\u2019t hold your anger in for such small things, then you won\u2019t be able to grow up properly.\u201dWhat no one had expected was that the high and mighty Marquis Ying didn\u2019t show any anger at all and just indifferently laughed.Quite a few people sighed inside. He really was worthy of being one of the empire\u2019s apex experts. That kind of bearing was something no one could aspire to.\u201cFour million. Long Chen, are you embarrassed at your lack of money? Hahaha.\u201d Xia Baichi\u2019s ridiculing laughter came from the side.Xia Baichi wasn\u2019t actually stupid. With just a small prod from Marquis Ying, she realized that Long Chen actually greatly desired this Starfusing Grass.Having suffered such a loss before, how could Xia Baichi give up this opportunity to make things difficult for him?Long Chen took a deep breath. It really was the case of having your worries come true. Xia Baichi hated him deeply, so he would need to be prepared to bleed his money dry in order to obtain this Starfusing Grass.\u201cFive million,\u201d said Long Chen indifferently.An uproar shook the crowd. It seemed Long Chen viewed the Starfusing Grass as a must-have item; otherwise, there was no way he would make such a sky-high bid.\u201cTen million!\u201dWhat caused everyone\u2019s hearts to jump was that Xia Baichi was even more vicious and immediately doubled the price.Long Chen merely nodded. There was nothing else for him to think about. Who asked Marquis Ying to point out his weak point?He had to obtain the Starfusing Grass. Time was too pressing and he couldn\u2019t allow this chance to pass him.And even if Long Chen gave in now, with the temperament of that idiot woman, it would only be a disgrace for him.\u201cFifteen million!\u201d shouted Long Chen.\u201cEighteen million!\u201dXia Baichi immediately bid after him. She had already descended into madness. She no longer cared about money. All she knew right now was that if Long Chen wanted it, she would definitely not let him have it.\u201cTwenty million!\u201dLong Chen paused, but in the end, he still shouted out this bid. The entire crowd was shocked. That number couldn\u2019t just be randomly shouted! That was money! The price had already multiplied crazily, and even if it was just to relieve anger, wasn\u2019t that still too expensive?\u201cIf you bid again, I\u2019ll guarantee that this Starfusing Grass will be yours.\u201d After Long Chen shouted out his bid, his heart calmed.Having handed his medicinal pills to the Huayun Pavilion, he had obtained a twenty million credit limit. In other words, he had obtained a twenty million gold coin loan from them.Thus, after using up all that, he calmed back down. If Xia Baichi continued, he could only let the Starfusing Grass go to her.But he had also made another decision. If Xia Baichi dared to bid again, he wouldn\u2019t mind killing her for it.\u201cBaichi, that\u2019s enough revenge. Now that you\u2019ve raised the price so high, it\u2019s enough to relieve your anger.\u201d Xia Changfeng hastily pulled on Xia Baichi. He was afraid she would become too wound up and really spend twenty million gold coins on something completely useless to her.\u201cRight, Baichi, let it go. This time, Long Chen has suffered a crushing defeat. Your anger has also been relieved.\u201d Crown prince Chu Yang also advised her.Xia Baichi nodded. She also felt that some of her anger had been relieved now that she had forced him to buy it for ten times the price. And in truth, Starfusing Grass wasn\u2019t useful to her. Twenty million wasn\u2019t a small number so she was also somewhat unwilling to part with so much money.\u201cHmph, this lady will have some pity on a peasant like you. This trash medicinal grass is yours.\u201dLong Chen had finally succeeded in obtaining ten strands of Starfusing Grass for the sky-high price of twenty million gold coins. Although he was somewhat pained, he did relax slightly. Killing people for their treasure was definitely something he wouldn\u2019t do unless pushed to the breaking point.Following this, the atmosphere in the auction gradually heated up and the prices slowly climbed.After just two items had passed, a hidden door opened in Long Chen\u2019s private room and a man walked in.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 Mountain Splitting Battle-AxPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeAll the private rooms had a secret channel. After the guests in the private room successfully won an item, someone would come to send that item to them.There was no need to be like the people in the crowd who had to personally go behind the stage or to handle the transaction after the auction ended.The person who had come in was precisely the one who had pulled Long Chen into participating in the auction, Fu Gui. He was holding a foot-long case with ten stalks of Starfusing Grass that shined brightly like the stars.\u201cYoung master Long Chen, here are your goods.\u201d Fu Gui respectfully handed the case to Long Chen.To tell the truth, today was the most exciting day of his life. According to the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s rules, after subtracting a few business costs, he would obtain one percent of what Long Chen had spent.Just the money which Long Chen had spent just now had given him enough to spend the rest of his life without having to worry about money ever again.Long Chen carefully examined the case. Each stalk of Starfusing Grass had over ten starry spots.Starfusing Grass would gain an extra starry spot for every hundred years it was preserved. Thus, its age was something that was obvious at a glance.Although some mishaps had occurred today and he had a stomach full of anger, he had at least managed to obtain his goal, so it had all been worth it.Only after putting away the case inside his spatial ring did he relax. All the Starfusing Pill\u2019s ingredients had finally been collected. He could now start refining it.\u201cYoung master Long Chen, please wait a moment.\u201dSeeing that once Long Chen had stood up after collecting the Starfusing Grass, the astute Fu Gui immediately knew that he was planning on returning to his home.\u201cWhat? You want me to stay? But I\u2019m penniless right now,\u201d laughed Long Chen. He was itching to go refine pills. It was better to resolve Chu Yao\u2019s matter as soon as possible.\u201cYou\u2019re our guest, and when I was coming over just now, my boss said your credit limit could be raised by another thirty million. So if you see anything you like, feel free to bid,\u201d smiled Fu Gui. He handed a crystal card to Long Chen.Now Long Chen had two special crystal cards. But the twenty million on the other card had already been completely used up.The Huayun Pavilion had a special rule. Everyone participating in the auction would have to transfer their gold coins to the Huayun Pavilion in exchange for a credit limit.But they could only do that once. Once the auction started, you could not exchange for a higher credit limit. That was why most people would exchange as much money as they possibly could at the beginning in order to increase their spending limit.If you didn\u2019t buy anything or your credit had yet to reach the limit, the Huayun Pavilion would return your money to you without taking the slightest percentage.So every single person here had their own crystal card with all their money on it. Once the auction was over, the Huayun Pavilion would immediately take those cards back and deduct what they had spent. It was a very efficient process.For those like Long Chen who had used up all their money, the rule was that they could no longer add to their funds. But obviously, the higher-ups of the Huayun Pavilion had opened a special backdoor for him.Long Chen hesitated for a moment as he looked at the crystal card in his hand. Originally, he had been planning on going back to refine since he had no more money. Watching others spend while you had no money was also a kind of torment.But now that he had more funds, he truly was interested in the items that had yet to be auctioned.\u201cFu Gui, we already have an agreement that you won\u2019t immediately demand money from me if the things I gave you don\u2019t sell. I can\u2019t immediately return the money that you loaned to me in that case.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my boss has said that if those pills don\u2019t get auctioned off, the loan will just be written off as a gift to you,\u201d smiled Fu Gui.Long Chen was startled. \u201cWho is your boss?\u201d\u201cHehe, sorry, but this little one cannot reveal that. Please don\u2019t make it hard on me,\u201d apologized Fu Gui.Although he was a bit puzzled, Long Chen still decided to stay. He really was interested in the later items of the auction.After Fu Gui left, the auction paused for a moment and began to serve tea. Whether it was to the auctioneers or the guests, this kind of tense atmosphere truly did use up a lot of energy.Such a huge auction naturally had to give its guests some breaks. Only then would they have the energy for the even more intense bidding later.Otherwise, if everyone was exhausted, the auction would have a weak finish. Obviously, the Huayun Pavilion had already made preparations to avoid that.After a two hour break, the auction once more began. Calculating the time, the auction had already gone on for two whole days.Due to the competition being too intense, no one had really felt the time passing. Every item brought out was even more precious than the ones before it, and the bidding became increasingly hostile. The prices naturally shot up wildly as well.This was especially the case with Yao Niqian\u2019s \u2018encouragements\u2019. It was as if everyone had taken some kind of drug that made them go wild.Looking at the impassioned crowd, Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel some admiration. After two days of auctioning, this Yao Niqian had figured out the majority of the people\u2019s temperaments, and now the atmosphere was completely under her control.Shi Feng, fatty Yu, and the others had all been exposed to the grandness of the world. Even after these two days of auctioning, none of them were the slightest bit tired.Although none of them had the money to enter the competition, just watching those impassioned sky-high bids was stimulating on its own.\u201cThe next item is the Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax.\u201dAs she said this, a battle-ax was carried on top of the stage. But everyone was shocked when they saw it.Naturally, they all knew what battle-axes looked like. But they had never seen such a battle-ax before. It was absolutely enormous!That double-edged ax head was at least five feet long. It was as thick as an arm and possessed an imposingness that was absolutely terrifying.\u201cMountain Splitting Battle-Ax. It was made from golden sand, and its hardness is unmatched. It weighs two tons and is a symbol of power and martial might. It is said that it was the weapon of divinity, and placing it within your estate will scare off any spirits or ghosts. The starting price is two million.\u201dDozens of nobles immediately began to bid.\u201c2,010,000!\u201d\u201c2,050,000!\u201d\u201c2,080,000!\u201dIn truth, the battle-ax might be considered more of an ornament than anything else. Weighing two tons, it would be a miracle if you could even hold it, let alone wield it in battle.But Yao Niqian was not wrong; such a domineering battle-ax would definitely be a symbol of your status and power. The nobilities especially were interested in such an item.\u201cShi Feng, help me shout my bid,\u201d said Long Chen quietly.Shi Feng was startled. \u201cThat\u2019s just a household item. What are you buying it for?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I have my own use for it. Help me bid. If I do it myself, then that idiot woman will come to look for trouble,\u201d said Long Chen.At the very first moment he saw that Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax, he had thought of a certain huge figure - Wilde.With Wilde\u2019s physical strength, he should be able to use the battle-ax properly. That ax\u2019s weight was something extremely hard to find in other weapons, and it was also incomparably sturdy. It was practically perfect for Wilde to use.\u201c2,910,000!\u201d\u201c3,000,000!\u201d\u201c3,050,000!\u201dThe last bid was Shi Feng\u2019s. When others heard Shi Feng make such a high bid, they all shook their heads.Although it might possess a domineering might, it was simply an ornamental piece. Three million was already too high of a price. Three million fifty thousand was already something others were unwilling to bid against.Xia Baichi had been waiting to shout her own bid against Long Chen when she heard the voice coming from Long Chen\u2019s private room. But hearing that the voice wasn\u2019t Long Chen\u2019s, she hesitated and didn\u2019t bid against it.It was already the later stages of the auction. The wares being auctioned were becoming increasingly better, and if she ended up using all her credit limit, she would only be able to watch as those good things were taken away by others.Although she was suspicious that it was actually Long Chen, she wasn\u2019t completely certain, and after debating it for a moment, she still decided not to interfere.Long Chen celebrated when he saw the Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax be obtained so smoothly. Unfortunately, this item was something they were unable to bring into their private room, so Long Chen had to personally go get it.Long Chen followed the secret channel to below the stage. There were a dozen men guarding that place.His pupils contracted slightly when he saw them. Those people were actually all Blood Condensation experts.Just an auction already had so many experts. Then what was the true strength of the Huayun Pavilion?Long Chen arrived in front of the Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax. Looking at the huge battle-ax that was even larger than he was, he was truly stunned.Reaching out a hand, he slowly rubbed the handle. He noticed that he was almost unable to wrap his hand around that handle which was as thick as an arm.\u201cUP!\u201d Long Chen used his full force in an effort to raise that battle-ax. It shook slightly and slowly rose into the air, but after just rising it for three inches, it fell back down to the ground with a crash.The shelf that was originally holding it was immediately smashed into pieces. A huge explosion followed as it fell to the ground.\u201cWho would have thought that young master Long Chen possessed such divine strength. It really is admirable.\u201dThose guards had all been watching Long Chen. Originally, they had been looking at him with some disdain as he had spent so much on something that was only ornamental.But seeing him actually able to raise the ax with just one hand caused all their disdain to disappear.And even though he had dropped it in the end, it was still completely shocking. They were all clear on just how heavy it was. It required at least two people using their full strength to raise it like that.But Long Chen had succeeded in lifting it slightly with just a single hand. Plus, he had been holding it from the handle. The kind of force required to lift it from there was difficult to even imagine.That was why they had all opened their mouths to exclaim their admiration.Long Chen shook his head and bitterly smiled, \u201cThis thing really is just an imposing ornament.\u201d\u201cWho said it wasn\u2019t? It\u2019s so heavy; just who could manage to use it?\u201d One of them nodded.After confirming the huge ax\u2019s heaviness, Long Chen no longer showed off anything. He directly stored it within his spatial ring.Returning to his private room, Long Chen\u2019s indifferent expression became one of delight. That ax was definitely something Wilde could use.If he had used his full force, then even he would have been able to use it. But it would exhaust too much of his strength. Fortunately, Wilde wasn\u2019t the same. His physical body was the most abnormal one Long Chen had ever seen, and physical strength was his main forte.With this battle-ax, even without using spiritual qi, his battle strength would be absolutely terrifying.As time passed, the later items became even rarer and more precious. Natural treasures of heaven and earth, cultivation techniques, and medicinal pills, they were all available. The prices became even more frightening. There was practically not a single item that was sold for less than five million gold coins anymore.\u201cEveryone should look carefully at our next item.\u201dAn exceptionally confident smile appeared on Yao Niqian\u2019s face. She raised her hand, showing off what she was holding.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When it appeared, the whole crowd went silent for a moment before exploding into startled cries.Most of the people present all knew that every three years, the Huayun Pavilion would always have a Battle Skill as their final auction item. Counting the time, this was precisely the third year.If it was just an ordinary Battle Skill, it wouldn\u2019t have attracted so many startled cries. However, it was no ordinary Battle Skill. It was an Earth class Battle Skill!Earth class Battle Skills only existed in legends. They could only be found within the hands of sects that were isolated from the secular world.[1]It was rumored that the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s most precious treasure was just a portion of an Earth class Battle Skill. And only the imperial disciples could learn it.Thus, for most people, Earth class Battle Skills were things they had only ever heard of in legends. Now that they could personally see it, although they knew such a thing would not be obtained by them, it still was something that caused their hearts to jump wildly.\u201cEarth class Battle Skill - Three Style Parting Wind. Starting bid of twenty million.\u201dAn Earth class Battle Skill did not require much introduction. Just the \u2018Earth class\u2019 introduction was enough.\u201cThirty million!\u201dXia Changfeng\u2019s bid came from his private room. That was the first time Xia Changfeng had participated in the competition since the golden armor.Furthermore, he immediately increased the price by ten million. That kind of money spending style was quite shocking.Although Long Chen was attracted to that Battle Skill, he knew that it was impossible for him to obtain it. Xia Changfeng\u2019s thirty million bid was nothing. It was just the beginning.\u201cFifty million!\u201dAn aged voice came from inside another private room. The guest in that room had never revealed himself to the crowd so no one knew who was inside.Long Chen realized that the old man had probably come here expressly for that Battle Skill. Perhaps, now was the time for all the hidden tigers participating in the auction to reveal themselves and compete.\u201cSixty million!\u201dThis time, the voice was extremely sharp and uncomfortable to listen to, like the sound of metal scraping against metal. It came from a bearded, middle-aged man in the corner of the crowd.\u201cEighty million!\u201dThis time, it was the soft feminine voice of Marquis Ying.Now the crowd was extremely quiet. Other than Xia Changfeng, the mysterious elder, the bearded man, and Marquis Ying, no one else had enough money to compete against such a high price.\u201cOne hundred million!\u201dXia Changfeng took a deep breath and shouted out this price.Long Chen sighed in admiration. The Huayun Pavilion truly had a shocking amount of wealth. Just a copied, handwritten Earth class Battle Skill could be sold for over a hundred million.What was even more shocking to think about was that they could copy it countless times and auction it over and over at different places. As for the people who managed to obtain it in the end, they would all hide it away deeply so no one else could take it from them. Maybe they would even kill anyone who knew about it.This caused Long Chen to become more and more interested in the identity of the secret support of the Huayun Pavilion. Whatever the origin of that support was, it even allowed them to take out such a precious item without being afraid of others attacking in greed.Xia Changfeng\u2019s hundred million bid might be shocking, but it was immediately followed up.\u201c110,000,000!\u201dThis time, it was the mysterious elder in the private room. Considering that he had refused to show himself up until this point, it seemed he would not easily give up on obtaining this Battle Skill.\u201c130,000,000!\u201dThat bearded man was also unwilling to appear weak. Considering the current point in the auction, only bids by increments of ten million were worth anything.The rest of the crowd was completely silent. Only the astronomical bids continued to ring throughout the room.\u201c150,000,000!\u201d\u201c160,000,000!\u201d\u201c180,000,000!\u201dSuch high numbers actually tested a person\u2019s mental fortitude. Although it wasn\u2019t their money, when fatty Yu and the others heard them, it made it hard for them to breath.Sweat was dripping of Xia Changfeng\u2019s forehead. He had managed to learn from a secret backchannel that the auction this time would have an Earth class Battle Skill.Thus, he had brought all the money he had to increase his credit limit. But in total, he only had two hundred million. Since the price was already at one hundred eighty million, it seemed that his two hundred million wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201cBaichi, how much more credit do you have?\u201d He asked of Xia Baichi.Looking at her crystal card, she replied, \u201cI still have three hundred sixty million.\u201dXia Changfeng was overjoyed. \u201cGood sister, your brother\u2019s money won\u2019t be enough soon. Lend me some money and I\u2019ll return it when we get back to the Grand Xia.\u201dXia Baichi hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cI can lend it to you, but you must hand over Long Chen\u2019s head to me within a short time.\u201dXia Changfeng immediately felt awkward. Chu Yang was right there! To talk about murder in front of the crown prince was definitely excessive.\u201cBaichi, we\u2019ll talk about this when we get back.\u201d\u201cNo, if you don\u2019t promise me, then I won\u2019t lend you any money.\u201d Xia Baichi coldly snorted. She didn\u2019t give her older brother any face.Chu Yang smiled slightly. \u201cThis Long Chen is dislikable, and in this case, you\u2019ll be my younger sister\u2019s husband soon, so I won\u2019t hear anything you\u2019re saying now.\u201dHearing Chu Yang say such a thing, Xia Changfeng became much more at ease and he cupped his fists at Chu Yang. \u201cMany thanks, future brother-in-law.\u201d\u201cOkay, Baichi, I promise you. Give me your crystal card.\u201dOnly then did she hand him her crystal card. Drawing a line over his crystal card, Xia Baichi\u2019s credit limit was transferred over to his card. Now he had a credit of over five hundred million.\u201c300,000,000!\u201dSeeing that the price was continuing to climb, Xia Changfeng directly raised the price greatly in order to display that it was a must-have item for him and hopefully, intimidating his competitors away.The others became somewhat taciturn after that high price. Although an Earth class Battle Skill was extremely rare, it still was something buyable with money.Furthermore, the price for one was much lower than three hundred million. After all, most Earth class Battle Skills that were sold were all secondhand copies.This Earth class Battle Skill auctioned by the Huayun Pavilion was one that didn\u2019t exist in this region. That was why its price was so high.But the price of three hundred million truly was intimidating. After all, if you had enough gold, you could travel to somewhere far away and then, you would be able to buy Earth class Battle Skills for a much lower price.Now, the mysterious elder, the bearded man, and Marquis Ying were all hesitating.\u201cPrince Xia Changfeng bids three hundred million. Are there any higher bids? Three hundred million going once, three hundred million going twice\u201c Yao Niqian\u2019s voice was a bit excited as she started to count time.The profit from this auction had already surpassed her expectations. That was especially the case for this Earth class Battle Skill. The three hundred million bid was extremely exciting for her.Three hundred million should be the ceiling price for this Battle Skill; thus, she decided to start counting down.\u201c400,000,000.\u201dWhat no one expected was for a lazy voice to suddenly ring out.That voice was extremely young. It was Long Chen\u2019s voice! The entire crowd was stupefied, and even Yao Niqian was shocked.She had yet to even react when a small earring on her ear shook slightly. She immediately recovered and smiled.\u201cThat bastard.\u201d Xia Changfeng flew into rage. Just as he had been about to obtain the Earth class Battle Skill, Long Chen suddenly interfered.\u201cLong Chen, I don\u2019t believe a bastard like you has that much money. You\u2019re just looking for trouble!\u201d shouted Xia Changfeng angrily.\u201cIdiot, if I didn\u2019t have enough money, would I bid? Don\u2019t forget, this master is a Pill Apprentice,\u201d replied Long Chen.In reality, Long Chen had constantly been using his divine sense to keep track of his surroundings. Their two private rooms were only a few dozen meters away from each other. Although there was no way to hear what they were saying, by examining their lips, he was able to figure out the approximate details of what they were discussing.Seeing Xia Changfeng treat this Earth class Battle Skill as a must-have item, he had decided to shout out a higher bid.Although he appeared at ease on the outside, inside, he was still extremely nervous. If he scared Xia Changfeng off, then it would be him who had to pay the final bill.Four hundred million was something that an ordinary Pill Apprentice wouldn\u2019t be able to pay back even if they spent their entire life refining. But recalling how Xia Baichi had interfered with him and made him pay twenty million to obtain the Starfusing Grass, it would be depressing for him to let that go without revenge.\u201cFive hundred million! If you have the guts, then try to bid again!\u201d roared Xia Changfeng angrily. He was about to go mad with rage; he had no idea how Long Chen had obtained so much money.But according to the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s rules, if someone shouted out a bid higher than their crystal card\u2019s limit, they would be viewed as a troublemaker and be expelled from the auction.Seeing that nothing happened after Long Chen had made his bid, his only conclusion was that Long Chen really did have that much money.Xia Changfeng\u2019s angry roar echoed throughout the room like a beast\u2019s howl, shaking people\u2019s eardrums.\u201cDon\u2019t be so excited. I only had a little left on my card. If you had just added ten thousand then you would have won. I rarely admire someone, but I definitely admire prince Xia Changfeng. To use a hundred million as just ten thousand, you really are amazing.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s voice was filled with admiration. But in Xia Changfeng\u2019s ears, it turned into the most malicious taunt.\u201cYou!\u201dXia Changfeng suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood due to this intense anger. Startled cries came from his private room.The crowd\u2019s expression was somewhat strange now. For a moment, no one knew whether Long Chen had been speaking the truth or whether he had been deliberately provoking Xia Changfeng.\u201cSince no one else is bidding, congratulations prince Xia Changfeng, the Earth class Battle Skill is yours.\u201d Yao Niqian skipped right past counting down because she was certain no one would be as foolish as Xia Changfeng.Seeing that the Earth class Battle Skill had already been auctioned off, everyone started to get up and prepare to leave. But just at this moment, Yao Niqian\u2019s charming laughter rang out.\u201cIn the past, the auction would end with the Earth class Battle Skill, but this year we have an even more unusual item for the end.\u201dEveryone was shocked. What could be more precious than an Earth class Battle Skill? They all hastily sat back down and stared closely at the stage.Long Chen smiled. Hehe, a good show was about to start.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 Shocking MethodsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeYao Niqian banged her gavel. The red curtain behind her slowly opened, revealing a jade platform.That jade platform shined brightly; it was actually entirely made from the extremely rare Lantian jade.Lantian jade was exceptionally rare in the Phoenix Cry Empire. Only people with extremely high status could wear Lantian jade as accessories to display their grandeur.But now they saw an entire platform made of it. Just that platform alone had to be worth millions.Atop that perfect white jade table was a golden embroidered case which immediately drew everyone\u2019s gaze.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel admiration at how grand their methods were. The Huayun Pavilion actually used a table worth millions to show off a single item. If he hadn\u2019t known about this before, he would also be extremely curious.No wonder Fu Gui had been so confident back then when he had told Long Chen that the pavilion would take a fifty percent commision on the final price. It appeared they really did have the confidence to demand such an amount.They immediately grabbed hold of everyone\u2019s attention. Everyone was completely focused on that golden case.Yao Niqian smiled and slowly opened the case in front of their eyes, taking out something small from within.But people almost coughed up blood when they saw that it was just another small case inside the first case. Was there a point to this anticipation?!She carefully took out that small case. A maid hastily came forward and gave her a snow-white glove.Putting on the glove, Yao Niqian carefully opened the smaller case. Her cautiousness caused everyone to hold their breath, and it was so quiet that even the drop of a needle could be heard.A soft sigh of air escaped from the small case as it was opened.Following the opening of the case, projections appeared on the walls throughout the hall. All the walls became real-time projections of Yao Niqian\u2019s hand.Through those projections, people could clearly see that what was inside that small case was a round medicinal pill. A faint, ancient aura circulated around that pill.When Long Chen first saw that, he actually thought it was a mistake. But sweeping over with his divine sense, he immediately understood what was going on and practically prostrated himself to the Huayun Pavilion in admiration.\u201cThis medicinal pill is something that a small group of adventurers found within an ancient cave after fending off great danger. But that cave had many traps, and just for this medicinal pill, their ten-man group was almost exterminated. Only two of them managed to survive. As for the two survivors, one of them died shortly. Such a tragic story is truly sorrowful, and every adventurer is worthy of respect. They risked their own lives to scout out that extremely unknown area. They are true warriors.\u201d Yao Niqian\u2019s voice was somewhat subdued. Her eyes were red with tears bubbling up.Long Chen had been drinking tea when he saw that. He almost spat out that tea in shock. Wasn\u2019t this act of hers a little too much? That was the medicinal pill that he had given them!Of course, Long Chen had repeatedly warned them that they were not to leak the real origin of this pill. If they did, then he wouldn\u2019t sell it.And now it seemed that the Huayun Pavilion truly did keep their word. They had actually made up such a story and had done something to the outer layer of the medicinal pill. Now, the medicinal pill appeared extremely ancient, and their technique was so perfect that even Long Chen was unable to tell it was fake. The Huayun Pavilion truly had many experts.\u201cWhat is this medicinal pill?\u201d The people present were all powerful figures in their own rights. They naturally wouldn\u2019t care about the deaths of some adventurers. What they wanted to know about were this thing\u2019s price and effect.Yao Niqian wiped her eyes. Who knew whether or not she had been actually crying, but she quickly recovered to normal and said, \u201cThis medicinal pill is a pill from ancient times.\u201d\u201cAn ancient pill?\u201dEveryone present was extremely startled. Those ancient pills weren\u2019t necessarily medicinal pills refined in the ancient era, but more accurately, they were from pill formulas that were passed around from the ancient times.Most such ancient pills had already disappeared. However, they were extremely attractive to alchemists.If an alchemist could use the medicinal pill to extrapolate the pill formula, that would be equivalent to a new start for a lost inheritance, and that alchemist\u2019s name would ring throughout the land.\u201cAlthough this is an ancient pill, its age definitely does not surpass a hundred years. Everyone should be aware that a medicinal pill\u2019s effect and strength will not fade as long as it is less than two hundred years old. Therefore, this medicinal pill will still have one hundred percent of its effect,\u201d continued Yao Niqian.\u201cMiss Yao, don\u2019t keep us in suspense. Tell us the name of the medicinal pill! And tell us the effect as well.\u201d Seeing that Yao Niqian still refused to tell them the important part, someone finally ran out of patience.Seeing that everyone was sufficiently enticed, Yao Niqian smiled and said, \u201cThis medicinal pill has gone through our appraising master. Its name is the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. Now that you\u2019ve heard its name, I\u2019m sure everyone should know what its effect is.\u201dSighs of displeasure immediately followed.\u201cWhat, just that little effect?\u201d\u201cA healing pill? Isn\u2019t that too ordinary?Yao Niqian seemed to not notice their confusion, continuing, \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone knows my Huayun Pavilion\u2019s reputation. We naturally wouldn\u2019t make a joke of ourselves. If this Flesh Bone Restoration Pill really wasn\u2019t valuable, then we wouldn\u2019t have brought it out as the final and most precious item.\u201dHearing that, the crowd quieted down. She wasn\u2019t wrong; the Huayun Pavilion definitely wouldn\u2019t disrespect their own brand. Then, did that mean the medicinal pill had some sort of special use?\u201cIf I could be so bold, I\u2019d like to invite a Blood Condensation expert onto the stage to bear witness to the medicinal pill\u2019s effect.\u201d Yao Niqian smiled at the crowd.\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201dYao Niqian\u2019s charm went without saying. A man in his thirties immediately volunteered.Everyone felt this was rather strange. In all the previous auctions of the Huayun Pavilion, it seemed this was the first time anyone had been invited onto the auction stage.That man walked up to the stage. Due to the proximity with Yao Niqian and with how revealing her chest was, he couldn\u2019t help but stare fixedly.Yao Niqian smiled slightly and didn\u2019t bother about that. She playfully asked, \u201cIs master afraid of pain?\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t joke. I, Zhao Yang, have roamed the lands for so many years. It\u2019s offensive to ask me that.\u201d That man was a bit depressed now.Long Chen, in his private room, laughed at that.[1] Zhao Yang? Zao Yang? His name really was appropriate, as a tragedy was about to befall him.\u201cIn that case, Niqian will apologize in advance.\u201dSuddenly, a cold light flashed. A sword had appeared in Yao Niqian\u2019s hand, and she slashed it down too quickly to react.Blood splattered in front of everyone\u2019s shocked eyes. Zhao Yang\u2019s arm had been cut off at the elbow by Yao Niqian.\u201cYou!\u201dThat man hadn\u2019t even had the time to defend himself. With one of his arms cut off, he was about to angrily say something when a sword was pressed up against his throat, cutting him off.Everyone was completely shocked. Yao Niqian had always been acting so weak and delicate, and yet her attack just now had been exceptionally smooth. She was definitely an expert.\u201cSir has already said that he isn\u2019t afraid of pain. Here, take this.\u201d Yao Niqian handed him the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill.Zhao Yang was scared witless. He swallowed the pill without even thinking about it.\u201cWhat?\u201dStartled cries rang out as soon as he swallowed it. Almost everyone stood up to get a better look.Only then did Zhao Yang realize something was happening. Looking at his arm, he was shocked to see it miraculously growing back.In just the time it took for an incense stick to burn, his arm had completely grown back. Flexing his fingers, he was shocked to find that it was completely fine without the slightest feeling of unfamiliarity.He was absolutely shocked. If it wasn\u2019t for the bloodstained stage and his severed arm on the ground, he would have thought he was hallucinating.\u201cDamn, how could you waste such a precious medicinal pill like that?\u201d An old man had stood up, panting with rage. His eyes were practically spitting flames as he cursed at Yao Niqian.Other people also agreed with him. That medicinal pill was practically a divine pill. For it to just disappear like that enraged everyone.\u201cMiss Yao, are you trying to play us? Give us a clear explanation!\u201d Some people were unable to hold back their anger.As for Zhao Yang, he listlessly returned back to his own seat. Even now he couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. Occasionally, he would rub his hand over and over.Yao Niqian looked at the angered crowd and smiled. This result was even better than what she had hoped.\u201cEveryone, please calm down. Let me say it again, my Huayun Pavilion will not make jokes with our reputation.\u201dBanging the gavel, she caused everyone in the crowd to quickly quiet down. Actually, it wasn\u2019t because of her banging the gavel, but because a maid had come up behind Yao Niqian with an embroidered case.\u201cEveryone, altogether we had two such Flesh Bone Restoration Pills. But everyone should know that such a shocking effect is something that no one would believe even if I told you. So I could only show you. Please forgive me.\u201dThe crowd calmed down quite a bit after hearing that explanation. It was true; if they hadn\u2019t personally witnessed it, no one would believe that this world had a miraculous medicinal pill like that.Even having personally witnessed its effect, there were still many who still didn\u2019t dare believe their own eyes. Several people even went up to Zhao Yang to examine his arm. But that arm was clearly a new arm that had regenerated. There was no way it was fake.Plus, with the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s reputation, there was no way they would do something like selling fakes. But that pill was just too shocking. People had to be cautious about it.Long Chen nodded. These crafty unscrupulous business dealers had truly perfected their art.Yao Niqian opened the case, revealing a Flesh Bone Restoration Pill exactly the same as the last.\u201cFlesh Bone Restoration Pill, a second tier medicinal pill. I won\u2019t say any more about its effect, but I want to remind everyone that this medicinal pill is only effective in the Blood Condensation realm and below. We originally had two pills, but now after showing off its effect to everyone, this last one is completely unique. Starting bid, one hundred million.\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, a huge uproar exploded.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 Striking BackPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cTwo hundred million!\u201dA Blood Condensation expert was the first to shout out a bid. He hadn\u2019t gained anything today as a result of the bidding being so fierce.Due to the prices steadily climbing, the final prices had already exceeded their market value. Thus, he hadn\u2019t spent anything, which was currently his greatest advantage now.\u201cThree hundred million!\u201dAn aged voice came from a white-haired old man in the corner.That old man had never made a bid the whole time. But as soon as he spoke, everyone immediately recognized him.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the Tuoji Empire\u2019s grandmaster alchemist, Wang Luyang?\u201dAlthough the Tuoji Empire wasn\u2019t as large as the Phoenix Cry Empire and didn\u2019t have an alchemist guild, it had its own alchemy hall.If a nation didn\u2019t have the support of medicinal pills or martial weapons, it would eventually be destroyed. And martial weapons came second; after all, iron was never in short supply. However, medicinal pills definitely could not be lacking.That alchemist Wang Luyang was essentially the master of the Tuoji Empire. His status was even greater than their emperor.There was no way around that. Without the support of an alchemist, the Tuoji Empire would sooner or later be swallowed by one of the large neighbors.That was why as soon as Wang Luyang bid, it immediately scared off many people. That was because he was equivalent to an emperor. His financial resources were incredible.The reason he had never bid before was because he hadn\u2019t seen anything that interested him. A person like him wouldn\u2019t easily take action; but once he did, it would be a sure win.An ordinary second tier middle grade medicinal pill normally sold for three to four hundred thousand. But now the price had multiplied by a thousand, meaning that only a few could participate.Such a treasure was one that could only be found by luck. If someone lost an arm during a battle, then their combat ability would definitely sharply drop and they would eventually be killed.But the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill was equivalent to a life-saving treasure. Xia Changfeng and Xia Baichi were incredibly regretful that they hadn\u2019t prepared more money and could only watch as this treasure was purchased by someone else.\u201cFour hundred million!\u201dMarquis Ying\u2019s distinctive voice rang out. No one had expected that he would also participate.\u201cFive hundred million!\u201dWang Luyang didn\u2019t hesitate at all and immediately bid higher. That was his confidence. Although Marquis Ying was a noble, his financial resources were not as profound as Wang Luyang who controlled an empire.The entire crowd was stunned to find that an insignificant middle grade second tier medicinal pill was actually being sold at the same price as an Earth class Battle Skill.Even Long Chen felt his heart jumping wildly. It appeared this world had lost many pill formulas. Those ancient pill formulas in his Pill God memories were equivalent to an endless treasure trove.But he also felt a bit of worry. Just a Flesh Bone Restoration Pill could cause this much of an uproar.If others were to learn that this medicinal pill had come from him, that would definitely be dangerous. Perhaps he had been too reckless this time.But since it was already like this, regret was useless. Now he could only hope that the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s reputation would protect this secret.The entire crowd had turned silent after Wang Luyang\u2019s bid of five hundred million. Even Marquis Ying had become silent. Five hundred million was a price even he couldn\u2019t bear to waste.Now that the auction had reached this point, there was no need for Yao Niqian to fan the flames of people\u2019s passions. That would only cause people to feel disgusted.Seeing that no one else was bidding, Yao Niqian started to count down. In the end, Wang Luyang\u2019s high bid won the middle grade second tier Flesh Bone Restoration Pill.\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t be in a hurry to leave. The show has yet to end.\u201dSeeing that everyone was already preparing to get up, Yao Niqian smiled and received a jade case from another maid.Everyone\u2019s expressions became a bit strange. The auction this year truly was full of interesting surprises. What was this next treasure that was even more precious than that pill?Opening the jade case, Yao Niqian revealed a medicinal pill that stunned everyone.That was clearly the exact same pill as the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill from before! Didn\u2019t they say that it was one of a kind? Were they purposely playing with them?When Wang Luyang saw that pill, he immediately stood up. Everyone was expecting him to fly into a rage.But what no one expected was that he only foolishly looked at it for a moment before laughing. \u201cHaha, good, this time I didn\u2019t come for nothing.\u201dYao Niqian smiled and admiringly said, \u201cTruly worthy of being an alchemist grandmaster. You can tell from that far away. Yes, this is also a Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. However, this one is not middle grade. Instead, it is high grade!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cYes, this is a high grade ancient pill. The middle grade pill was only useful in the Blood Condensation realm and below. But this precious high grade pill is effective even for Tendon Transformation experts,\u201d Yao Niqian explained solemnly.A storm erupted in the crowd. Tendon Transformation experts? That was the peak of the Phoenix Cry Empire!\u201cHigh grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. Starting bid: two hundred million.\u201d\u201cFour hundred million!\u201dThe first person to shout was actually Wang Luyang. Moreover, he immediately raised the bidding price, clearly not wishing to take it slowly and displaying that his determination to obtain it.Everyone sighed at how rich alchemists were.\u201cFive hundred million!\u201dMarquis Ying bid shortly after Wang Luyang. Everyone anticipated seeing the competition between the two of them.\u201cBrother Chu Yang, do you think Marquis Ying can beat Wang Luyang?\u201d asked Xia Changfeng.\u201cThis time, the medicinal pill is a must-have for Marquis Ying. Even if he has to spend his entire fortune, he would still bid,\u201d sighed the crown prince.\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Xia Changfeng was a bit puzzled. It didn\u2019t seem that just a medicinal pill could be so coveted.\u201cBrother Xia must not know about this. A dozen years ago, Marquis Ying fought with an opponent, and in an effort to defeat him, he ended up losing a finger. Back then, he refused to seek treatment due to his pride. He wanted to use that event to motivate him to cultivate harder.\u201cSo from that point onwards, he started to train crazily, eventually breaking through and entering the Tendon Transformation realm. But after entering the Tendon Transformation realm, he realized that training in the Tendon Transformation realm required you to temper your tendons to connect them to your marrow. Having lost a finger, he was missing a tendon. Thus, it had an enormous impact on his cultivation.\u201cBut due to how long his finger had been severed, there was no way to fix it. He has spent several years roaming throughout empires without finding a way to heal it.\u201cThe reason he let Wang Luyang win last time was because that was just been a middle grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill. It was only useful to Blood Condensation cultivators. If he had used it, the chances of it helping him recover were extremely remote. Spending five hundred million on just a small chance really was a bit too much, thus he let it go.\u201cBut now this high grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill is practically godsend. So I can practically guarantee that he will obtain it. If that Wang Luyang refuses to give way, hehe\u2026\u201d Chu Yang coldly laughed and didn\u2019t continue.But it was extremely obvious that if Wang Luyang refused to be tactful, it would be exceedingly difficult for him to be able to leave the Phoenix Cry Empire.Even if he was the ruler of an empire, that empire wasn\u2019t comparable to the Phoenix Cry Empire. Marquis Ying wouldn\u2019t mind killing someone for his treasures.Xia Changfeng and Xia Baichi nodded. Alchemists were all exceedingly arrogant. Perhaps the competition between the two of them would extend past this auction.Wang Luyang\u2019s expression changed when he saw Marquis Ying bid against him so fiercely. He knew that Marquis Ying probably viewed this pill as a must-have. But getting him to give up instead was impossible.With a high grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill, his chances of figuring out the corresponding pill formula would skyrocket. And once he figured out the pill formula, his name would shake the heavens.Furthermore, alchemists did not lack money. Of course, that was excluding beginners who failed their refinements so much that they often bankrupted themselves.Just as Wang Luyang was about to bid again, Marquis Ying\u2019s soft voice rang out, \u201cGrandmaster Wang, this medicinal pill is of exceedingly great importance to me. Please yield to me. I can even give grandmaster several days to study it after I obtain it. Harming the relationship of our two empires for just a small medicinal pill really isn\u2019t wise.\u201dThis truly dazed the crowd. Marquis Ying was using both the carrot and the stick to force Wang Luyang to give up. It seemed this medicinal pill truly was exceptionally important to him.Yao Niqian\u2019s expression became a bit ugly though. This move was clearly disrupting the auction, but both Marquis Ying and Wang Luyang had high statuses and were their customers.If she were to reprimand these two, not only would it not change anything, but the chances of them continuing to compete were no longer great.Furthermore, punishing the two of them would definitely have a negative effect on the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s reputation. Yao Niqian began to hate that feminine voice of Marquis Ying\u2019s.\u201cMarquis Ying must be joking. This old man wants to compete, but unfortunately, I have no more money.\u201d Wang Luyang laughed lightly.The conclusion was a boring disappointment. Just what kind of person was Wang Luyang? No more money? This was clearly his way of giving the face to Marquis Ying and getting out of an awkward situation.Although Yao Niqian was extremely angered, her face still maintained that perfect smile of hers. Now that the auction was nearing its end, she didn\u2019t want to cause a huge fuss.\u201cMaster Marquis Ying bids five hundred million. Are there any higher bids?\u201d\u201cFive hundred million going once.\u201d\u201cFive hundred million going twice.\u201d\u201cFive hundred million going\u201cMarquis Ying had already relaxed inside his private room. Hearing the helplessness in Yao Niqian\u2019s voice, he coldly smiled. Indulging in this kind of feeling was his favorite.But a lazy voice caused his expression to immediately change. Even the tea in his hand spilled out.\u201cSix hundred million.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone turned their heads to look at the private room it had come from.When they saw it was Long Chen\u2019s private room, a strange expression appeared on several people.Back when Long Chen had been about to obtain the Starfusing Grass, Marquis Ying had purposely said some things that had incited Xia Baichi to fight with him over it. Now from Long Chen\u2019s words, it appeared he was looking for some revenge.Several people were praising Long Chen inside. There were few people in the entire Phoenix Cry Empire who would dare compete with Marquis Ying.Marquis Ying\u2019s face darkened. He hadn\u2019t expected that Long Chen who had been silent for so long would suddenly take this chance to look for trouble with him.\u201cSeven hundred million.\u201dBut at this point, he couldn\u2019t cower. That medicinal pill was something he absolutely had to obtain no matter the price.Otherwise, with his status, there was no way that he would have thickened his face to plead with Wang Luyang. This medicinal pill was just that important to him.A pleased smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face. Now he could take revenge on Marquis Ying for what he had done to him just before. He couldn\u2019t help but feel fresh and brighter inside.He had always been using divine sense to pay attention to Xia Changfeng\u2019s private room. Having learned from them that Marquis Ying treated this Flesh Bone Restoration Pill as a must-have, if he didn\u2019t go get some vengeance, then he wouldn\u2019t be Long Chen.Although he knew offending Marquis Ying was unwise, he didn\u2019t worry too much about that. First, he\u2019d relieve some of his anger.He didn\u2019t believe that Marquis Ying would actually go overboard against him for such a thing. With the alchemist guild behind him as a support, he had the confidence to provoke Marquis Ying.\u201cEight hundred million.\u201dThe Huayun Pavilion didn\u2019t send any warnings to him despite his high bids. Yao Niqian was actually excited inside; however, she hid her emotions extremely well.\u201cMaster Long Chen bids eight hundred million. Are there any higher bids? If not, then this high grade Flesh Bone Restoration Pill will be handed to him,\u201d announced Yao Niqian.\u201cWait a moment, I doubt that Long Chen actually has that much money. He\u2019s just making empty bids.\u201dMarquis Ying\u2019s feminine voice now held a trace of anger. Although he had suppressed it, people could still hear the fury in his voice.\u201cIs Marquis Ying questioning our integrity?\u201d Yao Niqian\u2019s smile immediately receded and she angrily said, \u201cYoung master Long Chen is grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s student. Everyone in the Phoenix Cry Empire knows this. Before the auction, grandmaster Yun Qi transferred all his credit to young master Long Chen. Does Marquis Ying still think that young master Long Chen is making empty bids?\u201dYao Niqian\u2019s words were rather blunt and impolite. Obviously, Marquis Ying had truly angered her by breaking the rules.Now that she had the opportunity, she would naturally relieve some of her anger. She was a woman, and a woman knew how to hold grudges. Once you angered a woman, they would no longer be soft and gentle anymore.Everyone gasped when they learned that grandmaster Yun Qi had transferred his credit to Long Chen.That meant Long Chen had the true support of the entire alchemist guild. That kind of guarantee meant Long Chen could buy anything he wanted. Who dared to say he had no money?But even Long Chen was dazed. How come he hadn\u2019t known about this? But he quickly realized that Marquis Ying\u2019s actions had angered the Huayun Pavilion. They were supporting him in order to give Marquis Ying a slap in the face.Marquis Ying\u2019s expression was extremely ugly now. If what Yao Niqian had said was true, then he really wouldn\u2019t be able to compete against Long Chen in terms of financial resources.\u201cOne billion.\u201dMarquis Ying pushed down his anger and raised the bid by a whole two hundred million. A billion gold coins! Just to buy a second tier medicinal pill! That was definitely unprecedented.With Marquis Ying\u2019s financial ability, a billion gold coins were already several years worth of savings.\u201cBrother Long, how about you don\u2019t bid again? It\u2019s already quite frightening.\u201d Shou Hou was quietly shivering.Back when Long Chen had bid, they had all been completely shocked. A simple opening of his mouth was equivalent to a hundred million gold\u2026 Even if it wasn\u2019t their money, it was still breathtaking.But Long Chen only smiled slightly. He was highly suspicious that Marquis Ying was the one who had stolen his cultivation ability. Now it was just him getting back some interest.\u201cOne billion five hundred million.\u201dImmediately after Shou Hou finished, Long Chen raised the bid, almost scaring Shou Hou to the point of fainting.Marquis Ying had just raised the price by two hundred million all at once. But now Long Chen was even more vicious, directly raising the price by half a billion! He was clearly using Yun Qi\u2019s money to suppress Marquis Ying.The crowd was completely silent. Even Wang Luyang was flabbergasted. That price had long since exceeded his expectations.Although he only had a middle grade Flesh Bone Recovery Pill and it was inferior to the high grade pill, there was still a large chance of him being able to figure out the pill formula from studying it. Therefore, he had also given up at this time.Crack. The teacup in Marquis Ying\u2019s hand was crushed, and even the tea that splashed onto his body was completely unnoticed by him.Blue veins were pulsing on his forehead. If he didn\u2019t know that the Huayun Pavilion had a powerful backer, he would have already charged out to go kill Long Chen.\u201cLong Chen, you want to obtain this pill that badly?\u201d Marquis Ying asked coldly.Long Chen laughed. He could tell that Marquis Ying had spat these words out through clenched teeth. In other words, he was exceptionally enraged, probably even more enraged than Long Chen had been when trying to obtain the Starfusing Grass.\u201cWell, actually this thing is pretty much useless to me,\u201d said Long Chen indifferently.\u201cThen, you\u2019re purposely making an enemy of me?\u201d Marquis Ying raged.\u201cYou can\u2019t put it that way. I have several reasons for wanting to obtain this thing. Reason number one is that it\u2019s an ancient pill. Even if I have to pay a high price for it, it\u2019s still worth it. If I bring it back to my teacher, he also wouldn\u2019t scold me. In fact, he might even praise me.\u201cReason number two is that you pissed me off just now. My temperament is a bit strange. I can take anything, but I can\u2019t take a loss like that.\u201cReason number three is that just like you, my father is also one of the three great pillars of this Phoenix Cry Empire. He spends his days guarding the barbarian border, fighting against enemies constantly, completing heroic contributions. But my family became penniless, unable to even keep a dozen servants.\u201cBut you, Marquis Ying, who is on the same level as my father, who lazes his days in the imperial palace, actually has this much money.\u201cSo I was curious just how big the difference between us was. Just how rich is senior Marquis Ying; just how many times more money does he have than my Long family?\u201d said Long Chen with a smile.The majority of the people present were members of the Phoenix Cry Empire. Although Long Chen had been laughing as he said those things, everyone could hear his resentment.\u201cSo you want to fight with me till the end?\u201d Marquis Ying asked lightly as he looked down at his broken teacup, killing intent surfacing in his eyes.\u201cNot really. Maybe if you increase the price again you\u2019ll win; or maybe if some people are able to tactfully display their own apologies, then my Long family will consider it and withdraw from this competition,\u201d said Long Chen.\u201cHahaha, fine, a tiger father truly has a tiger son. The younger generation truly does surpass the old one. I admit defeat today. Allow me to shamelessly make one last bid - one billion five hundred and one million,\u201d laughed Marquis Ying.Everyone was stupefied, never expecting that Long Chen would actually be able to force Marquis Ying to bow his head. Marquis Ying\u2019s admittance of defeat already said everything.Long Chen smiled slightly. It appeared he had already reached Marquis Ying\u2019s bottom line. His adding of a paltry one million obviously meant that if Long Chen were to make another bid, he would give up.But if he did give up, he would not hold back from taking extreme measures. Long Chen knew when to quit while he was ahead, and so he didn\u2019t increase the bid again.Today already counted as his victory. An expert on the same level as his father was pushed into defeat by him. Moreover, he had also managed to release some of his anger in this grand setting.But his actual strength still wasn\u2019t enough. He couldn\u2019t force Marquis Ying too far, otherwise, if Marquis Ying was truly angered, he would make him disappear without leaving behind a single trace. Even the alchemist guild wouldn\u2019t be able to investigate it.And even if they did investigate at that time, he would already be dead, so there was no point. Revenge had to be taken one step at a time.Yao Niqian had returned to her smiling self. Seeing that no one else was competing, she began to count down.Finally, Marquis Ying had his wish fulfilled and obtained the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill.Confetti suddenly started to rain down and music began to play. A dozen colorful young maidens danced gracefully.Yao Niqian gave a gracious thanks to everyone for participating. This time\u2019s Huayun Pavilion\u2019s auction had finally ended. The guests slowly started to leave.Long Chen wasn\u2019t in a rush. He waited until most of the crowd had left before exiting his private room.But as soon as he walked out, he ended up running into several people. Those people were precisely Xia Changfeng, Chu Yang, and Xia Baichi.\u201cLong Chen, don\u2019t think you can be arrogant just because of Yun Qi\u2019s support. The Empress Dowager has already decided to give the third princess to my brother. In the future, she will be brother\u2019s woman, so a lowly peasant like you should stop having any intentions about her,\u201d sneered Xia Baichi.\u201cOh, aren\u2019t you that woman who was sharing a bed with your master? Now that your master has left, don\u2019t you need to go attend to him?\u201d Before Long Chen even had a chance to say anything, Shou Hou had already retorted.Having muddled along with Long Chen for so long, he had become much more confident. He wouldn\u2019t be able to feel at peace without causing a bit of trouble.Xia Baichi\u2019s expression changed; Shou Hou\u2019s words were a vicious slap in the face for her.Back on that day, Xia Baichi had gone crazy and admitted to some scandalous affairs in front of many people. However, no one dared comment on it to her face. In the end, she had actually ended up fooling herself into thinking that they hadn\u2019t heard her due to how far the crowd had been.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it!\u201d Xia Baichi had just been about to charge over when Xia Changfeng pulled her back. After all, this was the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s territory, and fighting was prohibited.\u201cLong Chen, it is already set in stone that Chu Yao will be my woman. Don\u2019t have any fanciful thoughts. I am the Grand Xia\u2019s prince, while you are just a noble heir. Our statuses are far too different,\u201d said Xia Changfeng indifferently.Long Chen seemed to not even hear what he said. He knew that the reason they had come over was to provoke him.He had long since heard this news, so that provocation was unable to hurt him. Long Chen suddenly saw one of the guards behind the crown prince and said, \u201cI seem to have seen you before?\u201dThat guard smiled slightly. \u201cI am the crown prince\u2019s guard, so it\u2019s normal for you to have seen me.\u201d\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ve seen you in a very particular place. For example, near the martial arena.\u201d Long Chen looked closely at him.That guard didn\u2019t reply, merely looking back at Long Chen.Long Chen smiled slightly and said to Xia Changfeng, \u201cYour face is turning black; a great calamity is about to befall you. Try to be careful.\u201dAfter saying that, he brought his friends out of the Huayun Pavilion. But as soon as he left, Fu Gui ran up to him.\u201cThe boss wants to see you.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 Huayun SectPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeWithin a luxurious guest room inside the Huayun Pavilion, Long Chen was sitting with the charming Yao Niqian. He asked, \u201cYou\u2019re the big boss?\u201dShe laughed cutely and replied, \u201cAm I not a \u2018big\u2019 enough boss for you?\u201dAlong with her laugh, her chest jiggled. Long Chen had no choice but to admit she was definitely \u2018big\u2019 enough.But he wasn\u2019t a man who only wanted a chest. He preferred Meng Qi\u2019s tasteful aesthetic, or perhaps Chu Yao\u2019s grand well-bred poise.\u201cWhy did you want me to stay behind?\u201d Long Chen asked lightly.Seeing that Long Chen wasn\u2019t affected by her charm, Yao Niqian became a bit irritated. That was truly a blow; she was exceptionally confident in her seductiveness.But just as she was about to say something, another voice rang out.\u201cNiqian, don\u2019t make trouble.\u201dAnother woman walked over. She was around twenty years old. She looked to be exceptionally plain, yet she gave off a very posh feeling.\u201cHmph, what an insensitive guy. Big sis, I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019ll leave him to you.\u201d Yao Niqian didn\u2019t forget to give a glare to Long Chen before leaving the room.\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019d like to apologize for so boldly inviting you here. This little one is Bai Ling. Greetings young master Long Chen.\u201d That woman curtsied slightly.\u201cMiss is too polite.\u201d Long Chen also chose to bow slightly.\u201cI know that young master Long Chen\u2019s time is precious, so I\u2019ll keep this short. The first reason we invited you over was to discuss the splitting of the profits. The two medicinal pills sold for a total of two billion one million gold coins. This is a sky-high number.\u201d Bai Long couldn\u2019t help sighing emotionally.Although they had already had a high estimation of those two medicinal pill\u2019s prices, they had never expected for it to draw such turmoil.And Long Chen himself had also caused several of the auction prices to rise greatly. It could be said that he had been a huge contributor to their success this time.\u201cThis is your portion.\u201d Bai Ling handed him a crystal card.There were a billion gold coins on the card, causing Long Chen to become ecstatic. He would never have to worry about money again.Although he didn\u2019t know how the Huayun Pavilion had calculated it, he didn\u2019t really care about what was now chump change to him.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThe one who should be thanking the other is us. With your addition to the auction, the auction this time had the absolute greatest profit in all of history,\u201d laughed Bai Ling.Long Chen smiled, understanding that the main reason was because of him forcing Marquis Ying to pay more.\u201cNo, no, without the pavilion\u2019s support, I also wouldn\u2019t have been able to relieve that resentment.\u201dBai Ling was a bit startled. She laughed, \u201cI think young master Long Chen has misunderstood a bit. We didn\u2019t support you; grandmaster Yun Qi had told us to take care of you. Whatever you wanted to buy, no matter the price, he said he would pay for it.\u201d\u201cGrandmaster Yun Qi?\u201d Long Chen was extremely moved, never imagining that grandmaster Yun Qi had secretly helped him. He had obviously been closely paying attention to him.\u201cThis time we both benefited from helping each other. With young master Long Chen\u2019s help, our Huayun Pavilion has truly reaped an immense harvest this time. That is why to display our thanks, I will give you a gift.\u201dA book appeared in her hand. \u201cThis is a list of all the treasures in our storehouse. You can take one item.\u201dLong Chen was surprised, but he naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse such a good thing. Having helped the Huayun Pavilion earn so much money, it was simply right for him to be able to get a reward.Opening the book, he saw there really were quite a few good things. Although they had just completed their yearly auction, there were still countless treasures.Long Chen didn\u2019t even bother looking through the Battle Skills; there were no longer any Earth class ones left. They only had Mortal class ones, and he no longer needed any on that level.Armor and weapons also didn\u2019t suit him. But suddenly, his eyes brightened.\u201cOh, Heart-Rot Grass?\u201dThat was a poisonous grass. If refined into a poison, it would possess extremely acute toxicity.The poisonous extract that could be refined from the Heart-Rot Grass could be applied to arrowheads. Such an arrow would be able to kill even second rank Magical Beasts.\u201cI\u2019ll pick that.\u201d Long Chen pointed to the Heart-Rot Grass.When Bai Ling saw his selection, she couldn\u2019t help being a bit baffled. \u201cThis Heart-Rot Grass does have high toxicity, but it isn\u2019t very valuable. Does young master want to think it over some more?\u201dA stalk of Heart-Rot Grass was only worth a few hundred thousand gold coins. Bai Ling had been wanting him to select an extremely precious treasure. After all, Long Chen had helped their Huayun Pavilion make a great deal of profit; this was their way of winning favor with him.But he only picked a medicinal grass that was worth a few hundred thousand gold coins. Naturally, that was awkward for her.\u201cI\u2019m not that interested in the other things. This Heart-Rot Grass is perfect for me to study a bit,\u201d smiled Long Chen.\u201cHow about you also pick something else?\u201d probed Bai Ling.\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be too appropriate, would it?\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. In the Huayun Pavilion, whatever I say counts,\u201d said Bai Ling confidently.That was perfect for Long Chen, as he had actually been wondering what other bizarre things they possessed. When he had almost completely flipped through the book\u2019s contents, his heart suddenly jumped.\u201cNight Devil skull.\u201dAlthough his expression didn\u2019t change, his heart was already starting to pound. This was a true treasure!\u201cCan I pick this Night Devil skull?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cOf course.\u201d Bai Ling smiled. Although the Night Devil skull was worth over a million gold coins, it was not worth making a fuss over.In just a short time, people brought over the Heart-Rot Grass and the Night Devil skull.The Heart-Rot Grass was packed into a sealed foot-long bottle. Although it had been tightly sealed, an extremely acrid smell still came from it. The acrid smell seemed to want to bore through their noses and set their lungs on fire.A bright smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face when he saw that strand of Heart-Rot Grass. It had definitely matured properly and its toxicity was extremely high.As for the Night Devil skull, it was as tall as a human. It looked like an extremely frightening bat\u2019s head.He reached out his hand and placed the Heart-Rot Grass and Night Devil skull into his spatial ring before then thanking Bai Ling, \u201cMany thanks.\u201dBai Ling smiled slightly. \u201cYoung master Long Chen is too polite. As I said, the first reason we invited you here was to thank you. The other reason was to ask young master Long Chen if he wished to enter my Huayun Sect.\u201d\u201cHuayun Sect?\u201d Long Chen was startled.\u201cCorrect. The Huayun Pavilion is just one of my Huayun Sect\u2019s branch industries,\u201d laughed Bai Ling.\u201cDoes that mean young lady Bai is one of the sect\u2019s branch disciples?\u201d asked Long Chen.Bai Ling nodded. \u201cBai Ling isn\u2019t talented and is just an outer disciple of the Huayun Sect in charge of the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s Huayun Pavilion.\u201dLong Chen was startled. So this Bai Ling was actually the branch pavilion master and an outer disciple of the Huayun Sect.\u201cActually, with young master\u2019s talent and his attainments with medicinal pills, young master will quickly be able to walk out of these uncivilized, backward lands. This is my third year in the Phoenix Cry Empire. Now with young master Long Chen\u2019s assistance, I\u2019ve finally reached my target. Now when I return to the sect, I will be promoted to become an inner disciple.\u201d Anticipation appeared in her eyes. \u201cSo to repay this favor, I will shamelessly give you this invitation. If you enter my Huayun Sect, you will definitely have the best conditions to grow.\u201dLong Chen couldn\u2019t help being moved and asking, \u201cWhat do you mean, these uncivilized lands?\u201d\u201cHaha, young master must not know, but this world is so large it is out of your imagination. The Phoenix Cry Empire is just a drop of water in the ocean. This region is called uncivilized because it is far from the cultivation world. That was why I said that with your talent, you should go to a more expansive land to grow. Only then will you not be stifled,\u201d smiled Bai Ling.But when it came to explaining those more expansive lands, she didn\u2019t further say anything at all.This was the first time Long Chen had heard of the outer world. Grandmaster Yun Qi had barely raised that subject with him.And even Bai Ling didn\u2019t reveal too much. Although Long Chen was curious, he didn\u2019t keep questioning her.He laughed, \u201cMany thanks for your appreciation. If I ever do leave Phoenix Cry and want to see the outer world, then I will go looking for you.\u201dHis words were extremely tactful; he didn\u2019t agree nor decline.Bai Ling sighed, \u201cIt looks like you don\u2019t want to leave Phoenix Cry for now. But I will be returning to the sect immediately. How about this: If you do leave Phoenix Cry and don\u2019t find a suitable sect, keep my Huayun Sect in mind. Here, this is my symbol. With it, you can come to the Huayun sect to find me.\u201dReceiving a jade tablet from Bai Ling, Long Chen said, \u201cThen, I\u2019ll thank young miss for her help. To tell the truth, I really am interested in that vast and expansive sky that you were talking about.\u201dUnfortunately, he had too many troubles that he had to resolve. And there was no way Bai Ling could wait for him, as this was a crucial moment for her to promote from an outer disciple to an inner disciple.Although he didn\u2019t know exactly how different the two were, he could tell that it was extremely important to her since she couldn\u2019t conceal her excitement.As soon as Long Chen left, a side door opened and Yao Niqian walked in. She was confused and said, \u201cThis Long Chen actually refused sister\u2019s invitation.\u201d\u201cA refusal is normal. This Long Chen is definitely not as simple as you. He is extremely shrewd; he\u2019s definitely contemplating matters that he hasn\u2019t revealed,\u201d sighed Bai Ling.\u201cWhat a shame. If you could have lured him, a pill cultivator with endless prospects, into our Huayun Sect, then you might even be promoted to become a core disciple. How about I go try to charm him again? No harm right?\u201d said Yao Niqian.\u201cJust give it up. Long Chen isn\u2019t like those perverts you usually charm. You\u2019d just be disgracing yourself. We still have to finish some preparations. Once we\u2019re all set, we\u2019ll have to return to the sect. The Huayun Pavilion will be left to another disciple sent here to gain experience,\u201d said Bai Ling.Although it was hard for her to accept this, Yao Niqian always trusted what Bai Ling said. She only quietly cursed inside. Was this Long Chen even a man?\u201cAchoo!\u201dLong Chen had just entered his room when he sneezed.\u201cHmph, I don\u2019t know whether it is Marquis Ying or Xia Changfeng who is cursing me. Or is it that idiot woman?\u201d[1]Although he didn\u2019t know who was talking about him, that person definitely wasn\u2019t saying anything good about him.He called over Bao-er and repeatedly warned her not to let anyone interrupt him before tightly closing the door.\u201cIt should be time to refine the Starfusing Pill.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if his pill furnace was trying to seal a struggling Magical Beast.\u201cSEAL!\u201dLong Chen shouted and tightly pushed down the furnace lid. But a medicinal pill\u2019s essence couldn\u2019t be sealed just relying on physical strength.At the same time as his hand pushed down on the lid, his powerful Spiritual Strength surged out and completely locked down the pill furnace.This intense struggle continued for a full two hours before his pill furnace gradually returned to calm.Slowly opening the lid, the originally dark room immediately lit up. A pearl-like medicinal pill was emitting a gentle light.\u201cHehe, I finally succeeded.\u201dLong Chen relaxed and wiped away his sweat. He was incredibly exhausted and almost fainted.This was the third furnace of pills he had refined. The first furnace of pills had been to refine the Starfusing Pill Chu Yao needed. Of his three refinements, the Starfusing Pill had been the easiest to refine.Then, he had refined the Soul Devouring Heart Rotting Pill, a poison pill refined from the Heart-Rot Grass. It would be one of his protective measures in the future.The last thing he had refined just now was the hardest to refine, a soul nourishing pill. He had refined it by using the Night Devil skull he had obtained from the Huayun Pavilion.The Night Devil had a similar shape to a bat. An adult was a dozen meters long and fiercely bloodthirsty. Its most terrifying aspect was its ability to use spiritual attacks.To directly attack the spirit; that was a terrifying kind of method that was practically impossible to defend against.Long Chen had used the second rank Magical Beast Night Devil skull\u2019s crystal core as the main ingredient to refine a single soul nourishing pill.Soul nourishing pills were exceptionally special medicinal pills. They had practically vanished from this era. Even in his Long Chen\u2019s Pill God memories, there were only three formulas that could nourish the soul.Consuming it would benefit the spirit greatly, and at the initial stages of soul cultivation, consuming one soul nourishing pill was equivalent to having a huge head start over your competition.This was a rare medicinal pill that had absolutely no side effects. This pill was extremely precious to Long Chen in particular. As an alchemist, he definitely required a powerful Spiritual Strength.But the first thing that popped into his head when he looked at that pearl-like soul nourishing pill was a vision of Meng Qi\u2019s flawless face.Meng Qi was a Beast Tamer. That was true soul cultivator. It would be a waste for anyone else to take it.But Meng Qi was now in the Wind Spirit Pavilion. He didn\u2019t know where that was at the moment, so it would be impossible for him to send it to her.Sighing, he put away the soul nourishing pill. If he still didn\u2019t see Meng Qi again within half a year, then he would simply consume it himself.That was because this soul nourishing pill was not like other medicinal pills. If it wasn\u2019t consumed within half a year, the spiritual energy inside the pill would begin to fade.After putting away the medicinal pills, Long Chen could no longer support himself. Exhaustion caused him to collapse onto his bed. The next time he opened his eyes, it was already noon the next day.After washing up, he chatted with his mother, ate lunch, and left, ready to meet up with Chu Feng.He had already set up a meeting with Chu Feng for today at a teahouse. By the time Long Chen arrived, Chu Feng had already been waiting for a long time.Chu Feng had a middle-aged guard beside him. When he saw Long Chen approaching, that guard was just about to say something when his vision suddenly darkened and he fainted.After knocking him unconscious, Long Chen took out some Face Changing Liquid and applied it to his face. In just a couple of minutes, he had changed into the guard\u2019s clothes and left with Chu Feng to the imperial palace.Everything was going according to plan. Chu Feng had followed Long Chen\u2019s instructions to keep a guard beside him at almost all times. This was all in order to fool people for today\u2026Now Long Chen would no longer appear as conspicuous in other people\u2019s eyes. The two of them managed to easily enter into the inner section of the imperial palace.This was Long Chen\u2019s first time in the imperial palace. The winding palace maze completely confused him; without his powerful Spiritual Strength, he would have lost his direction.\u201cBrother Long, my big sis is under house arrest in her Jade Yao Palace. There are guards outside. They\u2019ve never blocked me from entering, but whether or not I can bring you in is still unknown.\u201d Chu Feng was hesitant.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, let\u2019s try our luck. Just follow the contingencies in our plan. If it really isn\u2019t going to work, then I won\u2019t force it,\u201d nodded Long Chen.Long Chen had come to deliver Chu Yao the medicinal pill, but he also wanted to help her resolve those foreign spiritual seeds.There was only one Starfusing Pill, and refining its medicinal pill\u2019s energy required skill. With Long Chen by her side, even if something unexpected happened, he might still be able to remedy the situation.But another reason he had come was because he missed her. Ever since he had revealed his feelings for her at the Lantern Festival, her beautiful image had always been held within his heart.He wanted her to have more faith in him. He wanted her to know that no matter how hard her days were, she would always have Long Chen with her. He wanted her to share a part of her pain with him. He wanted her to never have to suffer helplessly again.That was why he had come.Finally, they arrived at Chu Yao\u2019s Jade Yao Palace. There were eight guards wearing imperial robes guarding the gate.There were also dozens of other soldiers surrounding the perimeter. That truly angered Long Chen.This was the imperial palace, which was equivalent to Chu Yao\u2019s home. But it was completely surrounded by guards; how was this any different to being imprisoned? Long Chen was becoming increasingly disgusted with the royal family.\u201cThe Empress Dowager has ordered that outsiders cannot enter the Jade Yao Palace.\u201dAs expected, Chu Feng and Long Chen were blocked from entering.\u201cOutrageous! I\u2019m here to see my sister; why can\u2019t I enter?!\u201d Chu Feng shouted angrily.\u201cSeventh prince, I\u2019m sorry. You can enter, but your guard cannot.\u201d That guard was not overly servile or overbearing.\u201cHe is my personal guard! He\u2019s my most trusted guard, and if you won\u2019t believe me, then I\u2019ll make your head tumble to the floor!\u201d Chu Feng shouted sternly.That guard shook his head. His voice was as indifferent as ever as he replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; these are the Empress Dowager\u2019s orders. No one can change them.\u201dWhile Chu Feng and that guard were arguing, Long Chen had already spread out his divine sense. Sensing a figure sitting and leaning against a window, he couldn\u2019t help but feel pity.Chu Yao was as beautiful as ever; however, she had become much thinner and wan. It was obvious that this constant imprisonment over these days had made her suffer.Long Chen truly wished to punch that guard who was blocking them, but he didn\u2019t dare to. This was the imperial palace, and he didn\u2019t dare to be reckless here.\u201cWhat matter is causing this much ruckus?\u201dSuddenly, a displeased voice came from behind.\u201cGreetings, fourth prince.\u201dThat was the fourth prince Chu Xia. It seemed he had just happened to be passing by when he heard the commotion.Long Chen frowned slightly when he saw that it was the fourth prince. That was because he could see Chu Xia looking at him with a bit of surprise.Although he didn\u2019t know where he had messed up, he was now certain that Chu Xia had recognized him.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d After glancing at Long Chen for a moment, Chu Xia turned to the guards.\u201cReporting to fourth prince, seventh prince wanted to bring this guard into the Jade Yao Palace, but\u2026\u201d\u201cImpudent! You audacious slave, are you doubting my little brother? You actually think he\u2019d harm his own sister?\u201d The fourth prince interrupted angrily all of a sudden.\u201cThis little one doesn\u2019t dare.\u201d That guard jumped in fear. He hastily kneeled down. Obviously, the fourth prince instilled much more fear in him than the seventh prince.\u201cLet them in,\u201d ordered the fourth prince coldly.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d That guard was still hesitant.\u201cIf the Empress Dowager wants to assign blame, naturally it will fall on me. Could it be that you don\u2019t even trust me?\u201d The fourth prince asked coldly.\u201cThis little one doesn\u2019t dare.\u201d That guard fell back and no longer said anything.\u201cEnter then.\u201d The fourth prince patted Chu Feng on the shoulder, but he was clearly looking at Long Chen.Long Chen nodded. Although he didn\u2019t know why the fourth prince would help him, now wasn\u2019t the time to think about that.After the seventh prince and Long Chen entered the Jade Yao Palace, the fourth prince smiled and also left.Entering the Jade Yao Palace, the two of them went into the central courtyard. Chu Yao had been leaning against the window and looking down at the fish swimming in the pond when she turned slightly and suddenly saw them.When she saw Long Chen, first she was dazed for a moment before wild joy filled her. Her jade hand lightly covered her cherry lips, and her tears began to wildly fall.She had somehow managed to recognize Long Chen. Long Chen slowly walked up to her and apologized, \u201cSorry for being so late.\u201dChu Yao couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. With her head in Long Chen\u2019s chest, she began to truly weep, seeming to want to cry out all her grief.During this time, she had been under constant house arrest. When she heard that the Empress Dowager had already decided to marry her off to Xia Changfeng, she had almost collapsed.If Chu Feng hadn\u2019t secretly brought Long Chen\u2019s promise to her, she might have already become hopeless and left this colorless world.Every day she would watch the sun rise and bitterly wait for Long Chen. Each day had felt longer than a year to her. That kind of suffering was something only she knew about.Long Chen enjoyed her fragrance as he gently stroked her long hair, letting her give vent to her grief.At the same time, he also swore to himself that no matter the price, he would definitely protect Chu Yao. Even if that price was his life.Sometimes, he would feel that Chu Yao was even more pitiful than himself. After all, Long Chen at least had a mother and father who loved him. But Chu Yao had lived her whole life in the loveless imperial palace. The imperial palace was a place where there was no trust or love. For a weak woman like her, it really was too painful.After feeling enough time had passed, Long Chen noticed that Chu Feng was just awkwardly standing in his original location, not knowing whether he should stay or leave.\u201cCough.\u201d Long Chen lightly coughed, and Chu Yao broke out of her daze and hastily escaped from Long Chen\u2019s embrace. Her entire face was red, and she couldn\u2019t even bring herself to look at either of them.\u201cUh, how about I go for now?\u201d Chu Feng asked probingly.\u201cNo need. Just help to keep watch for me. I have some secret matters I have to do with your sister.\u201d Long Chen waved his hand.But as soon as he saw Chu Feng\u2019s shocked expression, he knew that the kid had misunderstood and hastily added, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201dHe didn\u2019t explain further. Not explaining was better, as the explanation was even more explicit. Chu Yao\u2019s pretty face was completely red, and she was too embarrassed to even show her face.Long Chen straightforwardly pulled Chu Yao upstairs, leaving behind a stupefied Chu Feng who just stood there alone and in a daze.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was large with three floors, the third floor being her personal chambers.Long Chen had never once gone into a woman\u2019s chambers before. What surprised Long Chen was that Chu Yao\u2019s room didn\u2019t have any majestic or grand decorations. Instead, everything was very simple and plain.\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange?\u201d Chu Yao pulled Long Chen in and quietly said, \u201cI\u2019ve always imagined that if only I had been born into a normal family, I would be free. I might not be able to have the luxury or a high status, but at least I would have my freedom.\u201dLong Chen smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s just because of your viewpoint. To be born into poverty is to have to struggle every day. In this world, if you want to be free, then you have to have a matching power.\u201dChu Yao nodded and led Long Chen into her room. Long Chen was startled to see that her bed was covered with drawings of himself.Those drawings weren\u2019t made by a master painter. Instead, they were remarkably lifelike, without the embellishment of the drawings of him on the market.\u201cYou drew these?\u201d Long Chen asked in surprise.Her face reddened a bit and she nodded. \u201cEver since the Lantern Festival, drawing images of you is the only way I can pass the time. Otherwise, the days are even more unbearable.\u201dLong Chen felt a sudden burst of emotion for her. Looking at how much thinner and wan she was, he felt his heart ache. \u201cChu Yao.\u201dWrappings his arms around her tender waist, he pulled her into a tight kiss.Chu Yao immediately felt the sky and earth spinning around her. Long Chen\u2019s masculine scent filled her nose, and it was like sparks were running throughout her body. Tightly hugging onto Long Chen\u2019s back, the two of them lost themselves in that intoxicating feeling.\u201cLong Chen, Yao-er wants to be your woman.\u201d Her breathing was shallow and her beautiful eyes were blurry as she looked at Long Chen. The intense feelings she had for him were enough to melt the steel.With a beauty in his arms, Long Chen felt as if his whole body was about to ignite. Even his breathing was becoming hurried.With her encouraging him, Long Chen\u2019s most primal desires ignited and his hands slowly started roving up from her waist.\u201cLong Chen, I want to be your woman. Even if I die, Yao-er will be content.\u201d Her entire body turned soft as she quietly whispered.Chu Yao\u2019s voice was soft, but to Long Chen, the words were like thunder. His originally aroused desire was immediately extinguished like icy water had been thrown over him.When Chu Yao sensed Long Chen\u2019s body suddenly stiffen, she slowly opened her eyes and saw that his expression was a bit unnatural. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dHe took a deep breath and told himself to stay calm. After gently planting a kiss on her forehead, he said, \u201cYao-er, do you not have faith in me?\u201dFrom her tone and what she said, Long Chen had understood her inner thoughts. She was planning on ending her life after giving herself to him.And also for some unknown reason, Long Chen had a sudden premonition that if he did go through with that, he would regret it for the rest of his life.Although such a premonition was extremely abstruse, Long Chen had always had a keen intuition ever since merging with a Pill God\u2019s soul. His gut had never misled him.\u201cLong Chen\u2026\u201dChu Yao looked at Long Chen and suddenly started sobbing into his chest. \u201cI love you, Long Chen. I would rather die than marry someone else.\u201dLong Chen gently stroked her back. As expected, his intuition had been correct. After patting her, he said, \u201cYao-er, did you forget the promise we made to each other at the lantern festival?\u201d\u201cThe Dragon swims across the four oceans; the Phoenix flies throughout the nine lands,\u201d she softly recited. But as soon as she finished, her tears truly began to fall.\u201cSeas of blood may block us, but we will never give up our path; Dragon and Phoenix will both live to old age!\u201d Long Chen also heavily recited what he had said in return. That was his first promise to Chu Yao.Chu Yao\u2019s jade hands tenderly stroked Long Chen\u2019s cheeks. She was choked with emotion as she sobbed, \u201cBut\u2026 can we really live to old age?\u201d\u201cWe definitely will. Believe in me.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll trust in my future husband.\u201d Chu Yao smiled, appearing like a dew-dropped flower with her tears on her beautiful face.\u201cYao-er, you really are beautiful,\u201d blurted out Long Chen.\u201cAs long as you like how I look then I\u2019ll let you see me every day.\u201d This time Chu Yao wasn\u2019t shy anymore.\u201cHaha, good, we\u2019ll have many more days for that. But today I came mostly to bring you this.\u201dLong Chen took out the Starfusing Pill, immediately causing the light in the room to turn gentle. Although it was the middle of the day, that was not able to conceal the light coming from the pill.\u201cHere, consume it. I\u2019ll protect you.\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t know what it was, due to her trust in Long Chen, Chu Yao obediently swallowed that Starfusing Pill.With Chu Yao sitting lotus style on the bed, Long Chen placed his hand on the middle of her back, using his Spiritual Strength to keep a close eye on the state of her body.That Starfusing Pill was something Long Chen had used his full effort to refine. It was the best pill he had refined up to this point, and it could already count as a peak existence amongst second tier medicinal pills in Phoenix Cry.In just several breaths\u2019 time, the medicinal pill dissolved and spread quickly throughout her body.\u201cDon\u2019t bother with it. Let the energy flow as it wishes.\u201dThe Starfusing Pill spread throughout and filled every single path of Chu Yao\u2019s meridians. Some of her meridians, which hadn\u2019t been opened up yet, were slowly forced open by its energy.But such a feeling was not a pleasant one. It felt as if millions of ants were crawling throughout her meridians, causing her to feel an irritating itch.Chu Yao knew that this was something Long Chen had refined for her, so she did her absolute best to hold back any pained sounds, not wanting to worry him.This kind of suffering was something Long Chen was extremely familiar with. Back when he had first absorbed heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual energy into his body to open his meridians, he had felt such an intense pain that he would never be able to forget it in this lifetime.Although Chu Yao was much better off than he had been at that time, one was pain while the other was itchiness. The degree of difficulty in bearing with it was essentially equal.It took a full two hours for the Starfusing Pill\u2019s medicinal energy to completely merge into Chu Yao\u2019s meridians.\u201cNow draw the medicinal energy into your Dantian. You have to pull that energy from the farthest parts first, just like how rivers flow into the ocean.\u201dChu Yao nodded and slowly began to circulate her spiritual qi. She began to collect the medicinal energy from her meridians into her Dantian.What surprised Long Chen was Chu Yao\u2019s control of her spiritual qi which was extremely precise, to the point where she could control the slightest detail.Chu Yao was definitely a martial genius. Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but sigh emotionally. Just by using her familiarity with her spiritual qi, she was already able to reach such a high level of control.If those nine foreign spiritual qis weren\u2019t blocking her Dantian and causing her spiritual qi to be too chaotic and weak, the result from their fight on Sunset Mountain would probably have been reversed.\u201cGood, now increase the speed. The faster, the better. Channel your energy,\u201d directed Long Chen quietly.With the pulling of the medicinal energy in her body, Chu Yao gradually caused the small streams of energy to become large rivers, the energy becoming greater and greater.Following Long Chen\u2019s directions, she increased her speed and now her meridians were pushed to their max, sending the energy to her Dantian wildly like surging waves.BOOM!Chu Yao\u2019s Dantian shook and the nine foreign spiritual energy seeds locking it were immediately pushed to the breaking point by those huge waves.\u201cNo, you\u2019re still lacking some energy!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s expression changed slightly. His Spiritual Strength rushed out, aiding Chu Yao in pulling the Starfusing Pill\u2019s energy to her Dantian. Those waves now became a flood.If it had been just the medicinal energy, then it would count as a flood; but then adding in Long Chen\u2019s Spiritual Strength, that flood became a huge torrent.Those nine foreign spiritual qis that had been nourished by Chu Yao for so many years were immediately crushed into pieces and merged into her Dantian.BOOM!Following the breaking of those nine spiritual seeds, Chu Yao\u2019s Dantian immediately became filled with endless energy. It caused Chu Yao who was originally at the ninth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation to immediately break through to the Blood Condensation realm.\u201cFirst Heavenstage of Blood Condensation!\u201d\u201cSecond Heavenstage!\u201d\u201cThird Heavenstage!\u201d\u2026Her cultivation base rapidly advanced at a shocking pace.Those nine spiritual seeds had been nourished for so many years. Now that they were crushed, the amount of energy they released was absolutely astonishing.It could also be seen just how terrifying Chu Yao\u2019s talent was. Despite not spending much time on cultivating, just the accumulated energy she had gained passively was enough to even scare Long Chen.\u201cFifth Heavenstage!\u201d\u201cSixth Heavenstage!\u201dNow Long Chen was truly stupefied. Chu Yao\u2019s talent was so great that Huang Chang would have been nothing in front of her.\u201cSeventh Heavenstage!\u201d\u201cEighth Heavenstage!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s expression changed. He realized that under Chu Yao\u2019s rapid advances in her cultivation base, it seemed she was going to break out of the Blood Condensation realm to reach a higher level.BOOM!As he predicted, Chu Yao\u2019s cultivation base advanced to the ninth Heavenstage, and there was still an enormous amount of energy remaining.\u201cCrap!\u201dLong Chen shouted and immediately activated his FengFu Star. He poured extremely pure spiritual qi into Chu Yao\u2019s body and tightly sealed her Dantian.He spat out a mouthful of blood. In order to avoid hurting Chu Yao, that spiritual qi he had poured into her body was not capable of defending itself from that wild, out of control spiritual qi in her body, causing him to suffer a loss.\u201cLong Chen!\u201d Chu Yao let out an alarmed cry. At this point, she had already lost control of her own cultivation base!\u201cNot a problem! Just calm yourself. I\u2019ll help you control your Dantian\u2019s energy. You absolutely can\u2019t break through again; otherwise, your foundation will be practically ruined.\u201d Long Chen explained while suppressing her Dantian.Chu Yao hastily stabilized her state of mind. Working with Long Chen, they tried to control the energy in her Dantian that seemed almost endless.Luckily, Chu Yao\u2019s control of that energy was extremely great. Knowing that this was a crucial moment, she focused completely on controlling her Dantian.Two hours later, her Dantian finally stabilized. Chu Yao collapsed onto her bed. The amount of mental energy she had used up just now had been too great.Long Chen wasn\u2019t much better off than her. Without his powerful Spiritual Strength, he would have already fainted. The feeling of having to take hits without hitting back truly was a bit irritating.He covered Chu Yao with her blanket and left a piece of paper behind that told her to properly rest and to let him handle everything else.Chu Feng had been waiting for six hours. Only now did he see an exhausted Long Chen walk down, and for a moment, he didn\u2019t know what to say.Long Chen didn\u2019t even have the strength to explain. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019m tired.\u201dBut after the two of them exited Jade Yao Palace, they hadn\u2019t walked far before they were stopped by someone.\u201cThe fourth prince wishes to see you.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He smiled lightly. \u201cBrother Long truly is a dragon amongst men. No matter what, such boldness truly is worth admiring.\u201d\u201cFourth prince flatters me. But this little brother still doesn\u2019t know just how you recognized me,\u201d replied Long Chen.He really did want to know just what he had forgotten about. He was confident that his appearance changing technique did not have the slightest flaw.\u201cEven a wise man who thinks it over a thousand times will forget at least one thing. To be honest, I didn\u2019t actually recognize you at first, and it was only when I saw that ring on your hand that I managed to figure out something was strange. Then, adding on your gaze, I realized it was you.\u201d The fourth prince pointed to Long Chen\u2019s hand.Only then did Long Chen suddenly realize that he was wearing his spatial ring on his finger. That ring had a design that was specific to the alchemist guild. He had actually forgotten such a large detail.\u201cThe fourth prince truly is someone observant to the smallest detail. It really is worthy of admiration. But what I really want to know is, why did you help me?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cHaha, you might not believe me even if I tell you. The truth is, I dislike Xia Changfeng intensely. No matter what, Chu Yao is still my sister. Although familial affection is a luxury that can\u2019t be afforded in the imperial palace, I still have some in my heart.\u201cI do not have the heart to force Chu Yao to marry someone she doesn\u2019t like. But you also know that the imperial palace is simply like that. All that matters is if it will benefit the empire; no one cares about your emotions. That is simply the helpless truth of living in the imperial palace.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to persuade the Empress Dowager many times in hopes of changing her mind, but none of it had any effect. In the end, I actually ended up infuriating her and being kicked out of her Empress Dowager Hall.\u201cFrom the fact that brother Long come to visit Chu Yao today, I can tell that you have truly sincere feelings for Chu Yao. But my ability is limited, and I can only help you this much,\u201d sighed the fourth prince.\u201cFourth prince is too polite. Long Chen will remember this matter.\u201d It seemed he would have to owe a favor to the fourth prince for today.\u201cAs for the matter of your Long family losing its stipend, I once tried investigating. But I was shut down before I could get to the bottom of it. So, I\u2019m also powerless when it comes to your Long family.\u201dLong Chen frowned and asked, \u201cCan fourth prince tell me what he discovered?\u201d\u201cAh well, it was something that happened in the imperial palace, so it\u2019s extremely muddied. My brothers and I also fight and scheme against each other. I really am powerless when it comes to it.\u201d The fourth prince shook his head.Long Chen\u2019s eyes brightened ever so slightly. Although the fourth prince didn\u2019t give him a direct response, the fact that he had purposely mentioned his brothers was definitely somewhat interesting.There were a total of seven princes. Other than the fourth prince, there were six left. Of those remaining six, the seventh prince could also be excluded.Then, that left the crown, second, third, fifth, and sixth princes. Long Chen had observed each of them carefully at the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival. Other than the crown prince, none of the others seemed to be shrewd enough.Then, the most suspicious one would have to be the crown prince. Moreover, Long Chen had recognized the assassin who had killed Li Hao as one of his henchmen. All the evidence pointed to him.\u201cMany thanks.\u201d Long Chen cupped his hands.\u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t accept your thanks,\u201d laughed the fourth prince. He then sighed, \u201cSometimes I truly envy you noble heirs. You can be free and unconstrained, not like us who do not have freedom. I even have to suck up to people I plainly dislike. Speaking of which, Xia Changfeng is returning to the Grand Xia in ten days to prepare for his wedding with Chu Yao. Although I truly wish to punch him in the face, I can only give him a smile. That\u2019s the sorrow of living in the imperial palace.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s leaving in just ten days?\u201d Long Chen didn\u2019t bat an eye, but a cold light flashed in his eyes.The fourth prince seemed to not notice any change in Long Chen\u2019s expression. Sipping some tea, he replied, \u201cYes, he\u2019s taking the southern pass, a shortcut to the Grand Xia. A prince\u2019s wedding naturally requires many preparations.\u201dLong Chen nodded and kept that information in mind. At the same time, an outrageous idea popped into his head. If he could pull off that plan, this matter with Chu Yao would be easily resolved\u2026The fourth prince chatted for a bit longer with Long Chen before politely seeing him off. When he once more returned to his room, a woman appeared.That woman seemed to be in her thirties. She was tall and veiled in extravagance, giving off a cold sensation that she could not be offended.\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing right now is extremely dangerous,\u201d she said.The fourth prince smiled slightly and sipped some tea. \u201cDanger means risk, and risk means there\u2019s a chance of a high payout. I feel that it\u2019s worth it. If Long Chen loses, then he will just be another corpse, meaningless to us. But if he succeeds, then the plan will advance a couple of steps. Mom, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dThat woman was precisely Phoenix Cry\u2019s Queen Mother of the Western Palace. She shook her head and said, \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing. I had a mission in being married off to here. You and I have to remember that.\u201d\u201cHmph, you were originally a princess from the Grand Xia, but you came here to Phoenix Cry for your own goals. As for me? Was I born to be just a chess piece? They plan on seizing Phoenix Cry\u2019s lands, making Xia Changfeng the ruler of this empire. Then, he\u2019ll monopolize all the rich lands. When the time comes for credit, it\u2019ll all be theirs. As for us mother and son, are we destined to become their tools? Why?\u201dThe fourth prince suddenly let out all his anger into a loud bellow. The current him was just like a beast that had been provoked, capable of devouring anyone at any moment.\u201cXia-er, I know you\u2019re mad inside. With your talent, you wouldn\u2019t lose out to anyone. But this is fate.\u201d\u201cFate? Fate is dictated by man. I will control my own fate. I will not be a puppet! I will become the Emperor!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it; I\u2019ve already made all my plans. Right, how is the Empress Dowager?\u201d asked the fourth prince.\u201cShe\u2019s under my Soul Assimilation Art. I can basically completely control her. But as a precaution, I always add a bit more \u2018control\u2019,\u201d she replied indifferently.\u201cOkay, good. Now we just have to wait for good news from Long Chen. I hope he doesn\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d The fourth prince smiled. Raising his cup, he drained it in a single gulp.\u2026When Long Chen returned home, he saw there were a couple of carriages by the gate. As soon as he walked past the gates, the housekeeper immediately informed him that there were guests present.Long Chen was startled, as it had been many years since someone had paid a visit to their Long family. Why were there guests now?He went straight to his mother. He could already see that she was talking with a couple of smiling guests. Seeing Long Chen come over, she hastily said, \u201cChen-er, come. Greet your two aunts.\u201dAmongst the group, two of them were old wives who were similar in age to his mother. Long Chen had no alternative but to greet them as maternal aunts.\u201cHaha, what a good child. He\u2019s grown up in an instant. Quick, you guys. Come greet your cousin.\u201d One of them hastily called out to the few people behind her.There were three men and two women, all around the same age as Long Chen. One of the men awkwardly said, \u201cCousin, it\u2019s been many years.\u201dLong Chen nodded. He still vaguely remembered this person. Back when they were little, this person had forcefully snatched his toys, causing him to cry.Although he felt that it was a bit abrupt to suddenly meet his mother\u2019s family, seeing how happy she was, Long Chen also felt it would be bad to say anything about it, so he merely forced out a few courteous sentences.As soon as that was done, Long Chen stood up and said his goodbyes. Only then did Long Chen learn from his mother that they had come to apologize to her.\u201cChen-er, I also have a bit of grudge against them for not helping us back when we first entered a crisis. However, now they came and told me the whole story. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t want to help, but that they didn\u2019t dare to,\u201d sighed Mrs. Long.\u201cThat crisis has already passed and you\u2019ve also become a high status alchemist. Our Long family has also risen from that. Mom has also thought about it and accepted it. Let the past stay in the past. I hope you also won\u2019t hold it against them. After all, they are your mom\u2019s family.\u201dLong Chen coldly sneered inside; they hadn\u2019t dared to help? What had they been doing when the Long family had almost gotten to the point where they hadn\u2019t been able to afford food?Even if they didn\u2019t dare help obviously, secretly sending a bit of money to help was still something incredibly easy.The current Long Chen was now a towering figure that no one in the capital didn\u2019t know of. He had a close relationship with grandmaster Yun Qi and even dared to compete with Marquis Ying at the auction. That was enough to display how domineering he was.Long Chen had used that kind of method to tell everyone that his Long family was no longer the same Long family as before. He was not someone that could be bullied by just anyone.The fact that they had only come now to apologize was clearly just them trying to curry favor. Long Chen truly held them in contempt, but since his mother had already forgiven them, he could not argue too much about it.If his mother wanted to, then she could do whatever she wanted. Living in the secular world meant you had to endure living as how society expected you to.Seeing that Long Chen didn\u2019t have that much of a bad reaction to her family, Mrs. Long also became more at ease. After all, no matter how much of a grudge she had, they were her family. And having been alone for so many years, she also thirsted for familial love.Long Chen accompanied his mother for a while. She asked him a couple of simple questions about his current situation, and he replied with a few vague sentences. Even if he was just doing the same thing as he always did, telling her the good news but not the bad, it still let her feel a bit relieved.After that, Long Chen went into seclusion. Having been busy all this time dealing with Chu Yao\u2019s matter, he hadn\u2019t truly had time to focus on cultivation.Right now, he had an idea to make sure Xia Changfeng remained forever in the Phoenix Cry Empire, but Xia Changfeng always had many guards around him. He had to be absolutely sure to completely eliminate that bastard in just one attempt.But ever since condensing the eleventh cyclone, he had become completely bewildered about how he was supposed to cultivate further. He had no idea just how to use the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art to break through to the Blood Condensation realm.But there was no other way for him to get stronger\u2026 He had no real Dantian without the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, so only by further training in it could he advance.\u201cYoung master, someone\u2019s looking for you.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt as if he were dreaming.That woman was precisely the maiden who had protected him from crap-brother Xi when he had attacked him on Sunset Mountain.\u201cNo, no. I still haven\u2019t thanked elder sister for your help back then,\u201d said Long Chen hastily.\u201cDon\u2019t call me elder sister; it sounds weird. I\u2019m sister Meng Qi\u2019s junior apprentice-sister. My name is Lu Fang-er, so you can call me sister Fang-er,\u201d she laughed.\u201cHaha, then little brother Long Chen greets sister Fang-er,\u201d laughed Long Chen. He had a kind of friendly feeling towards this Lu Fang-er.Seeing her made him feel that the distance between and Meng Qi was no longer as distant as before. He also had a way to pass on the soul nourishing pill.\u201cHaha, your mouth really is skillful. No wonder you\u2019ve become the idol in the hearts of all the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s maidens.\u201d Lu Fang-er held out a drawing of him and laughed.Looking at that drawing, Long Chen immediately felt embarrassed. That was the cover of the comic depiction of his battle with Huang Chang, the Phoenix Cry Divine Battle.\u201cCough, that was just a joke some merchants made.\u201d\u201cYou confessed your emotions to a princess and then used your strength to defeat a powerful opponent; that was a joke?\u201d Lu Fang-er teased.Long Chen immediately felt his heart drop. If that matter was heard by Meng Qi then\u2026\u201cLong Chen, this isn\u2019t acceptable. My big sis is a fairy in human form. For her to have a favorable impression of you, do you not know how to treasure that?\u201d Lu Fang-er was dissatisfied. \u201cSince we know each other a bit, I\u2019ll give you some advice. Immediately break things off with that princess and I won\u2019t have to tell my big sis about it.\u201dHis expression immediately changed when he heard this. Thinking about the warmth and tenderness Chu Yao currently felt for him, he shook his head and sighed, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t do that.\u201dAs he said that he felt as if needles were stabbing into his heart. That decision was extremely difficult to make.Meng Qi\u2019s beauty and kindness had been deeply imprinted into his heart. She had given him his first taste of love.As for Chu Yao, she would sacrifice her everything for him. Asking him to leave Chu Yao at this time was absolutely impossible for him.\u201cHow can you be so stubborn? You aren\u2019t even satisfied with just my big sis; you actually have to play around with the women here too. If you choose her, then don\u2019t ever think about seeing my sister again,\u201d warned Lu Fang-er angrily.Long Chen took a deep breath. In the face of his complicated feelings, he was completely helpless. He refused to give on either of them. But now he had to choose which one.Seeing that Long Chen remained silent, Lu Fang-er continued, \u201cAre you really going to give on my sister for some princess?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not giving up. I cannot give up on either one.\u201d Long Chen shook his head.\u201cHa, your face really is thick. You actually want to monopolize two beauties for yourself.\u201d The angry Lu Fang-er actually laughed when she saw Long Chen act so confidently and shameless.Long Chen was startled at that. He didn\u2019t quite understand just what Lu Fang-er was saying.\u201cAh, whatever. This is how a true man should act. If you really did give up that pitiful princess just to appease me, then you really would have had to say goodbye forever to my sister,\u201d laughed Lu Fang-er. \u201cHow could a man who is fickle in love possibly enter my sister\u2019s eyes? That was just a small test just now. I suppose you\u2019ve just managed to pass.\u201dA bead of sweat silently rolled off Long Chen\u2019s forehead. A feeling of exhaustion rolled over him. He would rather have a huge battle with someone then endure such a test again.\u201cHowever, you\u2019re also celebrating too early. That test was just one I did from a personal point of view. As for my big sister, whether she will let you have another beauty along with her is something only she knows,\u201d Lu Fang-er laughingly warned him when she saw him relax.His nerves which had only just relaxed immediately tightened again. Lu Fang-er continued, \u201cBut from what I understand about my sister, you should have the greatest chance out of all men. And with me helping you, your chances should increase even more.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll thank sister Fang-er for the help,\u201d said Long Chen hastily.\u201cHaha, I won\u2019t disturb you anymore. I had business to do in coming here. After flying for seven days and nights, I\u2019m already completely exhausted. Plus, you don\u2019t even pour me a cup of tea,\u201d sighed Lu Fang-er discontentedly.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll immediately pour some tea for sister Fang-er.\u201d Long Chen quickly and carefully poured a cup of tea for her. There was no way around it. He definitely had to give her a good impression for the sake of Meng Qi.Lu Fang-er took the teacup with a somewhat strange expression. \u201cDoes your Long family normally like to use cold water for tea?\u201dOnly then did Long Chen realize that the pot was already completely cold. But he thickened his face and said, \u201cThis is cold tea that\u2019s supposed to be drunk cold. Sister Fang-er can try it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be strange if anyone believed you,\u201d scolded Fang-er.\u201cIf sister Fang-er doesn\u2019t want to drink cold tea, then I\u2019ll immediately steep some hot tea for you.\u201d\u201cAh, forget about it. As long as you have the right heart, then it\u2019s fine. Coming and going like this is actually quite annoying, but if I didn\u2019t, then I\u2019d feel too sorry for you.\u201dFor a moment, Long Chen didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. This Fang-er truly was mischievous. But she still gave off a very innocent and lively feeling. She said whatever she wanted to. It really was easy for people to feel friendly to her.The Wind Spirit Pavilion was many thousands of miles away from this place. Even if she was riding a Magical Beast, traveling for seven full days and nights was still extremely exhausting. So he could understand her teasing of him.\u201cNext, I\u2019ll tell you some good news. My sister gave me a gift for you.\u201d Lu Fang-er pointed to a small trunk to the side.Only then did Long Chen realize there was a two feet tall rectangular trunk.When the trunk was gently opened, Long Chen was astonished to see that there was a small furred creature inside.It was a small wolf cub only the size of a palm. Its body was completely snow white. Only a small section of fur at the middle of its forehead was a fiery red color. It was extremely adorable.This small cub had yet to even open its eyes after being born. It was blindly searching around, appearing to look for food.\u201cScarlet Flame Snow Wolf?\u201dLong Chen was extremely startled. This was the cub of a Magical Beast that he had read about before.The Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf - its body was completely snow white with only a small lock of fur that was a blazing red color. It was extremely easy to recognize.But most Scarlet Flame Snow Wolves weren\u2019t of a completely pure bloodline. Their fur would be of a duller color and would even have some spots sometimes.But this Snow Wolf cub didn\u2019t have a single spot. That meant it was an extremely pure-blooded Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf.Such a Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf that was completely pure would grow to become an overlord third rank Magical Beast when matured, and it could even contend against fourth rank Magical Beasts. That was an existence that surpassed the Tendon Transformation realm.\u201cCorrect, this is a pure-blooded Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf that has just been born. It was given to my sister as a gift from her master, but she instead wanted me to fly through the night to give it to you.\u201d Lu Fang-er looked at Long Chen with a complicated expression.His heart shook. Not only had Meng Qi not forgotten about him, but she actually worried about him. Such pure feelings from a beauty caused Long Chen to feel an urge to tear up.\u201cOriginally, sister wanted it to be a weak housepet for you, but she definitely never thought that you\u2019d have already become a Pill Adept. Your Spiritual Strength isn\u2019t low, so I can impart a couple of techniques to control beasts to you. Then, this Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf can become a battling housepet,\u201d said Lu Fang-er.Ordinary martial artists would always have Beast Tamers use their martial force or other techniques to gradually tame the Magical Beast, letting it become a housepet.But such a housepet wasn\u2019t perfect. After all, Magical Beasts had a violent and brutal aura that could not be removed. A housepet devouring their master was a common occurrence.But even so, Magical Beast housepets were still extremely precious. Although it was a bit dangerous, once it was properly trained and if it was used properly, a Magical Beast was definitely an extremely terrifying addition to your combat strength.What was special about a battle housepet was that it could be controlled much better. However, to have such control over a Magical Beast required an extremely strong Spiritual Strength. Ordinary people were absolutely incapable of that.Using Spiritual Strength to connect and communicate with the Magical Beast, both beast and human could work together.Not only was the power of a battle housepet much greater, but the chance of it betraying its master was also much lower. However, it also required having your Spiritual Strength connected to the Magical Beast for a long time, which was also exhausting.Meng Qi didn\u2019t know about Long Chen\u2019s current strength. She had sent the cub in hopes that the Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf would follow Long Chen as it grew up and be an extra life-preserving measure in the future.But the current Long Chen was already a Pill Adept. Lu Fang-er directly imparted a few techniques for controlling Magical Beasts to him.What surprised Lu Fang-er was that Long Chen was able to comprehend the techniques with just a quick explanation. He would then ask a couple of questions that went right to the core of how the technique functioned.But there was a limit to how much Lu Fang-er could pass onto Long Chen. She could only teach him the common beast controlling techniques that circulated in the public. As for the core techniques of her sect, she didn\u2019t dare pass them on without permission.Long Chen\u2019s intelligence had completely won over Lu Fang-er. She realized Long Chen was definitely a monster. He remembered every word and comprehended everything almost immediately. He even asked her questions about ideas that she hadn\u2019t ever thought of.She stayed for half a day at the Long estate. After Lu Fang-er saw that Long Chen had completely comprehended all the techniques she passed on to him, she directly left.But before she left, Long Chen gave her the precious soul nourishing pill to give to Meng Qi.Once she left, Long Chen looked down at the little cub he was holding to his chest and couldn\u2019t help but feel a burst of warmth. The existence of this Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf was proof that he was present within Meng Qi\u2019s heart.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel extremely grand knowing that Meng Qi cared about him. He hoped to resolve everything in the capital as soon as possible so that he could step out of these uncivilized lands and enter that vaster sky.That was because he knew there was an unmatched beauty waiting for him. Thinking of Meng Qi, Long Chen felt his blood burn hotter. He had to quickly rise.\u201cWaaahhh!!\u201dSuddenly, the small cub in his arms let out a loud cry and started waddling all over his body.Looking at that little fellow, Long Chen smiled. But at that moment, he suddenly felt an extremely indistinct killing intent.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 News of His FatherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeThere was someone spying on him; that was his first reaction. However, even after spreading out his divine sense throughout the entire Long estate, he was unable to find anyone suspicious.But that feeling had definitely not been a mistake. With his perceptive spirit, he had definitely sensed that extremely indistinct killing intent.Long Chen was fully confident in his intuition. If there was no one suspicious in the Long household, then that meant the enemy was watching from further away.Seeing that the sky was already darkening, Long Chen muttered to himself and placed the puppy-like Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf back into its trunk.That trunk was something Lu Fang-er had brought over. Inside was a nourishing fluid that was enough for the cub to consume so that it wouldn\u2019t die.Setting up a proper place for the little cub, he then changed and left his estate.As expected, his intuition had been correct. As soon as he went past the gates, he sensed that he was being watched by people. A cold smile appeared on his face as he continued walking.He knew those people were preparing to kill him. If he had guessed correctly, they should have been waiting for nightfall to sneak into the Long estate and assassinate him.He preferred not to fight in his home, so he left. And as he had expected, after he walked a dozen miles away and entered a remote region with no one else present, a sharp whistling arrow was shot straight for his back.By the time he reacted and went on guard, it was already too late. He was shot through, groaning as he tumbled to the ground.Over ten figures surrounded Long Chen. Those people were all wearing veiled masks. Raising their swords, they completely cut off any retreat paths.\u201cHmph, what Phoenix Cry number one junior generation; he\u2019s just an idiot. He was handled so easily,\u201d sneered one of the masked men coldly.As soon as he finished his sentence, an arrow firmly shot him right through the stomach. His eyes widened and he didn\u2019t even dare look down at his stomach as he felt his life quickly fading.He tumbled to the ground. Even as he died, he had no idea just who it was that had killed him.\u201cCareful!\u201dThe others all immediately retreated, looking in shock at Long Chen. They noticed that the arrow on his back had disappeared.More importantly, Long Chen seemed absolutely fine! He got up from the ground and indifferently patted the dust off his clothes.Long Chen had long since been on guard, so how could it possibly have been so easy to ambush him? The very instant that arrow had been about to hit him, it had already been caught by him in midair.But he had faked being hit and tumbled to the ground powerlessly. Everything had been an act he had put on extremely convincingly. The reason he did this was to find out what this group had come for.The arrowhead didn\u2019t have any poison on it, and the twang of the bowstring had been too loud. Professional assassins definitely wouldn\u2019t randomly walk up to an enemy who wasn\u2019t confirmed to be dead.\u201cTogether!\u201dFollowing one of their shouts, the masked men suddenly released their auras. Blood Qi soared to the sky; every single one of them was a Blood Condensation expert.With a metallic ring, a sword appeared in Long Chen\u2019s hand. That was the weapon of the one he had killed. He used it now to block one of their attacks.The person whose attack he blocked felt his hand turn numb. The power behind Long Chen\u2019s sword was shockingly great. The sword in his hand was blown away, and he was knocked onto his back.A cold light flashed over that person\u2019s body, and he was split into two. A rain of blood descended for a moment.Now that Long Chen had condensed eleven cyclones that had reached a terrifying size, even a random blow from him was practically unstoppable.After easily killing a Blood Condensation expert with a wave of his sword, the pungent smell of blood filled the air. The cyclones in his body almost seemed to have been provoked, and without any urging from Long Chen, they started to circulate faster and faster.In just the blink of an eye, two members of their group had died. Both shock and rage filled them. They bellowed angrily and charged all at the same time, each of them stabbing towards one of Long Chen\u2019s vital points.Long Chen coldly snorted. Spiritual qi surged rapidly into his arms.Using just that one sword, Long Chen fended off the attacks of over ten people. With a crisp bang, qi waves surged out with shockingly terrifying fluctuations.With the combined force of over ten people, they forced Long Chen back several steps. He wasn\u2019t injured at all; however, his sword was unable to take such terrifying strength and shattered, leaving only the hilt.They were all greatly shocked that Long Chen was able to fend off their combined attack alone. Three of them were even at the mid Blood Condensation realm!\u201cGood, again!\u201dOne of them ordered. Although his voice was suppressed to be quiet, there was something indescribably strange about that voice.They didn\u2019t need this reminder since they all knew that this was the best moment. They all charged at the unarmed Long Chen.Looking at those masked black-robed attackers, a ridiculing smile appeared on his face. He lightly rubbed his ring.Golden light suddenly lit the sky up. A huge battle-ax cut through the air. It was just like the full moon as it swung through a mournful arc.Blood and broken limbs flew everywhere. The terrifying strength of the battle-ax dug a huge hole in the ground. Nine of them died under it; now there were only three remaining.And that was because those three were somewhat slower. When they had seen a huge battle-ax suddenly appear in his hands, they instinctively had slowed down slightly, allowing them to escape death.But while they had managed to survive, the others were not so lucky. In front of that huge battle-ax, the swords in their hands were no different from toys. All of them had been crushed into pieces.That huge power had even managed to impress Long Chen. This was the domineering style of heavy weapons. Your power would multiply, allowing you to completely crush your enemies head-on.But one of the drawbacks was that Long Chen needed two hands to hold the battle-ax. That was because the handle was too thick. At the same time, just one hand\u2019s strength was unable to draw out all of the potential power of the battle-ax.Although that battle-ax was extremely powerful, due to having used too much force, his arms ended up feeling extremely sore.\u201cNow it\u2019s time to send you guys to hell.\u201dHe slowly raised the huge battle-ax. Only then did the remaining three react. They immediately fled, disappearing in just a couple of blinks.Looking in the direction where those three were fleeing, Long Chen helplessly sighed. He sat himself down on the huge ax, seeming to not have the slightest intention of chasing after them.It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to chase, but that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to them even if he caught up. Due to underestimating the Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax\u2019s weight and power, he had misjudged how much strength to use and ended up dislocating his own shoulder. His raising of the battle-ax was just to scare them off. Otherwise, if they didn\u2019t flee, then he would be the one running.Twisting his shoulder, he popped it back into its socket. Suddenly, he turned to some bushes to the side and said, \u201cHaving hidden for so long, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to come out and say a few things?\u201dThose bushes remained silent. Long Chen smiled slightly, and suddenly, a red medicinal pill appeared in his hand. With a flick of his finger, the red pill fell into the bushes.That medicinal pill burst apart when it landed in the bushes. Countless strands of red smoke immediately filled the air. The smoke spread extremely quickly, reaching hundreds of meters away.That was a poison pill. The pills refined from alchemists didn\u2019t just save lives; they also could take lives. Long Chen had kept that poison pill for a long time. Back in the Heroic Assembly House when he had fought against Huang Chang, he had just been about to use it when the crown prince had walked in.That was a life-preserving measure. But now that he had even better medicinal pills, that pill had lost its use.A figure quickly fled from the bushes, rushing towards the distance.\u201cI\u2019d advise you not to run. Otherwise, in just a few minutes, the poison will reach your heart and you\u2019ll die,\u201d said Long Chen indifferently.That figure stopped and paused for a moment. Perhaps he was considering whether Long Chen was telling the truth or not, but in the end, he decided to stay.\u201cYoung master\u2019s techniques truly are worthy of praise.\u201dThat person slowly walked over and bowed. He appeared to be about in his twenties. He was slightly thin and appeared weak. His face was exceptionally plain, one that would be hard to pick out amongst a crowd.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cReporting to young master, this little one is Chen Fei. I was sent by your father to secretly protect his wife and son,\u201d said Chen Fei.\u201cMy father? Do you have any proof of that?\u201d Long Chen was pleasantly surprised, but he still needed proof.That person took out something from his robes and handed it to Long Chen. \u201cThis is a keepsake. I really am ashamed. I believe that young master should definitely recognize it.\u201dLong Chen immediately turned a bit sour when he saw that thing. It was a bamboo sword, the first gift his father had ever given to him as a child.At that time, he had only been two years old. He had been so excited back then that he had wildly brandished it as if he were a great expert.Back then, his father had accompanied him like that every day. He would occasionally give him encouragement as he wildly swung his bamboo sword, and his mother would laugh secretly to the side.Those were the soft and warm days of their three person family. Those days felt like they were just yesterday. He seemed to be able to see his father\u2019s strict but pampering expression.But a child was a child. A toy was something that didn\u2019t remain novel for long. He later became enraptured by real swords and blades. That bamboo sword was lost somewhere he had never bothered with.Looking at the bamboo sword now, he saw there was a bright shine to it. That was obviously something that could only be left behind by stroking it thousands of thousands of times.\u201cMaster really did wish to see his son and wife over these years, but he was absolutely unable to reunite with his family. However, if he learned that his son had reached such a level, he would definitely feel extremely gratified,\u201d said Chen Fei.Long Chen carefully put away the bamboo sword. This news of his father caused him to be even more excited than if he broke through his current realm.It had been so many years, but his father had never even once sent a letter back. Sometimes, he actually wondered if his father no longer wanted his wife and child. It would be a lie to say that he didn\u2019t have a bit of a grudge inside him.Hearing Chen Fei\u2019s words today, that sore point in his heart was finally released. At the same time, he was also a bit ashamed. In terms of trusting his father, he was far from equal to his mother.\u201cCome back to the estate. I have some things I want to talk about with you,\u201d said Long Chen. He had now understood many things. Although he didn\u2019t know the whole picture, he felt that he was now capable of changing his own fate.\u201cYoung master, you believe me just like this?\u201d Chen Fei was surprised.\u201cOf course, I believe you. That\u2019s because if you had lied just now, the current you would already be a corpse.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s because if you have lied just now, the current you would already become a corpse.\u201d Long Chen\u2019s light words were filled with self-confidence.Chen Fei was greatly alarmed. But examining his body, he didn\u2019t notice any changes.\u201cThat pill that I threw out is called the Soul Burning Pill. Even if you completely stopped your breath just now, it would be pointless. That poisonous gas directly erodes your pores and enters your bloodstream. If you use too much strength or fight intensely, your blood will begin to flow quicker and the poison will immediately invade your soul. At that time, your death would be doubtless,\u201d explained Long Chen.Chen Fei\u2019s expression changed. He had never imagined that Long Chen\u2019s poison pill would be so terrifying. But since Long Chen already trusted him, he definitely wouldn\u2019t deceive him now.\u201cThe reason why I believe you is because I am confident in my pills. If you had lied when I questioned you just now, your blood would have begun circulating faster. By then, blood would flow out of your seven apertures. Here, eat this.\u201dLong Chen handed Chen Fei a medicinal pill. Chen Fei directly swallowed it.\u201cAfter taking this pill, the poison in your body will be detoxified. However, the effect is a bit slow, so you cannot undergo any intense fights for the next three days. Okay, let\u2019s go.\u201dLong Chen directly started walking back home. Chen Fei hastily went to keep up with him. They left behind a miserable area of blood and severed limbs.\u2026\u201cBastard, you actually dare try to kill Long Chen behind my back? Do you think that I won\u2019t dare to kill you?\u201d Within a secret room, a white-robed man was angrily cursing at Xia Changfeng. A murderous aura came from him.At the same time, a terrifying killing intent seemed to take a solid form and locked Xia Changfeng in place. Xia Changfeng felt as if a cold blade was pressed against his neck. As long as the white-robed man wished it, his life would be over in an instant.\u201cBrother Luo, listen to me. This wasn\u2019t done by me! My sister ordered my subordinates. I knew nothing about it!\u201dXia Changfeng was completely terrified as he tried to explain the situation. Sweat had completely drenched his robes, as that killing intent was just too terrifying. Even he, a Blood Condensation expert, was unable to block it. He felt as if he were a tiny ant that was completely unable to resist.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m an idiot? Do you really think your guards would follow the orders of your sister without your go-ahead? You obviously wanted to remove that thorn Long Chen before you left. It\u2019s lucky that Long Chen didn\u2019t die, otherwise, this matter would have truly blown up. Even if you had ten lives, you wouldn\u2019t be able to block the anger from those higher-ups,\u201d shouted the white-robed man coldly.Xia Changfeng lowered his head and didn\u2019t dare say anything. It was true that the assassination attempt of Long Chen had been arranged by Xia Baichi, but the white-robed man was entirely correct. He had lent his personal guards to her.He had hoped that once Long Chen was dead, he could push the blame onto Xia Baichi. With her Pill Adept status, she should be fine.Having already borrowed so much money from Xia Baichi at the auction, he had been forced by her to provide help.However, he hadn\u2019t expected that a group of Blood Condensation experts would fail and only have three of their members return. But before he could even clearly ask about what had happened, that white-robed man had already arrived.\u201cXia Changfeng, this is your last warning. Your job is minor. If the bigger plots go wrong, even your entire Grand Xia is unable to handle the punishment, let alone you. Go back and tell your stupid sister that if she dares to take such a rash course once more, I will personally twist off her head. That old pervert Wei Cang never once truly placed her in his eyes,\u201d snorted the white-robed man coldly.\u201cYes, yes, Changfeng will definitely properly instruct his sister. I definitely won\u2019t cause any more trouble.\u201d Xia Changfeng nodded his head over and over.\u201cLong Tianxiao has already stated that if anything unexpected happens to his wife or son, he will give up his border post and kill his way into the capital. That is the situation we want to avoid the most, do you understand?\u201d The white-robed man coldly continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve been constantly testing his bottom line, but Long Tianxiao refuses to give us any reaction. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t care about his wife and son. He is someone who either doesn\u2019t take action or strikes like lightning. That is him warning you guys, but you idiots weren\u2019t even able to understand that.\u201d\u201cBrother Luo, I still don\u2019t understand. With brother Luo\u2019s skill, why don\u2019t you go and directly kill Long Tianxiao?\u201d asked Xia Changfeng.\u201cIdiot, if I really could just take action in the open, do you think I\u2019d still need you guys? Furthermore, Long Tianxiao is also a Tendon Transformation expert. How is he so easy to kill? If I don\u2019t succeed in one blow and news of it spreads, who is going to take responsibility for that?\u201d cursed the white-robed man.Xia Changfeng immediately felt awkward, but he didn\u2019t dare retort. He just endured it obediently. But his hatred towards Long Chen only continued to grow.Xia Baichi\u2019s actions were actually something he had also wanted. But since Long Chen hadn\u2019t died, the anger inside him could only continue to be stifled.He really had never imagined that over ten Blood Condensation experts working together would still be unable to kill him. Moreover, his losses were actually so great.When Xia Changfeng returned to his room, that white-robed man sighed. It had been troublesome for him to get such an easy mission, but perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be as easy as he had thought.He had been so enraged just now that he had almost slaughtered Xia Changfeng. But he couldn\u2019t actually do that. The plan had been in motion for many years. In fact, he had originally come here to reap the final profits that someone else had worked for.However, the result was that he felt as if everyone around him was completely stupid, infuriating him. He had a stomach full of anger that he had nowhere to let out.He didn\u2019t dare show himself publicly, so he needed to work together with the Grand Xia. A cold smile appeared on his face.If you really ruin my plans, then all of you can just die here!\u2026It was already late into the night by the time Long Chen returned home. Once he was in his room, he carefully looked over Chen Fei. He was surprised to find that his aura was extremely veiled. Even with Chen Fei right in front of him, it was still difficult to sense his existence.\u201cI train in a special cultivation technique that increases my ability to hide my aura. Young master doesn\u2019t need to think it\u2019s strange.\u201dAlthough he was modest, inside he was still a bit conceited. He had absolute confidence in his aura concealing techniques.Long Chen nodded. Chen Fei was truly quite good at that, as he hadn\u2019t noticed the slightest trace of him until that time.Today, when his sword had been shattered, and it seemed as if he might be in danger, Chen Fei had ended up giving off some of his aura. Otherwise, he still wouldn\u2019t have noticed him.At that time, he had clearly been about to intervene. Also, Long Chen hadn\u2019t sensed any hostility at that time, so he knew Chen Fei was trying to save him.That was why Long Chen had originally guessed that Chen Fei didn\u2019t have any evil intentions against him. But to be safe, he had still decided to use the poison pill.The current Long family was in an extremely unstable position. At any moment, it might capsize. He didn\u2019t dare to be the slightest bit careless, and he refused to gamble the lives of his Long household\u2019s people.\u201cHow are things where my father is?\u201d Taking a deep breath, Long Chen go to the point. He was extremely curious about what was going on with his father.So much time had passed that even his memories of his father had become indistinct. But his father\u2019s love from his childhood still remained deeply buried in his heart.\u201cYour father is safe and sound. However, in the most recent years, the battles with the barbarian tribes have become increasingly intense. Not to mention the lack of reinforcements from the capital, his original army of fifty thousand troops has shrunk to only twenty thousand. Luckily, the surrounding commoners care about your father\u2019s benevolence, sending him women and sons to supplement his army as well as army provisions. If it weren\u2019t for them, we\u2019d have long since been unable to persevere.\u201dAnger could be heard within his voice.The capital\u2019s attitude towards Long Tianxiao truly was a bitter disappointment. If it weren\u2019t for them seeing the many commoners\u2019 ardent gazes, they would have already left.The barbarian tribes were actually many separate tribes. They were simply grouped together as barbarian tribes as a generic group term. Born in the savage wilderness, they had to use cruel methods just to survive in their harsh environment. They hunted and gathered their food, just barely managing to survive. But that harsh environment actually ended up tempering them, and most of their population was much stronger than an ordinary commoner.As they grew stronger, they naturally began to develop and spread out, claiming more and more lands. In the end, they had found the border of the Phoenix Cry Empire with its rich lands and produces. Plundering this place was much easier than hunting.The reason they were called barbarian tribes was also because they lived their lives very differently from ordinary people. Whole families would sleep together on the same bed. They also copulated without any regard to generation or sex. It definitely seemed chaotic to others.Other than their own tribe, the other tribes were just prey. Tribes would attack other tribes indiscriminately. And if they ended up capturing Phoenix Cry\u2019s commoners, the men would just be killed and stored as food, while the women would be used for sex and then killed for food.Phoenix Cry\u2019s commoners both hated and were afraid of them. The barbarian tribes ended up plundering more and more as time went on, and only once that had reached a shocking point had the empire finally reacted.Unfortunately. the barbarian tribes actually had a surprisingly large population. They traveled like the wind, disappearing one night and appearing at a whole new place. They weren\u2019t like Phoenix Cry\u2019s commoners who had set residences. It was basically impossible to find their nest, and so Phoenix Cry\u2019s troops could only stay on the defense.But once Long Tianxiao was sent to the border, he repeatedly launched sneak attacks against the barbarian tribes, causing the rivers to run red with their blood. This ended up intimidating the barbarian tribes, while the commoners near the border could all take a breath of relief and live in peace. That was how Long Tianxiao ended up becoming a military god in the eyes of the commoners.As Long Tianxiao\u2019s army fought with the barbarian tribes, the frequent raids ended up costing a great deal. Without reinforcements, the army\u2019s troops quickly dwindled.Seeing this happen, the surrounding commoners all helped and supported him to the best of their abilities. If they had extra manpower, then they sent their sons to join the army. If they had extra money, then they sent food over. Everything they could afford was sent to Border Suppression Army.However, that kind of supply was far from enough. When the army wasn\u2019t fighting, they would always go help the commoners farm, which was also a way to increase their own supplies.So, the commoners and army men along the border were basically all one family now. Recalling their eyes that were filled with hope and expectation, Chen Fei\u2019s eyes reddened slightly. Even if they had to die, they definitely wouldn\u2019t allow those commoners to suffer any harm.Chen Fei told all this to Long Chen, allowing him to finally understand his father\u2019s secret troubles. On one side were his wife and son, while on the other were the lives of millions of innocent commoners.If it was Long Chen instead, he would also be hard-pressed to choose. That grievance he had had against his father melted into nothing, and pride filled his heart. A brave expert who fights for an empire\u2019s people; that was a true hero!\u201cChen Fei, return to where my father is.\u201d Long Chen thought about it but still ended up wanting him to return.Chen Fei\u2019s expression changed. \u201cI absolutely cannot.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 Little SnowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cI absolutely cannot.\u201d Chen Fei explained, \u201cJust before I left to come here, your father ordered me that I absolutely, no matter what, had to stay here to protect his wife and son. Even in death.\u201dLong Chen shook his head, \u201cAlthough you are a late Blood Condensation expert, you are no longer able to protect me. The fact that you didn\u2019t help me back when I was injured on the martial arena means that you are extremely apprehensive and will only act to help once I am facing death. But at that time, even if you did help, you wouldn\u2019t be able to fix anything. Am I right?\u201dChen Fei was silent for a long while. That was because Long Chen\u2019s words were absolutely true and he couldn\u2019t refute them.\u201cWithin the capital, the only person who could make you feel so apprehensive should be Marquis Ying, correct?\u201d asked Long Chen.Chen Fei sighed and nodded. \u201cCorrect. Your father warned me over and over again not to let Marquis Ying notice me, otherwise, my life would be over. I\u2019m not afraid of death, but I am afraid of betraying your father\u2019s expectations. That\u2019s why despite you being bullied so much, I could only continue to stay my hand. I truly am sorry.\u201d\u201cDoes my father have enmity with Marquis Ying?\u201d\u201cMarquis Ying\u2019s finger was severed by your father,\u201d laughed Chen Fei.No wonder Marquis Ying would target me. Father really is ferocious. But I won\u2019t fall behind; my father severed a finger, while I made him lose all his money.\u201cWhen did you first come to the capital?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cThree years ago.\u201d\u201cAnd how many experts on your level does my father have beside him?\u201d\u201cThere were originally seven, but one of them died after many years of fighting, so there are only six now.\u201d\u201cWhat Heavenstage have you reached?\u201d\u201cThe ninth Heavenstage of Blood Condensation. But unfortunately, I\u2019ve never been able to break through the next barrier,\u201d sighed Chen Fei. He was already thirty-seven years old. If he still wasn\u2019t able to break through by the age of forty, it would essentially be impossible for him to do so for the rest of his life.Long Chen wasn\u2019t that surprised. Although Chen Fei was extremely good at hiding his aura, Blood Qi had emerged from the space between his eyebrows. That was a clear sign of blood being condensed to its densest state.In other words, Chen Fei had to be at the peak of Blood Condensation. Unfortunately, he was unable to break through the next barrier.To break through the Blood Condensation realm to reach the Tendon Transformation realm was extremely difficult. There were thousands of Blood Condensation experts in Phoenix Cry, but only three Tendon Transformation experts. The two were separated by a huge chasm that caused everyone who stood in front of it to despair.\u201cChen Fei, I\u2019ll refine some pills tonight. Bring them to my father.\u201d Long Chen was almost talking to himself.\u201cYoung master, this\u2026\u201dLong Chen waved his hand, cutting him off. \u201cAlthough your aura concealing techniques are exquisite, allowing you to hide from even Marquis Ying\u2019s senses, the entire Phoenix Cry capital is undergoing intense undercurrents. That means that the entire empire will soon be flipped; whether you stay or not has no meaning. If my Long family truly did reach that end point where you would finally take action, do you really think you could manage to fight against that tide with just your strength?\u201d\u201cI can bring you out alive,\u201d said Chen Fei.Long Chen\u2019s face darkened. \u201cAnd what about my mother?\u201dChen Fei was immediately speechless. His aura concealing techniques were powerful, but he was actually even stronger when it came to his fleeing techniques. He was confident that even if Marquis Ying was the opponent, he would still have an eighty percent chance of saving Long Chen.But he really was unable to reply when it came to Long Chen\u2019s mother. He could at most bring along one extra person. In other words, his mother would have to be a sacrifice.\u201cSorry young master, but these are my master\u2019s orders. I must follow them,\u201d Chen Fei shook his head.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help being both startled and furious. His father had actually decided to sacrifice his mother to save him in that situation. Perhaps that was because of his pampering of him, but he was completely unable to accept that.Taking a deep breath, Long Chen suppressed his fury and coldly said, \u201cChen Fei, I\u2019m not arguing with you. I am ordering you. Don\u2019t end up hurting me and my mother just for some silly order. I\u2019m going to the alchemist guild right now to get some medicinal ingredients. I\u2019ll spend all night refining, and you will bring them to my father. Don\u2019t even speak about saving me and my mother. If I wanted your life right now, it would be as effortless as blowing off dust. Right now, I have the strength to temporarily protect the Long household. But events are rapidly turning, and I need my father\u2019s help quickly. So now I\u2019m giving you two options. Listen to me and return to my father\u2019s side. Or die here. Without more of the antidote, the poison will still inevitably kill you.\u201dChen Fei\u2019s expression became a mix of green and white. He could easily hear the fury within Long Chen\u2019s words. He could almost see the image of Long Tianxiao within him. He was certain that if he dared to disobey, Long Chen really would take his life.He wasn\u2019t afraid of death, but such a meaningless death truly would not be worth it. Anyways, this was a matter for the Long family. He could only bitterly smile and agree. Of course, inside he was extremely agonized. Just how was he supposed to face Long Tianxiao once he returned?Long Chen went straight to the alchemist guild. Now that he had so much money from the auction, he no longer needed to worry about buying medicinal ingredients on credit. Coming to the guild now had definitely been a smart decision, as they had all the medicinal ingredients he required.Using Chen Fei as a guard, Long Chen directly started using his flame to warm the furnace. The pill he was refining this time was called the Breaking Barrier Pill.It was an extremely ordinary second tier medicinal pill that could increase the chance of breaking through bottlenecks.But the medicinal formula Long Chen was using had come from the Pill God\u2019s memories. It used the same medicinal ingredients, but through merging them in different proportions, it created an entirely different effect.In addition, Long Chen had added Dragon Bone Grass as well. That kind of intense medicinal ingredient would increase the pill\u2019s medicinal energy. This was no longer an ordinary Breaking Barrier Pill.This Breaking Barrier Pill was used to attack the Tendon Transformation realm. The lower grade Breaking Barrier Pill could give people an extra ten percent chance of breaking through.But the one Long Chen was planning on refining was a higher quality pill and could give cultivators an extra thirty percent chance of breaking through. If that was learned by others, it would definitely shake the current world.Such a medicinal pill was even more shocking that the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill from the auction. In reality, that Flesh Bone Restoration Pill had a large flaw; however, Long Chen hadn\u2019t told them about it.If an ordinary person would to have their limbs severed, then they really could grow a new limb without any problems.But if a cultivator took it, they would use their Spirit Root\u2019s true spiritual core energy to heal it. That would end up shortening their peak potential.Back then, Long Chen had cut off Fu Gui\u2019s arm, and he had healed it without causing any problems. But later when Yao Niqian called up Zhao Yang\u2026 well, in any case, adventurers were in constant danger of being cut like that. And it wasn\u2019t as if Zhao Yang could have resisted Yao Niqian\u2019s charm anyway.\u2026BOOM!The medicinal furnace shook. Opening it, three round medicinal pills appeared. A faint glimmer shined off them, causing a weary Long Chen to smile.This was his third furnace of pills. The first time he had succeeded in refining three pills. But the second time he had just been slightly distracted for a moment, causing an explosion. The pill furnace only narrowly managed to avoid being destroyed. However, the ingredients had turned to ashes.Refining pills was simply like that. Just the slightest inattentiveness could easily cause failure. Even with all the techniques of a Pill God, it would be impossible to avoid some failures.His goal had been to refine two furnaces worth of pills. Now that he had failed once, he had no choice but to attempt a third one despite his exhaustion.The Breaking Barrier Pill, which had the Dragon Bone Grass added to it, was extremely hard to refine. Even with Long Chen\u2019s powerful Spiritual Strength, he was still completely exhausted.But looking at the six medicinal pills, he felt that all that exhaustion was worth it. He handed them to a shocked Chen Fei in addition to a letter.Chen Fei left before the break of dawn. Long Chen took a quick nap to re-energize himself. Waking up, he realized he felt much freer and less worried.The matter of his father had always been pressing on him like a huge boulder. Now that he had finally learned of his father\u2019s situation, he was filled with anticipation.The only thing that kept worrying him was that Chen Fei hadn\u2019t known just who was targeting his father. Long Tianxiao had never told anyone about that.But that wasn\u2019t too important anymore. Now that he had news of his father, he was filled with fighting spirit.Getting out of bed, he placed Little Snow in front of him. Little Snow was what Long Chen had decided to name the Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf.Little Snow\u2019s eyes were still permanently closed as he cried and fussed. Long Chen smiled slightly and bit down on his finger, drawing a drop of blood. He dripped the blood into Little Snow\u2019s mouth.When Little Snow swallowed that drop of blood, his closed eyes finally opened slowly. He curiously looked up at Long Chen. His large eyes plus the small tuft of red hair on his forehead were indescribably cute.For most Magical Beasts, the flavor of the first blood they tasted would be forever remembered. The owner of that blood would then become their family. Of course, cold-blooded Magical Beasts were excepted from this. There were different techniques for them.As soon as Little Snow opened his eyes, he slowly started to crawl over to Long Chen. His walking was extremely unstable and he might trip and fall at any moment, but he still continued crawling towards him.[1]Long Chen felt a burst of warmth when he looked at the little fellow. With his powerful Spiritual Strength, he could clearly sense the yearning within Little Snow\u2019s soul.As soon as Little Snow approved of Long Chen, Long Chen was supposed to use his Spiritual Strength to use the secret techniques Lu Fang-er had taught him. That would place a kind of slave imprint on Little Snow\u2019s soul so that he could never betray him.But Long Chen continued to hesitate about using the slave imprint. He couldn\u2019t bear to make this little guy a slave.Pondering over this, he suddenly felt his face become wet. That little guy had crawled onto his lap and was enthusiastically washing his face.Long Chen laughed and hugged the little guy. He brought Little Snow out of the Long estate to the outskirts of the city. Now that the little guy had opened his eyes, it was time for him to temper himself.Magical Beasts had an extremely tenacious vitality. As soon as they opened their eyes, they were essentially capable of finding and eating their own food. They would no longer require that nutrient fluid they had needed as a cub.Bringing him out of the city was precisely the fastest way for Little Snow to mature.But before he left the city, he still had to find a certain someone. In just an hour, Long Chen arrived at a large pasture.Suddenly, a huge roar rang out, and the entire earth trembled along with it. A smile appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 Twelfth Level of Qi CondensationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeThe southern pass was almost a thousand miles to the southwest of the capital. It was a narrow pass between sharp mountains and cliffs that represented the border with the Grand Xia.Within the mountain range were huge trees that reached for the sky and countless wild beasts. Magical Beasts even occasionally roamed there. It was a wild land with no signs of human habitation.The southern pass had a mountain valley that was sided by tall, precipitous cliffs. The mountain valley had to be traversed in order to get to the Grand Xia.BOOM!Within the depths of the mountain range was a secluded pool. Long Chen was sitting cross-legged on a boulder. With another muffled bang from within his body, a twelfth cyclone was born.The originally three-meter-wide cyclones immediately grew to become a terrifying thirty meters. It really did make him feel numb.For most Qi Condensation cultivators, their cyclones were only the size of a fist. Some of them might have their cyclones be a foot wide. If a person\u2019s cyclone was two feet long, then that would qualify them as a legendary genius. But Long Chen\u2019s cyclones had already reached an incomparable size.[1]The size of the cyclones dictated how quickly you could absorb spiritual qi from heaven and earth. Even once you advanced to Blood Condensation, your cyclones would still remain. In other words, your cyclones were your ultimate way of absorbing spiritual qi.Normally, you would be extremely happy to have your cyclones grow larger. But once they grew so large that it was inconceivable, that would naturally be startling and frightening.Long Chen looked inside his Dantian. The twelve cyclones were like a group of huge mouths that were voraciously devouring heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi.The spiritual qi in this place was much denser than in the capital. Long Chen had managed to break through in just a couple of days.He was becoming more and more worried and uncertain about the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Just when was the end of this? The size of the cyclones was now completely shocking.Just as Long Chen was thinking things over, a snow-white little fellow jumped onto the huge rock he was on and wiggled into his embrace.Looking at that adorable fellow, Long Chen immediately put aside those worries and picked him up.Lu Fang-er had taught Long Chen how to raise Magical Beasts. Over the past two days, Long Chen had caught several wild pheasants and used their blood to nourish Little Snow.What had caused Long Chen to click his tongue in wonder was that Magical Beasts truly were Magical Beasts; as soon as Little Snow had drunk their blood, he had immediately started to grow stronger, no longer stumbling and staggering when he walked.What was most inconceivable to him was that despite Little Snow not having any teeth, he actually had tightly bit down on the pheasant, tearing away a piece of flesh and swallowing it in one gulp.But Little Snow\u2019s throat wasn\u2019t wide enough and the food got stuck. The little guy ended up rolling around in panic. Long Chen was given a fright and hastily picked the food out of his throat.But the little guy actually seemed to act on instinct and immediately started to tear at more flesh.Long Chen was helpless to that and could only tear the pheasant into small enough pieces for him. However, the result was that Long Chen\u2019s eyes almost popped out of his head.Little Snow was originally only a bit larger than a hand, but he actually managed to finish half the pheasant which was almost twice his size!Even after half that pheasant, Little Snow\u2019s belly only enlarged slightly. He then crawled beside Long Chen and took a long nap. After the nap, he actually began to eat again.In just a couple of days, he had already grown to become a foot long. He had even grown four new teeth. Although they were still extremely immature, Little Snow still had enough power behind them to tear his food on his own now.The little fellow actually appeared very fierce, but he was extremely affectionate with Long Chen. After he was tired, he would crawl into Long Chen\u2019s embrace and doze off. Sometimes, he would even lick Long Chen\u2019s face.Unfortunately, now Long Chen really couldn\u2019t use him to wash his face. Now that Little Snow had started to eat flesh, the smell was a bit too strong.Long Chen gently stroked Little Snow. Whenever he looked at the little fellow, he would think of Meng Qi\u2019s perfectly beautiful image. A fire would burn within his heart.BOOM!Long Chen saw that a couple of miles away in a forest, a huge tree toppled down. At the same time, an earth-shaking roar rang out.Long Chen shook his head and rushed over there while holding Little Snow. Arriving at the jungle, he saw that the forest now had an area hundreds of meters wide that was a complete mess. The trees in this area had all been snapped and crushed.Within the center of that disorderly zone was a huge figure holding a three-meter-long huge Savage Bull.\u201cWilde, how many times have I told you to use a bit of skill when hunting? Use the smallest amount of energy to achieve your goal.\u201d Long Chen looked helplessly at Wilde.\u201cHehe, brother Long, I remembered what you said right up till the point I saw my prey.\u201d Wilde scratched his head in embarrassment.Looking at the huge bull whose neck had been snapped, he didn\u2019t know just what to say.Wilde\u2019s strength seemed endless. He was just like a terrifying Magical Beast in human form. But it seemed that when it came to using skillful techniques, he didn\u2019t have any talent at all.Along their path, in order to keep himself full, Wilde had already killed four Magical Beasts. Although this Savage Bull was just a first rank Magical Beast, its strength was still shocking. An ordinary Blood Condensation cultivator wasn\u2019t necessarily a match for it.But it was nothing more than a chicken in front of Wilde. Its neck had been broken without it having the slightest ability to resist.Wilde\u2019s favorite method of fighting was to directly use his full force to completely overwhelm his opponent. This caused quite a headache for Long Chen.It was just like he was Magical Beast. He favored attacking instinctively. He could remember things while not fighting, but as soon as he was in battle, everything would be thrown out of his head.\u201cOkay, well let\u2019s handle this bull for now. I\u2019ll skin off the fur and bury the viscera.\u201dLong Chen took out a sharp knife and began to skin the bull. That kind of meticulous work was something he didn\u2019t even bother trying to get Wilde to do. Maybe if it was crushing the bull into a pulp he could ask Wilde to do it.The scent of a Magical Beast\u2019s blood could spread extremely far. Even if it was a hundred miles away, other Magical Beasts could smell it. After gutting and skinning it, Wilde brought the meat back to the camp.The camp location Long Chen had chosen was behind a waterfall. There was a natural cave there, a ready-made shelter.In addition, the flowing waterfall could block their scent, making it more difficult for other Magical Beasts to notice them.Although they weren\u2019t afraid of ordinary Magical Beasts, being sneak attacked was also extremely troublesome. If it was a venomous Magical Beast, then that would be a fatal danger.The cave was very wide. Long Chen started a fire and cooked the bull on a frame over the flame, roasting it. In less than two hours, a fragrant smell filled the cave.When Little Snow smelled it and saw the huge bull, he struggled free of Long Chen\u2019s embrace and charged right at it.Long Chen was startled and hastily grabbed him. If he was a bit slower, then Little Snow would have already jumped into the fire.Although that wouldn\u2019t burn him to death, his snow-white fur would all be scorched.\u201cDon\u2019t make trouble.\u201d Long Chen put on an angry expression for Little Snow.The little fellow seemed to be able to sense Long Chen\u2019s anger and immediately became more obedient. His large eyes stared into the ground, and he didn\u2019t dare look Long Chen in the eyes, seeming to acknowledge his error.Although Long Chen hadn\u2019t placed a slave imprint on him, with a couple of the techniques Lu Fang-er had left him that were used to communicate and connect with him, he was still able to clearly express his state of mind.But if a slave imprint had been placed on him, he could make him die with just a thought. He would never be able to betray him or even having any thoughts of betraying him.Long Chen didn\u2019t treat the little fellow as a slave, but more as a partner and companion. After all, the current Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf was just like a child, so he still needed Long Chen\u2019s help to figure out what he shouldn\u2019t do.Little Snow peeked up and saw that Long Chen\u2019s expression was still gloomy. He slowly raised his head and started rubbing back and forth against Long Chen\u2019s chin, almost as if he was petting him.Long Chen wanted to laugh inside, but he still endured. If he let it end just like this, then Little Snow would be even bolder next time. He had to teach him a lesson.The little fellow rubbed him for a long time. Seeing that Long Chen\u2019s face still remained dark, he actually lowered his head and started to cry.Long Chen practically couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes. Carefully examining him, he confirmed that they really were tears. His nose even sneezed a few times as if he were choked with sobs.\u201cOkay, well, next time don\u2019t act like that. It\u2019s dangerous and will hurt you. Understood?\u201d Long Chen bitterly smiled and gently rubbed Little Snow\u2019s head.The little fellow seemed to have understood Long Chen\u2019s meaning and once more started using his small head to rub Long Chen\u2019s chin.Long Chen sighed. It seemed he also had to worry about this fellow as well. Looking to the side where Wilde was currently salivating, he felt a huge headache oncoming.When it was essentially cooked, Long Chen cut off a large piece and gave it to Little Snow. The little fellow didn\u2019t like eating ground meat and preferred torn off pieces.Long Chen merely cut off several kilograms of meat. The rest was all given to Wilde because Wilde\u2019s stomach seemed to be like a bottomless pit that would never be full.Even though he already was well aware of Wilde\u2019s appetite, seeing him practically sucked up the wild bull that was several tons in an instant still caused him to feel some shock. Looking from the bones on the ground to Wilde who still seemed to want to keep eating, Long Chen didn\u2019t know just what to say.According to Wilde, Magical Beasts\u2019 meat tasted exceptionally good to him and after eating he would feel as if his full body was filled with power. It was much more efficient than eating beef.Long Chen once more examined Wilde\u2019s body and found that those sleeping cells were all gradually recovering, a very good sign.At the same time, he also realized that Magical Beast meat was extremely important to Wilde. It seemed that the stronger the meat, the more it would help Wilde grow.After eating, Little Snow\u2019s belly was as round as ball. He crawled up next to Wilde and started snoring. Long Chen also started to cultivate. Since there was no way for him to advance to Blood Condensation, he might as well just condense another cyclone.As for Wilde, he hesitated for a moment. With the Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax on his back, he continued to go hunting. It seemed he really would never be full.The next day at noon, a burst of wind blew by, bringing with it a couple of voices. The cultivating Long Chen slowly opened his eyes. The person he had been waiting for had finally arrived.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were a dozen guards around the carriage.Suddenly, the carriage paused. Inside the carriage, Xia Changfeng frowned and irritably asked, \u201cWhy have we stopped?\u201dThe reason Xia Changfeng was returning back to the Grand Xia was due to two reasons. Not only did he want to prepare for his wedding with Phoenix Cry\u2019s third princess, but the white-robed man had also ordered him to prepare for more important matters.That was why Xia Changfeng had ordered his subordinates to travel throughout the day and night as quickly as possible. They had only used one day and one night\u2019s time to arrive at the southern pass\u2019s valley.With another half a day of travel, they would exit the valley and arrive in the Grand Xia.Traveling on a flying Magical Beast would be much faster, but due to how many people he had, that was not an option. Furthermore, flying Magical Beasts were large targets. If they ended up running into a stronger group of flying Magical Beasts, they would definitely die without the slightest chance of fleeing.\u201cPrince, there are people blocking the path,\u201d reported one of the guards outside the carriage.\u201cWho?\u201d Xia Changfeng was startled.\u201cPeople you\u2019re familiar with.\u201dXia Changfeng frowned and exited his carriage. The valley was extremely narrow here. If they wanted to get through this pass, they had to go through that junction.But at that narrow opening were two figures standing there calmly. When he saw who they were, Xia Changfeng laughed, and a dark light flashed in his eyes.\u201cLong Chen, are you waiting here to say goodbye?\u201d Xia Changfeng waved his hand and his guards all spread out, quickly forming a half-ring around Long Chen and Wilde.Long Chen looked at Xia Changfeng and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Seeing how arduous your travels are, I decided to get here a step earlier and help send you on your way.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you two are here because you think you can assassinate me?\u201d Xia Changfeng sneered.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think assassinate is the right word. We\u2019re slaughtering today.\u201d[1] His face turned icy cold as he pointed at Xia Changfeng. \u201cI won\u2019t play any more meaningless word games with you. You bastard, was the hidden energy within Chu Yao\u2019s body your doing?\u201dBeing reminded of Chu Yao\u2019s experiences, Long Chen\u2019s killing intent soared. Currently, Chu Yao could essentially count as his woman, so he was completely unable to accept such a thing.At the same time, Chu Yao\u2019s experiences reminded him of his own. If what had happened to his body was related to Xia Changfeng, then Xia Changfeng was his greatest chance of finding the true person behind this.Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression changed slightly. Obviously, Long Chen\u2019s words startled him, but he coldly replied, \u201cIt seems you actually know quite a bit. But that\u2019s not a problem. A dead man can know as much as he wants without any harm.\u201dThis reply was extremely vague and wasn\u2019t what Long Chen had been hoping to hear. However, he could now confirm for sure that Xia Changfeng knew many things.Long Chen laughed. Perhaps he would be able to learn many of those secrets from Xia Changfeng today.\u201cLong Chen, I originally thought that you were a smart guy. But today I find that I was wrong. Nonetheless, I\u2019m actually pretty happy that I was wrong. You actually dared to come here to assassinate me with just the two of you? I don\u2019t know whether to praise you for your boldness or to laugh at your stupidity. Looks like after killing Huang Chang, your appetite has really grown without limit. Do you think you are unmatched under the heavens? Wang Mang, weren\u2019t you always complaining I didn\u2019t give you a chance to display your feelings? Here, the chance has come. Go cut off that arrogant kid\u2019s head,\u201d said Xia Changfeng disdainfully.Xia Changfeng\u2019s last sentence was towards one of his guards. That Wang Mang was extremely tall and strong, and his face was as black as coal.Hearing Xia Changfeng\u2019s command, he sneered, revealing a set of sinister white teeth, appearing just like a bloodthirsty animal.Wang Mang was also one of his guards that was just like Huang Chang. He was one of Xia Changfeng\u2019s secret weapons.However, Huang Chang was in the sun while he was in the dark. Anyone who knew Xia Changfeng had known about Huang Chang, but no one had known about this black-faced guard.\u201cDon\u2019t worry master; I can crush him in less than ten exchanges.\u201d Wang Mang laughed and rushed forward.A long broadsword was pulled out of its sheath in Wang Mang\u2019s hands, causing Long Chen\u2019s eyes to narrow slightly.Most broadswords were only slightly wider than regular swords, a width of around four fingers. That was because as the width increased, the thickness also had to increase. In the end, a broadsword was many times heavier than a regular sword.Most cultivators that could use broadswords were those specialized in power. And as for Wang Mang, his broadsword had reached a shocking width of seven inches.Seven inches wide and three inches thick. Its weight was definitely shocking. Before the sword even reached, a terrifying whistling gale had already blown over. The air revolved around it as it chopped down at Long Chen.\u201cYou\u2019re mine!\u201d Long Chen didn\u2019t move. Behind him, Wilde shouted and the Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax in his hand cut through the air. It turned into a whistling golden light that clashed with Wang Mang\u2019s broadsword.Sparks shot everywhere and an ear-ringing explosion rang out. Some of the guards had their eardrums split from the explosive ringing. Blood slowly flowed out of their ears, and they were unable to hear anything after.Both sides were blown back. Wilde thudded back three steps before stabilizing.But Wang Mang was blown ten meters back despite doing his best to stabilize himself. His legs left behind two deep scars on the ground.After just that one earth-shattering exchange, all of Xia Changfeng\u2019s men looked at the giant Wilde with horror.When Xia Changfeng saw Wilde\u2019s Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax, his pupils shrunk as he recognized it from the auction. That was something that weighed over two tons!Looking at Wilde\u2019s stature and huge hands, it was as if that battle-ax had been custom made for him! It wasn\u2019t heavy at all to him.While Xia Changfeng was shocked, Wang Mang was even more shocked. Ever since he had been a child, he had always possessed an extremely great innate strength. That broadsword in his hand weighed over a ton, and by using it in combat, there were extremely few people in the same realm as him who could manage to endure even three exchanges.Although Huang Chang was also one of Xia Changfeng\u2019s secret weapons, Wang Mang would still be able to defeat him in ten exchanges even if he used his beast transformation.However, now he was forced back by a blockhead who didn\u2019t have the slightest fluctuations of a cultivation base. Not only was he shocked, but he was also infuriated.Wang Mang roared and Blood Qi soared from his body. He had originally been planning on fighting Long Chen, so he hadn\u2019t wanted to display his full strength. Reserving his strength was simply his habit from being raised with Huang Chang as one of Xia Changfeng\u2019s secret weapons.But now there was someone who might actually surpass him in terms of brute strength. His anger soared; he definitely would not allow such a person to emerge!The sword in his hand shivered and space began to rumble. This time the gale winds released from his broadsword sounded even more mournful, almost as if Yama King of Hell was demanding lives.This kind of harsh and cold attack was extremely terrifying. But while Long Chen was shocked, he was also relieved.Wang Mang was someone who focused on pure power and didn\u2019t like skillful techniques. Although his style was simple, his killing power was also great.Luckily, this kind of attack was the easiest for the simple Wilde to handle. That was because Wilde also didn\u2019t understand any skilled techniques.BOOM!They once more collided fiercely, intensely shaking the earth and releasing terrifying qi waves that spread out, withering the vegetation and causing destruction everywhere.If it had just been the withering of the grass and the earth being crushed, then it would have been fine. However, there were also many boulders and smaller stones that were split and sent flying out.Due to the earlier collision being so intense that many of the guards could no longer hear, one of them was actually directly shot through the head with one of those flying rock fragments. The terrifying force behind it made the rock shoot straight through his head, causing his corpse to fall silently to the ground.The others all hastily retreated when they saw that. Such a battle was too intimidating. To die like that without even knowing what happened was truly too meaningless.Explosive collisions continued to ring out as one huge broadsword and one huge battle-ax continuously crashed. Sparks shot wildly every time they collided, and even the earth would shake as well.Looking at Wilde who seemed to be possessed by a god of war, a bit of excitement rose in Long Chen\u2019s heart. Wilde had finally started to show off his might.Although this currently still wasn\u2019t his full strength, in any case, at least his sweat and tears in training him weren\u2019t completely wasted.But that was also because they had been lucky enough to run into Wang Mang. If it had been Huang Chang, Wilde probably would not have been able to hold on.Wilde had no fighting experience. Any experiences he had were only from going hunting with Long Chen these few days.Furthermore, Wilde had no idea how to properly attack. Even up until this point, Wilde would only react defensively after seeing his opponent\u2019s attack.If Wilde really did strike, that would completely reveal his fatal weak point. But Wang Mang\u2019s wild series of attacks had actually masked Wilde\u2019s weak points.If it had been Huang Chang, he would definitely have first probed out his opponent\u2019s weak spots before delivering a killing blow.But Wang Mang didn\u2019t have any information on Wilde. Otherwise, no matter how much strength Wilde had, he would probably have been defeated in just a couple of exchanges.Wang Mang was actually provoked to see that Wilde only defended without attacking. In fact, he even became angry, thinking Wilde was playing around with him. His attacks became more and more aggressive.In just the blink of an eye, a dozen exchanges passed. But what surprised Long Chen was that Wilde\u2019s skill with the battle-ax was actually increasing. He no longer seemed like a beginner.When it came to battle-ax techniques or skills, Long Chen had never taught a single one to Wilde. That was because even if he had, it would have been useless. And furthermore, it wasn\u2019t as if Long Chen knew any of them anyways.Wilde seemed to have a kind of innate instinct for battle. As the battle progressed, he could actually automatically comprehend things.It was just like how his body didn\u2019t need to cultivate and would just automatically absorb spiritual qi from the world.Seeing that Wilde was capable of holding his own under Wang Mang\u2019s torrential blows, Long Chen thanked his luck.Wang Mang\u2019s luck truly was terrible. He was actually suppressed by Wilde who didn\u2019t have any fighting experience. His broadsword\u2019s focus was not on skillful techniques, but on using brute force to smash the opponent. Unfortunately, the result was that under Wilde\u2019s might, he was unable to display that kind of power.If it had been a different expert skilled in softer techniques, Wilde would have been quickly defeated. The world truly was marvelous. He had made the right choice to bring Wilde along.Seeing Wilde was temporarily not in any danger, Long Chen didn\u2019t wait any longer. It was time for him to take advantage of the shock Wilde had caused everyone.Looking at the stunned Xia Changfeng, Long Chen shot forward, smashing his fist down.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 Beheading Xia ChangfengPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeXia Changfeng had never imagined that the powerful weapon he had hidden by his side for so long would be held up by some random blockhead.After all, Wang Mang\u2019s combat ability was such that even Huang Chang would be unable to endure ten exchanges from him. But that big blockhead had already blocked over thirty blows and even seemed as if he had the energy to spare. How could that possibly not shock him?Back in the Heroic Assembly House, Wilde had used his full strength to just barely block a single blow from Huang Chang. That was actually something Xia Changfeng had questioned Huang Chang about after.Huang Chang had replied that that blockhead\u2019s power was a bit strange, but it wasn\u2019t anything worth worrying about. He could easily kill him.But that person who Huang Chang had said he could easily kill was actually able to hold back someone who could easily kill Huang Chang!In the midst of his shock, his instincts suddenly gave off a powerful warning, and he punched out without even thinking about it.BOOM!Long Chen\u2019s silent fist was blocked. Xia Changfeng borrowed its power to float back. His guards also now reacted and came to his help, drawing their weapons and charging at Long Chen.Long Chen coldly snorted and formed a hand seal. A sphere of light quickly condensed between his hands. A terrifying temperature came from it that caused space to twist and warp.\u201cQuick, retreat!\u201dSeeing that light, Xia Changfeng\u2019s expression changed completely and he hastily shouted out.But due to their broken eardrums from before, those guards were extremely slow to react. By the time they realized what Xia Changfeng was saying, Long Chen had already completed his preparations.The egg-sized ball of light in his hand shot out, leaving behind a streak of light. Even the air that it shot through became hot enough to cause space to twist.BOOM!That ball of light shot straight into the middle of the group of guards and exploded, enveloping them in a terrifying scarlet blaze.Mournful screams rang out as that terrifying blaze spread to thirty meters, enveloping every single of the guards in its midst.That blaze was precisely Long Chen\u2019s Pill Flame. He had collected all the Pill Flame within his body and sent it out, compressing it to such an extent that it formed a small ball of flame.That flame ball was called a Pill Blaze. Normally, only alchemists who had cultivated to Pill Master were capable of condensing such a Pill Blaze.That was because condensing such a Pill Blaze not only required an extremely powerful Pill Flame, but it also required an extremely powerful Spiritual Strength. That was because condensing it to such a point was extremely dangerous. The slightest slip could cause the flame to explode in your body.Long Chen not only had a powerful beast flame, but the power of his Spiritual Strength went without saying. Most importantly, with the Pill God\u2019s memories in his soul, such usage of his Pill Flame was practically child\u2019s play.Although this was a basic technique for pill cultivators, its power was truly frightful. Once the temperature of the condensed Pill Flame was released, even Blood Condensation experts would be unable to block it.A dozen guards were immediately burnt to a crisp. Pill Flame was not the same as ordinary fire. It was basically inextinguishable. And there were also no pools of water around anyways. Those guards were only able to hold on for at most a couple of breaths\u2019 time before dying. An unpleasant scorched smell filled the air.A dozen of Xia Changfeng\u2019s competent subordinates were lost just like that. His face was ashen and his eyes seemed to spit flames.Long Chen\u2019s face was a bit pale now. That was the full force of his Pill Flame, and the aftermath of such a great consumption was definitely not small, even to him.Those guards were all Xia Changfeng\u2019s elite troops. The majority had all been at the mid Blood Condensation realm or above. Long Chen could only use such a method to quickly defeat them.Although the sacrifice was large and he would no longer be able to use his Pill Flame for a while, it had all been worth it. Now there only remained Xia Changfeng for him to deal with. He didn\u2019t have to worry about other people launching sneak attacks on him.\u201cLong Chen\u2026\u201d Xia Changfeng ground his teeth as he looked at Long Chen.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Long Chen brushed the ashes off his clothes indifferently.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Xia Changfeng\u2019s voice was trembling slightly. The anger inside him had already reached a critical level.\u201cThat\u2019s just what I was going to say,\u201d said Long Chen. \u201cBut before that, I want to know who placed those spiritual seeds in Chu Yao\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cYou want to know? Haha, you\u2019re dreaming!\u201d Xia Changfeng sinisterly said, \u201cDid you really think you could kill me? I\u2019ll let you see just how ridiculous such a thought is!\u201dBOOM! Blood Qi exploded from Xia Changfeng\u2019s body. Powerful fluctuations surged from his body. Qi waves rumbled hundreds of meters away, with Xia Changfeng as the epicenter.\u201cDid you really think I was raised as a spoiled prince without learning any skills? Did you really think you are the only genius under the heavens? Today, I\u2019ll let an idiot like you learn just how stupid you are. The price of this lesson will be your life!\u201dAt this time, Xia Changfeng\u2019s whole aura had exploded out. Shocking qi waves were rolling off his body and his Blood Qi had been condensed to the pinnacle. His pressure made it difficult to breathe.\u201cYou\u2019re at the peak of Blood Condensation?\u201dLong Chen nodded. As he had expected, Xia Changfeng still had hidden cards. No wonder Long Chen had had a somewhat restless feeling throughout the day. He almost felt as if a great catastrophe was about to befall him.A peak Blood Condensation expert was the strongest opponent Long Chen had met up until this date.But no matter what, Long Chen was still willing to pay any price to kill Xia Changfeng. It wasn\u2019t just because Xia Changfeng was extremely likely to be a participant in the schemes against him.The main thing was that he had touched upon the most important thing in Long Chen\u2019s heart. Thinking of Chu Yao who was imprisoned alone within the imperial palace, Long Chen\u2019s killing intent soared.\u201cDie!\u201d Xia Changfeng angrily roared. Stamping on the ground, he charged towards Long Chen. The ground he had stamped upon actually ended up caving into a huge hole.At the same time, a ruthless qi completely locked Long Chen in place. That meant Xia Changfeng was an expert who had tempered himself through life and death battles.Looking at the charging Xia Changfeng, Long Chen tightly clenched his fists. His black hair slowly fluttered in the wind. His eyes were like two sharp blades. The cyclones in his body quickly revolved and he sent a punch out.BANG! A huge explosion rang out. Xia Changfeng stumbled back. He had never thought that the current Long Chen would be even more powerful than when he had killed Huang Chang.His punch just now hadn\u2019t had the slightest effect at all. Long Chen\u2019s leg was already viciously kicking towards his stomach.Xia Changfeng coldly snorted. Pushing down his shock, his right hand became like a blade that ruthlessly slashed down at Long Chen\u2019s leg. With another bang, both of them retreated two steps.Xia Changfeng was greatly shocked. Long Chen was truly a freak. Back in the Heroic Assembly House, he would have been able to slaughter him with just a single hand.But with every time he saw him, Long Chen\u2019s cultivation base would spring up at a shocking pace. Now he could actually fight on par with a peak Blood Condensation expert!This caused him intense fury, but it was also terrifying. If it continued like that, then sooner or later the freak would be someone he could no longer suppress.With an angry howl, Xia Changfeng\u2019s Blood Qi actually completely disappeared as he punched forward. His fist immediately coated with a bloody color. That one punch had actually collected his entire body\u2019s Blood Qi. A bloody smell came from it.\u201cBlood Gathering Fist!\u201dWhen Long Chen saw Xia Changfeng\u2019s punch, he felt his scalp turn numb. That was a fear that came from his innermost being. That terrifying fist definitely possessed a fatal danger to him.He hadn\u2019t expected Xia Changfeng to actually use such a terrifying move so soon. His FengFu Star quickly activated. A stream of spiritual qi flowed from his FengFu Star to his Dantian.The twelve huge cyclones in his Dantian immediately grew sharply and began to revolve even faster. The spiritual qi within three hundred meters of him was immediately absorbed by him. This was the first time he had used his full strength since entering the twelfth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cFlamecloud Palm!\u201dWith a low shout, he also sent a palm out. His flame-covered palm was sent crashing against Xia Changfeng\u2019s fist.BOOM!The ground split apart and rocks shot everywhere. A dozens of meters wide huge crater formed where they collided. Long Chen felt his stomach flip over and over. Vomiting out blood, he was sent flying back.A painful scorching feeling came from his fist. A bloody color had appeared on his hand and was spreading up to his arm.His expression changed and he hastily swallowed an antitoxin pill. Xia Changfeng\u2019s fist had contained blood poison on it. From that one exchange, the poison had invaded Long Chen\u2019s hand.Just now Long Chen had instinctively used the Flamecloud Palm, not the Breaking Wind Fist. Now he couldn\u2019t help but rejoice his gut. Luckily, his instincts truly were formidable.Due to having used the Pill Blaze just now, his flame energy was essentially all used up. The Flamecloud Palm just now had used up the last trace of that flame energy he had managed to recover.But it was precisely because of that trace of flame energy that the majority of the blood poison had been blocked outside his body. If he had instead used the Breaking Wind Fist, his power would have increased a bit, but he would be unable to move at this point.Despite having countered most of the blood poison and also having taken an antitoxin pill, his entire arm was still corroded by the blood poison. A numb and sour feeling came from it.While Long Chen was endlessly shaken, Xia Changfeng was completely angered. Long Chen\u2019s full strength blow had been extremely terrifying. It had actually completely broken his arm.What caused the most fury in him just now would have be the flame energy that had been on Long Chen\u2019s fist. It had actually dispersed most of the blood poison which he had used his entire Blood Qi to condense.A cold light flashed. A long blade appeared in Long Chen\u2019s left hand. A whistling sound rang out as he slashed at Xia Changfeng\u2019s head.Xia Changfeng was surprised, not expecting Long Chen would be unaffected by the blood poison and attack so quickly. Even if he wanted to take a weapon out from his ring, it was already too late.He hastily rolled to the side. The sharp edge of the blade slashed right past Xia Changfeng\u2019s cheek, so close that he could even feel the coldness from it.He had only just managed to dodge one fatal attack when he saw Long Chen slash again at his throat. At this point, there was no retreat. No longer dodging, he sent a kick right towards Long Chen\u2019s Dantian.The Dantian was the location of the cultivation base. If it was damaged, a person would be permanently crippled. This was a strategy of relieving an attack by attacking the core. The attacker would have to give up attacking and switch to defending. It was very simple and effective.But what astounded him was that Long Chen actually seemed to not care about that kick and still kept slashing down.\u201cNO!!!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s craziness had definitely surpassed his expectations! Long Chen would rather become a cripple and kill him than to let go of this opportunity?! It was already too late for him to switch tactics. Endless dread filled him.Long Chen\u2019s eyes were icy cold without the slightest emotion. He was just like a cold-blooded god of slaughter. He didn\u2019t have the slightest misgivings. His blade ruthlessly slashed down.A slicing and banging sound rang out at the same time. Blood flew. A head rolled on the ground while a figure was sent flying away.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 Caught in a CrisisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeXia Changfeng\u2019s kick had contained his full power. Long Chen was sent flying dozens of meters away and then continued rolling on the ground for another dozen meters before stopping.Looking from the fresh blood on his blade to the distant headless corpse that was Xia Changfeng, Long Chen took a deep breath.Xia Changfeng had truly had many hidden trump cards. That last Blood Gathering Fist of his had definitely not been his strongest move. But by taking advantage of his shock, Long Chen had managed to find an opening. He naturally wouldn\u2019t give it up.Long Chen\u2019s cultivation base was not in his Dantian but in his concealed FengFu Star. So that kick hadn\u2019t caused any misgivings for Long Chen. Even if he had to risk his life in exchange, he would still have cut him down.He had always been feeling extremely restless today as if something catastrophic was always about to happen. Now he had an extremely strange feeling in his heart. It was a very vague feeling of danger that seemed to be there and not there. That feeling had been there from the beginning, a kind of indescribable feeling.Just like that, Xia Changfeng had ended up dying. But that kick of his when facing death had still contained his entire cultivation base\u2019s power. When it had landed on Long Chen\u2019s stomach, the terrifying energy within it had caused Long Chen\u2019s blood to wildly surge. His internal organs were greatly shaken and almost burst apart.He hastily swallowed an organ nourishing pill and suppressed his wounds. He thanked his luck for this win. Xia Changfeng had been extremely powerful.If Xia Changfeng had truly used his full strength, it really would have been difficult to say just who would have died. And even if he was defeated, the price would definitely not have been small. It definitely wouldn\u2019t have been as simple as the present. His luck had truly played an important factor.Taking a deep breath, the blood poison on his hand was already being suppressed by medicinal energy and was slowly recovering.All the medicinal pills Long Chen kept on his body were all life-saving pills. They were all higher grade, which allowed for extremely fast recovery. That was the capital a pill cultivator possessed.He walked over to Xia Changfeng\u2019s corpse and took away his spatial ring. However, now still wasn\u2019t the time to examine his harvest.Not even glancing at that glassy-eyed severed head, Long Chen immediately rushed to Wilde\u2019s battlefield.The current Wilde was shouting to his heart\u2019s content. The battle-ax in his hand whistled through the air, and he was becoming more and more valiant as he fought. The battle-ax weaved deftly throughout the air. Although there was no technique, its power was shockingly great.Wang Mang was now using both hands to wield his broadsword as he fought all out against Wilde.It appeared fate had destined Xia Changfeng to die. He had a powerful subordinate like Wang Mang, but because his head had become a bit heated, he was fighting with Wilde using only his brute strength.If he actually used his full repertoire of techniques and skills, he would have easily defeated Wilde. But warriors who had relied purely on strength to fight might simply have incomprehensible minds.With another intense collision, Wang Mang was sent flying back. From the very start, he was unable to withstand the seemingly infinite power of Wilde.Wang Mang was no longer as furious as he was at the beginning. Instead, he was absolutely shocked. He had used his powerful strength to defeat countless powerful enemies. But today his strength had completely failed him, and he was pushed back over and over.As he was staring at Wilde with a complicated expression, he was unaware that another person had appeared behind him. Silently drawing his blade, Long Chen cut it right across his neck.Wang Mang suddenly felt as if he was flying through the air. His first reaction was that he didn\u2019t remember jumping, but when he looked down, he saw that his body was still on the ground just like before. That was his last thought before his mind sunk into darkness.When Wilde saw that Long Chen could behead Wang Mang in a single blow, fear appeared in his eyes.The Mountain Splitting Battle-Ax in his hand fell to the ground.Looking at Wilde\u2019s terrified expression as he looked at Wang Mang\u2019s corpse, Long Chen knew that this reaction was normal, as this was the first time Wilde had seen a person being killed.\u201cWilde, this is cruelty of reality. If we want to continue living, they had to definitely die,\u201d sighed Long Chen.\u201cBrother Long, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Wilde shook his head. \u201cAs long as brother Long believes they must die, they must die.\u201dLong Chen bitterly smiled. Talking sense to Wilde was essentially useless. But Wilde\u2019s trust in him truly did touch him greatly.\u201cWe should leave quickly\u201d But just as Long Chen was about to bring Wilde away\u2026He had always been feeling that something was wrong throughout the entire day. His body suddenly tightened. It was as if he was being stared at by a giant, ancient beast. A powerful aura of death immediately enveloped him, causing him to feel as if he were encased in ice.Slowly turning his head, he saw a person indifferently looking back at him on top of a distant mountain cliff.His pupils immediately shrunk. He finally understood the reason for his fear. It hadn\u2019t been because of Xia Changfeng, but because of that person.That person lightly clapped a couple of times and exclaimed in admiration, \u201cWith just a cultivation base of Qi Condensation, you were able to continuously kill Blood Condensation experts, and one of them was actually at the peak of Blood Condensation. Haha, I have no choice but to admit that you, Long Chen, are truly a genius. You are worthy of being Long Tianxiao\u2019s son.\u201dThat voice was soft and feminine, the voice of Marquis Ying! He was standing high on a cliff, looking down on Long Chen arrogantly. He was just like a leopard stalking his prey.Long Chen\u2019s heart tightened. No wonder he had been continuously feeling as if the catastrophe was just one step away. He had actually caught the attention of Marquis Ying.Obviously, Marquis Ying had long since arrived. He had merely been concealing himself until he had killed Xia Changfeng.\u201cA trap.\u201d Long Chen immediately realized that Marquis Ying had come to kill him.\u201cDid the fourth prince send you here?\u201d Long Chen kicked the broadsword on the ground into his hand. That was Wang Mang\u2019s weapon. Such a heavy weapon gave him a slight sense of security.Marquis Ying was surprised, but immediately indifferently laughed, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dLong Chen shook his head and sighed, \u201cI really was stupid to think I was clever. I actually didn\u2019t realize just how well calculated the fourth prince\u2019s words were.\u201d\u201cWhy are you certain it was the fourth prince who sent me here and not just me coming of my own volition?\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t come here just because of that small matter from last time to take your anger out on me. If you did, then you wouldn\u2019t be Marquis Ying. Waiting patiently is your strongest suit. Otherwise, you would have long since been slaughtered by my father.\u201d Long Chen\u2019s voice was completely steady.Many scenes began to run through his head. From Marquis Ying\u2019s words, he was now certain that the fourth prince wanted him dead.If he assumed that it was the fourth prince who had been abusing the Long family from the start, then he had truly schemed deeply to get him to assassinate Xia Changfeng.First, back at the auction, he had intentionally allowed him to recognize the man who had assassinated Li Hao.That man might be one of the crown prince\u2019s guards on the surface, but he must definitely be one of the fourth prince\u2019s men. He had done this in order to draw Long Chen\u2019s hatred onto the crown prince.And then when he went to visit Chu Yao, he ended up helping him. By telling him that he had investigated the Long family\u2019s matter and acting like he didn\u2019t dare say anything, he had stealthily and vaguely pointed to the hidden enemy being the crown prince.Originally, Long Chen had only half believed him, but then when the fourth prince had brought up the departure of Xia Changfeng and what path he would be taking, he had immediately brought Long Chen\u2019s line of thinking to there.Back then, Long Chen had considered the possibility that he had been planning on borrowing Xia Changfeng to kill him, but for Chu Yao, he was willing to jump in even if it was a trap.If his plan had been for Xia Changfeng to kill him, then the worst case scenario would be for him to flee to the alchemist guild and seek shelter under grandmaster Yun Qi. Then no one would dare attack him.But obviously, the fourth prince wasn\u2019t so stupid, as that would have just made himself his enemy.Now that Marquis Ying had appeared, Long Chen realized he had been thinking too simply back then. He had clearly underestimated the fourth prince\u2019s methods.Long Chen had no choice but to admit that he had been duped. The fourth prince truly was skilled to be able to muddy his thoughts and be able to trick him like this.\u201cLong Chen, looking at the current you, it\u2019s just like I\u2019m looking at a younger Long Tianxiao. You have the same kind of spirit and smarts. Back when I lost to your father, I considered it the greatest disgrace of my life. And even after all these years, I\u2019ve never had a chance to get revenge. But now I\u2019m ready to openly challenge him again. However, before that, I should prepare a gift. What do you think his expression will be like when I give him his son\u2019s head? Haha, I trust that it will definitely be marvelous.\u201d Marquis Ying laughed, but his expression was so sinister it sent shivers down his body.\u201cI think the greatest disgrace of all is that you are considered on the same level of fame as my father. You aren\u2019t sure of beating him, so you actually want to use such an atrocious method. In my father\u2019s eyes, you will forever be a loser. The current you doesn\u2019t even have the qualifications to challenge him.\u201d Long Chen shook his head with pity.Marquis Ying\u2019s indifferent expression finally changed to become incomparably malevolent and sinister. Long Chen\u2019s words had pierced the sole sore point in his heart.Back when he was young, he had been an extremely talented genius with many accomplishments. But unfortunately, he was born at the wrong time. Long Tianxiao was in the same generation as him.He had challenged Long Tianxiao several times, all ending in defeat. In the last fight, he had actually lost a finger to Long Tianxiao.Ever since then, Marquis Ying had begun to bitterly cultivate. He also became more and more dark and feminine. Although he later also advanced to the Tendon Transformation realm to become one of Phoenix Cry\u2019s top three experts, he could never forget the crushing defeats he had suffered to Long Tianxiao.Once he had reached the peak of the mid Tendon Transformation realm, he had suddenly found out that his severed finger had badly damaged him, and he was unable of stepping into the late Tendon Transformation realm. His hatred of Long Tianxiao grew even greater.Now he had coincidentally obtained the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill and had regenerated his finger. That had allowed him to finally break through to the seventh Heavenstage of Tendon Transformation, entering its late stage.That was why the current Marquis Ying was filled with high spirits. He decided that this time he would definitely kill Long Tianxiao, wiping away his shame.But although he had advanced to the late Tendon Transformation realm, Long Tianxiao was his heart-devil, and he was unsure of victory.Luckily, he now had a chance to kill Long Chen. If he used Long Chen\u2019s head to infuriate Long Tianxiao, his chances of victory would definitely rise.Now Long Chen had used just a single sentence to point out his goal, causing him to be enraged out of humiliation. He was just like a hypocrite whose camouflage was torn off by others. Killing intent overflowed from his eyes.\u201cDid I touch on a sore spot? Are you too ashamed to show your face? Then, just crush your head into the cliff and everything will be resolved,\u201d advised Long Chen.Although his words were light, his grip on the broadsword tightened. At the same time, his cyclones slowly revolved and all his nerves were stretched tight.\u201cYou fucking brat, go die!\u201dMarquis Ying angrily roared, and a cold lightning-like light appeared over half the sky. By the time Long Chen sensed anything, he was appalled to find that Marquis Ying had already arrived right in front of him with a sword pressed against his throat.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 Fighting Against Marquis YingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeAlthough Long Chen had long since been on guard against him, he had still never thought that Marquis Ying\u2019s speed was so terrifying. As soon as he just barely moved, he had already arrived in front of him.But he had already prepared himself for this. If Marquis Ying wasn\u2019t strong, how could he possibly be listed alongside his father as one of the empire\u2019s top three experts?Long Chen\u2019s heart was completely calm as he watched the sword slash towards his neck. Any fear was put away. He entered a special kind of state.Not paying the slightest attention to Marquis Ying\u2019s sword, his power exploded as he slashed the broadsword in his hands at Marquis Ying\u2019s waist.The broadsword was exceptionally heavy, but now that he had twelve cyclones, his physical strength had reached an inconceivable level. It was not any problem to Long Chen.Wind whistled. The current Long Chen no longer dared to hold anything back. Slashing with that broadsword with his full strength, even space seemed to be cut apart.Marquis Ying clearly had not expected that Long Chen would be so unafraid of death. This was clearly an attack that would cause both sides to suffer.But despite it being such a basic method, it caused his attack to completely collapse. The sword in his hand was only three feet long, a standard sword length.But Long Chen\u2019s broadsword was seven feet long. If their attacks continued like this, then the result would be that while his sword would manage to slash through Long Chen\u2019s throat, Long Chen\u2019s broadsword would also cut his body apart.No matter how conceited he was, he would never dare use his body to block Long Chen\u2019s broadsword. Even a Tendon Transformation expert like him was unable to do that. He had no choice but to give up his attack. Turning his body, he floated back, dodging the sword by just a fraction of an inch.Although Long Chen seemed as if he was planning on bringing Marquis Ying down even at the cost of his own life, the truth was that he was sure that if he had dodged instead, Marquis Ying would have continued to press his advantage. If he let Marquis Ying attack him consecutively, he would just be quickening his defeat.Seeing Marquis Ying retreat, Long Chen roared, his voice like thunder. His broadsword\u2019s slash suddenly stopped and became a stab straight towards Marquis Ying\u2019s stomach.Marquis Ying had only just dodged when he saw Long Chen suddenly change attacks. His expression couldn\u2019t help but change slightly.After all, that broadsword was heavy to an astonishing level. Marquis Ying had already noticed that, and that was why he didn\u2019t dare take it head-on.But such a shockingly heavy broadsword was controlled so easily by Long Chen. He was even capable of switching attacks in the middle of his movements. That meant Long Chen\u2019s physical strength had already reached a terrifying level.\u201cHmph, it\u2019s just brute force.\u201d Marquis Ying coldly snorted. His sword streaked through the air and heavily stabbed against Long Chen\u2019s broadsword.Sparks shot everywhere. Long Chen was shocked that his full strength attack was pushed to the side by Marquis Ying\u2019s sword, causing his sword to only hit air as it went past Marquis Ying\u2019s body.More importantly, he had used so much force that with the addition of Marquis Ying\u2019s sword stab, Long Chen\u2019s body was also forced forward along with his broadsword.Long Chen had only just realized what a terrible situation he was in when Marquis Ying\u2019s sword shot out as fast as lightning, aiming right for a vital point on his stomach.Relying on his spirit\u2019s battle experience, he instinctively twisted.Marquis Ying\u2019s speed was too quick for him to dodge. His sword stabbed a bloody hole in his stomach.Luckily, Long Chen\u2019s twisting had caused him to miss a vital point. But before Long Chen could even take a breath, Marquis Ying\u2019s second slash was already coming, this time for his throat.Long Chen\u2019s heart was wildly thumping. This was what a Tendon Transformation expert was? There was no way to fight on par with him. In front of Marquis Ying, Long Chen was like a child without the slightest ability to retaliate!The speed of Marquis Ying\u2019s sword was inconceivable. It was already too late for him to dodge. He could only watch with his eyes opened as it approached his throat.Other than the icy-cold sword that was approaching, the only other thing in his eyes was Marquis Ying whose expression was filled with ridicule and resentment. This was the first time Long Chen felt death being so close.\u201cFuck off!\u201dA golden light flew by. Due to the wind revolving around it, a sharp whistling sound rang out as it cut the air apart.Just as Marquis Ying\u2019s sword had been about to pierce Long Chen\u2019s throat, a huge golden ax viciously chopped down at Marquis Ying.Wilde\u2019s reactions had been a bit slow. Seeing the two of them talking and then suddenly start fighting, he hadn\u2019t even reacted until he saw that Long Chen\u2019s life was about to be lost. In a great hurry, he had charged forward, swinging down his ax with his full strength.Marquis Ying had been just about to kill Long Chen. Suddenly feeling his back turn cold and an intense mortal danger, although he was a bit unwilling, he had no choice but to give up his killing attack on Long Chen and swing his sword up to meet Wilde\u2019s battle-ax.Wilde was forced back dozens of meters and looked in shock at Marquis Ying.Marquis Ying also didn\u2019t have an easy time as he was shaken back several meters. His sword blow just now had used a technique to shift the majority of the power away. However, he was still forced back. Even his arm was somewhat numb. He was actually greatly shaken by this. Wilde was practically a Magical Beast in human form.Having his life saved, Long Chen quickly whispered a few things to Wilde, ending with, \u201cWilde, he\u2019s very difficult to deal with. We\u2019ll have to stake our lives.\u201d\u201cStake your lives?\u201d Marquis Ying rubbed his somewhat numb arm and sneered, \u201cWith just your superficial tricks and that brute force? You two might be very powerful compared to others, but in front of a Tendon Transformation expert like me, neither of you have the slightest chance.\u201dLong Chen pointed his sword at Marquis Ying. \u201cWhether or not we have a chance is something we\u2019ll only know after trying.\u201dMarquis Ying didn\u2019t seem to be in a rush to kill them. He stabbed his sword into the ground like a crutch. He began to indifferently speak:\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t see through your cultivation bases, there\u2019s not the slightest trace of Blood Qi coming from your bodies. That means you are both in Qi Condensation.\u201cAs a present I\u2019ll be sending to your father, I\u2019ll do you a favor and tell you just how great the difference is between us.\u201cAt Qi Condensation, you absorb heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi into your own body, allowing you to use heaven and earth\u2019s power for your own. What you cultivate is qi.\u201cAt Blood Condensation, you use heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi to purify your blood. It allows you to strengthen your body. What you cultivate is physical power.\u201cQi and physical strength add together to release a great strength. However, it is only additive.\u201cOnce you reach Tendon Transformation, your body\u2019s physical strength explodes and qi nourishes your soul. Your qi and physical body merge together perfectly.\u201cHowever, at Tendon Transformation, the might produced by qi and body is no longer additive, but multiplicative. If Blood Condensation\u2019s combat level is ten plus ten, then Tendon Transformation\u2019s combat level is ten times ten.\u201dLong Chen\u2019s core was shaken greatly. He knew Marquis Ying wasn\u2019t telling them this information to be nice.He was telling them just how great the difference between them was in order to make them give up and despair.Although he knew that, Long Chen\u2019s heart was still horrified. If what he said was really true, then they really wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.And even ignoring his power, just Marquis Ying\u2019s strange movements and his speed which was fast as lightning were enough to shock him.This was an absolutely hopeless situation. No wonder the fourth prince had dared to scheme against him. Long Chen was to kill Xia Changfeng, and then Marquis Ying would then kill him. It was a truly profound scheme.Wilde obviously wasn\u2019t thinking as much as Long Chen. He only glared straight at Marquis Ying. \u201cBrother Long, what is he saying? Additive and multiplicative? What\u2019s Qi Condensation and Blood Condensation?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother with what he says. Remember what I told you just now,\u201d replied Long Chen quietly.Marquis Ying indifferently looked at Long Chen. \u201cWhat? You really still want to struggle at this point? Do you doubt what I just said?\u201dLong Chen raised his sword at him and sneered, \u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t notice that you\u2019re wearing a photographic jade on your chest? You just want to take a picture of my despair before death for my father, right?\u201dHe had been too nervous before. But now he noticed there was a strange jade on his chest.That jade had many curving lines on it. Although Long Chen had never studied inscription arts, he had heard of photographic jades. The inscriptions on them allowed them to record pictures or even short videos.\u201cHaha, I really never expected to be seen through by you. How boring.\u201d Marquis Ying lightly stroked the jade. \u201cI really did want to send the full image as the gift. First, I\u2019ll send your head to him. Then, I\u2019ll show him the image of your deathbed struggle. Only then can I relieve the hatred I\u2019ve repressed for so many years.\u201dLong Chen laughed, \u201cWhat a shady move. You really are a contemptible little man. A half-man half-woman sissy. You only use these disdainful moves. My father could sever your finger; today I\u2019ll show you that I can sever your head.\u201dHe suddenly stamped his foot. Even the land trembled with him as his shot forward like a wild gale, slashing his sword at Marquis Ying.\u201cHmph, ignorant kid, today I\u2019ll let you see just how terrifying it is when qi merges with your body.\u201dMarquis Ying coldly snorted and his robes began to float without any wind. Green veins began to bulge on his skin like many swimming snakes.That was a specific attribute of the Tendon Transformation realm. When his entire body was covered in green veins, his aura suddenly exploded and terrifying energy shot out everywhere. The space around him was even twisted and warped.Seeing this, Long Chen gritted his teeth. No matter how powerful Marquis Ying was, he had to do his utmost to fight. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have a good death.He was afraid of death. If he really did die, what would happen to his mother? What would happen to Chu Yao? What about his arrangement with Meng Qi? He couldn\u2019t die.Only by going all out and risking his life would there even be the slightest chance of him surviving. His entire energy gathered into the broadsword.Long Chen placed aside his fear and bravely charged into the face of death. Without realizing it, his FengFu Star began to slowly circulate.But after it had only half circulated, it seemed as if some sort of energy was lacking and it returned to calm.\u201cDie!\u201dHe courageously charged forward. His sword shook the heavens as he used his full force to bring it slashing down.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His hand, which was now covered with bulging veins, brandished his sword, causing it to slice through space.BOOM! Terrifying waves of qi surged out violently, causing the entire mountain valley to tremble.Long Chen felt as if he had been smashed by a huge mountain. He was sent tumbling through the air, vomiting out blood.He rolled dozens of meters and spat out another mouthful of blood. His insides felt as if they were on fire. Long Chen\u2019s face was covered with shock and terror.Marquis Ying\u2019s words from before had not just been to frighten him. They had been the truth. When qi and physical power superimposed, the strength that could be unleashed was truly enough to cause a person to despair.\u201cBastard!\u201dWilde let out an angry roar. His ax smashed down right after Long Chen was sent flying. But Marquis Ying\u2019s sword was as quick as lightning, quickly striking against Wilde\u2019s battle-ax.Wilde was sent flying back like a skipping stone, tumbling through the air several times before heavily landing on the ground.But while Wilde was sent back flying further than Long Chen, he didn\u2019t spit out any blood. That surprised Marquis Ying.\u201cNow you two should be convinced. In front of true strength, all your struggles are futile. Give up.\u201d Marquis Ying didn\u2019t chase after them to attack. He stood in his original position like an emperor, coldly looking down on them.Supporting himself with the broadsword to struggle back up, Long Chen shook his head, blood staining his mouth. \u201cGiving up midway isn\u2019t my style. I still haven\u2019t chopped off your head yet either.\u201dMarquis Ying coldly looked back at Long Chen. His anger suddenly turned into laughter. \u201cHaha, you truly are Long Tianxiao\u2019s son. I admire that toughness. I hope once I crush every single bone in your body you can still stay as tough. Kid, go repent in the underworld.\u201dAfter speaking, his body suddenly moved. Long Chen was shocked to realize that he was looking at an afterimage. Marquis Ying\u2019s speed was inconceivable, and he arrived in front of Long Chen in an instant, slashing with his sword.Seeing Marquis Ying\u2019s attack, Long Chen once again didn\u2019t bother with defending, instead also sending a slash out at Marquis Ying.This method of giving up defense to take one\u2019s enemy down as well wasn\u2019t really a method. It was a technique that could only be used when all else was useless.In terms of speed, Long Chen was unable to compare to Marquis Ying. And in terms of power, he was also not his match.All he could rely on was the length of his broadsword. He could only use his courage and boldness to fight against him. Although such a technique was extremely dangerous, it would at least allow him to buy some time.As expected, Marquis Ying was incapable of accepting such an exchange where he would also be heavily injured just to kill him. He recalled his sword to defend, looking for another opportunity to attack.At this time, Wilde also charged over, hacking down with his ax. It seemed that the previous blow hadn\u2019t harmed him at all. His physical body truly was so frighteningly sturdy.Long Chen was gratified to see that Wilde seemed to suddenly become smart. He had learned from Long Chen to ignore Marquis Ying\u2019s sword and attack with his life on the line.Consecutive blows echoed throughout the valley. The very land trembled with each exchange.With Long Chen and Wilde working together and gambling their lives, Marquis Ying was actually unable to display his abilities and was forcibly blocked by the two of them.He had a definite superiority over them in terms of both power and speed. But Long Chen and Wilde\u2019s attacks were absolutely insane, risking their lives over and over again. They didn\u2019t care about any of his blows striking them, only using their bodies to receive his attacks. However, they risked their lives to strike fatal blows on him.Marquis Ying\u2019s face turned green from anger. There were several times when he felt an urge to continue his attack while disregarding their blows in order to kill them, but he still continued to patiently endure.Firstly, Long Chen and Wilde\u2019s strength were too great. If he were to take a direct hit from them, that could be a fatal blow. A slight miscalculation or accident and it wouldn\u2019t be just exchanging blows but exchanging lives.Secondly, he possessed the absolute advantage. Handling Long Chen and Wilde was just a matter of time. There was no need for him to take any reckless risks.And it was precisely because Long Chen had seen through Marquis Ying\u2019s thinking that he dared to do as he did. After all, this kind of exchange was an absolute last resort. If he didn\u2019t risk his life fighting back, he would just die immediately.Weapons clashed and flew. An hour passed in just the blink of an eye. Long Chen was alarmed to realize that his physical strength was starting to fade. The broadsword in his hands began to feel heavier and heavier.And Wilde wasn\u2019t much better off. His ax was no longer as quick and violent as before. He had obviously also reached his limit.Seeing an icy smile appeared on Marquis Ying\u2019s face, Long Chen\u2019s heart grew cold. Marquis Ying was doing this to capture them alive. He would continue to completely exhaust them so that he could torture them as much as he liked later.Long Chen narrowed his eyes. If you want my life, then we\u2019ll have to see if you have the qualifications or not!Marquis Ying smiled inside when he saw that Long Chen and Wilde\u2019s power were weakening and their attacks becoming slower.Suddenly, Long Chen swung his broadsword too hard. Due to a lack of energy, he stumbled forward a step along with the sword. That one step immediately revealed a huge opening.Almost by reflex, Marquis Ying didn\u2019t even think. Dodging Wilde\u2019s ax, his sword directly slashed towards Long Chen\u2019s waist. Obviously, Long Chen\u2019s guess was right; Marquis Ying was planning on keeping them barely alive. Otherwise, that sword would be going straight for his heart.A cold glimmer shined in Long Chen\u2019s eyes. Suddenly, his FengFu Star was activated to its full power. All his power flowed straight into his Dantian.The twelve cyclones that were already three hundred meters wide immediately grew to ten times the size. They quickly revolved, and the spiritual qi within fifty kilometers was immediately sucked dry.\u201cWhether I can succeed or not, I have to try!\u201dLong Chen prayed inside. His twelve cyclones all revolved, causing all that spiritual qi to condense into a cord that flowed through the LiYao point, merged into the HuiMing Point, and at the end rushed through the QuChi point to enter the LaoGong point.When his spiritual qi flowed into the first point, that acupuncture point acted like a flood gate that was forced open. After his spiritual qi went through that gate, it somehow began to flow faster, rushing into the next point with an even greater force.Once the spiritual qi had finished through all the layers of superposition and entered the final LaoGong point in his hand, Long Chen suddenly felt intense pain coming from that acupuncture point.\u201cCrap, my meridians can\u2019t handle this.\u201dAs soon as he felt that pain around his LaoGong point, he realized the surrounding meridians were also starting to shudder, unable to handle the rushing of the spiritual qi.\u201cHOLD FOR ME!\u201d Long Chen angrily roared. He could no longer care too much about that. He controlled it so only a strand of that energy flowed out of the LaoGong point.Without even thinking about it, he injected that strand of energy into his broadsword. The broadsword immediately began to shake and rumble.Just as Marquis Ying\u2019s sword was about to pierce into Long Chen\u2019s waist, he suddenly felt his heart jump and all his hair stood on end. Relying on his many years of battle experience, he instinctively gave up on his attack and hastily retreated.But even as he began to retreat, the broadsword in Long Chen\u2019s hand was already raised. The seven-foot-long broadsword emitted a strange light and seemed to possess an aura of endless death as it descended upon Marquis Ying.\u201cSplit the Heavens!\u201dMarquis Ying was completely terrified as he looked up at that sword. That sword had somehow managed to lock him in place.A small Qi Condensation beginner was actually able to use his qi to lock a Tendon Transformation expert two realms above him in place. That was absolutely crazy!Normally, such a lock could only occur when the stronger expert attacked the weaker one. If two opponents were on the same level, it was extremely difficult for one to lock the other in place. For an insignificant Qi Condensation newbie to lock down a Tendon Transformation expert was a joke!However, such a thing actually now happened to Marquis Ying. But Marquis Ying quickly recovered from his shock, sensing the scent of death drawing near him.The sword in Long Chen\u2019s hand held a strange shine. It was just like a divinity\u2019s blade, mercilessly slashing down.\u201cWave Breaking Slash!\u201d Seeing that sword slash down, Marquis Ying shouted. Now was not the time to be shocked by Long Chen\u2019s lock. All the green veins on his body sharply grew until it was like vines which were wriggling right under his skin. His aura once more grew to a new level as he also slashed out.Qi waves surged out dozens of meters. This Wave Breaking Slash was one of Marquis Ying\u2019s ultimate techniques, and it was an Earth class Battle Skill.BOOM!The moment Long Chen\u2019s broadsword met Marquis Ying\u2019s sword, heaven and earth both turned still for a moment. Only then did an enormous explosion ring out.Three figures were sent flying at the same time. The terrifying energy completely destroyed their original battlefield. A huge crater almost thirty meters wide appeared where they had collided.Long Chen felt as if his entire body were about to fall apart from exhaustion. His right hand was hurting in particular. According to common sense, with his current meridian widths, he was still unable to display Split the Heavens.But despite that, he had forcibly used it just now. This had completely broken down his meridians surrounding the LaoGong point. But he had also finally learned just how terrifying Split the Heavens was.He had actually been lucky at that final moment, as he had only used a strand of Split the Heaven\u2019s energy. He hadn\u2019t dared to use the rest of that energy.If he had used the full force of that Battle Skill, perhaps all his meridians would have completely been blown apart and he would truly become a cripple. But despite using just a strand of that energy, his hand\u2019s meridians were completely ravaged.Other than a lingering fear, Long Chen also felt a burst of excitement. It was already so powerful despite that he had only used just a strand of its power. Just what class of Battle Skill had Split the Heavens reached?\u201cYou really are worthy of being Long Tianxiao\u2019s son. Good, very good, hahahaha!\u201dA burst of laughter rang out. The dust slowly scattered and Marquis Ying appeared from within.But the current Marquis Ying appeared extremely miserable. His clean and tidy clothes had become unbearably tattered. There was a large wound in the middle of his stomach from which blood slowly flowed out.Of the sword in his hand, only the hilt remained now. That exchange just now had completely destroyed the blade.Long Chen\u2019s pupils shrunk. Although Marquis Ying was extremely destitute now, his aura hadn\u2019t dropped much at all. That meant Marquis Ying combat ability hadn\u2019t dropped either.Using one hand, he tore off his tattered clothes, revealing his wound and also a soft armor.That armor was golden in color. It appeared extremely flexible and strong, however, a large hole had been split open on it due to Long Chen\u2019s broadsword.\u201cWhat a powerful Battle Skill. If I hadn\u2019t had this golden silk armor, I really would have died.\u201d Looking down at his wound, Marquis Ying icily said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance. If you hand over that Battle Skill, I\u2019ll give you two a quick death.\u201dLong Chen switched the broadsword into his left hand. His right hand was already half-crippled and was unable to hold it anymore. He forced himself up and coldly laughed, \u201cAnd what if I say no?\u201d\u201cLong Chen, you better think this through. Death isn\u2019t scary. Living a life worse than death is the most painful. And I just happen to have some skill in that area. I\u2019d advise you not to regret anything,\u201d said Marquis Ying icily.\u201cI, Long Chen, have never done anything I\u2019ve regretted.\u201d Long Chen glanced at him and then stealthily cast a meaningful glance at Wilde.Long Chen didn\u2019t dare be too obvious. After glancing at Wilde, Long Chen slowly raised his sword and sneered, \u201cYing Zhao, that move just now was just a testing blow. Now that I\u2019ve tested it\u2026 I\u2019ll take your dogsheet life!\u201dAfter saying that, he stabbed the sword into the ground. At the same time, waves of qi exploded out and raised up all the dust into the air.\u201cHmph, just let me see how capable you are,\u201d Marquis Ying grimly laughed. Rubbing his ring, another sword appeared in his hand, and he raised it in front of him.But when the dust settled, the guarded Marquis Ying realized that Long Chen had already disappeared, only leaving behind the foolish Wilde standing there.Marquis Ying\u2019s expression changed.

    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 Pursuit Deep in the ForestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeMarquis Ying\u2019s expression changed and he hastily looked up, only to see that Long Chen had already fled hundreds of meters deeper into the mountains.\u201cFuck!\u201dFor the reserved and elegant Marquis Ying, that was the first time he had shouted out such a vulgar word. His eyes were spitting flames; he had been fooled!So the truth was that Long Chen had noticed that his full strength attack was actually not enough to incapacitate him and that he was simply not a match for a Tendon Transformation expert!After saying a couple of ruthless words, he had stabbed his sword into the ground to fill the air with dust and then immediately fled. Perhaps fleeing was actually the most valuable combat skill to have.However, when Long Chen noticed that Wilde hadn\u2019t fled with him and was instead just foolishly standing in his original spot, he almost coughed up blood in anger.He had purposely given him a glance just now to tell him that there would be a chance to flee. He hadn\u2019t expected him to not react and just stand there.But since he had already fled now, he absolutely could not return. Marquis Ying\u2019s target was him. As long as he fled, Wilde should be safe.As he expected, he had only gone several hundred meters before Marquis Ying angrily roared and started charging after him.\u201cStop!\u201dSuddenly, Wilde angrily roared and a red light started to come from his skin. Violent energy soared from his body. He was just like a wild ancient beast that had been awakened.Just as Marquis Ying was about to chase after Long Chen, a huge battle-ax whistled over at him, causing his heart to tremble.What surprised him was that Wilde\u2019s attack was suddenly much stronger than before. Even before the ax landed, just the wind from it alone was enough to make it hard for him to breath. The power behind his attack had at least doubled.BOOM!Marquis Ying didn\u2019t take it head-on. The new sword in his hand wasn\u2019t an equal to his old sword, so he didn\u2019t dare meet that blow. The result was that Wilde\u2019s ax ruthlessly smashed into the ground.His terrifying energy caused the whole valley to shake. Broken rocks shot out everywhere and a shockingly huge crater appeared.\u201cBrother Long, quickly run! I\u2019ll block him!\u201dSeeing his attack missed, he once more sent his ax smashing at Marquis Ying.The fleeing Long Chen was both shocked, angered, and moved. He was shocked that Wilde would be able to explode with such terrifying strength.He was furious because there was no point in blocking him! Long Chen wanted Marquis Ying to chase after him!He was also moved that Wilde would actually use his own life to try to protect him. Although Wilde was a bit naive, maybe even flat-out dumb, he had complete and total trust in Long Chen. He was even willing to give up his own life for him.Long Chen had an urge to both cry and curse. He was extremely worried, but he also didn\u2019t dare to stop running. That would simply be telling Marquis Ying that he wouldn\u2019t abandon Wilde, thus, revealing his weak spot. Then, both of them would die.Originally, he had been planning on drawing away Marquis Ying and having Wilde flee in a different direction. But the result was that Wilde hadn\u2019t understood the slightest bit of Long Chen\u2019s intentions.BOOM!Marquis Ying dodged Wilde three more times. At this time, Wilde\u2019s strength was growing stupendously. That last attack had been so powerful that he hadn\u2019t been able to dodge. Blocking with his sword, he was forced back five steps.\u201cDie!\u201dMarquis Ying raged. Today, he had been repeatedly thwarted from killing Long Chen. A grand Tendon Transformation expert like him had actually been this helpless in front of two insignificant Qi Condensation rookies.More importantly, Long Chen\u2019s final attack just now had given him a somewhat heavy internal injury. Although he made himself appear fine, the truth was that he was merely suppressing the injury.That was why he didn\u2019t want to use any of his power to get past Wilde who was blocking him. That would end up making his internal injury worse. But he was becoming increasingly anxious as he saw Long Chen flee further and further away.If he couldn\u2019t throw off this giant fellow, then Long Chen really would escape. That was something completely unacceptable. His veins bulged again as he also sent a slash out at Wilde\u2019s attack.Wilde suddenly felt an unstoppable force push him back. He only managed to stabilize himself after almost ten meters. Although Marquis Ying didn\u2019t specialize in power, the sharp increase in strength after entering the Tendon Transformation realm was simply too great.He managed to force Wilde back, but Marquis Ying also wasn\u2019t well off. His stomach was aching dully. That was the result of provoking his internal injury.Long Chen\u2019s last attack had not only shaken his internal organs, but even his Dantian had been somewhat jolted. That led to his spiritual qi being much more sluggish.In the process of forcing Wilde back, he had almost been unable to continue suppressing his injury. Immediately after forcing Wilde back, he went to go chase after Long Chen. Long Chen was his main target.\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere!\u201dMarquis Ying almost went mad with rage. Wilde actually hadn\u2019t even received an injury despite being blown back and was now charging at him again.Wilde truly was a Magical Beast in human form. His physical body had reached an absolutely frightening level. Just by relying on his physical strength, he had actually managed to forcefully take a Tendon Transformation expert\u2019s attack.Being unable to throw off Wilde, Marquis Ying\u2019s eyes turned icy cold and he once more used his sword to block Wilde\u2019s battle-ax. He then snaked his sword through an opening to stab at Wilde\u2019s stomach.Marquis Ying had obviously been infuriated and was willing to kill to get away from this hindrance. But when his sword struck Wilde\u2019s skin, it was as if he had struck a hard surface. His sword slipped and his full strength blow immediately lost over half its power.The sword still managed to pierce through Wilde\u2019s skin. However, it only managed to get two inches in before being unable to go any further. It was unable to pierce through Wilde\u2019s bones.Marquis Ying was greatly shocked, as that was the first time such a thing had happened. Even a Magical Beast\u2019s body would be easily pierced through with his cultivation base. But he was apparently unable to do the same to Wilde.\u201cROAR!\u201dWilde didn\u2019t even seem to notice the wound, viciously smashing down his battle-ax on Marquis Ying.He had attacked Wilde twice now without being able to give Wilde a true injury. And now that Wilde was attacking him, he was held back from chasing after Long Chen again.At this time, he glanced into the distance and couldn\u2019t help being worried. Long Chen had already fled over five miles. He was just about to enter a thick forest.If he really did enter that forest, then by relying on the coverage, he would have an unacceptably high chance of getting away.But Wilde continued to firmly block his way. Grinding his teeth, he raised his sword with both hands and a scarlet flame color appeared over it.\u201cCliff Breaking Slash!\u201dWilde\u2019s battle-ax went flying away while he himself was sent tumbling back dozens of meters. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and at the same time, the strange red light from his body faded. His aura sharply fell.Marquis Ying had actually been so pressed for time that he had used an Earth class Battle Skill. He had managed to send Wilde flying, but Wilde only spat out a single mouthful of blood. On the other hand, that one attack caused his internal injury to almost flare out of control.He hastily took out a healing pill from his ring. That was a precious high grade healing pill that he had collected many years ago.For his cultivation base, middle grade or lower medicinal pills were basically without any effect, while high grade medicinal pills were extremely rare. So swallowing that medicinal pill now truly caused him a heartache.Marquis Ying glanced at Wilde who was lying on the ground and hesitated for a moment. He really wanted to kill Wilde, as he was practically a monster. He would definitely be terrifying once he matured.But then looking at Long Chen who was on the eve of hiding in the forest, Marquis Ying gritted his teeth. Weighing his options, he still decided to ignore Wilde and chased directly after Long Chen.Wilde was extremely worried when he saw Marquis Ying go straight after Long Chen. He crawled back up to give chase as well.But he only managed to take two steps before he felt the world spinning around him.Wilde fell on his butt. His face was completely pale, and he couldn\u2019t stop his hands from shivering. That was a sign that he had overdrafted his strength.Hatefully punching the ground, he could only watch as Marquis Ying\u2019s figure faded deep into the valley.\u2026Long Chen had kept a watch over their battle as he had fled. Seeing Wilde unwaveringly blocked Marquis Ying had caused him to panic.If Wilde really did enrage Marquis Ying, then he might not take Long Chen into consideration and just kill Wilde. If that happened, Long Chen would regret it for a lifetime.But according to his understanding of Marquis Ying, he wasn\u2019t the type of person to lose his cool because of anger.When he was just about to enter the forest, he saw Marquis Ying ignore Wilde to chase after him, causing him to finally feel some reliefs. He then focused his full strength on running.Entering the forest, everything suddenly became quiet. Countless huge trees reached for the sky, making it so that it was extremely difficult for any sunlight to get through.Long Chen quickly adapted to the lighting and charged forward, doing his best not to step on any vegetation.Doing so would leave behind obvious tracks. Long Chen instead did his best to land on rocks or perhaps overturned trees. That way Marquis Ying would not find his trail and would require a great deal of time to search for him. Then his advantage would become much more obvious.The most important part of this chase would be this beginning part. He was rushing forward as quickly as possible. Once Marquis Ying entered the forest though, he would have to become completely silent and not move at all in the beginning. Otherwise, Marquis Ying would manage to find his position through sound.Long Chen\u2019s only advantage over him was that he was a pill cultivator. His soul was exceptionally strong and able to sense his opponent from a large distance. He wouldn\u2019t be able to get a perfect view of him from this distance, but he would still be able to sense Marquis Ying\u2019s relative position.Once Long Chen had fled over five miles, he suddenly stopped and even suppressed his own breathing, not moving at all. That was because he had sensed that Marquis Ying had just entered the forest.Long Chen also closed his eyes and let himself enter an empty spirit state, making it so that he seemed like just another rock in the forest, completely isolating his aura.Having entered this state, he could \u2018see\u2019 Marquis Ying who had just entered the forest. As he had expected, he immediately paused and listened closely for Long Chen.Marquis Ying waited for over the time it took for an incense stick to burn, but was unable to hear any breathing. Having just entered the forest, everything was completely silent, silent to a frightening degree.But after a quarter hour had passed, the birds and insects began to play their own music, causing the forest to become bustling with noise.Those bird calls caused Marquis Ying\u2019s expression to become increasingly ugly. He hadn\u2019t expected Long Chen to be so crafty. He actually knew to use such a method to hide his trail.Long Chen smiled. It seemed his chances of fleeing successfully had increased again.Although the two of them were only separated by around five miles, while hidden deep in this forest, such a distance was already extremely safe. And with the passing of time, he would only become even more at ease.Two hours.Four hours.Six hours later, Marquis Ying finally gave up and began to search for his trail by eye.Following Marquis Ying\u2019s search, the entire forest began to once more turn quiet. Long Chen also finally opened his closed eyes.\u201cHehe, Marquis Ying, even if I can\u2019t beat you, I still have to properly play with you.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 Long Chens GiftPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeSeeing Marquis Ying begin to move, Long Chen didn\u2019t wait around stupidly. He began to slowly sneak deeper into the forest.Long Chen didn\u2019t flee at a fast speed, as he needed to be extremely careful. He did his best not to leave any signs of his trail.He also couldn\u2019t make any noise. Otherwise, Marquis Ying would definitely notice, and all his efforts would have been wasted.So, Long Chen\u2019s fleeing speed was not that much different from Marquis Ying\u2019s searching speed. Furthermore, Long Chen couldn\u2019t flee in just one direction. If Marquis Ying decided to just rush straight forward upon seeing such a trail, he would be screwed.After all, this wasn\u2019t an ordinary game of hide-and-seek. Losing meant death. This was the first time Long Chen had ever felt so nervous. It was as if the Grim Reaper\u2019s sickle was constantly pressed right against his throat. Just the slightest carelessness could lead to his head tumbling into the ground.\u201cI\u2019ve found you, Long Chen! Prepare to die!\u201d Marquis Ying suddenly shouted out and rushed forward. Long Chen was extremely startled, but he then coldly smiled.His current position was around two miles away from Marquis Ying. That wasn\u2019t because Marquis Ying was moving faster than Long Chen, but because Long Chen needed to travel in a zigzag. So in a sense, the distance between them was still over five miles.Marquis Ying was obviously lying. Suddenly jumping like that, an ordinary youth might be scared and start fleeing as fast as he could. That was the real trap.But Long Chen just quietly hid under a huge tree, appreciating the play that this peak Phoenix Cry expert was putting on for him.Although, he didn\u2019t dare \u2018watch\u2019 with his eyes. Ever since the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s auction when Marquis Ying had sensed him looking at him even through a wall, Long Chen had learned just how frighteningly perceptive the senses of experts were.Marquis Ying tried his bluff several more times without the slightest bit of success. In the end, he had no choice but to return to his original location and continue searching for traces of Long Chen\u2019s trail.After all, no matter how careful Long Chen was, he was unable to fly. The ground, the grass, the rocks, and the trees would all leave behind some sort of trail.But due to how smart Long Chen had acted, his tracks were difficult to find and required him to search for a long time. That greatly reduced Marquis Ying\u2019s speed and was also mentally taxing.Long Chen was actually conserving much more energy than Marquis Ying, causing Marquis Ying to become increasingly infuriated.\u201cLong Chen, just wait for when I catch you. I\u2019ll skin you and pull out each and every single strand of your muscles while you still live before turning your bones to ashes!\u201d Marquis Ying ground his teeth.He knew Long Chen was somewhere in the area and could hear him. He could even sense that Long Chen was hiding in a corner and laughing secretly at him. That made him even more infuriated.A grand Tendon Transformation expert like him, one of the three apex experts of Phoenix Cry, was actually unable to kill a small Qi Condensation brat. If that information got out, then he would immediately become the entire empire\u2019s laughingstock.He had a stomach full of anger without anywhere to release it. But he had to maintain his calm, otherwise, with the slightest negligence, Long Chen might really be able to flee from him. He could only continue to search and follow his trail, while also keeping an ear on the surrounding silence.Long Chen sneered. \u201cYou want to skin me? Such a dream isn\u2019t as easy to achieve as you think.\u201dSeeing Marquis Ying begin slowly searching, Long Chen continued going deeper into the forest. That was the best option.It was true that it might be possible for him to detour around Marquis Ying and stealthily return to the valley and then the capital. And such an option was definitely tempting to him.But Long Chen had decided to give up on that thought for now. From his understanding of Marquis Ying, he knew that he would have set up many traps before coming here. If he rashly went out the forest, that might just be walking right into his trap.Moreover, his internal injuries were extremely severe. His right hand\u2019s meridians had been completely destroyed. He had perhaps just a tenth of his regular fighting ability. Just a few random Blood Condensation subordinates possessed a fatal danger to him.So he had no choice but to suppress his desire to return to the capital. He continued deeper into the forest, carefully traveling in a zigzag manner so that he could easily misguide Marquis Ying, forcing him to travel even slower.After another four hours, the sky darkened. The entire forest became much gloomier and frightening. Occasionally, the howls of ferocious beasts rang out.Long Chen\u2019s expression sunk; if his luck was bad and he ended up being noticed by one of those beasts, although he wouldn\u2019t be killed by the beast, he would likely end up attracting Marquis Ying over.Now that night had already arrived, many beasts had begun to come out of their lairs. Those beasts didn\u2019t know how difficult Long Chen would be to deal with. If they happened to consider him as food to prey on, that would be troublesome.Long Chen was hiding behind a stone rampart. Suddenly, he heard some light sounds coming over, and sweeping his divine sense over, he felt a huge headache.At this time, it was so dark that he couldn\u2019t even see his own fingers even if he held his hand right over his eyes. However, his Spiritual Strength could substitute for his eyes to \u2018see\u2019 everything within dozens of meters of him extremely clearly.In front of him was a wolf around a meter tall. That one-meter wolf was essentially a cub.Long Chen cursed his bad luck. Although this was just a wild beast and not a Magical Beast, if that cub ended up attacking him, even if he did manage to kill it in one blow, it would still cause a bit of noise.In this silent forest, such a noise was something that Marquis Ying, with his Tendon Transformation cultivation base, could not possibly miss. Especially not while he was quietly searching for his trail.Long Chen slowly took out a dagger from his ring. If that hungry wolf did end up coming at him, he had to kill it in one shot. But he had absolutely no confidence in being able to kill it without making the slightest noise.If it ended up letting out a miserable howl as it died, then it would be over for him. Man and wolf looked right at each other. Long Chen felt his sweat begin to drip.This face to face examination continued for several breaths when the wolf\u2019s nose suddenly sniffed slightly. It actually withdrew and disappeared into the night.Long Chen was extremely puzzled when he suddenly remembered Little Snow. Having been in contact with that little fellow for so long, had some of his Magical Beast smell rubbed off on him and scared away the wolf?\u201cWait, crap, Little Snow is still in the valley!\u201dHe clapped himself in the forehead. He had actually forgotten about Little Snow in his panic. Before going to kill Xia Changfeng, he had hidden Little Snow inside a cave.But the situation had changed greatly from what he had imagined. Marquis Ying\u2019s appearance had forced Long Chen and Wilde to fight against him with all they had, yet in the end, they were unable to defeat him. Long Chen had fled into the forest to draw Marquis Ying away.Now that he suddenly thought of Little Snow, Long Chen prayed that Wilde would for once be smart and remember to bring Little Snow away.The current Little Snow had eaten quite a bit of meat after being with Long Chen. He had already grown from being the size of a palm to being over a foot long. But that was still too small for him to survive on his own.Thinking of that adorable fellow, Long Chen actually had an urge to go back to the valley. But that was not a viable option. He was almost certain that Marquis Ying had set up other killers waiting for him around there.Long Chen\u2019s hatred of Marquis Ying grew even greater now; however, he was also helpless. Seeing that wolf retreat, Long Chen hastily moved a couple of rocks over to completely hide himself. He would conceal his body and aura, which would allow him to avoid most of the beasts.Suddenly, he heard distant roars. Long Chen smiled. Hehe, it seemed Marquis Ying truly was popular.Long Chen didn\u2019t dare kill that wolf because he was afraid of drawing over Marquis Ying. Moreover, the death of such a beast would release a strong scent of blood that would attract countless predators.Those predators were the masters of this area. They were all able to easily smell blood within five miles.Not long after the first roar, other beasts had also come. Long Chen could even hear the sound of a blade slashing through the air.\u201cHehe, excellent. You just stay busy for now. I\u2019ll recover for a bit.\u201dHaving hidden himself behind a stone rampart, he was extremely difficult to find. Now with Marquis Ying having to fend off all the vicious beasts that were gathering around him, he felt even safer.He consumed two medicinal pills. One was to heal his inner wounds, while the other was to heal his meridians.As a pill cultivator, Long Chen naturally had prepared countless medicinal pills for himself. Now they finally had some use. Moreover, the medicinal pills, which he had reserved for his own use, were extremely extravagant; they were all high grade medicinal pills.Ever since obtaining the beast flame at the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival, his flame\u2019s strength had increased so much that Long Chen had completely replaced all of his middle grade medicinal pills.Now that he had consumed those two medicinal pills, he no longer had to be as worried about his inner wounds. As long as he had enough time, they would slowly recover.But the injury to his hand\u2019s meridians was somewhat troublesome. Meridians spread throughout the entire body, reaching every inch of his body.It was precisely because of those canal-like meridians that spiritual qi could be sent anywhere in the body to release powerful strength.If an ordinary person\u2019s meridians were destroyed, that person would essentially become a cripple. But Long Chen had his Pill God\u2019s memories, so although this matter was a bit troublesome, it wasn\u2019t a huge obstacle. It just required some time to fix.Long Chen focused his medicinal pills\u2019 energy onto the endpoint of his wrist where the meridians had been damaged. Using Spiritual Strength and medicinal energy, he let the meridians regenerate.Letting meridians regenerate was an incredibly difficult process. In principle it was simple. It was just allowing broken canals to once more grow along their old routes.But the difficulty was actually incredibly great. In the entire Phoenix Cry Empire, even including grandmaster Yun Qi, there was no one other than Long Chen who could do so.Grandmaster Yun Qi could perhaps recover the finger\u2019s meridians because those were main meridians that many people remembered.But as for those extremely thin meridians that were no wider than a hair, those were something he was definitely incapable of healing. And even if he did manage to mold those meridians out with his experience, they would be completely different from the old ones.Long Chen\u2019s method was not the same. He was letting the meridians once more grow out extremely naturally, letting them follow their own paths that they remembered.Such a process was exceptionally slow, but to Long Chen, each millimeter they grew was another increase in his chances of survival.Long Chen focused his entire attention on recovering from his wounds. The entire night passed as he worked, and he only opened his eyes when it was daytime once more.Quietly opening the stone shelter he had built, he looked over in the direction where all those beast roars had come from and his stomach suddenly grumbled.Long Chen\u2019s eyes brightened and he suddenly smiled mischievously. Marquis Ying, this master is going to prepare a little gift for you.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 Sending a LumpPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeDeep within the dense forest, Marquis Ying was looking down at Long Chen\u2019s tracks. His expression was so dark that it was frightening. That was because he had realized Long Chen was extremely crafty. Sometimes he would purposely leave footprints to mislead him.He would follow those footprints and find that any trace of Long Chen completely disappeared after a while. With his tracks completely disappearing, it meant that Long Chen must have backtracked into a previous location and once more fled in a different direction.These footprints were purposely a bit more clear to intentionally let Marquis Ying see them. Now he would have to go back and spend even more time searching for where Long Chen had split off into a different direction.Marquis Ying was completely infuriated. Long Chen was too cunning. Sometimes, the footprints he left behind intentionally would actually be the direction he went, so Marquis Ying couldn\u2019t even rule that out.In order to tell his true direction, Marquis Ying had no choice but to patiently follow along slowly. He could sense Long Chen wasn\u2019t that far, but he was unable to find him. He was so angry that his lungs felt like they were about to explode.A whole day had already passed since they had entered the forest. Marquis Ying was starting to get impatient. However, he also had no way around this. He could only continue searching for his tracks.In this manner, the two of them continued playing hide-and-seek in the endless forest. Although Long Chen had a slight advantage at this time, he didn\u2019t dare to be the slightest bit overconfident.If Long Chen wanted to, he would actually able to quickly break away from Marquis Ying\u2019s pursuit. However, he refused to do that. He only continued to keep Marquis Ying at a distance of five miles.That was the perfect distance from which a Tendon Transformation expert could sense an enemy in the vicinity, but would be unable to pinpoint that enemy\u2019s location. This was done intentionally by Long Chen.After sending Long Chen to kill Xia Changfeng, the fourth prince had sent Marquis Ying to kill him. This meant the fourth prince was no longer worried about his father.In other words, the entire Long household was in danger. He had to continue this in order to stall Marquis Ying. One reason for this stalling was that as long as Wilde was doing what he had told him, he would quickly return to the capital.Wilde would bring his household\u2019s people to the alchemist guild. With his relationship to grandmaster Yun Qi, he would definitely not ignore them. At that time, even the fourth prince would have to reconsider whether he should make any moves against them.The other reason was that if Marquis Ying continued not to return to the capital, the fourth prince who hadn\u2019t received a report of his death would definitely not attack the Long household.That was why Long Chen continued to risk his life to hold Marquis Ying up. It was also why he had no other options. He had to do this.He carefully continued advancing. Long Chen suddenly saw a huge tree with a fist-sized beetle on it.Seeing that beetle, Long Chen\u2019s eyes brightened. He recognized that beetle as the \u2018horned bull beetle\u2019. That was because it had a horn on its nose that was just like a bull\u2019s horn.This was a very mildly tempered beetle. Its movements were especially slow. But it shouldn\u2019t be underestimated for being small. Its strength was actually shocking.Just such a small beetle was capable of moving ten to twenty pounds. He smiled, \u201cHehe, little guy, help me out a bit.\u201dIgnoring its outrage, Long Chen picked up the little beetle and placed it into his robes. Once more advancing another mile, he found a good location and stopped.He took out a thin thread from his spatial ring. That was black silk, and despite its thinness, it was extremely sturdy. Just one thread of it could withstand half a ton of force. Most adventurers would also keep a bit of it on hand.Whether it was to use as a rope or to make a snare, it was extremely convenient. The most popular thing about it was that it was made from black silkworms that were raised by humans, so it could be bought cheaply.Long Chen looked around and nodded in approval. The black silk\u2019s color was not easy to notice against the background.He found a short bush around the size of an egg and gently pushed on it, feeling a good elasticity. He lightly twined the black silk around the bush.By tying it back with the black silk, the bush was just like an arm ready to pitch. Once it lost the force of the black silk, it would immediately shoot forward.Long Chen did all of this extremely carefully. The slightest mistake might make a large enough noise to attract Marquis Ying.But thinking about the result of this trap if it worked, this little danger was definitely worth it.He finished setting up his \u2018slingshot\u2019. Looking around the vicinity, he saw both sides were covered by thorny thistles and there was only one straight path through this area.While people were rushing, they would naturally choose the easiest path. So this was the ideal spot to place the trigger.Putting up several obstacles around his slingshot to protect it, he confirmed the distance. No matter how Marquis Ying arrived, he would definitely step upon a certain root.He took out the horned beetle and bound one of its legs with the black silk. Placing it on top of a large tree, the beetle began to slowly crawl, but it wasn\u2019t randomly crawling around. It was crawling up to a spot ten meters up on the tree.That was because Long Chen had placed a petal from a Butterfly Orchid there. That was a kind of medicinal ingredient. That petal contained a very rich sweetness.It was also the favorite food of the horned bull beetle. Although that petal was half withered, with the beetle\u2019s amazing sense of smell, it immediately noticed it and began to crawl over to it with all its might.Its speed was extremely slow though. It only managed to reach there after the time it took for an incense stick to burn.But just as it was preparing to eat its favorite food, Long Chen picked up the pitiful fellow and pulled it away.Long Chen made some calculations and tied a knot over the beetle, keeping it in place. That knot had a small loop in it. If that loop was touched, then the knot would immediately loosen, releasing it.After carefully setting up all these preparations, he placed a small stone on the other side of the black silk. He confirmed everything was set.Once the beetle crawled up to the Butterfly Orchid\u2019s petal, it would activate and release the knot, causing the stone to fall to the ground.Long Chen once more looked over his trap from start to end. A strange smile appeared on his face. He found a large leaf and then sneakily hid behind a large tree.He watched for a moment as the beetle continued according to its original route, crawling towards the petal. But due to it now pulling along a stone, its speed had slowed down a bit.Long Chen nodded and quietly retreated. Now there was only one tiny crucial item remaining. As for whether the trap would succeed, that would depend on Marquis Ying. He stealthily disappeared deeper into the forest.An hour later, Marquis Ying, who was searching for any of Long Chen\u2019s tracks, suddenly heard a strange sound, the sound of a stone rolling.That sound was extremely quiet, but within the keen listening ears of Marquis Ying, it was practically a thunderclap.Marquis Ying didn\u2019t even think about it before rushing over. He was just like a wild gale, and three or four miles was instantly traversed.That sound had definitely not been natural. He knew it was the sound of someone accidentally tripping on a stone.Within this silent forest, other than him, the only one who would make such a noise was Long Chen.Thinking of Long Chen, flames of fury rose inside him. Last night, he hadn\u2019t gotten the slightest bit of sleep and hadn\u2019t even had time to rest his wounds.Those damn beasts had become enraged and continuously attacked him. Although they were unable to pose any danger to him, they had troubled his internal injury.It was impossible for a medicinal pill alone to completely heal his injury. He had to combine it with spiritual qi in order to recover. But he hadn\u2019t had any time or opportunity to do so.He was forced into being unable to maintain his peak combat ability, causing him to feel a great sense of unease. So he urgently needed to kill Long Chen and return to the capital to recover.In just a couple of breaths\u2019 time, Marquis Ying arrived at where the sound had come from, but there was no sign of Long Chen anywhere. Under a tree was the rock that had made the noise, and it seemed the rock had writings on it.Marquis Ying looked over the surroundings and his expression became ugly when he saw no sign of Long Chen. He knew that he had most likely been played.He slowly walked over to that rock, wanting to know what Long Chen had wanted to show him. He had just walked a couple of steps when he suddenly stepped on a string that activated the short bush not far from him. A ball of something wrapped in a green leaf shot towards him.Marquis Ying coldly laughed and raised his sword, slicing that ball in half.\u201cHmph, you little insec\u201dHe hadn\u2019t expected that the moment his sword touched that ball, the ball exploded, filling the air with juice.Due to that happening so fast and being so close, Marquis Ying was unable to get away in time and was completely drenched by that juice. An incomparably disgusting smell filled the air.Some of it had also gotten into his mouth, so now his mouth was also full of that disgusting stench. Marquis Ying hastily retreated, his first thought being that it was poison.But although that thing had been incomparably disgusting, it didn\u2019t have traces of poison in it. His spiritual qi was circulating completely normally.Now that he had time, he noticed that the rock on the ground had flipped over to reveal the following words:\u201cJust a small gift which is unworthy of you. Originally, I wanted to send you a large lump, but recently my stomach hasn\u2019t been feeling well. Please forgive my helplessness.\u201dLooking at the words, Marquis Ying\u2019s face suddenly turned completely white. Looking at the sticky residue left on his clothes, his stomach began to heave and he vomited.\u201cLONG CHEN!!!\u201dMarquis Ying\u2019s incredibly angry roar practically blew apart the clouds above him. It caused the entire forest to shake, and countless birds and beasts were frightened into flight.Long Chen was on a distant tree watching those birds. He smiled heartily. He had finally released some of his anger at being chased like this.Ever since that day, Marquis Ying\u2019s face became even darker and Long Chen became even more careful, not daring to set up such a trap again.If he ended up making a slight mistake when setting it up, he would definitely be doomed. That small trap had been to relieve his anger and to increase his self-confidence.Since he had managed to do that, it wouldn\u2019t be smart to set something like that up again. Only by being careful could he survive. He didn\u2019t want his hard-worked advantage to be reversed.One fled while one chased. Eight days quickly passed by. Over that time, Long Chen fled during the day and recuperated during the night after using all kinds of different techniques to hide from the wild beasts.Due to the assistance of his medicinal pills, Long Chen\u2019s recovery was extremely quick. His right hand\u2019s meridians had almost completely recovered. His inner injuries had also nearly healed.Ever since the first night where he had drawn over many beasts, Marquis Ying had become smarter and also rested during the night. He would jump up into a high tree, using the time to rest and heal his wounds. His efficiency was also very fast.This continued up until the ninth day. Long Chen was crossing a small stream when he sensed a strange movement above his head.Looking up, his expression greatly changed. Crap, I\u2019m screwed.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 Final ShowdownPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeOn the ninth day, Long Chen\u2019s expression suddenly changed.There was simply a monkey at the top of a large tree. It wasn\u2019t very large, but its throat was extremely thick. It was looking at Long Chen guardedly.Long Chen immediately didn\u2019t even dare to move a muscle. He couldn\u2019t help but feel endless regret. Having played around with Marquis Ying with that \u2018gift\u2019 before, he had actually grown too careless.That monkey was just an ordinary beast. It didn\u2019t have any attacking strength, but it was precisely this monkey which caused Long Chen to enter a huge crisis.That monkey was a beast that liked to live in large groups. This part of the forest was obviously their territory, and that monkey should be a sentry.As soon as they sensed intruders or danger, they would immediately let out a loud howl to alert their comrades.Long Chen hadn\u2019t been paying enough attention to his surroundings and ended up running into their territory. He immediately realized he had made an inexcusable mistake. He began to slowly retreat, showing that he was leaving immediately.But it was already too late. That monkey let out a loud howl from atop that tree, its voice immediately spreading out dozens of miles.Long Chen\u2019s expression sunk. If he had been in range, he definitely would have immediately crushed that monkey in anger.The entire forest began to echo with more alarmed calls.Long Chen\u2019s pupils suddenly shrunk. From the distance, a figure was rushing over straight towards Long Chen.He could now see Marquis Ying whose eyes were brimming with killing intent. Now that Marquis Ying had already found him, running would be useless.Long Chen directly gave up any thoughts of escaping. Since he was already found, other methods were now useless. Now the only option was to risk his life.\u201cLong Chen, if I don\u2019t turn your bones to ashes then I won\u2019t be surnamed Ying!\u201d Marquis Ying arrived in just the blink of an eye.The current Marquis Ying\u2019s eyes were practically about to spit out flames. Each one of the past eight days had felt like a year. In particular, that gift, which Long Chen had sent him, had caused the extremely immaculate Marquis Ying to almost want to kill himself.Although he hadn\u2019t eaten a thing in the last eight days, he was still constantly vomiting. It seemed as if he wanted to even vomit out all of his stomach contents.In fact, at this time, Marquis Ying\u2019s hatred of Long Chen had already surpassed his hatred for Long Tianxiao. Seeing Long Chen standing right in front of him now, his body was incessantly quivering. As for the reason for that, perhaps only Marquis Ying knew it.\u201cWhether or not you\u2019re surnamed Ying has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m not your dad.\u201d Long Chen shook his head. The broadsword once more reappeared in his hands.Words had no meaning anymore. Having been on edge constantly over the past few days, his heart had actually calmed down now that he was facing Marquis Ying.He sensed that his current state had already reached his previous peak, so there was nothing to fear. It even seemed as if his cultivation realm had increased a level.That was an extremely mysterious feeling. He couldn\u2019t clearly explain it. But under Marquis Ying\u2019s constant pursuit, the scent of death had never been far. He felt as if he had transformed after that experience.\u201cHahahaha, are you provoking me now in hopes of me giving you a quick death? Stop dreaming. I\u2019ll make it so you live a life worse than death, a life that will make you regret ever being born in this world.\u201d Marquis Ying\u2019s face was extremely sinister.\u201cI don\u2019t need to provoke you. How was the taste of the gift I sent you last time?\u201d Long Chen asked lightly.Hearing the word \u2018gift\u2019, Marquis Ying\u2019s face immediately whitened and his stomach once more began to heave.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Marquis Ying angrily shouted, and his sword sliced through the air towards Long Chen.Long Chen had long since been prepared. He also sent his sword slashing forward.BANG! Long Chen was sent back a dozen of steps before being able to stabilize himself. His blood and qi were in an upheaval inside.Looking at Marquis Ying, he saw that he had only taken three steps back. He sighed; Tendon Transformation experts truly were a huge level above.His current strength had recovered to over ninety percent, but he was still not an equal match for Marquis Ying. Even in terms of his brute strength, he was completely outmatched by Marquis Ying.That was a clear difference. That was also why amongst the countless cultivators in Phoenix Cry, Marquis Ying was at the absolute apex.On the other side, Marquis Ying\u2019s eyes narrowed when he saw that Long Chen was actually able to block his blow. Alchemists truly did have ample preparations; when Long Chen had fled back then, he had already been halfway dead. But now he had mostly recovered.It was obvious Long Chen had consumed quite a few medicinal pills. But as for Marquis Ying, he wasn\u2019t an alchemist and his cultivation base was too high for most medicinal pills to work on him, so effective medicinal pills were extremely rare treasures for him.This caused intense envy inside of him. If he was also an alchemist or had such medicinal pills, how would it be possible for him to have still yet to recover to seventy percent even after all these days?Thinking of that, Marquis Ying felt that the heavens truly were unfair. Within the same generation as him was Long Tianxiao who had completely suppressed him, making it difficult for him to stand out.And then Long Tianxiao had an amazing son who had become a Pill Adept at a young age and was also a shockingly talented genius in terms of the martial path.Compared to Long Tianxiao, he was an absolute failure. His eyes reddened and green veins exploded out on his body. Coldly shouting and raising his sword, Sword Qi filled the air and shook the heavens.Long Chen took a deep breath. The current Marquis Ying was acting like a madman. Now that he was using his full strength to attack, Long Chen would be unable to block him.Touching his ring, he took out two medicinal pills. He threw one of them into his mouth and swallowed it.The other one was rubbed along his broadsword using his Spiritual Strength. Marquis Ying had been able to see him swallow a medicinal pill, and he assumed that Long Chen was using it to heal injuries.But the second medicinal pill had been hidden and silently spread across the broadsword\u2019s back. It had been impossible for Marquis Ying to see.Marquis Ying\u2019s sword was already crashing down upon him. Long Chen roared and also slashed out.In terms of sword techniques, Marquis Ying could play around with Long Chen as much as he wanted to. But the broadsword in Long Chen\u2019s hands was so long that it was a perfect counter to such a thing. So, Marquis Ying\u2019s exquisite techniques were completely useless.BOOM!The two swords collided and there was a huge explosion. A faint red gas immediately spread out and enveloped an area of thirty meters. The two of them were both swallowed by it.\u201cAHHH!\u201dThat red gas invaded Marquis Ying\u2019s body and he immediately let out a miserable scream. His exposed skin felt as if hot iron was branding it and the intense pain was simply unbearable.Not only that, but the red gas seemed to come alive and was doing its best to force its way into his body through his skin. Even though he had reacted at the very first moment and stopped breathing it in, it was absolutely useless.And that red gas also possessed an extremely terrifying corrosive nature. Blisters were quickly appearing on his skin. His flesh was rotting at a speed he could see with his naked eye.\u201cYou used poison?\u201d asked the shocked Marquis Ying angrily.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dLong Chen coldly laugh, but he also wasn\u2019t that well off. The poison pill refined from the Heart-Rot Grass was extremely powerful. Even he himself was unable to block it.Although he had taken an antitoxin pill, he was unable to completely defend against that poisonous gas. His body was also harmed and turned red as if he was being boiled.But he was still better off than Marquis Ying. That antitoxin pill allowed him to not have to worry about the poisonous gas corroding his heart. That was the most terrifying aspect of the poison pill refined from Heart-Rot Grass.That poison pill was his strongest life-saving measure. Marquis Ying truly was too powerful, so he had had no choice but to use it.Marquis Ying angrily roared and tried to send a full force attack at Long Chen. But his expression greatly changed; just as he began to circulate his spiritual qi, the poisonous gas that had just entered through his skin suddenly spread throughout his body quickly and then went straight for his heart.This completely terrified Marquis Ying. If such a powerful poison invaded his heart, even he, a Tendon Transformation expert, would not be able to live for more than a few moments. He hastily took out a medicinal pill from his ring and swallowed it.When Long Chen saw that pill, his expression changed. He hadn\u2019t expected Marquis Ying to possess such a medicinal pill.Just from its luster and the fragrance being emitted from it, Long Chen could identify that pill to be a Snow Toad Yaowan[1].The Snow Toad was an extremely rare Magical Beast. It didn\u2019t have a crystal core like other Magical Beasts. All its essence was focused on its Neidan[2].The Snow Toad was also a kind of poisonous beast. A matured Snow Toad was a second rank Magical Beast. The poisonous mist it spat out could immediately cover an area of hundreds of meters.That poisonous mist was able to poison other Magical Beasts to death and cause all vegetation to wither away. It was extremely frightening. But it was precisely because its poisonous gas was so powerful that even it was unable to endure it. Thus, its Neidan was used to help it survive even its own poison.Snow Toads were an extremely rare kind of Magical Beast from which both poison and antitoxins could be extracted. The Snow Toad Yaowan that could be refined from the Snow Toad\u2019s Neidan could cure hundreds of poisons.It was an extremely precious medicinal pill, which was why it was extremely surprising that Marquis Ying possessed it.Although it was said to resolve hundreds of poisons, it was mostly just a partial cure. But just resolving part of the poison was enough to reverse a person\u2019s fate.\u201cLong Chen, you actually forced me to use a precious pill that I\u2019ve hidden away for half of my life. Give me your life as the price!\u201dMarquis Ying\u2019s face was extremely twisted now. That pill was something he had obtained as a youth and had continuously hidden. But now because of a Qi Condensation weakling like Long Chen, he was forced to use it. His heart was practically dripping blood.Long Chen was greatly alarmed to see that the Snow Toad Yaowan was actually able to temporarily suppress the poisonous gas\u2019s attack on his heart. Marquis Ying charged at him, and in response, all twelve of his cyclones began to wildly spin, releasing his full strength. His sword danced in the air, meeting Marquis Ying\u2019s blows head on.BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!Consecutive exchanges caused explosive qi waves that flattened the huge trees around them, the power of just the aftershocks being absolutely shocking.Long Chen felt his arm turn numb under Marquis Ying\u2019s full force attacks. Blood stained the corner of his mouth and his internal organs were starting to be affected.But at this time, Long Chen still ground his teeth and continued to endure. He knew that the Snow Toad Yaowan would not be able to suppress his poison pill forever.BANG!Long Chen was sent flying, vomiting blood. But Marquis Ying didn\u2019t have the slightest happiness on his face. Instead, he was filled with horror.\u201cHehe, have you finally noticed? Did you really think the poison pill refined by me, Long Chen, was so easy to resolve?\u201d Long Chen wiped off the blood on his mouth and coldly laughed. The moment he had been waiting for had finally arrived.The Snow Toad Yaowan could resolve hundreds of poisons and its effectiveness was definitely shockingly high. But that was mostly for beast poisons. Long Chen\u2019s poison pill had been mostly refined from the Heart-Rot Grass. This caused the effectiveness of the Snow Toad Yaowan to sharply drop.A murderous aura overflowed from Marquis Ying. Taking a deep breath, he raised his sword and a terrifying aura filled the sword. Killing intent engulfed the forest.\u201cEven so, I\u2019ll still kill you!\u201dHis sword shot through the air. The terrifying power behind it cut through the space and released a sharp splitting sound. With endless killing intent, it slashed towards Long Chen.\u201cVoid Breaking Slash!\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That sword seemed completely unstoppable.That was Marquis Ying\u2019s most powerful sword technique. Long Chen knew that it was definitely also an Earth class Battle Skill, and it was even more powerful than the one he had used before. Its powerful aura completely locked him in place.Facing death, Long Chen\u2019s mind was completely calm. He entered a strange state at this moment. He seemed to have grasped everything within heaven and earth. Ten thousand laws and Daos, every single creature and object, everything was clearly captured within his mind right now.He felt as if he had already escaped from his body and was looking on as an observer.What Long Chen didn\u2019t know was that at this time, his FengFu Star had become completely static as if it was waiting for some kind of enlightenment. It was a shame that Long Chen hadn\u2019t noticed.Spiritual qi rushed towards his twelve cyclones. They explosively grew and cord-like energy surged through Long Chen\u2019s meridians to enter the broadsword in his hands.\u201cSplit the Heavens!\u201dStrange lines appeared over the broadsword, and it seemed to come alive. It cut through a mysterious arc, imposing just like an overpowering dragon. This was Long Chen\u2019s strongest attack.BOOM!! Waves of qi exploded outwards. Both of them were sent flying back, blood filling the sky.Long Chen\u2019s broadsword was sent flying out of his hands for hundreds of meters, only stopping once it sunk deep into a boulder.Vomiting out blood, Long Chen felt that his whole body was about to collapse and his aura plummeted.A dozen cuts appeared on his body which were bleeding heavily. But what was worse was that all the meridians in his body had become covered in cracks, just a bit away from completely breaking apart.And this was after Long Chen had gained the experience of using Split the Heavens last time. So when he had used it this time, he had used his entire body\u2019s meridians in order to brunt the explosive force that came from it.But because he had used even greater force that last time, he was really just the slightest bit away from becoming a completely crippled person.It was possible to regrow a small portion of destroyed meridians. That was because you could follow the \u2018memories\u2019 of the meridians before it. But if all the meridians in the body were destroyed, then even with a Pill God\u2019s memories, Long Chen would be completely powerless to fix it.The current him was now unable to use even the slightest trace of spiritual qi. His cracked meridians were unable to bear any force at the moment.On the other side, Marquis Ying\u2019s condition was not that much better than Long Chen\u2019s. The sword in his hand had shattered explosively, its fragments cutting into both of them.If it was just outer wounds, then Marquis Ying would still be able to use his powerful cultivation base to suppress them. But having used his most powerful attack just now, he had lost control of the extremely toxic poison inside him. A trace of that corrosive poison had entered his heart just now.However, just that slight trace caused his heart to show signs of withering. That completely terrified Marquis Ying, and he hastily used his spiritual qi to defend against the poison\u2019s invasion.Long Chen took a deep breath and stood up. Going over to his broadsword, he pulled it out of the rock, and slowly began to walk over to Marquis Ying.He could see a bit of blackness on Marquis Ying\u2019s forehead. That was one of the signs that the poison had reached his heart. It also meant that Marquis Ying was like him and couldn\u2019t use his spiritual qi.Now he could use his powerful physical body to go kill Marquis Ying.Long Chen wanted to rush over and split him in two, but his body was unbearably weak. Blood was flowing from the dozen wounds caused by Marquis Ying\u2019s shattered sword. If it weren\u2019t for his powerful physical body, he would have already run out of blood. But even so, bursts of dizziness caused him to feel as if he might faint at any time.However, he couldn\u2019t fall just yet. Even though he was already out of energy, his eyes were still calm without the slightest trace of emotion as he slowly walked towards Marquis Ying.\u201cYing Zhao, now the one who will die is you.\u201dLong Chen raised his sword and slashed down at Marquis Ying.Marquis Ying was worried to see that Long Chen still had the strength to come attack him. He hastily rolled to the side. When the broadsword slashed right past his cheeks, it was so close that he could feel the icy coldness coming from it.\u201cDamn, he actually still has so much strength!\u201dMarquis Ying\u2019s expression finally changed. That was the first time he had felt fear from an insignificant Qi Condensation ant. He was especially afraid of Long Chen\u2019s completely calm eyes.Long Chen was just like a deep well. He only revealed the slightest bit on the surface, but as for how deep he was, no one knew.Marquis Ying could sense the steady killing intent overflowing from him. Now he was at an absolute disadvantage. Without his spiritual qi, he was not a match for Long Chen\u2019s physical body.\u201cJust treat it as you being lucky today!\u201d Marquis Ying coldly sneered and actually turned to flee.\u201cYou want to run? Leave behind your life first!\u201d Long Chen shouted and charged forward in chase.However, the broadsword in his hand was too heavy and he was actually unable to catch up. In just a few short moments, he lost Marquis Ying\u2019s tail.Seeing Marquis Ying disappear, the anger on Long Chen\u2019s face faded to be replaced by relief. He suddenly felt the world spinning around him, and his vision blackened as he lost consciousness.\u2026Marquis Ying was celebrating that Long Chen was unable to catch up to him. Long Chen\u2019s physical body might be powerful, but his attacking strength resided with that broadsword.Now that broadsword had become a burden and caused him to be unable to catch up to him, letting Marquis Ying relax. He didn\u2019t know that Long Chen was actually completely spent; he had just used up all his final energy to put on an act to scare him off.In the end, Marquis Ying really was duped. After fleeing madly for a while, Marquis Ying suddenly felt his heart begin to violently beat. He realized his own spiritual qi was starting to run out and was unable to suppress the poison.He hastily took out a couple of medicinal pills and swallowed them. The Snow Toad Yaowan\u2019s medicinal energy was already starting to decline. But it had only countered an incredibly small portion of Long Chen\u2019s poison.He would definitely still die if he didn\u2019t promptly neutralize it. Now Marquis Ying could no longer even bother to think about Long Chen. His own life was more important.Over two hundred miles were traversed by him in just a day. He finally left the forest and arrived at a camp. Marquis Ying let out a breath of relief when he saw the camp.When the patrolling guards saw Marquis Ying covered in blood and on his last legs, they were all scared stupid. Was that really the Marquis Ying who was practically like a god to them?Marquis Ying grabbed one of those guards who appeared to be a squad leader and hastily spat out, \u201cSplit up your troops and sweep the entire forest. When you see him, you must kill him. Bring me\u2026 back to the capital\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, Marquis Ying was unable to continue and fainted. That squad only then reacted, quickly carrying away Marquis Ying and sending a report to the higher-ups.\u2026Returning back to the third day after Long Chen had killed Xia Changfeng. The fourth prince held a secret report and a light smile appeared on his face.\u201cLong Chen, you really didn\u2019t disappoint me.\u201dLightly putting down the report, he raised a cup of tea from the table and calmly drank a sip. Suddenly, his door was opened and a white-robed man walked in.Seeing that white-robed man, the fourth prince smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve already prepared some tea for you. But you came a bit later than I expected so it might not be perfect. Please, have some first and don\u2019t take offense.\u201dThat white-robed man\u2019s eyes had been icy cold and filled with killing intent, but because of the fourth prince\u2019s words, he became somewhat startled.\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d he icily asked.\u201cI know a bit.\u201d\u201cThen do you know why I\u2019ve come here?\u201d\u201cTo kill me,\u201d replied the fourth prince lightly. Those words which would cause a person\u2019s heart to jump in fear were actually said with extreme calmness.\u201cIf you know I came here to kill you, why are you so calm?\u201d The white-robed man\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cBecause I know you can\u2019t kill me.\u201d\u201cHaha, if I wanted to kill you, even all the people in the capital added together would be unable to stop me,\u201d laughed the white-robed man coldly.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of being able to block you. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t need to block you; I know you won\u2019t kill me.\u201d The fourth prince was completely certain.\u201cOh? Well, I\u2019d like to hear a bit more about that.\u201d Apparently, the white-robed man had become a bit interested in what the fourth prince had to say.\u201cFor one thing, I bet that Xia Changfeng wasn\u2019t the most cooperative partner. He was an imbecile, and so he had to die.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Continue.\u201d\u201cNow you have a better partner, someone who can serve you much better, someone who can complete twice the work with half the effort.\u201d\u201cYou mean yourself?\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cAnd your proof of that?\u201d\u201cThe proof is that I have an overall comprehension of your guys\u2019 plans. I know how you can win without the slightest blood.\u201d The fourth prince was completely sure of himself.Seeing that the white-robed man didn\u2019t say anything, the fourth prince continued, \u201cYou\u2019ve been setting your plan in motion for over twenty years. Ever since the beginning when you sent my mother to marry the Phoenix Cry Emperor, you\u2019ve done everything extremely carefully. Your goal was to not attract too much movement.\u201cYou used me and my mother to succeed in controlling the entire Phoenix Cry Empire. The Emperor is already dead and the Empress Dowager is under my mother\u2019s control.\u201cThe people who know this secret are all our people, with the exception of Long Tianxiao. So the only person that we need to worry about is Long Tianxiao.\u201cBut Long Tianxiao has refused to surrender to us even after all these years. He seems to have also sensed some clues that raised his guard. He has always refused to return to the capital.\u201cSo right now, Long Tianxiao is the greatest obstacle in your plans. Am I correct?\u201dThe white-robed man frowned. \u201cEverything you said is useless. You might as well have not said anything.\u201dThe fourth prince smiled slightly. \u201cWhat if I said that I could resolve the problem of Long Tianxiao? Would that still be useless?\u201d\u201cYou can do that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything I wasn\u2019t sure of. I was born in Phoenix Cry, destined to be a chess piece. I\u2019ve already endured the lifestyle of underhanded schemes that cannot see the light of day. So, I want to cooperate with you. I\u2019ll help you handle Long Tianxiao, and you help me become the Emperor.\u201d The fourth prince\u2019s breathing became a bit heavy at this point. Obviously, this was an extremely tense moment.Although he was also a prince, he had really been born into this world with a mission to be a spy. He would forever be like a ghost, never allowed to see the true light.He had been suppressed for too long. He needed to be set free. When he had seen Xia Changfeng abusing his power arrogantly like an idiot, he had decided that he would kill that bastard and make himself the white-robed man\u2019s partner.The white-robed man looked at the fourth prince. \u201cWhat\u2019s your bargaining chip?\u201dThe fourth prince celebrated inside when he saw that the white-robed man hadn\u2019t declined. Full of confidence, he handed something over to him.Seeing that thing, the white-robed man was shocked.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were countless symbols drawn into the page. They didn\u2019t seem exactly like words, but they weren\u2019t exactly not.\u201cYou can communicate with the barbarian tribes?\u201d The white-robed man asked with astonishment.The barbarian tribes were precisely called \u2018barbarian\u2019 because they lived just like wild beasts. But they had their own crude culture and language.These ugly symbols were precisely the barbarian tribes\u2019 script. Many people had seen that script before, but they had no idea how to read them.

At that time, I had already started gathering the bargaining chips that would change my destiny.\u201cI sent countless people to the barbarian tribes to try joining them, but they only treated those people as food.

To tell the truth, three years ago, I already possessed the power to help you seize the Phoenix Cry Empire without the slightest drop of blood, but that wouldn\u2019t have brought me even the slightest benefits.\u201dThe white-robed man nodded. \u201cContinue.\u201d\u201cSo, in order to handle Long Tianxiao, I purposely stopped supplying him reinforcements. I also secretly drew the poor people in the vicinity towards Long Tianxiao\u2019s army. I raised Long Tianxiao\u2019s prestige in secret, letting everyone think he was a god who would protect them. I know what kind of person Long Tianxiao is. He definitely wouldn\u2019t sacrifice the lives of those commoners.\u201d The fourth prince indifferently raised his teacup and took a sip.\u201cChu Xia, you really are talented.\u201d That was the first time the white-robed man praised the fourth prince.The fourth prince\u2019s move had been exceptionally brilliant. He had used the lives of the ordinary commoners to effortlessly lock Long Tianxiao in place.Most importantly, that was a ploy without a solution. Even if Long Tianxiao understood it, he was helpless. He was unable to ignore the lives of millions of commoners.Such a simple scheme had kept Long Tianxiao permanently locked at the border. Even the white-robed man felt a bit of admiration.\u201cUnfortunately, those barbarian tribes truly did cause me extreme disappointment. I secretly sent them so much assistance in terms of food and supplies, but they are still only just able to fight on the same level as Long Tianxiao. So, they ended up in a permanent battle of attrition. Well, I suppose that is all that can be expected from those uncivilized barbarians.\u201d The fourth prince shook his head.The white-robed man pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cTell me, where is Long Chen?\u201d\u201cHe should already be dead. If my calculations are correct, his head should be en route back to the capital. That Long Chen really is an oddity. But I\u2019m not someone who likes the unexpected, so I sent Marquis Ying over. I trust that you know Marquis Ying\u2019s power.\u201dThe white-robed man\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cI know of him. His cultivation base can count as not bad. But using him to handle a small Qi Condensation ant is making a bit too big of a fuss for a minor nuisance.\u201dThe fourth prince\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. But hearing what he said, it seemed that even the Tendon Transformation realm Marquis Ying wasn\u2019t anything to him.From that, it could be seen that this young man whose age didn\u2019t seem that different from his own had to possess an extremely terrifying strength. The fourth prince\u2019s guard went up even higher.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve already said I\u2019m a cautious person. I won\u2019t do anything I\u2019m not sure of. It\u2019s just like how I used Long Chen to kill that idiot Xia Changfeng this time.\u201dThe white-robed man nodded. \u201cYou really are much better than Xia Changfeng. I can overlook Xia Changfeng\u2019s death and also accomplish your wish. However, if you end up being worse than Xia Changfeng, I can tell you very clearly that even your own death will become something you are unable to control.\u201dThe white-robed man\u2019s gentle manner of speaking became dark, and an ominous aura filled the air.The fourth prince ignored his threat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019ve endured patiently for many years just for this chance. I treasure this opportunity even more than you.\u201d\u201cThen good. With Long Chen dead now, I need to know what your plan is for later.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t underestimate Long Chen, in front of a Tendon Transformation expert, Long Chen would definitely not have even the slightest chance of surviving.\u201cYing Zhao will bring his head back to the capital as well as a recording of Long Chen killing Xia Changfeng. Then, I will need you to communicate with the Grand Xia and get them to send out their elite army to surround the capital. At that time, I will call back Marquis Ying and Marquis Wu here. The Grand Xia will demand us to hand over the murderer, and in order for both empires to stay friends, I can offer up every person in the Long household in a justifiable manner. In fact, I can kill all of them at a suitable time,\u201d explained the fourth prince.\u201cWhat do you mean by a suitable time? And furthermore, when you say \u2018them\u2019, it seems you aren\u2019t just talking about the Long household?\u201d asked the white-robed man lightly.The fourth prince laughed, \u201cSpeaking with a smart person really does save energy. You\u2019re correct. Before I execute the people from the Long household, I will have the barbarian tribes attack Long Tianxiao\u2019s station at the same time. At that time, I will send news of his family being executed. In the face of the barbarian tribes\u2019 invasion and with the lives of countless commoners on the line, he definitely won\u2019t bring his whole army back to the capital. According to my understanding of him, he will leave his entire army back there to guard and come back to the capital alone to rescue his family. Hehe, at that time, Marquis Ying and Marquis Wu will join hands to kill him without a problem. Furthermore, we\u2019ll even have an honorable reason for doing so, so it won\u2019t cause any huge ripples. As for \u2018them\u2019, I naturally mean those people who aren\u2019t suitable of being near me. Long Chen has received the crown prince\u2019s \u2018support\u2019 in killing Xia Changfeng. One of his close guards will testify to that. At that time, we just have to gather a bit of \u2018evidence\u2019. In order for the two great empires to remain allies, even the crown prince can be used as a sacrifice. And as for his henchmen, although they didn\u2019t directly participate, they are definitely extremely suspicious. In order to maintain the empires\u2019 friendship, it\u2019s best to just also sacrifice them as well.\u201dThe white-robed man stared at the fourth prince for a great deal of time before sighing, \u201cWhat profound scheming. In that way, the entire Phoenix Cry Empire will easily land in your hands. Chu Xia, you really are a genius.\u201d\u201cMany thanks for the praise. But you don\u2019t have to worry; my Spirit Root is completely ordinary and I\u2019m unable to walk the cultivation path. I don\u2019t possess the slightest threat to you,\u201d said the fourth prince.The white-robed man smiled slightly. He had already secretly examined the fourth prince\u2019s body and found that his talent truly was extremely ordinary.Towards such an intelligent and deeply scheming person, he had to be a bit more careful. He definitely didn\u2019t want to unwittingly fall into someone else\u2019s trap.If the fourth prince was an extremely talented person in terms of cultivation, then he would definitely possess an extremely great threat to him. Who knew whether or not the fourth prince would end up using even him to step into even higher realms.Now all his misgivings were dispelled. The fourth prince was incapable of cultivating to a high level. All he cared about was the secular world\u2019s power. It was just like he had said; both of them needed each other.Gently raising his teacup, the white-robed man smiled. \u201cExcellent, Xia Changfeng\u2019s death truly is a good thing. I hope we can happily cooperate.\u201dThe fourth prince also raised his teacup. The two of them toasted and drained their cups in one gulp.The white-robed suddenly thought of a matter. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Xia Changfeng have a little sister? Is she still in the imperial palace?\u201dA bit of disgust appeared on the fourth prince\u2019s face. \u201cYes, that idiot woman was left behind by Xia Changfeng in order to control us.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to kill her?\u201d\u201cWell, she is a Pill Adept and has a particular status. I got her two handsome, strong men to wait on her. She\u2019s busy with them and won\u2019t bring any big trouble to us.\u201dThe white-robed man nodded. That Xia Baichi truly was a complete idiot. He relaxed knowing that the fourth prince had handled her.As for the death of her brother, she definitely wouldn\u2019t care about that. They had never had any family love to speak of. As long as nothing bad happened to her, she wouldn\u2019t care.Furthermore, Xia Changfeng was killed by Long Chen. Even if she did feel some hatred, that hatred would land on Long Chen.\u201cRight, brother Luo, I have something I want to ask your help for.\u201d After the two of them had reached a common understanding, the fourth prince directly switched to calling him brother.\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cYou also know that in order for me to control Marquis Ying and Marquis Wu, they have been promised that once this matter is accomplished, they will get half of the empire. Back then when I promised them, I was fine with it since I didn\u2019t have any hope of obtaining the empire. So being generous with them also didn\u2019t cause me any pain. But now all of Phoenix Cry is about to land into my hands. How can I allow others to control my land? So\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want me to help you bring them under your control?\u201d\u201cPretty much. I hope brother Luo can teach me how to make them listen to me obediently and also not have them form any thoughts of rebellion,\u201d said the fourth prince carefully.The white-robed man laughed. \u201cChu Xia, ah, Chu Xia. You are ruthless. You really are willing to do anything to achieve your goals. Okay, I promise you that once this matter is finished, I\u2019ll teach you a technique that will let you make those two into your slaves.\u201dHearing that, the fourth prince was overjoyed. Now everything was going according to his plans. With the final part of the plan about to be finished, Marquis Ying and Marquis Wu had become his greatest problem.Back then, he had promised to give them control of half the empire. That was equivalent to them being local emperors.That was how Marquis Ying and Marquis Wu had been coaxed by the fourth prince\u2019s carrot and stick persuasions to secretly form an agreement. But only the three of them had known about it.Now the fourth prince had obtained an opportunity to free himself from that. He naturally was unwilling to have others control his empire. The white-robed man\u2019s promise meant that he no longer needed to be worried about that.Although the fourth prince didn\u2019t have a complete understanding of the white-robed man, he knew his origin was definitely shocking and beyond his imaginations.So he needed to rely on him. As long as he had the white-robed man\u2019s support, whether it was the Phoenix Cry Empire or the Grand Xia Empire, he would be able to have whatever he wanted.Now everything was prepared. They only needed one last thing. Once Marquis Ying came back, the final phase of the plan could commence. However, what they didn\u2019t know was that in this world, there was always one thing that never went away. Those were called mishaps.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 Mysterious VoicePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeWhen Long Chen once more opened his eyes, he had no idea how much time had passed. Perhaps it had just been an hour; perhaps it had been a whole day.He had been roused by the sound of those howling monkeys. Looking over his body, most of the blood on his wounds had already dried.That was definitely something to feel lucky about. Otherwise, he would definitely have died if he had kept bleeding out. Slowly standing up, he felt the world spinning around him and almost fell to the ground again.Leaning against a large tree, he had to wait for a while before feeling a little better. Raising his head to look around, he saw that there were dozens of monkeys on the crowns of the trees. Several of them were howling as loud as they could.Long Chen knew that most likely meant something had invaded this part of the forest. However, was that something beast or human?But no matter what, either was a threat to Long Chen. With a wave of his hand, he placed the broadsword into his spatial ring.Looking over his wounds, he ground his teeth and consumed a medicinal pill. Just that slight raise of his hand caused some of his wounds to tear open.Blood immediately flowed out. Some of these wounds actually had fragments of Marquis Ying\u2019s sword still in them. Being made from cold iron, those fragments were definitely extremely dangerous to the body. They couldn\u2019t be left inside for too long.Although this wasn\u2019t the best place to handle them, if he let them stay in his body any longer, they would greatly hinder his movements.Long Chen first consumed a few blood clotting pills and did his best to keep the flow of blood at a minimum. If he lost too much blood, then he wouldn\u2019t even have the energy to walk.With his skillful effort, Long Chen dug out over a dozen sword fragments from his body. Both he and Marquis Ying had been hit by those pieces when his sword had shattered.After taking out those sword fragments, Long Chen still felt extremely dizzy, a sign he had lost too much blood. Looking up at the monkeys in the trees and hearing that their howls were becoming increasingly loud, Long Chen knew the targets in their eyes were quickly approaching.After consuming several medicinal pills, he dragged his exhausted body down the mountain. Now that Marquis Ying had fled, he also needed to quickly find a place to heal his wounds.In that final exchange with Marquis Ying, he had used Split the Heavens. That had caused all his meridians to crack, and he was unable to use spiritual qi anymore. This was his weakest state.He went over ten miles down a mountain when a river dozens of meters wide appeared before him. Long Chen looked around and saw a wide fallen tree. He pushed that tree into the water.That tree had been dead for a long time and floated very well in the water. Long Chen crawled on top, allowing his body to be carried down the river without letting the water touch his wounds. Otherwise, the river water would cause his wounds to become even worse.Luckily, the river flowed very steadily and Long Chen easily managed to stay atop the tree. He flowed along the river for a full day. In a drowsy state, he was suddenly awakened by a loud, continuous booming sound.Long Chen hastily paddled to the shore. Looking ahead, he was given a big fright as he saw the waterfall before him.That waterfall was hundreds of meters high. If he had kept sleeping and fallen down, he would definitely have been done for.The river had yet to exit the forest. Long Chen knew he had to quickly find a place to heal his wounds. Previously, Long Chen had faked coming ashore along several places on the river, so anyone searching for him would definitely have to waste a great deal of time on those diversions.That should be enough time for him to recuperate. But before that, he still had to find a safe place.Going through the forest, he saw a canyon before him. The canyon wasn\u2019t large, and it was bordered by stones on either side. Such a place should have a couple of natural caves that were suitable for shelter.Just as he was about to go forward, he suddenly felt a sense of danger as well as a burst of wind coming from behind. He hastily rolled forward.A huge creature came flying from behind him, and he only narrowly dodged.Long Chen rolled along the ground. When he raised his head to look, he saw that it was a large leopard over three meters tall that was staring at him.\u201cCliff Leopard.\u201d Long Chen felt a huge headache. That was a first rank Magical Beast. Its fur was the same color as the cliff rocks. When it was hiding itself amongst the rocks, it was extremely hard to notice.It wasn\u2019t exceptionally large, but its speed was shocking. Its claws and teeth were not inferior to steel.Having been injured so greatly, his spiritual perception had sharply fallen. He had actually not been able to sense the danger around him. It appeared he had become too dependant on his senses.That Cliff Leopard appeared somewhat startled that it hadn\u2019t taken him down with one blow. It charged at Long Chen again with its incredible speed.A normal leopard wasn\u2019t frightening, but the Cliff Leopard\u2019s body was just like a bull. Adding on its sharp claws and teeth, it was at the top of the first rank Magical Beast food chain.Long Chen coldly snorted. Rubbing his ring, his broadsword appeared back in his hands and he slashed it at the Cliff Leopard.The broadsword landed right on the Cliff Leopard\u2019s head, but it was Long Chen who was forced back. His broadsword actually got knocked out of his hands and he was sent flying.\u201cDamn, I don\u2019t even have a tenth of my normal strength!\u201dLong Chen was unable to use spiritual qi at the moment. Furthermore, his physical body was gravely injured.His sword had slashed right onto the Cliff Leopard\u2019s head, yet the sword was knocked away and he was sent flying. Some of his wounds even opened and began to bleed again.Although Long Chen was in an extremely weak state, his power was still quite great. That Cliff Leopard\u2019s head had been cut by his sword all the way down to the bone. If a regular wild beast received such a heavy injury, they would definitely flee in pain.But Magical Beasts had an innate, tyrannical nature deep in their bones. Long Chen\u2019s attack had instead provoked its violent nature, and it didn\u2019t even care about the blood flowing down its head as it angrily charged at Long Chen again.Long Chen rolled on the ground again, dodging its wild charge. At the same time, he also sent out a kick that heavily landed on its abdomen.That Cliff Leopard was sent tumbling through the air, but its skin and flesh were tough. Long Chen\u2019s kick hadn\u2019t caused any wounds.As soon as it stabilized itself, it once more charged at Long Chen. Long Chen was extremely anxious inside. If he had a sword, he would definitely be able to kill it.However, that broadsword had been sent flying thirty meters away. Such a distance was essentially right beside him during ordinary times, but now he was in a tangle with the Cliff Leopard. Adding on the blood loss, his body was extremely weak. That thirty meters distance was simply untraversable for him.His body was exceptionally weak, and his reactions were not as sharp as normal. He once more dodged the Cliff Leopard, but its sharp claws managed to cut across his stomach lightly, causing more blood to flow.Long Chen once more kicked it, sending it flying. But after that kick, Long Chen\u2019s eyes darkened, and he was unable to see anything more.He sighed inside. He had already lost too much blood. He was actually on the verge of losing consciousness. \u201cWho would have thought that I, Long Chen, would die here at the hands of a wild animal\u2026\u201dIn that darkness, he could sense its bloody mouth. He was about to be swallowed into its stomach.Plop.He heard something, and then he felt his throat warm up as if some liquid was being poured into his throat.He then heard some extremely distant sounds. Those sounds seemed human, one sounding like a woman. Then, he sunk into complete and endless darkness.Within that darkness, Long Chen felt as if his body was floating. It felt like he was both rising and falling at the same time. He was completely trapped within that darkness.\u201cYou must awaken. You have far too many missions that are awaiting for you to finish.\u201cYou must become stronger. You have far too many enemies waiting for you to slaughter.\u201cYour destiny is to overturn heaven and earth. All gods and devils can only crawl under your foot. Long Chen, quickly awaken.\u201dWithin that endless darkness, Long Chen could hear a voice repeatedly speaking. That was a call that came from the deepest depths of his soul.Long Chen heard it and wanted to reply. However, he was unable to open his mouth. He wanted to open his eyes, but he was completely powerless.That voice didn\u2019t seem to be of this world. Could it be that it was part of the past or future? He was unable to touch it.Once Long Chen memorized those three lines, he completely lost any sense of himself. Sinking into complete unconsciousness, he extremely faintly felt a pair of hands gently rubbing his face, a gentleness that felt like that of a mother.\u2026The fourth prince\u2019s expression was exceedingly ugly. Marquis Ying was lying on a bed, his body completely black. He couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes.A Tendon Transformation expert had gone out to kill a Qi Condensation ant only to end up in such a state. Who would possibly believe such a thing?When he had heard his subordinates\u2019 report that Marquis Ying had been heavily injured, he had first thought that Marquis Ying had met some sort of powerful Magical Beast.But looking at Marquis Ying\u2019s current half-dead state, a youthful face appeared in his mind.He didn\u2019t know why, but when he thought of that face, he immediately became panicked. The most important part of his plan had failed.Although he had never underestimated Long Chen, he had never expected that he would be able to escape from Marquis Ying and even force Marquis Ying into such a sorry state.\u201cI was overconfident.\u201d Marquis Ying was ashamed. A grand Tendon Transformation expert had almost lost his life in trying to kill someone at Qi Condensation. That was definitely a disgrace.The fourth prince shook his head. \u201cI know your character. You wouldn\u2019t carelessly be overconfident against someone and lose like this. It can only be said that we both underestimated Long Chen. I\u2019m also at fault.\u201dIt went without saying that the fourth prince was exceptionally talented at manipulating people. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to win over apex experts like Marquis Ying and Marquis Wu.Just that one sentence from him completely excused Marquis Ying\u2019s failure and let him feel extremely comfortable inside.Since the matter had already occurred, getting angry would be completely useless. In fact, it would further anger Marquis Ying.In any case, looking at Marquis Ying\u2019s wounds, he had definitely not been too careless. He had only called himself overconfident to find an excuse for himself.Thinking of that, the fourth prince felt a burst of panic overcome him. Thinking of Long Chen\u2019s decisive and swift nature, his expression became increasingly ugly.But then thinking of the white-robed man who was his support, he relaxed a bit. Although Long Chen had run off, it didn\u2019t change his plans that much.He rubbed the photographic jade in his hand. Inside it was a complete recording of Long Chen and Wilde killing Xia Changfeng. With this, he would still be able to go forward with his plan.Long Chen\u2019s escape was definitely worrisome, but he didn\u2019t have any way to handle him at this point. He turned to Marquis Ying. \u201cYou can recover at ease. I\u2019ll get grandmaster Wei Cang to personally come to heal your wounds tomorrow. You\u2019ll be able to completely recover very quickly.\u201d\u201cMany thanks, prince.\u201d Marquis Ying hastily thanked him. That poison might be temporarily suppressed by him, but he was unable to dispel it. Long Chen\u2019s poison pill was just too terrifying.They had asked for help from the alchemist guild and grandmaster Yun Qi had also come. But after looking at Marquis Ying\u2019s wounds, grandmaster Yun Qi had only coldly stated that he was powerless to heal him.Marquis Ying had immediately understood that grandmaster Yun Qi had realized some clues from his body and so he had refused to save him.Hearing that Wei Cang would come relieved Marquis Ying greatly. Wei Cang would definitely be able to save him.The fourth prince went back to his room and began to pace around. After a while, he raised his brush and wrote a short missive, handing it to a guard.Looking at the darkness that was descending on the sky, the fourth prince sighed. Although Long Chen had escaped, they still had to continue with the plan.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, but seeing the light caused him to sigh in relief. He was still alive.He realized he was lying on a simple bed. Although the bed was made from coarse wood, the bedsheets had been arranged very carefully for him and even had a faint fresh scent.He was in a wooden room. The walls had a few animal hides, bows, arrows, and spears on them. Not far from his bed was a small stove that was releasing warmth. The smell of freshly cooked rice floated out of it.With a creaking sound, the door was opened. A maiden wearing a simple dress walked in.That woman appeared around sixteen years old. She was slender and tall. Her arms and legs were both bare, and her skin gave off a healthy glow.She wore her hair in a medium length ponytail. She wasn\u2019t overly beautiful, but her bright eyes appeared very friendly.That woman first put down her backsack before hastily opening the iron cooking pot atop the stove.That young lady let out a relieved sigh when she looked at the food inside. \u201cAh, close. I almost burnt it,\u201d she muttered to herself.But she suddenly sensed something was a bit off and slowly turned to see that Long Chen was looking at her in confusion.\u201cAh, you\u2019ve awoken! Great!\u201d She quickly ran over to Long Chen and hugged him excitedly.\u201cCough\u2026 miss, isn\u2019t this a bit unsuitable?\u201d Being hugged by this young lady, he could feel her chest against his as well as smell a fresh and energetic scent from her.But being hugged by a stranger truly did cause him to feel uncomfortable and awkward.\u201cWhat\u2019s unsuitable about it? I pulled you back here, so now you\u2019re my man. That\u2019s the rule of our village, so who would dare criticize us?\u201d That maiden was still hugging onto Long Chen very intimately, acting as if everything was as it should be.\u201cYou\u2026? Pulled me back?\u201d Long Chen was startled. His last memory was of the Cliff Leopard. He hadn\u2019t seen this maiden before.Seeing his confusion, the maiden released him and said, \u201cThat day when you fought with the Magical Beast, at the last moment I shot it with my arrow. To say it directly, your life was saved by me. In the future, you\u2019ll be my man. Your tasks in the future will be to go hunting and make babies with me.\u201dLooking at her serious expression, Long Chen\u2019s expression became extremely odd. Hunting? And making babies?When she saw that Long Chen was still as puzzled as ever, she began to explain what had happened that day.That maiden was a huntress of the village. These villagers all relied on hunting to survive. Other than some essential metal tools that they had to get from a distant place outside the mountains, they were completely self-sufficient here.There were over a hundred villagers here, most of them expert hunters. Even some of the children frequently went outside the village to set up a couple of traps for smaller wild animals.There weren\u2019t any true experts in their village. The majority of them were only at Qi Condensation. According to this maiden, their ancestors had escaped to this place in order to avoid the flames of war. They gradually became accustomed to living here, and now hundreds of years had passed.The main food in the village was meat. They survived by relying on hunting and gathering. But their best targets were wild beasts.As for the larger, more powerful Magical Beasts, they had to treat them extremely carefully. If they wanted to hunt down a Magical Beast, they required the entire village to participate.A couple of weeks ago they had noticed that there was a Cliff Leopard in the vicinity. After a bit of investigation and after getting the approval of the village chief, they decided to hunt down that Cliff Leopard.Although killing Magical Beasts was extremely dangerous, the benefits were also accordingly great. The core of a first rank Magical Beast was enough for the entire village to live off of for half a year if exchanged for goods.In order to handle this Cliff Leopard, they had prepared for over a month. They had refined enough poisons to apply on their weapons and also stealthily set up many traps. They had finally been prepared to act against it.But just as they were about to take action against it, they had watched dumbstruck as a youngster walked over to its territory.That maiden had been hiding in secret along with many other hunters. She hadn\u2019t dared warn Long Chen. That would have alarmed the Cliff Leopard and ruined all the plans their village had spent over a month preparing.If they had ended up failing, the price would have been many of their lives. That was why they had only watched stupefied as Long Chen was ambushed.Originally, they had all been feeling guilty about that. They could only hope that the Cliff Leopard would soon enter one of their traps so that they could take their revenge for Long Chen.But the scene that had played out after that had astonished all of them. Long Chen\u2019s sword had almost killed the incomparably vicious Cliff Leopard in one blow.They then realized that Long Chen had actually been wounded severely beforehand. Even when the sword left his hands, he was still able to fight barehanded, exchanging several blows that sent the Cliff Leopard flying.At last, they saw that Long Chen was unable to keep going. She had been unable to bear it any further and shot out an arrow at the Cliff Leopard, killing it.But when she said that she had killed it with one arrow and saved Long Chen, she was actually somewhat embarrassed.Her archery skill wasn\u2019t actually so great. In a moment of desperation, she had shot without even thinking that much. But in the end, her arrow which had been aiming for the Cliff Leopard\u2019s mouth actually went straight through its forehead.That was coincidentally the same place that Long Chen had hit it with his sword. His slash had already caused the Cliff Leopard\u2019s skull to crack, so her arrow had managed to coincidentally pierce through that crack, killing it.When everyone had rushed forward to check out her attack, they couldn\u2019t help but take a cold breath. If it weren\u2019t for that luck, then the villagers which had angered a Magical Beast would definitely lose many lives.An injured Magical Beast was the most frightening. They would become crazy because of their fear and begin attacking all-out.\u201cMany thanks.\u201d When Long Chen finally learned what had happened, he respectfully and gratefully cupped his hands at her.\u201cYou\u2019ll be my man in the future, so there\u2019s no need for that.\u201d She giggled and supported Long Chen at the shoulders. \u201cBefore, I would send prayers to the forest god every day in hopes of it bestowing me a powerful man who would go hunting and make babies with me. Heehee, the forest divinity has finally heard my prayers and sent you to me.\u201dShe was completely infatuated with him. Looking at his heroic and handsome appearance, she was extremely satisfied.\u201cCough, miss\u2026\u201d\u201cCall me Xiao Hua.\u201d\u201cUh, miss Xiao Hua, as for the matter of a man, let\u2019s discuss that later. Can you tell me just how my wounds were healed?\u201d asked Long Chen. That was because he had noticed his wounds had all miraculously recovered. But according to Xiao Hua, this was only the third day after he had encountered the Cliff Leopard.Without eating a single medicinal pill, not only had he miraculously healed in just a short three days, but even his cracked meridians had completely recovered. That was completely inconceivable.\u201cThe forest god helped heal you,\u201d replied Xiao Hua.\u201cForest god?\u201d Did gods really exist in this world?\u201cThat\u2019s too many questions for right now. Let\u2019s eat first.\u201dXiao Hua cut off Long Chen\u2019s questioning and brought the large pot from the stove outside.Long Chen didn\u2019t want to fake being injured, so he hastily went to help. He found that the large pot was filled with merely thin porridge.After carrying the pot outside the wooden house, Long Chen saw that this village was built against the side of a mountain.Thick fences ten meters high made of thistles and thorns surrounded the village. Those thistles and thorns were very poisonous plants. Most wild beasts would generally avoid them.Within the village were dozens of simple wooden houses. After Xiao Hua\u2019s call, all of them walked over to her house. There were a dozen children and five or six seniors.But the majority were all youths or adults in their prime. Since they survived through hunting, it would be extremely dangerous if their physical strength lagged behind. A single person\u2019s carelessness could lead to the loss of multiple lives.That was why the majority of the people in the village were all in the prime of their lives. That was life\u2019s cruel natural elimination over time.A healthy old man walked up to Long Chen and nodded. \u201cExcellent. A person capable of fighting against a Magical Beast on his own.\u201dLong Chen swept his senses out and found that this senior was in the Blood Condensation realm. However, he was only at the early stage.If Long Chen\u2019s guess wasn\u2019t wrong, this old man should have only managed to enter Blood Condensation very late in his years. His Blood Qi had already started to decline. Despite stepping into Blood Condensation, his combat ability probably hadn\u2019t increased by much at all.\u201cSenior flatters me.\u201d Long Chen bowed slightly.\u201cI don\u2019t dare to be called senior by you. Even in my prime, I was unable to compare to you.\u201d That old man was filled with admiration for Long Chen.\u201cGrandpa, hurry up and eat!\u201dXiao Hua had already split up the porridge for everyone. She brought two bowls for Long Chen and the old man.\u201cLet me introduce you two. This is my grandpa, the village chief. Oh right, I still don\u2019t know your name,\u201d asked Xiao Hua suddenly.\u201cThanks. My name is Long Chen.\u201d Long Chen laughingly received his bowl of porridge.Everyone from the village, young and old, male or female, now came over to welcome Long Chen. He had to hastily put down his bowl to greet them all.They had saved his life. That favor had to be remembered. These people were all very simple and sincere. Their etiquettes were a bit strange to him, but the friendly warmth in their eyes already said everything to him.There were over a hundred people in the village. There were only thirty females in the village, and Xiao Hua was the only young maiden amongst them.\u201cBig brother, I heard you\u2019re really strong! Did you really send a giant leopard flying with a single punch?\u201dA small child that didn\u2019t even reach his knee hugged Long Chen\u2019s leg. He looked at Long Chen with worship.\u201cOf course it\u2019s true. My dad told me that big brother is a true warrior. Once he\u2019s with big sis Hua, their babies will be the strongest fighters in our village!\u201d Long Chen didn\u2019t even know how to respond before another child scrambled over.That child then looked at Long Chen eagerly. \u201cBig brother, when are you going to let our village\u2019s strongest fighters be born?\u201dLong Chen\u2019s expression stiffened and the surrounding people all laughed heartily. Even Xiao Hua laughed, making Long Chen feel more embarrassment.He quickly changed the topic, \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys kill the Magical Beast? Why aren\u2019t you eating its meat?\u201dAs soon as he said, the joyous atmosphere immediately became strange. They all turned to look at the village chief.He was just about to say something when Xiao Hua interjected, \u201cI should be the one to tell you about this.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 Forest GodPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cI should be the one to tell you about this.\u201dXiao Hua looked at Long Chen and then glanced at her grandpa.\u201cXiao Hua\u2026\u201d The old man frowned.\u201cGrandpa, Long Chen is my man. He will also be one of our villager\u2019s people in the future. He has the right to know about this.\u201dThe old man argued no more. The others all quickly drank their thin porridge and returned to their homes, leaving only the three of them.\u201cThat Magical Beast was offered as a sacrifice,\u201d explained Xiao Hua to Long Chen.\u201cOffered as a sacrifice?\u201d That was the first time Long Chen had heard of such a thing.\u201cYes. Your wounds were too severe, and you were on the verge of death. We had no other method but to send you to the forest god. The forest god healed you, but the price was that we had to offer the Magical Beast as a sacrifice. That\u2019s also why you were able to completely recover in just a short three days.\u201dDid gods really exist in this world? That completely toppled his understanding.\u201cNot only that, but because your injuries were so severe, our village also had to offer all the meat we had stored away. And even so, we still owe the forest god more. We\u2019ll have to pay back our debt slowly through hunting.\u201dOnly now did Long Chen understand why the entire village only had some thin porridge to eat.The young men definitely required meat in order to get stronger. But because of him, they could only go hungry. He couldn\u2019t help but feel bad about this.\u201cLong Chen, I\u2019m explaining this to you not so that you will feel guilty. But you\u2019re also a member of the village now, so I thought you had the right to know this.\u201d Xiao Hua quietly explained this all.However, that only made him feel even more ashamed. This kind of trust and goodwill made him feel incomparably warm, especially since he was used to the cruel schemes inside the royal capital.\u201cCan you tell me about this forest god?\u201dXiao Hua looked at her grandpa, and only after he nodded did she tell him a true story that was practically mythic.Not long after this village was first established, one of their ancestors found an extremely mystical tree. At that time, that ancestor had been wounded by a Magical Beast and almost died. After fleeing from it, he had arrived there.The tree had dripped a drop of liquid onto him, and their ancestor\u2019s heavy wounds had completely healed in just half a day.In order to thank the large tree, they had hunted down a wild beast and placed it as a sacrifice in front of the large tree. Then, they saw the huge tree actually swallowed away that dead beast in the blink of an eye.Ever since then, whenever someone was injured, the villagers would all run over to the tree to be treated, and every time the tree would completely restore them.In order to display their reverence and respect for the tree, they had begun to call it the forest god. Not long after they began to offer sacrifices to the tree, it actually began to communicate with them and established an agreement with them.It could heal the villagers\u2019 wounds, but they would need to offer sacrifice to it in reciprocation. As for the amount of the sacrifice, it would depend on how heavy the wounds were.This was just like a doctor asking for payment. But in all these years, the forest god had never asked for that much as a reward.However, Long Chen was an exception now. The forest god had demanded a shocking price to save Long Chen.\u201cWhat did it want?\u201d asked Long Chen.Xiao Hua looked at Long Chen and ground her teeth. \u201cTen first rank Magical Beast and one second rank Magical Beast.\u201dLong Chen was shocked. A single first rank Magical Beast already required Xiao Hua\u2019s entire village to prepare for a long time and it still posed an extremely great danger.As for a second rank Magical Beast, that would require several Blood Condensation experts to join hands in order to kill one. To the villagers, that was something completely impossible. That so-called forest god\u2019s price was far too great.Looking at Long Chen\u2019s indignant expression, Xiao Hua hastily said, \u201cLong Chen, you definitely can\u2019t feel any resentment towards the forest god; the forest god has always been extremely fair over all these years. No matter how heavily injured we were, it never required such a high price. There\u2019s definitely a reason for it to demand so much this time. Plus, now you\u2019re healed. You can help us, and I trust that we\u2019ll be able to quickly repay our debt. Even if it was ten second rank Magical Beasts, we still would have accepted. We couldn\u2019t just silently watch you die\u2026\u201dIn the end, Xiao Hua began to sob. She fell into Long Chen\u2019s chest. Her grandpa sighed, \u201cLong Chen, the forest god is absolutely fair. There\u2019s definitely a reason for it to demand such a price. Don\u2019t get angry.\u201d\u201cI want to go see the forest god.\u201d Long Chen wanted to figure out just what this forest god was.As for the price that it had demanded, Long Chen wasn\u2019t worried at all. Now that he had recovered, first rank Magical Beasts could be killed in an instant. As for a second rank Magical Beast, as long as he wasn\u2019t careless, that was also something he could bring down.A second rank Magical Beast was equivalent to a human Blood Condensation expert. However, due to how tough a Magical Beast\u2019s physical body was, humans on equivalent levels were not an equal match for Magical Beasts.But who was Long Chen? He had no fear for anyone below the Tendon Transformation realm. He didn\u2019t like to have to owe anything. If he confirmed that this forest god wasn\u2019t some fake swindler, he wanted to pay it back as fast as possible. He also wanted to know just what this god was.Xiao Hua\u2019s grandpa acquiesced and so, Long Chen followed Xiao Hua out of the village on a mountain path.Xiao Hua was very familiar with this area. With a bow and quiver on her back, she would pause to listen to the surroundings every now and then.She would also occasionally go bring Long Chen to check some of the surroundings traps and snares that they had set up to see if they had captured some wild beasts.But there was only disappointment. They checked a dozen snares, but none of them had caught anything.\u201cIt\u2019s so sad that we have no meat. We need meat in order to strengthen our bodies. It\u2019ll get very difficult to hunt without any more\u2026\u201d sighed Xiao Hua.They were hunters, and meat was something that strengthened them. Having gone without any meat for several days, the villagers\u2019 morale had been greatly impacted.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll handle that debt. Since it was because of me, just let me resolve it myself,\u201d laughed Long Chen.Xiao Hua\u2019s expression changed and she angrily retorted, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Your matters are my matters, which are also the village\u2019s matters. How could we let you go face danger alone?\u201dLong Chen smiled and shut his mouth. But he truly did like this village\u2019s ambiance. There was no selfishness, only a peaceful coexistence. Just how luxurious and rare would such an ambiance be in the world of the royal capital where fights and schemes arose every day?This was a beautiful place, but Long Chen couldn\u2019t possibly stay, let alone muddle along to make kids.But his life was saved by the villagers. He had to repay this debt before leaving.\u201cWait a moment.\u201dSuddenly, Xiao Hua stopped. Looking at the footprints on the ground, her expression was completely serious.\u201cA bear has just recently gone past here. Based on the depth and size of the footprint, it should be a matured Burst Bear. It\u2019s definitely longer than three meters and should have passed through just two hours ago based on the color of the soil.\u201dXiao Hua was definitely worthy of being a highly experienced huntress. She was able to tell so much from just a footprint. The Burst Bear was a first rank Magical Beast that was exceptionally berserk, making it extremely hard to deal with.Even if the whole village joined hands, they still wouldn\u2019t dare to handle this Burst Bear. They had the ability to attack the Cliff Leopard because its specialty was in its speed, and its attacking and defensive prowess were not particularly great.As long as they paid attention to its movements and they had enough people, they definitely stood a good chance of killing it.But the Burst Bear was not the same. It specialized in defensive strength and power. No matter how many people they had, it would all be useless.\u201cIt looks like we should make a detour,\u201d determined Xiao Hua.\u201cWhy?\u201d Long Chen didn\u2019t understand.\u201cFool, do you really have to ask? We aren\u2019t a match for the Burst Bear. Even if all the fighters in the village assembled, we still wouldn\u2019t have a high chance of beating it.\u201d\u201cSays who?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you really are trying to piss me off!\u201d Looking at Long Chen\u2019s foolish wooden manner, Xiao Hua was both angered and anxious. But suddenly she thought of something and blinked. \u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking of going to kill the Burst Bear, are you?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dShe was silent for a moment. She immediately thought of when Long Chen had fought with the Cliff Leopard. At that time, Long Chen had been an absolutely unstoppable god in her eyes.And according to her grandpa, Long Chen had already received extremely heavy injuries before meeting the Cliff Leopard, otherwise, he probably would have been able to kill it on his own.Now looking at Long Chen\u2019s current expression, she finally realized that Long Chen might really possess the strength to kill a first rank Magical Beast.\u201cHave you killed a first rank Magical Beast before?\u201d probed Xiao Hua.\u201cNope.\u201d Long Chen shook his head. This was the first time he had gone away from home, and although he had eaten Magical Beast meat several times, those had been defeated by Wilde.But Long Chen muttered inside, Although I haven\u2019t killed a Magical Beast, I\u2019ve slaughtered quite a few Blood Condensation experts.Xiao Hua shook her head. \u201cThen let\u2019s just let it go. Killing a Magical Beast isn\u2019t done just by relying on a high cultivation base or who is stronger. You have to rely on waiting for a good opportunity. Skill and experience are extremely important. Since you haven\u2019t killed a Magical Beast before, we should try to avoid such a risky scenario. Hunters never take such risks; otherwise, it would be the hunter who is turned into the prey.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t take risks? Then what do you call what you did to save me?\u201d laughed Long Chen.\u201cTch, you\u2019re not allowed to ever bring that up!\u201d Her face reddened and she threateningly raised her fist.\u201cHaha, okay. I won\u2019t joke with you anymore. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t risk our lives on a gamble,\u201d said Long Chen firmly.Long Chen no longer had any of his joking mischievous air. Now he was completely serious and gave off a feeling of great confidence and security.She didn\u2019t know why, but seeing him like that immediately caused her to calm down and relax. Even her terrifying impression of the Burst Bear became lighter.With Xiao Hua guiding the both of them with her hunting experience, the two of them followed the tracks for two hours and found a large natural cave.Within that cave, the originally sleeping Burst Bear suddenly opened its eyes, staring at the two people who had invaded his territory.\u201cROAR!\u201dThe Burst Bear suddenly jumped up. Its huge three-meter-tall figure violently charged towards the two of them.Looking at the wildly charging Burst Bear, Xiao Hua turned pale with fright. That was the first time she had ever let herself be so exposed to a Magical Beast. That went against everything she knew as a huntress.But Xiao Hua noticed that Long Chen remained as calm as ever. His gaze was indifferent as he punched out with his right hand.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 Killing With the Wave of a HandPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeIn front of Xiao Hua\u2019s horrified eyes, the enormous Burst Bear charged at Long Chen, swatting at him with a huge bear claw.The Burst Bear\u2019s strongest point was its powerful claws. It could easily crush rock, so a human body would immediately turn to pulp.That was also why the villagers had never dared place any intentions on the Burst Bear. Even their combined forces were unable to severely injure the Burst Bear, while the Burst Bear would be able to kill several of them with a single charge.BANG! Xiao Hua covered her mouth, unable to believe her own eyes.That Burst Bear\u2019s terrifying attack was actually stiffly blocked by Long Chen. Waves of qi scattered and the land shook, but Long Chen didn\u2019t even take a single step back.Although his figure wasn\u2019t imposing, he was able to easily block the huge Burst Bear which was several times his size. The current Long Chen\u2019s hair was dancing in the wind, and he appeared like a god of war.After blocking that Burst Bear with a single fist, Long Chen coldly smiled. If it was below Tendon Transformation, then even the Burst Bear which specialized in violence was still insufficient to even enter his gaze.Long Chen made a few calculations. The Burst Bear\u2019s attack had contained a force of over five tons. An ordinary Qi Condensation cultivator would be crushed to death in a single blow.And even Blood Condensation cultivators would have to reach the mid stage first before just barely being able to block that attack. That was just how terrifying a Magical Beast which specialized in power was.But in front of Long Chen, that attack posed no danger at all. At the same time, Long Chen thought of Wilde. If Wilde were here, he would probably also be able to block it and then wring its neck.Long Chen didn\u2019t waste any more time. Taking advantage of the Burst Bear stumbling in shock, a broadsword appeared in his hands and he slashed down.Blood splattered as Long Chen broadsword slashed right through the Burst Bear\u2019s head. It didn\u2019t even have time to make a single sound as it tumbled to the ground.Xiao Hua blankly watched it all. She felt as if she was dreaming. It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t killed a Magical Beast before, but it was the first time she had seen such an overbearing method.Normally, when the villagers killed Magical Beasts, they had to make ample preparations. They had to set snares and traps and coat all their weapons with poison. To handle a single Magical Beast would require around a month\u2019s preparations.And despite all those preparations, despite gathering the entire village\u2019s power, killing a Magical Beast still had to be done extremely carefully. A single mistake could cost many lives.Yet in front of Long Chen, that incomparably frightening Burst Bear had been taken down effortlessly.\u201cHow do we handle this thing?\u201dOnly when Long Chen asked her a question did Xiao Hua awake from her stupor. Looking at that huge Burst Bear\u2019s corpse, she said, \u201cHow about we directly bring this Magical Beast up in front of the forest god?\u201d\u201cOr how about you keep it to eat, and only once you get some more prey do you offer more sacrifices?\u201d proposed Long Chen.The villagers were surviving only barely on porridge. That was no way to live or even survive in this wilderness. In any case, killing this kind of Magical Beast didn\u2019t require any real effort from him.\u201cWe can\u2019t! We can\u2019t disappoint the forest god\u2019s trust in us. That\u2019s blasphemous.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Long Chen was helpless. Waving his hand, he collected the Burst Bear\u2019s massive corpse into his spatial ring.\u201cYou\u2026 how did you do that? Are you a god?\u201d Xiao Hua looked at Long Chen in astonishment.That giant corpse had disappeared into thin air, and at the same time, she thought of how Long Chen had suddenly summoned his broadsword into his hands at the beginning.When they had brought Long Chen back to the village back then, they had also brought along that broadsword. But it was so heavy that it had required two people to carry.Later, they kept it permanently by Long Chen\u2019s bed. Once he had awoken, Long Chen naturally had collected it. Thinking of that, Xiao Hua was completely bewildered.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cHow am I a god? This is a spatial ring and can easily store objects.\u201dLong Chen rubbed his ring and the Burst Bear\u2019s corpse once more appeared. Xiao Hua enviously looked at Long Chen\u2019s ring, continuously praising it.Obviously, Xiao Hua had never heard of things like spatial rings. Most likely due to how low quality their beast hides and crystal cores were, they were unable to make much money. They were unable to come into contact with expensive items like spatial rings.\u201cXiao Hua, let me give you a present.\u201dLong Chen took out another ring. That ring had been his only harvest from killing Xia Changfeng.Long Chen had looked over what was inside while being chased by Marquis Ying. Other than some money and weapons, the rest was all useless to him.But there had been one good thing inside. There was the manual that Xia Changfeng had won from the auction, Three Style Parting Wind.Within the surrounding empires, Earth class Battle Skills were already the highest rank of Battle Skills available. For Xia Changfeng to be able to obtain such a Battle Skill for just five hundred million gold coins was actually quite lucky.But now that luck wasn\u2019t his, but Long Chen\u2019s. Other than taking out the Three Style Parting Wind, he left everything else inside the ring.\u201cNo, Long Chen, I can\u2019t accept your things.\u201d Seeing Long Chen suddenly hand her a ring, she hastily jumped and refused.\u201cWhy not? Didn\u2019t you say I was your man? You don\u2019t want what your man gives you?\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but joke.Although he was kidding around a bit, he definitely did have a favorable opinion of how kind and lively Xiao Hua was. Although it wasn\u2019t that kind of romantic feeling, he definitely did want to be friends.\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Xiao Hua was obviously a young woman longing for love. She glanced at the ring in his hands with a contradicting expression.She was extremely curious towards this practically divine ring, but she didn\u2019t feel comfortable taking it.\u201cJust take it. Treat it as my gift.\u201d Long Chen placed the ring into her hand. Xiao Hua\u2019s hand was extremely beautiful, however, it had a layer of calluses, another mark of her being a huntress and often drawing a bow.She lowered her completely red head and rubbed the ring in her hand over and over. That was the first time Long Chen had seen Xiao Hua actually show her shy side.\u201cHere, I\u2019ll teach you how to use it. Gather your focus to the spot between your eyebrows and from that spot, focus your mind on within the ring. At the same time, inject a bit of spiritual qi with your other hand\u2026\u201dOrdinary people weren\u2019t able to open spatial rings, but cultivators could do it as long as they had reached the Qi Condensation realm. As long as they could use their qi and combine it with Spiritual Strength, they would be able to open it.But Xiao Hua didn\u2019t understand the slightest thing about Spiritual Strength. She needed Long Chen to guide her step by step. What surprised Long Chen was that Xiao Hua was extremely smart and quickly comprehended the method in just a few tries.This made him shake his head inside. If Wilde had just half of Xiao Hua\u2019s smarts, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much about him.Thinking of Wilde, Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but become anxious. He didn\u2019t know if Wilde had brought Little Snow back to the capital.But according to Long Chen\u2019s calculations, having held up Marquis Ying, there was no one who would recognize Wilde. It was highly likely that he would be able to return to the capital.As long as he did and then went to ask grandmaster Yun Qi for help, that would shield the Long household from dangers. But plans could never be completely perfect. He also had to quickly return to the capital.Of course, before that, he still had to complete two things. One of which was to repay the village\u2019s debt, otherwise, with their guileless natures, if they really did go try killing a second rank Magical Beast, who knew how many of them would die.And secondly, he had to increase his cultivation base. His fight with Marquis Ying had made him realize that he was still lacking. In front of a Tendon Transformation expert, he was powerless to resist. Such a feeling was not one he wanted to feel a second time.\u201cAh, so much stuff!\u201d Xiao Hua finally managed to open the spatial ring and saw what was inside.Inside was a space over ten meters wide. There was a mountain of golden coins along with many weapons that shined coldly.It was the first time she had seen such fine weapons. And as for the gold coins, she didn\u2019t have any shock towards them because she didn\u2019t even recognize what they were.They would only ever send anyone out of the village once every now and then. That journey required half a month to reach a distant town. They would exchange crystal cores and hides for the metal instruments, food and other provisions they needed. They never actually touched money.As for the coldly shining weapons, only they were truly interesting to Xiao Hua who was a huntress. She almost fainted from joy when she saw those excellent weapons.\u201cSpiritual qi is required to open the ring. If you want to take things out or put things in, then you need to use your Spiritual Strength. Try it.\u201d Long Chen laughed at her excitement.\u201cOkay.\u201d Xiao Hua tried using her Spiritual Strength several times without succeeding. One reason was because her Spiritual Strength was too weak. Not all people had such vigorous Spiritual Strength like alchemists.And for another, Xiao Hua was a complete amateur at using Spiritual Strength. Trying to use it was an exceptionally laborious task. That had long since been expected by Long Chen and he didn\u2019t rush her. He continuously encouraged her.If she could use the spatial ring properly, then the weapons inside would allow the entire village\u2019s strength to rise to another level. It would definitely reduce the casualties of the hunters.Plus, they would find it much more convenient whenever they had to go out of the village.In the time it took for an incense stick to burn, Xiao Hua finally managed to use her Spiritual Strength to take a weapon out of the spatial ring. But due to her lack of control, she was unable to control where it appeared and it fell to the ground.\u201cWow! Excellent, I can use this divine ring!\u201dXiao Hua picked up the sword with one hand and hugged Long Chen with the other excitedly.\u201cHey, be careful. You almost ran me through with your sword!\u201d Long Chen laughed bitterly.She was unable to control her excitement, and she chopped the new sword in her hand at a tree around the thickness of an arm.With a clean sound, the sword effortlessly chopped through the tree. Its sharpness caused Xiao Hua to exclaim in excitement. The weapons, which they exchanged for in the town where they went to, were unable to compare to such a fine weapon.Seeing that she had learned the initial ways to use it, Long Chen helped her to take out a spear. To hunters, spears were definitely more useful than swords.The two of them continued traveling forward when they suddenly ran into a wild boar. It looked to be over a ton. Perhaps the two of them had walked into its territory since it was now attacking them.Xiao Hua stabbed at it with her spear. The sharpness of the spear made it seem like the boar was made of tofu. Her spear punctured right through the boar\u2019s tough hide, pierced its heart, and came out through the other side of its body.Xiao Hua was incomparably excited. She had been able to bring down a matured wild boar in just a single blow. That was an incredibly great accomplishment to her.The two of them hurried along their journey. On the midday of the next day, the two of them finally arrived beside a certain pond with an enormous tree beside it.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It practically covered the entire mountain top. In front of the huge tree, whose trunk was hundreds of meters wide, was a small pond with incredibly clear water.There was also a stone platform that had been created by man. It was obviously a sacrificial altar constructed by the village\u2019s ancestors.When he looked at that immense tree, Long Chen sensed an incredibly strong vitality as well as a majestic and boundless natural energy. It seemed as if this huge tree contained the entire natural will of the world. It was extremely stunning.\u201cThis is your forest god?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cYes, this is our forest god. You should pay your respects with me. It is the one who really saved your life.\u201d After saying that, Xiao Hua reverently kneeled down and kowtowed.Long Chen looked at this huge tree. It was this tree which had saved him. Since no one had given him any medicinal pills after he had fainted, he probably would have burnt up all his energy and eventually have died. To pay respects to the one who had saved him was acceptable.Just as Long Chen was about to get on his knees, a soft voice rang over, a voice that made them feel like they were being cleansed by spring wind.\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be like this. I\u2019m unable to accept such a thing.\u201dSuddenly, a figure appeared atop the sacrificial altar. It was a female figure in a white dress. Her black hair fell to her waist, giving people a fluttering immortal feeling. However, her figure was extremely fuzzy and her features couldn\u2019t be seen clearly.\u201cForest god.\u201d Xiao Hua who was kneeling on the ground looked up in shock. She had once heard the forest god\u2019s voice before, but she had never seen it take form.Not only her, but even in all the village\u2019s history, there was not a single person who had ever seen the forest god take form.But as soon as Long Chen arrived and before he even knelt, it immediately appeared before him. And furthermore, it even implied it was not worthy of Long Chen\u2019s reverence. Xiao Hua became dizzy. Even a god was unworthy of Long Chen\u2019s worship?Long Chen was filled with astonishment as he looked at that figure. He knew that this figure wasn\u2019t human, but a soul.That was something that could only form when one\u2019s Spiritual Strength reached a kind of pinnacle. Long Chen was extremely proud of his powerful soul, but in front of the forest god, he was just like a small stream in front of a huge ocean. This was the first time he had ever felt himself to be so minute.\u201cYou are the forest god?\u201d Long Chen asked probingly.That woman smiled slightly and didn\u2019t reply. Looking at the kneeling Xiao Hua, she gently said, \u201cSleep for a while.\u201dXiao Hua immediately rolled over to the ground, falling into a deep slumber.Long Chen was startled. What a powerful technique. Even without using spiritual energy, just her will was able to make people fall asleep.Only then did she turn to Long Chen. \u201cThe words we speak between us aren\u2019t suitable for her to hear, so I could only let her sleep for a while. I am no god. That was simply what they called me. The truth is that I am not from this world.\u201d\u201cNot from this world?\u201d Long Chen was greatly startled.\u201cI come from the distant Spirit World. To the current you, that is still extremely far. But I know that with your talent, it won\u2019t be long before you reach it,\u201d said that woman.Her words caused Long Chen\u2019s heart to pound wildly. He knew this forest god was definitely a frighteningly powerful existence, but she actually refused to explain just what this Spirit World was.Spirit World\u2026 that was a term that Long Chen was completely unfamiliar with. But when he heard it, he had a kind of deja vu feeling. That was an extremely vague and profound feeling.Seeing that she didn\u2019t continue explaining, Long Chen didn\u2019t interrogate her. He cupped his fists. \u201cLong Chen will engrave the favor of saving my life into my memory.\u201d\u201cActually you don\u2019t need to thank me. You should thank those villagers. According to our agreement, no matter what they needed, I would need to meet their demands. At the same time, I also have to put out an equivalent price. This was our agreement, so you don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201d She shook her head.\u201cI wonder whether I can ask why you would make such an agreement with ordinary villagers?\u201d asked Long Chen.This was a question Long Chen had wondered for a long time. This was like a huge elephant making an agreement with a group of ants. It didn\u2019t make sense.She was silent for a while before replying, \u201cBecause I need their help.\u201d\u201cTheir help?\u201d Long Chen didn\u2019t understand. A terrifyingly powerful existence like this actually required the help of ordinary villagers?\u201cI said that I am not of this world. Due to an intense battle, a crack appeared in time and space, sweeping me away. Originally, I should have died. Although I just managed to survive by luck, my body suffered extremely heavy wounds. After a long time of recovery, my body gradually healed.\u201cBut if I want to return to my world, I need to sacrifice a great deal of blood. I need to accumulate enough fleshly power in order to open a spacetime channel and return to my original world. You must be curious as to why I don\u2019t personally hunt myself and rely on their hands,\u201d she said.Long Chen nodded. That was the most obvious inconsistency. It seemed needless for her to rely on the villagers.\u201cThat\u2019s because my spirit race has its own restrictions. We can\u2019t go kill others for our own needs. We can\u2019t personally end lives.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cThis has to do with the secret cultivation technique of my spirit race. If I personally kill anything, absorbing its flesh will cause me to also absorb its resentment at being killed. That is a kind of unresolvable poison to us,\u201d she explained.Although Long Chen felt a bit out of his depths when talking to this white-dressed woman, he supposed he now understood a bit of why she would make such an agreement with Xiao Hua\u2019s ancestors.\u201cYou are someone with limitless potential. This time, your meridians were extremely injured. I didn\u2019t only heal them, I also expanded them a bit. I also used my core energy to increase your meridians\u2019 toughness. So your medical expenses were a bit higher.\u201dLong Chen was surprised. After awakening, he had sensed that his body seemed to have changed a bit, but he hadn\u2019t figured out just what kind of change it was.Now that she brought it up, he quickly examined his meridians and went wild with joy. His meridians had actually become over twice as wide as they had been before.And most importantly, his meridians which were like glass tubes before had changed to become like flexible tubing. Such meridians could endure a much greater amount of spiritual energy without bursting.That was a huge surprise. If the current him fought with Marquis Ying once more, his meridians would definitely not crack again. At that time, he would definitely be able to kill him.\u201cMany thanks.\u201d Long Chen was completely sincere. Thinking back to how angry he had been when he had first heard of this sacrificial offer, he couldn\u2019t help but feel ashamed of himself.She shook her head. \u201cAs someone from the spirit race, I was only following the agreement. So you don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201dLong Chen laughed. \u201cLet me ask you this: if I were to slip away after you cured me, what would you do?\u201dThat female figure seemed to laugh and shook her head. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. Members of my spirit race are extremely sensitive when it comes to other people\u2019s hearts. If you were a wicked person, I would have been able to sense it immediately and absolutely wouldn\u2019t have saved you. And even if you left, there would be others to pay back the debt. But in that case, I would forgive that debt and the previous agreement would be void.\u201d\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t you suffer a loss?\u201d smiled Long Chen.\u201cIt can be considered so. But it would be of no matter. This is the rule of my spirit race. The agreement must be followed according to that initial premise.\u201d\u201cLike with the village\u2019s ancestors?\u201d Long Chen suddenly thought of the story Xiao Hua had told him.\u201cYes, that is our custom.\u201dSuch a custom was definitely a good one, but within the world of the royal capital, such a thing would guarantee that you would suffer great losses. Long Chen sighed inside.This was an agreement based on good faith, an agreement based on the heart. It was definitely much more effective than any signed contract. The most assured agreement was one that was on the spiritual level.Long Chen began to feel profound respect for this woman from the so-called Spirit World. She was a pure and innocent soul that had yet to be contaminated by the mundane world.\u201cRight, how much more Magical Beast flesh do you still require here?\u201d Long Chen took out the Burst Bear\u2019s corpse and threw it onto the ground.Suddenly, countless roots tore out of the ground and dug their way into the Burst Bear\u2019s corpse. In less than a breath\u2019s time, the corpse was sucked dry. Even its bones were sucked away, leaving behind only a couple pieces of skin.After that Burst Bear was sucked dry, Long Chen was startled to sense that the huge tree\u2019s vitality grew even stronger, and its leaves seemed to have become much more spiritual.\u201cIn order to heal you, I injured my core. I need ten first rank Magical Beasts and one second rank Magical Beast before being able to heal,\u201d replied the white-robed woman.\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t you have made no profit?\u201d Long Chen was a bit flabbergasted.She lightly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s still the same as what I said before. That was the agreement set up at the beginning.\u201d\u201cI understand. But I, Long Chen, am not someone who likes owing others. Having received such a great favor from you, I will definitely remember it,\u201d nodded Long Chen.He didn\u2019t want to owe others favors. But if someone did help him, he would repay that favor back ten times. Just like how fatty Yu and the others had only helped him out at the beginning by lending him a bit of money, but Long Chen would remember that favor forever.His meridians had been broadened now, and whether it was to his future cultivation or his use of Battle Skills, it was an enormous benefit. Such a favor was incredibly enormous.After talking to the forest god, Long Chen gently woke up Xiao Hua. They left the area of the forest god and returned to the village.After arriving, Xiao Hua excitedly gathered everyone and showed them the wild boar she had killed, as well as telling them about how Long Chen had easily killed a Burst Bear and how the forest god had taken form in front of them. Everyone stared at her with wide eyes.The most shocking thing was that the forest god had taken shape in front of them. After hearing that, all the villagers knelt down towards the distant direction of the forest divinity.Because of the agreement between Long Chen and the forest divinity, the forest divinity had given them an allowance on their debt. That very night, everyone celebrated with a large serving of wild boar meat.Xiao Hua then showed everyone her new spatial ring. She took out the weapons within it one by one, causing everyone in the village to become incomparably excited.After eating, Long Chen disappeared into the night alone. There was one thing that he absolutely had to do.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 Heavenly PunishmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeCovered by the darkness of night, Long Chen climbed to the peak of a mountain. The bright moon hung high above, lighting up his surroundings so that he could see the scenery hundreds of miles around.At this time, Long Chen no longer had to be as worried as he had been while being chased by Marquis Ying. This was an exceptionally good spot for him to cultivate.Within this primal forest, the spiritual qi in the air was several times greater than in the capital. He needed to borrow that advantage to advance to another level.Ever since he had run into Marquis Ying after killing Xia Changfeng, he had repeatedly fought on the brink of death. Long Chen\u2019s resolution had actually greatly advanced from that.He could feel that a certain bottleneck was starting to weaken. This was his best opportunity to attack the next realm.The peak of the mountain top could only be reached by climbing up extremely steep cliffs, so he had no need to fear any beasts disturbing him. Sitting cross-legged atop a boulder, his twelve cyclones began to revolve.Space trembled and twelve huge vortexes appeared behind his body, growing to a terrifying size of three hundred meters.This was the first time Long Chen had fully summoned his cyclones outside his body since arriving past the tenth Heavenstage.That was because he had been afraid that this oddity would have alarmed his opponents. It was unheard of for someone to possess ten or more cyclones in Qi Condensation. But in this place, he finally had free rein to use his full power to absorb heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi.Those twelve huge cyclones were like twelve gaping maws, like whales drinking in water, greedily absorbing spiritual qi and sending it to Long Chen\u2019s FengFu Star.Space started to warp as all the spiritual qi within hundreds of miles began to gather towards Long Chen, practically so dense that it could be seen with the physical eye.BOOM!In just six hours, Long Chen\u2019s FengFu Star emitted an explosive sound. That was because his spiritual qi had reached a critical boundary, a sign that he was about to enter the next realm.But Long Chen still wasn\u2019t the slightest bit excited because he knew that this was just the start. There was still a long process which he had to work his hardest to get through.Back when he had condensed his tenth cyclone, he had experienced the trouble of being \u2018close\u2019 to advancing. He was already used to how unorthodox the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was.For most martial artists, advancing would only require breaking past a single barrier, which was often thought of as breaking out from a single pair of \u2018shackles\u2019. Extremely talented people might have to break through multiple shackles. But no matter how talented someone was, to break through out of Qi Condensation would definitely never require breaking out of more than nine shackles.However, when Long Chen had broken through to the tenth Heavenstage, although he hadn\u2019t been counting, he was sure that he had long since surpassed a thousand shackles.The next two times he had broken through, Long Chen hadn\u2019t even bothered remembering how many barriers he had had to break through of. In any case, it was just a continuous charge by him until he finally broke through.So when his FengFu Star emitted this first sound, Long Chen wasn\u2019t excited at all. He simply continued absorbing energy.More and more energy began to pour into his FengFu Star. It began to quickly circulate, at the same time, emitting continuous explosions.Long Chen didn\u2019t bother with that. He simply did his best to absorb more and more energy. Clouds and winds gathered around him. All the energy in the vicinity charged towards him.Hundreds of miles away from Long Chen was an enormous tree. At the top of the tree was the forest god\u2019s white-dressed figure which was now watching him.\u201cWhat a powerful foundational aura. It looks like the human race will gain another astounding figure.\u201d After muttering that, her figure faded away.Long Chen\u2019s FengFu Star was incessantly trembling. This wasn\u2019t out of Long Chen\u2019s expectations.This continued for three full days. Long Chen\u2019s FengFu Star was beginning to circulate slower, and in the end, it completely paused. Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but celebrate. This was the true sign he was about to make a breakthrough.BOOM!Suddenly, heaven and earth trembled. The twelve cyclones behind Long Chen slowly separated, revealing a thirteenth cyclone amongst them.When this thirteenth cyclone appeared, the originally sunny and cloudless sky immediately turned dark with pitch-black clouds. Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed. Everything within thousands of miles went completely dark.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Long Chen was completely horrified. He realized that all those black clouds were like a huge whirlpool, and the whirlpool\u2019s center was right above himself!It looked nothing more than a huge demonic eye focusing expressionlessly on him. At the same time, a terrifying destructive will pushed down upon him.Long Chen immediately realized that he was unable to move an inch. He was unable to even bat his eyes.He wildly cursed inside as he saw more and more black clouds gather in the sky. The lightning within the sky gradually converged at the center of the black clouds.\u201cIs it going to strike me?!\u201d Even if Long Chen was stupid, he would still be able to predict what was about to happen. He madly struggled.But it was as if his whole body was being pressed by a huge mountain. Despite his best efforts, his body merely trembled continuously.The huge boulder beneath his foot cracked. Such a sturdy boulder was actually unable to bear the pressure.Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but tremble in fear. He tried running, but he felt as if a whole mountain was crushing him from every direction. He was only able to make very limited movements and was simply unable to flee.\u201cThis is heavenly punishment. You are unable to flee. Gather your full strength to resist.\u201dAs Long Chen was wildly cursing inside and was incredibly anxious, a voice suddenly rang in Long Chen\u2019s ears.\u201cForest god?\u201d Long Chen immediately recognized that voice. But heavenly punishment? He was infuriated. How many evil people existed in the world, and yet the heavens decided to punish him?!Hearing that voice, it seemed the forest god knew the origin of this terrifying heavenly punishment. Since she had given him a warning, she definitely wasn\u2019t trying to hurt him.Putting away his anger, he rubbed his ring and his broadsword appeared in his hands. He pushed his power to its peak.The thirteen cyclones revolved around Long Chen as a halo of light enveloped him. It was as if a god from the heavens had reincarnated within him and was disdainfully looking up at the sky.The forest god saw the thirteen cyclones and the halo of light from the distance. She was deep in thought.Long Chen pushed his thirteen cyclones to the max. Energy from heaven and earth was continuously streaming into his body. Now that his meridians had been transformed by the forest god, he was able to control an even greater amount of energy.The black clouds in the sky were becoming increasingly thick, and the lightning was becoming more and more concentrated.Suddenly, the sky became completely silent. A bolt of lightning several feet wide shot straight down from the center of the black clouds towards Long Chen, its power seeming to want to destroy the heavens and exterminate the earth.Long Chen watched as that terrifying lightning bolt descended. He felt an endless destructive will coming from it. Raising his broadsword with both hands, a strange light appeared over his sword.\u201cSplit the Heavens!\u201dBOOM!The mountain peak which was hundreds of meters tall was destroyed. Rocks crumbled as that one lightning bolt completely flattened the mountain.Long Chen vomited three consecutive mouthfuls of blood. His body was charred all over, and he could even smell his own flesh roasting.His full force blow was like an ant waving its antenna in front of an elephant. He was unable to shake that lightning bolt in the slightest. He had been essentially powerless.This made him feel completely dispirited. In front of that lightning, he felt that he was completely insignificant. His joy from advancing to the thirteenth Heavenstage was immediately extinguished.\u201cYou did very well.\u201dThe sky once more returned to its sunny state as the black clouds scattered. It was as if everything before had been just an illusion. The white-robed woman appeared in front of Long Chen.Long Chen was about to say something when he once more vomited more blood. That thunderbolt had greatly shaken his internal organs.The forest god waved her hand and a drop of green liquid came from her body and fell into Long Chen\u2019s mouth. Long Chen only managed to sense that it tasted sweet before it quickly slid down his throat and rapidly spread throughout his body. His wounds began to quickly heal.The black burnt parts of his skin slowly fell off. In less than the time it took for an incense stick to burn, his body had recovered eighty to ninety percent. This was much more miraculous than any healing pills!\u201cNo need to be surprised. The first heavenly punishment is mostly focused on destroying your will. If your will wasn\u2019t sturdy enough, your mind and soul would have been exterminated by the heavenly punishment,\u201d explained the forest god.\u201cWhat is this heavenly punishment?\u201d asked Long Chen.\u201cIt is the will of the Heavenly Daos. Anyone that can threaten the Heavenly Daos will attract its punishment when advancing.\u201dThreaten the Heavenly Daos? Could that be pointing to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art?\u201cThere are some things that I can\u2019t tell you too much about, or it wouldn\u2019t be beneficial to you. Rest a while and consolidate your cultivation base. I will be returning.\u201dWithout waiting for Long Chen\u2019s response, her figure turned into a wisp of mist, slowly disappearing in front of Long Chen\u2019s eyes.Seeing her disappear, then looking at the flattened mountain peak, and then looking towards the completely cloudless sky, Long Chen felt as if he had been dreaming.Thinking back to that bolt of lightning, Long Chen shivered. That lightning bolt was something he had been completely unable to resist. Why hadn\u2019t it killed him?Then was it really as that woman had said, and the first heavenly punishment only tested his will? If his will had broken down, he would have been destroyed beneath that heavenly punishment?That heavenly punishment had released an unstoppable aura. He had been trying to flee originally, and it was only with the forest god\u2019s warning that he had dared to face the heavenly punishment head-on.Without her warning, perhaps he would have already been exterminated in both body and soul. Lingering fear filled him.At the same time, he also understood just how important a powerful will was for martial cultivators. Cultivation was fundamentally a path of no retreat.He took a deep breath. With the forest god\u2019s warning, it seemed as if he was seeing an even vaster world unfurling before him.Space trembled as Long Chen returned his thirteen cyclones into his body. He wanted to clearly test whether his cyclones had changed.Long Chen noticed that they hadn\u2019t grown any larger. But what amazed him was that after the heavenly punishment, there was now a link between all thirteen cyclones. They were completely tied together.Now the thirteen cyclones had a ring of light connecting them. They were no longer independent but had formed a single entity. Spiritual qi flowed throughout it.Under Long Chen\u2019s control, the ring of light, which was really his thirteen cyclones, lightly trembled and began to quickly revolve. The ring of light spun around, forming a huge whirlpool that madly absorbed heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual qi.The absorption speed was at least ten times greater than before. Even if Long Chen fought a powerful enemy again, he would not have to worry about running out of spiritual qi like before.Back when he had fought alongside Wilde against Marquis Ying, it was precisely because the consumption had been too great that he had run out of spiritual qi, making it so he was unable to continue fighting. Now that his thirteen cyclones had linked together, he would basically never have to worry about that problem again.Furthermore, he also noticed that when the mysterious ring had connected his thirteen cyclones, another thing had appeared in his body which was filling him with strength.Slowly closing his eyes and examining his body, Long Chen suddenly shook and went crazy with joy.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 Three Style Parting WindPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeWhen he slowly closed his eyes and examined his body, he realized that spiritual qi had appeared within his blood. Although it was very faint, he was sure that it was present.\u201cI\u2019ve entered the Blood Condensation realm?\u201cSo after reaching the thirteenth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation by using the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, you will automatically enter Blood Condensation.\u201dThe Blood Condensation realm was the point where the spiritual qi in the body had been condensed to a pinnacle. Spiritual qi would be scattered throughout the blood, purifying the blood of its impurities, returning it to its true essence.With such pure blood nourishing the body, the physical body would become much stronger and one\u2019s strength would multiply.Having entered the Blood Condensation realm, Long Chen was so excited that he almost cried. Although, at this point, he still didn\u2019t feel his body immediately becoming stronger.But as long as the impurities in his blood were incessantly purified by his spiritual qi, his strength would quickly rise.And in any case, what the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art cultivated was the physical body. Now that he had entered the Blood Condensation realm, he would even be able to pose a threat to Marquis Ying who was at the Tendon Transformation realm.Blood condensation was something that couldn\u2019t be rushed. Since Long Chen had thirteen enormous cyclones, he didn\u2019t need to deliberately focus on it to purify his blood. That meant his cultivation speed would be a dozen times faster than ordinary people.What Long Chen wanted to do now wasn\u2019t to condense his blood, but to increase his actual strength. A Battle Skill appeared in his hand. Long Chen smiled. It was time to see just how powerful an Earth class Battle Skill was.This was the first Earth class Battle Skill Long Chen had ever obtained. Thinking back to the terrifying moves Marquis Ying had displayed, he was filled with a burning passion.To Long Chen who lacked Battle Skills, this particular Battle Skill had come at an extremely opportune time. Speaking of which, he should really thank Xia Changfeng.He opened the Battle Skill and carefully read over it. His expression became a bit strange. He originally thought that the Three Style Parting Wind had three different moves.But as he read, he realized that it was just one move which had three variations. They were split into the Parting Wind Slash, Parting Wind Slice, and Parting Wind Stab.The principles behind them were the exact same. It was just the final use of it that was different, making it \u2018three styles\u2019. It truly was deceptive.Thinking back to how Yao Niqian had sold it back then and how she had acted as if it was completely unique and amazing, he was completely speechless and felt cheated.According to this model, this Three Style Parting Wind could easily become Nine Styles. Parting Wind Chop, Parting Wind Thrust, even Parting Wind Swat\u2026 there could be as many \u2018styles\u2019 as you wanted.Although he was a bit disappointed, Long Chen wasn\u2019t a person who didn\u2019t know how to be content with what he had. After all, he had obtained it without spending a single cent. The person who should be depressed about it should have been Xia Changfeng.Reading through the Three Style Parting Wind\u2019s usage of spiritual qi, Long Chen found out that it only used six acupuncture points. That was much inferior to the nine points required by Split the Heavens.Each time the spiritual qi passed through an acupuncture point, it would require even greater control. It would be much more difficult with each point, but the power would also multiply drastically.Originally, Long Chen had thought that Split the Heavens was a low grade Earth class Battle Skill, but now that he compared it to the Three Style Parting Wind, its difficulty was clearly much greater.Wouldn\u2019t that mean that Split the Heavens was at least in the mid grade Earth class, and perhaps even high grade Earth class?No wonder Split the Heavens was so terrifying that he had been unable to control it!He had used Split the Heavens against Marquis Ying before, but Long Chen knew that his usage was not the complete form.He did not dare use its full strength because his meridians weren\u2019t able to endure it. He also felt that even if he activated his FengFu Star to its peak, he would still be unable to fulfill Split the Heaven\u2019s true requirements.Split the Heavens was just like a bottomless pit. He was still far from being able to use its true power. Perhaps he had accidentally picked up a true treasure.Long Chen\u2019s sword whistled through the air and a wave of qi shot out, slashing apart a shrub ten meters away.\u201cIt actually contains the wind\u2019s force. Is this Sword Qi?\u201dLong Chen finally understood why this Earth class Battle Skill was called the Three Style Parting Wind. It actually was a wind-attribute Battle Skill.Most Battle Skills used the superposition of multiple acupuncture points to increase the physical body\u2019s strength, similar to how Marquis Ying had used his Battle Skill. Although that was powerful, it didn\u2019t have any attribute.The human body was just like a treasure trove of hidden treasures. Through continuous excavation, one could find endless hidden potential.For example, Meng Qi used her powerful Spiritual Strength to control Magical Beasts. She could use her Spiritual Strength to open up space just like a spatial ring to store her housepets.For example, pill cultivators used the physical body\u2019s strength to condense a Pill Flame. Their flame\u2019s potential was endless, capable of destruction and also of merging heaven and earth\u2019s various treasures into medicinal pills.For example, martial artists condensed qi and blood, tempered their muscles and bones, forging their originally frail bodies into bodies that were even more powerful than Magical Beasts.All of these stemmed from the human body. The human body was filled with unknown mysteries. By following the methods that former generations left behind, people could strive to unlock their own hidden potential.As for the Three Style Parting Wind, by running spiritual qi through six specific acupuncture points, it could actually release spiritual qi outside the body to form an astral wind.The fact that Long Chen could summon an astral wind to blow apart a shrub ten meters away with just his initial comprehension of the Battle Skill was definitely a pleasant surprise to him.Long Chen\u2019s Pill God memories contained the exact routes of his meridians and locations of his acupuncture points, making it so that he was basically able to use a Battle Skill as soon as he learned it.However, this didn\u2019t mean he would be a master at it immediately. Using various Battle Skills required constant adaptation to find the best tempo and rhythm. Only then could he display its peak strength. That required constant testing and practice in order to do.But even so, Long Chen\u2019s cultivation speed was absolutely shocking. Even a Tendon Transformation expert like Marquis Ying would require several months of comprehension and practice just to be able to use an Earth class Battle Skill, and if he wanted to have a complete mastery of it, that would require years.Although Long Chen couldn\u2019t master it immediately, he was still able to gain an initial mastery in the Three Style Parting Wind due to his complete understanding of the meridians.With his experience in cultivating Split the Heavens which required nine acupuncture points, the Three Style Parting Wind was much easier.Furthermore, after obtaining the forest god\u2019s help, his meridians had doubled in width and were much tougher. He was absolutely able to control an Earth class Battle Skill that normally only Tendon Transformation experts were capable of using.The Three Style Parting Wind was actually just one move with three variations, split into a slash, slice, and stab.The method of circulating spiritual qi in the body was the same for all three variations. It was only when the spiritual qi left the body that the method from which it entered the weapon was different. That was why Long Chen felt he would be able to change it into the Nine Style Parting Wind and perhaps sell it for an even higher price.After testing it several times and becoming familiar with the meridians used, Long Chen paused his training of it and returned to the village.He had truly advanced a great deal this time. He had broken through to the Blood Condensation realm, and his thirteen cyclones had joined together to form a divine ring. In the future, he would be able to summon it out and fight with his full strength.He had been unable to do that when he had ten to twelve cyclones for fear of others being shocked by his anomaly. But the new divine ring was something that no one would guess was made of thirteen cyclones. They would only be able to assume that it was some supplementary Battle Skill.The world of cultivation was boundless and there were countless Daos. Cultivation techniques and Battle Skills were as numerous as grains of sand. All kinds of rare and strange Battle Skills existed. As long as you didn\u2019t ostentatiously show it off, rare Battle Skills wouldn\u2019t cause too much of a ripple.With the assistance of that divine ring, he would not only be capable of rising to another level when fighting, but he would have tremendous vitality. With it continuously absorbing spiritual qi and adding on how much spiritual qi could be stored in his FengFu Star, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about running out of spiritual qi again.Now Long Chen couldn\u2019t wait to fight against Marquis Ying again. Back then he had been forced into despair by Marquis Ying. if Xiao Hua hadn\u2019t saved him, he would already be food for a Magical Beast.At the same time, Long Chen felt even more anxious. He didn\u2019t know just what was happening within the capital. He also didn\u2019t know whether his father had set any plans into motion after receiving his letter.Although he was extremely worried, Long Chen still had something he had to do first. That was to repay his debt to the forest god.After meeting the forest god who had come from the Spirit World, Long Chen felt as if he had managed to peek into a new, vaster world.At the same time, that also ignited his passions. The world was so marvelous. The current him who was stuck in a small place like the Phoenix Cry Empire was nothing more than a frog at the bottom of a well.He was now even more impatient to resolve the matters of the capital. He wanted to bring Chu Yao out to see the world. He wanted to see Bai Ling\u2019s Huayun Sect, Meng Qi\u2019s Wind Spirit Pavilion, and grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s Pill Valley which was a divine, holy land in the hearts of pill cultivators.The world was just too big. He had to go out to see it. But before that, he had to resolve his matters.The enmity of stealing his Spirit Blood, Spirit Bone, and Spirit Root still had to be revenged. Otherwise, what was the point of cultivation? He had already placed most of his suspicions on Marquis Ying.However, he still wasn\u2019t completely sure it was him, and he also didn\u2019t know why he would do such a thing. Was it because someone had ordered him to? And if so, who?The fourth prince was only in his twenties at this time, so he would still have been a child at the time when his ability to cultivate had been stolen. So it probably wasn\u2019t the fourth prince who had ordered Marquis Ying to do this.He shook his head and placed those thoughts aside. Wondering about such things was useless. The fact that Marquis Ying had come to kill him this time meant that whatever plot they had been brewing for so long was finally ready and they no longer had any misgivings. A huge event was about to explode, and the truth would quickly become evident.What Long Chen needed to do was to increase his strength as much as possible before that final, critical moment. Only then could he protect his family.He had sent medicinal pills to help his father, but if the people beside him were only of ordinary talent, the chance of them breaking through was not high.The main target of the hidden scheme against the Long family was Long Tianxiao. Long Chen was just a minor character.Just to handle a minor character like him, they had sent a powerful figure like Marquis Ying. Then in order to handle his father, they would definitely use an even more overbearing method.And so, he didn\u2019t hope for any help from his father\u2019s side. All he hoped for was that those pills he had sent could help his father survive the approaching danger.As for the capital, he would have to rely on himself. So he was extremely pressed and couldn\u2019t waste even the slightest bit of time.He rushed back quickly towards the village. In order to not to alarm the villagers, he had run out quite far.He needed to talk to Xiao Hua about the village\u2019s surroundings. It would be best if there were a couple of strong Magical Beasts around. He trusted that the people who had lived here for hundreds of years would have the best understanding of the area.Despite rushing for over four hours, Long Chen didn\u2019t feel the slightest fatigue. Instead, he was feeling stronger and stronger, the gradual result of advancing into Blood Condensation. His speed only continued to increase, and he was like a wisp of smoke that shot to the village, leaving behind a long trail of dust and leaves.As Long Chen approached the village, he gradually slowed down. As soon as he walked into the village, he suddenly heard an angry roar.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 Little Snows ReturnPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeAll the villagers had gathered together, most of them carrying spears. They were all nervously on guard against a certain thing in front of them.That was a meter long small wolf. It looked just like an ordinary ferocious dog, but its whole body was emitting a vicious aura that caused people to tremble in fear.Its eyes were especially filled with a cold, bloodthirsty light that caused those hunters who even often killed Magical Beasts to feel extremely terrified.Originally, everyone had just been resting when all the babies suddenly began to let out terrified cries that drew everyone\u2019s attention.When they looked around and saw this small wolf, they were all given a fright. Their village walls were covered in poisonous thorns. Magical Beasts had an innate fear of such things and they wouldn\u2019t force their way in.But this Magical Beast had charged through, raising everyone\u2019s guard. They were all ready to attack it.\u201cStop!\u201dLong Chen was like a gale of wind as he suddenly burst on the scene and actually hugged that incomparably vicious Magical Beast.He couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes. It was Little Snow!Little Snow was covered in blood and mud. Dozens of wounds covered all over his body and some of them were still bleeding while some areas had even been cut all the way down to the bone.\u201cWu wu\u2026\u201d When Little Snow saw Long Chen, the vicious aura around him immediately disappeared without a trace, instead becoming tender and warm. He rubbed his head over Long Chen\u2019s face over and over.But as for the villagers, when they saw him suddenly hug a dangerous Magical Beast, they all turned pale with fright.That was a Magical Beast! To be wild and vicious was in their nature! Even a young Magical Beast was many times more powerful than an ordinary wild beast.Now they were all dumbstruck as they watched this. How was that a Magical Beast? It seemed more like a puppy!\u201cLittle Snow, you\u2019ve suffered.\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel emotional when he saw all the wounds on Little Snow.Perhaps Wilde had forgotten Little Snow, or perhaps Little Snow had secretly run out on his own. In any case, he had relied on his wolf nose to find his trail.But his trail was a thousand miles away in a remote area with countless wild beasts roving around. Little Snow had clearly run into dangerous situations many times.Little Snow was now three times larger than he was before. By relying on himself to hunt wild beasts, he had managed to grow stronger.\u201cWu wu\u2026\u201d Little Snow continuously rubbed against Long Chen, actually trying to comfort him. Long Chen knew this because of the slight connection between their souls.That made him feel even more guilty. He picked up Little Snow and introduced him to everyone as his housepet, and only then did everyone calm down.Long Chen carried Little Snow into his room and carefully examined Little Snow\u2019s wounds. Some were teeth injuries from where he had been bitten by wild beasts. One of his feet was swollen greatly and there was a scent of rot coming from it. Long Chen looked at it and saw that there were two small pricks.He suspected that it was from some sort of poisonous bite. Luckily, Little Snow\u2019s physique was strong and able to block that poison. An ordinary wild beast would probably have long since let out its final death cry.Long Chen brought Little Snow over to a basin of clean drinking water. He dissolved a medicinal pill within the water first before washing Little Snow\u2019s wounds.There were simply too many open wounds and some places had become inflamed. Even more importantly, there was a part of his flesh at the bottom of his foot that had rotted and needed to be cut off.Xiao Hua couldn\u2019t help but feel her skin crawl when she saw Long Chen cleaning Little Snow\u2019s wounds. That was especially the case when she saw him actually bring a knife to cut off some parts of his foot.Little Snow\u2019s head was perfectly placed right against Long Chen\u2019s neck. As long as he opened his mouth, Long Chen\u2019s neck would immediately be bitten open.But whether it was while his wounds were being cleaned or when his rotten flesh was cut off, Little Snow merely trembled without making a single noise.An hour later, Long Chen had finished placing medicinal ointments all over Little Snow\u2019s body and wrapped up his wounds.Looking at Xiao Hua who seemed as if she had finally been relieved of a heavy burden, Long Chen smiled and placed Little Snow on his bed. Gently rubbing Little Snow\u2019s head, he explained, \u201cHe\u2019s my companion. You don\u2019t need to be so worried.\u201dLooking at the peacefully sleeping Little Snow, Xiao Hua shook her head. \u201cThat really almost frightened me to death. So humans can actually become companions with Magical Beasts.\u201dLong Chen smiled, \u201cSometimes, people are even more terrifying than Magical Beasts. Otherwise, your ancestors also wouldn\u2019t have brought you guys to such a place. At least there are warning signs when Magical Beasts are about to attack you. But when humans are planning on attacking you, there aren\u2019t any signs, and you won\u2019t be on guard. By the time you sense the danger, you\u2019ll already be dead. So your ancestors were actually very intelligent people. They understood that the danger you can see isn\u2019t the true danger. The truly dangerous things are those that you cannot see.\u201dXiao Hua was bewildered by what Long Chen was saying. She clearly didn\u2019t really comprehend what he was saying, but hearing him praise her ancestors still made her happy.\u201cHopefully, our kids will also be as smart and brave as you. Then, I\u2019ll become the person who has contributed the most to the village!\u201d Xiao Hua excitedly laughed.Long Chen\u2019s expression stiffened. Looking at her open and innocent expression, he bitterly smiled. He supposed this girl didn\u2019t know just how complicated having children was.Xiao Hua was a naive child. Although Long Chen was fond of her, he had no romantic feelings for her.He thought this matter over. In the end, he came up with a plan to leave the village in secret. Although that would be very hurtful to Xiao Hua, that was something that could not be avoided.But before he left, Long Chen still had to complete a couple of tasks. First, he had to repay his hunting debt to the forest divinity, and then he had to tell Xiao Hua what those gold coins were used for.There were at least several millions of gold coins. He had to warn her to be careful with their usage and not to let any greedy eyes fall on her.As long as she learned how to use those gold coins, then with the spatial ring, the amount they could procure from each trip would be enough to last the village for a whole year.Little Snow\u2019s arrival had caused all the villagers to become nervous. After all, in the past hundreds of years, that was the first time a Magical Beast had intruded on their village.The next day, when Little Snow awoke and became active, all the villagers once more became anxious. But Little Snow only obediently followed alongside Long Chen, not even looking at the others, appearing very cute.That caused the villagers to let their guards down slightly. There were even some curious children that stealthily approached Little Snow despite others berating them.At the beginning Little Snow just ignored them. When that group of small children was around three meters away from him, he suddenly glanced at them.Just that one glance terrified all those children. They all thought Little Snow was about to attack and fled for their lives, crying for someone to save their lives.One of those kids even tripped and fell to the ground. He just laid there crying, even wetting his pants.The adults watched as this happened. They saw that Long Chen merely smiled the whole time without doing anything. Due to their trust in Long Chen, they hadn\u2019t said anything up until this point.Seeing Little Snow actually send the group of children fleeing away with just a glance, they actually ended up laughing.This was the first time a Magical Beast had entered their village, so even the adults were extremely curious.\u201cLong Chen, what Magical Beast is this?\u201d None of the villagers were able to recognize Little Snow.\u201cA Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf. When matured, it is a third rank Magical Beast,\u201d replied Long Chen.\u201cThird\u2026 third rank?!\u201dThey had only ever heard of second rank Magical Beasts! And that was only from listening to their elders who told a story from over a hundred years ago. One of their ancestors had once come to a halt at a mountain stream while hunting and ended up running into a second rank Magical Beast. The encounter would end up becoming a disaster for the village.Back then, over thirty hunters had worked together in an attempt to hunt it, the result of which was that only a dozen of them had returned alive.From that point onwards, they no longer dared to cross that mountain stream. Moreover, the villagers who ended up committing grave crimes were forever forced over that mountain stream.In reality, the first thing that had popped into the villagers\u2019 minds when the forest god had requested a second rank Magical Beast was that disaster.At that time, everyone\u2019s expressions had been extremely unsightly. But Xiao Hua had been determined to save Long Chen. She said that after Long Chen was healed, they would definitely be able to work together and kill a second rank Magical Beast.And so just a second rank Magical Beast was already a nightmare in their eyes. But as for this little wolf in front of them, it was an even more frightening third rank Magical Beast.Everyone assembled for lunch and afterwards, Long Chen spoke to the village chief. \u201cChief, are there any second rank Magical Beasts around?\u201dHis expression changed slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m thinking of going to hunt second rank Magical Beasts to return the forest god\u2019s favor as early as possible. The feeling of owing others is truly uncomfortable.\u201dEveryone in the village shivered in trepidation, but Long Chen noticed that some of them were actually eager to give it a try.\u201cChild, I do know of the location of a second rank Magical Beast. However, it is extremely hard to handle.\u201d The elder was hesitant.\u201cDon\u2019t worry village chief. I\u2019m already fully recovered, and an ordinary second rank Magical Beast is not a problem,\u201d laughed Long Chen.Long Chen was actually being modest. Even before he had broken through to Blood Condensation, ordinary second rank Magical Beasts had already not been his match.And now that he had advanced, even though he was still only at that initial advancement and had yet to even reach the first Heavenstage, his blood was already being purified with each breath, and his blood and strength continued to grow stronger.Long Chen wanted to find a second rank Magical Beast and test his strength. He also wanted to see just how many styles of Parting Wind he could use.Since Long Chen was so determined, the elder sighed, \u201cFine. All our village\u2019s fighters will bring the best equipment to help you slaughter that brute.\u201dAll the hunters let out a cheer of agreement and they returned to their houses to get their weapons and everything else they needed.Long Chen looked at those fervent people and immediately realized there had been a misunderstanding.\u201cSenior village chief, you don\u2019t need to rouse everyone for this matter. Just tell me where it is. I alone am enough,\u201d said Long Chen lightly.\u201cWhat?!\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 KingKong Fury ApePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeWithin the undulating mountain range, huge trees with thick vines covering them reached for the sky, and the occasional roar of wild beasts would shake the land.A ten-meter-tall KingKong Fury Ape emitted an angry roar that shook the forest, causing streams of leaves to tumble to the ground.Facing the KingKong Fury Ape was a human who wasn\u2019t even comparable to it in size.That person was Long Chen who was currently emitting intense fluctuations that made him seem like a celestial emperor.This particular location was originally a forest, however, now all the huge trees within hundreds of meters had collapsed. The vegetation and rocks had been sent tumbling away, blowing open an empty land.Long Chen had received a map from the village chief which marked the dangerous areas. This particular spot was the location of a second rank Magical Beast.That would be KingKong Fury Ape in front of him. Back then, the ancestors of the villagers had accidentally charged into its territory, resulting in disastrous casualties.The villagers both hated and feared this KingKong Fury Ape. When they heard Long Chen was planning on hunting a second rank Magical Beast, it was the first thing they had thought of.However, Long Chen had refused to have any others come with him. Even Xiao Hua wasn\u2019t an exception. He had followed the map by himself, easily finding this place.As expected, the KingKong Fury Ape\u2019s awareness of its territory was extremely great. As soon as Long Chen had stepped into this region of the forest, he was found and attacked.\u201cROAR!!!\u201d The KingKong Fury Ape heavily beat its own chest with its huge fists. The next instant, it charged at Long Chen.The KingKong Fury Ape was a Magical Beast that specialized in power. But compared to the Burst Bear, it was much more terrifying since it had reached the second rank.Its enormous body was practically a small mountain. Its speed was also shocking, and it arrived in front of Long Chen in the blink of an eye.Long Chen formed a fist, and the instant he did, he actually disappeared, leaving behind a wild gale.He had already been fighting with the KingKong Fury Ape for a full hour. It truly was worthy of being a second rank Magical Beast; its power was extremely great.According to Long Chen\u2019s estimates, the Burst Bear he had killed before would probably not even be able to take a single blow from this KingKong Fury Ape.Just a random blow from it had tens of tons of force behind it. If Long Chen hadn\u2019t advanced to Blood Condensation, then just relying on his physical body, he also wouldn\u2019t have been able to beat it.Having fought on equal grounds for so long, now Long Chen was planning on not wasting any more time.\u201cBreaking Wind Fist!\u201d Wild gales unfurled and a faint layer of light appeared on Long Chen\u2019s fist.His fist heavily smashed onto the KingKong Fury Ape\u2019s arm. With a muffled bang, the mountain-like KingKong Fury Ape was actually sent flying dozens of meters away, slamming into and breaking over ten huge trees behind it.As expected, his physical body had greatly improved after advancing to Blood Condensation. Even his control of Battle Skills had improved.The power of the Breaking Wind Fist was much greater than when he had been in the Qi Condensation realm. Adding on to his physical strength, it was able to force back a second rank Magical Beast.Long Chen himself hadn\u2019t expected to grow so much stronger after entering the Blood Condensation realm.The KingKong Fury Ape was on its last legs. It emitted a loud roar and angrily glared at him.It had been the overlord of this region for hundreds of years. This was the first time it had been provoked by a small human, and it was completely unable to accept this.BOOM!It smashed the land, and suddenly its black fur stood completely on end. A frightening aura came from it.Long Chen was startled, immediately sensing the change. He hadn\u2019t expected that this Magical Beast actually had power hidden in reserve.It raised its fangs at Long Chen and stamped on the ground, immediately charging over like a meteorite.Long Chen suddenly felt an intense pressure. He didn\u2019t dare be careless. His power exploded out and he once more used the Breaking Wind Fist.But this time Long Chen felt his body shake and he was sent flying when his fist smashed into the KingKong Fury Ape. He only managed to stabilize himself after being blown sixty meters away.\u201cIt was actually able to attack on the same level as a Tendon Transformation expert. As expected, the body of a Magical Beast truly is frightening.\u201dLong Chen shook his slightly numb arm. That attack had been extraordinary just now. If he hadn\u2019t advanced to Blood Condensation, there would have even been a chance his arm would have broken.Although that attack hadn\u2019t been on the same level as Marquis Ying\u2019s attacks, it was only one level weaker. It really was true that humans on the same level as Magical Beasts were not able to fight against them.Obviously, this KingKong Fury Ape had its own hidden trump cards. Only this was its strongest state.It roared angrily once more and charged at Long Chen. But before Long Chen even made a move, a ray of light suddenly shot past and struck it head-on.That ray of light had been extremely fast, and it had struck the KingKong Fury Ape before it could even react.But that light didn\u2019t even manage to cut through its skin before being broken.Long Chen was slightly surprised. At some unknown time, Little Snow who had been hiding in the distance had come up and his mouth was currently open.\u201cA wind blade?\u201d Long Chen had heard before that third rank and higher Magical Beasts had their own inherited Battle Skills. So it was actually true.But the wind blade Little Snow had spat out had been pitifully weak. Of course, just how old was Little Snow? Little Snow hadn\u2019t even truly reached the first rank yet, but was still able to launch long-distance attacks, which was shocking.Seeing that his attack hadn\u2019t had any effect, Little Snow prepared to attack again. But suddenly he felt himself being sent flying.\u201cDon\u2019t make trouble.\u201d Long Chen had thrown Little Snow further away. That little fellow must have thought he had been in danger and wanted to help.But Little Snow\u2019s little bit of attack power couldn\u2019t even tickle the KingKong Fury Ape. He was afraid Little Snow would be hurt, so he directly threw him somewhere safer.Looking at the KingKong Fury Ape charging at him, Long Chen coldly shouted, \u201cDivine ring!\u201dSuddenly a ring of light appeared behind Long Chen. It grew to a diameter of three hundred meters. The original cyclones could no longer be seen. The thirteen cyclones had merged into one, and looking from a distance, it appeared to be a rainbow.After the divine ring appeared, heaven and earth trembled slightly. The spiritual qi within an area of hundreds of miles flowed towards Long Chen, causing him to immediately feel invigorated, his whole body full of strength.Long Chen had realized that after his thirteen cyclones had merged together, the effect was just like when he used to inject some of his FengFu Star\u2019s spiritual qi into his cyclones. However, now it was constant. Their efficiency had reached a terrifying level.At this point, the KingKong Fury Ape had already arrived in front of Long Chen. Without even thinking about it, Long Chen punched out.BANG! An explosion shook the sky as terrifying waves of qi radiated out. Long Chen\u2019s long hair danced and his clothes fluttered. The divine ring behind him contrasted and complimented him, making him appear like a celestial emperor disdainfully looking down on the nine heavens.The KingKong Fury Ape\u2019s terrifying attack was actually blocked by Long Chen completely. At this time, Long Chen felt an unprecedented strength within him.It appeared he had still underestimated this divine ring. The divine ring formed from the superimposition of thirteen cyclones caused his strength to explode by an enormous amount. It was so great that even he felt some disbelief.He didn\u2019t have much understanding of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. It truly was a technique that was endlessly profound and would require continuous exploration. This combination of the thirteen cyclones was even more effective than when he had used his FengFu Star\u2019s spiritual qi to empower his cyclones.Long Chen let out an earth-shaking roar. That enormous KingKong Fury Ape was shockingly, directly thrown into the air by him.His broadsword then arced through the air, releasing a sword-light that cut straight through its body, causing blood to fill the air.The two pieces of its corpse fell to the ground.\u201cIt really is worthy of being an Earth class Battle Skill. What a terrifying killing strength.\u201dEven such a powerful being like the KingKong Fury Ape was cleanly cut in two by the Parting Wind Slash. It seemed he had been looking down on the technique.In reality, Long Chen was still unaware that not all Earth class Battle Skills could launch ranged attack. On the contrary, most Battle Skills worked by being applied on top of weapons.It was only by chance that the Three Style Parting Wind was a Battle Skill that used the body\u2019s wind attribute energy to release Sword Qi that could be used for ranged attacks.Such Battle Skills were actually quite rare. It also required that the martial artist have wind attribute spiritual qi in order to train in it.It wasn\u2019t like ordinary Earth class Battle Skills that were attributeless that only required spiritual qi to be injected into the weapon.Although such techniques were rare, it also had its own flaws. The main one was that those without the wind attribute spiritual qi in their body were unable to use it.As for Long Chen, he was just a beginner to the cultivation world and didn\u2019t know what this \u2018attribute\u2019 meant. Just a careless test had allowed him to successfully train in it, but he had no idea about why he could use it.If such a situation was known by Xia Changfeng, wouldn\u2019t he be angered enough to die a second time?\u201cAowu!\u201dLong Chen was interrupted from his thoughts by Little Snow running up to the KingKong Fury Ape\u2019s corpse. He actually started to wildly tear at its flesh.The KingKong Fury Ape\u2019s physical body was extremely powerful and tough. Yet, Little Snow was still able to tear off a piece of its flesh for himself. But chewing it was extremely strenuous.Little Snow seemed to be similar to Wilde in that meat was the source of their strength and could allow them to get stronger. As soon as either of them saw meat, they had to eat it.Long Chen took out a knife and cut off a few pieces for Little Snow. But Little Snow ignored that, focusing completely on tearing the KingKong Fury ape\u2019s thigh muscles.Long Chen helplessly cut a few strips of that part off.This corpse was to be offered to the forest divinity, but Long Chen presumed that a gentle woman like her wouldn\u2019t be so stingy as to bicker about a bit of flesh.Little Snow had traveled hundreds of miles for him. Who knew just how much he had suffered? If he didn\u2019t let that little fellow eat his full, Long Chen would feel even more guilty.Once the little fellow had eaten his full and his stomach was bulging out, he finally stopped and Long Chen tidied up the corpse, preparing to drag it along.That was because its corpse was too big and was unable to fit in the spatial ring. The other reason was that Long Chen wanted to keep the scent of its blood outside. He continued deeper into the depths of the forest.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 World Binding Blood SacrificePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeA six-meter-long Bright Colored Tiger fell to the ground with a seven-foot-long broadsword stabbed into its head.The broadsword was yanked out of its head, bringing with it a spray of blood.Long Chen wiped off some sweat. Looking at the several Magical Beast corpses behind him, he relaxed a great deal.Over the past two days, Long Chen had dragged along Magical Beast corpses behind him, and as he had expected, the scent of their blood had drawn over other beasts.Those beasts had exceptionally keen senses when it came to the scent of that blood. That scent meant a Magical Beast was injured. Magical Beasts were extremely ferocious, and oftentimes there would be intense battles over territory.Deep within this thick forest, being injured signified that death was near. Those beasts that wouldn\u2019t dare provoke Magical Beasts in normal times would all leap at this chance.This tiger was already his eighth Magical Beast. Now there was a long string of Magical Beast corpses behind him.There were tigers, leopards, and even huge lizards. They were all neatly strung together firmly by beast tendons.Little Snow leisurely padded along those corpses and would take frantic bites until he was completely full, then fall asleep. After a nap, he would immediately start eating again.This long train of Magical Beasts had become a luxurious carriage with a free buffet for him.Long Chen checked over his spoils. He currently had three second rank Magical Beasts and six peak first rank Magical Beasts. That should be enough to repay the forest god of her favor.A single second rank Magical Beast\u2019s flesh definitely contained more energy than even ten first rank Magical Beasts. Long Chen\u2019s spoils had long since exceeded the forest god\u2019s demands.Long Chen remembered her benevolence and didn\u2019t want to owe too much. Furthermore, when he had been resisting the heavenly punishment, it was the forest god who had helped him.He had actually been hoping to get a bit more, but even after walking for a whole extra day, there were no more Magical Beasts that came. There didn\u2019t seem to be anymore second rank Magical Beasts in the vicinity.As for weaker first rank Magical Beasts, they were attracted by the blood, but they didn\u2019t approach. Even a wounded second rank Magical Beast could easily kill them.So despite roaming around for a whole day, he no longer made any more harvests. He switched directions to go directly to the mountain peak of the forest god.When Long Chen arrived at that huge tree, the white-robed woman reappeared. But when she saw the long train of huge Magical Beast corpses behind him, she didn\u2019t have too great of a reaction.\u201cYou\u2019ve come.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve come to settle my debt,\u201d smiled Long Chen.\u201cThe remuneration you brought has exceeded our initial pledge. That\u2019s not exactly fair to you.\u201d\u201cIn this world, there was never any real fairness. I\u2019m just doing this to make myself feel better. I don\u2019t like owing people,\u201d said Long Chen.She nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019ll thank you. The flesh you\u2019ve brought should be enough for me to fully activate the World Binding Blood Sacrifice and break out of this space back to the Spirit World.\u201dThat huge tree trembled slightly, and those huge corpses all disappeared in just a moment.\u201cAo!\u201d Little Snow who was originally sleeping on those corpses was suddenly awoken. He couldn\u2019t help but go into a wild panic when he saw all those corpses had disappeared. He wanted to get one last bite in, but he only bit down on empty air. He actually started roaring at the woman angrily.\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss Little Snow.\u201d Long Chen shouted laughingly at that little fellow to calm him down.\u201cHaha, you think I stole your meat?\u201d She laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s true you need meat to grow stronger. But I can give you something much better than meat.\u201dShe waved her hand and a bright ray of light poured into Little Snow\u2019s forehead. Shockingly, Little Snow began to slowly grow larger after being enveloped by that light.He actually grew from being just one meter long to being close to three meters long. Little Snow now almost reached Long Chen\u2019s shoulders.Furthermore, Long Chen could sense a powerful aura that was only becoming stronger coming from Little Snow.\u201cSecond rank?!\u201d The current aura coming from Little Snow was the aura of a second rank Magical Beast!\u201cI took your meat, so I\u2019ll give you the energy to mature so that we\u2019re even.\u201d The woman laughed and rubbed Little Snow\u2019s head.That really startled Long Chen. Other than himself, Little Snow had never allowed anyone else to touch him. If Little Snow were to attack, that would definitely sour the situation.But Little Snow was unusually calm. He seemed to actually enjoy her rubbing. Afterwards he lay on the ground and took a nap.\u201cI\u2019ve completely awakened its spirit. It can count as me compensating it,\u201d she said to Long Chen.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like I owe you another favor now?\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but shake his head, smiling bitterly.He had thought he could completely repay his favors this time. But in the end, he owed another favor right now. However, that favor was definitely worth it.Little Snow was a third rank Magical Beast, a Scarlet Flame Snow Wolf. His battle strength was extremely great. Now that he had already advanced to the second rank, even if he couldn\u2019t defeat a Tendon Transformation expert, he would still be able to fight against them for a while.Such a powerful companion could definitely provide a measure of safety for someone like him who was surrounded by danger.\u201cYou\u2019re too gracious. My spirit race also doesn\u2019t like owing favors. Originally, it probably would have taken me at least a couple of hundred years before being able to return to the Spirit World. But you\u2019ve allowed me to return home much earlier. The one who should be saying thanks is me,\u201d she politely said. \u201cNow I\u2019ll be beginning the World Binding Blood Sacrifice. You should back up a bit.\u201dHearing that, Long Chen hastily woke Little Snow up and rushed further away. With how solemn she was, he didn\u2019t dare to be careless. At the same time, he was also extremely curious as to what that so-called World Binding Blood Sacrifice was.Rumble\u2026Long Chen was several miles away when the rumbling began. He hastily turned to look back and jumped in shock.The huge tree which stretched several miles into the sky had suddenly begun to explosively grow. Its enormous treetop spread, piercing through the clouds and covering half the sky.The countless leaves completely hid the mountain peak with countless symbols shining on top of them. Divine light overflowed from them and covered the sky.Long Chen watched with his mouth wide open. What kind of existence was this? Was it really a god? Did this world really have divinities?If it wasn\u2019t a god, what else could cover up the entire sky, what else had an aura that was so ancient? In front of that intimidating aura, Long Chen felt as if he wasn\u2019t even an ant, as if he was just a speck of dust.\u201cIt\u2019s the forest god!\u201d The village chief was also shocked, but the villagers recognized it to be the forest god.Looking at the scene, all those villagers knelt on the ground and prostrated themselves towards that direction.The forest god appeared in the sky above. She formed a strange hand seal.\u201cRespected ancestors, please hear your people\u2019s call. With blood as the guide, open a path home for your people - World Binding Blood Sacrifice!\u201dFollowing her devout shout, an image made of blood appeared in the sky. By carefully looking at it, you could tell that that was the image of a leaf.Long Chen guessed that the blood was the essence blood of the Magical Beasts she had collected over the years. But he still didn\u2019t truly comprehend why someone as amazingly powerful as her would use human hunters to collect that blood.With her terrifying cultivation base, no matter how strong the Magical Beast was, they would all be blown to bits just by a single breath. Was that will of resentment she had mentioned actually so terrifying?BOOM! Heaven and earth trembled, causing Long Chen to almost fall to the ground. Raising his head, he saw that the blood image in the sky had begun to twist.Following space\u2019s slow warping, a huge gate fifty miles high formed. As soon as it fully formed, it began to slowly open.The instant that door opened, Long Chen saw the world within it. That was also a world of endless trees.But each huge tree was so tall as to prop up the heavens. There were also countless powerful beasts roaming within, each of them so large that they were comparable to mountains.A spiritual qi that was so dense it had almost turned solid also came out of that huge door.Just taking a slight breath, Long Chen felt his cultivation base quickly rising. It truly was too shocking.\u201cI\u2019m about to leave, so thank you for your help. Expert, my spirit race looks forward to your arrival. I know that that day will not be too far off.\u201dThe woman waved her hand to Long Chen, and the huge heaven-reaching tree slowly shrunk and entered the gate.\u201cThis is my gift to you. The previous agreement is over, so treat it as a new promise.\u201dShe extended a hand and a small drop of dark green blood fell towards Long Chen. Long Chen hastily reached out to receive it.That droplet emitted an extremely dense vitality. Long Chen could sense the terrifying life energy within it.That woman\u2019s entire figure dimmed greatly after sending that drop out. Obviously, that drop was an extremely important thing to her.\u201cI can sense that you will become a peak expert in the future. My spirit race needs your help. Your body actually has- AHHH!\u201dBefore she got halfway, she suddenly let out a terrified scream, and without even the time to say goodbye to Long Chen, she disappeared behind the huge door.BOOM!Seven-colored lightning abruptly appeared in the sky and smashed that huge door to pieces.That had happened too fast, and before Long Chen could even react, the huge door had already faded away. The world on the opposite side could no longer be seen. It was as though everything had been a dream.But that mountain the forest god had been on was now a crater.Now the forest god had left, but this place still had some remnant dense spiritual qi in the air. Long Chen quickly sat down and began to cultivate with Little Snow standing guard.It went without saying that Long Chen\u2019s decision was extremely smart. In just a short six hours, an explosive sound came from his body.That explosive sound came from Long Chen\u2019s blood. He had finally entered the first Heavenstage of Blood Condensation, becoming a true Blood Condensation expert.Since the leftover spiritual qi from that huge door had already dissipated at this point, Long Chen no longer wasted any more time. He directly returned to the village. It was time to say farewell.But there was still one big question that kept repeating in his mind at this time. What had the forest god meant at that last point? What had she been meaning to say before leaving in a panic?She said his body had something on it? What could possibly cause someone as strong as her to feel so afraid?As those questions churned in his head, he ended up getting quite close to the village when suddenly a faint scent of blood floated past his nose.Long Chen\u2019s expression changed and he pressed down on the ground, shooting forward like an arrow towards the village.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sharp arrows were pointed at the villagers, Xiao Hua amongst them. Their faces were pale with fright.There were already three people lying on the ground with arrows stuck in them, their blood dyeing the ground beneath them.\u201cSpeak, have you seen this person?\u201d One of the middle-aged soldiers in golden armor shouted coldly, showing off a piece of paper with a drawing of a handsome youth with sharp eyebrows and bright eyes. Who else could it be but Long Chen?\u201cWe\u2019ve already said, we\u2019ve never seen anyone called Long Chen and we don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Why did you have to recklessly kill our villagers?\u201d Xiao Hua\u2019s face was deathly pale as she retorted angrily.They had no idea where this group of men had come from. But they had immediately surrounded the village, and the three hunters which had just gone out were directly shot to death.This both shocked and infuriated them. But in front of hundreds of pointed arrows, they didn\u2019t dare make any reckless moves. Some of them were grinding their teeth, wishing to charge forward.\u201cHmph, looks like you won\u2019t cry until you see your coffins. Go slaughter those children first. Let me see if they\u2019ll tell the truth.\u201d That middle-aged man snorted and ordered some of his subordinates forward. They immediately pointed their arrows at the dozen children.\u201cBastards, do you dare?\u201d The village chief roared angrily and threw those children behind him.\u201cKill them.\u201d That middle-aged man\u2019s expression was icy cold, and he didn\u2019t even bat his eye at the elder. In his eyes, these villagers were just a bunch of weeds.\u201cFine, kill us! We\u2019re not afraid! Brother Long Chen will definitely come to kill you as revenge for us!\u201d One of the children suddenly struggled free from one of the adults\u2019 guard and angrily pointed at that man.\u201cLittle kid, what nonsense are you saying?!\u201d The village chief hastily shouted at the child to stop, but it was already too late.That middle-aged man\u2019s eyes brightened and he coldly sneered, \u201cAs expected, Long Chen really did come here. Kill them all. We\u2019ll keep searching; he can\u2019t have run far.\u201dReceiving that order, those troops all emotionlessly released their arrows, shooting out a rain of arrows at the villagers.\u201cFuck off!\u201dA harsh shout suddenly shook their eardrums and a figure rushed over like a wild gale, arriving in front of Xiao Hua and the others. With a shake of his sword, a terrifying Sword Qi ferociously fell.The majority of those arrows were all shaken away by Long Chen. But there were still around a dozen of them that managed to slip through and hit the villagers. Pained cries rang out intermingled with the weeping of the children.Looking at Long Chen who had suddenly descended from the sky, those elite guards were all stupefied. Even the middle-aged commander was greatly shocked.\u201cZhou Weiqing, you damn bastard, all of you can go to hell!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s killing intent overflowed. He recognized that middle-aged man as Zhou Weiqing, the Savage Marquis!That bastard actually wanted to kill unarmed villagers, including the children. He was truly a bastard amongst bastards, especially in the eyes of Long Chen who had been saved by these villagers.\u201cParting Wind Slice!\u201d Long Chen\u2019s broadsword cut across the air in front of him, and a Sword Qi invisible to the naked eye shot out like a crescent moon, immediately cutting through those stupefied troops.That ferocious Sword Qi surged over before those troops had even reacted, immediately cutting them into pieces. Blood filled the air.Hundreds of elite troops were killed with a single slash of Long Chen\u2019s sword. The current Long Chen truly was just like a death god. Unending killing intent overflowed from his body.Only the Savage Marquis managed to escape that calamity. As soon as he had seen an uninjured Long Chen appear, he knew the situation had turned sour.The reports had stated that Long Chen was already on his last breaths. Even if he had managed to survive, he should still be heavily injured to the point where he might die at any time.But the fourth prince had stated that if he was dead, then he wanted to see his corpse, and if he was alive, then he wanted him captured. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to set his heart at ease. He had sent warriors accustomed to pursuing and tracking as well as hunting dogs. After half a month\u2019s chase, they had finally found this village.They were certain Long Chen had either passed through here or was currently hiding within the village, recuperating from his wounds. So the Savage Marquis had wanted to directly kill these villagers who were hiding his existence.And he had truly guessed right. Long Chen had shown himself. But unfortunately, the result was not what he had presumed. When a perfectly healthy Long Chen had appeared, the Savage Marquis had been scared witless.Even back then during the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival, Long Chen had still managed to kill Huang Chang, his name shaking the empire. On the other hand, the Savage Marquis was only at the early stage of Blood Condensation. How could he possibly be a match for Long Chen?He had thought he would be able to capture a tiger on its deathbed, but he had miscalculated. The instant he had seen Long Chen strike, he had quickly retreated without even thinking about it. At the same time, he also took out a shield to protect himself.By the time Long Chen\u2019s Sword Qi had reached him, he had already fled to the edge of the attack. But even so, the shield in his hand was still broken and he spat out blood.However, the Savage Marquis truly was an expert. He was someone who had already seen blood before. Resisting the intense pain from his stomach, he used his full strength to flee deep into the forest.\u201cYou want to run?\u201dA sinister ruthlessness appeared on Long Chen\u2019s face. Kicking up an arrow from the ground, he flung it forward.The arrow shot through the air like lightning. The Savage Marquis, who was fleeing for his life, didn\u2019t realize that an arrow which could take his life was right behind him.The arrow pierced right through his armor. The great force behind it had been so great that the golden armor was unable to pose even the slightest bit of resistance.The Savage Marquis\u2019s body was shaken by that force, and he was sent tumbling through the air into a huge tree dozens of meters away.He violently spat out blood. That arrow had violently shaken his inner organs.\u201cDon\u2019t kill him, Little Snow!\u201d Long Chen suddenly noticed a white light dash towards Zhou Weiqing and hastily shouted out. He was leaving Zhou Weiqing alive because he still had some use for him.Little Snow stopped when he heard Long Chen\u2019s call. He had already arrived right at that huge tree and was motionlessly staring at the Savage Marquis.Seeing that the Savage Marquis was under control, Long Chen quickly ran over to the villagers, bending over to examine their arrow wounds. There were three people who had been struck through the vitals and had already died. Amongst them was even a seven-year-old child.This made Long Chen feel as though it was his own heart that was being pierced. This had been brought on by him. He was filled with hate; however, he didn\u2019t know whether that hatred was for Marquis Ying, the fourth prince, Zhou Weiqing, or himself.He quickly gave the injured people some medicinal pills. As long as they hadn\u2019t died immediately, Long Chen\u2019s medicinal pills would ensure that they would completely recover.The other villagers also rushed to help the wounded. They also gathered up their dead, and the entire village mourned.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, village chief.\u201d Seeing the old man\u2019s tears streaming down his face, Long Chen was filled with regret. This was his own mistake.\u201cChild, this isn\u2019t your fault. Don\u2019t feel guilty.\u201d The old man shook his head.But the more he was like this, the worse Long Chen felt. If it hadn\u2019t been for him, such a calamity would definitely not have befallen the village.\u201cLong Chen, your heart is something we all understand. We\u2019re all a family, so don\u2019t be like this.\u201d Xiao Hua\u2019s comforting voice came from the side.Long Chen took a deep breath and said to her, \u201cXiao Hua, I\u2019m about to leave.\u201dHer body shook and she was overwhelmed with shock. \u201cYou\u2026 you want to leave us?\u201dLooking at her desolate expression and her uncontrollable tears, Long Chen could only quietly reply, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I must leave. You\u2019ve also seen that I have enemies. If I don\u2019t leave, a huge disaster will befall the village.\u201d Brushing back her hair lightly, he gently continued, \u201cThe village has already paid too high a price for me. I don\u2019t dare to stay with you. I hope\u2026 I hope you can forgive me.\u201dXiao Hua hit away Long Chen\u2019s hand and miserably cursed, \u201cYou bastard, you liar, I hate you!\u201dAfter saying that, she ran off to her own room and slammed the door shut.Long Chen sighed. Looking at that tightly closed door, he didn\u2019t say anymore. Thinking back to when he had just awoken, he recalled Xiao Hua\u2019s sweet and satisfied smile when she said he was her man.\u201cChild, don\u2019t feel too bad. If you want to leave, then leave. Remember, if you don\u2019t like the outside world, you can always return. This place is also your home,\u201d said the old man sincerely as he patted Long Chen\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThank you, village chief.\u201d The village chief\u2019s approval did make him feel a bit better.\u201cAs for Xiao Hua, I\u2019ll console her. Don\u2019t worry, she is a sensible child. She\u2019ll slowly come to understand this.\u201dLong Chen nodded. He took out a few medicinal pills from his spatial ring. These medicinal pills were varied in quality, but even the worst ones would still be miraculous medicines in the eyes of these hunters.Now that the forest god had left, the village no longer had her support. They would only be able to rely on themselves in the future. Long Chen left behind large quantities of healing medicines as well as a recipe for a medicinal liquid that they could make on their own.The village already had a couple of such recipes, but they were incomparable to Long Chen\u2019s. Other than medicinal pills, Long Chen also wrote several experiences and insights that pertained to the Qi Condensation realm\u2019s cultivation. He also left behind the Breaking Wind Fist, Windchasing Steps, and other techniques of that level for them.That was in the hopes that the village would be able to nurture some experts. If the village had a couple of Blood Condensation experts, they would definitely be much safer.He also left behind a dozen Blood Breaking Pills. As long as someone advanced to the ninth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation, they would immediately advance to Blood Condensation after taking one of them.Using a medicinal pill to break through was likely to cause your foundation to be flawed. But even so, to these people, that was not something to complain about. Without Long Chen\u2019s assistance, most of them would be unable to step into Blood Condensation in their whole life.Only by doing all of these could he feel at ease. Long Chen trusted that from today onwards, the village would only continue growing stronger.Now they had medicinal pills, Battle Skills, and weapons. In the future, even if they didn\u2019t have the forest god, they would still be able to survive very well.When they arrived at the village gate to send him off, the entire village gathered over to reluctantly say goodbye to Long Chen. There were even some children who tightly hugged his leg, not letting him leave.This scene truly did cause Long Chen to feel sad inside, but he had to leave. The only thing he regretted was that Xiao Hua continued to stay locked in her room. It seemed she really did hate him now.After saying goodbye, Long Chen was just about to leave.\u201cWait!\u201dLong Chen paused and slowly turned back. Xiao Hua opened her door and ran right up next to him.Her originally bright eyes were now red and filled with pain.\u201cLong Chen, I know I can\u2019t keep you. I made this just now. I hope you can forever wear it on your body.\u201dAfter saying that, Xiao Hua took out a necklace that was made from some multi-colored rocks.\u201cHaha, perhaps this gift is too poor and will be laughed at.\u201d Xiao Hua laughed mockingly at herself. But although she smiled, tears kept falling from her eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll properly keep it in my care. But how about you come with me?\u201d Long Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart ache when he looked at Xiao Hua.Her eyes brightened for a moment, but they quickly dulled again. She shook her head, \u201cWe are people who live in different worlds. I can\u2019t leave my family. I just hope that when you look upon this necklace in the future, you\u2019ll remember that there was once a girl\u2026 whose heart\u2026 yearned to go hunting with you\u2026 and make babies.\u201dTowards the end, Xiao Hua\u2019s voice ended up becoming choked with emotion. After forcing out those last words, she fell into Long Chen\u2019s embrace and began to weep and bawl.Long Chen didn\u2019t know how he managed to leave in the end. He felt his own heart shattering. This was the first time he experienced being so helpless. This was a helplessness that a higher cultivation base could not resolve.Dragging the half-dead Savage Marquis, Long Chen disappeared into the depths of the forest.Xiao Hua\u2019s tears continued to flow as she watched that figure disappear from her view. A light breeze blew by, bringing with it the tumbling of dried leaves. The autumn wind was cold.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 Extreme UrgencyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeOnce Long Chen had dragged the Savage Marquis dozens of miles away, he threw him to the ground. Zhou Weiqing was already so heavily wounded that just this little impact caused him to spit out more blood.Having been hit by the arrow which Long Chen had thrown so powerfully, his organs had already been shaken into pieces. But as a Blood Condensation expert, the blood in his body contained a great deal of life energy, so he wouldn\u2019t die immediately.\u201cZhou Weiqing, tell me, how should I kill you?\u201dLong Chen looked down at this man who was once a powerful expert in his eyes, his voice filled with bone-chilling coldness.If it had just been a personal enmity between the two of them, Long Chen wouldn\u2019t have minded giving him a quick death. But thinking back to the corpses of those villagers and their sorrowful expressions, his hatred of this bastard exploded.He didn\u2019t know just what manner he could kill Zhou Weiqing that would relieve his anger. He only coldly contemplated this, thinking of a suitable method.\u201cLong\u2026 Long Chen, don\u2019t kill me! I\u2019ll tell you all my secrets! I was also forced, so I was also helpless!\u201dZhou Weiqing was as pale as a sheet of paper. He could feel his life force quickly fading. Right now, the only one that could save him was Long Chen who was a pill cultivator.In order to save his own life, this proud and arrogant noble no longer cared about anything and even begged Long Chen for mercy.\u201cDoes saying that have any meaning at this time? I already know that everything was planned by the fourth prince. As long as I return to the capital, everything will be revealed. There is no need for you to talk,\u201d snorted Long Chen coldly.\u201cNo, no, Long Chen, the situation is definitely not as simple as you think! As long as you promise to let me go, I\u2019ll tell you something extremely urgent. It definitely won\u2019t disappoint you!\u201d said Zhou Weiqing hastily.Long Chen coldly said, \u201cSpeak. If it really is helpful to me, I won\u2019t mind leaving you alive.\u201dZhou Weiqing celebrated and hastily said, \u201cYour household has already been captured and placed into prison. They\u2019re currently waiting to be executed.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dLong Chen\u2019s expression changed and he harshly shouted, \u201cBastard, you dare try to trick me?\u201d\u201cNo! I definitely don\u2019t dare trick you!\u201d\u201cOnce Wilde returned to the capital, he should have immediately gone to protect my family. How could they possibly be captured? Furthermore, even if Wilde didn\u2019t inform him, how could grandmaster Yun Qi just watch without lifting a finger?\u201d Long Chen raged.\u201cWilde truly did rush to your family as soon as possible, but he wasn\u2019t able to protect your household.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Even with Long Chen\u2019s calm, he was still panicking now.\u201cCough, cough\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing wanted to speak but an intense bout of coughing overcame him.Long Chen coldly snorted. Zhou Weiqing was getting smart and resorting to petty tricks. He threw down a medicinal pill. \u201cTake it, it\u2019ll heal your wounds.\u201d\u201cThank you, young master.\u201dZhou Weiqing hastily swallowed. He had always kept an eye on Long Chen for years, and he knew that he was just like his father and would take his promises seriously.But so far he had only agreed to let him go and hadn\u2019t promised to heal his wounds. If Long Chen left, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to support himself for more than a couple of hours before the spiritual qi in his blood was exhausted.And within those few hours, he would be completely unable to walk out of this forest to find help, so he would definitely die. For him to be able to force Long Chen into giving him a medicinal pill in his state, there was no choice but to admit that Zhou Weiqing truly did have a cunning side.\u201cIf I tell you everything, you have to keep your promise and not make things hard for me.\u201d After taking that medicinal pill, Zhou Weiqing was surprised to see that his damaged organs were slowly healing back, meaning Long Chen\u2019s medicinal pill truly was very effective.But he once more repeated himself in order to be cautious. If Long Chen were to back out from his promise, it would be impossible for him to survive.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will use the Long family\u2019s reputation to guarantee it,\u201d snorted Long Chen coldly.Hearing that, Zhou Weiqing was relieved. With Long Chen\u2019s pride, the chance of him reneging on his promise was low.\u201cOnce Wilde returned to your home, he immediately alerted your mother. But they were unable to leave the Long household.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cBecause they had all been poisoned,\u201d answered Zhou Weiqing.Long Chen\u2019s expression became incredibly unsightly. \u201cWho did that?!\u201d\u201cYou mother\u2019s family did it. They\u2019re actually spies of the fourth prince. They had always been secretly controlling the Long household. When Wilde returned, he was too weak and also too hungry to fight back. As soon as he warned the Long household, they were all poisoned with an extremely undetectable poison. Normally it will conceal itself in the body. With your experience, you should also have heard of the Soul-Scattering Powder?\u201d probed Zhou Weiqing carefully.Long Chen\u2019s expression became even gloomier. The fact that Zhou Weiqing had said the Soul-Scattering Powder meant that he was telling the truth.Soul-Scattering Powder was an extremely rarely seen medicinal ingredient. Its poisonous nature wasn\u2019t actually strong, but it could confuse a person\u2019s spirit, causing them to enter a suspended animation state of fake death. Other than some people with strong Spiritual Strength, there were few that could block it.And this kind of medicinal ingredient was colorless and odorless. Ordinary people were unable to recognize it. As soon as they smelt the Soul-Scattering Powder, they would immediately sink into a deep sleep.Long Chen had never thought that the fourth prince\u2019s schemes would be so profound. His hatred of his mother\u2019s family also grew as he recalled their hypocritical faces. At this time, they had landed a fatal blow against his family.Thinking of his mother, who had been captured, a burning urgency filled him. He needed to rush back to the capital immediately to save his mother.\u201cWhat happened with grandmaster Yun Qi?\u201d Long Chen suddenly felt that something was strange. Was grandmaster Yun Qi being obstructed?\u201cAt that time, grandmaster Yun Qi was in seclusion to refine pills. Furthermore, this matter was done extremely covertly. Grandmaster Yun Qi didn\u2019t know of it, and once he knew, your family had already been imprisoned. At that time, he personally went to the imperial palace to demand that they release them, but the Empress Dowager showed him the photographic jade evidence of you killing the Grand Xia\u2019s prince, and thus, grandmaster Yun Qi was also helpless,\u201d explained Zhou Weiqing.He had truly been too careless. Long Chen regretted his own stupidity. Obviously, that photographic jade had been brought back by Marquis Ying.Him killing Xia Changfeng had entirely been part of the fourth prince\u2019s plans. Despite grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s illustrious status, his position was not one that could directly participate in the matters of the empire. And so he could only watch powerlessly.\u201cChu Xia!\u201d Long Chen ground his teeth angrily. It was as though he could see the fourth prince\u2019s mocking face, and killing intent overflowed from him.\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d Long Chen took a deep breath and suppressed his anger.\u201cWell, furthermore, they plan on executing them,\u201d said Zhou Weiqing carefully. Seeing Long Chen\u2019s frighteningly sinister expression, he was afraid he might forget himself in his anger and kill him.\u201cSince they haven\u2019t captured me, they\u2019re using my household to make up for it?\u201d Long Chen tightly clenched his fists. The flames of fury within his eyes almost took physical shape.\u201cThat\u2019s most likely correct.\u201d\u201cHmph, then their goal is to draw out my father, correct?\u201d Long Chen snorted. Although he was incredibly angry, Long Chen was still able to figure out the fourth prince\u2019s intentions.To the fourth prince, Long Chen was just a single chess piece. All the circumstances he had forced him into were just to draw out Long Tianxiao.He naturally also knew that the capital was filled with crouching dragons and hidden tigers waiting for Long Tianxiao to take the bait.Being treated as a chess piece by others was definitely a dislikable feeling. But for Chu Yao, Long Chen had been willing to play his part as a chess piece.He hadn\u2019t expected the fourth prince to be so ruthless. Not only had his plans involved Long Chen, but he had also implicated Long Chen\u2019s entire household. That was something which no one would be able to endure.\u201cChu Xia, wait for me! If I don\u2019t chop off your head this time, then I wouldn\u2019t be Long Chen!\u201dLong Chen suddenly thought of something and he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the date of the execution?\u201dZhou Weiqing was startled and replied, \u201cCounting the days, it should the day after tomorrow.\u201dHearing that, Long Chen no longer bothered with Zhou Weiqing. He called over Little Snow and started to wildly rush over to the capital.\u201cAo!\u201d Little Snow suddenly howled as they rushed.Long Chen was slightly startled. \u201cYou want me to ride you?\u201dLittle Snow let out a quiet roar. Not caring whether or not Long Chen wanted to, he flipped Long Chen up with his head, and Long Chen immediately felt his body become light as he was lifted up onto Little Snow\u2019s back.Now that the forest god had awakened Little Snow\u2019s spirit, he was now even larger than a horse. His body was over three meters long. He was no longer that adorable little fellow anymore.\u201cRoar!\u201dLong Chen smiled slightly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, once I\u2019m steadied, I won\u2019t fall\u2026 aiya!\u201dLittle Snow had already charged forward before he had finished speaking. Being caught by surprise, Long Chen was almost thrown off. He hurriedly grabbed onto Little Snow\u2019s fur.Only now did Long Chen experience just how terrifying the speed of a second rank Magical Beast was. The trees to either side blew by. The wild wind that whistled around made it difficult for him to even keep his eyes open.\u201cGood job Little Snow!\u201d Long Chen praised Little Snow. Originally, he had been worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to rush back to the capital in time. But with Little Snow\u2019s current speed, that didn\u2019t seem to be that much of a problem anymore.His worries also dissipated slightly. Looking at the quickly retreating trees, Long Chen\u2019s eyes flashed with a harsh intent. I\u2019m coming.\u2026Zhou Weiqing watched as Long Chen left. He was relieved that he had managed to keep his life. At the same time though, he was also filled with hatred.When he was young, he had been struck by Long Tianxiao\u2019s palm and his Dantian had been shaken, causing his cultivation base to forever stop at the early stage of Blood Condensation.Over ten years had passed, and now he had been suppressed under his son. Furthermore, he had been suppressed even more miserably. If he hadn\u2019t begged for mercy, even his life would have been lost.Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but grind his teeth. But then a sinister smile appeared on his mouth. Long Chen should just give up any thoughts of surviving now that he had gone to the capital.But before he followed Long Chen back to the capital, he still had one thing he had to do. That was to completely slaughter those villagers. Long Chen had definitely left behind some medicinal pills for them.\u201cAH!\u201d Zhou Weiqing screamed suddenly. An intense pain came from his arm. He looked over and saw that without realizing it, a red-colored ant had crawled up his arm and was now biting down on him.\u201cHeart Devouring Ant?!\u201dZhou Weiqing was terrified. As soon as he recognized that small ant, it was as though he had seen a demon. That was a terrifying poisonous ant.It was said that this kind of ant wasn\u2019t that strong. It only had a slight poisonous nature that wasn\u2019t life-threatening. But when they bit you, it would be incomparably painful, as if your heart and insides were being devoured.Zhou Weiqing swatted that ant, killing it in a single blow. Just as he was about to move, his eyes were suddenly filled with terror. He didn\u2019t know at what time, but now all the surrounding trees were covered with Heart Devouring Ants.He suddenly thought of the medicinal pill Long Chen had thrown to him. He remembered seeing a twinkle of ridicule in his eyes when he had given that to him.\u201cAHHHH!!!\u201dJust at this moment, thousands upon thousands of Heart Devouring Ants smelled a special smell coming from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body and charged over. They went all-out to devour as much of him as they could. In their eyes, his body was a huge delicacy.His miserable screams continued endlessly. The Heart Devouring Ants\u2019 poison wasn\u2019t strong and wouldn\u2019t kill him. But the intense pain would wrack his body so much that he would be unable to move.In this world, the most painful way to die was to clearly sense endless pain and want to faint, only to have losing consciousness become a luxury that wasn\u2019t given to you, and to have that pain continue until you were nothing more than a pile of bones.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 Execution GroundPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeThe Phoenix Cry imperial capital stood there as majestic as ever, emitting an ancient air. That was something that could not be concealed despite the several wars it had experienced in the past thousand years.But today, the imperial capital was no longer as bustling and filled with traffic as it normally was. It was filled with a foreboding air, and not a single shop opened its doors.In just a single month\u2019s time, the capital had completely changed. First the news of Xia Changfeng being murdered shook the entire Phoenix Cry Empire.But even more shocking was that the person who had killed the Grand Xia\u2019s prince was the most famous person in the capital, the junior generation\u2019s strongest member who had risen like a shooting star, Long Chen!When the photographic jade\u2019s images had spread throughout the capital, everyone had been completely shocked. The image of Long Chen killing Xia Changfeng was forever stuck in their minds.Long Chen, who was originally high-spirited and full of endless prospects, had now become the entire empire\u2019s number one wanted criminal.The Long household\u2019s people had all been imprisoned in just one night. After another few days, large quantities of soldiers began to flow towards the capital.Before anyone could even understand what was happening, four hundred thousand elite troops from the Grand Xia had encircled the city.Everyone had been incomparably nervous, waiting for the spark of a huge war to ignite the capital in flames. That thought caused all these people, who were used to living in peace and security, to be filled with fright.But the lucky thing was that the battle never occurred. The fourth prince had appeared to mediate both parties. Saying that he had already captured the killer and had investigated the whole matter, he gave the Grand Xia an acceptable account.Only then did the elite troops withdraw their siege of the capital. But they didn\u2019t go far. They pitched camps forty miles away from the capital. If the Phoenix Cry Empire didn\u2019t hand over acceptable terms, they definitely wouldn\u2019t mind starting a huge war.That foreboding air enveloped the entire capital. Although the capital had Marquis Ying and Marquis Wu leading the majority of the strongest troops in the empire, this situation had arisen so suddenly that they had been unable to collect the rest of their forces. If a battle really did start, whether they could win or not, the capital itself would definitely become the scene of disaster.At the same time, there were also people who secretly wondered what was going on. Weren\u2019t the Phoenix Cry Empire and the Grand Xia Empire supposed to be allies? How did they suddenly end up on opposite sides of the battlefield now?What kind of satirical situation was this? It was always the enemies you never thought about who did the most damage. Otherwise, there was no way they would have been able to encircle their capital so easily.Following the Long household\u2019s capture, huge waves erupted in the empire. The first thing people thought of was the Border Suppression Marquis, who was defending the border against the barbarian tribes.The Border Suppression Marquis had guarded the border for over ten years. He had control of fifty thousand elite troops that had fought with the barbarian tribes over and over. It could be said that his army was a true elite force.As for the \u2018elite troops\u2019 currently residing in the capital who lived peaceful, satisfied lives the entire time and had only completed some drilling, the difference was immense, completely incomparable.The Border Suppression Marquis\u2019s elite troops would definitely be able to fight enemies ten times their number. After the Empress Dowager had imperially arrested the Long household, everyone wondered just how Long Tianxiao would react.Ten days ago, sudden news had leaked that Long Chen\u2019s murder of Xia Changfeng had been incited by the crown prince, and so even the crown prince had been arrested.There had also been several \u2018henchmen\u2019 that had been taken in with him. Today was the day for all these \u2018murderers\u2019 to face their execution.Outside the city walls, the martial stage, that had often been used for fights, had been torn down to be replaced with a huge execution stage.On one side of the execution stage was the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s elite troops, while to the other side was the Grand Xia\u2019s elite troops. They both watched each other from a distance with the atmosphere being incredibly tense.The commoners of the Phoenix Cry Empire were also watching from far away. This was the most controversial and shocking matter that had occurred in the Phoenix Cry Empire in the last dozens of years.Not only was a noble family about to be eradicated, but the crown prince was also to be executed. There were also tens of members of the imperial court who had been implicated.There were two lines of people on the execution grounds, one lined up in the back and one lined up in the front. There were dozens of people in the front row, all wearing imperial robes. They were completely bound, lying there on the ground.Although everyone had already been prepared to see that, they were still greatly shaken. Those were the most senior ministers of the empire. Normally, just getting a glance of them was almost impossible, but today they had become prisoners.However, the most shocking thing for everyone was the sight of the person who was bound front at the execution platform. It was crown prince Chu Yang! The current Chu Yang had long since lost his majestic and graceful poise. His hair was a mess and his eyes darted around. He was mumbling something that couldn\u2019t be heard as he incessantly fiddled.Behind this group of people was another group of over twenty people. This group included maids and servants. They were actually the Long household\u2019s people.Mrs. Long was shackled by iron fetters. Her expression was haggard as she looked into the distance. Who knew what she was thinking.Other than Mrs. Long, the rest of the Long household\u2019s members couldn\u2019t help but weep. They knew that today would be the last day of their lives. Looking at the executioners beside them, they were filled with despair.\u201cAh, my Long family has truly let you down. If there is a next life, my Long family will definitely make it up to you.\u201dLooking at the weeping people surrounding her, Mrs. Long couldn\u2019t help but sigh. They were all innocent, but they had been implicated by being part of the Long household.\u201cMadam, don\u2019t say that. We are members of the Long household, and we will be part of the Long household even in death. We don\u2019t regret anything,\u201d said Bao-er firmly.\u201cHmph, you want a next life? Just keep on dreaming. Your Long household really is just a group of idiots,\u201d said a man with a long blade in his hand coldly.Mrs. Long glared hatefully at that man, her eyes filled with poison. She wished she could tear that man apart.\u201cLi Feng, you bastard, even as a ghost I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d Mrs. Long ground her teeth.That person was one of the officers in charge of the execution and was her older sister\u2019s son. Looking at him caused Mrs. Long to feel needle-like pain in her heart.Back when her family had been ignoring her, she had been completely dejected. But then recently, when they had warmed back up to her, her mood had completely reversed. She knew they were just currying favor, but they were her family after all. She still forgave them.But who would have thought that it would be her closest family that would force her Long household into the depths of despair? That had truly caused her to feel endless resentment.She remembered back when Wilde had returned to the Long household. Seeing her, the first thing he had said was, \u201cQuickly go ask for grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s help.\u201d He had then fainted straight away.When Marquis Ying had gone to chase after Long Chen into the forest, Wilde had already been completely exhausted. After just resting for a moment, he had suddenly remembered what Long Chen had told him and rushed back to the capital.Who knew whether it was Wilde\u2019s luck that was great or whether Marquis Ying\u2019s subordinates were incompetent, but Wilde managed to return without any resistance.However, he hadn\u2019t dared to stop to eat. He had relied only on his willpower to sustain himself until he had reached the Long household. After saying a single line, he had been overcome by his exhaustion and fainted.Wilde hadn\u2019t noticed that at that time, Mrs. Long was in the midst of chatting with her older sister\u2019s family. Perhaps even if he had noticed, he wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently.When Wilde had fainted, Mrs. Long had hastily shouted for people to help. Her older sister had immediately comforted her and called over two people who weren\u2019t that far away.Wilde had fainted due to hunger. In order to awaken, they had brought over several bowls of water, but Wilde still hadn\u2019t shown any signs of awakening.Just when Mrs. Long had felt that something wasn\u2019t right, she suddenly smelled a certain thing and immediately lost consciousness. But right before her eyes had completely closed, she had seen her older sister\u2019s smile that was full of ridicule.By the time she awakened once more, the entire Long household had been thrown into a dark prison. That caused Mrs. Long to be filled with regret and hatred as well as a deep sense of self-blame.Li Feng smiled coldly when he looked at her. \u201cEven as a ghost, you\u2019ll hate me? Hmph, even as ghosts you\u2019d just be a group of idiot ghosts not worth interacting with. Ten years ago you were all also this stupid. At that time, we had already decided to split worlds with you in order to avoid being implicated. And now it seems you\u2019ve become even dumber. After just saying a few random words, you actually ended up completely trusting us. If such an idiot didn\u2019t die, then it really would be a defiance of the heavens.\u201dMrs. Long trembled in anger. Tears flowed down her face, but she didn\u2019t say anything. This was her family?!\u201cYou don\u2019t need to cry. As my relative, I\u2019ll help to end your sorrow by speeding things up a bit. You won\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d Li Feng gently shook his blade and continued, \u201cBut aunt, I really do need to thank you. Once I chop off your head, my career will quickly advance. Now that so many people are about to die in high positions, there are many openings for some lucrative posts. One of those spots will definitely be mine. Once I\u2019m rich I definitely won\u2019t forget aunt\u2019s favor. During the New Year, I will definitely burn some paper money for you, haha.\u201d[1]\u201cLi Feng, you definitely won\u2019t die a good death!\u201d Bao-er cursed him to the side when she saw his satisfied smile. She really couldn\u2019t stand seeing this despicable bastard. Thinking back to when he had acted so well-behaved in front of them, his current expression made her nauseous.\u201cNot a good death? Hehe, that\u2019ll be you guys! Soon your heads will fall to the ground!\u201d Li Feng sinisterly laughed at Bao-er.Bao-er was just about to retort when a heavy figure was thrown to the ground beside her.\u201cWilde!\u201d Mrs. Long let out a sorrowful cry.Wilde currently looked like a hedgehog with long iron needles stabbing all over his body.Those were torture tools called Bone Eroding Needles. There was a painful poison coated on them that could erode a person\u2019s bones, causing the person to feel intense pain deep in their marrow.That kind of pain was something no one could resist. Most people were unable to even bear having one of the needles being pierced into them. Even cultivators would be unable to endure more than five of them. That kind of pain was enough to kill someone.But Wilde\u2019s body was completely covered with that kind of needle. Wilde\u2019s ability to resist pain was absolutely shocking. Originally, Wilde had been unconscious, but when he had been thrown on the ground, those needles had once more pricked his bones, causing him to awaken.\u201cMom, you don\u2019t need to be worried. Wilde doesn\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d Seeing Mrs. Long crying, Wilde tried to comfort her, even forcing out a slight smile.But the current Wilde had lost so much weight that he was now practically skin and bones. His smile was actually extremely ugly now.Back when Long Chen had brought Wilde back home for the first time, Long Chen had told Mrs. Long about his circumstances. He had hoped that his mother would accept him as her adopted son.Wilde had called Mrs. Long \u2018mom\u2019 the whole time, but Mrs. Long had always felt that the appellation was a bit strange and hadn\u2019t replied to it.But now when Wilde called her that, she couldn't help but feel sour inside. \u201cWilde, mom has let you down.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 CrisisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBe\u201cWilde, mom has let you down.\u201dMrs. Long was truly agonized. Wilde was a good child, and even at such a time, he still didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of resentment against her. He was actually consoling her instead. That made her feel even more forlorn.If it weren\u2019t for her family\u2019s schemes, she wouldn\u2019t have implicated everyone. Looking at Wilde who was on his last breaths but still acted as though he were fine, she felt as if a knife was stabbing into her heart.\u201cMom, don\u2019t be afraid. Long Chen will definitely come and save us,\u201d comforted Wilde. He did his best to sit up. That way he could alleviate some of the pressure from the needles and he could feel a bit more \u2018comfortable\u2019.\u201cChild, it\u2019s been hard on you.\u201d Each Bone Eroding Needle was a horrifying torturing object, and seeing them cover his body so densely caused her to cry even harder. Just how much pain had this child suffered?\u201cMom, I\u2019m fine. That bastard Marquis Ying interrogated me, but I didn\u2019t even know what he was talking about. In any case, I didn\u2019t say a word, infuriating the old bastard,\u201d laughed Wilde.Once Marquis Ying had recovered from his wounds, he had heard that Wilde had been captured. He had immediately gone to interrogate him alone.He was extremely curious about Wilde\u2019s physical body. He was still in disbelief that a novice like him, who hadn\u2019t even reached Blood Condensation, had been able to block his sword.He wanted to know how Wilde cultivated. However, he didn\u2019t have Long Chen\u2019s powerful soul. He was unable to see through the situation with Wilde\u2019s cells.Although he did find that Wilde\u2019s body was extremely strange with only four meridians, he had assumed that it was the result of training in some sort of mysterious cultivation technique since childhood.Marquis Ying naturally wouldn\u2019t give up a chance to obtain such a mysterious cultivation technique. Even if he couldn\u2019t cultivate it, it would definitely be a priceless treasure if he could obtain it.But he hadn\u2019t expected for a kid like Wilde to be so tough. He didn\u2019t say a single word, and no matter how he hit him, he didn\u2019t make a single sound.He had tried all sorts of torture, in the end even using the cruelest Bone Eroding Needles all over his body. But he still didn\u2019t say a single word.Later, Marquis Ying gradually realized that Wilde\u2019s body\u2019s strangeness was most likely due to his constitution.Perhaps Wilde\u2019s cultivation technique was something that others would be incapable of cultivating even if they had the technique! Forcefully cultivating in it would only result in death.The real question was just what kind of existence could block the pain of the Bone Eroding Needle? Even if you could resist one needle, who could possibly take ten of them without dying? Even a Tendon Transformation expert would go crazy from the pain of ten Bone Eroding Needles.Having understood that point, Marquis Ying no longer bothered with Wilde\u2019s cultivation technique. He was more interested in Wilde\u2019s physical body. He wanted to see just how many Bone Eroding Needles a person\u2019s body could take.And that was how Wilde had turned into a human-shaped hedgehog. That was absolutely shocking to Marquis Ying. Even being covered by the Bone Eroding Needles, he still didn\u2019t die. His physical body was too terrifying.It was at that time that he had been ordered to send Wilde to the execution ground, and only then did he stop his torture of Wilde.\u201cHmph, I guess you are pretty difficult to deal with since you could survive that many Bone Eroding Needles. I wonder if your neck will be able to stop my blade? I truly am curious,\u201d Li Feng said to Wilde coldly.\u201cYou bastard, just wait! Brother Long will definitely come to save us!\u201d Wilde retorted angrily.\u201cJust keep dreaming. No matter who comes, no one will be able to save you, not even God himself. Just quietly become a ghost,\u201d sneered Li Feng coldly. He no longer bothered with them.A disturbance arose as a party from both the Phoenix Cry Empire and the Grand Xia Empire walked out. On the side of the Phoenix Cry Empire was the Empress Dowager along with the princes, princesses, as well as the powerful chancellors.On the side of the Grand Xia Empire was a large, tower-like man wearing yellow robes. Behind him were three armed soldiers closely following him.Those four all emitted a terrifying pressure. Their reserved auras seemed like volcanoes that might erupt at any moment.The person at the front was the Grand Xia\u2019s Emperor, Xia Youyu. The three people behind him were the Grand Xia\u2019s peak experts. This time Xia Youyu had truly brought his entire empire\u2019s top forces here.The two groups stopped when they were a few dozen steps from each other. The fourth prince was the first to walk out. Behind him were two people, one of which was Marquis Ying. The other one was a slightly short, bearded man with a warhammer on his back. That was the equally famous Wu Yi who was known as Marquis Wu.Ever since the eldest prince had been removed from his position, the Empress Dowager had supported the fourth prince to become the inheritor of the empire, making him become the new crown prince. And once the fourth prince had become the crown prince, in a thunderous strike, he had immediately captured the eldest prince\u2019s henchmen.He also quickly ordered Marquis Wu to recall his army back to the capital to defend. They had only just managed to return when the Grand Xia\u2019s army had arrived and encircled the capital.The fourth prince had gone out in front of the capital and faced hundreds of thousands of the Grand Xia\u2019s elite troops as calm as ever in order to negotiate, causing the Grand Xia\u2019s army to pause outside the city gates, allowing the commoners to escape having their blades wreck havoc on the city.When the commoners inside the city saw the fourth prince\u2019s suave and elegant manner, there were none who didn\u2019t feel admiration. That was the kind of boldness a ruler of an empire should have.\u201cAs for brother Changfeng\u2019s misfortune, Chu Xia is deeply apologetic. But luckily the heavens have blessed us and the criminals have already been arrested. I hope the blood of these people can comfort brother Changfeng\u2019s soul.\u201d The fourth prince \u2018regretfully\u2019 apologized to Xia Youyu.Xia Youyu\u2019s expression was a bit complicated. This man should be his sister\u2019s son, and he was truly a bit unwilling inside.He knew his son had died a wrongful death under the hands of this fourth prince Chu Xia. But he was unable to take revenge.That was because there had been someone who had ordered him not to harm even a single hair on his body. The reason he had brought these troops was also because of that person\u2019s order. This was all just a play written by Chu Xia.\u201cSeeing Your Majesty Youyu\u2019s manner, which has yet to recover from the loss of your son, Chu Xia has truly sensed His Majesty\u2019s strong paternal love for brother Changfeng. The loss of brother Changfeng at such a young age truly does cause one to sigh.\u201d The fourth prince shook his head.Xia Youyu narrowed his eyes, wishing he could slap this fake hypocrite. Even after killing his son, he now put on such an act. That was truly intolerable!But he didn\u2019t dare make a move. He knew that if he killed Chu Xia, he would definitely not have a good ending. He could only endure.\u201cCrown prince Chu Xia is too courteous. As long as I can kill my son\u2019s murderer, I believe Changfeng will be able to truly rest contentedly.\u201d Xia Youyu looked profoundly at Chu Xia. When he said \u2018murderer\u2019, a cold light flashed in his eyes.The fourth prince ignored that gaze, lightly saying, \u201cRest at ease, Your Majesty. The killers have been captured and can\u2019t run. But in order to maintain our two empires\u2019 friendship, a couple of sacrifices are unavoidable. Only by giving up a few prejudices and misunderstandings can two empires\u2019 people enjoy peace. Thinking back to the Grand Xia and Phoenix Cry\u2019s friendship, I must say that Your Majesty\u2019s vision truly is great. What do you say?\u201dXia Youyu finally understood that this chess piece he had set up all those years ago had already escaped his chessboard and was beginning to control him instead. The fourth prince\u2019s killing of Xia Changfeng was to tell him that this Chu Xia was no longer the old Chu Xia.If he wanted to continue controlling him, that would be a grave mistake. Even just the slightest carelessness might even bring about his own fall.The fourth prince\u2019s words immediately caused him to awaken from his grief. He nodded, \u201cCorrect, peace is the dream of the people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s entirely true. But peace must be built on a foundation of trust and equality. Those who would attempt to break our empires\u2019 peace must die.\u201dHe coldly smiled and look towards the eldest prince and his people. His smile suddenly disappeared and he harshly shouted, \u201cChu Yang, do you admit your crimes?!\u201dChu Yang, who was originally just lying there, was jolted suddenly and looked up into the sky, terrified. It seemed as if he was seeing some terrifying image, and he incessantly kowtowed.\u201cGuilty, I\u2019m guilty!\u201dHe repeated he was guilty over and over as he kowtowed, seeming to be full of remorse. But not a single person noticed that within the hair on the back of his head were three extremely thin needles.He wasn\u2019t the only one with needles in his head. The calm and slightly lifeless Empress Dowager also had such thin needles on the back of her head, but her hair blocked it so that no one could see.The fourth prince looked over everyone and coldly shouted, \u201cOur Phoenix Cry\u2019s eldest prince tried in vain to destroy the peace between our two nations. He threatened to throw our people into an abyss of torture. Death without pardon - kill!\u201dFollowing his cold order, the head executioner\u2019s blade fell.Blood flew everywhere. Over ten heads fell to the ground and dyed the earth red. Of the members of the Long household in the row behind them, over half of them fainted directly.The commoners watching from a distance closed their eyes in fright. It wasn\u2019t that they hadn\u2019t seen executions before, but they had never seen so many people executed for some heinous crimes.Furthermore, those people were all the highest officials of the empire, causing many of them to not be able to bear the sight. At the same time, their respect of the fourth prince only grew.Seeing all those people be executed, the fourth prince took a deep breath. He was too excited. He loved this feeling of control. Just a single thought on his part controlled the life and death of the people around him. That was the fascination of power.He looked towards the pale faces of the princes, princesses, and nobilities. The fear in their eyes was exactly what he had wanted to see.He would borrow this chance to clear out any other parties and make everyone acknowledge allegiance to him while making it so that they didn\u2019t dare rebel against him. He would become a king who ruled through complete power. Follow me and prosper; oppose me and die.\u201cThis is the result of disloyalty!\u201dThe fourth prince coldly looked up from those corpses and looked at the terrified expression of Mrs. Long.Her entire body was trembling now and she was filled with terror. She didn\u2019t faint, but just watched woodenly instead.\u201cMrs. Long, I\u2019m sorry. Long Chen committed such a huge offense that even I am unable to protect you. Don\u2019t blame me.\u201dAfter saying that, he regretfully waved his hand, causing a dozen executioner\u2019s blades to be pressed against their necks.\u201cBastards, you better stop for this master!\u201dSuddenly, a wild shout rang out and a group of people began to charge over to the execution stage.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 BrothersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: BornToBeThat was a group of seven people, and they were all holding weapons tightly. The person in the front was extremely large and wielding a sword in one of his hands.Behind him was one fat person and one thin person. The fat one was so big that people couldn\u2019t even tell if he was walking or rolling.As for the thin one, he was skin and bones, looking just like a chimp. They were both tightly holding the swords and following behind that person at the front.Everyone was completely shocked to see this group appear. Looking carefully, some people couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Shi Feng who won the competition during the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival?\u201d\u201cIt really is him! There\u2019s also the other two right behind him who I recall being very close to Long Chen!\u201d\u201cCould they be thinking of stopping the execution?\u201d said some people in disbelief. It was true that Shi Feng was a genius, most likely only second to Long Chen.But even so, he was only someone who had just advanced to the fifth Heavenstage of Blood Condensation, and he was only leading a group of insignificant Qi Condensation brats. This was no different than sending themselves off to die.\u201cThis is true brotherhood. I heard that Long Chen has given them many favors. They\u2019re probably doing this to repay him. Only such people are true men.\u201d Some people couldn\u2019t help but sigh regretfully about their deaths, but at the same time, they were filled with respect and admiration for them.This was basically a path of death they were walking. For them to do such a thing required more than just sheer courage.Looking at this group of people that had suddenly appeared, Chu Xia frowned. He knew that Shi Feng and them were extremely close to Long Chen.But he also knew that Shi Feng would be his generation\u2019s peak expert. He had hoped that he could pull him in and groom him as one of his subordinates. That was why they hadn\u2019t been implicated at all this time.However, he hadn\u2019t expected Shi Feng to be so bold and actually dare try to stop the execution with the top experts of both Phoenix Cry and the Grand Xia present.Before the fourth prince even said anything, there was already a group of soldiers which blocked their path.\u201cThose who try to block me will die!\u201d Shi Feng shouted angrily and raised his sword. He charged forward valiantly.\u201cCharge! Save brother Long\u2019s household!\u201d Fatty Yu also followed closely behind Shi Feng. With Shi Feng in the lead, their small group charged a squad of over a hundred elite soldiers.\u201cIf you dare keep coming forward, all of you will die!\u201d shouted the leader of the squad coldly when he saw that Shi Feng still didn\u2019t stop.In truth, he was actually being kind. He hoped Shi Feng would stop while he still could. In front of this many experts, there was not even the slightest chance of them succeeding, and so he tried to give Shi Feng and the others a path to survival.At the same time, he was also influenced by Shi Feng\u2019s loyalty that was unbending even in the face of death. His troops, which had seen blood before, admired such a brotherly camaraderie even more than the commoners.Unfortunately, he was disappointed to see that Shi Feng didn\u2019t stop at all, instead advancing even faster.Shi Feng raised his sword and heavily slashed it at that leader\u2019s spear. His power exploded and that squad leader, who was also at the mid stage of Blood Condensation, was forced back a dozen steps.That was definitely surprising. No one had expected Shi Feng to be so strong at such a young age. The squad leader quickly stabilized himself and pierced his spear at Shi Feng.Suddenly, Blood Qi exploded from Shi Feng\u2019s body. His mid Blood Condensation aura immediately erupted and his sword slashed down once more.That squad leader\u2019s arm turned numb and his hand split open. His spear was sent flying out dozens of meters away, and it continued to tremble incessantly even as it pierced the ground.He was completely astonished. Seeing Shi Feng continuing forward, he realized that he would be unable to resist in the slightest and he helplessly closed his eyes in the face face of death.However, that expected sword blow never fell. Instead, he felt himself being kicked tumbling into the distant. Although he appeared like a miserable figure, he wasn\u2019t really harmed.In just two moves, Shi Feng had defeated their strongest member. Those troops behind him couldn\u2019t help but become panicked. Seeing Shi Feng charging forward, they hastily raised their spears to block him.But those soldiers were only ordinary troops. Some of the weaker ones had even yet to enter Qi Condensation. It was impossible for them to block Shi Feng, and they were all sent flying.When Chu Xia saw that Shi Feng was so shockingly powerful, he frowned and waved his hand. \u201cStop them! Remember to capture Shi Feng alive!\u201dThe fourth prince\u2019s order caused three small squadrons to completely surround Shi Feng\u2019s group. Three mid Blood Condensation advanced forward to block him together.Shi Feng seemed possessed by a god of war. His sword danced through the air, and even one against three, he still didn\u2019t fall into a disadvantage. However, he was unable to advance any further.Fatty Yu and the others had been surrounded by the troops. They did not possess Shi Feng\u2019s combat abilities, and the strongest amongst them was only at the sixth Heavenstage of Qi Condensation.Most importantly, they had all been advancing by relying on their passion. In reality, their combat experience was essentially zero. As soon as they made contact, one of them was immediately heavily injured by a spear.Fatty Yu had only just blocked a spear when a second already reached his armpit, giving him a great fright.But that spear was sliced in two by Shi Feng who had been keeping an eye on them. Pushing back his opponents, he had returned to save fatty Yu\u2019s life.However, because he had been distracted, one of the squad leader\u2019s spear brushed across his shoulder, and blood slowly flowed out.\u201cBrothers, don\u2019t be afraid! Even if we die, twenty years from now, we\u2019ll still be remembered as heroes! Long Chen treats us as his brothers, and we can\u2019t let his household die in front of our eyes. Today, we choose death! If there is a next life, let us continue being brothers!\u201dShi Feng knew that today was already hopeless. This result was something he had long since known would happen.Originally, they were a group of nine people that followed Long Chen. They had already obtained favors from Long Chen, going from unwanted characters in the background to their families\u2019 most important members.All of that had been given to them by Long Chen. It was Long Chen that had changed their destinies.So, when the Long household ended up in a crisis, even though they knew their deaths would be doubtless, they had still come. They would use their passion as evidence of their camaraderie.Two of their original group of nine had fled when seeing those troops. Their eyes were filled with shame and remorse.They had once been a member of them, but they hadn\u2019t had the courage to come. When Shi Feng had brought up going to stop the execution, they had chosen to remain silent.But Shi Feng hadn\u2019t become angry and he didn\u2019t resent them. Instead, he told them to remember their brothers, and when they had time, to come to their graves to burn some incense and pour some alcohol for them.Xia Youyu saw that Shi Feng possessed a great potential and lightly said, \u201cJust now there was a person who said that those who would destroy the peace between our two empires could not be pardoned. It seems prince Chu Xia is still a bit soft-hearted. I\u2019ll help you out. Ha Qi, go kill those troublemakers.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dOne of the people behind him immediately floated over to Shi Feng like a wisp of smoke.Chu Xia\u2019s expression changed slightly. He knew Xia Youyu had seen through his intentions of recruiting Shi Feng. He was doing this as a revenge for his son. However, Chu Xia didn\u2019t move to stop this.He now realized that Shi Feng was an extremely unbending person. The odds of Chu Xia being able to convert him into one of his subordinates was not great. And so he didn\u2019t say a single thing in objection.Ha Qi\u2019s speed was extremely great, practically inconceivable. He traversed a distance of hundreds of meters in just a couple of blinks. Arriving beside Shi Feng, he sent a palm forward.Shi Feng, who was originally fighting three squad leaders, suddenly felt a shiver run through his body. A terrifying aura completely locked onto him.The four of them were astonished and stopped fighting immediately. A terrifying palm wind descended, and they quickly blocked it.BANG!Shi Feng had been the first to realize something was wrong. He wasn\u2019t like those three who stupidly stood still to block it, but instead quickly retreated.However, he was still scraped by that palm wind and he became like a kite whose string had been cut, tumbling back dozens of meters and spitting out blood.Now looking back to that spot, those three squad leaders, who had been fighting with him, were now unrecognizable as their corpses lay on the ground. Their bones had all been shattered and their auras had disappeared.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. I guess that was a bit too strong.\u201d Ha Qi smiled slightly. However, that apology of his was not the least bit apologetic.The battle completely stopped. All of them were stupefied by this sudden change. Looking at those corpses that didn\u2019t even have human form anymore, everyone was silent for a long time.Those were their squad leaders at the mid Blood Condensation realm! All three of them had been killed by a single palm; how could that not be appalling?\u201cA Tendon Transformation expert!\u201dFinally, someone let out an alarmed cry. Only a Tendon Transformation expert could so easily kill the three of them.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chu Xia\u2019s expression sunk. How could he possibly not realize that Xia Youyu had done this on purpose to embarrass him?\u201cAh, what an unexpected mishap. After all, a Tendon Transformation expert is also human, and fists do not have eyes. No one can guarantee anything in the midst of battle. I think that prince Chu Xia should be able to understand this. What do you think?\u201d smiled Xia Youyu.He had purposely told Ha Qi to do this. He wanted to tell this nephew of his that although he had that person\u2019s support, he wouldn\u2019t be able to support him for a lifetime. So he should be more reserved and not so excessive.How could the fourth prince not understand Xia Youyu\u2019s meaning? He was full of fury, but he didn\u2019t make a move. Instead, he was recording this hatred in his heart.After Shi Feng spat out a mouthful of blood, he slowly stood back up. Even in the face of a Tendon Transformation expert, he didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of retreat.\u201cShi Feng, quickly run! Don\u2019t sacrifice your life in vain!\u201d Mrs. Long couldn\u2019t bear to see him send himself to die for nothing.Shi Feng didn\u2019t reply. In fact, none of the others replied either. Other than one person that was too heavily wounded, the others all stood behind Shi Feng, facing against Ha Qi together.A cruel smile appeared on Ha Qi\u2019s face. \u201cExcellent, you guys really are smart. Dying one by one really is worse than dying altogether. I\u2019ll help finish all of you off quickly!\u201dHa Qi laughed coldly and stamped his foot. Veins appeared on his fist as though vines were under his skin. He smashed his fist into Shi Feng.Many of the Phoenix Cry Empire\u2019s people, whether it was soldiers or commoners, couldn\u2019t watch as Shi Feng and the rest were smashed into pulp, and so they all closed their eyes.Suddenly, the sound of a sword being unsheathed rang through the air. A cold light flashed in the air as a sword slashed down upon Ha Qi.You can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With his experience, a grave sense of danger filled himHe forcibly changed the direction of his fist to punch to the left.BANG! Ha Qi\u2019s fist blocked the sword, but the powerful force behind the sword still forced him back several steps, shocking him.Hastily stabilizing himself, he saw a young woman in long robes. Her hair was in a high bun, her phoenix eyes contained true power, and the edge of her sword rippled like water. She possessed an unspeakable grandeur.\u201cThird princess?!\u201d Shi Feng and the others let out a startled cry. That sword-bearing woman was Phoenix Cry\u2019s third princess, Chu Yao.\u201cYou guys be careful and don\u2019t be reckless. We have to stall until Long Chen returns,\u201d whispered Chu Yao to them quietly.Shi Feng slowly nodded. Two of them bent down to help their companion who had been heavily wounded. The right side of his stomach had been impaled by a spear, and he was already on his last breaths.Shi Feng quickly took out a medicinal pill and gave it to him. Although this wouldn\u2019t let him recover, it would be able to keep him alive for a while longer so that he wouldn\u2019t immediately die.Although everyone had already made their resolve regarding their deaths, naturally if they didn\u2019t have to die, they wouldn\u2019t want to. Seeing that Chu Yao was actually able to force back a Tendon Transformation expert, a slight hope ignited inside them.Chu Yao\u2019s appearance shocked everyone, including Xia Youyu and Chu Xia. They were all looking at her in disbelief.Xia Youyu immediately thought of something and said with complete shock, \u201cYou\u2019ve broken the Nine Dragon Sealing Field?\u201dChu Yao tightened her grip on her sword and pointed it at Xia Youyu. \u201cYou contemptible bastards, today I\u2019ll make you pay for your sins!\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t know what the Nine Dragon Sealing Field was, it was obvious that he was talking about the nine foreign spiritual qi seeds that had been in her Dantian.If it hadn\u2019t been for Long Chen, her life would have become incomparably tragic. She would have become a tool used by others without even her knowledge. Thinking of that, her fury blazed.\u201cHmph, looking at your aura, you\u2019ve only just broken through to Tendon Transformation. You probably can\u2019t even properly control your own strength, yet you dare make such wild ravings? Ha Qi, capture her,\u201d ordered Xia Youyu with a sneer.The fourth prince was also looking at Chu Yao in shock. Her appearance caused his confidence to be shaken slightly. He was starting to feel a bit uneasy.Long Chen\u2019s face appeared in his mind. Even up until this day, he had yet to receive any further news of Long Chen. He was just like a permanent thorn in his side, and now that Chu Yao had appeared, that thorn became even bigger.\u201cHmph, let me test Phoenix Cry\u2019s princess.\u201d Ha Qi laughed. Veins popped up all over his body, and his terrifying aura advanced another level as he punched out.Before he had even arrived, just the wind from his fist caused her hair and clothes to blow back. Ha Qi had now clearly exploded with his true Tendon Transformation power.Chu Yao didn\u2019t face Ha Qi\u2019s fist head-on. Instead, she was sliding her feet to dodge and stabbing her sword towards his throat.Ha Qi laughed coldly and didn\u2019t dodge. A light-yellow light appeared on his other hand and he swatted away Chu Yao\u2019s sword.Chu Yao felt a huge force send her flying, and she also felt intense pain from her hand.Xia Youyu was completely correct. Chu Yao had only just advanced into the Tendon Transformation realm, and furthermore, her advancement had been done in secret since she hadn\u2019t dared to let anyone else find out.And she was also helpless that after advancing, she hadn\u2019t had any chance to test her strength. So her control over her own power was limited.Now that she was facing a Tendon Transformation expert who had already experienced hundreds of battles, she immediately fell into a disadvantage. That was especially true since she had almost zero combat experience.\u201cHmph, an empty realm is all you have. Give me your life!\u201d Ha Qi sneered. Without giving any damns about her gender, he sent a punch smashing at her.Just as Chu Yao was preparing to forcefully block it, a red ball of light suddenly flew over and collided with his punch.BOOM! Ha Qi felt as if his fist had been enveloped by lava and was immediately forced back.\u201cBeing so ruthless to a young woman, don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u201d An aged voice rang out as a figure appeared in front of everyone.\u201cGrandmaster Yun Qi?\u201d Chu Yao couldn\u2019t help but celebrate that grandmaster Yun Qi had finally come out at this critical moment.\u201cYun Qi, as an alchemist guild chairman, in compliance with the alchemist treaty, you cannot meddle in secular matters. Are you not afraid of the guild\u2019s punishment?\u201d shouted Xia Youyu coldly.\u201cYou are correct; a guild chairman cannot participate in worldly matters.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi laughed slightly and suddenly turned his head. \u201cSun Nian!\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201d In a distant crowd was a middle-aged man in Pill Apprentice robes who hastily walked out and respectfully bowed.Grandmaster Yun Qi waved his hand, sending something flying over. When Sun Nian saw what that was, his expression immediately changed.\u201cSun Nian, I hand the guild signboard to you. You are the new guild chairman,\u201d said grandmaster Yun Qi.\u201cGuild chairman\u2026\u201d Sun Nian was completely shocked.Grandmaster Yun Qi cut him off. \u201cI am no longer the guild chairman. Our guild\u2019s rules cannot be ignored. If you still think of me as the guild chairman, then you cannot stop me from removing myself as guild chairman.\u201dSun Nian looked at the guild signboard in his hand and didn\u2019t know what to do. But he realized that a major event was about to occur.\u201cNow I am no longer a member of the alchemist guild and have the qualifications to participate in secular matters,\u201d said grandmaster Yun Qi lightly.No one would have imagined that grandmaster Yun Qi would actually remove himself from the guild for the Long household. Without his status as a guild chairman, then even if someone killed him, no one would be able to investigate it.\u201cThat is true. I\u2019ve waited a long time for this day. Yun Qi, as expected, you haven\u2019t let me down.\u201dTwo people walked out from the crowd, and when people saw one of them in particular, many let out startled cries.\u201cWei Cang!\u201dThat was grandmaster Wei Cang who was equally famous as grandmaster Yun Qi. Everyone could tell that there was intense hatred between the two of them from the time they had exchanged blows at the Phoenix Cry Lantern Festival.But both of them had kept things in reserve back then. It was practically just a symbolic fight without any display of their true strength.Now hearing what grandmaster Wei Cang said, it seemed grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s appearance today was entirely in his expectations. Perhaps a truly great battle would be fought today.\u201cWho\u2019s the other old guy?\u201d\u201cI know! That\u2019s Wang Luyang, another Pill Master.\u201d That was a person who had attended the Huayun Pavilion\u2019s auction, and so he recognized him.During the auction, Wang Luyang had been low-key all the way until the final Flesh Bone Restoration Pills appeared. Only then did he shock everyone, leaving behind a deep impression.The fact that he was standing together with Wei Cang today was rather interesting.Despite seeing Wei Cang appear, no change appeared on grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s face. He glanced at Wang Luyang. \u201cHave you thought this through?\u201dWang Luyang smiled slightly. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to become enemies with grandmaster Yun Qi, but I couldn\u2019t help but accept brother Wei\u2019s kindness. So, I can only offend you.\u201d\u201cStop with the crap Yun Qi. Hand over that thing, otherwise, I\u2019ll send you to hell right now,\u201d said Wei Cang icily. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve separated from the alchemist guild, you no longer have a support to rely on. I don\u2019t need to have any misgivings about killing you.\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi looked at the fourth prince with a complicated expression. \u201cFourth prince truly is a dragon amongst men. Your scheming truly causes me to admire you.\u201dThe fourth prince smiled slightly. \u201cGrandmaster\u2019s praise makes this youngster blush.\u201d\u201cSince fourth prince is so proficient in scheming, I wonder if he has heard of a certain expression?\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi asked lightly.\u201cWhat expression? Please give me some pointers senior.\u201d\u201cMan proposes but God disposes.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi smiled slightly.The fourth prince narrowed his eyes. He didn\u2019t know why, but hearing that caused his heart to jump a bit.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cFourth prince is smart, so how could you not even understand such a common proverb? Or are you afraid to admit that you know what it means?\u201d asked Yun Qi.The fourth prince\u2019s expression changed slightly. His scheme had definitely been completely flawless, but unforeseen incidents continued to pop up.The first mishap was that Marquis Ying had failed to kill Long Chen. Although Marquis Ying had said that Long Chen was already heavily wounded and was most likely unable to survive, he still continued to feel that Long Chen wouldn\u2019t die so easily, and so he had sent the Savage Marquis to search for him.The second mishap was that Chu Yao had managed to silently resolve the Nine Dragon Sealing Field in her body and broken through to the Tendon Transformation realm.Although she had only just broken through and wasn\u2019t worth fearing yet, it was still something unexpected. That caused him to feel as if the situation wasn\u2019t as sure as he had thought.And now grandmaster Yun Qi was still as calm as ever despite knowing he had stepped in a deathtrap. That caused him to feel even more uneasy, and he even felt a bit of fear.He had been born to be just a chess piece. Then finally, he managed to escape that chess board. Now that it was his turn to control the board, he definitely didn\u2019t want his own chess pieces to be escaping from him.\u201cYour plans are laughable. Just for some resources, you wasted so much time. So stupid.\u201d Grandmaster Yun Qi shook his head.That truly made the fourth prince\u2019s expression change greatly. He looked at grandmaster Yun Qi in disbelief. \u201cYou actually knew?\u201dGrandmaster Yun Qi smiled slightly, but he didn\u2019t respond.The fourth prince glanced over at the distant crowds and immediately calmed himself down. He coldly laughed, \u201cIn the face of death, it seems you\u2019ve taken to spouting nonsense. Grandmaster Wei Cang, what are you still waiting for?\u201dWei Cang smiled. \u201cWell, he\u2019s an old friend I\u2019ve kept up with for dozens of years. Before I send this friend on his way, I have to give him some time to say his final words first. Well, it looks like he\u2019s finished anyway, so I\u2019ll get going.\u201dFlames completely wrapped around Wei Cang\u2019s body. A blazing spear appeared in his hands, and he was practically just a human-shaped blaze as he charged at Yun Qi, bringing with him a terrifyingly high temperature.Wang Luyang also summoned flame armor and a sword. They pincered Yun Qi on both sides.That terrifyingly high temperature caused space to distort. The heat made the air ripple around them, making them practically illusionary.Suddenly, Yun Qi\u2019s eyes brightened and he actually smiled. The person who he had been waiting for had finally arrived. It was time to resolve his grudges.BOOM! Yun Qi\u2019s arms shook and a terrifying red blaze arose. Rolling waves of heat spread in every direction, roasting Wei Cang.\u201cWei Cang, give me your life!\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A blazing flame spear three meters long appeared in his hands. It contained an endless destructive will that wished to exterminate the land and slash apart the heavens.The weapons in their hands weren\u2019t really weapons, but Pill Flame that had been compressed to the peak and taken shape outside of their body. They were also called flame weapons.That was a Pill Cultivator\u2019s life flame. It was the condensation of all their lifetime\u2019s effort. Its destructive power was unparalleled. It was said that if it was refined to the absolute highest realm, then it would be able to burn the heavens and vaporize the seas.The first reaction of Wei Cang and Wang Luyang was a complete shock. Their blazing weapons hastily went to block the attack.When their three flame weapons collided, everyone saw a bright light explode in front of them that made them blind. Only then did they hear an incredible explosion, and waves of heat caused them to feel as if they were in a furnace.Shi Feng and the others\u2019 expressions greatly changed. They were the closest to this battle, just thirty or so meters away. Even just the aftershocks from that battle would be able to completely roast them.But even though they wanted to retreat, it was already too late. It was at that time that a sword stabbed into the ground in front of them.Shi Feng and the others immediately saw the sky darken and a wave of earth completely covered them.When Shi Feng finally managed to dig his way out of that boiling earth, he noticed that everything in a radius of three hundred meters had already turned into scorched land that was emitting scalding steam as well as an unpleasant smell.\u201cYou guys retreat. Don\u2019t get involved anymore.\u201dChu Yao\u2019s voice rang in their ears. It was she who had saved them just now. She was unable to block that kind of heat, and so she had quick-wittedly raised the earth to protect Shi Feng and them.With a heavy layer of earth covering them, they had managed to survive that first attack. Otherwise, even if they didn\u2019t die, they would still have been heavily injured.Shi Feng\u2019s group quickly retreated. Just a few hundred meters behind them was the execution stage. But they didn\u2019t dare go over there right now. That was because there were executioners there, and they were afraid the fourth prince would suddenly order the executions of the entire Long household if they were hasty.No matter how fast they were, they would be unable to save them from those executioners or even flee themselves. And so they couldn\u2019t blindly rush over there.BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! Explosive ringing continued as waves of blazing heat spread. Ordinary people could only see a sky full of flames and were unable to see what was happening within that blaze.Only Blood Condensation experts with their powerful eyesight could see those three human-shaped flames that were continuously colliding.\u201cSo last time you were hiding your true strength!\u201d After exchanging several blows, Wei Cang and Wang Luyang had been repeatedly forced back. Wei Cang\u2019s expression sunk as he finally realized the truth.\u201cNo need for useless words. Today, the worthless lives of you two will completely end,\u201d shouted Yun Qi coldly. His entire spiritual qi was pushed to the max as his attacks became even more ruthless and sharper, forcing the two of them to repeatedly retreat.Everyone was completely stupefied. This was a fight between Pill Masters? It was practically a battle between flame gods. Other experts were unable to even approach, let alone participate in the fight.Before they would even be able to attack, they would already be roasted into coal. Pill cultivators truly were terrifying and completely unstoppable.Grandmaster Yun Qi was able to force them back repeatedly while fighting one on two. Although Wang Luyang and Wei Cang were both Pill Masters, in terms of their Pill Flame, they were obviously inferior to grandmaster Yun Qi and not just by a bit. Both of them couldn\u2019t help but be alarmed.At the same time as he was filled with shock, Wei Cang also couldn\u2019t help but thank his luck. He hadn\u2019t expected Yun Qi to have hidden himself so deeply. If it had been one on one, the results would have been disastrous for himself.The power of their three Pill Flames was extremely great. Despite exchanging over thirty consecutive blows, their auras didn\u2019t show the slightest signs of becoming exhausted. Although Wei Cang and Wang Luyang were at a disadvantage, the fight was still at a stalemate for a while.\u201cLittle girl, this time there will be no one to save you. Die!\u201dHa Qi suddenly laughed sinisterly and charged at Chu Yao who was watching the fight from a distance. If Yun Qi had not interfered before, he would have already killed her.Now seeing that there was no one else in his way, he immediately charged at her.But he had only just moved when he sensed a strange stream of air. Relying on his life and death experiences, he immediately stopped.A cold light shot past him with a splash of blood. That was an arrow that had brushed against his nose. If Ha Qi had been even the slightest bit slower in reacting, his head would have been pierced.\u201cCan my Long family\u2019s daughter-in-law be bullied by the likes of you?\u201dA deep and resounding voice spread throughout the entire battlefield. It shook everyone\u2019s hearts, as the voice contained an extreme contempt and killing intent.Everyone was completely shocked. They had been completely focused on Yun Qi\u2019s battle, but at some point, three more figures had appeared on the battlefield.The person at the front was a tall man with a lion\u2019s nose, a wide mouth, and sword-like eyebrows. He appeared incredibly powerful. His cheeks were so sharp that they seemed to have been carved with a knife, and an icy killing intent soared from him.\u201cLong Tianxiao!\u201dThat was one of three top experts of the empire, the Border Suppression Marquis Long Tianxiao who was praised as the strongest man in all of Phoenix Cry!Whether it was the troops on the side of Phoenix Cry or the Grand Xia, everyone\u2019s hearts were jumping wildly. They were completely pressured by just his imposing manner.He had almost killed a Tendon Transformation expert with just a single arrow. Just what kind of strength was that? His title of military god was definitely not meaningless.Only after people exclaimed did Chu Yao realize that this was Long Chen\u2019s father. But for Long Tianxiao to address her as \u2018daughter-in-law\u2019 made her face completely red. However, a warm feeling filled her heart as well.He drew back his bow again, and another arrow shot out like lightning straight towards the execution stage. The arrow reached them practically as soon as it left the string.What awed everyone was that after that one arrow was shot out, all the executioners standing behind Mrs. Long and the others all toppled to the ground. Only then did people realize that a small hole had appeared on each of their foreheads.The entire field was deathly silent. Long Tianxiao\u2019s archery skill was too amazing for them to even comprehend. With just a single arrow, he killed over twenty people who were all standing in different places.\u201cHe truly is worthy of being called the strongest man of Phoenix Cry. That explosive arrow technique has practically reached the realm of perfection,\u201d praised Xia Youyu.Only Tendon Transformation experts were able to see through the profundities of Long Tianxiao\u2019s arrow just now. In reality, Long Tianxiao had used his spiritual qi to break down the arrow the moment it left the bowstring.Once the arrow was shot forward, it scattered into pieces to become over twenty thinner arrows that killed those executioners.But although they could comprehend this, there was no one else that was capable of such a thing other than Long Tianxiao. His arrows were enough to strike fear in the hearts of the barbarian tribes. Who knew just how many of their experts had fallen to him?It was rumored that this archery skill had been created by Long Tianxiao. Today, everyone learned the terror behind that one arrow.Since Long Tianxiao\u2019s arrow had killed all the executioners, Chu Yao, Shi Feng, and the others all rushed over to Mrs. Long and the rest of the Long household\u2019s side. They untied their bindings and brought them to stand behind Long Tianxiao.Long Tianxiao slowly turned around and looked at his haggard wife. He quietly whispered, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve caused you to suffer.\u201dMrs. Long shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s us who have burdened you. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know\u2026 Chen-er, he\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t continue. If even they had ended up like this, then Long Chen\u2019s situation was probably even worse.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Chen-er will be fine. How could my, Long Tianxiao\u2019s, son be defeated so easily?\u201d He comforted his wife.He then turned to look at Chu Yao and nodded in satisfaction. \u201cBut that kid really does have good eyesight. He brought such a good daughter-in-law back to my Long family.\u201dChu Yao immediately blushed and her voice was minute as she said, \u201cChu Yao greets uncle Long.\u201dLong Tianxiao laughed heartily. Then turning to Shi Feng, he patted him on the shoulders. \u201cWell done.\u201dBeing praised by the strongest person in Phoenix Cry filled Shi Feng with excitement. Just what kind of honor was that? Fatty Yu and the others also looked up to Long Tianxiao with worship.Even in front of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers from both empires, Long Tianxiao still acted normally, as if not even placing them in his eyes. He took action to kill without the slightest misgivings. Just what kind of boldness was that?But when Long Tianxiao looked at the half-unconscious Wilde, his expression sunk.\u201cHusband, are Wilde\u2019s wounds urgent?\u201d Mrs. Long trembled.Long Tianxiao didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he told Chu Yao and the others to take care of everyone. He then turned to Yun Qi who was fighting fiercely and nodded.Within Long Chen\u2019s letters was a detailed description of the current situation in the capital. It was even more detailed than his own reports.\u201cLong Tianxiao, your son Long Chen committed a capital offense, and for both empires\u201dLong Tianxiao waved his hand to cut off the fourth prince. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make your fake hypocritical speech. I, Long Tianxiao, don\u2019t like plotting, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am a fool. So what if you set up some traps? I\u2019ve still come. If you want to kill my Long household\u2019s people, then just come. Let me see just how many of your lives will remain afterwards.\u201dLong Tianxiao\u2019s words were said extremely emotionlessly, but they still somehow seemed to drip with blood. His meaning was clear; he wasn\u2019t suicidal in coming here to their trap, but if he did die, he would bring them down with him.As for exactly who would be brought down with him and how many people, that was something people could only wonder.Every person there felt a cold chill run down their backs. Even the heat coming from that battle far away was unable to stop that chilliness.Long Tianxiao stood alone against layers of troops, giving off a feeling that he could not be shaken.Mrs. Long was filled with warmth when she looked upon that familiar back. Twenty years ago, she was precisely attracted by his imposing manner that looked down upon the whole world.Looking at him, she also thought of a slim figure. Although he wasn\u2019t so muscular, he had once also said that he would become like his father, a true hero.Seeing that Long Tianxiao was able to rely just on his imposing manner to completely pressure everyone, Marquis Ying\u2019s eyes were filled with jealousy and hate.Unsheathing his sword, Marquis Ying charged over, his sword pointed at Long Tianxiao. \u201cLong Tianxiao, today my sword will repay that grudge of my finger from all those years ago!\u201dLong Tianxiao cast a glance at Marquis Ying and indifferently said, \u201cWho are you again?\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Long Tianxiao actually acted as if he didn\u2019t recognize him?! That was the greatest possible insult and humiliation for him!He had challenged Long Tianxiao several times back in the day, all of them which resulted in his loss. In the last one, Long Tianxiao had severed one of his fingers, which was the greatest disgrace of his entire life.At this time, Marquis Ying had already obtained the Flesh Bone Restoration Pill and grown back that finger. That had returned his tendons to a perfect state, and he had advanced from the sixth Heavenstage to the seventh Heavenstage of Tendon Transformation, stepping into the late stage.Although it was just one Heavenstage\u2019s difference, that was also the large step between the mid and late stage. Now that he had advanced to the late stage, his combat ability had soared, and he was now completely confident and prepared to challenge Long Tianxiao again.Before he had had the chance to challenge him, he had received the order to go kill Long Chen on that day. The result of which was that he had been continuously thwarted by Long Chen, almost losing his life in the end. That had greatly shaken his confidence.And now from just one sentence from Long Tianxiao, his anger completely burst and he was unable to endure it any longer. With an angry roar, he charged at Long Tianxiao.The two of them had been separated by almost three hundred meters, but Marquis Ying closed the gap in just three steps.On his first step, veins popped up all over his body and terrifying energy exploded from him. On the second step, he raised his sword up high, his qi pouring into the sword and the wind whistling around it.On his third step, he suddenly sped up. His mind, spirit, and qi all merged together as his sword fell, perfectly raising his power to its absolute pinnacle.It could be said that although Marquis Ying was infuriated, it went without saying that he was a true expert. That was something that even the Tendon Transformation experts of the Grand Xia had to admit.Seeing Marquis Ying charge over, Long Tianxiao merely shook his head. \u201cEven after ten years, you still haven\u2019t grown the slightest bit. You want to defeat me with just yourself?\u201dA saber had appeared in Long Tianxiao\u2019s hand all of a sudden. When he unsheathed it, its cold light shined everywhere.But just when everyone thought Long Tianxiao would send a slash out to block, he instead took a single step back. That one step placed him three meters away.Marquis Ying almost spat out blood. His striking point was originally perfect. But now his full force blow had nowhere to release its power. It was as though he had used his full power in an attempt to cut apart a rock, only to have that rock become a soft piece of tofu. That kind of feeling of using the wrong amount of power was extremely uncomfortable.Marquis Ying\u2019s sword landed on nothing but air. Knowing the situation had taken a turn for the worse, he was about to switch moves when Long Tianxiao stepped in, slashing with his saber. Saber images appeared throughout the air.BOOM! But Marquis Ying was still a Tendon Transformation expert. In that extremely unfavorable position, he was still able to forcibly use his qi to take on Long Tianxiao\u2019s blade.Marquis Ying was like a skipping stone as he tumbled dozens of meters away before stopping.As soon as he stabilized, he immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. That sudden blow and block had shaken his inner organs, causing him to be injured.Everyone was astonished. Marquis Ying, who was also one of the three peak experts of Phoenix Cry, was unable to completely block even a single slash of Long Tianxiao\u2019s.Xia Youyu and the others might also be surprised, but they weren\u2019t too shocked. Long Tianxiao\u2019s attack just now had been set up almost perfectly.He had exquisitely found the perfect moment between the moment when Marquis Ying had used up his force on nothing but had yet to gather his energy again. Attacking at that moment had caused Marquis Ying to suffer a loss.That didn\u2019t mean that Marquis Ying\u2019s cultivation base was inferior to Long Tianxiao\u2019s, but that Marquis Ying\u2019s combat ability was far too lacking in comparison.Marquis Ying had stayed in seclusion training for the last couple of years. Whenever he met anyone, it would always be someone weaker and he would forcibly suppress them. He would first lock his enemies in place before sending out a powerful blow.But today he had been enraged and forgotten that Long Tianxiao was also a late Tendon Transformation expert. His realm was actually greater than his own, so how could it be possible for him to lock him in place? And so that was why he had suffered so greatly.\u201cYing Zhao, you\u2019re going to use only this level of strength to fight against me?\u201d Long Tianxiao shook his head indifferently.Marquis Ying\u2019s face turned ashen from rage. He had been careless and caught unprepared. Although the injury wasn\u2019t anything major, it definitely had impacted his confidence and spirit. For a moment, all he could do was grind his teeth in anger.\u201cThe Border Suppression Marquis Long Tianxiao has rebelled. All troops are ordered to work together to capture this rebel!\u201d the fourth prince ordered coldly.Following the fourth prince\u2019s cry, there were immediately dozens of squads that charged over. Those people were obviously his trusted agents who listened to his orders without the slightest hesitation.As for the other officers who were still shaken by the situation, when they saw that there were already people charging over, they also stopped hesitating. One by one, they all began to charge over at Long Tianxiao.\u201cPhoenix Cry brothers, we all grew up together on this land. I don\u2019t want to see my brothers\u2019 blood. Don\u2019t force me!\u201d Long Tianxiao\u2019s shout rang out.His shout was backed up with his spiritual qi and shook the entire sky. There were immediately several people who paused.They were all army men, and Long Tianxiao was their idol. Just how many people wanted to be like him and be called a military god?But now they were supposed to point their weapons at this idol. That caused many soldiers to be at a loss.\u201cDon\u2019t listen to his misleading lies! As long as you kill a single traitor, no matter their status, you will immediately receive one million gold coins and be promoted three nobility ranks!\u201d cried the fourth prince.Hearing that, some of those hesitating soldiers immediately gave up their internal struggle and charged forward, brandishing their weapons.Ever since the day they had joined the army, they had been repeatedly taught that soldiers didn\u2019t need to think. All they needed to do was to follow orders.And with such a huge enticement, those people all followed their instincts. But they didn\u2019t have any intentions of attacking Long Tianxiao. After all, that was an impossible-to-complete mission.Luckily, other than Long Tianxiao, there were also over twenty random members of his household. Killing one of them would be too simple. A million gold coins and a three rank promotion in nobility rank were temptations only few could resist.Seeing the tide-like army rushing over, Long Tianxiao sighed. \u201cHave free rein to kill them.\u201dThe other two people who had come with Long Tianxiao nodded. Placing Mrs. Long and the others between the two, they raised their swords towards the charging army.Sword-light flashed. Limbs flew everywhere, and a rain of blood fell.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re Tendon Transformation experts!\u201dThe fourth prince\u2019s expression changed. The two people that Long Tianxiao had brought were also Tendon Transformation experts! That was completely out of his expectations.He had long since investigated Long Tianxiao\u2019s bottom line strength perfectly. How could there suddenly be two new Tendon Transformation experts?!But what he didn\u2019t know was that that was Long Chen\u2019s contribution. The Breaking Barrier Pills, which Long Chen had sent back with Chen Fei, had resulted in three people successfully advancing to the Tendon Transformation realm.The remaining people hadn\u2019t broken through, but they could already sense the barrier much clearer now. It shouldn\u2019t be long before they could also break through.That had absolutely delighted Long Tianxiao. From Long Chen\u2019s letter, he learned that the undercurrents in the imperial capital were about to reach a critical moment at any time and that he should make his preparations.After just considering it for a moment, Long Tianxiao collected his whole force stealthily and approached the barbarian tribes. But he had been surprised to see that the barbarians tribes had also been collecting in order to prepare for a huge battle.However, since he had noticed this, he had immediately brought those three Tendon Transformation experts to the huge barbarian army that numbered in the hundreds of thousands. With four Tendon Transformation experts attacking, plus the fact they were launching a sneak attack, the barbarian army suffered a huge loss. The majority of their army was killed, and the rest fled deep into the mountains. Although there was no way to chase, it was enough to intimidate them from ever coming back again.That was the greatest victory ever gained over the barbarian army. Having massacred hundreds of thousands of barbarians, everyone was fired up.As soon as he had won this victory, he had received news from the capital that the Long household was to be executed.After thinking it over for a moment, Long Tianxiao still decided to leave behind one Tendon Transformation expert as a guard and brought the other two rushing back to the capital in order to save them.If he ended up bringing away all the experts, then on the off-chance that the barbarian tribes once more gathered together, the border might really not be able to defend without a single Tendon Transformation expert guarding it.That was why Long Tianxiao had only brought two of them. Although the two had only just broken through to the Tendon Transformation realm, they were people who had fought alongside Long Tianxiao for many years and their battle experience was extremely great. Their combat strength was such that those so-called \u2018elite troops\u2019 of the capital were just a bunch of slow-moving ants that could be swatted away with their eyes closed.Those two Tendon Transformation experts took the vanguard, slaughtering the charging army. Chu Yao and Shi Feng guarded the rear. If any fish managed to slip through their net, they would be able to easily kill them.As for fatty Yu, Shou Hou, and the others, they were standing right alongside Mrs. Long and the others as guards. However, there was basically no chance for them to do anything as of yet.As for Long Tianxiao, he was now surrounded by three Tendon Transformation experts. They were Marquis Ying, Marquis Wu, and a Tendon Transformation expert from the Grand Xia.The first Tendon Transformation expert, who had been shot through the nose by Long Tianxiao\u2019s arrow, had returned to his own camp in order to recuperate.That was because without his nose, his senses were greatly affected. It was not just his sense of smell; the distraction of the loss of his nose slowed down all his other senses as well. On the battlefield, that handicap could easily result in Long Tianxiao killing him in a single blow. Tendon Transformation experts were an extremely precious military strength that no one would easily sacrifice.But no one had expected just how overwhelming Long Tianxiao was. Even one against three, he was still beating them. That Grand Xia expert was almost cut in half by his blade. He had only been saved luckily by Marquis Wu.Even one against three, he was still as valiant as ever, forcing back his opponents and making them fear for their lives. That caused everyone to recognize that the only one worthy of being Phoenix Cry\u2019s strongest man was Long Tianxiao.As for grandmaster Yun Qi\u2019s battle with Wei Cang and Wang Luyang, that was also nearing its climax. It was becoming more and more intense and dangerous. But they were far away from this battlefield, and their ripples didn\u2019t reach that far.The most dangerous spot still had to be Mrs. Long\u2019s side. The imperial capital\u2019s soldiers seemed to have become insane. They charged forward, unafraid of death, for that reward. They were hopeful that as long as they managed to kill a single person from the Long household, their careers would soar higher than ever.Despite the two Tendon Transformation experts fighting as hard as they could, despite the mountains of corpses that littered the ground, the locust-like army was still unstoppable. Fatty Yu and the others also had to start fighting with their lives on the lines. Danger sprung up from all sides, and they were gradually becoming unable to hang on.As for Marquis Ying\u2019s group of three, no matter how hard they fought, they were still powerless to deal with Long Tianxiao. Marquis Ying couldn\u2019t help being shaken, and a spear suddenly appeared in his hand.That spear was shot out just like a shooting star towards Mrs. Long\u2019s group, its power completely unblockable.\u201cLong Tianxiao, first I\u2019ll kill your wife and let you also taste the flavor of resentment!\u201d Hatred and resentment twisted Marquis Ying\u2019s face.Long Tianxiao hadn\u2019t expected Marquis Ying to suddenly make such a dirty attack. Those two Tendon Transformation experts were completely caught up with trying to block the huge army, and the others were all surrounded. No one else had noticed that spear yet.And even if someone did notice it, it would be useless. In front of a Tendon Transformation expert\u2019s attack, there was basically no one who could block it in the Blood Condensation realm.Chu Yao was the first member on that side to notice the spear. Her expression greatly changed. It was already too late to push Mrs. Long aside. She directly rushed in front of her, actually using her own body to take that spear.\u201cNO!\u201d Long Tianxiao roared. That spear contained a Tendon Transformation expert\u2019s full force. It was something that the physical body could not possibly block. The both of them would be killed!BANG!A ray of black light flashed. That spear was turned into powder by a terrifying force. When the smoke and ashes scattered, a pitch-black broadsword appeared in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.That black broadsword was in the hands of a youth. His robes fluttered and his long hair danced.\u201cI guess this counts as making it on time.\u201dYou can also listen on wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
