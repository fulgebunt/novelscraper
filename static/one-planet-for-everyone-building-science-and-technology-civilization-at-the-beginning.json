    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: One Planet for Everyone!\u201cDid you read the news? Just now, the Goddess of Bu successfully awakened her planet, reaching a diameter of 33 kilometers, setting a new historical record for our River City!\u201d\u201cF*ck, is that true?\u201d\u201cThis strong? As expected of the number one genius of our River City.\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, with a diameter of more than 30 km, converting this into high-grade energy should be easy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. It\u2019s even possible to convert it into spirit energy.\u201d\u201cSpirit energy? That\u2019s a planet of cultivation!\u201d\u201cSigh, let alone a planet of cultivation, I would be satisfied if I could create a planet of martial artists.\u201d\u2014Seven Middle Schools of River City!Outside the Awakening Room, a group of young students was discussing in whispers.Today was the day of awakening.From time to time, all sorts of shocking news would come.Everyone\u2019s expressions were different. Some were excited, some were envious, some were nervous, some had a calm expression\u2026Outside the crowd, Jiang Fan looked at everything calmly.He had transmigrated here for more than half a year.He was already used to this strange world.Here, as long as he reached the age of eighteen, he would have the chance to awaken a planet and transform it into origin energy.Furthermore, he could create various Transcendent civilizations on the planet.Someone had converted their origin energy to create a card civilization. Everyone on the planet was a card user.There were people who had transformed their origin energy into a soul civilization. Everyone on the planet was a soul cultivator.Someone had converted origin energy to create a cultivation civilization. Everyone on the planet was a cultivator.\u2014Awakened successfully.At best, he could have a territory that belonged to him. He would become a master.If the awakening failed, he could only be a commoner for the rest of his life.Probably working for another planet lord. There would be no chance to climb up.It could be said to be able to step into heaven, one must risk taking a step into hell.For everyone, this was the most important day!Hua la\u2026The door to the awakening chamber opened.The first batch of awakened students walked out.Their expressions were different.The face that had successfully awakened was filled with excitement and joy.Those who failed were dejected.A few girls even cried.\u201cSecond batch of awakening students, prepare to enter,\u201d the teacher at the door glanced at the people queuing behind him and shouted.The students outside began to stand up straight.Jiang Fan was also in the second batch.Following the stream of people, they entered the Awakening Room.In the Awakening Room, everyone settled down.More or less, they were nervous.In front of everyone, there was a transparent round crystal ball.\u201cThis is a crystal ball specially used for awakening. It contains a portion of origin energy.\u201dThe teacher in charge of awakening said,\u201d Later on, put your hands on the crystal ball. Once you awaken, the origin energy will flow into your bodies bit by bit.\u201d\u201cDuring this time, you will be able to awaken a planet.\u201cBut\u2026\u201cIf the source energy is used up and the planet is yet to awaken, then the awakening will end. The awakening will be declared a failure!\u201cNext, please prepare yourselves.\u201d The Awakening Teacher glanced at everyone.Everyone put their hands on the crystal ball in front of them.Jiang Fan was no exception.He took a deep breath.His right hand slowly moved forward.He gently touched the crystal ball.Jiang Fan was nervous.After all\u2026This was the only chance for the planet to awaken.The size of the awakened planet would determine the potential of each planet.The bigger the planet was, the easier it was to convert high-level energy.For example, magic power, star power, origin energy\u2026There was even the possibility of spirit energy.If the planet was small, it could only be converted into low-level energy.For example, true energy, astral energy, perception, and so on.\u201cIf I want to convert high-level energy, the diameter of the planet should be at least 15 kilometers.\u201cIf it\u2019s less than 15 kilometers, then\u2026\u201cMost likely, it\u2019s a low-level energy. It can only be used to create civilizations like fighters or cards.\u201d Jiang Fan thought to himself.\u2014-\u201cAwakening begin!\u201dAs soon as the Awakening Teacher finished speaking, strange energy flowed out from the crystal ball.Through Jiang Fan\u2019s right palm, it slowly merged into his body.A moment later, Jiang Fan found himself in his mind.Suddenly, a blurry space appeared.This space was filled with chaos. There were no objects. From top to bottom, left and right, it gave off an air of emptiness.It was as if the universe had just opened.\u201cIs this the awakening space?\u201d Jiang Fan knew.Later, a planet would be born in this space.He observed the awakening space for a while.After confirming that there were no problems.Jiang Fan began to calm down and concentrate.He concentrated on awakening the planet.The time he could awaken was only a few minutes.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Planet Civilization\u2019s Choice!The process of awakening the planet was not complicated.It would not last long. It all depended on everyone\u2019s talent.A few minutes passed, Jiang Fan slowly opened his eyes.A hint of joy appeared on his face!He could clearly feel it.Within the Awakened Space, in nothingness, a yellow dot appeared.This yellow dot was growing at a speed visible to the naked eye.Its appearance gradually became clearer.It was a sphere.Jiang Fan knew. This was the planet he had awakened.It was like a cell growing into an embryo.However, time was much faster.About five minutes passed. The planet slowly took shape.This was a planet with an earthen yellow surface.He quietly floated in the awakening space.But\u2026The next moment, when Jiang Fan saw the size of the planet, his expression changed slightly.This was an extremely small planet.It looked less than a kilometer in diameter.What was this concept?It was even smaller than some slightly larger squares.\u201cTrue enough\u2026\u201d Jiang Fan felt helpless.During the normal simulation test, Jiang Fan\u2019s results were not very good.It could be said to be average. It was not easy to awaken a planet.A smaller diameter was very normal.\u201cSuch a small planet, let alone high-level energy, even low-level energy would be hard to convert.\u201d Jiang Fan thought.Awakening a planet was just the beginning.A planet in the complete sense was a planet of life.Life had to be born.Only then could it be considered a successful awakening.It was divided into three steps.Step 1: Awakening a planet.Step 2: Convert the origin energy into all kinds of energy.Step 3: Catalyze life.He completed these three steps.When there\u2019s the birth of life on the planet, it could be considered a true awakening.The birth of life was closely related to energy.The higher the energy level of the planet, the higher the probability of life being born.And the energy came from the transformation of the origin energy.The bigger the planet was.The higher the probability of origin energy converting into advanced energy.And energy was divided into ordinary energy and extraordinary energy.Extraordinary energy refers to True qi, vitality, magic power, battle qi, origin power, spiritual energy, and so on.Ordinary energy was ordinary energy. For example, light energy, wind energy, electric energy, geothermal energy, chemical energy, and so on.Normal energy could also give birth to life.But the probability was very small.Moreover, they would be born of ordinary life. There was no potential.It looked like Jiang Fan\u2019s awakened planet was less than a kilometer in diameter.The probability was even lower.It was almost impossible to give birth to life.Which meant\u2026 Awakening failed!!\u2014Inside the patrol room.The school leaders as well as the class teachers and teachers of each class gathered together.They were paying attention to the most important awakening ceremony of the year.All of them looked calm, but their heart was even more nervous than the students in the awakening room.After all\u2026 this was related to the school\u2019s results.If there were many successful students and the planets were large, the school would also benefit greatly.Their fame would rise.It would also be easier to recruit students next year.\u201cNumber 17 has successfully awakened. The diameter of the planet is 8 kilometers.\u201d\u201cNumber 28 has successfully awakened. The diameter of the planet is 13.5 kilometers.\u201d\u201cNumber 33 has successfully awakened. The diameter of the planet is 7.2 kilometers.\u201d\u2014As time passed, one after another, voices were heard.\u201cExaminee #8, planet diameter 28.5 kilometers!\u201d a teacher shouted.Instantly, it attracted a lot of attention.\u201c28.5 Kilometers?\u201d\u201cThis is one of the top geniuses.\u201d\u201cWhich class is this?\u201d\u201cIt seems to be Class 1. Class 1\u2019s results are really good.\u201d\u2014The principal nodded slightly as he listened to the discussion.This year\u2019s results were considered very good.Two students with a diameter of more than 25 kilometers had appeared.\u201cCandidate 81, planet diameter\u2026 0.81 Km?!\u201dA teacher read the result of Jiang Fan\u2019s awakening.\u201c0.81 Km? It\u2019s less than a kilometer, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be hard to even give birth to life.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not even afraid. According to the previous records of the Federation, the diameter of the planet is less than one kilometer, although there is still a theoretical possibility, no one has ever successfully born life.\u201d\u201cWhat a pity.\u201dThe teachers shook their heads and sighed.Not too surprised.In the previous years\u2019 awakening results, the diameter of the planet that was less than 1 km was not a minority.\u2014\u201cSuch a small planet, it\u2019s almost impossible to give birth to life. If I can\u2019t give life to a planet, then it means that you failed to awaken. In the future, I can only become a commoner.\u201d Inside the awakening room, Jiang Fan felt a little unwilling.Once life could not be born, this meant that the awakening had failed.He would never have another chance in the future.It was impossible to change fate.Jiang Fan came from an ordinary family.If he did not successfully awaken a planet, he could only work for other planet owners!It was not much different from the farmers who sold their bodies to the landlords in ancient times.Ding dong!At this moment.A strange voice sounded in Jiang Fan\u2019s mind.\u3010I detected that the host is awakening a planet, the god-level deduction system is activated.\u3011Jiang Fan was stunned for a moment before he reacted.The System?!You finally came!He immediately looked into his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: One of Three! My choice\u2026 Technology civilization!In his mind, a panel appeared.Planet Name: NonePlanet Level: 0Planet diameter: 0.81 kmPlanet species: 0Deduction route: None\u2014After everyone successfully awakened the planet, there was a planet data panel.The difference was, a \u201cdeduction route\u201d appeared on Jiang Fan\u2019s screen.It was obviously a product of the System.Jiang Fan looked at it carefully and asked, \u201cSystem, the deduction route is determined by me?\u201dThe System did not reply.It was a tacit agreement.\u201cSystem, help me deduce the path of life on this planet,\u201d Jiang Fan thought for a moment and said.A moment later. A few lines appeared on the panel.Path of deduction: Birth of life on the planetDeduction result:Convert origin energy into Extraordinary Energy, and then catalyze life. Success rate: 0.01%; Convert origin energy into Normal Energy, and then catalyze life. Success rate:0.1%; Convert origin energy into light energy, and then perfect the surrounding environment of the planet, creating a good cradle for the birth of life. Over time, slowly wait for the birth of life. Success rate: 99%.A total of three deduction routes appeared on the panel.Jiang Fan looked.\u201cThe probability of converting the origin energy into Extraordinary Energy is only 0.01.\u201cEven if it is converted into Ordinary Energy, there is almost no chance of life being born.\u201dHe saw the first two routes, Jiang Fan was not surprised at all.In the third type, there was a 99% chance.This was almost a certainty.What he saw was somewhat mysterious.It was to allow the planet to generate its own life.\u201cPerfect the environment around the planet and allow life to be born on its own, would that be the same as Earth in his previous life?!\u201d Looking at the third deduction route, Jiang Fan could not help but raise his eyebrows.\u201cThe planet that just awakened is equivalent to a lifeless place, just like Saturn and Mars.\u201d Jiang Fan thought to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s just that this world has origin energy. It can be converted into spiritual energy and other strange extraordinary energy. It can directly catalyze a life.\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for Mars to automatically produce life.\u201dJiang Fan could not help but think of the original Earth.Earth was the only living planet that humans had discovered in the previous universe.Even so, the birth of life on Earth was also the result of various coincidences.Earth had a history of 4.6 billion years.It was not until 500 to 500 million years that life was born.It could be said, the birth of life was a miracle!\u201cThe third route given by the System is similar to Earth.\u201dJiang Fan could not help but think, \u201cFrom the process of life on Earth, we need water, suitable sunlight, temperature, and the atmosphere. Only then can life be born and developed, but\u2026\u201cThese conditions are not so easy to satisfy.\u201d\u201cWater, suitable sunlight, temperature, atmosphere, etc.\u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to creating an environment on Mars in my previous life, and then allowing Mars to automatically generate life!\u201cThis is almost impossible.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the deduction system, I definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out what kind of degree is appropriate!\u201dFor this world, this method was simply impossible.Thousands of years of planet awakening.There were only a few ways to create life.The most common and best used\u2026 It was to convert the origin energy into extraordinary energy.Under the catalyst of Extraordinary Energy, a planet would easily give birth to life.Moreover, there was a \u00a0probability of an Extraordinary being being born.The more advanced the born life was, the stronger the vitality of the planet, the better the future!If it was an ordinary life form, naturally, the development potential could not be compared to the planet where supernatural beings were born.\u201cIf I use the third route to produce life, it should be an ordinary life.\u201d Jiang Fan thought of this.There was no unwillingness in his heart. But there was also a trace of excitement.After all\u2026This was a life born naturally, without much interference from external forces.If it was the way life was born in the past.It was like putting spiritual energy into Mars.It would simply and roughly catalyze life.This method could quickly give birth to life. But it was still artificially created.It was equivalent to creating an ecosystem.After that, he had to take care of it all the time.One mistake, the ecosystem would collapse.If life was born naturally, after that, it was just like Earth from his previous life.There would be more and more lives, so Jiang Fan did not need to take care of them.One was an artificial ecosystem!One was the natural ecosystem!Which was better.One could tell at a single glance!\u201cAlthough the probability of life born from this route was that of ordinary life, its development potential would not be any weaker than those planets that were catalyzed by extraordinary energy, and even\u2026 even stronger!\u201dAlthough ordinary life could not develop an Extraordinary civilization, there was still technology.Jiang Fan could create a technological civilization.If the technological civilization had developed to a certain level, it would not be inferior to those extraordinary civilizations.Even\u2026 stronger!!In Jiang Fan\u2019s memory, many science fiction works from his previous life described the shocking level of technology in the future.For example, in the technology of the god-class civilization. A drop of water could pierce through the entire Starfleet.A two-way foil could turn the entire Solar System into a piece of paper.And two-way foil. It was only the simplest cleaning tool in the god-class technology civilization.Above the god-class technology civilization, there were even more powerful existences.It was no exaggeration to say that the development of science had no end!Thinking of this, Jiang Fan made a decision. But in reality, Jiang Fan had no choice now.The third route had a 99% success rate. It was almost a certainty.\u201cSystem, use the third deduction route to help me deduce the various conditions for the birth of life,\u201d Jiang Fan ordered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Planet Evolution!Soon, the results of the deduction came out!Water, suitable sunlight, temperature, atmosphere, and other data appeared in Jiang Fan\u2019s mind.Jiang Fan looked.At the same time, he was observing the condition of the planet he had just awakened.This earth-yellow planet was no different from most newly awakened planets.On the surface, it was mostly sand and stones. The temperature was below zero. It was extremely cold.There were no traces of water.The environment was rather harsh. It was not suitable for living. Naturally, it was impossible to give birth to life.According to the data given by the System, Jiang Fan began to modify.The first was the appropriate temperature and sunlight.Originally, Earth had the existence of the sun, so it had this condition.In the Awakened Space, there was only one small planet.Fortunately, there was origin energy in this world.It could be converted into all kinds of energy.Jiang Fan directly converted the origin energy into light energy. It was the creation of an artificial sun. The size, position, and distance of this artificial sun. It was set according to the deduction data.In the awakening space, outside the yellow planet, a golden energy ball appeared.It looked like a glowing star.In reality, it was just an energy body that was converted from the origin energy.The artificial sun was born.Jiang Fan realized that half of his origin energy had been consumed.Jiang Fan heaved a sigh of relief.Inside the artificial sun was a nuclear fusion reaction. Light energy, an ordinary energy, was produced.If it was converted into Extraordinary energy, then the origin energy would be consumed even more.Under the sunlight, the temperature on the surface of the yellow planet began to rise bit by bit.Following this trend, he would be able to go from negative to positive soon.The problem of temperature and sunlight was solved.Next, Jiang Fan began to deal with the problem of the atmosphere and water.As the owner of this small planet, Jiang Fan had the greatest authority.Just like the creator, he could modify his own planet at will. But\u2026If there was no divine level deduction system, a newborn planet was like a newborn baby.It was extremely fragile. One modification that was not good could collapse a planet.Even\u2026 resulting in death.\u2014The setting of the atmosphere was relatively simple.Jiang Fan quickly set it up.As for water. It was slightly troublesome.However, with the help of origin energy. Jiang Fan converted hydrogen and oxygen. Step by step, he synthesized a portion of water.On the earthen planet. It was gradually covered by water. The surface of the planet slowly changed color.In the end, it became a small ocean. Land occupied only a small portion.Other aspects. Jiang Fan had adjusted the gravity, magnetic field, crustal movement, and so on.It was the same as Earth in his previous life.The birth of life was a relatively long process.After setting according to the system\u2019s deduction data, the shape and environment of this planet were already perfect.Compared to Earth in his previous life, it was not worse. However, the birth of life still required time.The System\u2019s deduction time was about 100 million years.According to lore, the time flow in the Awakened Space was the same as the real time flow outside.One to one.In other words, if he really had to wait for the birth of life, it would take over 100 million years.Jiang Fan would not be able to live another ten lifetimes.Fortunately, the origin energy could accelerate time!Jiang Fan did not hesitate.He used less than half of his origin energy.Time acceleration of awakening space.1 To 10.1 To 100.1 To 10,000.1 To 100 million!\u2014Until it accelerated to 1 to 1 trillion!Jiang Fan stopped.As long as there was enough origin energy.Theoretically, it could be accelerated infinitely.But not many people would do that.Other planets were equivalent to an artificial ecosystem.Not to mention accelerating. He couldn\u2019t take care of it all day.It was possible that some unexpected accidents might occur. This would cause the ecosystem to collapse!For example, there was a student. After the birth of life, he did not take care of him for a few days. The result, the planet\u2019s ecology collapsed. All its life was gone!This caused the planet to degenerate. It became a dead star.The student was also demoted from the planet master to become a commoner.\u2014During this extremely fast acceleration process, the entire planet underwent a drastic change.In a hundred million years, the sun continued to shine on the surface of the planet.The surface temperature slowly rose.It rose to an extremely high number. The crust slowly moved.In the sky, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled!There were clouds piling up. There was heavy rain drifting down. The shape of the land also changed greatly.In the small ocean, the water temperature was high.Various gases began to appear.For example, reducing gas, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and so on.These gases formed organic molecules.As time passed, some small molecules of organic compounds began to dehydrate.Gradually synthesizing proteins.Through thermal polymerization, the small molecules formed organic polymers such as protein, polysaccharide, nucleic acid, etc!Protein was the main substance that formed an organism.Polysaccharides, sugars, and so on were the skeletons that formed many cells, the main components of the cell wall.There was also nucleic acid as genetic material.These organic macromolecules are beginning to evolve into primitive single cells!These are the three parts of the birth of life\u2014First, gases synthesized small organic molecules.Second, small organic molecules were synthesized into organic polymers.Third, organic polymers evolved into primitive single-celled life.It looked simple. But to be natural, it\u2019s like the parts of a dump were automatically assembled into a car.The odds were slim.It could only be described as a miracle among miracles.Even with system help, this process still took a hundred million years.Of course, at a time flow rate of 1 trillion.It was less than an hour outside.Finally\u2026In a body of water at a high temperature.The first life on the planet was born.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: First Life! Birth!In a hot spring with boiling water.A microorganism that could adapt to high temperatures was born\u2014Thermophilic bacteria!Although it was just a tiny bacterium, but it could also be considered a creatureMeaning\u2026 This small planet, which was less than a kilometer long, gave birth to the first life.To become a real life planet. This represented the successful awakening of the planetJiang Fan became a planet master.Seeing this tiny thermophilic bacterium, Jiang Fan heaved a sigh of relief!At the same time, Jiang Fan noticed that the panel in his mind had also changed\u2014\u3010Planet Name: NonePlanet level:1(The newly born planet is extremely fragile and unstable. If one is careless, it would disappear like a meteor.)Planet diameter:0.9 km(The size of the planet depends on the life force of the planet. The stronger the life force, the larger the planet.)Planet species: 1Deduction route: None\u3011\u2014\u201cThe diameter of the planet is a little more?\u201d Jiang Fan raised his eyebrows.It was not too strange.The size of a planet completely depended on the life of a planet.The so-called life depended on the following three aspects\u2014\u2014Life level of the planet.For example, humans were considered high-level life forms.It provided more life than a lion.A lion\u2019s health level was higher than a grass.Naturally, the life force provided was even more.And so on.As for the lowest level of life like thermophilic bacteria, their life force was pitifully low.Number of life on the planet.The more life, the stronger the life force of the planet.Planet species richness.The richer the planet, the higher their life force.\u2014Now, Jiang Fan only had one life on this planet. It was also the lowest-grade microorganism. Naturally, there wasn\u2019t much life force.A planet over a kilometer in diameter. Putting it outside, it could be said that it was the lowest existence.But Jiang Fan was not in a hurry. The evolution of this planet had just begun. The birth of thermophilic bacteria was only the first step. There would be more and more life after that!\u201cI\u2019ll name the planet Blue Star first.\u201dJiang Fan looked at the planet and found a familiar name.The surface of the planet was no longer earthy yellow.Instead, most of the area was covered by the ocean.It was slightly blue.It\u2019s name was Blue Star!Jiang Fan checked.He discovered that there was still a quarter of the origin energy left.Origin energy was very expensive outside.Ordinary families could not afford it.Only when awakened, only the authorities would provide one free copy.Jiang Fan did not want to waste it. He continued to consume the remaining energy to speed up the evolution of Blue Star.As the owner of this planet, Jiang Fan could clearly sense all the changes happening on the planet.Inside the warm ocean, the number of thermophilic bacteria slowly increased.As time passed, other microorganisms began to appear.The first ones were the same as thermophilic bacteria, the lowest grade Prokaryote.Time continued to pass. Prokaryotes evolved into protozoa. It was still the most primitive, simplest, and lowest creature.However, the structure and functions had changed a lot.A protozoan called Cyanophyta, it evolved a characteristic that allowed photosynthesis.This kind of algae had strong adaptability.It could endure high temperatures, freezing, lack of oxygen, dryness, high salinity, strong radiation, and other harsh environments.Algae and some bacteria continued to photosynthesize. They created a large amount of oxygen.For the birth of a higher-level life, it provided sufficient conditions.At the same time in the ocean, there were some eukaryotic creatures with real nuclei, such as primitive sponges and jellyfish-like creatures.This also represented the birth of real animals and plants.Animals and plants were higher-level creatures.It could bring extraordinary life force to the planet. Due to the increase in life force. The planet was also gradually growing bigger!At this point, three hundred million years had passed since the birth of the planet.Other than the evolution of life. There were also huge changes on the surface of the planet.There was more and more water.The oxygen content slowly increased.The land gradually disappeared. Almost all of them were submerged by the ocean. All creatures were born in the ocean.Due to the good environment Jiang Fan had set up, the development of the species was much faster than Earth in his previous life.At this stage, Jiang Fan had no choice but to stop because the origin energy had been completely exhausted!Jiang Fan could only stop the acceleration of the planet. The size of the planet had also taken shape. From the very beginning, it was less than a kilometer. Now, it had grown to its current size.In his mind, the panel data was shown\u2014\u2014\u3010Planet Name: Blue StarPlanet Level: Level 1Planet diameter: 35.2 kmPlanet species: 215 (does not include microorganisms and other lower life forms. There is no further notification.)Deduction route: None\u3011\u2014Even though they were all normal life forms, there were many different types and numbers.It provided a lot of life force. The size of the entire planet had skyrocketed to a shocking level. Those Extraordinary stars outside. Despite their high level, the quantity and variety were far inferior.To the newly awakened Extraordinary planet, to be able to have five or six species, one could be considered a genius.Use quantity to supplement quality. This was Jiang Fan\u2019s strategy.At the same time, the awakening of the others outside was also coming to an end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Final Results!When he awakened, the origin energy was exhausted.This represented the end of the awakening.When Jiang Fan left the Awakened Space, he saw that most of the student awakening ceremony was over.Some were cheering and jumping, very excited. Some of their faces were filled with frustration, and they even wept bitterly. There was also complicated expressions. He did not know if they were happy or sad!\u2014All life, the success rate of planet awakening was not 100%.Plus, some planets that had successfully awakened were too small.There was almost no development potential. Therefore, only a few people were satisfied with the results.Extraordinary energy was divided into four levels: low, middle, high, and super.Low-level energy.There were: True Qi, Spirit, Perception, Telekinesis, and so on.Middle energy.Mainly: Vitality, Combat Aura, Soul Energy, etc.High energy.There were mainly: Origin energy, Dragon Qi, Magic Power, Star Power, psionic energy, and so on.Super energy.There were mainly: spiritual energy, nuclear energy, void energy, and so on.The higher the energy level, the rarer it was.Among all the students who had successfully awakened, the amount of low-level energy converted was the highest.Intermediate energy was secondary.High-level energy could be counted on one hand.And super energy could only depend on luck.\u2014At the same time, inside the patrol room, the teachers were doing the final statistics!The awakening planet was only the first step.The key was to give birth to life on the planet. The first step of many people went smoothly. However, the problem was step 2.\u201cNumber 1 awakened successfully, the final diameter of the planet is 11 km.\u201d\u201cNumber 2 awakened successfully, the final diameter of the planet is 12.6 km.\u201d\u201cNumber 3 failed to awaken.\u201d\u201cNumber 4 failed to awaken.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cNumber 38 awakened successfully, the final diameter of the planet is 23 kilometers.\u201d\u2026\u2026The final results of the students were read out.Including those who had awakened successfully and those who had not. The school leader and the teachers at the side looked satisfied.The headmaster nodded slightly and said, \u201cThis time, the students\u2019 results are not bad. More than half of the students have successfully awakened a planet. Especially Tang Qingqing and Xiang Junhao. The diameter of their awakened planets are more than 25 kilometers.\u201d\u201cAlthough they couldn\u2019t compare to the top students of a secondary school, two top geniuses appeared at once. This result\u2026 we can also be ranked,\u201d vice principal chimed in.The others nodded in agreement.According to the general rules.Those with a diameter of more than 20 kilometers could be called geniuses.Those over 25 kilometers were considered top geniuses.The probability of producing high-level energy was very high.Those over 30 kilometers were super geniuses.The transformation of high-level energy was almost certain.If nothing unexpected happened, they could successfully build a high-level civilization.There was a high probability that they could convert origin energy into super energy.And over 35 kilometers\u2026 it was called a monster!The probability of producing super energy was very high.Forget about River City, even Dongyang Province where River City was located, there were very few!An unknown school like River City 7th Middle School, two top geniuses appeared.It was already the best result for the past five years.It was enough to make every leader happy.\u201cNumber 81 awakened successfully, the final planet diameter\u2026 35.2 Kilometers?!\u201dAt this moment, the teacher\u2019s voice suddenly became sharp.The patrol room suddenly fell silent.All of them looked at the teacher strangely.35.2 Kilometers?!This\u2026 How is that possible?One had to know.The female student who had a shocking talent in the previous middle school only awakened a planet with a diameter of 33 kilometers.This also broke the historical record of River City.More than 35 kilometers. However, that was considered a monster.\u201cAre you sure\u2026 Are you sure?\u201dThe principal stared at the teacher who announced the results and his tone suddenly became nervous.\u201cHeadmaster, see for yourself.\u201dThe teacher who announced the results pointed at the screen in front of him.On the big screen, Jiang Fan\u2019s awakening result was very large.There was no doubt.One by one, the school leaders and teachers thought. They all felt that it was inconceivable and absurd.They weren\u2019t a first-rate school. There was actually a genius student who broke the record.\u201cIt really is 35.2!\u201d\u201cReally is! Our school actually produced a genius with a diameter of more than 35 kilometers?!\u201d\u201cWhich class is this Jiang Fan from? He\u2019s hiding something.\u201d\u201cIt seems to be Class 2. Class 2\u2019s results are pretty good.\u201d\u2014Listening to everyone\u2019s discussion.The principal waved his hand and said in a loud and clear voice, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it for now. Quickly announce the final results.\u201d\u201cThe principal is right, I\u2019ll do it now.\u201d A vice-principal personally ran to take charge.They had been silent for so many years.It wasn\u2019t easy to produce such a shocking result.Naturally, they had to publicize it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Miracle! A new record!Soon, the last student had awakened.The door of the awakening room opened. The students rushed out impatiently.Jiang Fan followed behind. He walked out of the awakening room.Once he came out, he saw a handsome boy surrounded by people.The surrounding people were discussing.\u201cThe diameter of the planet awakened by Junhao is actually 28.5 kilometers?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s similar to Tang Qingqing.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Brother Hao.\u201d\u201cBrother Hao, you should be called Young Master Hao.\u201d\u2014All kinds of praise and praise came in succession.However, the people surrounding him were not the biggest.It was a beautiful girl with a ponytail and a tall figure.Jiang Fan naturally knew this girl\u2014Tang Qingqing!She was recognized as a school belle by the Seventh Middle School. She was the Long-term number one!\u201cQingqing, congratulations. This time, you were able to awaken a planet with a diameter of 29.8 kilometers.\u201dThe teacher in charge of maintaining order walked over to congratulate him.\u201cThank you, teacher. I\u2019ve just been lucky,\u201d Tang Qingqing said modestly.But there was a hint of arrogance in her eyes.\u201cEveryone.\u201d At this moment, a vice principal walked over.The crowd suddenly quieted down. Everyone looked.The vice principal glanced at everyone, nodded slightly, and said loudly, \u201cThis time the awakening ceremony is successfully completed. Our school\u2019s results are not bad, more than half successfully awakened a planet. Among them\u2026\u201cThere are 210 people with a diameter of more than 10 kilometers.\u201cThere are 23 planets with a diameter of more than 20 kilometers.\u201cThere are two people with a diameter of more than 25 kilometers. They are Tang Qingqing and Xiang Junhao from Class 1.\u201dThe Vice Principal\u2019s voice fell.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to Tang Qingqing and Xiang Junhao.The two of them instantly became the focus.The discussion that had already stopped started again.\u201cMore than 25 kilometers, wouldn\u2019t that be entering the ranks of top geniuses?\u201d\u201cWe have two top geniuses this time?\u201d\u201cAmazing.\u201dHowever, the Vice Principal\u2019s words were not finished.Tang Qingqing and Xiang Junhao paused for a moment.Then, he raised his voice and continued, \u201cI want to congratulate Class 2\u2019s Jiang Fan. During this ceremony, the diameter of the awakened planet exceeded 30 kilometers! 35.2 Kilometers!\u201cHe broke the record set by a student not long ago!\u201cHe created a new history in River City!!\u201d???Hearing the Vice Principal\u2019s words, everyone\u2019s first reaction was that they heard wrong!There was actually a student with a diameter of more than 30 kilometers?!Or more than 35 kilometers?In the history of the school, there had never been such a result before.What was even more exaggerated was that it even surpassed the publicly acknowledged proud daughter of the heavens?!Thar\u2026 How was that possible?And it also exceeded 35 kilometers. He would immediately enter the ranks of geniuses.Shua, shua, shua\u2026Instantly, everyone turned their heads.Their gazes landed on Jiang Fan. All of them had different expressions. Some exclaimed. Some were envious. Some were inconceivable. Some were confused.But no one was jealous.The people present did not even dare to dream of getting such results.Xiang Junhao and Tang Qingqing looked a little unnatural.Both of them had awakened more than 25 kilometers of planets.They had achieved the best result in the past five years.But\u2026In front of Jiang Fan\u2019s 35.2 kilometers, they were overshadowed.Originally, it was only their moment of glory. Now, it was Jiang Fan\u2019s alone.\u201cI originally thought there was no opponent in this school. I didn\u2019t expect\u2026\u201d Tang Qingqing stared at Jiang Fan, her fingers slightly clenched in her palm as she thought to herself, \u201cI will meet such a hidden guy, but\u2026\u201cThe size of the initial planet is nothing.\u201cWhat\u2019s really important is the subsequent creation of civilization.\u201d\u2014\u201cJiang Fan, come with me.\u201d The vice principal waved at Jiang Fan.He left the scene with Jiang Fan. They went all the way to the teaching building and arrived in front of an office.\u201cPrincipal\u2019s office?\u201d Jiang Fan looked at the sign outside the office and raised his eyebrows.\u201cGo in, the principal is waiting for you.\u201d The vice principal smiled. Then he turned around and left.Jiang Fan knocked on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201d A dignified voice came from inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Reward! The school\u2019s goodwill!Jiang Fan pushed the door open and entered. He could see it at a glance.Sitting behind the desk, a man around 50 years of age with a rather dignified appearance.It was the headmaster of River City Seventh Middle School\u2014Tong Zhensheng!A level 4 planet lord with extraordinary strength.At this moment, Tong Zhensheng\u2019s voice was no longer as dignified as before.He put on a friendly smile. He stood up and said amiably, \u201cStudent Jiang Fan is here. Come, sit on the sofa over there.\u201d\u201cPrincipal Zheng.\u201d Jiang Fan had lived two lives.He was not restrained. He sat down next to the sofa.Seeing Jiang Fan\u2019s calm expression, Tong Zhensheng nodded inwardly.He was neither arrogant nor impatient. No wonder he could suddenly charge out and become a dark horse.\u201cJiang Fan.\u201d Tong Zhensheng looked at Jiang Fan and said, \u201cFirst of all, congratulations on taking the first place in our school\u2019s awakening. It is also a new record for River City.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d For these, Jiang Fan did not mind.Tong Zhensheng was not a formalistic leader. After a short exchange of greetings, he went straight to the point.\u201cAccording to the rules of our school, since your awakening result is first,\u201d Tong Zhensheng smiled and said, \u201cWe will give you 500,000 federal dollars.\u201d\u201c500,000?\u201d Jiang Fan\u2019s eyes narrowed.What was his identity? He had been an orphan since he was young. He had grown up with the help of the Federation.500,000. For Jiang Fan, naturally, it was a huge sum of money. And, his planet was different from other people who had successfully awakened.Jiang Fan had created a natural and ecological planet.Theoretically, he did not need too many resources.As long as he had enough origin energy, which was very expensive, he would be good. An official price of 1 million federal dollars was needed to buy origin energy.With Jiang Fan\u2019s wealth, he couldn\u2019t afford it!\u201cPlus your results this time, you\u2019ve broken River City\u2019s historical record, so\u2026\u201d Tong Zhensheng continued, \u201cThe school has decided to give an additional 500,000.\u201dTaken together, a million in total.It was just enough for a portion of origin energy.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Thinking of this, Jiang Fan looked at Tong Zhenshen and said, \u201cThese rewards, can you\u2026 I want to exchange it for origin energy.\u201dAlthough the price of origin energy was one million, that was the official price.If he was to buy it himself, since he had no connections or channels, that was not the fixed price.Since there was a chance, Jiang Fan was not polite.\u201cEn?\u201d Tong Zhensheng did not care about these details. Instead, he looked at Jiang Fan in confusion and asked, \u201cDo you want to trade it to origin energy? You don\u2019t consider using this money to buy other planet resources first?\u201dAs usual, since his planet had just awakened, he had to cultivate more life first.All kinds of resources were needed to cultivate life. For example, buying extraordinary life plants and animals. Those were needed on the planet as the food for intelligent life. These required a large amount of money.\u201cLet\u2019s trade it to origin energy first. The energy on my planet is a bit special,\u201d Jiang Fan smiled and said.\u201cSure, I just happen to have a portion of origin energy, so I\u2019ll give it to you as a reward.\u201d Tong Zhensheng stood up.From the drawer of the desk, he took out a packaging box.Inside the box, it was a transparent crystal ball. There was origin energy.Tong Zhensheng understood Jiang Fan\u2019s thoughts. However, he did not care. Instead, there was even more appreciation.To become a powerful planet lord, it was better to have thicker skin.Jiang Fan took it. He didn\u2019t immediately open it. Of course, he still had this bit of trust.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Jiang Fan, can you tell me, what is the initial energy of your awakening?\u201d Tong Zhensheng looked at Jiang Fan. He asked the question he was concerned about.The size of an awakened planet. It was just an appearance.Most importantly\u2026 was the level of the initial energy.Only at high levels would it be possible to create a high-level civilization.Planets with a diameter of more than 30 kilometers were usually advanced civilizations, even a super civilization was possible.Jiang Fan\u2019s planet was 35.2 kilometers in diameter. The probability was much higher.\u201cThe energy I awakened is somewhat special.\u201d Jiang Fan vaguely reminded.\u201cCould it be super energy? Or was it the rarer one? Void energy?\u201d Tong Zhenheng immediately guessed.There was a hint of anticipation in his eyes.In the super energy, spiritual energy was the most common. The rest were similar to the Void Energy. It was relatively rare.Throughout the history of the Seventh Middle School, a student who awakened a super energy had never appeared before.Now there was Jiang Fan. Naturally, Tong Zhenheng was looking forward to it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Headmaster\u2019s jaw dropped!\u201cI let the principal down. It\u2019s not super energy.\u201d Jiang Fan shook his head.\u201cNot super energy?\u201d Tong Zhensheng\u2019s eyes froze, but he immediately reacted and said,\u201d That\u2019s high-level energy. High-level energy isn\u2019t bad either. In the future, you can create a powerful high-level civilization.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not high-level energy,\u201d Jiang Fan said.Listening to Jiang Fan\u2019s answer, the smile on Tong Zhensheng\u2019s face froze.Logically speaking, Jiang Fan\u2019s awakened planet was over 35 kilometers in diameter.The probability of converting to super energy was very high.Even if his luck was bad, high-level energy should be guaranteed.Tong Zhensheng never thought about it.It was not even a high-level energy. Naturally, there was some imbalance in his heart.But he had been the principal for decades, it quickly returned to normal.After a brief silence, Tong Zhenshen looked at Jiang Fan and asked, \u201cIs it middle energy? It\u2019s not impossible to have middle energy. Many powerful intermediate civilizations are no less powerful than advanced civilizations.\u201d Tong Zhenshen\u2019s voice comforted himself somewhat reluctantly.With Jiang Fan\u2019s results and only then converting into intermediate energy.It was like first place in the college entrance exam went to a school that couldn\u2019t even rank 211.\u201cIt\u2019s not middle energy.\u201d Jiang Fan told the truth.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Tong Zhenshen was speechless for a long time.He did not know what to say.Not even intermediate energy.There was only low-level energy left.This made him not even know how to comfort him.\u201cLow-level energy is fine. With the size of your planet, you will have an advantage over others.\u201d Tong Zhenheng tried to comfort him.Although Jiang Fan\u2019s energy was not satisfactory, in the end, he was the first place.Tong Zhensheng still felt that there was potential.\u201cIt\u2019s not low-level energy.\u201d Jiang Fan was helpless, but he still told the truth. \u201cThe energy I converted is a little special, not extraordinary.\u201cIt\u2019s light energy.\u201cIt\u2019s just normal energy.\u201dPuff! Puff!Hearing this, Tong Zhenshen\u2019s body trembled.His hand trembled. The teapot he had just picked up trembled. He almost hit the table.Even though Tong Zhencheng was a level 4 planet lord, he had been the principal for decades.It could also be said that he had experienced great storms.But\u2026He was also shocked by Jiang Fan\u2019s words.You\u2019re a genius who broke River City\u2019s historical record.The transformed energy was not extraordinary energy? It was ordinary energy?!Saying it out loud, no one would believe it.One had to know, according to the previous records, the planets with normal energy were very small.The largest one did not exceed 15 kilometers. There was no such thing as Jiang Fan.It completely did not conform to the normal law of planet awakening, but Tong Zhensheng also knew Jiang Fan could not lie.This sort of thing, at that time, would be clear.\u201cPrincipal, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d Jiang Fan stood up and prepared to take his leave.\u201cSure, you can go back first.\u201d Tong Zhensheng did not know what to say.He had a sentence prepared. However, Jiang Fan\u2019s 'shocking\u201d news disrupted everything.\u2014After leaving the principal\u2019s office, Jiang Fan followed the stream of people.He left the school quietly.Outside the school gate, there were already many media outlets and people from all walks of life.Hearing the wind, he went out. Jiang Fan was in the crowd. He did not attract much attention. He went straight back to his home.Jiang Fan was an orphan. It was a relief room in the Federation.Upon returning home, Jiang Fan could not wait to open the crystal ball that he had just obtained from the principal.Inside the crystal ball, it was an intact origin energy.\u201cWith this origin energy, I can accelerate Blue Star and let the planet continue to evolve rapidly,\u201d Jiang Fan thought to himself.He put down the crystal ball.Jiang Fan turned on his second-hand communicator.This kind of communicator was a product of the immortal cultivation civilization. Inside, there was an ultra-micro teleportation array.The information could be teleported directly.He opened it.The screen was instantly filled with all kinds of news. Without a doubt there was news of Jiang Fan breaking the records of River City. It was already known by the various forces.Many forces sent out congratulations, and\u2026 cooperation request!Jiang Fan browsed through a few pages.Most of them belonged to some capital or planet management companies.There were also some local families.He was careless.They would provide resources to help Jiang Fan build a planet.Of course, this was not free.Naturally, those forces would occupy the shares of the planet in exchange of good reputation\u2014win-win cooperation!Ordinary civilians like Jiang Fan were the favorite of all major capitalists.In reality, if Jiang Fan did not have the deduction system, he had no choice but to accept the goodwill of these forces.From the crowd of capital, he would choose one.After all, the creation of the planet needed a lot of resources and funds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Cambrian! The explosion of life!If the family did not have tens of millions of funds, they couldn\u2019t even think of becoming a level 1 planet lord.Unlike Jiang Fan, others who created planets needed at least a professional planet management team.They were responsible for the maintenance of the planet\u2019s ecosystem and the future deduction.If one of them did not pay attention.The ecology of the planet was very likely to collapse.Not to mention to create an Extraordinary civilization needed all sorts of expensive resources.These required a large amount of money.Fortunately, Jiang Fan had a deduction system.There was no need for a management team. Blue Star was also a natural ecosystem. There was no need for Jiang Fan to take care of it.All he needed to do was follow the order and evolve normally.Jiang Fan still saw it. There were a few different messages. They wanted Jiang Fan to endorse their company\u2019s products. The endorsement fee was also quite high.But very quickly\u2026 the other party sent a new message. They canceled the endorsement deal.The reason\u2026 Jiang Fan did not need to think to know.They probably understood the fact that the initial energy he converted was just ordinary energy.\u201cCapitalism is real.\u201d Jiang Fan sighed.Ordinary energy planet. People wouldn\u2019t even bother to look.In this world, there were naturally planets made of ordinary energy, but none of them got up.In the end, the ecosystem collapsed and they turned into a dead star.Or they would be crushed into pieces by all sorts of supernatural planets.A normal person to fight against magicians, practitioners, and other Extraordinaires, wasn\u2019t that funny?However, Jiang Fan wanted to prove it ordinary planets could still develop a powerful civilization!!\u2014After cooking himself a simple but nutritious meal, Jiang Fan did not rest.Instead, he continued the evolution of the planet without stopping.He entered the awakening space.A blue planet was slowly moving.Jiang Fan observed a few times.After confirming that there were no abnormalities, he began to use his origin energy.A new round of acceleration, but this time, Jiang Fan did not plan to use a ratio of 1 to 1 trillion.The faster he accelerated, the more origin energy consumed. This was all the origin energy Jiang Fan currently had.He had to save some.After setting a new acceleration rate, Jiang Fan was calm and collected.He looked like a spectator observing the evolution of this planet.On Blue Star, time passed quickly.The ecology of the entire planet was also undergoing drastic changes.The blue algae played a crucial role. This was the first oxygen-producing creature on the planet.The cyanobacteria used solar energy to synthesize water and carbon dioxide into organic nutrients, and at the same time released oxygen as exhaust gas.Oxygen was produced by the blue algae. The lack of oxygen on the planet had completely changed.For the birth of a higher life form, it provided a good environment.The era of monocytes had passed. The multicellular life began to develop.According to the history of Earth in his previous life, this place should be the end of the primordial universe.It was about to start the tide of modern life. Earth from his previous life was 4.6 billion years old.It could be divided into four universes\u2014Ancient, Archaean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic!Ancient: 3.8 billion years ago, it was a desolate place without any life.Archaean universe: 2.5 billion years ago, a single-celled life was born.Proterozoic universe: 600 million years ago, multi-celled life was born.Phanerozoic: 6 million years ago, advanced plants and animals began to appear.Creatures gradually evolved into more advanced animals. Animals already had a shell and a clear skeleton structure, so they were called the Phanerozoic.This was the division of Earth.On Blue Star, Jiang Fan was too lazy to think about other names.The four names were the same to divide the history of Blue Star.At this moment, it happened to be at the end of the primordial era.It was about to open the tide of advanced life.The beginning of the universe\u2014Cambrian!The first life force burst forth.Because the lower life forms could not adapt to the new planet environment, a new higher life form appeared.For example, arthropods, brachiopods, vermicular animals, sponges, chordates, and other animals that were basically the same as modern animals.It was represented by the \u201ctrilobite\u201d. It laid the foundation for the evolution of life in the Phanerozoic.Compared to when the planet had just awakened, there was a huge increase in life points.Even though it had not evolved to the level of modern life, the number of species sufficed.At the same time, the size of the planet was also\u2026 kept increasing!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Win by Quantity! Madly rising planet area!In Jiang Fan\u2019s mind, the planet\u2019s data has changed dramatically \u2013\u2014\u3010Planet Name: Blue StarPlanet Level: Level 1Planet diameter: 50.4 kmPlanet species: 312Deduction route: None\u3011\u2014\u201c312 Species?\u201d Jiang Fan slightly raised his eyebrows.If one counted the total number of species since the birth of life on the planet, it\u2019s not just that. It could be a thousand!But\u2026With the emergence of new species.Some low-level species did not adapt to the new environment or were invaded and occupied.They gradually died out.The life force counted the species of life on a real planet. These extinct species would not be counted.Although many species were extinct, there were more new species!And better health provide more life force.\u201cEvolution continues.\u201d After a brief thought, Jiang Fan continued to accelerate the awakening space.He observed all this in silence.From the birth of the planet to now, Jiang Fan hadn\u2019t intervened yet.But for easier observation, Jiang Fan still divided a few eras for Blue Star.The most important are four-Ancient, Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic!Ancient: the first 300 million years, no life.Archean:300 to 400 million years, the birth of single-celled life.Proterozoic:400 to 500 million years ago, multicellular life was born.Phanerozoic:500 million years ago, advanced animals and plants began to emerge, the embryonic form of modern life.Apparently, Phanerozoic is the key. Jiang Fan was in the Phanerozoic.A few more periods were subdivided. He didn\u2019t follor Earth.The division was so detailed. Only a few major periods were planned.After all, in his past life, the diameter of the Earth exceeded 10000 kilometers!Blue Star was only 50 kilometers. It was far from it.There are not so many species that have developed.The first period of division, Jiang Fan named\u2014Cambrian!The planet is in the middle of it\u2019s Cambrian explosion.Low-grade fishes, paleo-amphibians and paleo-animals appeared successively.Insects and amphibians thrived.Paleophytes were dominated by marine algae during this period.The original plants began to land.Pteridophytes also developed and flourished to the extreme, forming dense forests, an important coal-forming period.In the sea, the earliest vertebrates began to emerge\u2014jawless fish!The level of life was rising further.At the same time, crustal movements within the planet were also taking place quietly.The surface of the planet was no longer entirely covered by the ocean.Many large fold mountains appear.High mountains.Hills.Mountains.And so on.Blue Star\u2019s terrain began to become colorful.Fortunately, it\u2019s different from the previous earth because Blue Star was much smaller. Plus Jiang Fan used the deduction system.So\u2026 there\u2019s no extinction here!Over time, the Cambrian also came to an end. At the same time, more new species are born!Jiang Fan was not stingy with the acceleration using origin energy.A new period arrived.This is\u2026 Jurassic!Jiang Fan was still too lazy to name, directly adopting the name of the last Earth.They were the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous.Finally, Jiang Fan adopted the name \u201cJurassic\u201d, the most famous period.This was also the most important period for Blue Star so far!\u2014Author\u2019s Notes\u2014Ps: about the evolution of the planet.The author won\u2019t write too long, but it cannot be skipped. Only a few important periods will be picked up.If you\u2019re interested in them, you can look them up. The history of the Earth is interesting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Jurassic! The Age of Dinosaurs?The Cambrian period ended.At the beginning of the Jurassic period, the species on the planet had reached an unprecedented height.Whether it was quantity or health level, it was far more than before.The life force bonus was also very objective.The most eye-catching thing was the rapid increase in the diameter of the planet.On the planet panel, there was a corresponding change.\u2014\u3010Planet Name: Blue StarPlanet Level: Level 1Planet diameter: 83.6 kmPlanet species: 502Deduction route: None\u3011\u2014And the arrival of the Jurassic era accelerated the growth.Jiang Fan was also looking forward to it.In Earth from his previous life, Jurassic was probably the most famous era.The main reason was naturally because of a household name large animal\u2014Dinosaur!This kind of inconceivable creature was used by countless film and television animation works.\u201cI wonder if a dinosaur will be born on Blue Star?\u201d Jiang Fan could not help but have such an idea.It was just that he also knew Blue Star\u2019s condition was completely incomparable to Earth\u2019s.The area was still too small. There was no room for dinosaurs to grow. It was very difficult to produce large creatures like dinosaurs.The truth was as Jiang Fan expected. After the Jurassic period began, the entire planet became warm and dry.A primitive mammal appeared. The first vertebrates that could fly also appeared at this time.The earliest turtle in the world, the original jaw turtle, was born. The earliest snakes, moths, bees, and many new small mammals appeared.Then, birds began to appear. Mammals developed slowly. The flowering plants also appeared for the first time.It also represented the highest and largest group in the plant world\u2014quilt plant!They stepped onto the stage of evolution. For example, Mulan, Liu, Feng, Poplar, Palm, and so on.The quilt plants rapidly flourished, covering the surface.The emergence and development of angiosperm provided a large amount of food for certain animals, such as insects, birds, and mammals.In terms of animals, horses, antelopes, bison, and other common species were born.In the structure of the planet, the land and sea gradually became distinct.The grassland.High mountain.Forest.Hill.Basin.The desert.\u2014One by one, the crustal movement was stabilizing. The climate was more suitable for the survival of life.It was probably called \u201cLife Explosion\u201d. Then, Jurassic period.It was the \u201cBig Bang\u201d of life.The number and quality of the species that appeared were far from something that Cambrian could compare to.What made Jiang Fan feel a little regretful was that the dinosaur that he had been thinking about for a long time never appeared.There were a lot of species that were different from Earth in his previous life. After all, they were two different planets.Evolution direction naturally could not be the same.Time approached the late Jurassic. Although this period was not long, it was the most colorful.All sorts of new species appeared, bringing the planet an extremely shocking life force!But from visual observation, the diameter of the planet had already exceeded 100 kilometers, and it was growing even more.\u201cThere are more than a thousand species on this planet.\u201d Jiang Fan observed while estimating.If he took it out, it would probably scare a large group of people to death.One had to know, even a level 4 planet was almost impossible to have so many species.Not to mention that this was a planet that had just awakened not long ago.Having a dozen of them was already pretty good.He only felt a little regret that he could not see the dinosaur, then Jiang Fan looked.The next stage. The third generation of the universe. After the Cambrian and Jurassic Period, there\u2019s another era.It was also the most critical and important period until the birth of the planet\u2014Humans!The intelligent life began to appear!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Human\u2026 Birth! The beginning of civilization!Cambrian, Jurassic, and Anthropocene.Each of them was divided into representative creatures.Cambrian. Low-level primitive animals and plants appeared.Jurassic period. Advanced modern plants and animals appeared.The Human Era. An intelligent life form appeared.The current diameter of the planet reached over a hundred kilometers. Plus the warm and humid climate and a unique environment gave more life and more advanced species a chance to be born.As the ancestor of humans, the ancient ape appeared!At the beginning of the Human Era, the first batch of ancient apes\u2014the prairie ape\u2014was born.After that, he other apes appeared in chronological order.Ancient apes were born one after another in a direction closer to humanity.After the Ancient Ape, a humanoid ape appeared.The biggest difference between Ancient Ape and Humanoid Ape was that Ancient Ape was unable to use tools and the humanoid ape could!The development of the humanoid ape, according to the order, was divided into four stages: early apeman, late apeman, early homo sapiens, and late homo sapiens.The ending stage of the late Homo sapiens, modern humans began to form.In a forest, the first true human was born!As time passed, more and more humans appeared.For better survival, they fought against the surrounding beasts.The humans formed small groups. and the appearance of intelligent beings like humans brought a lot of life force.It was also to increase the size of Blue Star once again.\u201cSure enough, the life force of intelligent life is completely incomparable to other species.\u201d Jiang Fan watched the planet grow bigger. He smiled.The planet had evolved to this point. It could be considered as true voyage!One had to know that other people\u2019s Extraordinary planet, an intelligent life had been born from the start and it was Extraordinary.\u201cCurrently, the entire planet\u2026 The number of humans is around a few hundred.\u201d Jiang Fan was checking the human situation in every region.Thanks to the excellent environment of the planet, the newly born humans were not without food.The main threat was a powerful beast outside!But by grouping together, the humans made stone tools and other tools. They began to hunt huge beasts. They gradually became the ruler of this planet!As time passed, humans began to walk out of the lush forest. They chased away the beasts and occupied the fertile plains.Building a house, gathering plants that could be eaten, taming beasts, and building civilization step by step.The original text and language also appeared.The number of humans gradually increased.Gradually, friction and conflict began to arise between the various small groups.Someone died in battle. The winning group absorbed the losing group. They became stronger.After a cruel battle, two large groups were formed from dozens of smaller ones.The two most primitive tribes were born.One was called \u201cDesolate\u201d.One was called \u201cBarbarian\u201d.Both the Desolate Tribe and the Barbarian Tribe had a population of over a hundred people.No one could swallow the other in one go.Small friction continued, but there was no major conflict.After decades of development and in the tenth generation, the barbarian tribe welcomed a powerful leader.The leader\u2019s names in the two tribes during the next generations were consistent.They were called \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cDesolate\u201d.The leader of this generation, Man, was a tall and strong warrior.The Barbarian Tribe had always advocated force. They worshipped the powerful beasts in the wild. The leader kept challenging the warriors in the tribe.One by one, they increased the cohesion of the Barbarian Tribe to an unprecedented level!The other fell behind.The leader began to fight against the Desolate Tribe. The Desolate Tribe could not resist. There were more wins than losses for the Barbarian Tribe.As for the leader of the Desolate tribe, \u201cDesolate\u201d, it was quite different from Man.He had an average physique. There was an aura of weakness in his body.Compared to being brave and fierce, Desolate preferred to study the use of words and tools.He often thought alone until late at night.\u201cInteresting guy.\u201d For the first time, Jiang Fan focused on a person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Jiang Fan\u2019s Intervention! The enlightenment of Desolate Heaven King!Jiang Fan wanted to develop a technological civilization. The most important thing was naturally talent.Technological talent. Talents that could help with scientific research.He looked like the leader of the Barbarians. Although his physique was strong and he was very attractive, for Jiang Fan, he was useless.Chief Desolate, Jiang Fan saw the corresponding characteristics of this aspect.The main problem now was that Desolate faced a threat from the Barbarian Tribe!\u201cSystem, help me deduce. If I help leader Desolate, how much will it affect the development of the Blue Star ecosystem?\u201d Jiang Fan asked.Soon, the deduction was completed.The results of the deduction:If you are to help Desolate, it would lead to irreversible consequences. The probability of ecological disorder is 30%. If you helped secretly, the probability would be less than 1%.\u2014These two routes, there was almost no need for Jiang Fan to think about it.\u201cLooks like I have to help secretly.\u201d Jiang Fan immediately made his decision.As the creator and controller of the planet, Jiang Fan\u2019s secret help was also very easy.He directly controlled the soil. He wrote in front of the leader Desolate.It was naturally written here. To be precise was not even words. It was just some symbols.At this moment, the leader was staying under the tree he usually stayed under, worried about the future of the tribe.\u201cDo you know the biggest difference between humans and beasts?\u201dA line of text appeared at the feet of Desolate.\u201cThe biggest difference?\u201d Desolate was stunned.He was just about to think, when he suddenly realized something. He was shocked. He jumped three meters away.\u201cYou\u2026 What are you?\u201d Desolate was shocked.\u201cI\u2019m from the sky,\u201d Jiang Fan replied.\u201cSomeone from the sky?\u201d Desolate looked at the words on the ground and gradually calmed down.As a member of a primitive tribe, he had a blind faith in the world.Looking at this miraculous method, he was soon convinced.\u201cAnswer my question.\u201d Jiang Fan continued to control the soil, writing.Desolate immediately fell into deep thought.He thought for a long time. However, he did not have a clue. His expression could not help but be a little depressed.\u201cIt\u2019s wisdom,\u201d Jiang Fan answered for him.\u201cWisdom?\u201d Seeing this, Desolate\u2019s entire body shook.It was as if he had comprehended something.\u201cIn terms of individuals, humans are far inferior to beasts, but\u2026\u201d Jiang Fan typed, \u201cWith intelligence, you can use tools and work together.\u201cThat\u2019s why humans can defeat beasts.\u201cBecome the master of this land.\u201cIf you don\u2019t use wisdom.\u201cHow can a weak human fight those ferocious beasts?\u201dHe wrote. With that, Jiang Fan ended this exchange.He left behind Desolate in deep thought.This was also a test.If Desolate could not rely on his own wisdom and not let the tribe escape the crisis, then\u2026 Jiang Fan would give up.Jiang Fan was not disappointed.After pondering for a long time, Desolate had obviously come up with a solution.He began to use his own wisdom.He took the initiative to invite the leader Man to the junction of the two tribes for a friendly exchange.A perfunctory flattery.The leader was full of joy. A few jars of bad wine fell to their stomachs. Desolate took the initiative to propose to Barbarian as a sworn brother.They worked together to deal with the ferocious beasts outside. The atmosphere was brutal. Naturally, he did not refuse.After paying the price of friendship and resources, this alliance was successful.The Desolate Tribe was temporarily freed from the crisis of war.A few years later, Desolate continued to lower himself. He recognized Barbarian as his big brother. Every year, a large amount of food, livestock and\u2026 a woman.The Barbarian Tribe no longer had the idea of attacking the Desolate Tribe.At the same time, Jiang Fan\u2019s secret instruction to Desolate also began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: First Nation! The title of god of Jiang Fan!Jiang Fan taught Desolate a lot of basic knowledge. These were familiar common sense. But in this primitive tribe, it\u2019s unheard of!Bear the humiliation. This iwas the first lesson Jiang Fan taught Desolate.Expand the population and train the army. This was the second lesson.\u201cArmy? What is this?\u201d asked Desolate in confusion.\u201cHow did your tribe defeat that giant saber-toothed tiger the other day, teamwork\u2026 Army!!\u201d Jiang Fan answered briefly.Desolate nodded thoughtfully.Jiang Fan\u2019s teaching was hard to learn. Always listening and rarely asking questions, then only think carefully after class.\u2014Time was like water, time was like a shuttle. Time passed day by day.In a blink of an eye, twenty years passed since the two tribes allied.From a green youth, Desolate grew up to a mature middle-aged man.After years of teaching, Jiang Fan stopped, leaving Desolate alone in practice.\u201cBrave men, we bear the humiliation of twenty years, the time has come for revenge.\u201dThe central square of the Desolate Tribe, Desolate stood on the high platform. He gathered all the warriors of the tribe, getting ready to attack the Barbarian tribe!The past two decades, the Desolate Tribe always submitted to the Barbarian Tribe.The tribute was average, paid a lot of supplies and women.Twenty years of peace. And in these 20 years, Desolate has been guided by Jiang Fan.Agriculture was encouraged. Cultivate wild wheat, rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and other plants into crops.Domesticate wild boars, wild horses, bison, and wolves.Develop more advanced agricultural tools.Secretly train soldiers and make weapons!Improve text and language.After twenty years of development, the population of the tribe already surpassed the barbarians.Other aspects were also surpassed.The day of revenge arrived.\u201cDesolate! Desolate! Desolate!\u201d The soldiers below were shouting his name.Twenty years of rule let Desolate\u2019s prestige be higher than ever.\u2014The war between the two tribes broke out again.This time, the situation turned upside down.Although the number of soldiers on both sides was equal, about 2,000 people, the Desolate Tribe was a real army.The barbarians still followed the traditional hunting team model.They weren\u2019t a match at all.Even the leader and the number one warrior was already potbellied after he spent twenty years drinking.His body had long been hollowed out by wine, leaving not much muscle.There was no suspense about the ending.The Desolate Tribe defeated the Barbarian Tribe without bloodshed. The leader was tied up in front of Desolate. There was no soft heart.He\u2019s being executed, and the latter absorbed the rest of the barbarians.At this point above the planet, there was only one tribe left.Unification was completed.The throne was honored by everyone.A small country named 'summer\u201d was born.People started building cities.After completion, Desolate personally named it \u201cGreat Wild City\u201d.Naturally, these were all achieved under the influence of Jiang Fan.But years of hard work add to that the poor medical conditions of the time dried up the oil in Desolate\u2019s lamp.With his remaining time, Desolate continued to devote to the improvement of productivity and various systems.Before death, Desolate kept shouting the word \u201cFather\u201d.Father!This was Desolate\u2019s name for Jiang Fan. Jiang Fan appeared, manipulating the air.In front of the sickbed, there was a ripple of shock!\u201cFather!\u201d Wild joy and tears.Desolate suddenly sat up.Tears flowed!\u201cFather, I have done what you have taught me,\u201d said Desolate excitedly.\u201cI saw it. You did a good job.\u201d Jiang Fan replied.There was a wild smile.\u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d asked Jiang Fan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Successor! Jiang Fan\u2019s choice!\u201cI don\u2019t have any wish, the only thing I care about\u2026\u201d Desolate looked outside and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the future of this country. There are so many outstanding children, I don\u2019t know who to choose as heir?\u201dOutside the house were Desolate\u2019s wife and children.The tribe encouraged fertility. Desolate led by example. He married more than ten wives.The remaining children, excluding those who died, reached dozens.Among them, many had good character and wisdom.This made it difficult for Desolate to choose.\u201cFather God!\u201cPlease help me, help Xia Kingdom!\u201d Desolate endured the pain. He kowtowed towards the air.Jiang Fan\u2019s gaze turned to the children outside the house. Desolate\u2019s children.There were a total of 43. Eighteen daughters went out. Twenty-five sons remained.Besides the five who were too young, there were still 20 candidates left.As Desolate said, all of them had their own abilities, and none of them were incompetent!This was also\u2026the result of cultivating Desolate.One by one, Jiang Fan scanned the 20 sons.At the same time, he activated the deduction system in his mind.\u201cSystem, help me deduce, who is the most suitable to be the next Emperor of Xia Kingdom?\u201dA moment later.The results of the deduction came out.Line of deduction: Best successor to the next Emperor of Xia KingdomThe results of the deduction:Reason: generosity and benevolent Resilient: powerful and high prestige.\u2014Seeing these two results, Jiang Fan frowned.He was not very satisfied.Suddenly, Jiang Fan thought of something.He immediately changed the way he said, \u201cChange the deduction. Who is the most suitable candidate to inherit the throne, and who is the most beneficial to the development of Blue Star\u2019s technology?\u201dThe result was also very soon.Line of deduction: the most advantageous candidate for both Blue Star Technology and Xia Country governanceThe results of the deduction:Reason. benevolent and kind Resilient. Extremely intelligent and had a desire to explore everything beyond ordinary people.\u2014The result was obvious.The System was explicit.Jiang Fan looked at Qi in the courtyard.Sure enough\u2026 he looked different from others.The others were more or less sad. As for Qi, his expression was calm.Standing in a corner, looking at the sky, no one knew what he was thinking.\u201cQi.\u201d Jiang Fan also made a decision.In front of the wasteland, the word was formed from the dust of the air.\u201cQi?\u201dSeeing this name, Desolate was surprised.Qi was ranked 18th.He was quite outstanding. But the only problem was\u2026 Qi was too young.He was only eight years old. But as for Father\u2019s instructions, Desolate had no questions.He immediately called the people outside and announced the name of the successor.When the shocked crowd dispersed, Desolate left a stunned look on his face.Qi looked rather weak. He was not impressive. But there was a pair of bright eyes.\u201cQi\u2019er, I\u2019ll teach you from now on. Follow me to God Father.\u201d Desolate pulled Qi down with a puzzled expression.\u201cFather?\u201d Kai looked around.He was confused.Under Qi\u2019s puzzled gaze, the air vibrated.A line of text appeared\u2014\u201cDesolate, don\u2019t worry, I will help you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Father.\u201d Desolate was excited.He pulled Qi and bowed several times.After bowing, Qi said, \u201cFather, that was?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s our God Father.\u201d Desolate pointed to the sky.His face was filled with respect and piety.\u201cFather? Heaven?\u201d He seemed to understand but not completely understanding.\u2014Desolate\u2019s only concern was gone.It was the end of the wasteland.The expression on his face passed away peacefully!He was the first king of Xia Kingdom. The evaluation of later generations of him was extremely high.Even\u2026 calling him \u201cDesolate Heaven King \u201c!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Scientific Research Genius!The Xia Kingdom!Desolate\u2019s era ended, and the era of Qi had just begun.Everyone\u2019s desire for power wasn\u2019t that hot. In addition, Desolate\u2019s prestige was extremely high. Therefore\u2026Even though Qi was only eight years old, Desolate\u2019s last order was still carried out well.He ascended to the throne. Because he was too young, all sorts of matters were mainly handled by the elders.Qi did not have much ambition. He spent most of his time following Jiang Fan\u2019s instructions.It had to be said that Qi\u2019s talent greatly surpassed Desolate.A lot of knowledge. As soon as he was taught, he was able to draw inferences about other things.After a year of careful teaching, Jiang Fan could basically tell Qi\u2019s IQ was very high.If it was in his previous life, he could probably become a scientist.Jiang Fan was surprised to find out that Qi could actually tell that this planet was growing bigger and bigger.He was like a piece of unpolished jade. The more he taught, the more pleasantly surprised he discovered.Compared to Desolate who had only taught for a few years, Jiang Fan taught Qi for ten years.Until Qi came of age, it was time to take charge.In these ten years, the changes in Xia Kingdom were huge.Under Qi\u2019s indirect push, from the era of the tribe to the feudal era.Words and language had developed to the point of being simple and useful.The system became more formal. It was the same as in his previous life.The government system here was also divided into the Cabinet and the Six Departments.The population grew rapidly. This was the first time he had broken through a hundred thousand people!The cities were built one after another. The Great Wilderness City was the largest.It also became the capital of the Xia Kingdom.But in a peaceful place, many people had long held high positions, so they could not let go of their power.Once they were in charge of the government, many people would lose their previous power.The atmosphere in the Great Wilderness City became increasingly tense during the first few days of the administration.The rain was coming.On the street, there were not many people. They were mostly soldiers.Within the Xia Kingdom, other than the announcement of the main government, there were two main factions.One of them was known as \u201cthe number one warrior of the Xia Kingdom\u201d, Desolate\u2019s eighth son, Tough!Until today, this kind of worship of martial arts was still very popular in the Xia Kingdom.Tough was brave. In addition, he led the army to fight wild beasts all year round. Among the soldiers and citizens, his prestige was very high.The other side was Desolate\u2019s eldest son, Benevolence. In addition, he was the eldest son.He had always been the successor with the highest voice.If Jiang Fan hadn\u2019t intervened, perhaps he would inherit the throne.Originally, these two tried their best to assist Qi.They were ready to wait for the government to come, then they would retreat.But\u2026Ten years of power. Toughening and reluctant to part with such a high position, a subtle change arose.Plus a group of supporters pushed them to fight even if they didn\u2019t want to.It wasn\u2019t that Qi had supporters. He was the rightful heir to the throne. Desolate\u2019s prestige was still very high in the hearts of the Xia people.Many old officials naturally wouldn\u2019t do anything against his will.But most people knew that among these three people, Qi\u2019s strength was the weakest.Other than that orthodox name, nothing could compete with the other two.In the tense atmosphere, the day of governance had arrived.Naturally, Tough\u2019s large number of soldiers would not wait for him to ascend to the throne and take the lead in making trouble.He led his loyal subordinates, surrounding the palace.After hearing the news, he hurried over.A large group of people followed behind. The two sides were squeezed into the narrow palace, confronting each other.Just then, there was a sudden change.Suddenly, arrows rained down. However, it was actually a rocket. The rocket did not fire at the people inside. It targeted a ditch in the palace, and the ditch was completely filled with black liquid-like substance!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: The Power of Technology! New inventions!After receiving Jiang Fan\u2019s instruction in the past ten years, it was impossible that he was not prepared at all.Among the six, he secretly controlled the department that was the least valued. He gathered all the talents, vigorously developing technology.Other than that, the personal guards left behind by Huang was also firmly controlled by Qi.Blue Star did not have any iron ore, so up until now, he could only create wooden arrows. The lethality was greatly reduced, but there were oil mines!Inside the palace, the black liquid buried in the ditch was naturally oil.If it touched fire, it would burn at once. This was a strategy that Qi had developed a few years ago.The personal guards had good training and equipment. However, they weren\u2019t a match for the tenacious army.The design and construction of the palace were the responsibility of the construction department.If he wanted to do something inside, naturally, it was easy. The palace was designed so narrowly. Naturally, he did that on purpose.The surrounding walls were very high. The palace door closed. It was hard to escape.The rockets kept falling. Instantly, the black oil in the ditch was ignited.The fire burned fiercely. Thick black smoke rolled up. It enveloped the entire palace.The tenacious army was stunned. No one had ever seen such a miraculous and shocking scene.The two sides added up to tens of thousands of people.Facing the thick smoke, they were all useless.Seeing the situation was bad, both of them immediately led the people out of the palace.But the only entrance to the palace was already surrounded by Qi and his guards.The rockets kept firing. Even Tough and his brave soldiers could not break through the lines of the guards.The fire grew bigger and bigger. The smoke grew darker and darker. People were constantly engulfed by the fire. Or if they inhaled too much smoke, they died on the spot.The palace was full of miserable screams.Tens of thousands of people, like harvested rice, fell one by one.Three hours later, the battle had basically ended.Tough was brave, but he was outnumbered. He received more than ten arrows and more than ten wounds, then died.From the tens of thousands of soldiers, more than half were dead or injured.The remaining few dropped their weapons and surrendered. They did not join the battle.Benevolent\u2019s hiding place was kicked open, and he was captured by the guards.He knelt in front of Kai.\u201cA merciful person can not be an emperor,\u201d Qi recalled Jiang Fan\u2019s words.Although he could not bear it, he still raised the stone spear and inserted it into his left chest.Just like that, the internal chaos that was about to happen was easily resolved.Qi officially sat on the throne. He began to govern personally.During the next ten years, the position of the Ministry of Industry had risen.Craftsmen became the most respected profession.Outside, they were usually called \u201cmasters\u201d.Qi also opened a College of Making Things, cultivating a large number of craftsmen.Among the craftsmen, Qi was the best.He created the new \u201cFour Great Inventions\u201d.Papermaking, printing, compass, and kerosene.It was all done by Qi.Of course, Jiang Fan helped him. He passed on the relevant knowledge.Under Jiang Fan\u2019s interference, the progress of Blue Star\u2019s civilization.It was much faster than Earth in his previous life.In just a few hundred years, from the tribal era to the feudal era and the development of technology were all achieved.Even in other domains, for example, art, literature, philosophy, and so on developed very quickly.At this moment, Jiang Fan had no choice but to stop the acceleration of the planet because the origin energy was about to run out again.Jiang Fan walked out the door and towards the Planet Association.He was going to find a way to make money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Hostless Planet! The source of origin energy!Planet Association was located in the center of River City.It was a ninety-nine-story skyscraper. The entire building was owned by the Planet Association.People came and went to the hall on the first floor. It was very lively.Jiang Fan came to a window and waited in line to check the latest requests from the Planet Association.If he wanted to obtain origin energy, there were two methods. One was to spend money to buy it. The other was to plunder.The target of the plunder was the ownerless planet.So-called ownerless planet\u2026 This was the planet where the planet lord died.After all, everyone\u2019s lifespan was limited. Or it could be an accidental death.Once the planet master died, the planet that was left behind became ownerless.This way, they could then construct a passage to invade this planet and plunder the origin energy.This was also most of the main source of origin energy of the market.Soon, it was Jiang Fan\u2019s turn.\u201cHello, what do you need?\u201d the young staff member smiled and asked.\u201cI want to ask. If I want to go to a hostless planet, what do I need?\u201d Jiang Fan asked.\u201cTo the ownerless planet, if it\u2019s a level 1 planet, the procedures are very simple. As long as you pay a toll of 10,000, you can enter,\u201d the young staff member said.\u201c10000?\u201d Jiang Fan raised his eyebrows.All these years, Jiang Fan was frugal. He often did odd jobs and tutoring. He had saved ten thousand.It was just that if he paid the toll, it would all be gone.\u201cNo input, no output.\u201d Without any hesitation, Jiang Fan handed his ID card and said, \u201cHelp me handle it.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The young staff took the ID card and said, \u201cPlease select a planet first\u2026\u201dAt this point, the young staff stopped.He glanced at Jiang Fan and asked, \u201cIs this your first time on a planet without a master?\u201d\u201cYes, is there a problem?\u201d Jiang Fan replied.\u201cIt\u2019s like this. According to the latest rules of the Planet Association, if you\u2019re going for the first time, you can waive the toll,\u201d the young staff member explained.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad to have such a rule.\u201d Jiang Fan smiled.He just saved ten thousand!This was the first time, so Jiang Fan was also more cautious.As recommended by the young staff, he chose a hostless planet of the warrior civilization.Normally speaking, as there was no one to take care of hostless planets, the ecosystem would gradually collapse.The energy on the planet would gradually decrease, and the entire planet would gradually lose its life force.In the end\u2026 it turned into a dead star!Of course, there were exceptions.However, such an exception was only one of the few.\u201cA warrior planet on the verge of collapse? I need to make some preparations.\u201d Jiang Fan was not careless.After all, the martial arts civilization was also an extraordinary civilization.One mistake, perhaps the ship would be overturned in the gutter.\u2014He returned to his residence.Jiang Fan immediately entered the awakening space.He found Qi who was resting.\u201cFather, you\u2019re here.\u201d Qi was very happy.Ever since he was in power, it had been several years since he had been able to contact Jiang Fan.Compared to the tedious state affairs, Qi hoped to learn novel knowledge from Jiang Fan.\u201cDidn\u2019t you always ask what was outside the planet?\u201d Jiang Fan used the water vapor to display the text on the table.Qi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cFather, this is\u2026\u201dWIl he tell me the truth about this planet?Qi was very smart.Not only did he realize that the planet was growing larger when he was young. He also guessed that there was another world outside the planet.\u201cNow\u2026 The opportunity is here.\u201d Jiang Fan used words to communicate. \u201cI will open a path to another planet. Through this path, the people here can enter another planet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Planet Passage!Take the initiative to set out!\u201cAnother planet?\u201d Qi was stunned.\u201cBe prepared.\u201d Jiang Fan continued to display the text, \u201cThe passage will open in three months.\u201cWhen the time comes, you will bring your army to that planet.\u201cReminder.\u201cThe natives on that planet are not ordinary people.\u201cThey are extraordinary and stronger than a beast!\u201d\u201cExtraordinary?!\u201d Qi was surprised and delighted.At the same time, there were traces of doubt.\u201cExtraordinary, as the name suggests, is a human with extraordinary strength.\u201cEven the strongest warrior in the Xia Kingdom.\u201cIn the hands of Extraordinaires, he is not a match!\u201cBut\u2026\u201cThe number of opponents is very small.\u201cSo, you can rely on the army to suppress the numbers.\u201cIn short, just like when dealing with wild beasts, you have to be prepared.\u201d Jiang Fan reminded him.Then, he logged off. He left behind a look of shock and joy.For Qi, Jiang Fan said a few short sentences. However, it was more shocking than any other novel knowledge in the past.\u201cThere really is another world outside this planet. There\u2019s actually another planet where people live. It\u2019s really exciting,\u201d he muttered to himself.After the shock and joy, the anticipation grew stronger and stronger.\u201cFather will open the planet\u2019s passageway to plunder the resources of other planets?\u201d Qi had a preliminary guess.\u201cNo matter what, this is Father\u2019s first mission to me. I must do it well.\u201d Qi could not wait to act.One after another, the most elite group of soldiers from the Xia Kingdom had been transferred. He trained them personally.\u2014Soon, three months passed.As for Jiang Fan, who had accelerated time, only one day passed outside.Under the guidance of the staff, Jiang Fan boarded a spaceship.This was a spaceship from the cultivation civilization. There were several formations carved on it. It could fly in the air.On the spaceship, there were many passengers.Most of them were level 1 planet masters like Jiang Fan. Some traveled together. Some of them were acting alone.However, their goals were similar. It was all to plunder the Origin energy from a hostless planet.The hostless planet was in the hostless galaxy.It was also the ship\u2019s destination this time.About an hour passed, the spaceship arrived at a large cave.\u201cThis is the entrance to the galaxy.\u201d A person with a better understanding took the initiative to explain to Jiang Fan and the other newcomers. \u201cThere are many entrances like this, but you can\u2019t tell from their appearance. The main purpose of the toll we pay is to stabilize the entrance.\u201d\u201cEveryone get ready.\u201d The staff member reminded them.Then, the spaceship entered the cave.Jiang Fan felt a slight shake.A moment later, the spaceship passed through the hole.What came into view was a huge galaxy surrounded by planets!Jiang Fan looked at it curiously.A staff member\u2019s voice rang in his ear. \u201cThis is the galaxy. If you want to enter a hostless planet, just activate the channel imprint.\u201dThere was no need for the staff to remind the few veterans.They quickly took out the imprint that was wrapped in crystal. The newcomers were also eager to give it a try.\u201cThe people who came here for the first time should pay attention.\u201d The staff reminded, \u201cAlthough the information about the hostless planets is the latest, there are many planets that haven\u2019t been updated for many years.\u201cNo one knows what\u2019s going on inside.\u201cIf you encounter a special situation, for example, the strength of the planet\u2019s natives exceeds the forecast.\u201cThen let the people of your planet withdraw from the passage and close it to reduce losses!\u201dNot just the staff, there were also warm-hearted old men giving hints to the newcomers.Jiang Fan listened for a while.He took out the channel imprint and began preparing to enter!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Entering the Warrior Planet!One day outside was equivalent to three months in Blue Star.Jiang Fan had deliberately adjusted the flow of time within the awakening space to a certain value.\u2026\u2026Within the Great Desolate City of Xia Kingdom.A military camp had been set up on a small hill not far from the palace.Inside the military camp, a team of brave soldiers was training with great fervor.Qi stood on the high platform and observed the soldiers of the Xia Kingdom.During these three months, Qi was personally responsible for training this group of soldiers.All of them were carefully selected from the whole kingdom and every single one of them was a warrior among warriors.Following Jiang Fan\u2019s advice, Qi was doing his best.He was also looking forward to seeing the outside world.He had named this army, the Great Desolate Army.It was currently the strongest army in the Xia kingdom.\u201cWarriors.\u201dQi glanced at the soldiers below and his sound resounded throughout the square.Everyone immediately stopped and looked up at the stage.\u201cToday is the day of the conquest of the alien planets\u2026\u2026 Are you ready?\u201dQi shouted.\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201dThe square shook with the soldier\u2019s response.After three months of training, all the soldiers knew that there were other planets besides their planet which were inhabited by other beings.\u201cFather God, see? These are the brave men of my Xia Kingdom.\u201dQi looked at the sky and spoke to himself.\u2026\u2026Jiang Fan naturally saw this scene that happened in the Xia Kingdom.Qi really didn\u2019t let him down and specifically established an army to fight the natives of the alien planet.Jiang Fan had been paying attention to the changes in the planet panel in his mind.Blue Star had really developed rapidly.Especially after the number of humans increased, various kinds of data had a significant improvement.\u2026\u2026[Planet name: Blue StarPlanet level: Level 1Diameter of the planet: 250.4 kmPlanet species: 1212Deduction route: none]\u2026\u2026Now there were hundreds of thousands of people in the Xia kingdom.Although the kingdom had broken away from the tribal era, it still maintained the martial spirit.One could even say that all the people of the kingdom were soldiers.More than 100,000 soldiers could be mobilized in the event of an emergency.Although this army only had 10,000 soldiers, all of them were the elite of the elites.They were equipped with the most advanced weapons and leather armor.In addition, Qi led them to train hard day and night, so their combat power was very strong.\u2026\u2026On the spaceship, the veterans entered their rooms one by one and took out the channel imprint to enter their respective target planets.Newcomers followed their example.After checking the situation of Xia Kingdom, Jiang Fan also returned to his room and locked the door.Then he took out the crystal ball and activated the channel imprint.Immediately afterward, a hazy light appeared above the Blue Star in the awakening space.Eventually, this light dispersed and a ten meters large door that was made of light appeared.\u201cIs this\u2026\u2026 The passage between the planets?\u201dJiang Fan stared at the light door. It was releasing a subtle aura.It was an energy that did not belong to this world.In other words, there was another world on the other side of the passage.In the Great Desolate City.There was no need for Jiang Fan to inform Qi because his men had also discovered this door of light and reported it.Qi immediately rushed over with his army.Everyone became shocked upon seeing this huge light door.\u201cWhat kind of technology is this?\u2026\u2026 How can it create such a marvel?\u201dQi\u2019s heart was greatly shaken.He would love to do some research right now, but he knew that at this moment, the most important thing was to lead his army through this gate of light.\u201cWarriors, the time has come to show your courage. Follow me\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s go.\u201dQi waved his hand and took the lead in entering the passage while the Great Desolate Army followed him.A few moments later, the view from the other side of the passage came into his view.At this time, Jiang Fan also saw the situation on this side.According to the Planetary Association\u2019s information, this was a warrior planet that was on the verge of collapse.The truth was not much different.Jiang Fan saw that the entire land, including the sky, was turning yellow and the energy within this planet had thinned out to the extreme.There was hardly any vegetation in sight above the earth, and not much life could be felt.The shrinkage of this planet was very severe.Jiang Fan found that the current planet was roughly estimated to be less than 100 kilometers in diameter.Although the planet was on the verge of collapse, many warriors were still alive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Warriors vs. Army of Ordinary People!The passage opened in a valley on this planet.Qi was very cautious.He didn\u2019t relax because there were 10,000 elite soldiers behind him.Instead, he instructed the army to stay inside the valley and dispatched some scouting teams to go out and check the situation outside.This was not a big planet and beyond the valley, just a few indigenous warriors were wandering around!Jiang Fan also saw these indigenous warriors.There were three of them and the aura of each one was very powerful.Even if the most elite warriors of the Great Desolate Army would form a team no one of them was a match for any of the three!The suppression of this force value.He could clearly feel the suppression of this force value.\u201cOn this planet, there is true Qi Energy, which was also developed to a good height before the owner of the planet died.\u201dJiang Fan recalled the information obtained from the Planetary Association in his mind.\u201cThe planet\u2019s owner has been dead for a long time now.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one who is taking care of this planet.\u201d\u201cThe true Qi Energy on the planet is slowly diminishing.\u201d\u201cAs the true Qi Energy decreases, the strength of the warriors here will also decrease.\u201dIf it was in its prime, there were thousands of warriors on this planet!Let alone 10,000 troops, even if it was 100,000! Jiang Fan would not dare to attack at all.But now there couldn\u2019t be that much here.He could tell just from the size of the planet, that it was impossible to support a large number of warriors.Jiang Fan saw that the clothes on the three warriors were tattered and there was still hunger on their faces!Apparently, there was not enough food here.\u201cThe physical quality of warriors was far beyond that of ordinary people, and they can survive by eating just a little food every day.\u201d\u201cIf the planet continues to decline.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThese warriors will probably end up starving to death.\u201dJiang Fan thought about it.While observing the situation outside the valley, the vigilance of the warrior was so sharp.While the scouting team was coming out of the valley, three pairs of eyes shot sharply at once and spotted the scouting soldiers hiding behind the hill.Seeing these soldiers, the three warriors were not surprised. Instead, there was a hint of joy on their face!Immediately after that, the three warriors said something to each other.A warrior then turned around and quickly ran back at the speed of a warrior.Their speed was much faster than ordinary people\u2019s speed.\u201cNot good, we\u2019ve been spotted.\u201dThe scouting team was alarmed.Qi was also following behind the scouting team.After seeing this scene, his face became a little grave, and he said: \u201cAs expected of an extraordinary person, the strength is much stronger than our ordinary people, you\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t be careless, the first guard at the mouth of the valley, if you encounter something bad, retreat immediately.\u201dQi was a very cautious person so he immediately ordered the scouting team to retreat.On the other hand, he let other soldiers start constructing simple fortifications.Surprisingly, they planned to take a defensive position!\u2026\u2026After about an hour, one figure after another appeared in the distance, it was flying this way and it came closer.Everyone just saw that.There were impressively dozens of warriors and their aura was not weak but each one of them had tattered clothes, even the shoes on their feet were broken.These warriors were seeing the soldiers at the mouth of the valley, one by one\u2026..In their eyes, there was a hungry wolf-like oily green light!There were a few of them.They had been hungry for a long time and were treating scouting soldiers like food.The leader was a bald man with a height of nearly 1.9 meters and he was carrying a large knife nearly two meters long over his shoulder!The bald man was staring at the scout soldiers.At that time he was scanning back and forth up and down.He said unexpectedly while he was licking his lips, \u201cThis time the intruders are actually\u2026\u2026 a group of ordinary people?\u201d\u201cOrdinary people are also creatures, and their meat may be even more tender.\u201dA petite woman next to him laughed and said, \u201cOrdinary people are not better to deal with, if they are warriors like us, maybe we will have to kill a lot more.\u201dA man with a face full of flesh hummed said, \u201cJust these few ordinary people, I\u2019ll kill them like chickens!\u201dA long-haired youth said with great disdain, \u201cA total of fifty-eight warriors!\u201dWhile these warriors were speaking, Jiang Fan was watching from a high position.He was watching it clearly that the Great Desolate Army of ten thousand people were against fifty-eight warriors?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Battle of Wisdom! A present for Jiang Fan!It was obvious that the warriors of this planet had been invaded.Apparently, as for their previous invasions, they managed to fend them off!\u201cSpeaking of which, we haven\u2019t eaten meat for a long time.\u201dThe bald man was carrying a two-meter-long sword and almost drooled.Let alone meat on this planet, even grassroots and barks were all about to be eaten up!\u201cThese dozens of ordinary people are enough to feed us for a long time.\u201dThe petite woman said.As the planet was on the verge of collapse, these warriors did not have any morals.For them, living was the most important thing!These warriors had nothing to worry about confronting the ordinary people.All of them went straight ahead, each one used their means and scrambled to the valley.The scouting team hurriedly released arrows, due to the lack of iron ore on Blue Star.Therefore, the main material of the current arrows was copper, and the power was much worse than that of iron arrows.Boom!Boom!Boom!\u2026\u2026Dozens of arrows shot over but they were easily shot down by warriors such as the bald man!\u201cThat\u2019s it? Ordinary people are really weak.\u201dThe long-haired youth laughed disdainfully.\u201cGo back to the valley and implement the second plan.\u201dSeeing that the arrows didn\u2019t give these warriors much threat, Qi\u2019s face changed slightly and he ordered immediately.The original first plan was head-to-head battles.It was all about taking advantage of numbers and stacking these warriors to death, but now it didn\u2019t work.The scouting team and Qi immediately retreated into the valley.The bald man and other warriors quickly came to the mouth of the valley.There was no stop, they just broke in.After entering, they saw a few hundred people in front of him.The bald man and the others couldn\u2019t help but have their eyes lit up.\u201cHahahaha, there are so many people here\u2026\u2026\u201dThe bald man hadn\u2019t finished speaking yet. Suddenly his voice stuck!Then, his face changed!Only\u2026\u2026Around the valley, a large number of troops poured out from the cracks, mountain roads, and behind the boulders!Visually, there were at least 5,000 people!Although the bald man and the others were strong they were not stupid either.Against a few hundred ordinary people, it was not a problem for them, but that number had multiplied tenfold and it was still an organized army.It wouldn\u2019t be easy to deal with. Even if it could be defeated in the end, there won\u2019t be many of these warriors left!In this narrow valley, the warrior\u2019s advantage was further narrowed.\u201cRetreat.\u201dThe bald man gave a low shout.The decision was made immediately.Others were greedy though and were drooling, but they also knew the importance of the matter.Immediately, they turned around and retreated.Swish!Swish!Swish!\u2026\u2026A large number of arrows shot from the air.Those arrows were coming from all directions, like a rain of arrows.It came overwhelmingly at the entrance to the valley.In just one hour, it had been blocked by Qi\u2019s orders with boulders.Only a narrow passage was left, when these warriors came in, they didn\u2019t even notice this problem.Qi led a team of a thousand people and blocked the passage to stop these people from retreating!Although these people were warriors, they still couldn\u2019t fly.They were surrounded by smooth cliffs and were trying to get out.The only way out was through this passage that held two people!But Qi\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t over yet and a rain of arrows poured out of the sky and it was also mixed with a lot of rockets.Inside the valley, a lot of oil had been buried!Once it was ignited by the rocket it would immediately burn violently and the 10,000 soldiers who were prepared for this were wearing the improvised smoke masks they carried with them!Thousands of soldiers surrounded the area on the outside as the spear formation.Those arrows were not fatal.The crowd of warriors who were surrounded by the north frantically poured out!Clang!Clang!Clang!\u2026\u2026The warriors were all waving their weapons to block the bows and arrows!What they cultivated was true Qi Energy.The physical body was not invincible. Once it was hit by an arrow, it was painful!Suddenly intense smoke hit the area even these warriors couldn\u2019t stand it!\u201cDamn it.\u201dThe bald man shouted and said, \u201cCome with me and kill them!\u201dFifty-eight warriors quickly rushed towards the mouth of the valley.But the thousand elite soldiers that Qi had prepared were already prepared there.At the same time, such a small passage could only accommodate two warriors to go over.It was even worse, inside the passage and it was also ambushed with oil.After the bald man and others entered, a rocket was shot over and the passage started burning crazily!\u201cAh!\u201dThe whole bodies of warriors were set on fire.They couldn\u2019t help but scream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Unexpected Harvest!Even if they were warriors, they were still afraid of fire.After the unfortunate warriors were ignited by fire, they were no longer able to block the arrows coming from all directions.Instantly, countless arrows were hit. Their bodies were densely packed like a hedgehog!After the Great Desolate Army entered this planet, they were the first warriors to be killed!In the narrow passage, the warriors were huddled together, and more and more warriors were caught in the sea of fire!The bald man was very brave. He was holding a two-meter long sword, dashed madly to the outside!Two arrows were hit in his body, but it didn\u2019t affect his speed at all.Immediately, he rushed to the front.\u201cStop him!\u201dQi shouted sharply!The elite soldiers at the mouth of the valley, armed with spears, surrounded the mouth of the valley!The bald man slashed wildly with a sword!Spears were being chopped over and over again!Soldiers fell one by one as they were approached by a warrior.Ordinary soldiers had a hard time resisting but the soldiers of the Great Desolate Army were elites.They were not afraid of death!The front fell and the ones behind continued to rush up and they surrounded the bald man and others.They were not letting them rush out.The good thing was that the passage was really small.There were not many warriors who could cross the sea of fire and rush out.The bald man and the few others frantically charged forward but they were not able to break through the encirclement of the Great Desolate Army.A rain of arrows was all around and it was still falling.The number of arrows hitting their body was increasing and they fell behind.Other warriors who hadn\u2019t had time to enter the passage saw that the situation was not good.They returned directly towards the surrounding army to attack!It might be that they realized that they were going to die here today.All of them were crazy to the core!The battle situation at the mouth of the valley and in the valley was extremely tragic!The strongest was the bald man.He killed and wounded dozens of elite soldiers.However, they were helpless.The difference in numbers between the two sides was too great.Plus, there was no heart.Gradually, more and more warriors fell under fire, smoke, and arrows!There were fewer and fewer warriors left.By the end, the bald man with an unknown number of wounds also fell!Seeing this, Jiang Fan breathed a sigh of relief and his eyes began to turn elsewhere.This was a warrior planet and once there was a high level of warrior civilization!In addition to plundering the power of the origin and other resources were also not a small harvest.As this was a warrior planet, there were many warriors and exercises.There might also be divine weapons and precious heavenly treasures!The resources of this planet were average. There were only some martial arts and exercises!\u2026\u2026After about one hour the battle was over inside and outside the valley.All the warriors were killed by the Great Desolate Army, but the Great Desolate Army also paid a small price.Hundreds of soldiers were killed and seriously injured!There were also many minor injuries, but in the end, it was a win.It was a victory against extraordinary humans.Among the remaining soldiers, most faces were beaming with joy and excitement!Qi was not too emotional and just let people clean the battlefield.On the other hand, he was researching the weapon that a warrior carried with him!The planet\u2019s life force bottomed out in an instant as all the fifty-eight warriors were dead.The planet was moving at a speed visible to the naked eye and it shrank down quickly.The original diameter was close to 100 kilometers but after that, it shrunk to less than 20 kilometers.In addition to the warriors, there were not many high-level creatures left on this planet.Mostly, it was weeds, and some crops, bacteria, microorganisms, etc.Following the usual trend, these creatures would die soon and the life force of this planet would also be completely lost and it would be completely a dead star.The Great Desolate Army returned with a reward.Almost all the resources that could be moved on this planet had been moved back to Blue Star.Jiang Fan\u2019s gaze still lingered.He used the power of the origin and let this ownerless planet undergo acceleration.After less than one year, the planet\u2019s life would be completely extinct.The diameter also returned to the size when it was just awakened.This time, a strange mass of energy was rising from the interior of the planet and it seemed to want to escape from here, but Jiang Fan, who had been waiting for a long time, captured it directly with the crystal!This strange energy was the power of the origin generated by this planet.It was just a pity that the level of civilization on this planet was not high.The amount of origin power generated was not much.It was probably only about half a serving!After capturing the power of the origin, the purpose of Jiang Fan\u2019s trip was also achieved.His eyes retracted and turned back to the Blue Star.As instructed by Jiang Fan, martial arts techniques and other secret books were ordered by Qi to be moved back inside the palace.With Jiang Fan\u2019s authority, he could take these things directly!It\u2019s just that these were not of much use to Blue Star.Therefore, Jiang Fan took them and came to the Planet Association again and was ready to be used for resources or money!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Resource Exchange!Planet Association.In the lobby on the first floor, there was still a busy scene.Jiang Fan came to the same window as last time and the reception staff was also the same as last time.This time, there was no one in line in front of it.Jiang Fan walked straight over, handed over his identity card, and said, \u201cHello, I want to exchange some items.\u201d\u201cHello sir, what items do you need to exchange?\u201dThe young staff member took the ID card and swiped it.Followed by\u2026\u2026She lifted her head and looked at Jiang Fan.For this handsome and young man who came yesterday, the young female staff member was naturally impressed.\u201cI want to exchange some martial arts and exercises methods.\u201dJiang Fan took out the martial arts techniques he had plundered from that previous warrior planet and placed it on the counter.There were thick stacks of piles on that planet and it was also built for decades.Naturally, there were many martial arts techniques left.The young female staff member saw so many techniques and gave Jiang Fan a somewhat surprised look and asked, \u201cMr. Jiang, this is\u2026\u2026 successfully plundered that planet yesterday?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Jiang Fan nodded.There was nothing to hide, one check could tell that.A look of surprise flashed across the young female staff member\u2019s eyes!Yesterday, she recommended this planet.Although it was on the verge of collapse, it was a medium martial world!In this martial civilization, there were also internal divisions.There were low martial civilizations, medium martial civilizations, and high martial civilizations!Among them, the powerful high martial civilization had developed to the extreme.They were even able to compete with medium civilizations.It was also not to be underestimated for the newcomers, most of them would choose the low martial world.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he didn\u2019t have a better choice yesterday, the female staff would not recommend this planet either.But unexpectedly, the young man in front of her resolved it so soon.\u201cCould it be a talented person from any school?\u201dThe young female staff member muttered something in her heart and then began to check.About three minutes later when she checked it out, she looked up at Jiang Fan, revealed a smile, and said, \u201cThere are a total of thirty-one martial arts and exercise methods here, of which\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are eleven books in the unclassified category.\u201d\u201cThere are fifteen books of the yellow grade.\u201d\u201cThere are five Profound Rank books.\u201d\u201cOne of them is a Middle Profound Rank sword technique!\u201dHearing the young staff explain, Jiang Fan nodded slightly.Various planets had different levels of civilization because each had its realm not just in terms of cultivation, this included items, exercise methods, etc. as well.For easier trading of all kinds of planet civilizations, both high-level and low-level civilizations had adopted a uniform level division.From low to high there were four levels: Yellow, Profound, Earth, and Heaven.Among them, each level was also divided into three small levels high, medium, and low!\u201cDo you want to exchange these martial arts for resources or federal dollars?\u201dThe young staff member asked.\u201cChange it to federal dollars.\u201dJiang Fan said.Now, what Jiang Fan wanted the most was iron ore because the Blue Star was still too small as compared to the previous planet. So, a lot fewer species and minerals were born there.One very important iron ore had yet to take shape, but the price of iron ore was naturally not expensive, the lowest estimate was also 10 million.Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t afford it at the moment.According to the theory, items from the outside could not be put directly into the various awakening planets and they must be encapsulated with a crystal ball first!This was true for both living and dead things.These martial arts techniques were not worth the money, a few hundred per book was the most.The yellow and profound grades were a bit more expensive.That Profound grade intermediate level sword technique was valued at $200,000!If it was outside, it was estimated to be able to sell even higher.But for one thing, Jiang Fan didn\u2019t have that access.Secondly, this was also more work, Jiang Fan did not have that time.It sold for over half a million dollars.\u201cGoing to other planets and plundering is the fastest way to get rich.\u201dJiang Fan could not help but sigh.\u2026\u2026After coming back from the Planet Association, Jiang Fan looked into the awakening space to check out the situation of Blue Star.In the Xia Kingdom, within the capital city of Great Desolation, a great celebration was underway!They celebrated the success of this alien expedition!The generals sang, danced, and were drinking, guessing, and laughing!A piece of cheerfulness was in the air.Jiang Fan found out that Qi stood alone on top of the high platform.With eyes in the sky, there was a blank look in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Supersonic Weapons? Qi\u2019s shock!Qi was looking at the laughter of the crowd and celebration of the generals at the bottom and there was not much joy on his face.Instead, there was a trace of worry and\u2026\u2026 daze!\u201cFather.\u201dQi looked up at the sky and muttered to himself, \u201cI have already seen the superhuman you mentioned, and sure enough\u2026 very powerful!\u201d\u201cIn terms of individual force.\u201d\u201cOur Xia Kingdom\u2019s most powerful warriors are far from their opponents!\u201d\u201cAlthough I won today, it also sacrificed the lives of hundreds of soldiers.\u201d\u201cIf there is a day that a more powerful transcendent comes, there will be more, hundreds! Thousands!!\u201d\u201cThen how are we going to deal with it?\u201dQi was very intelligent. In the past, he realized that the Blue Star under his feet was getting bigger.Now, he also noticed that transcendents were very powerful.It did not seem to be something that ordinary people could deal with.Jiang Fan, who just entered the awakening space, just saw this scene and manipulated the water vapor in the air, the text was displayed in front of Qi.\u201cYour father, Desolation, had similar worries as you did back then.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d Qi was thrilled.\u201cYour father\u2019s situation was much worse than you are now.\u201dJiang Fan continued to display the text and said, \u201cYou should have heard about it, the Desolate Tribe had a most difficult period under the oppression of the Barbarian Tribe.\u201d\u201cThe barbarian tribe was so much stronger than the Desolate tribe at that time.\u201d\u201cBut later\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy was it the Desolate Tribe that ultimately won?\u201d\u201cIt was wisdom!\u201dQi\u2019s eyes lit up as he replied, \u201cBack then, Father relied on a wisdom that no one else had thus he defeated the barbarian tribe.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard my father tell this story, but\u2026\u2026\u201dQi still frowned slightly and said, \u201cThe barbarian tribes were after all not ordinary people, but these are extraordinary people.\u201d\u201cThey were born to exist beyond us.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of a day when I will meet more and stronger extraordinary people.\u201d\u201cHow are we going to win?\u201d\u201cJust relying on numbers to suppress it?\u201dIt must be said that the previous battle with the warriors let Qi see the extraordinary style at the same time.There was also a tremor in his heart for such a powerful individual.If it weren\u2019t for the geographical advantage of the valley, even if the opponent was invincible, they must be able to escape!This\u2026\u2026 was hardly something that ordinary human beings could fight against.\u201cThose warriors are indeed very powerful.\u201dJiang Fan gathered water vapor and said, \u201cTheir strength and speed are more frightening than fierce beasts, but\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs the fastest warrior faster than an arrow?\u201d\u201cNo they are not faster than arrows, our bows and arrows are not much of a threat to them either,\u201d Qi replied.The alertness and reaction of the warriors were too strong and a rain of arrows came down.It was also hard to hit a few of them.After a pause, Qi said again: \u201cI know that the current bow and arrow technology has just started, and it does not have enough lethality, but even if it tends to be perfect, it is estimated that it will not be a threat to the powerful Transcendent.\u201d\u201cYou have a solidified mind.\u201dJiang Fan reminded: \u201cDo you think that ordinary people\u2019s weapons cannot pose a threat to extraordinary people?\u201d\u201cThere are weapons that are as fast as sound.\u201d\u201cDo you think the previous warriors could escape?\u201d\u201cSame as the sound?\u201dQi was shocked because the speed of sound was almost instantaneous!Immediately replied: \u201cIf our weapons have the speed of sound, those extraordinary people before will not be able to escape!\u201d\u201cBut a supersonic weapon\u2026\u2026 is that possible?\u201dHe was inspired by questions.\u201cWhy is that not possible?\u201dJiang Fan said word by word: \u201cYou think it\u2019s impossible, that\u2019s because you haven\u2019t seen the essence behind the speed!\u201d\u201cIf there are grades in physics, then\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not even a beginner now!\u201d\u201cNot even a beginner?\u201dSeeing these few words displayed by Jiang Fan, Qi\u2019s eyes suddenly turned red.He grasped with both hands and his body shook slightly.It was a little hard to believe because Qi was not a proud person but he also knew the current technology of the Xia Kingdom.Most of them were from him!In terms of technology, no one was stronger than him in the whole Xia Kingdom.This was his pride!\u201cFather!\u201dWith a trembling voice, he said, \u201cI know my level of knowledge cannot compare with yours, but for the Xia Kingdom, I have given all my heart and soul!\u201d\u201cI invented papermaking, printing, the compass, and oil.\u201d\u201cI also invented the waterwheel, the windmill, and the curved plow, textile carts, carriages, ceramics, bricks, and tiles, these are all my contributions.\u201d\u201cMost of the inventions of the Ministry of Industry are related to me.\u201d\u201cI feel like I should be on my way to quer\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTravel quite a distance.\u201dQi did not dare to directly question Jiang Fan.Instead, he used a large paragraph of words to express his dissatisfaction!\u201cSo what?\u201dJiang Fan continued to display the text.He felt that it was time to teach this smart child a proper lesson!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Jiang Fan\u2019s Six Questions! Kewu Academy was established!\u201cSo what?\u201dJiang Fan\u2019s tone was clearly expressed through the displayed text.\u201cDo you know why water flows lower and not higher?\u201d\u201cDo you know why drinking cold water makes you sick and hot water doesn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cDo you know why sound is faster than a bow and arrow?\u201d\u201cDo you know why coal burns, but the stone doesn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cDo you know why lions and tigers can give birth to offspring, but dogs and cats are not?\u201d\u201cAlso, why are transcendents so much stronger than ordinary people when they are also human?\u201dJiang Fan asked six questions in a row to confuse him!These are seemingly natural and taken-for-granted phenomena.Even if it was someone as smart as Qi, he did not bother to look deeper but now Jiang Fan asked about it.Qi just realized that the skills he mastered in the past were just appearances and it was not even close to the real 'scraps\u201d!\u201cKinematics.\u201dJiang Fan continued to display the text, \u201cIt is the discipline of exploring the essential laws of all things in the world.\u201d\u201cWhen you figure these questions out\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a real beginner!\u201dAfter teaching this, Jiang Fan left a completely stunned Qi!The whole person was like enlightenment in the middle of a mist.A new light was found!Originally, after seeing the power of extraordinary people, he was a little anxious.Gradually, he calmed down.He began to seriously think about these few questions Jiang Fan left behind, sitting on top of a high platform all night long!But this era was still the feudal era.Much of this knowledge had yet to be discovered.Qi was even more talented.It was impossible to understand the principle overnight!But\u2026\u2026This night was the most important turning point in Qi\u2019s life.Since then, his focus shifted from the study of technology to the principle of things.As for technology, it was left to others to recruit more talents.It was also to encourage Xia Kingdom\u2019s people to go to school.Qi started the \u201cimperial examination\u201d!Examination there was not like the ancient times in the previous life.There was no examination for the eight units.There was no need to read the four books and five scriptures, no poems and songs.In literary politics, there was only one exam.In contrast, there were a lot more disciplines in \u201cKinetics\u201d!For better research, Qi split the original Kewu Academy!It was divided into \u201cKewu Academy\u201d and \u201cTiangong Academy\u201d.One focused on the study of the laws of the world.One was responsible for the research and development of process technology.If someone wanted to get into both academies he had to take the science test!\u201cTiangong Academy?\u201dJiang Fan naturally observed Qi\u2019s move.Before opening the hospital, Jiang Fan passed on a book to Qi\u2014\u2014\u201cTiangong\u201d!The author of \u201cTiangong\u201d was the ancient great scientist Song Yingxing on the previous earth.It was the first comprehensive work on agricultural and handicraft production on the former Earth.It was also a comprehensive scientific and technical work in ancient times, some people also called it an encyclopedic work.Foreign scholars called it \u201cthe encyclopedia of craftsmanship in the 17th century\u201d.The entire book contained production techniques for agriculture and handicrafts, such as machinery, brick, and tile, ceramics, sulfur, candles, paper, weapons, gunpowder, textiles, dyeing, salt making, coal mining, oil extraction, etc.The book corresponded exactly to the name of the Academy.Qi was overjoyed!With this book, he could greatly reduce the detours taken by the Xia kingdom!\u201cTiangong Kaiwu\u201d had since become the treasure of Tiangong Academy, it influenced generations of students.The evaluation in later generations was very high as compared with Tiangong Academy, which was easier to play a practical role.There were many fewer people who enrolled in Kewu Academy.The good thing was that with the strong support of Qi, the development of Kewu Academy was very smooth and the six questions Jiang Fan left were hung up high by Qi and it became the topic of the two academies!Qi announced that whoever could answer any one of these six questions would directly be awarded the position of professor and there were high prizes.Qi also set up a \u201cGreat Desolate Award\u201d to reward those who would make significant contributions to these six questions each year.With so many initiatives down the line, Qi and the two other academies were full of energy.It felt that these six questions would be solved soon.However, until the tenth year of the establishment of the two academies, someone solved the question.It was the second-easiest question.In the Tiangong Academy, a student who had been studying lenses for a long time accidentally produced the first microscope in the history of Blue Star!Before that, glass, glasses, magnifying glasses, etc were used.All had been invented, relying on this first humble microscope!People discovered the \u201cother world\u201d that shocked them!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Miniature World! The \u201cNobel Prize\u201d of the Great Desolate!Tiangong Academy, inside the laboratory beside a simple microscope, was crowded with many students who came to hear the news.One by one, they stood on tiptoes and looked at the student who was lying on the microscope.One hour ago, a piece of startling news quickly spread throughout the academy.Someone based on a magnifying glass made a new instrument and in this kind of instrument, something was different!Not long after, when everyone heard the news, Qi also hurried over.There was a hint of excitement on his face that was hard to conceal.Over the years, Jiang Fan\u2019s six questions were not resolved though.But there was a lot of progress!For the second question, there was more or less research and speculation.Many people gave their conclusions but it was never proven.With the help of a microscope, Qi saw the \u201cother world\u201d like never before.\u201cWhat are these??\u201dLooking inside the lens, one of the tiny objects appeared.Qi was surprised and delighted!\u201cIt\u2019s the same as I guessed before, that such tiny beings exist in this world!\u201d\u2026\u2026The microscope was undoubtedly a major invention!It uncovered the world of microbes!Soon after, cells were also discovered!People had initially opened the door about the creature itself!A new discipline\u2014Microbiology was officially established!Up to this point, regarding the second question raised by Jiang Fan, Qi had a definite answer.\u201cColdwater contains harmful microorganisms that are invisible to the naked eye, so people get sick when they drink it, but when the cold water is heated, these microorganisms are killed, and naturally the water becomes fine.\u201dQi solemnly wrote down the answer in his notebook.This year\u2019s \u201cGreat Desolate Award\u201d would go to the participant who invented the microscope and there was no doubt about that!\u2026\u2026Time went by under the acceleration of the awakening space above the Blue Star, the years passed calmly and comfortably.Ten years had passed in a flash!Kewu Academy and Tiangong Academy were secretly competing with each other.A lot of research results were emerging from each of them but there was no more invention of cross-generational significance like the microscope.The population of the Xia Kingdom continued to grow.Although there was no external threat, they still maintained a huge army!Many people were aware that outside this world, there were also many very powerful civilizations. Everyone there was as powerful as a fierce beast. So, the invasion was possible at any time!Of course, this was the rumor on the street.Qi also did not bother to dispel the rumors.It was better to have a sense of crisis than none at all.With the help of two academies, the weapons of the army had developed rapidly.In particular, many resources were plundered from the Warrior Planet last time.There were also dozens of tons of iron ore that could be used to make even sharper weapons.The research and development of bows and crossbows was a top priority, especially with the creation of large crossbows!In addition to the weapons, the formation of the cavalry was another priority!Thanks to the superior environment of Blue Star, in the north, a large area of rain-fed grassland was distributed. A large number of wild horses lived there.One with excellent genes could be said to be a tall horse.Following Jiang Fan\u2019s instructions, the wild horses of the previous generation had been domesticated.By the time of Qi\u2019s generation, domestication was still ongoing.Later, with the help of the Academy, domesticating and breeding war horses became much easier and a branch of cavalry was also formally formed.Priority was given to crafting saddles and stirrups as well as bows and crossbows.The level of technology in the Xia Kingdom that day was higher than any dynasty in the ancient times of his previous life!However, it was limited by the lack of many resources and was not yet able to surge!Jiang Fan who was watching couldn\u2019t help but nod secretly.It was almost comparable to the industrialization level of the previous life.Under gradual development, Qi as the head of a country was aging with each passing day due to the dual management of state affairs and material research.He started to get sick!The medical aspect of the Xia Kingdom hadn\u2019t been much developed.Life expectancy was not high at that time.At this point, Qi also had to consider the issue of the successor to the throne.Unlike Desolate, Qi did not marry many wives.Children were also relatively few.They were rarely disciplined and taught at ordinary times.In this kind of situation plus a peaceful environment, Qi\u2019s sons were relatively mediocre.None of them stood out above the courtroom.The princes, several of whom each had many supporters!There was no first-born son succession here.The ministers argued fiercely every day and Qi was also very distressed.He could not tell which one was more suitable to succeed the throne.Qi thought of the first time he saw Jiang Fan at that time.It seems that\u2026\u2026At that time, Jiang Fan chose the successor for Desolate, so Qi started calling out to Jiang Fan.He was ready to let Jiang Fan decide the next emperor once again!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Great Wisdom! Medical genius!When Qi called Jiang Fan, he naturally noticed it and he was also observing Qi\u2019s sons.Qi had few sons.There were less than twenty in total.Among them, four also died only thirteen sons left!Among the many sons of this generation of Qi, there was not a single one with outstanding talent like the previous desolate generation\u2019s reluctance.There should be the kind of person who was extraordinary since childhood!Seeing Qi in a difficult decision, Jiang Fan decided to help him out!Of course, he helped mainly for the better development of Blue Star.Today\u2019s the Xia Kingdom was still in the feudal era.It would still take a lot of time to develop because technological breakthroughs were not that easy and people\u2019s ideas couldn\u2019t be changed in a short period.\u201cSystem, help me deduce, among Qi\u2019s many sons, who is the most suitable to be the emperor, and who is the most powerful for Blue Star\u2019s technological development?\u201dJiang Fan asked.Soon, the deduction results came out-Deduction result: Han has outstanding talent and great perseverance.\u201cHan?\u201dJiang Fan raised his eyebrows.He was a little surprised because Han was ranked seventh among many princes.He was weak and sick since childhood and was very unremarkable.He didn\u2019t show any special talent.Jiang Fan personally observed Han a few times.He looked ordinary and unremarkable.\u201cSystem, let\u2019s deduce Han\u2019s talent.\u201dJiang Fan continued to use the system.Deduction result: Han has medical talent.\u201cIt turned out to be medicine?\u201dJiang Fan suddenly realized his talent in this field, unlike other fields.It wasn\u2019t that easy to discover.For example, geniuses in music, literature, art, and even mathematics, physics, etc.It was easy to show from an early age, let people see how special they were.While medicine was of course unlikely.\u201cAmong the many princes, only this Han has talent. It just so happens that medicine is the weak point of the Xia Kingdom.\u201dJiang Fan thought for a while and quickly made a decision.He informed Qi in the royal study of the results.\u201cHan?!\u201dWhen Qi saw the text displayed by Jiang Fan, he was a little surprised.Even he could not remember the age and appearance of his son!\u201cIn the future, I will bring Han over. I\u2019ll personally teach him.\u201d Jiang Fan left after leaving a message.\u201cThank you, Father!\u201dQi was overjoyed.He knew that Han was just an ordinary person or a middle-aged person.Even if he was chosen as the successor, he couldn\u2019t be qualified to have Jiang Fan\u2019s personal teaching.\u2026\u2026Since then, in a room next to the imperial study, Han often came there and he accepted Jiang Fan\u2019s teachings.Han was honest and there was a hint of wisdom.At that time, as for God Father Jiang Fan\u2019s various miracles, Prince Han was not that surprised.Because\u2026\u2026Qi muttered to himself in the room sometimes so Han noticed it plus the technical explosion in the Xia Kingdom.There were rumors in the palace that Qi was the son of heavens and was blessed by the gods and he can communicate with the gods!\u2026\u2026\u201cFather, this is the drug I made, which saved the lives of many soldiers today.\u201dTen-year-old Han was holding a bottle of unknown liquid in his hand, his little face could not hide his excitement.In this era, it was easy to die if someone caught a cold or got hurt and the serious illness was almost incurable.\u201cWell done.\u201d Jiang Fan applauded.Han was not that smart but his perseverance was extraordinary.A serving of alcohol for disinfection.After hundreds of experiments, the ratio was finally perfect!\u201cThis kind of personality is suitable for medicine.\u201dJiang Fan nodded slightly.Jiang Fan\u2019s teachings were well-determined.He only proposed some basic concepts and then he would let Han test it himself.Qi was also a strong supporter inside Kewu academy.A small medical research laboratory was established.There was a steady flow of funds and resources.Medical talents were also recruited from all over the Kingdom to join the institute.In the following years, the medical research laboratory had gradually achieved results.The first major invention, Anesthesia was developed by Han!This was a historic moment, even in his previous life.Anesthetics was also one of the most important inventions in the history of medicine!Not long after, the second major invention, Penicillin was born!The invention of penicillin greatly reduced the death rate of the Xia Kingdom\u2019s soldiers!It also made the medical research laboratory famous.Realizing the importance of medicine, he began to consider separating the medical laboratory.One month later, after Kewu academy and Tiangong academy.The third academy \u2013The School of Medicine was established!Han, who was only fifteen, was appointed as the headmaster!The Great Desolate Award for the past two years, unsurprisingly obtained by Han, who invented anesthesia and penicillin!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Blue Star\u2019s Specialty! The discovery of Vibranium!After Han won two consecutive Great Desolate Awards, medicine began to receive unprecedented attention and welcome in the Xia Kingdom and it was also widely promoted!The medical conditions of the entire Xia Kingdom had risen to a new level.Jiang Fan also gradually reduced his teaching to Han.For Jiang Fan, stealth guidance was the main way, not as a last resort.He was not prepared to be like a stuffed duck and throw knowledge into the people there!\u2026\u2026\u201cThe weather is nice today.\u201dJiang Fan, whose thoughts returned to the living room, glanced at the weather outside.There were some white clouds in the blue sky.The federal relief house where Jiang Fan lived had one bedroom, one living room, and one kitchen!The total area was less than 40 square meters.It was very cramped.Jiang Fan went to the small restaurant he usually went to, intending to solve his stomach problem.These days, he was busy with the evolution of Blue Star.He didn\u2019t even have time to cook for himself.Crackle\u2026\u2026The sound of firecrackers suddenly sounded!Jiang Fan looked forward.He saw it by the road, and an oversized firecracker was being lit.A loud sound could be heard from a distance.There were a lot of people around to discuss.\u201cIs Old Xu making a lot of money? Setting off firecrackers for no reason?\u201d\u201cMaking a lot of money? You won\u2019t be so happy when you make money.\u201d\u201cYou all don\u2019t know. Old Xu\u2019s daughter has awakened an intermediate civilization planet, and she has already been chosen by a Level 3 planet master and accepted as a disciple.\u201d\u201cF*ck?!\u201d\u201cBeing accepted as a disciple by the level 3 planet master, the old Xu family has handed her over.\u201d\u201cOld Xu\u2019s daughter will win the college entrance exam. She will be able to get a good result and enter a good university.\u201d\u201cIt would be great if that kid in my family could be accepted as a disciple by the third-level planet master.\u201d\u201cWake up. Old Xu\u2019s daughter is probably the most talented among us. That\u2019s why she\u2019s chosen.\u201d\u2026\u2026There were a lot of discussions.Jiang Fan naturally listened.As for the level 3 planet master or something, Jiang Fan didn\u2019t pay attention at all.\u201cCollege Entrance Examination?\u201dJiang Fan recited this term in his mouth.This world also had college entrance exams.If anyone wanted to go to college, the college entrance examination was a must.The university also had a good difference, with the help of the deduction system, Jiang Fan\u2019s goal was naturally the top universities.When Jiang Fan returned home, his thoughts entered the awakening space again.His gaze turned to the Xia Kingdom\u2019s army.On another planet, unlike Jiang Fan\u2019s Blue Star, there were a lot of non-combatants.All of them were martial artists or magicians!All soldiers!Jiang Fan also did not dare to be careless.The number of Xia Kingdom\u2019s army was slowly increasing.The Great Desolate Army had also expanded to 30,000 people!Among them, the cavalry force reached 10,000, and they were training desperately every day.In a grassy area, Jiang Fan saw a group of soldiers surrounding and killing a giant elephant!To be precise it was not an elephant.Rather, it was a product unique to this planet, Desolate elephant!A behemoth that combined the characteristics of a mammoth and an elephant was the evolution of the Blue Star.It was roughly the same as the Earth in his previous life, but the details were different.Resulting in\u2026\u2026There was a portion of the species that did not exist on Earth.For example, a big guy like a desolate elephant.Another example was some fishes in the rivers and lakes.Against the desolate elephant, soldiers had become very skilled.Swish!Swish!Swish!\u2026\u2026One after another, crossbows and arrows flew out and were accurately hitting the desolate elephant.But the desolate elephant was thick-skinned, ordinary bows and arrows couldn\u2019t pose much of a threat to it.\u201cHuh?\u201dJiang Fan suddenly noticed that among them, one arrow\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t quite right.Generally speaking, the speed of the arrows was above and below one hundred meters per second but this arrow was obviously much faster than other arrows, it was more than 150 meters per second.Jiang Fan carefully checked it out and discovered that the arrow was repaired and forged by the soldiers who used it.The original arrow was broken and there was no extra iron, so they replaced it with other metals.After all, there was still too little iron ore.Jiang Fan took a closer look at this metal and found out that he didn\u2019t recognize it.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026 Blue Star Exclusive product?\u201dJiang Fan had a preliminary guess in his heart.It was not just the species but there were also minerals.Blue Star might also have evolved different species from Earth, but because it was buried in the ground, Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t find them one by one.For this kind of metal, that could accelerate the bow and arrow, Jiang Fan became interested.After half a day of observation, his face became a little weird.\u201cThis metal\u2026\u2026\u201dThe more Jiang Fan looked at it, the more he thought.The properties exhibited by this unknown metal were very much like a product of a science fiction work in his previous life-Vibranium!Was it the same thing?Jiang Fan thought about it.He found Qi and let him dig out more of this metal and conduct deep research!\u201cIf it\u2019s true, it\u2019ll be interesting.\u201dJiang Fan thought with some anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Amazing Vibranium! Sound-absorbing steel!Due to the speed of time flow, Jiang Fan just went out for a meal.A year had passed on the Blue Star.When Jiang Fan saw Qi again, Qi was visibly old, not too old, less than forty years old but the temples were gray and wrinkled.The whole person had become much thinner.\u201cFather!\u201dQi was very excited to see Jiang Fan.Since Jiang Fan personally taught Han, Qi never communicated with Jiang Fan again!Jiang Fan told him a sentence, Qi immediately sent someone to find this soldier.According to the story of the soldier, at a place in the grassland, more of this unknown metal was the dugout.From the appearance, it looked ordinary and was no different from other ores.If Jiang Fan hadn\u2019t personally witnessed the uniqueness of that arrow, he probably wouldn\u2019t pay much attention.After excavating unknown metal, Qi dispatched an elite squad to escort it back to the palace.Inside the palace, Qi had a research room of his own; the unknown metal was sent there.Meanwhile, Qi also recruited the Great Desolate Army and kept the place under close guard, even a fly couldn\u2019t get out.Although Qi was old, his brain was not old at all.Knowing that this kind of metal could attract Father\u2019s attention was not simple.\u201cFather, what is this?\u201dQi carefully held it and looked at it. Naturally, he did not recognize it.\u201cFirst test is to measure the characteristics of this unknown metal.\u201dJiang Fan didn\u2019t say it straight.In fact, Jiang Fan was not completely sure.Vibranium\u2026\u2026That was the product of a science fiction movie in his previous life, it was also known as sound-absorbing steel.In the Marvel Universe, it was one of the hardest materials.Specialty resources from Wakanda had been featured in many movies.One of the most famous was a certain captain\u2019s shield and Black Panther\u2019s battle suit and claws.Even in the movie, Vibranium was also rare.Black Panther\u2019s father only sold a small amount of vibranium and it was enough to send domestic bachelors to study in foreign countries.This made Wakanda a high-tech country but even if this unknown metal was not vibranium, it should also be very qualitative.Qi nodded.He personally led the team and performed tests on the unknown metal.In addition to medical and other disciplines, Qi could be said to be an all-rounder.There were certain achievements in most fields.Jiang Fan watched quietly from the sidelines.First, the unknown metal itself was tested for its properties and the results came out soon.This unknown metal could not conduct heat and was very strong but Jiang Fan was somewhat disappointed because it was not indestructible.\u201cIt\u2019s not vibranium!\u201dSeeing this, Jiang Fan already concluded.In the Marvelous movies of his previous life, Vibranium was very hard, and its special molecular structure made it almost indestructible.As its molecules were relatively stationary, it made it almost non-conductive of heat and kinetic energy, this property allowed it to absorb heat, energy, and kinetic energy.Jiang Fan was not totally disappointed because this unknown metal\u2019s hardness was still very high.Someone had to use the hammer dozens of times to smash it!By the next test, Jiang Fan was surprised because this unknown metal could absorb sound and could convert it into its own kinetic energy.Several arrows were built with this unknown metal and soldiers were ordered to come and shoot arrows.After several rounds of testing, he unexpectedly found, why the arrow of the unknown metal was so much faster than the ordinary arrow.The main reason was that it could absorb sound!The louder the archer\u2019s voice, the faster it would be and what surprised Jiang Fan was that only the human voice worked on it.With the sound of the tool, there was no such effect.Qi and a few metal scholars next to him were looking dumbfounded with an unbelievable look!\u201cVibranium is also known as sound-absorbing steel, could it be\u2026\u2026 This unknown metal is a weakened version of vibranium?\u201dJiang Fan had a preliminary guess.If it was vibranium then it was hard for Jiang Fan to believe it.After all this Blue Star had only just awakened.Jiang Fan felt that Blue Star\u2019s talent was higher than that of Earth in his previous life but it was not possible to give birth to the \u201cvibranium\u201d thing.If it was a weakened version, that would be more acceptable.Therefore, the next test was the main focus on the characteristics of Vibranium.The result was in line with Jiang Fan\u2019s guess.This unknown metal could also absorb heat, energy, and kinetic energy to some extent!!!After getting here, Jiang Fan was almost certain.This unknown metal was the weakened version of vibranium!\u201cFather! Please give a name to this metal!\u201dQi\u2019s face was full of joy as he asked Jiang Fan for instructions.\u201cJust call it\u2026\u2026 Vibranium.\u201dJiang Fan was also too lazy to rename.Since it was so much like vibranium that\u2019s the name.\u201cVibranium? Good name.\u201dQi didn\u2019t pay that much attention. As long as it was Jiang Fan, he would naturally agree.The characteristic test of vibranium was finished.Qi then immediately ordered not to leak any information and then he dispatched his beloved soldiers to the location where vibranium was found.He was planning to explore more vibranium and the use of vibranium was also on the agenda!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Vibranium Metal! News of the Grand Tournament!The first was the tests of the vibranium, it was relatively simple.Only a few of the most critical properties and attributes were tested and it had already surprised Qi and several scholars.It was very hard and was absorbing heat, energy, and kinetic energy!It could also absorb the surrounding sound and turn it into potential energy.Follow-up tests continued whereas soldiers who went to explore the number of vibranium\u2019s reserves turned the whole grassland upside down.Ultimately they found about a hundred pounds of vibranium!This quantity was indeed very little but the connection to the special nature of vibranium was also good.Besides, the area of the current Blue Star was still a little too small so the use of vibranium was also on the agenda as it was most obvious.Naturally, it would be used as arrows for bows, as for the rest of it, Jiang Fan did not bother and handed it over to Qi.He checked out the planet panel, today\u2019s Blue Star was naturally rising further in size with the increase in population \u2013\u2026\u2026Planet name: Blue StarPlanet level: Level 1Diameter of the planet: 351.4 kmPlanet species: 1250Deduction route: none\u2026\u2026The diameter had increased a lot.The increase in the number of species was not much but with this diameter of the planet, Jiang Fan was quite satisfied.Just as Jiang Fan was about to take a short break, the communicator suddenly sounded.There was a notification that someone was requesting communication.Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.He had been an orphan since he was a child.Usually, he kept a low profile in his class.The communicator of Jiang Fan was more like an ornament.He picked up the communicator and took a look, but it was an unfamiliar number.Jiang Fan thought for a moment, and picked up, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cHello, classmate Jiang Fan.\u201dA familiar man\u2019s voice came from the opposite side.Jiang Fan was faintly stunned.He immediately thought about it, wasn\u2019t that the Principal Tong Zhensheng who he met last time?\u201cHello, principal.\u201dJiang Fan greeted and asked directly, \u201cI wonder why the principal wants to see me?\u201dJiang Fan had a straightforward temper since he was a child.He was not into nonsense and favors, so he had relatively few friends.\u201cStudent Jiang Fan, how is your planet doing?\u201dTong Zhensheng said in a gentle tone: \u201cThe school is currently making statistics on the situation of each student.\u201d\u201cThe statistics are\u2026\u2026\u201dTong Zhensheng paused for a moment and asked, \u201cDo you know about the Jiangcheng Grand Tournament?\u201d\u201cOf course, I know.\u201dJiang Fan said.Jiang Fan also inherited the memory of his predecessor.The so-called Jiangcheng Grand Tournament.It was an annual event held by the City Lord\u2019s Mansion and the contestants were talented students from various secondary schools.Some people also called it the \u201cJiangcheng Genius War\u201d.\u201cJiangcheng is the most important simulation before the college entrance examination.\u201d\u201cNot only can you show your strength, but you can also find out some of the basics of the talented students.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u2026\u201dTong Zhensheng explained: \u201cThis year\u2019s competition is quite special.\u201dJiang Fan didn\u2019t say anything, he chose to listen quietly.Tong Zhensheng couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.According to common sense, at this time, Jiang Fan shouldn\u2019t ask \u201chow special\u201d or something like this.As a result, he felt helpless.Tong Zhensheng could only continue the stand-up comedy, and continued: \u201cThe rules of this year\u2019s competition are still the same as in previous years, with five students from each school.\u201d\u201cThat also goes for our No. 7 Middle School.\u201d\u201cAs per the old rules, to save time.\u201d\u201cThe school will select the top five participants directly according to the size of the planet\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCome and participate in this competition.\u201d\u201cSo student Jiang Fan, what is the diameter of your planet now?\u201dTong Zhensheng finished in one breath.The speech was very fluent.\u201c351.4 kilometers.\u201dJiang Fan didn\u2019t have anything to hide, he told the truth.\u201c351.4 kilometers?\u201dTong Zhensheng couldn\u2019t help but be slightly taken aback.Half a month had passed since the awakening, during that time, many participants were vigorously developing planets.According to the information that Tong Zhensheng knew, there were already trainees with the diameter of the planet.It was several times more than when it was first awakened.Jiang Fan broke the record of Jiangcheng.The planet was 35.2 km in diameter at the time it was awakened and it was only an ordinary energy planet but Tong Zhensheng still felt that there should be some potential.Unexpectedly, it was not only increased by 20 kilometers, but it was also just over 50 km.Even some intermediate-level trainees couldn\u2019t compete anymore.This time, Tong Zhensheng personally called over and asked.It was because he had expectations for Jiang Fan\u2019s planet.After a short silence, he started comforting: \u201cThis\u2026\u2026 is not bad, you can add so much to an ordinary planet, it is still relatively\u2026\u201dComforting, comforting, Tong Zhensheng\u2019s words suddenly came to an abrupt end.A few moments later, he seemed to recall something.His voice suddenly became sharp: \u201cWhat did you say? 351.4 kilometers?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 The stunned principal!\u201cYes, 351.4 kilometers.\u201d Jiang Fan calmly said.Clap!Jiang Fan heard from the opposite of the communicator, there was a sound of something falling.A few moments later, Tong Zhensheng\u2019s voice, which was still gentle but seemed to have just watched a horror movie, came, and asked, \u201cStudent Jiang Fan, are you sure you awakened an ordinary planet?\u201d\u201cOf course this is certain. I can still distinguish between ordinary energy and extraordinary energy.\u201d Jiang Fan said.\u201cGood, good.\u201d Tong Zhensheng realized that his question was a bit inappropriate.Immediately, he snorted.\u201cPrincipal, my current planet size should be able to rank, right?\u201dJiang Fan asked.It was awakened for half a month.How were the planets of other students developing?Jiang Fan had no insider access.Naturally, it was not very clear.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTong Zhensheng just wanted to curse.A 351.4 km diameter planet? and now he was asking 'should or should not\u201d?Earlier, one of the best students in planetary development was only just over 100 kilometers while Jiang Fan\u2019s planet was 351.4 km in diameter, it was extremely demonic.It also broke the record of Jiangcheng, but looking at the whole world Tong Zhensheng had seen something more exaggerated than this.But now\u2026\u2026He saw an extraordinary planet awakened in less than half a month.Tong Zhensheng heard that some talented students had planets with a diameter of more than 100 kilometers.There were others with more than 150 km!Some students had more than 200 km!But he never heard about someone capable of exceeding 300 km!!!This could no longer be described with the word monster.It was outrageous!!!He took a deep breath and regained a sense of calm and said, \u201cYour grade is currently the first among all the students in our school, so you don\u2019t have to worry about not being selected for the competition.\u201d\u201cSelected for competition?\u201dJiang Fan was stunned for a moment, and then said, \u201cThat\u2026\u2026 can I not participate?\u201dFor Jiang Fan, there was no point in taking part in the so-called competition.He might use that time to improve Blue Star or go to the planet association more often to take the task.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to participate?\u201dTong Zhensheng was also stunned.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much time right now.\u201dJiang Fan found a common excuse.\u201cHow does that work?\u201dTong Zhensheng suddenly became anxious because he had a planet over 300 kilometers in diameter. How could he not participate?Immediately, he persuaded bitterly: \u201cThis year\u2019s Competition is a bit special than the previous years, the person who stood first will not only get a hundred million prize money and a chance to pick a resource crystal from the City Lord\u2019s treasury but he will also get an opportunity for personal guidance from the City Lord!\u201dIn the last sentence, Tong Zhensheng strengthened his tone heavily.\u201cOur Jiangcheng City Lord is a fifth-level planet master, this is a rare opportunity.\u201dHe was afraid that Jiang Fan would not agree, so Tong Zhensheng finally added another sentence.\u201cA hundred million in prize money?\u201dJiang Fan\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.For Jiang Fan, who was extremely short of money, this was undoubtedly a huge sum of money!\u201cAs the Blue Star increases in size, the time flow consumes more and more origin power, and the half portion of origin power is estimated to run out in no time.\u201dJiang Fan was thinking inside.\u201cIf I can get this one hundred million.\u201d\u201cBefore the entrance exam.\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to worry about the power of the origin any more.\u201dAs for\u2026\u2026Who cares about the personal guidance of the City Lord.For Jiang Fan, it didn\u2019t make much sense.After thinking about it, Jiang Fan made a decision and said, \u201cWell then, if I meet the qualifications, I will participate.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll put your name on it right away.\u201dTong Zhensheng\u2019s voice was loud and authentic.\u2026\u2026In no. 7 High School Principal\u2019s Office.After the communication ended, Tong Zhensheng leaned back in his chair and took a long sigh of relief.He was frightened all his life, but not as much as this month.If it could be said that Jiang Fan\u2019s awakening planet, which broke Jiangcheng\u2019s record, could be just an ordinary planet, in the end, that would be a surprise for him.\u201c351.4 kilometers?\u201dTong Zhensheng muttered the number.Immediately, the teacher who was in charge of counting the results of each student was called.A few moments later, the teacher in charge of statistics walked in.He was holding a statistical result in his hand.He handed it over and said, \u201cPrincipal, these are the top five students in our school\u2019s planetary diameter ranking. Take a look.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dTong Zhensheng picked it up and looked at it a few times.It could be said that this year\u2019s result was much better than the previous years.If it was previous years, Tong Zhensheng would also ask a few more questions about these students but thinking of Jiang Fan\u2019s achievements, Tong Zhensheng lost interest.He directly crossed out the name of the last student with a pen and added Jiang Fan\u2019s name, and said, \u201cThis is the final list. You are responsible for notifying other teachers.\u201dThe teacher looked at Tong Zhensheng\u2019s move with some confusion but didn\u2019t dare to say anything and left.\u201cHow nice it would be if this little guy awakened a planet with super energy.\u201dTong Zhensheng thought with some regret.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Sound Absorbing Arrows! Born to be a soldier!\u201cOne hundred million.\u201dAfter finishing the communication with Tong Zhensheng, Jiang Fan recited these words.With that, he entered the awakening space and observed the development of the Xia Kingdom.He had decided to participate in the Jiangcheng Competition in half a month so Jiang Fan naturally couldn\u2019t take it lightly.He was planning to be well prepared!\u2026\u2026Inside the Imperial Palace.Transcendental Research Laboratory.It was late at night.However, in the research room.The lights were still on.Qi and several experts were working all night to conduct practical tests of vibranium!Qi\u2019s face was a little tired, but there was still a hint of excitement and eagerness in his eyes.That was yearning for a new field!The air vibrated gently and Qi\u2019s body was revived.With that, he flew to another room.With an excited and thrilled expression, he said, \u201cFather!\u201d\u201cHow are the experiments on vibranium progressing?\u201d Jiang Fan asked.Although Jiang Fan judged that it should be the weakened version of Vibranium, its practical application was not determined yet.\u201cWe conducted various experiments during this time, and the results are Surprising!\u201d\u201cThis metal has all kinds of unimaginable properties!\u201d\u201cFather, I\u2019ll let the soldiers demonstrate.\u201d\u201cYou can see for yourself,\u201d Qi said.Qi gave the order, let the soldier take out the weapon made of vibranium, and conduct a field test.First, the arrow was made of vibranium!\u201cFather, please look.\u201dQi pointed to the arrow and introduced, \u201cThis arrow is an alloy made of vibranium and other metal.\u201d\u201cCompared to just vibranium.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s far from being less effective.\u201d\u201cInstead\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are also some enhancements.\u201d\u201cIn the previous experiment, we found out that the vibranium was both hammered and beaten in the process.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as metals like copper and iron.\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be any losses.\u201dQi\u2019s tone became more and more exciting! He was almost dancing with his hands.In front of Jiang Fan, Qi put down the frame of the emperor, just like a little kid who got a new toy!\u201cThen\u2026\u2026 we combined the vibranium with other metals and beat them into an alloy.\u201d\u201cDozens of metals were tested.\u201d\u201cIn the end, the most suitable of these were selected.\u201d\u201cAnd was surprised to find out the various properties of this alloy.\u201d\u201cSurprisingly, it\u2019s not weaker than Vibranium at all.\u201d\u201cAnd even a little stronger.\u201d\u201cWell done.\u201dJiang Fan complimented, and then asked, \u201cHow much is the current storage of vibranium?\u201d\u201cNot many stocks have been found so far.\u201dQi said with some regret: \u201cIncluding the last excavation, a total of less than three hundred pounds.\u201d\u201cIn the other parts of the planet, I am sending people to search with all their might.\u201d\u201cThe good thing is that it can be made into an alloy and the vibranium will not be consumed.\u201d\u201cSo, it should be able to support an army!\u201dAfter a pause, Qi hesitated for a moment, but still said, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Vibranium has a weakness.\u201d\u201cWhat weakness?\u201dJiang Fan asked.\u201cFather, see it yourself.\u201dQi ordered the soldiers to start the test.In the middle of the field.A fire was started, separated by a distance of 100 meters, a soldier with a strong body held a bow and arrow.The arrow was an alloy made of vibranium!Only to hear the soldier suddenly shout loudly, he bent the bow and shot.The arrow was like a meteor.It was shooting quickly toward the fire.\u201cNow this kind of arrow made of vibranium, used by ordinary soldiers, has a speed of about one hundred and fifty meters.\u201dQi introduced the concept of numbers and speed.It was already taught by Jiang Fan back in the desolate era.\u201cSoldiers will be faster if they have a loud voice and a lot of momentum.\u201d\u201cAtmospheric?\u201dJiang Fan was keenly aware of these words in Qi\u2019s words.\u201cYes, this is a new discovery.\u201dQi said excitedly, \u201cVibranium is not just able to absorb sound, it seems\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt can also absorb everyone\u2019s momentum!\u201d\u201cThe more momentum you have, the faster it is.\u201d\u201cOf course, the increase in momentum is much weaker than the sound.\u201d\u201cBut it also serves some purpose.\u201dHe ordered the soldiers to shoot bows and arrows.It had already crossed a distance of 100 meters, falling onto the fire.In the next moment, a surprising scene appeared.Just see\u2026\u2026This roaring fire suddenly and rapidly went out!\u201cShock absorbs energy such as kinetic and thermal energy from objects.\u201dQi had seen this kind of scene many times, but he calmly said: \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u2026 Father, look at it.\u201dHe looked in the direction indicated by Qi.Jiang Fan saw that inside the fire that went out, the arrow had been burned.There was only one arrow left.However\u2026\u2026The arrow had also turned black!\u201cAfter absorbing the heat, the vibranium will become like this and become waste.\u201dQi said with some regret.\u201cThere are no perfect items in the world.\u201dHowever, Jiang Fan didn\u2019t care.Instead, he thought\u2026\u2026That made sense!\u201cIn that case, the rest of vibranium will have to be saved.\u201dQi said helplessly.\u201cThis metal might work wonders against extraordinary people.\u201dJiang Fan was in deep thought.\u201cMaybe we can try it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Slime Planet! SpongeBob Civilization!The soldiers in the army of Xia Kingdom had reached 50,000!This was the regular army.If you count the reserves, it was estimated that it could be as many as 100,000 and the population of the Xia Kingdom was only over one million.With such a huge army, the economic pressure on the Xia Kingdom was not small.Every day in the courtroom, ministers who didn\u2019t know the truth were clamoring for disarmament!Qi just started to make excuses.Later on, they didn\u2019t even bother to pay attention to the existence of aliens.Only a small number of people knew about the Qi and the Transcendental Research Laboratory and about the Great Desolate Army!It was strictly confidential so that others had not been informed yet.Jiang Fan also felt that it was not yet time for the world to know.The Great Desolate Army expanded to 30,000 while there were 10,000 cavalries!There was no other way because the formation of cavalry was too costly!The consumption of 10,000 cavalries for one year was almost equivalent to 100,000 infantry!Watching the Great Desolate Army sweating like rain in training, an idea came to Jiang Fan\u2019s mind.Last time on that warrior planet, the Great Desolate Army was brave but in front of the warriors, they still couldn\u2019t help but feel timid!\u201cThere is still a need for more realistic combat and by this kind of training, even hunting and killing fierce beasts every day is useless, warriors and fierce beasts are not a category after all.\u201dJiang Fan secretly thought.He immediately found Qi and informed his thoughts.\u201cThe Father is preparing\u2026\u2026 to go to the outer planets again?!\u201dQi\u2019s eyes widened, instead, a hint of anticipation appeared in his eyes.\u201cThe greatest challenge that the warriors of Xia kingdom will face in the future is the transcendents of each planet.\u201dJiang Fan displayed the text and said, \u201cAnd among the transcendents\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe gap is extremely large.\u201d\u201cThe warriors you saw last time were just one of the most common ones.\u201d\u201cIf you encounter other more special extraordinary people.\u201d\u201cOne must be more prepared.\u201dHearing Jiang Fan\u2019s implicit reminder.Qi also thought of the last time.The Great Desolate Army was victorious in the end, but the performance of each soldier was not as much as it should be.There were quite a few soldiers who saw the warriors flying and disappeared like a figure.They were so scared that they did not dare to act rashly!There were a few soldiers who got the fear of warriors after the battle!\u201cFather is right.\u201dQi nodded and said with a serious face, \u201cIndeed, the generals of the Xia Kingdom did not perform well enough when they were facing the Transcendents.\u201d\u201cThey need more hands-on practice.\u201d\u201cPlease help Father!\u201dQi bowed deeply!\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201dJiang Fan manipulated the water vapor writing and said, \u201cThis is supposed to be my business.\u201d\u201cGet ready.\u201d\u201cTen days later, there will be a new planet passage opening.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still in the same place!\u201dPlanet Passage was the same each time it was opened.The passage of the Xia Kingdom was located near the Great Desolate City in a mountain range.That day this mountain range had been heavily surrounded, no outsider could get in.The passage was heavily guarded!The training place of the Great Desolate Army was not far away.\u201cThank you, Father.\u201dQi still said respectfully.There was a hint of anticipation in his eyes.If it was before, Qi would have anxiety about how to deal with transcendents.But after getting the vibranium, that anxiety was much less.At the very least, Vibranium gave him the hope of being able to fight transcendents!\u2026\u2026After coming out of the awakening space, Jiang Fan left his home.He came to the Planet Association!He was ready to pick a few low-level civilization planets.It was still the same window as last time and the same good-looking young female staff member was seeing Jiang Fan.The young female staff member\u2019s eyes lit up and the smile on her face became a little strong as she said, \u201cHello Mr. Jiang, what can I help you with today?\u201d\u201cI want to train the soldiers on my planet, can you check which planets are suitable?\u201dJiang Fan said.\u201cA planet for training?\u201dAfter listening to this, the female staff lightly pulled up a panel and said, \u201cIf you mainly want it to use for training, then\u2026\u2026 I suggest using a weaker planet.\u201d\u201cYou can check these out.\u201dJiang Fan looked at the panel, there were various low-level energy planets!After looking at it for a few moments, Jiang Fan\u2019s face became a little odd.The topmost Slime planet was okay.But below this\u2026\u2026 What the hell was SpongeBob?!Seeing Jiang Fan\u2019s gaze fixed on the second planet, the female staff member explained, \u201cOn this planet, there is a kind of intelligent creature called \u2018SpongeBob\u2019. It lives in the deep sea and its combat strength is not strong, so it is very suitable for training.\u201d\u201cSince they live in the deep sea, how are they going to fight?\u201dJiang Fan asked.\u201cThey can be lured to the surface to fight and are suitable for training in water warfare.\u201dThe female staff said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are other options here.\u201dThe female staff pointed to a planet below and said, \u201cThis planet is a close relative of SpongeBob \u2013 Baby sponge.\u201d\u201cBaby sponge lives on the ground.\u201d\u201cThe strength is not strong either.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more appropriate as a target for ground combat.\u201dJiang Fan looked at the introduction of the two creatures, their names were familiar but they were genuine Extraordinary creatures.It didn\u2019t look cute at all, so he checked it carefully for a while.Then Jiang Fan made his decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: Transcendental Research Laboratory! New weapon era!Jiang Fan\u2019s choice was very simple.Among the low-level civilization planets, the warrior planet was the largest!It was also a favorite of various students who had awakened the low-level energy planets because the planet system of warriors was already very mature.As compared to other civilizations, it was relatively simple to create.Jiang Fan first selected three planets.Respectively \u2013Warrior Planet!Slime Planet!Fierce beasts Planet!Three different types of planets.Planet of the Fierce Beasts was a planet ruled by a fierce beast called \u201cRed Lion\u201d.Red Lion was said to be the descendant of the mythical lion in the advanced vicious beast civilization!It\u2019s just too far apart because the bloodline was already very weak.As compared with warriors, Red Lion\u2019s battle power was even stronger but the wisdom was relatively low!Jiang Fan was planning to let the Great Desolate Army enter these planets after a month for training.After paying the toll, Jiang Fan glanced at the female staff member and said with some curiosity, \u201cDo you know\u2026\u2026 Is there an Ultraman planet among the many planets?\u201d\u201cUltraman planet?\u201dThe female staff member was slightly taken aback.Followed by a slight frown.After seriously thinking about it.After thinking for a long time, she shook her head and said, \u201cIt seems \u2026\u2026 Never heard of such a planet, where did you hear about it?\u201d\u201cThen maybe I heard it wrong.\u201dJiang Fan smiled faintly.\u2026\u2026After returning to the awakening space.Jiang Fan found Qi and told his decision.\u201cIn the future, the passage will open on the first day of the month. These three planets are all extraordinary planets, and they all have unexpected dangers.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 must be prepared.\u201d\u201cThe Great Desolate Army is ready.\u201dQi was full of ambition and said, \u201cThe Transcendental Research Laboratory has also produced some results recently.\u201d\u201cWhat results?\u201dJiang Fan became a little interested.This Transcendental Research Laboratory\u2019s main Purpose was the study of transcendentalists.Last time on the warrior planet, the corpses of the warriors they killed were shipped back and frozen with ice!It was then used for research, but at the very beginning there was no progress.Until later\u2026\u2026The establishment of the College of Science and Technology, especially the invention of the microscope, finally made some discoveries.\u201cFather, please come with me.\u201dQi quickly walked to the Transcendental Research Room.Inside the innermost room, the lab was set up.On the laboratory bench, there was a tall warrior\u2019s corpse lying there.The body had been dissected.Jiang Fan took a look.Wasn\u2019t that the bald guy?Qi pointed to the bald man\u2019s body and said, \u201cWe found that the bodies of these warriors are not much different from our ordinary people, or\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThey were originally ordinary people but the body possesses a mysterious energy.\u201d\u201cWith this kind of energy, their bodies became so strong!\u201d\u201cThis energy is called True Qi, and it is a kind of extraordinary energy.\u201dJiang Fan coped a little.\u201cSo it\u2019s called True Qi.\u201dQi said with some confusion, \u201cAnd we found out that this kind of extraordinary energy is a bit complicated and not pure enough.\u201d\u201cSo, these warriors cultivate.\u201d\u201cAs the cultivation becomes stronger there will be hidden problems in the body while cultivating.\u201dSpeaking of which, Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but nod slightly.Qi and a group of scholars from the research laboratory still worked hard.Although there were no advanced instruments but by guesswork and tireless dissection still researched the essential things.\u201cThe most important thing in this research on warriors is not to see the energy in their bodies, but\u2026\u2026\u201dQi\u2019s eyes were bright, and there seemed to be a glint in his eyes as he said, \u201cIt let us know.\u201d\u201cEven the transcendent was just a type of creature!\u201d\u201cIt also had its drawbacks!\u201d\u201cScantling, scantling!\u201d\u201cNot just everything in this world, but also the Transcendents!\u201d\u201cAs long as we study the laws of their nature, the transcendents are not that scary!\u201dQi finished in one breath.There was a mixture of confidence and excitement in his tone!\u201cYou finally understand.\u201d\u201cYou can start True physics now!\u201dQi was ecstatic in his heart, but his face was restrained, and he pretended to be calm!All along, Jiang Fan\u2019s six questions, Qi firmly remembered!There was a sigh of relief in his heart, wanting to prove himself.Today, Jiang Fan\u2019s approval let him finally feel a sense of accomplishment!\u201cFather!\u201dQi bowed down and requested, \u201cI request to personally lead this outer planet expedition.\u201dLast time he was young but this time he was already over 40!His aging was visible to the naked eye.\u201cNo.\u201dJiang Fan refused.Qi suddenly became anxious, and even shouted: \u201cFather! I still have spare power!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the reason.\u201d Jiang Fan quickly displayed the text and said: \u201cI have a more important thing for you to do!\u201d\u201cSomething more important than the conquest of the outer planets?\u201d Qi was a little confused.\u201cI told you once before about weapons that can exceed the speed of sound, do you remember?\u201d Jiang Fan\u2019s text was displayed more slowly this time.Qi replied, \u201cOf course, I remember that.\u201dQi won\u2019t forget what Jiang Fan said was almost impossible to make.Those weapons could only exist in the imagination!\u201cWhat I want you to do is related to this kind of weapon.\u201dJiang Fan displayed the text.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Gunpowder Arrives! A whole new field!\u201cFather! You mean\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan that supersonic weapon be made now?\u201dQi asked with shock and anticipation.\u201cYou think it\u2019s impossible?\u201dJiang Fan asked rhetorically.Qi was silent at once.After a while, he said, \u201cSupersonic weapons will be born in the future, but with the current technology and craftsmanship of the Xia Kingdom, it\u2019s hard to achieve.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s a bow and arrow made of vibranium.\u201d\u201cPlus the user factor.\u201d\u201cThe fastest speed today is only just over 200 meters!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201dQi looked at the place where Jiang Fan displayed the text and had a glint in his eyes and said, \u201cSince it was said by you, then there must be areas that I haven\u2019t touched.\u201d\u201cAfter all.\u201d\u201cI even have those six questions that Father mentioned.\u201d\u201cSo far, only one of them has been answered.\u201d\u201cYou do know yourself.\u201dJiang Fan also made a joke and said, \u201cYou guessed right, this supersonic speed involves the field of\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is true that you are relatively unfamiliar.\u201d\u201cDo you know what the speed of sound is?\u201dJiang Fan asked.\u201cIt\u2019s probably about 340 meters per second.\u201dQi replied immediately.Since Jiang Fan mentioned the concept of supersonic weapons, Qi was very interested in this.With the establishment of two academies, Kewu Academy and Tiangong Academy.There were many inventions and ideas born, testing the speed of sound was also in it.After several tests, Qi also measured the speed of the sound.\u201cThis is the speed in the air, if it were in the water, it would be a bit faster.\u201dQi added.\u201cSo to make supersonic weapons, it must not be an ordinary method.\u201dJiang Fan still displayed the text with water vapor: \u201cToday you are not responsible for supersonic weapons.\u201d\u201cBut it has a lot to do with supersonic weapons.\u201d\u201cYou can say that it\u2019s the basis for supersonic weapons!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a weapon!\u201d\u201cThe power is even greater than that of supersonic weapons!\u201d\u201cGreater than supersonic weapons?!\u201dQi was dumbfounded by what he heard.\u201cThe name of this weapon, I call it Gun Powder!\u201dJiang Fan continued to display the text.\u201cGun Powder?\u201dQi silently bookmarked this somewhat unfamiliar term in his head!Gun Powder was the epoch-making invention of the previous world.One could say that its creation would directly end the era of cold weapons!Of course, the history of Gun Powder in his previous life had lasted for over a thousand years.It didn\u2019t mature until later, it would be widely used in the military.Here Jiang Fan intended to directly propose this concept and then let Qi go to research and development!Gun Powder\u2019s raw materials were not complicated.It was made of saltpeter, carbon, and sulfur in a certain ratio.However\u2026\u2026It\u2019s also that Gun Powder\u2019s explosive power was several times different.For a considerable time in ancient times of his previous life, the so-called Gun Powder was simply a mixture of charcoal, sulfur, and nitrate.The ratios were varied, it was a loose mixture and it was not resistant to storage and transportation.It was susceptible to moisture, impurities, and less power, the actual power of the Gun Powder when it exploded, had a lot to do with the purity of raw materials, preparation process, compression, and sealing conditions.Until later, with advances in physics, chemistry, and mechanical engineering people would discover the best combination ratio of Gun Powder, which was\u2014Sulfur 10%, charcoal 15%, saltpeter 75%.Of course, Jiang Fan naturally wouldn\u2019t tell Qi directly about this ratio.According to the current level of technology, Xia Kingdom was in a position to be able to study this optimal ratio!\u201cSaltpeter, carbon, sulfur?\u201dHearing these three raw materials mentioned by Jiang Fan, Qi was instantly enlightened.Qi was naturally no stranger to these three substances.There were already people using it in the Xia Kingdom.That was the same fireworks as in his previous life!But even Qi didn\u2019t expect that.The supersonic weapon that had been on his mind, was hidden in the daily necessities!\u201cAren\u2019t these raw materials used for fireworks? But\u2026\u2026 the power of fireworks is not that great.\u201dQi secretly thought, \u201cThen it should be a matter of ratio.\u201dDuring the time Qi had been researching vibranium and alloys made from various metals, it was very clear that the ratio of each metal was just slightly different, while the difference in effect would be huge.\u201cFather, I have a preliminary idea in my mind.\u201dQi leaped forward and said.\u201cGo on then.\u201dJiang Fan smiled faintly.He also probably guessed that Qi should have thought of the ratio problem.Must say, Qi\u2019s scientific talent was extremely outstanding.He ended the exchange with Jiang Fan.Qi immediately assembled a team at the fastest speed to develop Gun Powder and was personally in charge!The location was within the imperial palace.During development, everyone else had to stay inside except Qi.The outside was guarded by heavy troops, even a fly could not get in easily!At the same time, Qi also set up the lead candidate for the expedition to the outer planets.There were no surprises.Naturally, it was Han who was chosen by Jiang Fan and for this expedition to the outer planets, all aspects were well-prepared.Along with the army, a ten-person transcendental research team was prepared, that would accompany the Great Desolate Army and personally travel to the outer planets to study the transcendent creatures of each planet face to face!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Entering the Slime Planet! Soft monsters!Compared to the Great Desolate Army, Jiang Fan\u2019s eyes were more on this ten-member transcendental research team!Among the ten people, there were men and women of all ages.Each one was a scholar, even half of them won the highest honor of the Xia Kingdom \u2013 the Great Desolate Award!Accompanying the Transcendental Research team there were also piles of various instruments, all kinds of microscopes, telescopes, reagent boxes, etc.Nothing was very advanced but that was the highest skill item that could be produced in this era.The last outer planet conquest was years ago, since then, many soldiers of the Great Desolate Army had been discharged!Most of them were newly selected soldiers so a look of nervousness and anticipation was on their faces.To ensure that this outer planet conquest would satisfy Jiang Fan, Qi had done a lot of work privately including a lot of simulation training.As well as very critical thought work and related science knowledge, not so many soldiers liked that last time.Seeing a warrior was a wimp in the heart!\u2026\u2026The first planet passage Jiang Fan chose was naturally the warrior planet.Let these people from Blue Star get familiar with it first.\u201cIs this an alien planet?\u201dThe people of the Transcendental Research Team looked at this martial planet with a look of curiosity.They picked up the binoculars and looked around!This time, Jiang Fan chose a low-level world.There were not many survivors on the planet.There were less than 50 people and their strength was also much weaker.For better training and research, the Great Desolate Army did not directly swarm.Instead, the team was divided into several branches.Over and over again\u2026\u2026Let each team go up to meet the enemy!To achieve the purpose of training, the Transcendental Research Team followed behind and watched carefully!Earlier in the laboratory, only cold corpses were studied.There was nothing like such an intuitive and shocking observation from a real person!\u201cIs this\u2026\u2026 an extraordinary one? It\u2019s really powerful.\u201d\u201cTo be precise, this is a warrior, a class of extraordinary people.\u201d\u201cDo your research, don\u2019t discuss this.\u201d\u2026\u2026After the first surprise, the Transcendental Research Team and the Great Desolate Army were not as fearful.A portion of the warriors was killed and another part of the warriors was captured alive.\u2026\u2026On the Warrior Planet, all of them were the same human being.Their strength was not strong either.The Great Desolate Army lost almost nothing.The second planet \u2013The low-level civilization of Slime planet was not so simple.At the very least, this was a relatively rare civilization, its strength was also stronger than the first warrior planet!When seeing a slime for the first time, the eyes of the people in the Transcendental Research Team and the Great Desolate Army were wide open.Some of them could not believe it!Appearing in plain sight, it was a jelly-like or semi-liquid-like monster.The appearance was very ugly and the face was also rather grim.Jiang Fan was also observing the Slimes, they were not cute.In addition, they were highly aggressive.As soon as the Great Desolate Army came in, they immediately lunged viciously.The Great Desolate Army, which had been refined by the warrior planet, did not panic.They set up a formation and the arrows were immediately shot out!For this expedition, no sound-absorbing arrows were brought!After all, the amount of vibranium was too small, it had to be sent out at a critical moment.However, what surprised the Great Desolate Army as well as the Transcendental Research Team was that on these soft-bodied monsters the arrows did not work.Even if it was a lance, after stabbing, it also slipped right off.The people of the Great Desolate Army were greatly alarmed!Fortunately, the Great Desolate Army had thick and large shields that blocked the way of these soft-bodied monsters.The Great Desolate Army was not lost.\u201cPhew.\u201dEveryone breathed a sigh of relief.To see all the extraordinary performance and characteristics of these soft-bodied monsters, the Great Desolate Army decided to temporarily build a temporary fortification.The Great Desolate Army began to test step by step.They attracted the soft monster to attack so that the extraordinary research team behind them could observe their various properties!The first character was easy to spot, the intelligence of these soft-bodied monsters was not high but it was not too low.The same tricks could not be reused like the warrior planet.To thoroughly understand all the properties of these soft monsters, the people of the Great Desolate Army had to stay there for a full month.There was an adventurous Slime, more than that, they were caught alive and placed in a cage as a research item!The Transcendental Research Team gathered around the cage, watched, and discussed them with interest.Taking advantage of this, the Transcendental Research Team roughly figured out Slime\u2019s bottom line.\u201cSlimes are sticky and are a type of soft-bodied creature.\u201dThe leader of the Transcendental Research Team, an elderly scholar who had won the Great Desolate Award, wrote down preliminary conclusions in his notebook.\u201cThe body is opaque or translucent.\u201d\u201cThe exterior color usually tends to match the local survival environment, similar to chameleons, and is more protective of itself.\u201d\u201cIt can change into various shapes.\u201d\u201cThey tend to crawl on the ground, the stone walls and the top.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cPreliminary they belong to omnivorous creatures.\u201d\u201cThere are different temperaments.\u201d\u201cSome are extremely vicious and extremely aggressive.\u201d\u201cSome are more gentle.\u201d\u201cThe attack is more powerful.\u201d\u201cBut the methods are simpler.\u201d\u201cDue to the softness of the body, it is flexible and can make jumping attacks.\u201d\u201cThe reproduction method is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSplit or Fusion!\u201d\u201cIts weakness is\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: Dangerous World! The Primal Sound!\u201cSlime\u2019s weakness is\u2026\u2026\u201dThe pen in the hand of the older scholar paused for a moment, then he continued: \u201cAfraid of salt and fire!\u201d\u201cEspecially afraid of salt and liquids containing salt!\u201dJust at the beginning, the Great Desolate Army could only take a defensive position.Later, they learned more and more about Slime, then the idea of attacking with salt suddenly came up.They were all slimy creatures, salt should also have an effect, right?As a result\u2026\u2026It surprised everyone!These seemingly terrifying and ugly supernatural creatures were really afraid of salt!Once they knew this, it would be easy.The team immediately formulated one type of brine after another.They experimented.At last, the most suitable formula was found.They just had to splash it on the Slimes and Slimes could be seriously injured very quickly.In the end, it was a transcendent creature, it wouldn\u2019t die that easily.To kill it completely, it must be ignited with fire.First, they needed to splash the prepared special saltwater then they had to use fire.Two steps, one down, no Slime could resist that!One month passed, more than 60 slimes on the slime planet were wiped out!Most of them were killed to make specimens.A small number were captured alive to bring them back to the Blue Star.\u201cThis species is essentially\u2026\u2026 also a soft-bodied creature.\u201dThe extraordinary research team finally concluded: \u201cIf there is no extraordinary energy on this planet, we will soon return to ordinary soft-bodied creatures!\u201d\u2026\u2026The Slime planet encounter, study, and the response of transcendental creatures was a pretty rare experience for the Great Desolate Army and the Transcendental Research Team.Everyone was starting to get the hang of it.All were aware, even if it was a transcendent creature.It also had its weaknesses; they just needed to look for it.There was a way to fight!Mentally, they were not so scared anymore.But\u2026\u2026There were also a small number of soldiers who had never been able to adapt in their hearts.It was like the symptoms of \u201cdeep sea phobia\u201d and \u201cdense object phobia\u201d.Some people were naturally more afraid of things like wild animals.For those soldiers.Qi made an immediate decision, he transferred directly out of the Great Desolate Army, he also selected new soldiers to come in.After the journey to the second planet was over.Enthusiasm was high throughout the Great Desolate Army!The Transcendental Research Team was also excited for the next journey.Inside the Imperial Palace, Qi was fully engaged in the development of gun powder at the same time.He did not forget to pay attention to the matter here.It was very eye-catching.Even at\u2026\u2026He was trying to ask Jiang Fan again but after thinking about it, he still gave up!\u2026\u2026After a month of recuperation, the third planet passage was opened!30,000 warriors of the Great Desolate Army and the Transcendental Research Team embarked on a new journey!This time, the Transcendental Research Team had expanded to fifteen people!The original ten people were indeed a little less.Qi was also sending extra manpower because the third planet was also a low-level civilization planet.Above the Planet, there lived a terrible and fierce beast \u2013Red Lion!It was said to be the blood descendant of a fierce beast of the advanced civilization planet \u2013 mythical beast!This was one of the most powerful planets in terms of strength.The situation of each planet.Jiang Fan did not inform Qi in advance about the situation of each planet.If Qi was informed in advance, it would reduce the value of the training!After the experience of the first few times, as soon as the Great Desolate Army stepped into the planet, they immediately took a defensive position.First, make a good fortification!Subsequently.Only then would the scouting team go out and carefully check out the situation!\u201cThis planet\u2026\u2026 Why does it give me a sense of danger? It\u2019s a little like the situation before I met a ferocious beast in the southern rainforest.\u201dA female scholar surveyed the planet\u2019s environment and said with some uneasiness.\u201cI\u2019m feeling this too.\u201dOthers also agreed.It was not just the research team, the soldiers of the Great Desolate Army who had a sharper sense of danger, all of them raised their alertness!Roar!This time, there was a huge beast roar in the distance!It could be heard far and wide!A few moments later, a few soldiers in charge of scouting scrambled back in a panic!There was a look of horror on their faces but what was surprising was this, no fierce beasts were chasing after them!Han, the leader of the Great Desolate Army, immediately sent people to pick up these soldiers.Wait for these soldiers to recover.Everyone asked.Only then did they find out.Several people encountered a tall, fierce beast that looked like a lion.The height was nearly three meters!The whole body was covered with thick crimson hair!There were also a pair of sharp fangs in the mouth!With one jump, it could easily cross the length of ten meters!What these soldiers encountered was a crimson beast that was dozing off and they awakened each other.Then they ran away in fear but what made them a little confused was that the beast just roared but it didn\u2019t chase after them!\u201cIt seems that the transcendent creature of this planet should be this crimson fierce beast.\u201dThe older scholar analyzed the experience from the previous planets.Let everyone understand that on this planet, the high probability was that there would be only one kind of transcendental creature.Like other plants and animals, they were also present but nothing special!This was also an innate limitation of the low-level civilization planets.Plus, there were not a lot of transcendental species on a planet without an owner.If it was an advanced civilization, then there could be far more than one kind of transcendental creature.\u201cThis beast may be different from the warriors or slimes we encountered before.\u201dThe old scholar glanced at everyone and said solemnly: \u201cSo\u2026\u2026 everyone must pay special attention.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of empiricism!\u201d\u201cFirst, let\u2019s figure out what this beast really is.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Unexpected Discovery! Strange Blood!With the awareness of the dangers that existed on this planet, everyone frowned for a while.It was completely different from the previous planets.The crimson beasts that existed here actually didn\u2019t take the initiative to attack!This made it very difficult for the Great Desolate Army.If they were allowed to go out and find it.I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u2026It would be dangerous.If there were too many people, the beast could escape.If there were too few people it was easy to be broken down individually.In addition, in the wild, it was the home field advantage of the beasts.Without the help of defensive fortifications, the Great Desolate Army could also face huge casualties!For the time being, no action was taken.They sat down and held a meeting for discussion.After some intense debate, finally\u2026\u2026A suggestion came from a scholar on beasts and it was accepted by most people.\u201cBeasts, especially large beasts like lions and tigers, generally have a strong sense of territory.\u201dThe scholar who studied beasts said: \u201cIn each area unless there is an unexpected situation, only one large beast exists!\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI guess the unknown crimson beast is here.\u201d\u201cIt should also have that nature.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it would be much easier.\u201dThe older scholar spoke up.\u201cThen let\u2019s start with a strategy based on that judgment.\u201dHan, who had been listening silently, made a decision, the Great Desolate Army immediately formed an elite squad.There were only a hundred of them but all of them were the elite of the elites.Each wore the most advanced bow and crossbow!This crossbow was the latest product of Tiangong Academy.Even without the use of sound-absorbing arrows, it also had a super high speed of over 120 meters per second!The scholar who studied the beasts gave a final warning and said, \u201cThe alertness of the beast is extremely high. I\u2019m afraid it can\u2019t be compared to the warriors or Slime from earlier.\u201d\u201cYou guys, be sure to be careful.\u201d\u2026\u2026The elite squad set off.With the disappearance of a hundred soldiers, everyone\u2019s hearts began to rise.After about an hour, the figure of the soldiers reappeared.This made everyone breathe a sigh of relief.One hundred people were back in one piece!The leader of the squad reported this discovery to the research team.\u201cThe crimson beast is less than a kilometer away from us.\u201dThe captain said quickly: \u201cIt lives in a cave.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same as what Fang Scholar said.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re within a five-kilometer radius.\u201d\u201cNone of the traces of other beasts were seen and the alertness is very high.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t get much closer.\u201d\u201cIt was found out.\u201d\u201cHowever, the weird thing is that \u00a0this crimson beast just walked out of the cave and glanced at us and then it went back again.\u201dAfter listening to the captain\u2019s statement, there was a strange look on everyone\u2019s face!This was indeed very strange!By the book, large beasts had a very strong sense of territory.Once there was a foreign invasion, they were bound to be attacked!Not to mention the little human beings.\u201cLet\u2019s study the strategy, and continue to send teams out to investigate tomorrow.\u201dThe old scholar said.\u2026\u2026Several days after that squad after the squad was sent out to investigate the habits and way of life of this crimson beast.The results were also passed one by one.The first was the distribution of beasts on this planet.There were 75 of them!There were both males and females, young and old.Adult male beasts had their separate turf.To everyone\u2019s surprise, the first crimson beast lacked aggression.It was not an exception, this was true of all crimson beasts.Although the planet had gradually lost its vitality, the number of plants and animals was very small.Food sources were lacking but some crimson beasts would rather starve than come out of their caves!\u201cWhat a strange habit.\u201dThe scholars were very puzzled!As the investigation progressed!The reason for this habit was also explored by everyone a little bit.\u201cSo, although this kind of beast is tall and mighty, it doesn\u2019t like moving?\u201dThe results of the survey also surprised everyone.\u201cThey liked to be alone in a cave?\u201d\u201cEven\u2026\u2026 able to stay out of action for a month?\u201dJiang Fan saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but think of another similar creature in his previous life-House man!After the basic habits were clarified, the next plan was ready.The Great Desolate Army began to hunt down the crimson beasts!Taking advantage of the fact that crimson beasts did not like to come out of their caves and the characteristics of low intelligence.They laid a trap outside the cave, then lure the crimson beast out!This crimson beast liked to be quiet and did not like to move but that didn\u2019t mean it was not offensive!After being provoked continuously, a roar of anger came from the caveThen it swooped out of the cave!Then\u2026\u2026It fell into a big hole in the ground!The crimson beast was very powerful.Defense, stamina, endurance, agility, etc. were all substantially more than the warriors and Slimes that they encountered before.But now they were trapped in the big hole plus the siege of so many soldiers!In the end, it still fell.Puff!A soldier stabbed his lance viciously into the weak spot of the crimson beast\u2019s body.A stream of blood spurted out and splashed on this soldier\u2019s hand!\u201cAhhh!\u201dThe soldier suddenly let out an extremely painful scream!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Two-pronged approach! The early debut of biological weapons!The screams of misery resounded through the sky and it was incredibly painful.Everyone else was taken aback.All of them turned around only to see the left hand of this soldier.The location where the blood of the crimson beast was splashed was seemed to have been splashed by sulfuric acid.At a speed visible to the naked eye, rapid ablation happened.They saw the white bones in an instant and the bone couldn\u2019t stop it.It even directly dissolved and soon, a crack sounded.His forearm broke directly but it was not over yet, even the upper arm started to melt rapidly!People who saw it were terrified!\u201cQuickly cut off his arm.\u201dA scholar who came with the team hurriedly shouted.The captain next to him also reacted and drew his long sword.With one slash, the soldier\u2019s arm was cut off!The soldier immediately fell unconscious.Affected by this unexpected event, everyone\u2019s mood was not too high.The group returned to the base camp and informed the others of the incident.After hearing about the blood of the crimson beast, the members of the research team looked surprised.\u201cIs the blood of this beast\u2026\u2026 poisonous?\u201dOne scholar speculated.\u201cMost likely.\u201dAnother scholar nodded in agreement.Even though it sounded unbelievable, this was a transcendent creature.Naturally, it was much more special than ordinary beasts.Soon. the crimson beast that had just been killed entered the dissection table.It\u2019s blood became the focus of research!After a little research, the research team initially figured out the situation.\u201cThe blood of the crimson beast is highly poisonous!\u201dThe old scholar performed the operation himself and then reported to Han: \u201cIts poison is far more terrifying than the poison of any creature we have ever seen.\u201d\u201cThis poison contains extremely strong solubility!\u201d\u201cInvestigate the cause.\u201d\u201cWe found it in the blood\u2026\u201d\u201cA special kind of energy.\u201d\u201cIt should be the transcendental energy of this planet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what makes the blood of the crimson beast so terribly poisonous!\u201dAfter hearing this, Han nodded slightly.He was currently the most accomplished person in Xia\u2019s medical field.He naturally understood these things.\u201cKeep researching for more discoveries.\u201dHan gave the order.In addition to the blood, the other parts of the body of the Crimson Lion were also quite special but they were without the special blood!After understanding the characteristics of the Crimson Lion, Han gave the order to harvest!The Great Desolate Army began to move and surrounded the Crimson Lions separately in each area!The wisdom of these crimson beasts was not very high.Naturally, they would not go to inform other companions or work together.It led to a smooth operation for the Great Desert Army.After three days on this planet, all the Crimson Lions were captured because the blood of the Crimson Lions was precious.So\u2026\u2026Han gave the order to try to capture it alive.Most of the Crimson Lions ended up being captured and transported back to Blue Star!\u2026\u2026The conquest of the three transcendent planets came to an end.Jiang Fan decided to let the Grand Desolate Army rest for three months.During this time, they could digest the previous things well.The Transcendental Research Team, on the other hand, was put into a busy research schedule as soon as they returned!In order to get the research results faster, Qi immediately upgraded the Transcendental Research Laboratory to the Transcendental Institute!That was the Xia Kingdom\u2019s first research institute!It was specially dedicated to study the transcendent creatures and some key elites were drawn from the two colleges and all over the kingdom to join the Transcendent Research Institute.With more people joining, research on the blood of the crimson lion was progressing rapidly.Soon, everyone found an unexpected result.That was\u2026\u2026This blood was not just effective for people but it was also effective against warriors and Slimes.\u201cCrimson Lion\u2019s blood is able to corrode and dissolve the transcendent energy possessed by other transcendent creatures, and even warriors and Slimes can\u2019t stop it.\u201dQi excitedly reported the result to Jiang Fan.\u201cSo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can make a whole new kind of weapon.\u201d\u201cBiological weapons.\u201dJiang Fan reminded him.Qi was stunned for a moment and then suddenly said: \u201cBiological weapons?! Yes, the wisdom of the Father is really\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dJiang Fan immediately interrupted Qi: \u201cContinue talking.\u201dQi took a deep breath and said, \u201cMy idea is to use the Crimson Lion\u2019s blood to make\u2026\u2026 biological weapons specifically for use against transcendents!\u201d\u201cIt works.\u201dJiang Fan left with two words.The teachings were becoming less and less.After Jiang Fan left.Qi slapped his head violently and said, \u201cBiological weapons? Why didn\u2019t I think of it, this\u2026\u2026 sounds like a very powerful thing.\u201dWith a hint from Jiang Fan, biological weapons were developed very late in his previous life!Subsequently, on the conquest of the outer planets, biological weapons would bring about an astonishing and terrifying impact!Meanwhile, another terrible weapon that does not belong to this era \u2014Gun powder was also a breakthrough!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Gun powder is introduced! The shock of Xia Kingdom!Gun powder\u2019s raw materials were not complicated.It was composed of saltpeter, carbon and sulfur in a certain ratio.But to make it into explosives was not that simple.In his previous life, it had developed for a long time.Until very much later.It was only then that the high-powered explosives were manufactured for use as conventional weapons.As for the reason\u2026\u2026The main problem was the ratio.Inside the Imperial Palace, next to the lab, it was all under siege.Near it was a deserted courtyard that was used as a test site!The first batch of finished gunpowder was shipped here.The eyes of everyone involved in the research were filled with anticipation and excitement!Today\u2026\u2026They might witness the birth of a terrible weapon!Jiang Fan was also watching silently.As the person who paid the most in research and development, Qi personally lit the fuse!A few moments later, a heaven-shaking sound like thunder sounded out of nowhere.It shook the sky!It could be heard far and wide!Those who were close, their ears were almost\u2026\u2026 Deafened by shock!Seeing this scene, Jiang Fan nodded slightly.This test was quite successful!It was not the perfect ratio but it was also lethal enough.The crowd was very excited, only Qi looked calm.He didn\u2019t seem to be satisfied yet.\u201cThe power that Father spoke of seems to be quite lacking?\u201dQi thought to himself.Up next, Qi did not relax his work on the improvement of gun powder.He continued to grasp it personally and in the midst of this test, Qi seemed to have caught a little inspiration.\u201cFather, I probably know what you mean by supersonic weapons.\u201dQi was alone and standing on a high platform, he was looking at the sky and was muttering.\u201cAt the moment of the explosion, the separation speed of the gun powder\u2019s particles\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it faster than the speed of sound?\u201d\u201cIf one can make the gunpowder smaller.\u201d\u201cAnd if the power remains the same.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a supersonic weapon?\u201dUnfortunately\u2026\u2026There was no response from Jiang Fan this time.Jiang Fan felt a little pity.Qi\u2019s talent was rare for a hundred years!In Jiang Fan\u2019s opinion, he was born in the wrong era.In this era, Xia Kingdom was still in the initial stage of technology!Many concepts and many disciplines were also not present.If Qi was born a hundred years later, a great scientist would appear in the future!Qi\u2019s improvement and research on gun powder and Jiang Fan\u2019s training program continued.He came to the Planet Association.Jiang Fan bought the passes for five transcendental planets in one go!These five planets were stronger than the last three.They were more difficult to deal with!\u2026\u2026Time rushed by and a year passed quickly.Above the Blue Star, everything was changing all the time!The gun powder research led by Qi was advancing little by little and the Great Desolate Army\u2019s planetary conquest was finally over.The Transcendental research team that followed the army increased to a team of fifty people and was subdivided into several teams to target all kinds of transcendental planets.During this one year of the conquest, on the next few stronger planets, the Great Desolate Army also began to suffer casualties but the gains far outweigh the losses!The momentum of the soldiers of the Great Desolate Army was becoming more and more formidable day by day.Facing transcendental beings they were not only afraid, their eyes even shone like a hungry wolf!The cavalry also came in handy.Paired with infantry.On certain occasions, it played an extremely important role!So far, the training of the low-level civilization planet came to an end.Next, it was the turn of the intermediate civilization planet and the advanced civilization planet!Jiang Fan didn\u2019t plan to train a lot in these two types of transcendental planets.After all\u2026\u2026The planets that most people awakened were low-level civilization planets!Intermediate and advanced were still in the minority.As for the intermediate civilization planets, Jiang Fan chose three of them.From advanced civilization planets, two were chosen.As for super civilizations? That won\u2019t be necessary.\u2026\u2026Time went on, another year passed.The Great Desolate Army had become more mature.Intermediate civilization planets and advanced civilization planets were not hard to beat!The role of the Transcendental Research Team in this was very big!Many seemingly tough opponents.It was all because the research team found a way.Some strange weapons were also invented!At night, in the imperial palace.On top of a high platform, Qi came here alone again and was looking at the sky.In these two years, Qi was exhausted.He was in charge of the research and development of gunpowder.He was also busy with the conquest affairs of the Great Desolate Army.It was obvious to the naked eye that he had aged a lot.The air swayed!Jiang Fan appeared.\u201cFather!\u201dQi was overjoyed.\u201cYou have some questions, right?\u201dJiang Fan formed the words with fireflies this time and said, \u201cIn these two years, why did I make you do so many things?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: The final revelation! The prologue of the Grand Competition!\u201cFather\u2026\u2026 seems to be preparing for something very important.\u201dQi expressed his thoughts.\u201cIt\u2019s not really important.\u201dJiang Fan continued to use fireflies to draw words.\u201cIt\u2019s about honor and rewards.\u201d\u201cCan I know?\u201dQi asked.Jiang Fan gently stroked one of the fireflies and said, \u201cThis is a competition between planet masters.\u201d\u201cMany planet masters are participating!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the life of every planet!\u201d\u201cThe winner\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWill win honor and awards.\u201d\u201cThe reason I have trained the Great Desolate Army continuously for the past two years is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIn order to win the contest.\u201dLooking at Jiang Fan\u2019s firefly text.Qi\u2019s eyes were pale but they were getting brighter!\u201cI understand! Father!\u201dQi knelt down on one knee and said solemnly, \u201cI know I\u2019m old, but I still have courage in my heart!\u201d\u201cPlease allow this battle of honor to be led by me personally!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dJiang Fan didn\u2019t have any consideration.He agreed to Qi\u2019s request.In Jiang Fan\u2019s opinion.Qi didn\u2019t have much time left.He didn\u2019t want to leave with regrets!\u2026\u2026Under the time flow rate specially set by Jiang Fan, two years in Blue Star were half a month outside.This day was the day of the big competition that Tong Zhen Sheng said.Jiang Fan got up early in the morning and had a simple breakfast, after that he headed for school.This world also had public transportation but Jiang Fan had been frugal since he was a child, there was no such thing as spare money.He had been running to and from school.He entered the school.On the side of the playground, Jiang Fan heard a cry.\u201cJiang Fan, over here.\u201dJiang Fan turned his head to look.He found out that it was a male classmate in the same class \u2013 Ma Songtao!Ma Songtao\u2019s last awakening was also good.Both parents were planet masters.The family was quite well off.Therefore\u2026\u2026This time, he was also selected for the five-person school team.Jiang Fan and Ma Songtao were not familiar with each other.They only knew each other.In fact, Jiang Fan didn\u2019t have much friendship with his classmates and next to Ma Songtao, there was another square-faced boy standing there.Jiang Fan did not recognize him but he knew that this was also one of the five selected.\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201dJiang Fan said hello.\u201cNo way.\u201dMa Songtao spread his hands and said, \u201cI heard that the leading teacher this time is Qiu Yunfei. If I\u2019m late, won\u2019t I be severely lectured?\u201d\u201cQiu Yunfei?\u201dJiang Fan did have some impression of this name.Speaking of which, another student came by but it was Xiang Junhao, who ranked third in the last awakening score!Xiang Junhao nodded slightly towards Jiang Fan and the others, then stepped aside.He did not participate in the chat.\u201cThis guy is really arrogant.\u201dMa Songtao muttered softly.\u201cTang Qingqing\u2019s awakening results are very high even in the entire River City. Coupled with the efforts of his family, it is said that the diameter of the planet is already close to 100 kilometers!\u201dThe square-faced boy said.\u201cAlmost 100 Kilometers? No wonder he\u2019s not with us.\u201dMa Songtao said.Immediately\u2026\u2026They seemed to realize something.After turning around, his eyes suddenly lit up.He tugged on Jiang Fan\u2019s clothes and said, \u201cLook, Tang Qingqing is here.\u201dJiang Fan and the square-faced boy also turned their heads.He saw a beautiful figure walking over.She was tall and slender and her looks were not bad.Not Tang Qingqing or who.Tang Qingqing walked up to the three of them.\u201cTang Qingqing, I heard that your planet has now exceeded 100 kilometers in diameter?\u201dMa Songtao asked.\u201cHmm.\u201dTang Qingqing gave a soft hmm.Her eyes stopped on Jiang Fan for a while.Then she calmly walked to the side.For Tang Qingqing, Jiang Fan had just awakened an ordinary planet.He was no longer the target she cared about!A few more minutes passed and a tall figure appeared and walked towards the five.This was a tall, middle-aged man with a cold face.\u201cTeacher Qiu!\u201dMa Songtao and the square-faced boy immediately shouted.Qiu Yunfei nodded slightly, glanced at the five Jiang Fan, and said loudly, \u201cThis time in the Jiangcheng competition, our school will be led by me!\u201d\u201cThe five of you are the best five in thousands of people in the seventh school, but\u2026\u2026\u201dQiu Yunfei\u2019s voice turned cold as she said, \u201cCompared to the geniuses in other schools, you \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not even close!\u201d\u201cThis time in the grand competition.\u201d\u201cAmong the five of you.\u201d\u201cOnly Tang Qingqing has a chance to qualify!\u201d\u201cThe rest of you \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHave no chance!\u201dAfter hearing, Xiang Junhao, Ma Songtao and the square-faced boy all three clenched their fists slightly, except for Jiang Fan.Their heart was not satisfied!Although Tang Qingqing was excellent.But why are they not the best students of No. 7 High School?Who would be willing to submit to others?Jiang Fan didn\u2019t care.He just wanted to hurry up and participate in the grand competition, quickly resolve the battle, get the reward.Then\u2026\u2026Go home and continue evolving the planet.In short\u2026\u2026Make it quick!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: A Gathering of Geniuses!Ma Songtao and Xiang Junhao all clenched their fists but no one dared to speak up in defense.Because\u2026\u2026This Qiu Yunfei was a fourth-level planet master like the principal Tong Zhensheng!Even in the entire Jiangcheng, he was also a famous powerhouse!\u201cI know you\u2019re not convinced.\u201dQiu Yunfei glanced at the five of them with cold and stern eyes, and said, \u201cBut\u2026 this is the truth!\u201d\u201cIf you want to be disobedient, speak with your strength!\u201d\u201cAlright, now\u2026\u2026 Follow me.\u201dAfter saying that, Qiu Yunfei took the lead, turned around and walked out of school.Jiang Fan and the others followed.The Seventh School naturally took the competition very seriously and they specially prepared a rune car!No one or thing was allowed to fly in Jiangcheng.A rune car from the rune planet of the intermediate civilization, due to the low price, it was convenient and fast, had become the most popular means of transportation.\u201cIt\u2019s fast, it\u2019s comfortable, and doesn\u2019t smell oily.\u201dJiang Fan felt something.It felt much more comfortable than the car in his previous life.\u2026\u2026The grand competition was held at the largest venue in Jiangcheng \u2013 Jiangcheng Center Stadium!Outside the venue, there were already media reporters who had arrived in advance but because the participants were all high school students, the competition banned all media access and interviews.The rune stopped outside the venue and Qiu Yunfei walked in with the five people.There was a staff at the door to check the identity, to prevent irrelevant people from sneaking in!After passing successfully.Qiu Yunfei glanced at the time, turned his head and said to the five people: \u201cThere is still some time before the opening of the grand competition. You can find a place to rest by yourself first.\u201dAfter saying that Qiu Yunfei walked straight to a lounge on the left.Jiang Fan and the other five were left behind.Tang Qingqing and Xiang Junhao each walked towards one side.The square-faced boy seemed to have met someone he knew and followed him to the other side.\u201cJiang Fan, let\u2019s go over there.\u201dMa Songtao pointed to a group of people not far away.They seemed to be students chosen from a high school!Among them, there were three girls.They were all young and beautiful!Three pairs of long legs.It was very eye-catching.Ma Songtao\u2019s eyes lit up.Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but complain.\u201cYou can go ahead, I\u2019ll find a place to sit.\u201dJiang Fan was not very interested.The venue was huge, there were lots of seats.Jiang Fan found a random place and sat down.\u201cAll right.\u201dMa Songtao could only follow Jiang Fan and sit down\u2026\u2026Inside the spacious lounge, there were many leading teachers from Jiangcheng Middle School and they were all chatting with each other.The arrival of Qiu Yunfei was welcomed.\u201cIt\u2019s Yun Fei.\u201d\u201cQiu Yunfei is here.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you would be leading the team at your school this time.\u201d\u201cCan we not pay attention to it? This year\u2019s class is full of geniuses, and even the city lord attaches great importance to it.\u201d\u2026\u2026A teacher came up to say hello and greeted each other.Qiu Yunfei nodded as a response.\u201cI heard that your school has produced an incredible genius this time, awakened a high-level energy planet and is expected to enter the top ten of this competition.\u201d A third middle school teacher who was familiar with Qiu Yunfei said.\u201cYou mean Tang Qingqing?\u201dQiu Yunfei\u2019s face was calm, and he said, \u201cHe does have hope of entering the top ten of the competition, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is the only one in our school who is expected to qualify.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your third middle school.\u201d\u201cThere are several main players.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid it can occupy several places in the top thirty-two.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dA teacher next to him interjected: \u201cEspecially Fang Zhenting of your third middle school. The planet that was awakened at the beginning was more than 30 kilometers and now it has crossed 100 kilometers. It is very possible to win the championship.\u201d\u201cWinning the championship? That\u2019s too exaggerated.\u201d\u201cAlthough Fang Zhenting is good, it\u2019s not his turn to win the championship.\u201d\u201cWith Fang Zhenting\u2019s strength, he is likely to be in the top three.

The strongest one!Following the direction of Ma Songtao\u2019s finger, Jiang Fan looked over and saw the genius of No. 2 Middle school.It was a tall boy and his face was quite mature.Surrounded by the people, he walked into the stadium at a long and fierce pace.\u201cLu Tao!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lu Tao from No. 2 Middle School!\u201d\u201cIs that the strongest student of No. 2 Middle School, the super genius with a planet diameter of 31.2 kilometers when he awakened?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s him! The top three contenders in this competition!\u201d\u2026\u2026With the appearance of the tall boy, a discussion erupted all around.Lu Tao ignored the people who were talking about it and went straight to the middle of the venue.There, a team from another school was standing.\u201cYou\u2019re here? Fang Zhenting.\u201dLu Tao looked at a tall and thin boy in the team and said.\u201cLu Tao, we stopped last time.\u201dFang Zhenting stared at Lu Tao, with a sharp light flashing in his eyes, and said, \u201cThis time\u2026\u2026 If you let me meet you, I will not be polite.\u201d\u201cYou can advance from the group first.\u201dLu Tao smiled and said, \u201cThis time\u2026\u2026 But every school\u2019s geniuses are here.\u201dWatching the conversation between the two, the others around were also whispering.\u201cThat person is\u2026\u2026 Fang Zhenting of the third middle school? The big favorite for the top three this time?\u201d\u201cI wonder who is stronger, him or Lu Tao?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, the diameter of Fang Zhenting\u2019s awakened planet is 31.3 kilometers, which is comparable to Lu Tao.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s said that Fang Zhenting and Lu Tao had sparred before. I wonder who will win and who will lose?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know of inside information, there is no clear winner between the two.\u201d\u2026\u2026Everyone was talking about it.There was another commotion at the entrance.Only to see\u2026\u2026A team in rather fancy uniforms walked in, headed by one person.A rather handsome boy immediately attracted the attention of many girls.\u201cIt\u2019s Wang Tianyi from Jin Yao Middle School.\u201d\u201cIs he Wang Tianyi, known as the Star of Jin Yao?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not just handsome, he\u2019s one of the five super-geniuses with a planet diameter of more than 30 kilometers at the time of awakening!\u201d\u201cFive super-geniuses? I only know Wang Tianyi and Lu Tao from No. 2 Middle School. Who are the other three?\u201d\u201cThe other three\u2026Fang Zhenting from No. 3 High School, the one from No. 1 High School, and a student from No. 7 High School.\u201d\u201cIn that case, we really have a lot of geniuses this time.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s more, there are not only five super-geniuses with a diameter of more than 30 kilometers, but also many top geniuses with a diameter of more than 25 kilometers.\u201d\u201cAccording to our teacher, this year\u2019s session\u2026\u2026 is the most talented and terrifying session in Jiangcheng\u2019s history!\u201dA skinny boy said.\u201cHiss\u2026\u2026\u201dA sound of breathing could be heard from the side.\u201cOtherwise, why would the city master value this competition so much and even add a reward.\u201dThe boy added.\u201cWith so many talents, I\u2019m afraid it will be difficult to even qualify.\u201dHearing the surrounding discussions, Ma Songtao couldn\u2019t help but sigh.This time, Qiu Yunfei walked out of the lounge.Ma Songtao hurriedly stood up.Jiang Fan also stood up calmly.Qiu Yunfei glanced at the two of them and asked, \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\u201cOver there.\u201dMa Songtao pointed to the side where Jun Hao and Tang Qingqing were.Qiu Yunfei turned his head to look over.When he saw a man beside Tang Qingqing, his face changed slightly.Immediately said: \u201cGo, call Xiang Junhao and the others, and come with me to welcome a distinguished guest.\u201d\u201cDistinguished guest?\u201dMa Songtao was unsure but he still followed the instructions.Jiang Fan naturally followed behind.At a corner of the venue, Tang Qingqing was standing with a man in his thirties.He was saying something.\u201cHahaha, what wind brought you to our Jiangcheng?\u201dBefore this man, Qiu Yunfei changed his usual coldness and greeted them warmly.\u201cQiu Yunfei, it\u2019s been a long time.\u201dThe man looked at Qiu Yunfei and said with a smile, \u201cI came to Jiangcheng this time on behalf of the school behind me, that is\u2026 the admissions teacher of our school in Dongyang Province this year is probably me.\u201dHearing the man\u2019s words, Qiu Yunfei\u2019s pupils shrank slightly and he laughed, \u201cWelcome, welcome.\u201dHe then introduced Jiang Fan and the others, \u201cThis is Tang Yushu, the teacher of Tianxing University. Maybe you will enter Tianxing University and study under him.\u201dTianxing University?!Ma Songtao and Xiang Junhao were all a little surprised.Star University was not simple, it was one of the thirty-two best colleges and universities in the country!To be a teacher in this kind of school.It must be at least a level 4 planet master or higher!\u201cThese people behind you should be the top performers in No. 7 High School.\u201dTang Yushu looked at Jiang Fan and the others with a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: No. player! Jiang Fan!\u201cIt\u2019s the students from our school who participated in this competition. They\u2019re not that talented.\u201dQiu Yunfei said quite modestly: \u201cIt can\u2019t be compared with other schools at all.\u201d\u201cThere are quite a few geniuses in Jiangcheng.\u201dTang Yushu nodded as well as Ma Songtao and the others behind.His gaze quickly scanned Tang Yushu and Tang Qingqing.Jiang Fan also saw it.There was quite a resemblance between the eyebrows of these two.They should be siblings or something!Qiu Yunfei was about to have a good chat with Tang Yushu.Suddenly!The whole venue went silent at once!Silence!There was silence!Qiu Yunfei and Tang Yushu subconsciously turned their heads.Jiang Fan also turned his head.Inside the venue, everyone turned their heads, only to see the entrance of the venue.A new team walked in, all of them were wearing neat white uniforms.Unlike other schools\u2019 teams.This team was confident and relaxed.There was no trace of nervousness and stage fright.In the middle of this team, a tall and slender girl walked in like a crane among chickens.White as snow.The temperament was cool.\u201cBu Jing Yue!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Bu Jing Yue of the No. 1 Middle school!\u201d\u201cShe\u2026\u2026 is the genius from No. 1 Middle School \u2013 Bu Jingyue? The undisputed champion of this competition?!\u201d\u201cThe only genius in Jiangcheng who has transformed the super energy aura and created an immortal civilization?\u201d\u201cOur teacher once commented that she is the strongest among the many super-geniuses in Jiangcheng\u2019s history!\u201d\u201cWith her around, there is really no suspense for the winner of this Grand Competition.\u201d\u201cEveryone else\u2026\u2026 At best, they will compete for second or third place!\u201d\u2026\u2026The voices of discussion sounded continuously around the venue.Listening to the chatter, Bu Jing Yue frowned slightly and led the way toward the interior of the venue.\u201cBrother, is this the only person you think I can\u2019t beat?\u201dTang Qingqing was also sizing up Bu Jing Yue.At this time she asked aloud.Tang Yushu, who was beside him, nodded and said, \u201cYes, except for her, you have a chance to win, but Bu Jing Yue\u2026\u2026 you are still far from her.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis time you\u2019re competing for second at best.\u201d\u201cOkay, Bu Jing Yue I\u2019m not an opponent for the time being, but for this second seat\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll fight!\u201dA hint of confidence flashed in Tang Qingqing\u2019s eyes.At the location of the No. 3 and No. 2 middle teams, a group of people was also witnessing the figure of Bu Jing Yue.\u201cIs Bu Jing Yue really that strong?\u201dSomeone asked.\u201cBu Jingyue has awakened a super civilization\u2014the planet of immortal cultivation! If there\u2019s no accident\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe winner of this Grand Competition is none other than her.\u201dLu Tao\u2019s face was gloomy.\u201cLu Tao, we can\u2019t earn the championship, so let\u2019s see who can enter the final.\u201dFang Zhenting said from the side.\u2026\u2026With the arrival of the last team, from the No. 1 middle school, this Jiangcheng Grand Competition also officially started!There were many teams.One by one, they entered the venue.Here was\u2026\u2026The waiting area for the competition.Qiu Yunfei and teachers from other schools led their own team, standing in the waiting area.Soon.The principal of each school also arrived in person.This was naturally because the city lord of Jiangcheng would come in person at the opening ceremony.The city lord of Jiangcheng was the ruler and the strongest person of Jiangcheng.Which principal would not dare to give him face?There was even a headmaster\u2026\u2026He rushed back with the rune car overnight!About ten minutes passed!A terrifying aura descended on the high platform ahead!Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.Looking up, he saw a tall and dignified man appearing above.According to the memory in his head, Jiang Fan knew this man with a terrifying aura.He was the city lord of Jiangcheng.The strongest person in Jiangcheng.A level 5 planet master!As the City Lord of Jiangcheng descended, the whole venue was silent!No one dared to make any noise!The city lord of Jiangcheng swept his gaze over everyone and said loudly: \u201cEveryone, you are all the best students in our Jiangcheng. This time, I hope you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo your best.\u201d\u201cLeave no regrets!\u201dThe city lord of Jiangcheng didn\u2019t say much.After one sentence, this short opening ceremony was then considered to be the end.Next \u2013The Grand competition officially started.Firstly\u2026\u2026The group draw was conducted!A total of 32 groups!According to the rules.There were 32 main players!Jiang Fan was listed as the No. 1 player!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Slaughter mode!In this great competition, more than 100 colleges and universities in Jiangcheng participated.The number of participants was 320!Not every school had the same number of participants.According to the rules, the combined results of each school from the previous five years of the Jiangcheng Grand combination will determine this year\u2019s quota!Five years ago, the school where Jiang Fan was.Jiangcheng No. 7 Middle School ranked in the top ten.Five seats were awarded.Jiangcheng No.1 Middle School was the fifth consecutive champion.Therefore, the maximum number of eight places was obtained.320 participating students were divided into thirty-two groups.Ten people in each group.In each group, a single cycle competition system was adopted.There was only one qualifying spot.It was very cruel!In order to keep the strength of each group consistent, they would not let the favorites meet early.Another player was set up in the competition!A total of 32 players were chosen according to the planet\u2019s diameter when awakened.The diameter of the planet at the time of Jiang Fan\u2019s awakening was 35.2 kilometers.He was the only student in Jiangcheng with a diameter of more than 35 kilometers and broke the historical record of Jiangcheng.There was no doubt about it.He was ranked as No. 1!Looking at Tong Zhensheng\u2019s smiling expression, Jiang Fan knew it.This\u2026\u2026That should be the reason why Jiang Fan only awakened an ordinary planet but Tong ZhenSheng still made the phone call himself.The main reason was for inviting him to the competition!This was the number one seed!In the previous competitions, almost all were swept up by the students of the No. 1 middle school.Either they fell into the hands of top middle schools such as No. 2, No. 3, or Jin Yao Middle School.It would be good if No.7 could drink soup.Now there was a chance to occupy this glory.Tong Zhensheng naturally won\u2019t miss it.The number 2 seed was naturally the record-breaking favorite to win the championship, Bu Jing Yue!\u2026\u2026Tang Qingqing ranked sixth.For the sixth seed.Looking at the top ten seeds, two from the No. 7 Middle School were on the list.Even the cold Qiu Yunfei had a smile on his face.On the projection in front of the venue, the names and schools of the thirty-two seeded players lined up one by one on top.Jiang Fan\u2019s name was at the top of the list, right above Bu JingyueMany people felt that it was a little dazzling!\u201cJiang Fan? The one who broke our Jiangcheng record during the previous awakening?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s him, but unfortunately\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard that there was an accident when this person transformed energy and what he finally created was just an ordinary planet.\u201d\u201cOrdinary planet? Impossible, the initial diameter of 35.2 kilometers and still not a Transcendent planet?\u201d\u201cThis matter is absolutely true. The teachers of our school have known leaders in the No. 7 school and they are sure that this is true.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s normal, maybe this Jiang Fan could also create a super-civilization planet.\u201d\u2026\u2026A lot of people at the bottom were talking secretly.Among the group of teachers, most of them already knew about this.Their expressions did not change much.Thirty-two seeded players were decided.The drawing of lots followed.The rules were also simple \u2013First, the strength of each group should be roughly equal.Second, students from the same school will not be drawn into a group.Every school had to send a teacher to pick them up.Soon.The results of the draw for the thirty-two groups were out!In the projection screen, a list of participants in each group one by one appeared on top.When he saw the others in the first group that Jiang Fan was in.Tong Zhensheng breathed a sigh of relief, looked at Jiang Fan and said, \u201cYour luck is good, this group is not very strong.\u201d\u201cGood luck.\u201dJiang Fan smiled faintly but Jiang Fan knew that this was not luck.Instead, \u2026\u2026The planet Jiang Fan awakened had the largest diameter.So, the diameter of other planets allocated later will be a little smaller.The draw was completed.The Grand competition officially started.Under the guidance of the staff, Jiang Fan walked to the battle room.Outside the battle room, teachers and leaders of each school could clearly see the battle through the projection above.\u201cIt seems that the overall strength of the first group is the weakest, but it is also the most chaotic. It is impossible to see who is most likely to qualify.\u201dOne teacher analyzed.\u201cIsn\u2019t there that record-breaking Jiang Fan? He should be relaxed and stress-free.\u201dAnother teacher who didn\u2019t know the inside story asked.\u201cHe awakened an ordinary planet, so it\u2019s going to be a bit hard.\u201dAnother teacher explained.\u201cHow can an ordinary planet fight against a Transcendent planet? This Jiang Fan might become the first in history, the number one seed in the team that couldn\u2019t even come out.\u201dA teacher from the No. 1 middle school said with a smile.\u201cLan Hao, you better take care of your No. 1 middle school.\u201dQiu Yunfei frowned and shouted.As always.Both the No. 1 and No. 7 middle schools were somewhat at odds.\u201chehe.\u201dThe teacher named Lan Hao of No. 1 Middle School was not angry, and smiled: \u201cThen we will wait and see.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: The first battle: Battlefield and slaughter of transcendent!Other teachers listened to the conversation between the two.There were no sockets but everyone knew that, this teacher named Lan Hao\u2019s words were harsh but it was the truth!They had been teachers for decades.Naturally, they had seen battles between ordinary and transcendent civilizations before.That scene\u2026\u2026Cruel was not enough to describe it.It was terrible!\u2026\u2026Outside the battle room, Jiang Fan walked over step by step and on the other side, Jiang Fan\u2019s opponent in his first battle.A tall and strong boy walked over under the guidance of the staff.Seeing Jiang Fan, the tall and strong boy grinned, revealing his white teeth and said, \u201cYou are the number one player Jiang Fan who broke the Jiangcheng record?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dJiang Fan watched him quietly.\u201cThe number one player is said to have never lost the first battle, this record\u2026\u2026 Today it will be me, Wang Teng, who will break it.\u201dThe tall boy said loudly.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the appearance of a great emperor.\u201dJiang Fan said indifferently and immediately entered the battle room.The tall and strong boy was baffled. He frowned slightly and said, \u201cWhen you lose, let\u2019s see if you can still laugh?\u201dInside the battle room, Jiang Fan sat on the chair.He began to enter the awakening space above the Blue Star and Qi was readyOutside the planet channel, there was an army of 100,000!Mighty!For this battle for the glory of the Father, Qi was fully prepared.An army of 100,000 was formed!Among them\u2026\u202650,000 was the regular troops.50,000 were reserves!Of the 50,000 regular troops, there were 30,000 people who were the main force of the Great Desolate Army!The formation of the army of 100,000 brought a considerable burden to the Xia Kingdom!One minister after another objected!Including the Minister of Household Affairs, the Minister of War and several cabinet ministers!Qi was ruthless in his determination.He took these opposition ministers directly and dismissed all of them!This also caused Qi to have a lot of curses on his back.But for the big competition this time, Qi endured it.At this time, Qi was standing on a high platform.He put on the general\u2019s armor again, put on his sword and stood on the high platform!Looking down at the army below.Pre-departure mobilization!\u201cThe warriors of the Xia Kingdom!\u201dQi\u2019s eyes swept past the army and he said loudly: \u201cToday\u2026\u2026 is the day of our battle for glory!\u201d\u201cDo you\u2026\u2026 have a good spear in your hand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe 100,000-strong army raised their spears and responded in unison.\u201cIs your blood hot?\u201dQi asked again.\u201cHot!\u201dThe voices of the soldiers were higher.The sound was high in the sky!The birds in the surrounding mountains and forests were frightened and fled.\u201cAre your hearts brave or not?\u201d\u201cBrave!\u201dThe rumbling sound pierced straight into the sky!With three questions, the moral of the army of 100,000 was completely stimulated!All of their faces were filled with excitement!Qi nodded in satisfaction.Although these words just now were old-fashioned, they were indeed quite effective!\u201cFight for the Xia Kingdom, fight for the glory, now\u2026\u2026 go!\u201dAt Jiang Fan\u2019s hint, Qi waved his hand.The door of the passage slowly opened and an army of 100,000 slowly entered but not everyone went in.As specified, the duration of the competition was ten hours.During these ten hours, passages could be opened at any time.However, other people\u2019s planets didn\u2019t have so many people like Jiang Fan\u2019s.There was no need for this.The opponent in the first battle was not strong.Therefore, Jiang Fan decided to send only 3,000 people to fight.If anything unexpected happened.Then\u2026\u2026It still would not be too late for the remaining Great Desolate Army to enter!The arena for the two sides to fight was located on a deserted planet.After the three thousand warriors of Great Desolate Army entered, they saw a huge opaque wall in the middle.It was the energy wall.It could isolate the vision of both sides.To prevent both sides from attacking before the competition starts.Along with the Great Desolate Army of 3,000.There was also a twenty-person transcendental research team.They\u2026\u2026They would stay on the battlefield.To provide real-time targeting solutions for the Great Desolate Army!With the breaking of the energy wall, the competition was officially started!Jiang Fan saw it at a glance.Opposite them was a group of burly martial artists!\u2026\u2026Within the observation room, there were many teachers who were paying attention to this competition.When seeing that\u2026\u2026Within the passage, when a group of soldiers came out one after another, the room was silent in an instant!All eyes were wide open.Feeling some disbelief!Just a moment ago, they were still discussing whether there would be at most eight hundred or a thousand people on the ordinary planet Jiang Fan had built!Seeing the result, this fact slapped their face!\u201cI\u2019m TM\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was the opponent, the tall boy.Seeing the black mass of 3,000 troops.He couldn\u2019t help but utter foul language.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Specially targeted! The Trinity of the Great Desolate Army!By the book, three thousand people was not much.But it depends on who you compare it with.Transcendents were inherently difficult to feed.Not to mention the planet that had just awakened only a month ago!Opponent Wang Teng built a martial artist planet.On the planet of Chinese martial arts, the number of martial artists was 108 in total.All of them had a good aura.Standing there, they were like 108 ancient beasts.But in front of the heavily armed Great Desolate Army of 3,000.Their momentum involuntarily decreased a little.\u201cAre those martial artists?\u201dQi glanced at it and immediately ordered: \u201cGet ready.\u201dThe Great Desolate Army had the most experience in facing martial artists.They immediately took action.In the front row was a huge shield.These shields were two meters high.It took two soldiers from the Great Desolate Army to lift one.The shields were then stuck into the mound of earth.Used to block the first wave of the martial artist\u2019s attack.Due to the limited iron ore in Blue Star, Qi had always been careful.Every piece of iron was used on the blade.These shields were all made of iron.Amazingly thick!Behind the shield formation, was a formation of spearsThese spears were not ordinary spears but specially made.Each one was over two meters!Seeing this scene, Jiang Fan nodded slightly.In his previous life, this formation was used to deal with the king of the feudal era \u2013 heavy cavalry!After the spear formation, it was a squad of numerous archers!Xia Kingdom\u2019s bow and arrow technology was at its peak.It had reached the point of no progress.Qi sat in the middle.Commanding from the center!Always ready to support or raid!\u2026\u2026Over time, in the middle of the field, the energy wall slowly disappeared.Competition\u2026\u2026Officially started!The tall and strong boy Wang Teng glanced at the lineup of the Great Desolate Army and shouted: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, there are many people on the opposite side, but\u2026 they are just a group of ordinary people, a group of soft sheep.\u201dUnlike Jiang Fan, other people had a transcendent planet.As a planet masters, they would all end up directly communicating with the transcendent beings on the planet.Some of them even claimed to be gods!After all\u2026\u2026For planet master, any life on the planet could be easily killed!This tall boy Wang Teng had established a sect.He was self-appointed as the Patriarch.108 martial artists also reacted, from the surprise just now.The big guy in the lead licked his lips and shouted: \u201cSect Master is right, these ordinary people are like sheep.\u201d\u201cIt looks like a lot, but in fact\u2026\u201d\u201cIf a tiger kills one, the other sheep will run away in fright.\u201d\u201cAnd we.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s 108 tigers!\u201d\u201cCharge!\u201d\u201cDirectly disperse these ordinary people!\u201dThe big man in the lead raised his machete and shouted.The voice fell.He took the lead and charged.Wang Teng and the leader of the big man\u2019s understanding was not wrong.There had been duels between ordinary and transcendent civilizations in the past!In fact, that\u2019s what happened.Ordinary people looked at the crowd but Transcendents charged.Most of the ordinary people were so frightened that they ran away in a panic.Hating their parents for giving birth to two less legs.It\u2019s just that\u2026\u2026Those were just ordinary people and the Great Desolate Army here was a regular army that had fought hundreds of battles!There had never been an ordinary planet before.That could be like Blue Star.With so many people.Naturally, they couldn\u2019t afford to form an army!The speed of the martial artists was quite fast.In the blink of an eye, they crossed a large distance.There was no hint of panic in the Great Desolate Army.The sound of arrows breaking through the air sounded.Arrows rained down.Keep rushing towards these martial artists!Tho!Tho!Tho!\u2026\u2026The fierce martial artists kept advancing while fending off these arrows.\u201cGet ready!\u201dA general watched this scene indifferently, and immediately raised his right hand!Behind him, a team of archers picked up the arrows in their hands.This archery team was divided into small teams of three.Specially used to deal against martial artists.The martial artist\u2019s jumping ability was very strong.One step could reach nearly ten meters and just as these martial artists took off into the air, they hadn\u2019t even landed yet.The arrows in the archery team\u2019s hand shot out.The three-person team each targeted the same martial artist.But the specific parts were different!Aimed at the top, middle and bottom respectively!The martial artist was completely sealed off.The martial artists in mid-air were unable to move around.They could only use a knife to block it!This way, more flaws were revealed!\u201cAhhh!\u201dA scream sounded.A martial artist who jumped in mid-air was directly shot in the leg by an arrow.It fell from the air.Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh\u2026\u2026From the archery team.One after another, an endless stream of arrows came out!Aimed specifically at those martial artists who jumped into mid-air!As for the other archers.They covered the whole area.No room for martial artists to dodge!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext

The first battle is a success!Swish!Swish!Swish!\u2026\u2026A rain of arrows poured down like locusts passing through.It was all over the place!Among the densely packed arrows, the 108 martial artists first sneered and blocked with their blades!But with the passage of time, each of these martial artists\u2019 hands was getting sore.This time\u2026\u2026 There was no end to it!Arrows were completely non-stop!Qi made preparations during these years.It was revealed at this time.The Xia Kingdom had built an unknown number of crossbows and arrows!At this moment, it was impossible for martial artists to get close!The three-man hunting team was firing at the same time!\u201cAhh.\u201dThere was another scream.A tall and sturdy martial artist fell from mid-air.Tightly holding his right leg!Upper, middle and bottom\u2026\u2026The bottom was the most difficult to defend.In addition, the arrows from the three-man team were extremely tricky.If one of these martial artists was not careful.It\u2019ll get shot!\u201cAhhh!\u201d\u201cAhhh!\u201dTwo more screams.The two martial artists who were closer fell in response to the sound.One arrow was in the thigh and another arrow was in the abdomen!Such injuries were not considered fatal for martial artists.However, it was impossible to continue fighting in a short period of time.Such a three-person team was the bow and arrow combination researched by the Transcendental Research Group, specifically designed to target martial artists!It looked simple but the cooperation and tacit understanding among them was been years of hard work!Gradually, as the martial artist\u2019s stamina and concentration decreased, the screams grew more and more, one after another!At this time, the big man at the front line was not even close to the huge shield formation yet!The remaining martial artists could not help but feel a trace of fear and did not dare to move forward.\u201cTrash, a bunch of trash.\u201dSeeing this scene, the tall and strong boy Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but curse, \u201cThose are all ordinary people, what are you doing? Why are you being fucked so badly by a group of ordinary people!\u201d\u201cCharge!\u201d\u201cAttack for me!\u201d\u201cCharge over, charge into their army.\u201d\u201cTigers enter the flock of sheep!\u201d\u201cWhat follows is a one-sided slaughter.\u201dWang Teng shouted with anger!Affected by this, the remaining martial artists also regained some of their courage.They screamed and kept rushing up but the mind was in disarray.Not to mention the formation was as if a vicious dog was pouncing on food.A swarm of people!\u201cFree-fire!\u201dSeeing these chaotic martial artists, who actually rushed towards the shield formation.The general in command gave a direct order.Free-fire\u2026\u2026That was, every archer no longer cooperates.See the opportunity for yourself.Hit the enemy with precision and deadly strikes!Instantly, a stream of arrows, like a life-threatening rope, pouncing on one headless martial artist after another!Aimed at the weak points of their insteps, thighs and heads, under the dense rain of arrows, no martial artist could survive\u2026\u2026This seemingly short but unreachable journey!Screams resounded one after another!Just for a moment, on the ground, there were a dozen more martial artists who were hit by arrows.Finally\u2026\u2026The remaining martial artists were afraid.Facing the 3,000 troops of the Great Desolate Army, a look of fear appeared on their face.A martial artist shouted.Followed by\u2026\u2026Turned around and ran away frantically.The other martial artists seemed to have been infected.They also ran away.Only the first few people were left behind!\u201cShoot him!\u201dQi himself gave the order.He pointed at the burly man with the knife.Immediately, almost all of the arrows were aimed at this big man.Thousands of arrows pounced one after another!Even if this big man was the strongest of all martial artists, he couldn\u2019t resist either.In the eyes of horror, the big man with the knife was shot into a hornet\u2019s nest!The rest of the martial artists were horrified!There was no more hesitation.They turned around and ran away!Seeing this scene, Wang Teng\u2019s hands in the battle room were trembling slightly.The man with the knife was the one he was trying his best to nurture.He was one of the most talented martial artists.Now\u2026\u2026He actually died on the battlefield!\u201cAll troops in pursuit!\u201dQi waved his long sword and pointed forward.The shield formation, spear formation and archery formation slowly moved forward, approaching the martial artists!Because this was the arena, the space was limited.With such a slow pace could also catch up with agile martial artists.The martial artists at this time were shrinking in the other corner of the battlefield like quails.Trembling!After the Great Desolate Army approached, another round of arrows rained down.These martial artists had no room to retreat.They totally became a live target.There were continuous screams.Martial artists were constantly being shot into hedgehogs!\u201cSurrender!\u201d\u201cI surrender!\u201dIn the battle room, no matter how unwilling, Wang Teng still helplessly raised his hand!No more surrendering.He had painstakingly trained these martial artists.They were going to be shot to death!The referee next to him\u2014\u2014A level two planet master immediately terminated the game.A white flag appeared in the sky above the battlefield of the martial artist.Announcing the end of the game!First battle\u2026\u2026The Great Desolate Army won the victory step by step!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: The Gollum Monster! Five consecutive victories!\u201cRetreat!\u201dQi waved his hand and shouted.The Great Desolate Army slowly retreated.Even though victorious, there was no disorder either.Facing this first victory, there was no excitement and thrill for the Great Desolate Army.Today\u2019s opponent was not much stronger as compared with those transcendent species of previous alien conquests\u2026\u2026In addition, it was still the most researched martial artist!It would be weird not to get it!\u2026\u2026Inside the viewing room, both Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei breathed a sigh of relief.Five participating students from Jiangcheng No. 7 Middle School.In the first battle, the other four had weaker opponents.Only for Jiang Fan\u2026\u2026The uncertainty was great.Both watched in person here.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dTong Zhensheng sighed and said, \u201cJiang Fan\u2019s awakened planet is big and there are many ordinary people. In the next game, he should be able to get a lot of victories.\u201dQiu Yunfei, who was next to him, nodded.In the eyes of two people, it was natural to see that.This army of ordinary people built by Jiang Fan was well equipped and was not weak.It could get out of the line was another story but a few more victories shouldn\u2019t be a problem.After the first round, they naturally need rest.Such a competition, if placed in reality, one game a day was the limit but this way the Grand competition would probably take half a month!So\u2026\u2026As specified, each participating planet master accelerated the flow of time a little.About an hour in the real world and three days on the planet.Of course, each planet owner could decide its own acceleration ratio.Jiang Fan did not change.After one match, rest for three days, the rhythm was just right.One hour later, the second match started and on the Blue Star, it was three days later.After three days of recuperation, the Great Desolate Army once again stepped out of the passage in high spirits to meet the second opponent!This second opponent was also a martial planet but as compared to the first opponent, it was just a low level martial arts civilization.The strength was quite weak.The first group Jiang Fan was in, half of the participating students were martial artists\u2019 civilization planets.The Great Desolate Army had an even easier battle, defeating their opponents without much effort!The third battle was with a planet of astral energy.It was roughly not very different from the martial artists.It was also unable to beat the Great Desolate Army.The Great Desolate Army had a total of 30,000 people.Divided into ten teams!Every match.A new team would appear in each match so that each team could be refined!Fourth battle.Fifth battle.The opponents were not even strong.After seeing the performance of the Great Desolate Army, these two opponents surrendered just after a little resistance.Just like what the outside world had said, Jiang Fan\u2019s group didn\u2019t have any popular players.In the sixth battle\u2026\u2026The Great Desolate Army met a tricky opponent!This was an alien beast civilization planet!So-called exotic beasts\u2026\u2026Were just uncommon transcendental monsters!Like the Slimes encountered in the previous training of the Great Desolate Army.It could be called a beast.The extraordinary species of this beast planet was an ugly creature called \u201cGollum Monster\u201d.Their physical strength was not strong but they had strong spiritual power and they were able to talk.They could confuse people with words.Many soldiers of the Great Desolate Army were caught off guard.They were actually controlled by this Gollum.Instead, they turned their heads and attacked their comrades!Fortunately, the teammates around them found out in time and immediately stopped their actions.This caused no casualties.Gollum monsters could also drill holes in the ground.They usually stayed in the cave.Only occasionally did a head come out.It was hard to defend!Therefore, the Great Desolate Army did not dare to act rashly.Fortunately, there was the Transcendental research team.After a series of trials and observations.Soon, there was a team member, who discovered the fatal weakness of the Gollums!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Fatal weakness! The biggest dark horse!This fatal weakness of the Gollum monster was discovered by accident.It was\u2026\u2026Greed!Extreme greed!They were even more greedy than the legendary dragons!Once they would see the shiny gems or gold coins, these Gollum monsters wouldn\u2019t walk away.For a piece of gold, they would even fight with their own companions!Taking advantage of this, Qi rushed to transport a batch of yellow and orange-gold coins and crystal clear gems from the Xia Kingdom\u2019s Treasury and threw it to the opposite field with a stone thrower.Next, let the Great Desolate Army retreat some distance.Sit back and wait for these Gollum monsters to fight.As expected, there was no external threat.These Gollum monsters\u2019 sanity was completely outmatched by their nature!They crawled out of the cave and bounced straight on the gold coins and gems on the ground.The Great Desolate Army was also based on the number of heads of Gollum monsters.They controlled the number of gems and gold coins.Some of the Gollum monsters who didn\u2019t grab it had the coveted look.Soon, they started to fight!One member of the transcendental team came up with an even better idea.Just let the archer hang the gold coins on the arrows, then shoot it out.Surprisingly, these Gollum monsters didn\u2019t dodge at all.Instead, they used their hands to try to pick off the gold coins from the arrows.Even though several Gollum monsters got shot.The other Gollum monsters also remained the same.The opponent in this battle was the first to suffer.He surrendered directly!For one gold coin, the battlefield was full of foolishness.It was really too humiliating.This TM\u2026\u2026 who could stand it.But there was no way around it.Who told him that the initial energy he transformed was the most suitable for cultivating these greedy monsters.\u2026\u2026Of the first six matches, these Gollum Monsters were the trickiest of all.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that a scholar had discovered the weakness of the Gollum monster, the Great Desolate Army would probably have to pay a heavy price.To be able to defeat these ugly monsters, after this battle, Qi also paid more attention to the Transcendental Research team.He decided to add more scholars in the next match.After three days of rest, the seventh match of the group stage continued.The opponent\u2019s strength was not strong, and it was a low-level civilization planet.Transcendental species were also common on the planet.It brought no trouble at all.The Great Desolate Army won easily!The eighth match was a crucial match!The opponent\u2019s strength was stronger than before.But in front of the well-prepared Great Desolate Army, there was still not much resistance.It took less than half an hour and the opponent surrendered!So far, in the first eight matches, the Great Desolate Army surprised everyone.With eight consecutive wins, they had the initiative to qualify!In the first group, a dark horse suddenly appeared.An unknown male student actually also won the first eight matches and became the biggest dark horse of the big competition!Exactly the same as Jiang Fan\u2019s battle record!The last match was between Jiang Fan and this dark horse.Whoever won, would get the only qualifying spot!Jiang Fan had not been idle during this time.The strength of the Great Desolate Army was crushing but Jiang Fan was not careless.He collected videos of one opponent after another.Using light projection, it was transmitted to Qi on the Blue Star.Qi was also very serious.During the rest time, he was leading the Transcendental Research team to watch these videos over and over again.At the same time, matches of other groups were also almost near the end.The situation of many groups was already very clear.Not as big as the first group to watch.\u2026\u2026Near the end of the afternoon.The ninth match was the last game officially started.Inside the viewing room.There were a lot more teachers gathered around.Everyone was concerned about who could get the only qualifying spot in the match between Jiang Fan and this big dark horse!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: The battle for the top spot in the group! Serpent Planet!Unlike before, this time, all the teachers put away their contempt for Jiang Fan.They began to discuss seriously.\u201cThis student named Fang Yan, whose awakening diameter is less than 25 kilometers, can actually create such a powerful race. I am very optimistic about him.\u201d A teacher said.Many teachers nodded in agreement because there were already eight games ahead.Everyone knew the situation of the planet of the biggest dark horse \u201cFang Yan\u201d, he had an intermediate civilization!He was still cultivating an intermediate civilization, an extremely rare and powerful race \u2013The Serpents!It impressed many people.Of course, there were also people who were optimistic about Jiang Fan.Inside the viewing room, Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei were already standing, waiting for the match to start.At the same time, the situation of the other four students of Jiangcheng No. 7 Middle School had basically settled!Tang Qingqing was ranked sixth, in her groupShe was standing out, her strength crushed the crowd.She quickly won nine games in a row and easily got the qualifying spot.As for the average strength of Ma Songtao and the square-faced boy, they won less and lost more in the group.They had been eliminated early.Jun Hao whose diameter of the Awakened Planet was similar to Tang Qingqing\u2019s was not so lucky and was classified as a recognized death team.In the beginning, it was also smooth sailing, singing high.The first six games were all wins but in the seventh and eighth match.He consecutively lost to the two geniuses of No. 1 Middle School and Jin Yao Middle School!In this way, they lost their chance to qualify.Now\u2026\u2026The only hope that remained was on Jiang Fan.\u2026\u2026Outside the battle room, Jiang Fan met Fang Yan, the big dark horse in the same group \u2013A skinny guy!Fang Yan just glanced at Jiang Fan.There was a hint of arrogance in his eyes.He went straight into the battle room.Jiang Fan smiled slightly.It was not taken to heart.\u201cSo what if the awakened planet is of average diameter?\u201dFang Yan sat on the chair in the battle room, clenched his fists slightly, and thought to himself, \u201cI, Fang Yan can still create a powerful civilization!\u201d\u201cQualifying from the group is just the beginning.\u201d\u201cMy goal\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs the winner of this Grand Competition!\u201dFang Yan\u2019s eyes showed a trace of pride and confidence!On Jiang Fan\u2019s side, he did not think too much.All attention was placed on the Great Desolate Army who was about to enter the arena.This time the opponent\u2019s match video, Jiang Fan also sent it to Qi.Because the opponent was not easy.Qi had only three consecutive days.He was discussing strategies with the research team!Soon.Passage opened.The Great Desolate Army entered the arena with ease and familiarity.The competition followed\u2026\u2026Officially started!The venue for this competition was a desert.Jiang Fan was a little surprised when he saw that.The venue was immediately drawn.Jiang Fan could only lament that the other party\u2019s luck was really good.Because\u2026\u2026Desert terrain was very favorable for the Serpents!It could be said that it was a natural home for them!On soft sand, it was difficult for unusual creatures to walk.But for the serpents, it was smoother than flat ground.When a giant snake man with a giant snake tail, a human head and a snake body appeared in the desert, the faces of Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei in the viewing room couldn\u2019t help but change slightly!\u201cIt turned out to be desert terrain?!\u201d\u201cJiang Fan is in trouble now. The strength of the serpents in the desert should at least\u2026\u2026 be increased by two folds!\u201d\u201cThis battle\u2026\u2026 is difficult!\u201dThere was a lot of talk among the teachers.Jiang Fan was also observing these serpents.Their body shape was huge.It was up to three meters or more!The surface was covered with thick blue-black scales!Under the glow of light, there was a hint of danger.A long snake letter spited out from their mouth.It was intimidating!The number was even greater.With a glance over, there were around three hundred heads.This was also since the group fought.One of the most numerous and strongest opponents that the Great Desolate Army had encountered!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Powerful Serpents! Xia Kingdom\u2019s big killer!Jiang Fan\u2019s estimation was not wrong.The number of Serpents was exactly 300.A lot of them had just awakened a month ago.There were so many transcendent beings.It could be said that it was extremely rare!On the Great Desolate Army\u2019s side, Qi\u2019s face was obviously a lot more dignified than usual.Qi did not dare to be careless in this battle.The number of the Great Desolate Army was directly increased to five thousand.Followed by a fifty-member transcendental research team, both sides were in the desert.Each set up their own formation!Unlike the previous opponents, the Serpents were born warriors.They didn\u2019t require much training.Naturally, they knew how to cooperate and battle in the formation!Not the least bit messy, a giant snake man with a human head and a snake body also held a huge bone trident in his hands!The Transcendental Research Team observed for a moment.Judged.These tridents should be\u2026\u2026Made from the bones of other large creatures on the Serpent Planet.It also seems to have a trace of transcendent\u2019s aura.No ordinary beast bones could be compared.A huge body of up to three meters tall plus the giant trident that was almost as tall as the snake\u2019s body!The oppression given to the Great Desolate Army was unprecedented!The Great Desolate Army followed the previous way of fighting.Foremost was\u2026\u2026Giant shield formation!Behind it was the spear formation!After the spear formation, it was the largest number of archers.This was also the main killing power!\u201cThere are actually weapons!\u201dQi frowned slightly.A group of scholars from the Transcendental Research Group also frowned one by one.\u201cWarriors of the Serpents.\u201dFang Yan\u2019s voice rang out over the giant snake men, saying, \u201cKill them! Smash these weak mole ants!\u201dOn this serpent planet, Fang Yan directly transformed into a god, guiding the growth and cultivation of all the serpents from above!The Serpent was another race that worshiped gods.Fang Yan\u2019s order was very compliant!Immediately, a giant serpent man who was dragging his huge snake tail, glided quickly across the sand!The sandy surface was soft enough to trap an ordinary person.The snake man walked on it.Yet it was easier than flat ground.\u201cRelease the arrows!\u201dQi personally commanded.Arrows shot out in an instant!Flying towards the fast-approaching giant snake man.A team of 3,000 archers collectively fired a rain of arrows.All the enemies fell like locusts, in the previous eight matches.That was the most famous killing move of the Great Desolate Army!Many teachers were a little stunned by this!However, faced with this terrible rain of arrows.These huge snake men were not anxious.They stopped moving forward.Then they lowered their head.The snake\u2019s head and the thick blue-black scales on its back were exposed!Clang!Clang!Clang!\u2026\u2026Arrows shot on these blue-black scales made a crisp sound!But it didn\u2019t hurt the scales half a point!Due to the smoothness of the scales, some of the arrows just slid away.A round of arrows came down.Three thousand arrows were blocked by the thick blue-black scales on the back of the snake man!Not a single snake was injured or killed.\u201cAgainst your greatest killer, how could I be unprepared?\u201dInside the viewing room.Seeing this scene, Fang Yan sneered: \u201cThe scale armor of the snake people is one of their greatest talents!\u201d\u201cWith these ordinary arrows\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even think about breaking the defense!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cArrows\u2026\u2026 ineffective!\u201dAfter seeing the snake man\u2019s perverted scale armor, Qi immediately made a judgment.With such a perverted defense, it was impossible to take advantage of the number of arrows.Ordinary arrows shot through.It was like a toothpick stabbing a steel plate!No matter how many were shot, none of them worked.It was the first time that unbeatable arrow rain attack lost effect!But\u2026\u2026There was no panic in Qi\u2019s heart.Arrow Rain Attack!It was also just one of the most common and conventional tactics of the Great Desolate Army!The trump card of the Great Desolate Army was not quite issued yet!\u201cWe have to use the big killer!\u201dQi\u2019s gaze was slightly fixed.The decision was made in an instant!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Amazing killer! The talent of the snake man!Jiang Fan watched all the videos of Fang Yan\u2019s previous eight matches.He then conveyed everything to Qi by projection.Qi and the people in the research team studied it for unknown times.For the characteristics of the Serpents, various strategies were developed.The snake people\u2019s perverted back scales.It was within Qi\u2019s expectation.\u201cPrepare the crossbow!\u201dQi waved his hand.At the very back of the Great Desolate Army.Ten big structures covered in cloth revealed their faces!This\u2026\u2026There were ten large crossbows!In Jiang Fan\u2019s previous life, the crossbow was in the age of cold weapons.It was a super-enhanced version of the normal bow.Its power was immense.A crossbow was able to span distances of hundreds of meters.It was then nailed into the thick wall.These were the Xia Kingdom\u2019s crossbows.The craftsmanship was more mature than in his previous life.It had more power and had more range!Each crossbow could be manipulated with as few as twenty soldiers.On top of the crossbows, the arrows were already filled.These arrows were thicker than the spears of ordinary soldiers.All around, the archery team\u2019s arrow rain attack didn\u2019t stop there.The main purpose was to cover the firing of the crossbow.They didn\u2019t let their opponent find out in advance.Dang! Dang! Dang!\u2026\u2026The sound of arrows falling on the blue-black scales kept ringing.After the snake people gradually get used to the arrow rain of this intensity.Fang Yan shouted: \u201cSnake warriors, go ahead and kill the opposite side!\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dThe leader of the Snake-People Tribe shouted.Immediately, the entire snake people race was boiling with enthusiasm!As they came forward, Qi seized the opportunity and shouted loudly, \u201cFire!\u201dIn an instant, arrows on top of ten crossbows launched in unison.They were shooting directly at the tall snake people in the front!On a wide battlefield, the lethality of the crossbow was actually limited.But\u2026\u2026On this small battlefield, the Serpents were in dense formation.Plus there was no defense.Feeling a huge cracking sound, the snake head directly bent and used the thick scales on the back to resist!Swish!A huge crossbow\u2019s arrow broke through the air and shot right in the back of a giant snake man!There was only a \u201cpoof\u201d sound.The blue-black scales of the snake man were ripped straight open!The huge crossbow arrow penetrated the entire body of the snake man!Even that huge force took this snake man and flew backward.It pounced the snake man in the back really hard.The two snake people couldn\u2019t help rolling into a ball!As for the other nine crossbow\u2019s arrows, half of them fell short and half of them landed precisely on the snake-men.The entire thick scales and snake body of snake people were torn apart!There was a hoarse scream.Seeing this horrible scene, other snake people who were still advancing, stopped in unison.A hint of fear appeared in their eyes.\u201cIt worked.\u201dQi, on the other hand, breathed a sigh of relief!Not to be outdone by this force, he had been insisting on building such a large-scale destruction weapon that could not see any use at the beginning!\u201cHoly shit\u2026\u2026 What kind of weapon is this?\u201d\u201cSo much power?!\u201d\u201cActually, it can\u2019t be stopped by a snake man with a strong physical body?\u201dInside the viewing room, the teachers were also surprised.Most of what they saw in the past was a showdown between transcendents.Weapons were also relatively monotonous.They had never seen such a large crossbow.Fang Yan in the sparring room clenched his teeth and stared deadly at the crossbows in the Great Desolate Army\u2019s formation.\u201cThere is still such a trump card hidden.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI also have trump cards!\u201d\u201cSerpent warriors!\u201d\u201cThere is no need to fear!\u201d\u201cUse your innate divine ability to destroy your opponents!\u201dFang Yan\u2019s voice resounded in the sky above the Serpents.The look of fear in the eyes of the serpents gradually dissipated.Followed by a few of the largest of these snake men, the pupil inside their snake\u2019s eye, \u00a0gradually turned into a thin line.Within the thin line, there seemed to be some terrifying fluctuations coming out!The soldiers of the Great Desolate Army looked suspiciously at this move of the snake people.Suddenly\u2026\u2026In the next moment, in the forefront, the body actually stiffened little by little of the soldiers behind the shield formation.The whole person stood there like a stone, unable to move at all!That tall and mighty soldier suddenly stiffened from the feet to the head.The skin of the body became like a layer of lime.It became gray!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

King\u2019s research team!\u201cPetrification?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a petrification technique!\u201d\u201cA snake person of a first-class planet is able to awaken such a natural divine ability!?\u201d\u2026\u2026Inside the viewing room, every teacher felt that it was unbelievable.The reason why serpents were recognized as a powerful race in the intermediate civilization was the terrifying talent of \u201cpetrification\u201d!It was able to ignore almost any defense.Furthermore, it could even cross levels.Let the opponent who sees the eyes of the snake man\u2026\u2026Directly petrified!In the previous competition, there was a snake-human race cultivated by a talented student.One of the leaders took advantage of this magical power and a single snake took the opponent\u2014An advanced civilization was petrified.It was shocking!Today, everyone saw this race again.\u201cFortunately.\u201dTong Zhen Sheng\u2019s slightly discolored face said with a hint of gratitude, \u201cThere are only a few snake people who have awakened this divine ability!\u201dOne successful awakening was scary enough.If there were three hundred snake people on the battlefield and all had petrification, then there was no need to play this game.Not to mention the 5,000 troops of the Great Desolate Army.Even if this amount was doubled tenfold, it would still be all petrified!\u2026\u2026On the side of the Great Desolate Army, the soldiers at the forefront were being petrified and solidified.The soldiers in the back.They looked at the changes in their comrades in front of them.Couldn\u2019t help but be a little confused!Faced with this bizarre scene, the Transcendental Research team in the back was also stunned.This was the first time that the snake people had shown this trump card in the competition.Naturally, there was no previous video.A female scholar picked up the binoculars.She wanted to see what was going on.A few moments later, her whole body stiffened.Same as the soldiers in the front.A grayish-white color rose from the soles of her feet!\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u2026 Look at the eyes\u2026\u2026\u201dThis female scholar only said these few words and the whole body was petrified!Everyone was shocked.\u201cEyes, it\u2019s their eyes!\u201dA male scholar specializing in transcendental animals immediately reacted and sharply said, \u201cGive the order, don\u2019t look at the eyes of these snake people!\u201dQi was not far from here.Naturally, he heard this.After a slight daze, he couldn\u2019t figure out why, but still, he immediately shouted, \u201cKeep your heads down, all of you!\u201dThe Great Desolate Army took obedience as its duty.In an instant, all of them lowered their heads.This included members of the Transcendental Research team.After lowering their heads, everyone was surprised to find out.All around this bizarre petrification phenomenon, there was no continuation.This time, the male scholar just explained quickly: \u201cThis should be a kind of talent of snake people. It is a divine ability. Anyone who sees their eyes will be solidified!\u201d\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201dA young scholar asked anxiously.In just a while, among the 5,000 troops of the Great Desolate Army, the front row was almost completely solidified.Some of the soldiers behind were also solidified!\u201cDon\u2019t look into their eyes yet!\u201dThe male scholar said, after a pause, he added, \u201cIf we can blindfold them, or if our soldiers don\u2019t look at\u2026\u2026\u201dSpeaking of which.The male scholar could not go on.If the Great Desolate Army didn\u2019t see the snake man.Then\u2026\u2026How else could they attack!Even arrows couldn\u2019t be aimed!As for blindfolding the snake man\u2019s eyes.That\u2019s even more impossible.Others also frowned, stumped by the surprise.Fortunately, the leader of the snake man on the opposite side was releasing petrification.The other snake people next to him didn\u2019t dare to move forward.\u201cRight.\u201dA young soldier suddenly said, \u201cWe can use\u2026.. the third set of plans that we used to deal with the Gollum monsters!\u201dQi gave it a little thought, then he remembered.At that time, when they were targeting the Gollum monsters, there were several options.The one finally adopted, the way to cast gold coins and gems.The third set of plans had not been implemented.\u201cPrepare immediately\u2026\u2026 Fire attack!\u201dQi made an immediate decision and decisively ordered!Immediately, the large pots were carried up by the soldiers and placed on the projectile.The stone thrower, which had been ready for a long time, started quickly.The big pots were fired.The pots arced through the air.They fell into the Snake-People\u2019s camp at the same time.Crackle!When the very lightly made pots hit the giant body of the snake man and broke in an instant, some were pierced directly by the serpents with their tridents!Crash.The kerosene contained inside the large pot leaked out, flowing onto the surrounding desert.The stone thrower in the back continued.Large pots kept pouring over.After a while, on the ground where the snake men were, almost all were penetrated by kerosene!It emitted a pungent smell.\u201cRelease the arrows!\u201dQi ordered loudly.The arrow team was replaced by rockets!In an instant, thousands of arrows were fired!The target was not the snake man on the opposite side.Rather, it was the kerosene on the ground.puff! puff! puff!\u2026\u2026A rocket broke through the air.Some were blocked by tridents, but most still fell on the ground.In an instant, huge flames shot up into the sky!Enveloping the huge body of the snake men in it.\u201cDamn it!\u201dFang Yan in the battle room cursed secretly but there was only a slight frown.Serpents were transcendent creatures and they also had thick scales.They were not afraid of this ordinary fire.The snake people also responded quickly.While they were burying their huge bodies in the sand, they also used the sand to put out the fire by sweeping the sand around with a huge snake tail!But\u2026\u2026The purpose of the Great Desolate Army was not to attack by fire!That kerosene oil was specially made.A lot of other substances were added to it.Once ignited, there would be a thick smoke of fire!As the fire grew larger, the smoke rolled up.The line of sight of the entire competition venue was almost blocked!Until this moment, most of the teachers were watching the game.Only then did they see the real purpose of the rocket launch.In this way, neither side could see the opposite side.The petrification of several snake people didn\u2019t work any longer!\u201cNot bad.\u201dJiang Fan, who had been observing the situation, showed a smile.The moment the bodies of the people of the Great Desolate Army solidified, Jiang Fan then thought of the words \u201cpetrification\u201d.But there was no reminder.Instead, he let the Great Desolate Army discover it on their own.Qi and others were doing a great job.It was soon discovered and quickly thought of a solution!Take advantage of the illness to kill!While the smoke was rolling up, Qi immediately ordered.The soldiers at the back activated their crossbows again.A huge amount of arrows were fired!They achieved great results by this!A snake man who only buried his body in the sand reacted slower.In addition, the surrounding flames were blazing.Their formations were even denser!Ten huge arrows fell!There were seven hits.One shot through the huge body of the snake man and nailed it directly to the ground.Other snake men rushed out of the sand.They would rather\u2026\u2026Endure the thick smoke, and didn\u2019t want to be pierced by such a big arrow.At the same time, the 1,000 Great Desolate Army that had been waiting for a long time, started to move.They were divided into two teams.Five hundred people as a pair.Respectively, from the left and right directions.Straight into both sides of the snake formation.Above the sky, large pots and rockets were constantly being fired at these sides.Providing cover for their operations!These elite cavalrymen were going to finish the final part of the match with a fatal blow!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Despair and admitting defeat! Group leader!Around the three hundred snake men, this was the area with the highest concentration of kerosene and rocket fire.Soon, in these locations, huge flames were burning.There was a wide fire path!Three fire paths plus the field restrictions behind tightly surrounded the snake men in the middle!Although the thick scales on the back of these snake people were not afraid of fire!But\u2026\u2026The scales on the abdomen were not so thick.It looked softer.When it was touched by fire, it was still very painful.This was also after the Transcendental Research Team had studied the video several times.The conclusion reached!The abdomen of the snake man was the weak point.But they were able to put their snake heads down before.They were using their back to meet the enemy.Thus they were avoiding this weakness.Now.Under the double threat of the giant crossbow and the fire, it was not that easy.These snake men were dodging shots from the giant crossbow while they were desperately sweeping the sand with the snake\u2019s tail to put out the flames around.Two cavalry units moved quickly to the periphery of the fire path.With goggles on them, they could be temporarily free from dense smoke.The senses of smell and touch of the snake people that were trapped in the sea of fire were greatly affected.They didn\u2019t even realize that cavalry was coming.Cavalrymen with long bows started shooting towards the weak spots of the snake people \u2013 the snake belly!The soft snake belly could not block the impact of the arrow.\u201cWhoa!\u201dA strange scream of misery came out from one of the closest snake men.An arrow was hit in the abdomen and the blood was dripping out.The other cavalrymen were not to be outdone.Arrows were released!Although this was a collective battle, there was a difference in the military service of each person specifically.The arrows in their hands kept shooting out!The targets were all the abdomen of the snake-man.A giant snake-man was trapped in a tunnel of fire, it became a direct and live target.There were constant screams of misery.Snake men were constantly being hit by arrows!A few giant snake people finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and rushed over!\u201cRetreat!\u201dThe cavalry general immediately waved his hand.A group of cavalrymen quickly retreated.The snake man had to dash through the wide fire path.It simply couldn\u2019t catch up with them.Waiting for these angry snake men to return, the cavalrymen were back and were drawing their bows and shooting!The enemy advanced and they retreated.The enemy retreated and they disturbed.That was the annoying thing about cavalrymen.After a few rounds, the cavalrymen didn\u2019t get hit at all.There were a dozen snake people with arrows in their abdomens.\u201cCharge! Charge out for me!\u201d\u201cYou are the bravest snake warriors!\u201dFang Yan in the battle room opened his eyes wide and shouted extremely unwillingly!He\u2026\u2026He would never allow himself to fail here!The snake people assembled again towards the shield formation in the front, making the final death charge!Under the rush, it simply didn\u2019t hold the formation well.Many snake people even exposed their weak spots, abdomen.Qi also gave the order to attack!Huge arrows and normal arrows were shot at them.That was a crazy attack!The attack of the two cavalries on either side became even more intense.The arrows came one after another and kept shooting into the abdomens of these snake men!Finally\u2026\u2026The first Serpent began to die in battle!Immediately afterward, it was the second one!Third one!\u2026\u2026\u201cI admit defeat!\u201dIn the battle room, after realizing the powerless situation, Fang Yan tightly clenched his palm and his nails almost pierced the flesh.But he still had to surrender!It was a great battle with extremely amazing scenes.This was the end!Jiang Fan\u2026\u2026 Got the final victory!\u201cWon?\u201d\u201cThis actually\u2026\u2026 won?!\u201dInside the viewing room, many people were in disbelief about the results!Originally, after the Snake Man performed Petrification, many teachers almost unanimously believed that Jiang Fan would lose.But nobody expected that the methods of the Great Desolate Army followed one after another would abruptly turn the situation around.They even killed the Snake Men without the power to fight back!Even\u2026\u2026On the side of the Great Desolate Army, not even a single soldier was killed or injured!\u201cWin, I qualified!\u201dTong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei both breathed a sigh of relief!So far, Jiang Fan\u2019s matches were all over!He won nine matches with zero casualties!It did not seem easy, but in fact, it was relatively easy to win this group, the only qualifying spot!He successfully advanced to the top 32!Other group matches were also pretty much underway.Next, there was the elimination round where the difficulty level increased!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: A big fall! The shocked crowd!Jiang Fan slowly walked out of the battle room.He exhaled slightly.For the group matches, Jiang Fan didn\u2019t put in much effort.He was watching like an audience.All strategies and methods were developed by Qi and the Transcendental Research team.Jiang Fan raised his head and looked at the schedule map projected above!There were thirty-two groups.Only a few matches were left to go and the number of qualifying spots was all out!There was almost no suspense.All players broke out from the group and successfully advanced to the elimination round!There were no dark horses either.The only big dark horse was Fang Yan who was favored by many teachers!Unexpectedly he lost to Jiang Fan.This also surprised many people who heard the news later!Jiang Fan?A clean sweep of the group matches?He also defeated Fang Yan, who created a powerful snake race?When a curious person viewed the video of Jiang Fan\u2019s match.Coincidentally\u2026\u2026 There was a common feeling \u2013Are you crazy! You call this an ordinary planet?!An army of several thousand men!Countless numbers of arrows and giant crossbows and kerosene!This TM\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s all made up of ordinary people?But Jiang Fan\u2019s unexpected performance was just a little shocking in the middle of the big competition!People were most concerned about\u2026\u2026Those peerless geniuses!For example, Bu Jing Yue, Fang Zhen Ting, Wang Tianyi\u2026\u2026 These few people.Jiang Fan was also happy to have peace.The competition was held for two days in total.On the first day, there were group matches.Most of the 320 individuals were eliminated straight away.On the second day\u2026\u2026It was the most important elimination round!From each group of ten people, the best of the best would be selected, based on the draw, to set up the matchups!The draw would not be held until the next morning.Before this, it was natural to go home and rest.Before leaving, Tong Zhensheng, the principal of No. 7 Middle School, called Jiang Fan into a lounge alone and took out a copy of the information.\u201cHere is\u2026\u2026 Information about the opponents you may encounter in the next elimination round.\u201dTong Zhensheng handed the information to Jiang Fan and said in a serious tone, \u201cGo back and take a good look at it and prepare for it.\u201d\u201cThank you, principal.\u201dJiang Fan naturally did not refuse!In the group matches, there was a huge difference in strengths.A lot of players did not show their full strength.The match video was not of much value.This information, given by Tong Zhensheng would probably be more content!\u2026\u2026Of course, the school\u2019s rune car personally sent him back home.After a simple meal, Jiang Fan didn\u2019t rest, instead, he entered the awakening space.Looking at the situation of the Great Desolate Army.Resting for this one night, Jiang Fan set the flow of time to five days!Let the Great Desolate Army rest for two more days.But\u2026\u2026Even with the extra two days, Qi still did not relax in any way.There was also a post-match review meeting!In the last match.In the battle with the snake people, Qi was a little dissatisfied with the panic behavior of many soldiers.There was severe criticism at the meeting!Jiang Fan was speechless.For this grand competition, Qi was even more concerned than himself.Jiang Fan held the information given by Tong Zhensheng and passed a copy to Qi.And did not bother.\u2026\u2026The next morning.Jiang Fan got up early.This time, Jiang Fan didn\u2019t need to walk to the competition venue with his legs.The school\u2019s rune car drove straight downstairs.Jiang Fan got in the car and took a look.He discovered that both Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei were there.Naturally, Tang Qingqing was also there.Ma Songtao and the square-faced boy who was eliminated yesterday were also actually there.It seemed that they were going to watch the battle and gain experience.Xiang Junhao, on the other hand, made an excuse not to come.After arriving at the Jiangcheng Center Stadium.Unlike yesterday\u2019s chill, the venue today was a crowded place.A large number of reporters carrying long guns and short cannons were blocking people outside the venue!Blocking was naturally the arrogance of each school!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: The elimination round begins! No.1 Middle School\u2019s Xu Haojie!In the center venue, journalists or the media were not allowed to enter.But outside the arena, the staff was limited.As soon as the cars of the major schools stopped the reporters just swarmed up!It was a very crazy scene.The annual Grand competition had a very high degree of attention in Jiangcheng.It was not just journalists, the major powers including universities had also sent people.Today was the elimination round for the top thirty-two!Each one of them was the pride of the major schools!In this situation, not many people would dare to hold back.They would use all their strength to win!Of the three hundred and twenty people yesterday, there were quite a few that were not strong.Naturally, they did not attract much interest.However, if they performed very well in the elimination rounds, they might be favored by some forces even if they were eliminated in the end.Leaders and teachers from major schools also came there.In comparison, No. 7 Middle School seemed rather shabby.Jiang Fan didn\u2019t want to pay attention to this.In the venue, everyone was waiting for the arrival of the top thirty-two players.The first to be held was the drawing ceremony, hosted by the people of the City Lord\u2019s Mansion.The school behind each player sent out a teacher to come up on stage to draw lots.According to the rules, the qualifier of the first group, Jiang Fan, was given priority for drawing lots!His opponents were going to be the candidates in Group 31 and Group 32.After his draw, the other remaining groups were assigned to the second group of qualifying players!Soon, the draw results were out.The qualifiers from the thirty-first group were drawn\u2014\u2014A talented student from No. 1 Middle School, Xu Haojie was with Jiang Fan!Seeing this result, both Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei frowned slightly.Although the diameter of the planet, Xu Haojie awakened was not top-notch but No. 1 Middle School was the best school in Jiangcheng.Even in the entire Dongyang Province, it was very famous and there was no doubt about their ability to develop students.The civilized planet created by Xu Haojie could not be underestimated!It could be said that they were one of the most difficult opponents in this competition.\u201cYour student named Jiang Fan is lucky.\u201dTeacher Lan Hao from No. 1 Middle School came over and said with a smile: \u201cThis time he encountered the weakest one in our No. 1 Middle School.\u201d\u201cHe still has quite a good chance of winning.\u201d\u201cIf he had run into the other seven then it would be very hard to say.\u201dHearing this, even Tong Zhensheng, who had always been peaceful, couldn\u2019t help but grind his teeth!It was so hateful!This year, there were eight participating students from No. 1 Middle School.Surprisingly, all of them made it to the elimination round.It was an unprecedented miracle.The result of the No. 7 middle school was certainly not bad but it was completely incomparable with the No. 1 middle school.Not to mention, No. 7 Middle School and No. 1 Middle School had always been old enemies.In many previous sessions, most students of No. 7 Middle School were eliminated at the hands of the No. 1 middle school students during the elimination round.Most of the top-ranked players except for Jiang Fan were the favorite candidates to win this competition because the strength and reputation of the latter were much weaker.There was almost no suspense in this round.Only the confrontation between Jiang Fan and Xu Haojie was something that no one dared to judge!The people who had gathered in the venue had been talking about it.\u201cJiang Fan should win. I have watched the group match between Jiang Fan and Fang Yan. Fang Yan was good, but he still lost to Jiang Fan.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true. Fang Yan is good, but Xu Haojie was cultivated in No. 1 Middle School, and he created an intermediate civilization. He definitely can\u2019t be compared to Fang Yan. For this battle\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m optimistic about Xu Haojie!\u201d\u201cI support Jiang Fan, just because Jiang Fan cultivates only ordinary people, I will support him!\u201d\u201cJiang Fan was able to defeat so many transcendent civilizations with his ordinary human civilization, it\u2019s hard not to believe that he\u2019ll create another miracle!\u201d\u201cHehe! You guys are still too naive. The team Jiang Fan was in was very weak, so he could pass with just the number of people, and\u2026\u2026 Which of these top thirty-two opponents weren\u2019t the geniuses that every school focused on nurturing, and the ones that they built were not intermediate civilizations or above? It\u2019s time for Jiang Fan to reach his end!\u201d\u2026\u2026Everyone was expressing their own opinions.There were those who supported Xu Haojie.There were also people who were optimistic about Jiang Fan!Jiang Fan walked toward the battle room step by step amidst the murmurs of the crowd.The elimination rounds for the top thirty-two\u2026\u2026Officially started!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Crushing the genius of No. 1 middle school! The concept of Elements!Outside the battle room, Jiang Fan met his opponent this time \u2013 Xu Haojie, the top talent of the No. 1 Middle School!\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 are very good.\u201dXu Haojie looked at Jiang Fan and said indifferently: \u201cUnfortunately\u2026\u2026 not my opponent.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d Jiang Fan smiled faintly.Then he entered the battle room.After that he entered the awakening space.The Great Desolate Army led by Qi was waiting at the entrance of the passage.There was a look of excitement on each face of the Great Desolate Army.It seemed that\u2026\u2026In five days of rest, the long spears in their hands had become a little thirsty.The match started soon.What Xu Haojie built was a rare planet of intermediate civilization\u2014\u2014Talisman civilization!Everyone on the planet could draw talismans and use the talisman!One could gather the energy of the planet in the Talisman.They could make a variety of talismans.For example\u2026\u2026Rain, Shadow, Weapon, Plant, Animal, etc.In the group matches, there was also some hidden strength.In the group matches, Xu Haojie only dispatched two hundred talismans at most and when fighting against Jiang Fan.He directly used his trump card.In total, there were more than three hundred talisman masters.It had to be said that the students from No. 1 Middle School were indeed different from other schools.The formation was also neatly arranged.There were almost no flaws.Of course it couldn\u2019t be compared to the Great Desolate Army that had been trained for several years!At the beginning, Xu Haojie was also very cautious.There was no offense.Instead, these talisman masters had taken a defensive position!Jiang Fan watched quietly.For this battle, Qi naturally prepared for five days.He repeatedly watched the recording of these Talisman Masters.Looking for the opponent\u2019s weaknesses.As for\u2026\u2026A hundred or more talisman masters, that was not the point anymore.After analyzing, the people of the Transcendental Research team judged Talisman Master by the formation.There were basically no weaknesses.If I had to say there was.That would be\u2026\u2026These talisman masters who had just started, the talisman power they made was not very strong!It was slightly stronger than ordinary arrows.But that\u2019s all!After some discussion, Qi decided to change his previous strategy.In this battle, they took the initiative to get each team of soldiers in front.All of them were hanging a giant shield!The soldiers pushed their shields and slowly approached the Talisman masters.The archery teams behind them were shooting wildly.For cover!Clang!Clang!Clang!\u2026\u2026The various talismans of the talisman masters were poured frantically on the slowly advancing shield.But these shields were made of iron.The power of the talisman was not much, so they could not do much damage to them.It was completely invulnerable.If it was in the wild, the talisman masters could completely disperse.They could attack the bulky shield formation from the side but this was the battlefield.The space was limited.There was no such statement.Seeing this scene, Xu Haojie, who did not expect the Great Desolate Army to adopt this tactic, became anxious.His eyes were also quite sharp.A quick glance revealed the weakness of the shield formation.He gave a direct order to the talisman masters to disperse and attack the soldier behind the shield from the side.But the Great Desert Army had been waiting for this moment for a long time.Once the talisman masters dispersed and the formation was messed up, the cavalry that followed behind the shield, went straight for it!This time, it was no ordinary cavalry.It was a heavy cavalry with heavy armor all over!If the talisman would hit them, it basically had no effect.One thousand heavy cavalry, like a fierce tiger, heavily rushed into the Talisman Masters\u2019 formation.A group of talisman masters panicked and one by one fell to the ground.Looking at this one-sided situation, Xu Haojie could only take a deep breath and said helplessly, \u201cI admit defeat!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cWon.\u201d\u201cHaha, Jiang Fan really didn\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\u201cI knew Jiang Fan would win!\u201dInside the viewing room, Tong Zhensheng and the others all breathed a sigh of relief.Jiang Fan won this battle without risk!Jiang Fan smoothly defeated his opponent.He was urgently waiting for the next round.The opponent in the next round was also a genius from No. 1 Middle School!Meanwhile, far above the Blue Star, in Xia Kingdom\u2019s Kewu Academy.During this time, a mineral research room that no one paid attention to.A scholar named \u201cCheng Shi\u201d.Through long years of research on minerals.A major discovery had been made.He came up with a concept called \u201celements\u201d!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Gun Powder\u2019s upgraded Version!When Qi led the Great Desolate Army to participate in the Great Competition.Almost all the manpower and departments of Xia Kingdom were served for this purpose.The mineral research room where Cheng Shi was working was quite valued but at this time no one paid attention to it.Cheng Shi was a research scholar who was a bit of a nerd.During this time, he should pay attention to the battle situation of the Great Desolate Army.However, he still dove into the research room.He was now the only one in the entire research lab who was still working properly.Other scholars were transferred to the logistics team or to other departments.On this day, Cheng Shi was still the same as usual.At 6:00 pm he was going home from work.When he was about to close the door of the laboratory.From the corner of his eyes, he glanced at the experiment.A piece of metal iron held in a glass vessel, under the light from outside.It gave off a faint light.This ray of light shone into Cheng Shi\u2019s eyes.His brain suddenly lit up when he saw that!All along research and speculations about the origin of matter had been carried out.Because of Jiang Fan\u2019s six questions.Qi also took it seriously.The term element had long been proposed.However\u2026\u2026For a long period of time, many scholars of the Xia Kingdom, regarded elements as simple substances that could not be further divided by chemical methods.Those substances that could not be decomposed again were called simple substances.They called it an element!It confused or equated the concepts of element and elemental substance.Their understanding of the origin of material composition was solved through observation or speculation on objective things.Then the rise of experimentation came.Some experimental data on material changes had been accumulated.It was only from the results of chemical analysis that the concepts about elements or elemental substances were initially addressed.What Cheng Shi did was such a boring job.It was mainly the study of various metals!But due to the lack of precise experimental materials, this issue had also not been resolved.For example, elemental oxygen and oxygen were not the same things!The former was the element.The latter could be regarded as a single substance.And now the Xia Kingdom regarded oxygen as an element!But Cheng Shi was an exception.All along. he had studied not only metals but also oxygen, nitrogen, sulfuric acid and so on.Long-term research and experimentation, let Cheng Shi think this division was not precise.Looking at the dim light emanating from the metal iron!Cheng Shi suddenly realized!He thought of the biological cells he once saw under the microscope!Then\u2026\u2026Metals, oxygen, these monomers could be also formed by something simpler and more singular?This kind of thing should be an element.Thinking about it, Cheng Shi was very excited.He couldn\u2019t be bothered to go home.He directly re-entered the research room.Then he turned on the lights.He carried out confirmation of the guess in the mind.A few days later, Cheng Shi hardly ate or drank.He had been non-stop experimenting, thinking, experimenting, thinking\u2026\u2026Almost no one paid attention to Cheng Shi\u2019s anomaly.Except for Jiang Fan!Although he was participating in the competition.However, Jiang Fan still paid attention to the development of Blue Star from time to time.Especially, he thought that the scholars had potential.Cheng Shi\u2026\u2026 was one of them!When seeing Cheng Shi\u2019s anomaly.Jiang Fan carefully observed him for a few days.\u201cNice guy.\u201dJiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.In Jiang Fan\u2019s anticipation, the real concept of the elements was according to his previous life.The chemical element was a general term for a class of atoms that had the same nuclear charge.An element was the result of a quantitative change in the number of protons of an atom leading to a qualitative change.It should not be something that could be found in this era.But Cheng Shi found it.Unfortunately, the conditions of this era were limited.Cheng Shi\u2019s experiments could not fully support his vision.\u201cWhat a pity!\u201dJiang Fan knew that.With the current conditions of the Xia Kingdom.Even the extraction of metallic elements was difficult.In a sense, Cheng Shi was also born in the wrong era.But\u2026\u2026Cheng Shi still made a huge contribution.Soon after.Cheng Shi was the first to put forward the concept of \u201catoms\u201d.And considered it to be the smallest unit of the matter!This statement was not really accurate.But it laid the foundation for the development of the discipline of chemical elements and chemistry!This was an afterthought.In Cheng Shi\u2019s research, the most practical thing so far was\u2026\u2026The upgraded version of gun powder\u2026\u2026Yellow gunpowder!Also known as modern explosives.Early entry into history!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Crushing Two geniuses in a Row! The No.1 middle school teacher is crying!It\u2019s just that\u2026\u2026Yellow powder was not made so quickly.Today.It was still dominated by black gunpowder.As the trump card of the Great Desolate Army.It was always closely guarded by Qi\u2019s personal guards!Except for Qi, no one could move it.Big competition now was not lined up yet.Because\u2026\u2026After advancing to the quarterfinals.The next opponent was still from No. 1 Middle School, a genius favored by many teachers\u2014\u2014Lin Taihe!His group match performance was amazing!That group of Lin Taihe was the recognized death group.There were three awakened planets over 25 km in diameter!One of them\u2026\u2026It was Xiang Junhao who had been eliminated!Lin Taihe was one of them.The diameter of the planet he awakened was 27.5 kilometers!It was the lowest among these three.But\u2026\u2026He was the one who finally qualified out of the group!Xiang Junhao and another genius were defeated by him.Top thirty-two.It was also a steady win against a player in the upper third!Command on the battlefield was not arrogant or impetuous.There were degrees of advancement and retreat.They were good at grasping the opponent\u2019s weaknesses.They were considered to have the style of a great general!\u201cAlthough the diameter of the planet that Lin Taihe has awakened is not the top, his personality is mature and his temperament is quite good, his future achievements will definitely not be bad!\u201dOne teacher commented.\u201cJiang Fan can defeat Xu Haojie, but he is definitely not Lin Taihe\u2019s opponent.\u201dA teacher said with great certainty.There were also people who were optimistic about Jiang Fan.But more people appreciated Lin Taihe who looked more mature!As rumored, outside the battle room, Jiang Fan ran into Lin Taihe.The other party also greeted him very politely.\u201cI must win this game!\u201dIn the battle room, Lin Taihe clenched his fists and said with a hint of confidence in his eyes: \u201cAlthough Jiang Fan has a large army of ordinary people, he will have weaknesses.\u201d\u201cJust grab those weaknesses.\u201d\u201cWinning this game is not a difficult task!\u201dFrom the previous match video, Jiang Fan naturally knew it.What Lin Taihe awakened was the intermediate level energy profound energy.He created an intermediate civilization\u2014\u2014Mysterious civilization!This was a civilization somewhat similar to martial artists!As soon as the match started, Jiang Fan found out that the profound practitioners on the opposite side of the battlefield were covered in thick new vine armor, with a vine shield in hand as compared to the group matches with only clothes on.Obviously, it was made in a hurry to deal with the arrows of the Great Desolate Army.\u201cCharge!\u201dAs soon as it came up, Lin Taihe gave a direct order.Let these profound practitioners in vine armor rush to the Great Desolate Army formation!The speed of the profound practitioners was a little faster than the martial artist.From the scene, Lin Taihe\u2019s targeting the Great Desolate Army, made it to the extreme!However\u2026\u2026All of this was expected by Qi.Qi knew the weakness of the Great Desolate Army better than anyone.So he prepared it in advance to deal with martial artists.According to the findings of the Transcendental Research team, Tiangong Academy had secretly made a rather \u201ccruel\u201d weapon!In the previous matches, as the opponent was too weak, it was not really useful at all.Today, it was time for it to play out.This weapon was \u2013Caltrop!With the current technological level of Xia Kingdom, the caltrops that were made were sort of a super doubled version than in the previous ancient times.Those thorns were glowing with a cold light.The people who saw it were horrified!It was still poisonous!Although these profound practitioners wore thick and crude vine armor.But there were no shoes on the soles of the feet.Why were they not wearing shoes?It was not just these profound practitioners, so did the martial artists in front of them.Mainly because of the transcendental planet that had just awakened a month ago.The number of transcendental races was too small.Almost all of the time was spent practicing.They couldn\u2019t care less about the dress piece.The opponent in the front was dressed in a very skimpy way and most of the shoes were uncomfortable straw sandals!Instead of wearing it, it was easier to go to battle barefoot.This detail was something other people didn\u2019t care about.But the people from the transcendental research team noticed.Therefore, the poisonous caltrops were born!Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u2026\u2026Hundreds and thousands of caltrops were thrown out.Sprinkled all over the ground in front of the shield formation.As soon as the profound practitioner who ran at high speed landed!Half of the people stepped on the caltrops!\u201cAhh!\u201d\u2026\u2026The screams kept ringing.It was okay even if the sole of the foot was pierced.But the caltrops were highly poisonous.However, the injured profound practitioner\u2019s legs quickly became paralyzed!They were unable to move.The Great Desolate Army took advantage of the illness to kill!Right after that, the arrows rained down!In an instant, it took the lives of a dozen profound practitioners!\u2026\u2026This battle lost its suspense.In the back, other than the profound practitioners struggling, it was the one-sided harvest of the Great Desolate Army.The Great Desolate Army had rain of arrows, giant crossbows, kerosene, giant shield formations, light and heavy cavalry, and caltrops!They had so many cards.How can you spike me?How do you expect me to lose?After the profound practitioner had sacrificed more than forty lives.Lin Taihe had no choice but to give up resistance.He chose to admit defeat!\u2026\u2026\u201cF*ck\u2026\u2026 There\u2019s actually such a trick?\u201d\u201cJiang Fan actually used the completely inconspicuous detail of not wearing shoes. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\u201cLin Taihe actually lost just like that. Where\u2019s the needle-tip-to-?\u201d\u2026\u2026Inside the viewing room, everyone watching the battle looked dumbfounded!This was also them.For the first time, they felt the \u201camazing skills\u201d of the Great Desolate Army!It was a complete IQ suppression!As for the teachers of the No. 1 middle school, there were slight tears in the corners of their eyes.Before, they had constantly bullied others by relying on techniques and tactics.But they didn\u2019t expect that there would be a day.They were also crushed by others in the same way!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: The top eight are out! An expected showdown!Walking out of the battle room.Meeting Lin Taihe again, Lin Taihe didn\u2019t say hello.His face was gloomy.Mature personality?Bullshit!That was on the premise of always winning.Under Lin Taihe\u2019s delicate appearance, he was also a very arrogant person on the inside.He couldn\u2019t accept his own failure!Jiang Fan, on the other hand, returned to the lounge and waited for the other matches to finish.According to the rules of the Grand competition.For the Top 16, there were a total of eight matches.Each of the matches was held at the same time.After all, the matches were over, the next round would take place!The match between Jiang Fan and Lin Taihe was recognized as the most suspenseful.But no one expected that it would end so quickly!Inside the viewing room, seeing Lin Taihe surrender.The corner of Qiu Yunfei\u2019s mouth curled into a smile, and he said, \u201cJiang Fan\u2019s luck is really good. If it wasn\u2019t for the No. 1 Middle School students, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s not that easy to pass.\u201dHearing this, the face of Lan Hao in No. 1 Middle School became a little ugly.The other teachers almost laughed out loud.Earlier, after the results of the elimination round draw, Lan Hao once mockingly said \u2013\u201cJiang Fan\u2019s luck is good. He actually ran into students from our No. 1 Middle School. He should be able to win easily.\u201dNow\u2026\u2026Sure enough, he was caught by him!Two of the No. 1 middle school\u2019s top geniuses.One after another, they were cut down by Jiang Fan.The process was exceptionally easy.It took almost no effort.Not long after that, other matches had also ended.The results were no surprise.Exactly as many teachers predicted.Several favorites were victorious.And took a spot in the top eight.So far, the top eight list was out \u2013Jiang Fan from No. 7 Middle School!Bu Jing Yue from No. 1 middle school!Fang Zhenting from No.3 Middle School!Lu Tao from No. 2 Middle School!Wang Tianyi from Jin Yao Middle School!Tang Qingqing from No. 7 Middle School!And the other two were talented students from No. 1 Middle School!Especially the first six.The most popular!If we talk about the previous top sixteen.They were still strong and weak!But\u2026\u2026Today\u2019s top eight were the strongest matchup.It was hard to predict the winner.\u201cF*ck, the first five are all super-geniuses who have awakened the planet more than 30 kilometers!\u201d\u201cTang Qingqing, who is ranked sixth, is also not far behind and is said to have awakened an advanced civilization!\u201d\u201cExcept for the latter two, which are slightly weaker\u2026\u2026 the former are all demons.\u201dThis time.Jiang Fan easily crushed everyone along the way.Some people had also ranked him in the demon class!\u201cThis is going to be a good show!\u201d\u201cThere are four groups of top eight matchups, and two of the top six super geniuses are bound to be grouped together!\u201d\u201cWere you taught math by a gym teacher? Not two\u2026\u2026 But two teams! There must be two teams that are strong!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting. Bu Jing Yue, Lu Tao, and Tang Qingqing are all my favorite players, but two people must be eliminated in this round!\u201d\u201cLook at the top, the match table has come out!\u201dHearing this, everyone looked up.The leaders and teachers of various schools also looked.The projection above the matchups for the top eight was already out!After the thirty-two draw.The next matchup was pretty much straightforward.For Jiang Fan as the number one player, the matchup was bound to be against a player from the bottom half of the field.This time it was not by draw.Instead, it was based on the time each player ended the match in the previous round\u2026\u2026To determine the top and bottom half of the rankings.For example.Jiang Fan was the first to finish the match.Then he would face the last one to end the match in the bottom half!Bu Jing Yue was the second-fastest to finish the match.She would play against the second-to-last finisher in the bottom half.And so on.The matchup was clear \u2013Jiang Fan vs. Tang Qingqing.Bu Jing Yue vs. Lin Qiang Fei, also from the No. 1 middle school.Fang Zhending vs. He Jianbin, also from No. 1 Middle School.Lu Tao vs Wang Tianyi!See this exciting matchup, there was an uproar.Conversations erupted!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You are familiar with Tang Qingqing\u2019s brother Tang Yushu, do you know something?\u201d\u201cTang Qingqing\u2019s true strength\u2026\u2026 The principal will be able to witness it later.\u201dQiu Yunfei smiled mysteriously.After resting for about an hour.The quarter-finals had officially started!The first to appear were Bu Jing Yue and Lin Qiang Fei!It was a civil war of the No.1 middle school.But nobody cared.The result was no surprise.As a player from the same school.Lin Qiangfei naturally knew the trump card of Bu Jing Yue.The match didn\u2019t take long\u2026\u2026Just surrender and admit defeat.Bu Jing Yue won easily.Next.It was Fang Zhenting and He Jianbin from No. 1 Middle School!This match was a little frustrating.But He Jianbin used all his means.Nor was he a match for the more powerful party \u2013 Fang Zhenting.He was eliminated from the match!Everyone could see that.Organized by\u2026\u2026This was deliberately putting the two most anticipated strong matches later!At last.The third matchup!Lu Tao vs Wang Tianyi\u2019s battle of geniuses was here!Both of them transformed high-level energy!It was also a high-level civilization planet.The strength was extremely close!The scene of the match was like Mars hitting the earth.It was very intense.After nearly three hours of a fierce battle.In the end, Lu Tao\u2026\u2026 was better!He was very thrilled to win this match.Next, it was the top priority.The battle that received the most attention and anticipation in the quarterfinal-Jiang Fan vs. Tang Qingqing.Civil War of the No. 7 middle school!It was not just teachers at major schools.Even some of the leaders came.Because\u2026\u2026Tang Qingqing\u2019s brother.Tang Yushu from Tianxing University was also here.Watching Tang Qingqing\u2019s match in person.Many people had heard about it.Tang Yushu will be the recruiting teacher of Tianxing University this year.So.One by one, everyone was taking advantage of this opportunity.They came up to pull the strings and get close.\u201cThis battle\u2026\u2026 should be more exciting, but there will be no suspense in the outcome.\u201d\u201cTang Qingqing\u2019s magical civilization is too powerful.

This time\u2026\u2026 I will show all my cards, which is a respect for the opponent who broke Jiangcheng\u2019s record!\u201dSoon, the competition officially started.On the side of Tang Qingqing.The first to appear was\u2026\u2026Four hundred noble magicians!As compared to the previous competitions, there were hundred more!This was Tang Qingqing\u2019s trump card.The passage was not closed.Inside\u2026\u2026Another bunch of figures appeared!When people saw them, everyone was shocked!\u201cHoly shit, this\u2026\u2026 No way?!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026 How is this possible?\u201d\u201cUnbelievable! I actually managed to meet such a demonic genius again!\u201d\u2026\u2026Even the always calm Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei were all shocked for a moment!!PS: The classification of civilizations in the universe \u2013The first level of civilization: planetary civilizationThis was the lowest level of civilization, our human civilization was climbing this level, it should be in the intermediate stage. Not only was this level of civilization able to travel freely in space beyond the gravitational constraints of the home planet\u2019s continent, but at the peak of this level, it was also able to explore and establish colonies and living research areas on other planets. Medical technology would also be a great breakthrough, most of the genetic control range of diseases could be completely cured, and the basic laws of the universe and initial controlled nuclear fusion technology were also mastered by it.Second level civilization: Stellar civilizationCivilizations at this level were able to build devices similar to \u201cDyson spheres\u201d to perfectly collect stellar energy and humans at this stage basically had no energy crisis. Not only that, in terms of aerospace technology, stellar civilizations were able to conduct preliminary exploration between galaxies and were able to send scientific manned spacecraft to other stars.At the individual level, this level of civilization was able to improve its own efficiency by implanting computing chips into the body, otherwise, the vast scientific system of basic learning would be extremely long and it might not be able to learn a lifetime of the smallest branch of science. Basic known diseases would be completely cured and the average human lifespan would reach 200 years. Not only that but there was a certain probability that alien civilizations would meet and intersect when exploring across galaxies.Third level civilization: Galactic civilizationCivilizations at this level had fully realized travel between galaxies and were able to establish colonies in suitable galaxies, not only that civilizations were able to send super-probes across the galaxy, for example, from within the Milky Way to Andromeda.The science and technology tree of this civilization was more luxurious, and the classification of science was more refined. For the development and inheritance of science, the number of scientists in this civilization needs to be based on at least 10 billion. In order to learn more efficiently, the general chip was no longer enough for the individual of civilization. Civilization may directly modify the DNA of the individual to realize the strengthening of the body from the bottom. At this time, there would be extensive collisions and exchanges between different galaxy civilizations, and ordinary energy could no longer meet the development of cutting-edge science.The fourth level of civilization: the River system civilizationThis level of civilization was able to conduct large-scale cross-river tourism and even high-latitude exploration. This stage was already unimaginable for human civilization at this stage. But they should have been freed from the shackles of the flesh, and they could obtain the civilization of the entire galaxy to carry out interstellar warfare at the river level.Fifth level civilization: Dimensional civilizationCivilizations of this level were able to travel across dimensions and multi-dimensional space was no longer an obstacle for them. They already had unlimited energy sources, the survival of this civilization was completely guaranteed, war and aggression may disappear completely, and their only goal was to explore other universes.The sixth level of civilization: Cosmic civilizationCosmic civilization had completely mastered all the physical laws of this universe and could apply them flexibly, and causal weapons may have appeared. Distance and dimension were no longer obstacles for them, and they could even travel across universes. In a sense, this civilization could be said to be omnipotent in this universe, equivalent to the \u201crole of God\u201d, they were the rules themselves.Seventh level of civilizationThis level of civilization was beyond our imagination. Perhaps no civilization could reach this level. Perhaps it was no longer suitable to describe it as civilization. They were no longer created by the universe, but they were creators of the universe themselves.

The response of Great Desolate Army!In this battle with Tang Qingqing, Jiang Fan was naturally prepared.He watched all previous match videos of Tang Qingqing.Jiang Fan used the projection method\u2026\u2026To send it to Qi.What Tang Qingqing transformed was high level energy \u2013 magic power!It was also an advanced civilization \u2013 magic civilization!Magic civilization.In advanced civilization,\u00a0it was an extremely powerful one!The magic cast by the magicians had a huge power like destroying the world!Although Tang Qingqing\u2019s diameter of the awakened planet\u00a0couldn\u2019t exceed 30 kilometers.It was not as good as people like Lu Tao, Fang Zhenting, Wang Tianyi.But the civilization created was much\u00a0better!This was also the case with many teachers.The reason for the unanimous favorable view of Tang Qingqing\u00a0was in front of the magician.Especially in front of the four hundred magicians owned by Tang Qingqing.Although the number of the Great Desolate Army was large.But it was not a match.It was the\u00a0high explosive and powerful force of magic!There was a three-day break from the end of the previous match to this one.Qi barely rested so much.His mind was completely focused on\u00a0how to deal with those\u00a0terrible spells of the magicians!In the Transcendental Research Team, there were fifty people in total.All of them were devoted to the study of magic.Qi did not dare to be careless about this one.20,000 troops were dispatched directly!Seeing this extra 10,000 people.Many people were taken aback.They sighed in their heart, \u201cThis Jiang Fan\u2019s cards are hidden deep enough.\u201dBut there was still no teacher who was optimistic about Jiang Fan\u2019s side.Because\u2026\u2026The space of the battlefield was limited.The instantaneous explosive power of four hundred magicians was enough to take the field where the Great Desolate Army side was located.Destroy them all!In 10,000 and 20,000 numbers, there was basically no difference.Jiang Fan was also secretly watching.He also knew\u00a0that this battle was different from all previous matches.It won\u2019t be easy.The strength of the opponent was geometric growth!Even\u2026\u2026The Great Desolate Army should be prepared for casualties.When Tang Qingqing sent out all four hundred magicians.When one by one they stood on the field with nobility.On the side of Great Desolate Army.The faces of Qi and the Transcendent Research Team\u2026\u2026All slightly changed!Three hundred was enough.That\u2019s one hundred more.It was harder to deal with.\u201cGet ready!\u201dQi shouted.The Great Desolate Army in front of them immediately set up a huge shield\u00a0and\u00a0every single soldier of the Great Desolate Army behind them carried a small shield with them.This was to guard against spell attacks.They made these shields urgently.However\u2026\u2026Tang Qingqing\u2019s side was not over yet.After four hundred magicians appeared.The door of the passage did not close.From behind the open door, another bunch of figures with uncommon aura appeared.One by one, they stepped out.When you see the layers of translucent air shrouds that covered the exterior of these people\u2019s bodies.Everyone was shocked!\u201cDou Qi!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Dou Qi Transformation Armor!\u201d\u201cThat air cover seems to be made of Dou Qi energy!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Tang Qingqing build a magical civilization? Why is there Dou Qi?\u201d\u2013 A surprised voice sounded.Seeing such an unbelievable scene, the entire viewing room was abuzz with excitement.Dou Qi!It was one of the more common types of energy in the intermediate civilizations.No one was unfamiliar with it.But appearing here was too surprising.What Tang Qingqing transformed was magic energy.\u201cDual Energy! It\u2019s Dual Energy!\u201d\u201cYes, magic power and Dou Qi, it\u2019s definitely Dual Energy!\u201d\u201cWhat Tang Qingqing transformed in the first place should not only be magic energy! There was also Dou Qi energy! In other words, her planet\u2026\u2026 has two types of transcendent energy!\u201d\u201cA dual energy civilization?! F*ck!\u201d\u201cDoes a dual-energy civilization really exist? How come I\u2019ve never heard of it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you are ignorant. Dual-energy civilization has appeared before, but the probability is very small! Even\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s more difficult to be born than super civilization!\u201d\u201cSurprisingly, it\u2019s Dual Energy! No wonder\u2026\u2026 Tang Qingqing had previously been declaring that she wanted to get second place in this Grand Competition!\u201dThe crowd was in an uproar.One by one, they were in heated discussion.Some people still looked excited.Because\u2026\u2026They were witnessing history!\u201cA dual-energy civilization.\u201dIn the viewing room, an old teacher looked at the picture on the projection and sighed, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this kind of scene for so many years.\u201d\u201cThe last dual energy civilization I remember\u2026\u2026\u201dA middle-aged teacher had a flash of memory in his eyes, and said, \u201cIn the Jiangcheng Competition more than ten years ago, a student of the No. 3 middle school transformed dual energy \u2013 profound energy and true energy!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe two energies of profound energy and true energy were not compatible.\u201d\u201cThat student\u2019s talent was also a bit poor, and he failed to carry it forward.\u201dThe teachers next to him all nodded.Many people had led teams through that big competition back then.Naturally, it left an impression.\u201cBut Tang Qingqing is different.\u201dThe aged teacher\u2019s face showed a hint of relief and said, \u201cShe transformed two transcendent energies, magic and Dou Qi, and these two energies can be said to be a perfect match!\u201dNone of the other teachers objected.They were able to act as lead teachers.What a wide range of vision and knowledge.Naturally, it was clear what dual-energy civilization meant.Although dual energy civilizations were rare.But not all dual energy\u2026\u2026 were comparable to super civilizations.For example,The profound energy and true energy mentioned above.This Dual Energy did not go well together.It was only a minimal help to the growth of strength.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Dual Energy civilization! The response of Great Desolate Army!This was not the case with magic and Dou Qi.It was well known that\u00a0magicians had a huge weakness at lower levels.That would be\u00a0seen by their bodies.Low-level magicians\u00a0had very average physical fitness.Even\u00a0some low-level magicians were weaker than ordinary people.Plus low-level magicians take time to cast spells.These two were the weaknesses\u00a0of\u00a0the magic civilization in the beginning.It would\u00a0be targeted by many intermediate and low-level civilizations!At the previous big competition.Because of these two weaknesses, a student who built a magical civilization was defeated by a low-level martial artist civilization!But the warriors created by Dou Qi energy were known for their strong defensive nature.If it was while the magician was chanting.The warrior could stand in the front for the defense.Then\u00a0they would wait for the magician to finish chanting.This way there would be nothing left to stop them.Almost everyone knew that the longer\u00a0the magician chanted, the more powerful the magic unleashed!But in general, because of the threat of the opponent.Low-level magicians chanted very short, and threw the magic out quickly.However, with the warriors who could turn their Dou Qi into armor, they could resist.Magicians didn\u2019t have to worry about these problems anymore!One could say, magicians and warriors was a perfect match by nature.Warriors were responsible for defense\u00a0and creating space and time for the magician to cast spells.And the magician who finished chanting was responsible for the removal and destruction of the opponent!It was a match made in heaven.Magic energy and Dou Qi!It was also recognized as a super combination of one plus one, which was definitely greater than two!\u201cThis Tang Qingqing has hidden deep enough.\u201dEven Tong Zhensheng could not help but sigh at this moment.As the principal of the No. 7 middle school, he didn\u2019t even know that his students also created a dual-energy civilization!\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 should have known that already.\u201dTong Zhensheng looked at Qiu Yunfei and said, \u201cNo wonder you were so sure before that Tang Qingqing will definitely win this time!\u201dThere was a trace of anger in his eyes.If Tang Qingqing had not taken the initiative to expose it today.He was going to be kept in the dark.\u201cPrincipal, it\u2019s not my fault.\u201dQiu Yunfei hurriedly waved his hand and said, \u201cIt was Tang Yushu who told me not to.\u201dTong Zhensheng was naturally not really angry, he smiled and said: \u201cMage plus warrior, Tang Qingqing\u2019s strength is stronger than the previous students of No. 7 middle school, but\u2026\u2026\u201dTong Zhensheng did not continue.Qiu Yunfei naturally understood what Tong Zhensheng meant.He nodded his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a pity. This year, she ran into a monster like Bu Jing Yue.\u201d\u201cIf it had been any previous session instead.\u201d\u201cThe winner is definitely Tang Qingqing!\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dA familiar teacher came up and said, \u201cIf Tang Qingqing only had\u00a0magicians, then her strength would be\u00a0similar to that of Lu Tao, Fang Zhenting, and Wang Tianyi.\u201d\u201cBut with these two hundred more warriors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely overpowering them.\u201d\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t encounter Bu Jing Yue before the final.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s bound to be the runner-up in this Grand Competition!\u201dThere were many teachers and leaders\u00a0running to Tang Yushu.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that yet.\u201dTang Yushu waved his hand and said, \u201cThe match hasn\u2019t ended yet, anything can happen.\u201d\u201cWhat else is there to fight?\u201dA teacher smiled slightly and said loudly: \u201cIf Tang Qingqing only had a magical civilization, then Jiang Fan may still fight, but now\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIn addition to that, there are two hundred warriors who can turn their Dou Qi into armor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of how long it\u2019s going to take for the match to end.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s basically no suspense.\u201dAnother teacher responded: \u201cTwo hundred warriors are enough to defend against the onslaught of Jiang Fan\u2019s army!\u201d\u201cWait for the group of four hundred magicians to finish chanting.\u201d\u201cNot to mention the 20,000 troops.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s an army of 100,000\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt will only end up being destroyed by magic!\u201dNone of the teachers objected to the categorical statements of these two teachers.There were so many teachers,\u00a0optimistic about Jiang Fan.Then\u2026\u2026As\u00a0the two hundred warriors appeared, these optimistic voices disappeared immediately.\u201cThis was originally thought to be a strong dialogue, but I didn\u2019t expect\u2026 Tang Qingqing showed her trump card, dual-energy civilization? This is completely unnecessary!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity for Jiang Fan, if it wasn\u2019t for the monster Tang Qingqing, there is a high probability that he would be able to advance to the top four!\u201d\u201cSigh, I can\u2019t help it. I like Jiang Fan a lot too, but Tang Qingqing is too abnormal.\u201d\u201cI also support Jiang Fan. There are many strategies, and the on-the-spot response is very awesome. I appreciate all these, but\u2026\u2026 In the face of absolute strength, all\u00a0strategies are useless.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad for an ordinary civilization to get this far, at least\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s never been done before.\u201d\u201cThe top eight is okay. Although he lost this time\u2026\u2026 but it\u2019s just a big competition. It\u2019ll come back after the college entrance examination.\u201dCountless viewers were talking\u00a0about Jiang Fan\u2019s previous performance.It had attracted a lot of girls and boys.There were also many people who supported Jiang Fan.Now\u2026\u2026One by one, they felt sorry for each other!It\u2019s not that they\u00a0were incompetent, the enemy had a real Gundam.If anyone, within the venue,\u00a0had confidence in the Great Desolate Army, that was\u00a0Jiang Fan.\u201cIs it a dual energy civilization?

The Dual Energy civilization! The response of the Great Desolate Army!Jiang Fan looked at the four hundred magicians and two hundred warriors on the battlefield.His eyebrows raised slightly.\u201cWarrior and magician, Dual cultivation of magic and martial arts.\u201dJiang Fan muttered in his mouth.His face was relatively calm.Although Tang Qingqing\u2019s trump card was astounding,\u00a0it was still within Jiang Fan\u2019s tolerance.Inside the battlefield,\u00a0seeing another group of two hundred people walk out.As well as\u2026\u2026The translucent cover on the exterior of the bodies of two hundred people.This was the first time Tang Qingqing had shown her true trump card in front of the public.The Great Desolate Army naturally could not know.\u201cDou Qi armor? There are actually warriors on the other side?!\u201dAn elderly scholar said in surprise.\u201cAccording to what we know about transcendental energy.\u201dA scholar specializing in transcendent energy said: \u201cDou Qi belongs to intermediate energy, and it is a relatively powerful type of intermediate energy. Transcendent people of Dou Qi civilization are generally called fighters or warriors.\u201d\u201cThis energy can form all kinds of energy objects.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDou Qi into armor, Dou Qi into horses, Dou Qi into wings, etc.\u201d\u201cJudging from the situation of the warriors on the other side, I can tell\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe opponent\u2019s Dou Qi energy is very pure.\u201d\u201cIt can be said that\u2026\u2026 it has almost touched the boundary of advanced energy.\u201d\u201cThat means.\u201d\u201cWe are now facing a\u2026\u2026 dual advanced energy civilization opponent!\u201dThe scholar said in a solemn tone.\u201cThe defense of the warriors is extremely amazing.\u201dThe aged scholar added: \u201cIf there are these two hundred warriors acting as protectors of the magicians, then\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe plans we made before are going to change.\u201dHearing this, everyone turned their heads.Looking at Qi who was sitting on a tall horse.It was clear to all\u00a0that the original plan\u00a0was aimed at the weakness of the magician\u2019s weak body and long chanting time.Utilizing the numerical advantage of the Great Desolate Army.Use the cavalry to attack in turns!Just get close\u00a0and the magician becomes a lamb to the slaughter!But now\u2026\u2026There were two hundred more Dou Qi warriors.Use cavalry, even heavy cavalry was not of use\u00a0to attack the warriors in Dou Qi armor.It\u00a0was just looking for death.Not to mention, there was also a magicians team of 400 people behind!\u201cAlthough the other party had 200 more warriors, but\u2026\u2026\u201dQi\u2019s eyes swept across the crowd, and an old and majestic voice slowly sounded: \u201cThe core remains the same!\u201d\u201cThe opponent\u2019s killing move is a powerful magic!\u201d\u201cWith these warriors alone.\u201d\u201cIt is impossible to nail us.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe core of the strategy remains the same, and that is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBefore the opponent\u2019s magician finishes chanting.\u201d\u201cInterrupt them, or kill them!\u201dDespite the presence of warriors\u00a0was disrupting Qi\u2019s deployment\u00a0but Qi remained calm and thought more clearly.The opponent\u2019s weaknesses were still present.Depends on whether you can use it or not?\u201cA very powerful civilization of ordinary people.\u201dIn the battle room, Tang Qingqing was observing the situation of the Great Desolate Army.20,000 people stood in black.Everyone could see the\u00a0neat and orderly military appearance.Tang Qingqing couldn\u2019t help but sigh in admiration.\u201cAs the builder of this civilization, and the record breaker of Jiangcheng\u2019s history, Jiang Fan\u2026\u2026\u201dTang Qingqing muttered out of her mouth and said, \u201cI admit that you have the qualifications to fight me head to head.\u201d\u201cTo show respect for you.\u201d\u201cThis time\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll play all my cards!\u201dIn fact, if not for this session of the Grand competition, there was the existence of a Bu Jing Yue.Tang Qingqing would not show her cards so early.The creation of a magic civilization\u00a0in various civilizations was also considered more mature.It needed to be in order.Not to mention a genius like Tang Qingqing, who had both talent and background.The four hundred magicians created\u2026\u2026 were both powerful and knew how to fight as a team.Above the battlefield.Tang Qingqing\u2019s side, whose strength was obviously superior, did not choose to attack.Two hundred warriors came in.The first thing they did was\u2026\u2026 standing in front of four hundred magicians\u00a0and blocking all possible attacks for the Magicians!On two hundred warriors, a\u00a0series of translucent shields lit up.This was a very common and very powerful skill in the Dou Qi civilization \u2013 Dou Qi into armor!The armor transformed by the Dou Qi.It was not ordinary iron armor.Unusual arrows\u00a0were very difficult to shoot through!In addition, as long as the Dou Qi was enough.These armors would not break.\u201cVery cautious.\u201d\u201cIt was completely possible to crush the attack, but Tang Qingqing still adopted this conservative formation to avoid unnecessary casualties.\u201d\u201cOnly with this nature can you go further.\u201dInside the viewing room, seeing the two hundred warriors in formation,\u00a0the teachers couldn\u2019t help but nod their heads.Two hundred warriors\u00a0plus four hundred magicians.There was no need to chant for too long.Direct saturation attack\u00a0was enough to blast the 20,000 ordinary soldiers of the Great Desolate Army into pieces!Doing so, it would create\u00a0very long momentum.Let the audience applaud.However, there was a possibility of casualties.And now the defensive tactics was more in line with the expectations of each teacher!Two hundred warriors lined up in a semi-arc, shielding all the magicians behind it.Four hundred magicians began to chant in unison.That ethereal and mysterious chanting sound\u00a0could be heard in the ears of the Great Desolate Army.But it was like a magic flute that notifies death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rocket attack!\u201dSeeing that the giant crossbow was also ineffective.Qi gave the third order.This was the Great Desolate Army\u2019s ultimate trick\u2013 kerosene oil and rocket rain!In previous matches against Serpent Planet\u00a0and while facing the terrifying petrification of the snake-men, this tactic had played a huge role in reversing the situation!Today\u2019s battlefield was still a meadow.The Kerosene technique was much easier to implement!There were a total of 20,000 people in the arena.Oil tanks with kerosene were ready long ago.It was placed right on the rock thrower.As Qi\u2019s order was given, each stone-throwing\u00a0machine was fired as fast as possible.Putting one oil tank after another\u00a0and dropping into the opposite side.The special thin oil cans, which fell to the ground, directly broke apart.Black kerosene flowed out.Hundreds and hundreds of kerosene tanks kept coming.Let the warriors who can transform their Dou Qi into their armor,\u00a0wonder how to fight.It could only be resisted or spaced out with energy armor.In fact, Qi\u2019s purpose was for these warriors in the beginning.He knew very well\u2026\u2026As long as these warriors existed, it was simply impossible to deal with the army of magicians behind!Wow\u2026\u2026One by one, the oil tanks kept breaking up.Thick and pungent black oil\u00a0covered\u00a0the entire ground.It was the side of two hundred warriors.There were empty spaces, all with kerosene!\u201cRocket launch!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So soon?\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long to chant before it stopped?\u201d\u201cIs this going to\u2026\u2026 counterattack?\u201dInside the viewing room, everyone was puzzled.\u201cNo, you guys, look.\u201dA teacher pointed to the picture in the projection and said, \u201cThese are earth magicians, and their quick chants before\u2026\u2026 the purpose should be the fire attack tactics on Jiang Fan\u2019s side!\u201dThe person next to him suddenly realized.Magicians were also divided into various categories.The common ones were \u2013Fire, earth, wind, water, lightning,\u00a0and more!And the earth magician.As the name suggests.It could manipulate the earth element.Demonstrate earth magic.Facing the kerosene, ordinary water magicians were\u00a0useless.And earth\u00a0magicians\u00a0were\u00a0a big nemesis of kerosene.Just the next moment\u2026\u2026The ground was like a dragon turning over.Pieces of dirt rolled over, not only did it flip the burning oil on the surface to the bottom.In addition, the mud formed a long blanket.The\u00a0two hundred warriors\u00a0blocked all the rockets that came flying.They\u00a0fired those rockets\u00a0on this blanket of clay.The force was greatly reduced.The flames on the arrows were also almost completely extinguished!Since it was a low-level\u00a0magician, these twenty earth magicians soon lost their control over the clay.However\u2026\u2026Out of four hundred magicians.There were more than twenty earth magicians.Another twenty walked out\u00a0and took over the task of the previous twenty magicians.They used the same trick.Both were able to extinguish the flames on the ground\u00a0and it could stop the rockets that were constantly being fired!By the look, the number of rockets was very large.They were fired almost continuously.There was an almost constant flow.Time would always run out.But by that time, the chants of other magicians would also be completed!These earth magicians\u00a0including these warriors\u00a0did everything\u00a0to delay the chanting of the magician\u2019s troop!\u201cActually predicted Jiang Fan\u2019s fire attack tactics and made arrangements in advance. This Tang Qingqing\u2019s on-the-spot command should not be underestimated.\u201dA teacher had an admiring look on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. Jiang Fan\u2019s side can be said to have exhausted all his means, but\u2026\u2026 Tang Qingqing is still at ease.\u201d\u201cJiang Fan\u2019s cards are all out, and it also exceeds our expectations, even if it were Fang Zhenting or Wang Tianyi this time, I would be on Jiang Fan\u2019s side, but he has met a desperate opponent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really a pity. With the strength of these two people, they met so early. If they meet someone else, they should both be able to enter the semi-finals!\u201d\u201cStop talking, look, Tang Qingqing\u2019s magician army is about to finish chanting!\u201dFor a time, inside the viewing room, everyone kept their mouths shut.The sound was completely gone.There was instant silence!The silence was terrible.All eyes stared at the side of Tang Qingqing.Over three hundred magicians had already finished chanting.\u201cGod above, please witness the power of our great magic.\u201dAn old magician stepped forward.His voice was mellow and distant.It seemed to carry an aura from the gods!It was a\u00a0magical planet created by Tang Qingqing.Tang Qingqing claimed to be a god.And these magicians consider themselves servants of God.The long chant finally ended.Under the command of the old magician, more than 300 magicians\u00a0gathered out a terrifying wave of magical energy.This fluctuation\u00a0finally formed three immense fireballs!These fireballs\u00a0were not only with the element of fire.There were also bonuses of wind and thunder elements.The power was even more terrifying than the ordinary fireball!It was like a cannonball being fired.Three huge fireballs\u00a0were\u00a0shot straight towards the position of the Great Desolate Army.The speed was getting faster and faster.It was difficult to see even with the naked eye.This kind of speed had surpassed the speed of sound.The Great Desolate Army were just ordinary people, and it was impossible to resist them.The Archery team did not give up.The rain of arrows kept shooting!They were trying to shoot down these three fireballs that carried a terrifying aura.However, \u2026\u2026It was useless!The huge fireballs\u00a0directly burned all the arrows it encountered along the way.It was not affected at all.This was a fireball made of fire elements.There was also the wind element and thunder element to help.It\u00a0was not like it was physical.There was no way an ordinary arrow could block it.Crossbow arrows were more powerful than ordinary arrows\u00a0but the number was much less.There was no comparison between its speed and fireball.It was simply not touchable.In the expectant gaze of many people, three immense and terrifyingly big balls of fire flew close to the position of the Great Desolate Army!\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dIn the battle room, Tang Qingqing, who saw the shadows of the three fireballs in her eyes, said lightly.Under these three fireballs,\u00a0everything would be\u00a0destroyed!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 : Heard that you\u2019re very unbelievable? Blasted through and through! Powerful crushing!All the eyes were on three immense and destructive fireballs.It was like a meteorite from the sky.It flew over the position of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0and then\u00a0they descended!Such terrifying transcendental energy.Even many people who didn\u2019t know what magic was could also see that.Although the Great Desolate\u00a0Army was wearing armor and there were as many as 20,000 people, it was absolutely unstoppable!The venue for the match\u00a0was limited.20,000 people of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0were densely distributed in this small venue.If it was in the wild, maybe they could escape.But there was no way out!The only way was to\u00a0surrender and admit defeat!Once Jiang Fan would raise his hand to admit defeat.Then\u00a0the referee around \u2013A Level 2 Planet Master would\u00a0definitely step in and interrupt this match.Although, the three fireballs were very powerful.But in the eyes of the level 2 planet master, it was not even close to being a big deal.Jiang Fan naturally did not admit defeat\u00a0and made some observant teachers a little puzzled at this.20,000 people of the Great Desolate Army included the Transcendental Research team in the back.These three huge fireballs were enough to wash the land at once.Their faces actually did not change much.No panic could be\u00a0seen in them.They seemed to have been prepared for this.One by one, they took out a small shield that they carried with them.And raised it above their head.The huge fireball was approaching in an instant!Boom!A loud, earth-shattering voice\u00a0came out, like the movement of a meteorite hitting the ground.In the projection, a\u00a0dazzling light flickered.It was almost blinding people.Above the earth,\u00a0plants on the ground and a piece of stone were directly turned into dust by this terrifying power.The ground was cracked.Dust plus stone dust rushed to the sky.It pervaded the entire battlefield.\u201cThe army of 20,000 ordinary people\u2026\u2026 are they\u00a0all wiped out?\u201d\u201cPretty much, even if it\u2019s not a total destruction, there shouldn\u2019t be many survivors.\u201d\u201cFortunately, they were\u00a0ordinary people, and they will be easier to train. If they were\u00a0transcendent people, Jiang Fan would\u00a0directly vomit blood for the loss of this battle!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, unfortunately\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. Ordinary civilization has reached its limit.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t much discussion in the crowd watching the match at this time.Many people were feeling sorry for Jiang Fan.Although Jiang Fan\u2019s awakened planet was directly as big as 35.2 kilometers.It broke the historical record of Jiangcheng.But since the latter was converted into ordinary energy, this made many people with ordinary natural talents feel even more substituted.There were many people who supported him.\u201cNo\u2026\u2026 Look.\u201dA sharp-eyed man pointed to the image in the projection in surprise.10 people looked again,\u00a0inside the arena, the dust in the sky gradually dispersed.It revealed the situation of the Great Desolate Army underneath.To everyone\u2019s surprise,\u00a0the Great Desolate Army at this time was a little dusty\u00a0but each one was\u00a0standing unharmed.Not to mention, the whole army was wiped out.It seemed\u00a0like none of them died!After a short period of shock, the crowd was in an uproar.This was\u2026\u2026 A result that no one expected!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How\u2026\u2026 did nothing happen on Jiang Fan\u2019s side?\u201dSomeone asked.It was not just these people,\u00a0even the teachers who were leading the team were also shocked.The various methods of the Great Desolate Army before were also able to immediately analyze it.But right now,\u00a0this scene was unbelievable!There were three big fireballs condensed by more than 300 magicians.This power was something that no one had expected!Let alone an army of ordinary people.Even the Dou Qi warriors who were known for their defensive power couldn\u2019t resist it either!But a bunch of teachers who were leading the teams for many years\u00a0experienced\u00a0vicious eyes\u00a0just from the traces of the scene.They saw some clues.\u201cLook.\u201dA teacher pointed to the shield next to the Great Desolate Army in the picture.These shields seemed to have been burned by fire for a long time.It became scorched and black.\u201cIf my guess is right.\u201dThis teacher continued his analysis, \u201cThis shield should be the means that Jiang Fan\u2019s side just used to resist the fireball.\u201dAnd so it was\u00a0above the battlefield.Qi glanced at the surrounding Great Desolate Army.After seeing that no one was killed in action.They took a\u00a0huge sigh of relief.In order to deal with the opponent\u2019s possible magic wash, Qi directly used the treasure of Vibranium.In the inventory of the Xia Kingdom, after this period of continuous research, the storage capacity of Vibranium had reached 500 pounds.Three hundred pounds of which was used to craft these small shields.There was one for each person.Because the combined magic power of more than three hundred magicians could not be simulated.So,\u00a0Qi couldn\u2019t be sure either\u00a0about the Vibranium Shield.But it was effective.The scene right now\u00a0was that\u00a0Qi calmed down a little.Although there were many soldiers of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0who were shaken by the residual force from the three large fireballs.But the main power of the fireballs was still blocked by the vibranium shield!However, due to the nature of vibranium,\u00a0it\u00a0turned into a pile of blackened scrap.It couldn\u2019t be used again.Qi couldn\u2019t ask for more.\u201cThe warriors of the Great Desolate Army.\u201dQi raised his sword and shouted, \u201cAlthough the enemy is terrifying, what can they do to us! Brave, brave, brave.\u201d\u201cBrave!\u201d\u201cBrave!\u201d\u201cBrave!\u201dThe morale of the Great Desolate Army was high.One by one, they all shouted loudly.The sound vibrated high in the sky!In contrast, the four-hundred-strong magicians\u2019 army on the opposite side was\u00a0surprised and astonished.Especially the leading old magician.He could not believe his eyes!It was great magic, he couldn\u2019t believe that it failed the first time.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry.\u201dAt this time, Tang Qingqing\u2019s voice sounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 : Heard that you\u2019re very unbelievable? Blasted through and through! Powerful crushing!After a brief moment of shock, Tang Qingqing observed the whole battlefield.She also discovered the vibranium shields of the Great Desolate Army that had been turned black!Naturally, she probably guessed\u2026\u2026 the way the Great Desolate Army resisted magic.\u201cThe enemy is using the devil\u2019s weapons, but these weapons can only be used once, continue to cast magic, great magic will not fail.\u201d Tang Qingqing continued to order.\u201cUnderstood, my great God.\u201dThe old magician regained his pride.He commanded\u00a0the army of magicians behind him\u00a0and started chanting once again.Inside the viewing room, as more and more teachers analyzed.Everyone also understood\u00a0that\u00a0the Great Desolate Army was able to block three fireballs.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Jiang Fan\u2019s side to have such a shield that could resist a magic of this power!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really quite surprising, but\u2026\u2026 it looks like\u00a0this shield can only be used once, and there aren\u2019t many of them.\u201d\u201cWith such an unbelievable weapon, if there are many of them, how can we still fight?\u201d\u201cJiang Fan\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s still a pity. If it wasn\u2019t for Tang Qingqing, even if it was Fang Zhenting or Wang Tianyi, he would have won.\u201dEveryone was sighing.Even some of the teachers also had a look of regret in their eyes.To be able to withstand the full power of the magicians\u2019 army!Jiang Fan was already proud enough.Without the vibranium shields.The next big fireball attack!The Great Desolate Army couldn\u2019t back it anymore.This was the only amount of shields created by Qi.Five hundred pounds of vibranium.It was not possible to use all of them to make shields.Other weapons such as arrows had to be made!The production of the shield was a helpless move.This was a strategy developed by the Transcendental research team according to the characteristics of magicians.According to the predictions of the Transcendental Research team.Tang Qingqing\u2019s version of the Magicians\u2019 army.In the first chanting spell casting.It was bound to consume magic energy without hesitation.To gather the maximum magical power!And after the first chant of the magicians.The magic energy in the body would be consumed a lot.It required a lot\u00a0of time to restore magic power.Resulting in\u2026\u2026The second chant.It would take a longer time.Time for the first chant.The people of the research team judged.It was almost impossible for the Great Desolate Army to use this time to break down the defense of two hundred warriors.But with the longer chanting of the second time.But it gave the 20,000 Great Desolate Army a precious opportunity.The Great Desolate Army no longer had the vibranium shield.If this time could be used.One hit and you\u2019re done!The tables would be turned in this match.\u201cPrepare the cavalry! Prepare the spears! Cover the archers!\u201d Qi ordered loudly.Light and heavy cavalry on the side.Already gearing up, eager to try.This time.The entire cavalry of Xia Kingdom was activated.A total of 10,000 cavalries!Among them\u2026\u2026Three thousand were heavy cavalry.Seven thousand were light cavalry!Fully armed!\u201cAttack! Break through the enemy\u2019s position!\u201dQi pointed his long sword.The 10,000 cavalries\u00a0roared and rushed out.Between the runs.The earth trembled.This was the king of the cold weapon era!Now\u2026\u2026Standing on the transcendent battlefield.It displayed a light that belonged to them!The lancers are in the middle.They were also fast to follow up.The formation was moving forward completely!Both were aimed at \u2013 the two hundred warriors escorting the army of magicians on the opposite side.And most importantly\u2026\u2026Archery team was in the back!Archery team.By now, it had been reloaded with brand new arrows!These arrows.All made of vibranium!Due to the preciousness of vibranium.They couldn\u2019t touch it normally.Now\u2026\u2026And it poured out!All the vibranium in the Xia Kingdom.All were\u00a0made into arrows!More than that.Just to be sure.The biological weapon \u201cCrimson lion\u2019s Blood\u201d was activated!The Transcendental Research Institute\u2019s research on the Crimson lion\u2019s blood was still ongoing.There were no complete results.Qi could not care less.Pulled it straight into use.The arrowheads of these arrows.It was not just an alloy made of vibranium.Above it\u2026\u2026It was even coated with the blood of Crimson!Swish!Swish!Swish!The cavalry had not arrived yet.The rain of arrows came first.Thousands of arrows.It covered the whole sky and the earth and fell down like a blanket with overwhelming power.Continuing to fall on the Dou Qi armor on the body of the two hundred warriors!Seeing that the Great Desolate Army did not use the most powerful giant crossbow.On Tang Qingqing\u2019s side.Neither did the earth magician make a move.One of the disadvantages of low-level magicians was that\u2026\u2026Although the magic power released was powerful, it would also consume a lot of magic power.After each release.They all had to take a break.So that the magic power in the body could be restored.It was not yet possible to make unlimited use of it.Click!Click!Click!Continually, the Dou Qi armors were broken.Just when the soldiers wanted to reunite their armor.They were shocked to discover that\u2026\u2026Dou Qi.It seemed to be absorbed by something.Surprisingly, it was reduced by a lot out of thin air.As more and more arrows descended.The Dou Qi energy on the body surface became less and less.This time.Even if these warriors were not as smart as the magicians.They still realized.It\u2019s these arrows that were the problem!It seemed that\u2026\u2026Able to absorb their Dou Qi?Vibranium alloy on the arrow.Could absorb energy.And the blood of the Crimson lion.It was able to dissolve energy.The Dou Qi armor on the body of two hundred warriors.At a rate visible to the naked eye, it quickly broke inch by inch.The thickness was continuously weakened.But arrows kept coming one after another.There was no chance for these warriors to breathe at all!Level one warrior.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 : Heard that you\u2019re very unbelievable? Blasted through and through! Powerful crushing!The Dou Qi in the body was also limited.If this goes on it would be all used up sooner or later.How powerful were the\u00a0warriors without transcendent power?The people of the Transcendent Research team had already come to this conclusion.They were stronger than ordinary people\u00a0but their strength was limited.At least\u2026\u2026It was absolutely impossible to be an opponent of cavalry!The\u00a0terrifying impact of the heavy cavalry was especially impossible\u00a0for a transcendent body to withstand.\u201cMagicians, get ready.\u201dTang Qingqing, who saw that something was wrong on the soldier\u2019s side, immediately ordered.Let the earth magician take action again.Twenty Earth Magicians stepped forward first.After a short chant, they released earth magic one after another like before.Immediately, the earth on the surface rolled over again\u00a0and formed\u00a0a long blanket of earth, protecting the two hundred warriors in the front.It\u00a0blocked the rain of arrows for them.Crackling!Most of the arrows landed on this carpet.Vibranium could absorb energy\u00a0but this was the earth element.Vibranium was also helpless.At this time, the cavalry had arrived!The black\u00a0mass of 10,000 people in the cavalry\u00a0raised\u00a0up the swords in their hands.They came crashing down.Seeing this huge carpet, there was no fear at all.The speed of the warhorse kept going, and it even\u2026\u2026 rushed over directly.Right after that!Sword swing down!What shocked everyone was\u00a0that several hundred cavalrymen swung down their war swords.It actually made this earth carpet\u2026\u2026 dissolve in an instant!It broke into several pieces in the middle and fell to the ground.The power of the blood of the crimson lion was clearly evident at this moment.Even the bones of transcendent species could be melted.After breaking the earth blanket, the cavalry\u2019s attack did not stop.It continued to dash out.The people in the Transcendental Research team had done a comparison.The object of comparison was the most powerful cavalry and the low-level Transcendent of the Xia Kingdom at present!It was no exaggeration to say.Even martial artists couldn\u2019t block the cavalry either\u2026\u2026 Especially the attack of the heavy cavalry!Especially after the number of\u00a0people in\u00a0cavalry came in the thousands, the tremendous impact was quite amazing.Even if the warriors were stronger than the martial artist, they were also strongly limited but at the lower levels.While facing the swarming heavy cavalry, these warriors were still on the defensive!The Great Desolate\u00a0Cavalry did not give them the slightest courtesy.There was no fear either\u00a0and they killed them directly.Click click click\u2026\u2026There was a constant sound of shattering of Dou Qi armor.As for the arrows, only the leading arrows contained vibranium and crimson blood.The entire machete of these cavalrymen was made of vibranium alloy.The entire blade\u00a0was\u00a0coated with Crimson lion\u2019s blood.Their damage was much greater than the arrows.There were five hundred pounds of vibranium.Qi suppressed the heartache and moved all of them to create shields, arrows and war swords\u00a0for this operation.Chi chi chi\u2026\u2026Dou Qi energy was rapidly depleting.A part of it was absorbed.A part of it was dissolved.Two hundred warriors\u00a0were horrified to find out.There were just ordinary people on the other side.But the sword went down.It was even more terrifying than a martial artist\u2019s slash.Their Dou Qi\u2026\u2026It actually decreased a lot in an instant!Once the Dou Qi armor broke.Then\u2026\u2026Even if they were transcendents of an intermediate civilization.It was also dangerous!The Great Desolate Army did not expect to encounter Dou Qi warriors here.There was no prior experience in dealing with warriors.But against martial artists.There were already a lot of strategies.The seemingly chaotic 10,000 cavalry was\u00a0not\u00a0aimlessly rushing around.There was also a small detachment.These small detachments\u00a0were that each was responsible for one warrior.Surrounding the warrior, they kept swinging their swords.They were depleting the Dou Qi on the surface of the body.Without the Dou Qi armor what awaited\u00a0this warrior was death!Poof!A soft sound was heard.Captain of a small team\u00a0inserted the sword into the heart of a warrior that consumed all the energy of Dou Qi!He stabbed the warrior in the heart.Even if it was transcendent, he died on the spot.So far\u00a0in this battle, the first casualty appeared!What everyone didn\u2019t expect was that.It was not an ordinary person from Jiang Fan\u2019s side.Instead, \u2026\u2026The warrior who once amazed everyone by turning his Dou Qi into armor!Squads interspersed\u00a0and killed\u00a0into the formation of two hundred warriors.They were strictly following the orders.The warriors were divided and surrounded.Followed by a kill!\u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dThere were constant screams of misery.Warriors were constantly being harvested by cavalry!As predicted by the Transcendental Research team, a warrior\u00a0whose Dou Qi was depleted and empty was just lunging at high speed in front of the Great Desolate Army.It\u00a0was just like the lambs to the slaughter!In the meantime, there were also warriors who suddenly burst into action.They were taking advantage of the last bit of Dou Qi energy\u00a0to make a counterattack.The Great Desolate Army naturally suffered casualties.This was the same as what Qi and Jiang Fan expected.On the battlefield, how could there be no casualties?There was only bloodshed.It\u00a0was what makes the fastest progress for an army!Seeing a warrior actually being slaughtered in this way, Tang Qingqing couldn\u2019t sit still any longer.She directly stood up\u00a0and\u00a0said, \u201cMagicians, prepare to strike and kill these cavalrymen!\u201dTang Qingqing\u2019s face was still not flustered.Behind two hundred warriors, there were still four hundred magicians standing.To release magic with more power, these magicians were just chanting.But now, it must also stop.Although for low-level magicians, powerful magic required a long time to chant.But against these cavalrymen, ordinary magic was enough!It\u00a0was just that\u2026\u2026What Tang Qingqing did not realize was that\u00a0there was no longer the protection of the warriors\u00a0for the magician group.The weak and unquestionable magician had already been secretly targeted by the Great Desolate Army!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 : Blasting and crushing the subjugation! Powerful promotion! I fight against the heavens!With the assault of 10,000 soldiers of cavalry of the Great Desolate Army, the Situation\u00a0above the battlefield suddenly turned around!It was too fast for the people who\u00a0were watching the battle.Two hundred dou qi warriors\u00a0and the Dou qi armor on the body surface seemed to be the same as paper.It was cut to pieces by the swords in the hands of ordinary soldiers!In the end,\u00a0the\u00a0warrior who had lost the protection of his dou qi armor\u00a0was surrounded by a small group of ten horsemen.He was struggling a little at most.In the end, he was killed by the sword.What made Jiang Fan a little surprised was that\u00a0the casualties of the Great Desolate Army were certainly there\u00a0but the number was very small.Jiang Fan looked at it for a few moments\u00a0and the reason was soon discovered.These warriors were transcendents\u00a0but they had only just been born.They spent all the time cultivating Dou Qi and improving the realm.For combat skills, there was basically no practice\u00a0and not to mention the fighting skills.The Great Desolate Army, on the other hand, was just the opposite.After several years of practical exercises, every move and stance was a killing method.Warriors without Dou Qi was like 1VS1 against great\u00a0desolate soldiers.At\u00a0the end, who would win and who would lose was\u00a0not easy to say yet.Four hundred magicians also lacked spell casting skills.They were not so proficient in the use of magic.If they were given some more time to grow,\u00a0then\u00a0the pressure on the Great Desolate Army would increase geometrically!But there were no more ifs.Ten thousand cavalrymen of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0would not give these people a chance at all.Seeing that the situation was not so good,\u00a0Tang Qingqing directly dispatched one hundred of the four hundred magicians\u00a0to attack\u00a0and help the warriors to reduce the pressure.There were earth, water, wind, fire, and a few more rare ice types magicians!She sent all types of magicians.After a short chanting, a\u00a0small fireball, a\u00a0water arrow, and a gust\u00a0of wind were shot.After the water arrows were shot, the instant freezing spell of the ice magicians was\u00a0shot!One hundred magicians fired together!The scene was quite spectacular.It was like a hurricane.It landed on the cavalry of the Great Desolation Army that was surrounding the warriors!Bang!A Great Desolate soldier was hit by a fireball.The entire body flew backward\u00a0violently.They\u00a0fell heavily to the ground\u00a0for a while\u00a0but then they got up again.A trace of blood seeped out of the corner of their\u00a0mouths.They were\u00a0injured\u00a0but there was no major damage!\u201cWe\u00a0can still fight.\u201dThe soldier rejected the captain\u2019s offer to be replaced.They\u00a0yelled\u00a0and immediately re-entered the battlefield.The attacks of a hundred magicians put a lot of pressure on the cavalry of the Great Desolate Army.It\u00a0was just that\u00a0they didn\u2019t notice the archery team in the back.They aimed for the target at this time.Swish!Swish!Swish!The archery team once again showed their power.Arrows swooped straight at the army of magicians!But the old magician was ready.He lightly waved his right hand.The wind magicians on both sides began to chant.A few moments later, a\u00a0gust of wind\u00a0appeared over the army of magicians!The arrows shot out by the Great Desolate Army\u00a0encountered these gusts of wind.The speed and force were diminished\u00a0and most critically,\u00a0the direction was directly straight.And so on through these gusts, most of the arrows were deflected to the side.A very few arrows no longer had a high speed.It was very easily avoided by the magicians.Click!An arrow was caught by the aged wizard, and then\u2026\u2026 snapped!\u201cStupid mortals.\u201dThe aged wizard looked at the Great Desolate Army and his old voice rang out saying, \u201cHow dare you to provoke the great magicians, God will make you pay the price of destruction.\u201dIt had to be said\u00a0that Tang Qingqing\u2019s belief in this planet was very successful.The faith in God was very deep!Originally in the absence of two hundred warriors, the teachers\u00a0were more optimistic about Tang Qingqing\u2019s side.The main reason was\u00a0that hundreds\u00a0of magicians\u00a0were\u00a0too over the top.No one could stop them.In general, there could be two hundred magicians.It was already more than enough.However, the number that Tang Qingqing built was more than double!The collocation of various magicians made the battle power more than double.While resisting the arrow rain of the archery team, they did not forget to support the warriors in the front.Water wizards were very good at short range combat.A stream of water arrows\u00a0was\u00a0condensed directly out of thin air.It was fired towards the cavalry of the Great Desolate Army, which was not far away.It was faster than normal arrows.One point faster!\u201cGet off your horse!\u201dThe Great Desolate Army was prepared for this.Strategies had also been devised to target them.Qi and the Transcendental\u00a0Research team\u00a0responded to the match.Several simulations were made in advance.They were simulating all kinds of situations that might occur during the battle.In addition, to the appearance of two hundred dou qi warriors, there was nothing unexpected.Everything was almost the same as the simulation!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 : Blasting and crushing the subjugation! Powerful promotion! I fight against the heavens!All the\u00a0cavalrymen jumped off their horses\u00a0and hid behind the horse.They were using war horses as obstacles\u00a0to fend off the magician\u2019s attack!A stream of water arrows\u00a0launched out.Naturally, it could not change the direction.All arrows were shot at the war horses.The Great Desolate Army rushed over.They had already thought about that, so\u00a0the action was very fast.The position of the war horses was also very particular.Under the impact of water arrows, war horses\u00a0hissed.With that, they\u00a0fell heavily to the ground.A maximum of 100 attacks were issued at a time by 100 magicians.The 10,000 soldiers in the cavalry of the Great Desolate Army were\u00a0strong.As for the war horses, they were\u00a0more than enough.There were more than 10,000 horses\u00a0and there were more in store, as a\u00a0backup!The dismounted soldiers of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0were fighting directly with the surrounding warriors.This time, more than twenty warriors had fallen out of two hundred warriors\u00a0but there were\u00a0still more\u00a0powerful warriors left.The Great Desolate Army had no intention of going head-to-head with the warriors.If it was a horse fight, they would still have dared to give it a try by relying on the impact of the war horses at high speed.But when it comes to the ground, fighting recklessly with warriors who had dou qi\u00a0was like\u00a0looking for death!They mainly dealt with warriors with little dou qi.Then\u00a0they were left to the heavy cavalry, who were still on their horses.Both sides divided work.Collaboration was very consistent!First, they focused on attacking the warriors on the left, draining the dou qi of the warriors on the left.When it was almost depleted, they would be slashed to death\u00a0because two hundred warriors had to protect the magicians behind them.There was no order from Tang Qingqing.The warriors on the right who were not attacked much\u00a0did not dare to act rashly.They could only watch the companions on the left.In fact, if the magicians in the back could provide support in time, then\u00a0the warriors on the left would also be fine.It would not be easy either for the Great Desolate Cavalry.But no one expected that the battle swords of the Great Desolate Cavalry were made of vibranium alloy\u00a0and they were coated with the blood of Crimson Lion!The warriors on the right were waiting for\u00a0Tang Qingqing to\u00a0react.It was already too late.The left side of the warrior\u2019s dou qi was\u00a0almost depleted\u00a0and the Great Desolate Army cavalry blocked the magician\u2019s attack with their war horses.Ten men got off the horse\u00a0and\u00a0surrounded one warrior\u00a0like a jackal catching its prey.They were constantly harassing them looking for the right time\u00a0to deliver the killing blow.At this time, the warriors on the right were still staying put.They had to protect their backs.They had to wait until these three hundred magicians would\u00a0finish chanting.The terrifying magic\u00a0power would come again!No matter how many soldiers were on the battlefield\u00a0and how many cavalrymen, all of them\u00a0would be wiped out in an instant!This\u00a0time, the warriors on the right were able to come out to help.There was still a chance to turn the situation back\u00a0but\u00a0Tang Qingqing did not realize this.He didn\u2019t\u00a0order the warriors on the right to help.They were still putting hope\u00a0in these three hundred magicians.This was a\u00a0bad decision.There\u00a0was no chance for this match to turn around!The other cavalry that was a bit further away\u00a0didn\u2019t wait for the battle on the left to end and rushed up.Their target was the warriors on the right!It was the same as before against the warriors on the left, arrows rain first, with cavalry behind!Tang Qingqing seemed to have reacted a little at this time.He ordered\u00a0a\u00a0hundred wizards in the back to step in to help.One after another fireballs, water arrows, and strong winds rushed toward\u00a0the cavalry.It\u00a0was just that\u00a0the situation was completely different from just now.The cavalry on the left\u00a0scampered straight back on the horses.After there was no more interference from a hundred magicians they bypassed the battlefield that was being fiercely fought.They were going straight to the 100 magicians behind.\u201cWatch out.\u201dTang Qingqing immediately shouted.One hundred magicians\u00a0also noticed the cavalry on the left.They immediately stopped supporting the warriors on the right\u00a0and rushed to chant and cast the spell.Low-level magicians were as weak as ordinary people.If they were approached by cavalry,\u00a0that would be\u00a0a one-sided slaughter!The Great Desolate Army cavalry on the right was all under pressure!They started dashing forward!Before reaching the warrior formation on the right,\u00a0a\u00a0steady rain of arrows\u00a0came and most of the dou qi on the body of these warriors had\u00a0been consumed!Bang!A cavalryman burst\u00a0in\u00a0and raised\u00a0the battle sword.It was a fierce battle with a warrior!The cavalryman was thrown out heavily\u00a0but the warrior wasn\u2019t much better either.He underestimated the impact of high-speed cavalry.Just this hit directly depleted the little Dou Qi energy left in his body!Poof!The blood was flying!A head was thrown into the air.The cavalry followed\u00a0behind\u00a0directly slashed\u00a0and cut this warrior\u2019s head off!The same scene kept happening around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 : Blasting and crushing the subjugation! Powerful promotion! I fight against the heavens!The cavalry of the Great Desolate Army was completely unconcerned with life and death.That was the desperate general style.At the cost of dozens of lives\u00a0and at the cost of hundreds of injuries, the formation of the warriors on the right was completely cut through by the cavalry of the Great Desolate Army!It was a\u00a0sudden breakthrough!There were\u00a0a total of one hundred warriors on the right\u00a0but after the cavalry of the Great Desolate Army broke through the bottom line.There were less than forty left.More than sixty warriors fought\u00a0head-to-head\u00a0and were killed by the cavalry of the Great Desolate Army!The remaining thirty or so warriors were also injured.There wasn\u2019t much dou qi left.\u201cGeneral attack! End the battle!\u201dSeeing this scene.Qi knew that the end of the match had come.The Great Desolate Army had one more big threat.That would be\u2026\u2026Three hundred magicians behind the warriors who were about to finish chanting!It must be done before the chant would be\u00a0finished.End this battle!They placed jars on\u00a0a stone throwing machine\u00a0but these jars were\u00a0not filled with kerosene.The kerosene was not very useful against magicians.Fire magicians were even able to use their superior mastery of the fire element\u00a0to bring the burning fire under control!Not to mention, there were also water and earth magicians on the opposite side.All were the nemesis of fire attack tactics!These jars were filled with \u2013 the blood of Crimson Lion!Almost all the stock of Crimson lion\u2019s blood in the Xia Kingdom was there!To win the competition, one could say that\u00a0Qi went all out.If the competition could be won\u00a0even if the Xia Kingdom went back decades, Qi would be happy to do so!He knew very well\u00a0that with Father Jiang Fan,\u00a0the Xia Kingdom didn\u2019t have to worry about development issues at all.Each jar, under the projectile of the stone thrower,\u00a0drew a long arc in the air.Subsequently, it landed on the position of the army of magicians.The magicians below noticed the jars.Wind magicians stepped forward\u00a0immediately.One after another, wind blades quickly condensed.They were cutting\u00a0these jars one by one.But the purpose of Qi was precisely this.If the jar broke, the blood of the crimson lion inside would fall down.Seeing that there was no kerosene in the jar\u00a0but it was crimson blood,\u00a0all the magicians froze for a moment.Then they rushed to avoid it.But there were still some magicians who had been infected.In an instant.Chi chi chi\u2026\u2026The sound of clothes and skin being severely corroded sounded!With an \u201cah\u201d scream.The bodies of these magicians quickly dissolved away.The rest of the other magicians watched with horror!The magicians who were chanting also had to move\u00a0to avoid this\u00a0terrifying crimson blood.The reason Qi launched the Crimson Lion\u2019s blood was not to kill magicians.Instead, \u2026\u2026Interfere with the chanting of these magicians.It was well known that\u00a0when the magician chants, calmness was required.Once the body was moved, the chanting was not interrupted\u00a0but it would greatly affect the efficiency of chanting!Crimson Lion\u2019s blood was used to buy precious time for the cavalry fighting in the front!If there were 200 warriors ahead,\u00a0then the projection of this\u00a0crimson lion blood\u00a0would\u00a0bound warriors to join the magicians.It was intercepted from the air\u00a0but now\u00a0the warriors could not even protect themselves.They could only watch the jars fly\u00a0over their heads, one by one!The fight between the Great Desolate Army cavalry and the two hundred warriors continued!Each had casualties\u00a0but the purpose of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0was not to destroy these warriors.From the beginning, the strategy developed by Qi was to kill the army of magicians behind the warriors!These magicians were\u00a0the real threat of the Great Desolate Army!After dozens of people fell, the remaining warriors couldn\u2019t help but show a hint of fear.Who was not afraid of death?This was true even for transcendents.Out of 10,000 cavalrymen\u00a0now there\u00a0were eight thousand of them.Besieging these surviving warriors, they did not proceed.And these warriors\u00a0faced\u00a0the black mass of cavalry.Naturally, it was impossible to take the initiative to attack.Everyone on both sides knew that it was a competition, not a real war.With a silent agreement, the Great Desolate Army cavalry and the remaining 100 or so warriors\u00a0were confronting each other.But again, they didn\u2019t do anything to each other.The remaining two thousand cavalrymen\u00a0reached\u00a0straight to the four hundred magicians behind!In turn, the warrior\u2019s eyes were wide open.Until this time, inside the viewing room, Tang Qingqing just realized that\u2026\u2026You might be losing?She was going to lose!Losing in this match!The Great Desolate Army was not like the other transcendent races.When it first appeared, it was overwhelming.It was more like a dull knife cutting through flesh.Wait until the end,\u00a0others would only find out.Originally\u2026\u2026This seemingly insignificant dull knife was actually so powerful!It was like a person whose usual grades were always one of the best.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 : Blasting and crushing the subjugation! Powerful promotion! I fight against the heavens!Tang Qingqing only felt a blackness in front of her eyes.The sky was spinning\u00a0and it would fall directly to the ground if the right hand did not happen to be propped up on the chair.She bit her lip tightly.She was still looking at the battlefield in disbelief!Looking at the battlefield, Tang Qingqing still hadn\u2019t lost at this point!Three hundred magicians had reached the second half of their chanting.The chanting was not finished\u00a0but it was also interrupted midway.The magical power that would be released now\u00a0would be greatly reduced because of this!But it was also powerful.If these spells hit them face to face,\u00a0two thousand cavalrymen\u00a0would definitely not be able to withstand it!However\u2026\u2026It was also only possible to kill these two thousand cavalrymen.There were still more than 10,000 soldiers left of the Great Desolate Army!While\u00a0for the army of magicians, there was no third chance of chanting!Of course, they could still fight\u00a0but it would only cause\u00a0more casualties!The two thousand soldiers on the battlefield could pounce in front of four hundred magicians\u00a0but they didn\u2019t do it.They were just sitting on a tall horse\u00a0and were looking down at these magicians from a high position.Although all the magicians were proud,\u00a0they were not stupid either.If they dared to release magic\u00a0then\u00a0what awaited\u00a0them must be the roaring anger of the Great Desolate Army.This was a competition,\u00a0not a war!It would only decide\u00a0the winners and losers.Inside the viewing room, the silence was terrifying!Before\u00a0that, there was still a lot of chatter.They were amazed at how terrifying the magicians\u2019 army was.Some people were even\u00a0predicting the next round of competition!Many teachers were also very relaxed\u00a0and they were talking eloquently to the people around\u00a0and wanted\u00a0to use this match to teach the other students some knowledge!However\u2026\u2026Over time, their voices gradually ceased.Everyone\u2019s eyes were fixed on the projection.Their mouths were\u00a0slightly opened.They were unable to say anything for a long time!Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei both stood up suddenly when they saw\u00a0that two thousand cavalrymen\u00a0were breaking through the warrior\u2019s defenses\u00a0and reached in front of the four hundred magicians.This time, everyone could see that\u00a0the defeat of Tang Qingqing\u2019s side had been decided!It was only a matter of time before she would admit defeat.What was left was probably a desperate death struggle!\u201cAdmit defeat, sister.\u201dAccompanied by school leaders and teachers, Tang Yushu sighed and said, \u201cThis time\u2026\u2026 you really lost.\u201dIn the battle room, Tang Qingqing naturally couldn\u2019t hear Tang Yushu\u2019s words during the competition\u00a0because it was completely isolated from the outside world.After a long time,\u00a0Tang Qingqing\u2019s voice sounded: \u201cI admit defeat!\u201dA white flag was hung above the battlefield!None of the\u00a0four hundred magicians\u00a0lost their lives.But the originally proud face lost all its brilliance!In front of the Great Desolate Army, their faith and pride were all shattered inch by inch!\u201cWin!\u201dThe Great Desolate Army embraced each other.They were celebrating this hard-earned victory.The Transcendental Research Team was also crying with joy!Since the Great Desolate Army participated in the competition, this battle\u00a0was the most difficult.It was also the first time there was a loss.\u201cWin!\u201dQi slowly clenched his fist and looked to the sky.\u201cWell done.\u201dJiang Fan smiled faintly\u00a0and complimented his heart.The Great Desert Army won this match in detail.Without Qi working overtime to study and simulate in advance, this battle was going to be a lot tougher.Even if he could win in the end, there would also be a huge price to pay!From the beginning to the end, all\u00a0of the commands were very critical.Every step of the Great Desolate Army was all about the final destination.Interlocked!Even if there was a detail not thought out or not done properly.Then\u2026\u2026It was hard to say the outcome of the latter!When Tang Qingqing\u2019s voice of admitting defeat sounded\u00a0inside the viewing room.After a brief moment of silence, there was an outburst.There were unprecedented shouts!Jiang Fan won!\u201cHahaha, as expected of my favorite player, he actually defeated Tang Qingqing!\u201d\u201cAwesome, it\u2019s too awesome!\u201d\u201cI heard that you are a dual-energy civilization? It\u2019s against the heavens? So what? Hit me hard!\u201d\u201cThe great ordinary civilization is magnificent! Who just said that ordinary human civilization has come to this point is already the limit, there is no future, come forward to me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve decided that I\u2019ll be a big fan of Jiang Fan from now on!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say before that you were a big fan of Lu Tao?\u201d\u201cNo way, the development of things is always moving forward and constantly changing.\u201d\u201cThis match was a real twist, it was so good, I can\u2019t wait for Jiang Fan\u2019s next match!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very close to the top four! I\u2019m afraid no one expected that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe viewing room was like a vegetable market at the moment.It was boiling violently.There\u00a0was\u00a0a heated discussion.A\u00a0bunch of teachers next to them\u00a0were silent.This match simply refreshed their world view.If you count the most shocking matches in your mind.Then\u2026\u2026Even after many years, the first thing most teachers would think of was this one!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 : The final match! It\u2019s finally here! Jiang Fan vs Bu Jing Yue!Even though the match was over,\u00a0many people were still watching the replay of the match in the projection\u00a0inside the viewing room.There was a constant and lively discussion.It could be said that\u00a0this match included almost all of the ignition points!Both sides used the Trump\u00a0cards one after another of their own means\u00a0and finally, the weak side\u00a0won!This match was unforgettable!The quality of the match was also very high.\u201cHow many years has it been since we\u2019ve seen this kind of competition?\u201dAn older teacher was the first to speak up.Most people could only see that\u00a0this match between Jiang Fan and Tang Qingqing was very nice.They found it very\u00a0impressive.But\u00a0a bunch of teachers\u00a0saw more than that!They didn\u2019t need to say anything about Tang Qingqing.Most teachers thought that if she was placed in most of the previous competitions, she could be an indisputable candidate\u00a0for all the championships.Everyone believed that Jiang Fan, who defeated Tang Qingqing, was naturally stronger.One could say, this quarter-final battle was comparable to the final of any previous Grand competition.Even\u2026\u2026And beyond!Another middle-aged teacher responded: \u201cThe last time I remember, a match of this quality.\u201d\u201cIt goes back twenty years to the final of the competition\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe battle between Yang Tianwen from No. 1 Middle School and Mo Zhan from Jin Yao Middle School.\u201d\u201cIt is estimated that it can be compared to today\u2019s battle!\u201d\u201cIt can be said that this year\u2019s three people, Bu Jing Yue, Jiang Fan and Tang Qing Qing.\u201d\u201cIn any previous competition, they could win the championship.\u201d\u201cThis year\u2019s session is indeed\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe strongest geniuses in Jiangcheng\u2019s history!\u201dHearing this, there were originally some teachers who were controversial about it.At this point, they also had to agree.Seeing the demon-level\u00a0performance of Jiang Fan and Tang Qingqing, there was not a single person now who would not acknowledge this fact.One teacher said,\u201cIn this match, Tang Qingqing lost because of the details.\u201dAnother teacher nodded in agreement.\u201cYes, Jiang Fan\u2019s details were much better than Tang Qingqing\u2019s.\u201dAs the saying goes, outsiders watch the fun\u00a0while the insiders see the doorway.These leading teachers had sharp eyes.They were watching the replays of match projections.Soon\u2026\u2026It revealed a lot of things that they hadn\u2019t noticed before.\u201cTang Qingqing actually had some chances, but Jiang Fan\u2019s side did it too perfectly!\u201d\u201cFrom start to end, there were very few mistakes.\u201d\u201cTheir vision and strategy were\u00a0great.\u201dIn a very appreciative tone, a teacher said, \u201cJiang Fan\u2019s side could see at a glance that there was only one threat from Tang Qingqing, and that was the army of four hundred magicians!\u201d\u201cAnd Jiang Fan\u2019s series of measures was\u00a0completely aimed at this.\u201d\u201cEven the cavalry, who appeared to be dealing with warriors\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe real purpose was also to solve the threat of magicians!\u201d\u201cAnd Tang Qingqing\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t notice this at first, but when she noticed it later, it was already\u2026\u2026 too late!\u201dAll the teachers were talking about this.The key to the match was quickly and completely analyzed.Inside the lounge,\u00a0Tang Qingqing came here with her head down after the match.She was looking at Tang Yushu in front of her.She shouted softly, \u201cBrother.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to lose.\u201dTang Yushu looked at Tang Qingqing and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve lost well.\u201d\u201cNext time, I will win it back!\u201dTang Qingqing bit her lips and said with some dissatisfaction.\u201cWin it back?\u201dTang Yushu couldn\u2019t help laughing and said, \u201cDo you know where you lost today?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dTang Qingqing thought for a moment and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Jiang Fan to have so many tricks up his sleeve.\u201d\u201cNo no.\u201dTang Yushu shook his head gently and said, \u201cIt seems that you didn\u2019t realize the real problem.\u201d\u201cI told you before to give it your best, but you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStill too careless.\u201d\u201cYou think going all out is as simple as having all your cards out?\u201dTang Yushu looked at Tang Qingqing, sighed and said, \u201cAfter watching the video of this match several times, you will know that if Jiang Fan was going all out, then\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u00a0were not even a tenth of what he\u00a0was prepared for!\u201d\u201cThis match\u00a0was all under his control\u00a0from start to end!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have any respect for your opponent at all.\u201d\u201cI guess\u2026\u2026 you didn\u2019t even watch the video of the opponent\u2019s matches.\u201dTang Qingqing couldn\u2019t help lowering her head\u00a0when she heard that.Indeed, as Tang Yushu said,\u00a0she only chose to watch the videos of\u00a0those two matches of the elimination round.Then\u00a0she skimmed through it roughly.It didn\u2019t take much time at all.Not to mention\u00a0the research on the Great Desolate Army now.In contrast, Jiang Fan\u2019s side was well prepared.\u201cWhen you showed the trump card of Dou Qi, you would be thinking that it was the greatest respect for your\u00a0opponent.\u201dTang Yushu\u2019s voice became slightly stern, and he continued: \u201cAnd today\u2019s match has taught you a very good lesson!\u201d\u201cIn front of an opponent with a record-breaking diameter of the awakened planet, you\u2019re actually still so neglectful?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to lose now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better than failing your college entrance exams!\u201d\u201cBrother, I know.\u201dTang Qingqing bit her lip lightly, clenched her right fist slightly and said, \u201cIn the college entrance examination, I\u2026\u2026 will not fail again!\u201dWith the end of this match between Tang Qingqing and Jiang Fan, all eight battles also came to an end.All four qualified players were out\u2013Jiang Fan from No. 7 Middle School!Bu Jing Yue from No. 1 middle school!Fang Zhenting from No.3 Middle School!Lu Tao from No. 2 Middle School!These four were all super-geniuses\u00a0with

popularity skyrocketed!Now his fame was not weaker than Fang Zhenting and Lu Tao!Even\u2026\u2026Some people had already ranked Jiang Fan\u2019s position ahead of Lu Tao and Fang Zhenting!The matchup

Jiang Fan even defeated Tang Qingqing, so Lu Tao shouldn\u2019t be a match for him either!\u201d\u201cWhen you put it that way, there\u2019s really\u2026\u2026 nothing to see here.\u201dThe battle between geniuses was exciting\u00a0but it was not as controversial as it was before.The reason was\u00a0that everyone was very aware of that.Among these four, Bu Jing Yue and Jiang Fan\u2019s strength was clearly better.Lu Tao and Fang Zhenting were similar in strength.Their strength was lower than the two of them!In everyone\u2019s predictions\u00a0Jiang Fan would win this match.\u201cHumph, although Jiang Fan defeated Tang Qingqing, he will have to ask me first before entering the final.\u201dIn the aisle, Lu Tao, who was walking towards the lounge, listened to the discussions around him.A trace of fighting spirit flashed in his eyes!\u201cTang Qingqing\u2019s dual energy civilization was terrifying but I\u2019m not afraid, who wins and who loses will only be known after a fight.\u201dAs Lu Tao walked, he thought: \u201cJiang Fan\u2019s army is of ordinary people. Those rockets, giant crossbows, cavalry and other means, the race I created is not afraid of them at all.\u201d\u201cIn this battle\u2026\u2026 I want to let everyone know that I, Lu Tao, am the only one other than Bu Jing Yue\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOne of the strongest!\u201dThe semi final battle was also divided into two sessions.The first session\u00a0was\u2026\u2026The match between Bu Jing Yue and Fang Zhen Ting\u00a0was after the big battle between Tang Qingqing and Jiang Fan.Although there were very\u00a0few people watching it,\u00a0each one\u2019s mind was completely out of the match.The suspense for this\u00a0match was soon lost.Fang Zhenting also created an advanced civilization.An advanced race that was not much weaker than the magicians.But in front of the immortal cultivators of Bu Jing Yue!It was not even close.After barely struggling for thirty minutes, Fang Zhenting \u201cdecently\u201d chose to admit defeat!The second match was between Jiang Fan and Lu Tao!In this match, many people would\u00a0pay attention.Since the scene between Jiang Fan and Tang Qingqing, Jiang Fan\u2019s fan girls and fanboys seemed to pop out of the ground in an instant.It was explosive growth!The support was overwhelming.It was not just the onlookers, there were also teachers who were leading the team.Because of Jiang Fan\u2019s excellent on-the-spot command, they paid special attention to Jiang Fan!But what these people didn\u2019t know was, on the spot command had nothing to do with Jiang Fan.Jiang Fan was just like a VIP audience.He was leaning back against the soft back of the chair in the battle room.He was quietly watching the Great Desolate Army defeating one opponent after another!The match would start soon.Naturally, Jiang Fan had already sent the videos of Lu Tao\u2019s matches\u00a0to Qi.What Lu Tao awakened was also an advanced energy planet.What was created was an extremely rare race of advanced civilization \u2013Rock monster!The talent of this race\u2026\u2026Naturally, it was easy to think.It\u00a0was\u00a0their solid skin and flesh!Their entire body was made up of rock.They were very tough.In the previous quarter final match, Lu Tao and Wang Tianyi\u2019s showdown, the two were of equal strength.Lu Tao had the last laugh.The biggest reason was their\u00a0abnormal defense, stamina and resistance!Normal arrows shooting at rock monsters were\u00a0like hitting a rock.It was useless.The power of the giant crossbow was much greater, but it couldn\u2019t pierce the rock monster!As for the kerosene Technique and cavalry attacks were\u00a0more like tickling the rock monster.That\u00a0was the reason that even if Jiang Fan defeated Tang Qingqing, Lu Tao still had the confidence to beat Jiang Fan\u2019s trump card!\u201cIf Tang Qingqing was the one who advanced, then I\u2019ll have to worry about it. But Jiang Fan, your ordinary people\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at the situation on the field, Lu Tao couldn\u2019t help grinning, thinking to himself, \u201cThe rock monsters I cultivated are really not afraid at all!\u201dUnfortunately\u2026\u2026 Lu Tao was facing more than just the Great Desolate Army.There was still a Transcendental Research team in the back.In the eyes of the Transcendental Research team, as long as it was a creature,\u00a0it must have its weaknesses.It depends on whether they could find it or not.The weaknesses of the rock monster\u2026\u2026It was very obvious\u00a0that their speed was not fast.But on the battlefield, these weaknesses could be well masked!And the biggest weakness\u2026\u2026The Transcendental Research team had\u00a0developed a program to address this.They droped kerosene tanks and rockets first.Let the heat rise to the surface of the rock monster.And then\u2026\u2026Then they threw ordinary water tanks.Let the temperature cool down.With a mix of hot and cold, rock monsters would become more crunchy!But this was no ordinary rock.This method\u00a0was only for rock monsters.It didn\u2019t help much at all.And the purpose of the Great Desolate Army was not to kill the rock monster by this.This time.The \u201cInescapable Net\u201d created by Qi\u2019s people entered the arena!It would not only reduce the defence of\u00a0the crunchy rock monsters.In addition, it would\u00a0become more difficult for it to turn around and move.All 10,000 cavalry of the Great Desolate Army were deployed.Lu Tao had a total of 500 rock monsters.Cavalry of ten thousand soldiers\u00a0were divided into five hundred squads.Every twenty cavalries\u00a0surrounded the rock monsters.They were shooting the arrows!The arrow could break into the crunchy rock monster.It was nailed on the rock monster.Then they used the net to cover these rock monsters.They trapped the\u00a0rock monsters inside!As\u00a0these rock monsters had difficulty moving, they immediately pulled out the arrows\u00a0and injected the blood of the crimson lions into it.There was only a small amount of crimson blood left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 : The final match! It\u2019s finally here! Jiang Fan vs Bu Jing Yue!All of it was injected into the bodies of these rock monsters.Just like the blast method, dozens of holes were shot on the body surface of the rock monster.Then they used the blood of the crimson lion to corrode and enlarge these small holes!Dozens of holes\u00a0were gradually expanding!At the same time, the kerosene technique and the water tanks kept adding\u00a0to make sure that the rock monster become\u00a0crisp!By the end, the action of the giant crossbow had arrived.A giant crossbow\u00a0was shot into\u00a0these dense holes.There was a click sound\u00a0and the\u00a0rock monster broke.The body surface was actually cracked!Not all cracked\u00a0but the approach was proven.It was very effective.It gave the Great Desolate Army enough time.The giant crossbow would\u00a0tear apart the bodies of these rock monsters little by little!\u201cI admit defeat!\u201dSeeing this scene, Lu Tao in the battle room resolutely admitted defeat.A hint of complexity flashed in his eyes.Originally, he was still not convinced by other people\u2019s comments.But now, he also had to admit\u00a0that Jiang Fan was indeed much stronger than himself!So far, the semi-finals were over.None of the two matches took much time.It was over soon.The two people who entered the final were also out.No surprise\u2013Bu Jing Yue and\u2026\u2026 Jiang Fan, who no one had thought of before the competition won!\u201cWin!\u201d\u201cIt was quite easy.\u201d\u201cHaha, Jiang Fan is indeed a master of command on the spot. He can even think of such exquisite tactics!\u201d\u201cProceed to the finals! How magnificent is my ordinary civilization!\u201d\u201cHere it comes, here it comes, the long-awaited final is finally here!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dInside the viewing room, those who supported Jiang Fan were excited.\u201cIt\u2019s the final.\u201dTong Zhensheng was very happy!As the principal of the No. 7 middle school, even if he held the position for decades,\u00a0there were very few opportunities to witness one\u2019s students participate in the finals!The No. 7 middle school was not like the No. 1 and No. 2 middle schools which were the top middle schools.Both of them were able to fight in the quarterfinals.It was not easy at all.This year was the best grade in the history of the No. 7 Middle\u00a0School!A total of two students entered the quarterfinals.And now\u2026\u2026Jiang Fan even made it to the finals with a stunning display of strength!\u201cPrincipal Tong, Teacher Qiu, congratulations.\u201dCongratulations sounded.Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei turned their heads to look.They could not help but stare.It was not someone else\u00a0but Lan Hao, the lead teacher of the No. 1 middle school.After being ridiculed by Qiu Yunfei earlier, Lan Hao disappeared for a while.Now, he finally found the opportunity to appear again.He looked at the two with a smile on his\u00a0face and said, \u201cWith the momentum of Jiang Fan, a student of your school, I am afraid that winning this championship is a sure thing. I want to congratulate you in advance.\u201dShady!Qiu Yunfei couldn\u2019t help but spit out a sentence in his heart.\u201cIt\u2019s enough to make it to the finals, which can be compared with the genius of your No. 1 middle school.\u201dTong Zhensheng was unconcerned and said indifferently.\u201cYeah.\u201dLan Hao nodded and said, \u201cIn the past, No. 7 High School entered the finals twice, and both times\u00a0it won the second position. This time, even if Jiang Fan accidentally loses, it is still the best result of No. 7 High School in the past!\u201dHearing this, a\u00a0sharp light emerged faintly in the eyes of Tong Zhen Sheng.Qiu Yunfei, on the other hand, clenched his fist.In the previous Jiangcheng competitions, No. 7 middle school made it to the finals twice.It all happened during the tenure of Tong Zhensheng.But those two times\u2026\u2026The students of No. 7 Middle School all lost to the genius of No. 1 Middle School!Lan Hao deliberately brought this up.The mockery was totally obvious!For both losses, Tong Zhen Sheng had always felt very sorry.As the old saying goes, it only takes three times.If this time, Jiang Fan once again fell to the feet of the player of the No. 1 middle school in the final.Then\u2026\u2026This matter would become Tong Zhensheng\u2019s inner demon!\u201cLan Hao, this time Jiang Fan has won twice in a row against the geniuses of your No. 1 Middle School, so it\u2019s worth it.\u201dQiu Yunfei said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, we will be the final champion.\u201dLan Hao smiled faintly.\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dQiu Yunfei had a faint trace of anger in his eyes\u00a0but he also knew that\u00a0Lan Hao was so confident.The reason was\u00a0that Bu Jing Yue was too much of a demon!Earlier, even if Tang Qingqing showed her trump card \u2013 two hundred Dou Qi warriors.Many teachers also felt sorry for her.Thinking that if it was any previous session, Tang Qingqing was likely to take the championship.But this time\u00a0she encountered a monster in a monster.There was no hope at all!It was not just the lead teachers, everyone watching the battle.There was also some disappointment about this upcoming final.\u201cWhat a pity, Jiang Fan. If it was any other year, he would have been the champion.\u201d\u201cNo way, Bu Jing Yue awakened a super-civilization planet and created immortal cultivators, no one can beat it.\u201d\u201cFortunately, this is just a big competition, and losing is not so difficult to accept!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see, maybe Jiang Fan can even give us an extra surprise!\u201d\u201cI believe that Jiang Fan must have more surprising means, but\u2026\u2026 in front of immortal cultivators, it seems to be of little use.\u201d\u201cAt least make some suspense out of it, don\u2019t be one-sided.\u201dOne by one, the discussion was not too intense, all of them\u00a0were making suggestions for Jiang Fan.Or simply sighing in dismay.Just like the national football team of the previous life.Before the last match, the probability of qualifying was only 0.01%.With the consistent nature of the national football team.This probability could actually be omitted and ignored!In the eyes of people who were not so expectant.The live broadcast projection was re-opened.The final of the Jiangcheng competition \u2014It was finally here!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 : The Power of Technology! Shock the audience! The shiver of the immortal cultivators!The final was not as anticipated as the battle between Jiang Fan and Tang Qingqing earlier\u00a0but there was an unprecedented high level of attention!Even the lord of Jiangcheng came here in the middle of a busy day\u00a0to watch this match.\u201cCity Lord.\u201d\u201cCity Lord.\u201d\u201cCity Lord.\u201dOne by one, teachers and leaders were respectfully shouting.The city lord of Jiangcheng nodded slightly, then looked at the projection and asked, \u201cWhich two schools\u2019 geniuses entered the finals?\u201d\u201cCity Lord.\u201dThe leader of the nearest school immediately answered: \u201cThe two outstanding students from No. 1 Middle School and No. 7 High School entered the finals.\u201d\u201cNo. 1 Middle School and No. 7 Middle School?\u201dThe city lord of Jiangcheng said: \u201cI know that from the No. 1 middle school, it should be the girl Jing Yue. Who is from the No. 7 middle school? Tang Qingqing?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe school leader explained: \u201cAn excellent student named Jiang Fan from No. 7 Middle School.\u201d\u201cJiang Fan?\u201dThe city lord of Jiangcheng thought for a while and said, \u201cIt seems that this name is familiar.\u201d\u201cJiang Fan, the student who broke our Jiangcheng record when he awakened the planet.\u201dThis school leader explained.\u201cSo it\u2019s him.\u201dThe City Lord of Jiangcheng came to a sudden realization, and then asked in confusion, \u201cI remember that, didn\u2019t this Jiang Fan awaken an ordinary civilization?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ordinary human civilization, but\u2026\u2026\u201dThe school leader continued to explain, \u201cJiang Fan\u2019s awakened planet is probably very large in diameter, and many ordinary people were born. With the advantage in numbers, Jiang Fan defeated the others, including Tang Qingqing, and entered the finals.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dThe city lord of Jiangcheng nodded slightly.For all the geniuses in Jiangcheng, as a city lord, he\u00a0was only slightly concerned.He won\u2019t pay too much attention either.After all, a\u00a0genius who hadn\u2019t grown up would always be just a genius.Not to mention\u00a0Jiangcheng City Lord back then,\u00a0he was also the strongest genius in his time!Every \u2013 year.He had personally witnessed one genius after another.In all these years,\u00a0he didn\u2019t know how many geniuses came and went.But to be able to get to his point, there were only a few!If not for the fact that the Grand Competition was held by the City Lord\u2019s Office.This final match wouldn\u2019t have raised much interest in him.\u201cThis final, it is estimated that the girl Jing Yue will win it!\u201dJiangcheng City Lord said.\u201cIt should be no surprise.\u201dThe school leader agreed: \u201cJiang Fan is not bad, but he is definitely not Bu Jing Yue\u2019s opponent.\u201d\u201cThe super-energy planet awakened by Bu Jing Yue has created a civilization of immortal cultivators. Everyone on the planet is an immortal cultivator, it is\u00a0not comparable to others.\u201d\u201cI also heard that Bu Jing Yue built a very rare race in the civilization of immortal cultivation, and it is more powerful than the ordinary civilization of immortal cultivation!\u201d\u201cPreviously, every match of Bu Jing Yue was very easy, and it is said to have left the bottom card.\u201d\u201cThe only suspense in this battle is\u2026\u2026 to see if Jiang Fan can force out Bu Jing Yue\u2019s trump card!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing that there was an opening, teachers and leaders flocked together one by one.They had spoken in front of the Jiangcheng City Lord.\u201cBu Jing Yue is one of the most demonic among the many geniuses in the history of our Jiangcheng.\u201dJiangcheng City Lord said, \u201cIt\u2019s normal for Jiang Fan to lose in her hands.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s watch the match.\u201dSoon, the competition officially started.Due to the presence of the City Lord of Jiangcheng\u00a0plus there really wasn\u2019t much suspense in this game.The murmur of the crowd was almost non-existent.\u201cThe toughest battle ever.\u201dIn the battle room, Jiang Fan observed the situation on the battlefield and couldn\u2019t help but sigh.This was a big competition.It was really hard for Qi.He was getting old.Now he was full of gray hair.No\u00a0trace of black hair could be seen at all.The eyes were bloodshot\u00a0due to less than five hours of sleep every day!But mentally, he still had a trace of\u2026\u2026 unprecedented fighting spirit!Especially after reaching the final.In the Qi\u2019s body, the fighting spirit seemed to be on fire.For the final,\u00a0Qi made all the preparations and arrangements he could think of!Qi\u00a0and the Transcendental Research team\u00a0studied\u00a0video footage of the matches of Bu Jing Yue\u00a0over and over again!The mobilized Great Desolate Army reached 30,000 people.Also known as\u2026\u2026All of the Great Desolate Army.This time they all made an appearance.Qi also wanted to draw more people up, but there was nothing to be done.The battlefield was so big, no one expected that earlier\u00a0that in the\u00a0planet that had\u00a0just awakened a month ago\u00a0had\u00a0actually tens of thousands of people!But seeing so many people, none of them thought that Jiang Fan\u2019s side had more chances to win either.It was well known that\u00a0Bu Jing Yue in the previous matches didn\u2019t exactly shown her full strength.The road could be said to be crushed over!Even against Lin Qiangfei and Fang Zhenting.It was also by virtue of these powers displayed, she defeated the two of them with ease!No wonder, the crowd was in agreement.Even Tang Qingqing, who had awakened dual energy was no\u00a0match for Bu Jing Yue.Super civilization compared to advanced civilization could almost be considered a qualitative leap!It was stronger than a little bit!After the debut of the Great Desolate Army, the immortal cultivators cultivated by Bu Jing Yue also entered.This was a team of 500 people!Each one looked like a human.But as compared to humans, there was an ethereal aura on their body.The skin was very white.Especially those eyes\u00a0were giving a sense of aura!\u201cXiu Ling Clan!\u201dJiang Fan slowly spit out these three words.What Bu Jing Yue created was not an ordinary immortal cultivator.In the immortal civilization, it was an extremely rare, and extremely powerful race \u2013 the Xiu Ling!This race\u00a0was the most powerful.All of them had innate spiritual bodies.In other words, even if the Xiu Ling Clan didn\u2019t need to train specially.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 : The Power of Technology! Shock the audience! The shiver of the immortal cultivators!It would also automatically absorb the aura between heaven and earth all the time.Over time, their strength would automatically increase!If cultivated, that would be even faster!This was also just one of the talents of the Xiu Ling clan.And others were very scary talents!All kinds of talents were added up.Let the Xiu Ling clan\u00a0be recognized as an extremely powerful race in the immortal cultivation civilization!Five hundred Xiu Ling clan people.Although it was not much,\u00a0it was scary enough.On most Xiu Ling people, Jiang Fan saw a familiar thing \u2013Bows and arrows!This was also a talent of the Xiu Ling clan.They were very close to nature, and were good at archery!They were rumored to be in the jungle.There were not many races\u00a0who dared to fight against the Xiu Ling people!But it was different from the bows and arrows of the Great Desolate Army.These bows and arrows were all made of wood, and they were even more small and exquisite!The material used seems to be some kind of material from a transcendental plant!Arrows were also made of wood.Again, the material looked transcendental.Although it did not contain metals if anyone takes this bow and arrow lightly.That would be a big mistake!The power of this bow and arrow had been vividly displayed by the Xiu Ling people\u00a0in the previous matches!Lin Qiang\u00a0Fei and Fang Zhenting were two talents.All were defeated by such a powerful bow and arrow!\u201cThere are several kinds of arrows of Xiu Ling people.\u201dQi was having final deliberations with the Transcendental Research Team.\u201cThe most powerful one is comparable to our giant crossbow.\u201d\u201cThe ordinary arrows are more powerful and faster than our bows and arrows!\u201d\u201cAlmost\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s comparable to the fastest speed of our sound-absorbing arrows!\u201d\u201cAnd, most crucially\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Xiu Ling people\u2019s archery skills are extremely superb!\u201d\u201cIt can be said to be a hundred shots. It\u2019s almost impossible to miss, even for the other Transcendent people.\u201d\u201cIf our soldiers are targeted by them, they basically can\u2019t escape.\u201dThe elderly scholar was speaking slowly.The more he said, the frown on the next one gets tighter!Fang Zhenting was also a super-genius\u00a0with an awakened planet with a diameter of more than 30 kilometers.The difference between the diameter of the planet and that of Bu Jing Yue was not much\u00a0but he was still crushed!The main reason was that\u2026\u2026They were completely unable to block the bow and arrow strikes of the Xiu Ling!The first round of arrows was shot and 100 soldiers of the Great Desolate Army were down.How could they\u00a0still play this match?Even Tang Qingqing\u2019s dou qi warrior and Lu Tao\u2019s rock monster\u00a0had more defensive power.They should be able to withstand a round\u00a0but they definitely could not stop the second round of shooting!\u201cBut we have one big advantage!\u201dThe old scholar glanced at everyone, and then said: \u201cThat is, we have a lot of people! We have 30,000 soldiers!\u201d\u201cAnd the arrows of the Xiu Ling people!\u201d\u201cAlthough the power and accuracy are great, it can only hit one person at a time!\u201dQi nodded slightly.If the arrows of the Xiu Ling people were group injuries.Then\u2026\u2026This match might be pointless.\u201cBut archery is only the most obvious killer move of the Xiu Ling people.\u201dThe aged scholar continued, saying, \u201cWithout the use of bows and arrows, they are very powerful in battle themselves.\u201d\u201cAccording to the classification of transcendent civilizations.\u201d\u201cImmortal cultivation civilization is the most powerful category in almost all civilizations!\u201d\u201cImmortal cultivators of the same level are more powerful than martial artists, magicians, etc.!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s just these Xiu Ling people.\u201d\u201cIt is also difficult for the other side to gain the upper hand.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy guess is that the other side will definitely play the so-called bottom card!\u201dThe voice just fell, then a burst of sound was heard from the opposite side.The crowd looked away.After seeing the five hundred Xiu Ling people on the other side.The passage did not close.Instead, \u2026\u2026Two more behemoths came out of it!Seeing these two behemoths appear not only\u00a0the Great Desolate Army\u00a0but everyone in the viewing room\u00a0couldn\u2019t help but murmur in amazement.\u201cOh my! Bu Jing Yue\u2019s bottom card is actually this?\u201d\u201cThe Xiu Ling clan is already over the line, she actually came to this, do you want people to live?\u201d\u201cThe tree man, the spirit tree man! How could Bu Jing Yue raise such a thing?\u201dOne by one, they were amazed.\u201cOn a first-level planet, being able to cultivate a spirit tree person is indeed a monster-like talent.\u201dA teacher couldn\u2019t help but praise.\u201cEven if it is an immortal civilization and a first-level planet, the probability of a spirit tree person appearing is extremely low.\u201dAnother teacher continued, \u201cThe fact that Bu Jing Yue was actually able to cultivate it means that her talent\u2026\u2026 is still above our guesses!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough to rival those top geniuses in the province!\u201dThe teacher was very sure.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of super-geniuses.\u201dJiangcheng City Lord opened his mouth and said, \u201cThis Bu Jing Yue, is indeed one of the most outstanding ones, and the future is unlimited!\u201d\u201cI still need to thank Jiang Fan. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I\u2019m afraid we wouldn\u2019t have been able to see how powerful Bu Jing Yue is.\u201dA teacher said with a smile.\u201cI have to thank Jiang Fan, according to the gossip I heard.\u201dAnother young teacher lowered his voice and said, \u201cThis time, Bu Jing Yue had not planned to come to the big competition.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause at the awakening, she broke the record first and was subsequently overtaken by Jiang Fan, so\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBu Jing Yue only participated in this grand competition to redeem her glory!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s even such a thing?\u201d\u201cCome on, tell us the details.\u201dOne by one, teachers still couldn\u2019t help but gossip.Inside the arena, two behemoths walked in.These were two huge trees that were twenty meters tall and as much as five meters wide!It\u00a0was just that.It was not the same as ordinary tree\u00a0people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 : The Power of Technology! Shock the audience! The shiver of the immortal cultivators!Instead, they had two big hands!There were also a pair of big wooden eyes!To be exact, they were tree people!A giant spirit tree man!It was a\u00a0very rare type of life.It could only be born in a civilization of immortal cultivation!Qi and the Transcendental Research team couldn\u2019t help but stare in disbelief!\u201cIs this the\u2026\u2026 tree class of transcendents?\u201dOne scholar asked speculatively.\u201cSpiritual tree people, the product of immortal cultivation civilization.\u201dThis time, Jiang Fan used air oscillation\u00a0to pass the sound to Qi.There was no way\u00a0of the sudden appearance of spirit tree people.Qi and the research team didn\u2019t understand it at all.There was also no way to find out.This tree man was rare\u00a0but the information could also be found online.Jiang Fan then used voice transmission to pass this information to Qi.\u201cThis is the Spirit Tree People, an intelligent creature of the immortal cultivation civilization.\u201dQi opened his mouth and said.The people who were talking next to him stopped at once.Each of them was used to it.Qi\u2019s knowledge of this was as open as it was popular.The more shocking video projections before\u00a0were\u00a0all accepted.Not to mention this.At this moment,\u00a0the people of the Transcendental Research team\u00a0were even more convinced.Behind Qi, there really was a deity out there!\u201cI will write down their relevant information, and you will study it immediately.\u201dQi said as he picked up his pen.He wrote directly and quickly.He copied\u00a0everything he\u00a0just heard.Soon, the members of the research team had seen the true face of the tree man!\u201cIt\u2019s not a tree spirit, its own race is a tree person, with feet and legs?\u201d\u201cPowerful and gentle by nature, a natural good friend and companion of the Xiu Ling people?\u201d\u201cOn\u00a0a first-level\u00a0planet, the spirit tree people belong to one of the most powerful races that can be cultivated?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at them one by one, all of them\u00a0were slightly surprised!Following this\u00a0content, the spiritual tree man was simply superlative!Even if there were only two trees on the opposite side,\u00a0they could hardly think of any way to deal with it!\u201cThe opposite side is moving!\u201dA general shouted.Qi hurriedly saw that the two-spirit\u00a0tree people were walking in front of the 500 Xiu Ling people.They were slowly moving forward.While looking at the Great Desolate Army, they pressed forward.Five hundred Xiu Ling clansmen then followed behind the spirit tree people.Following along!\u201cOpposite\u2026\u2026 this is to use the spirit tree people to block our attacks, then get close and then finish us off?\u201dOne scholar immediately speculated.\u201cThat should be the case.\u201dThe old scholar nodded and said, \u201cIf they shoot bows and arrows, their number of arrows is definitely not enough.\u201d\u201cInstead of consuming arrows for nothing,\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are directly using\u00a0the high defense of the spirit tree people.\u201d\u201cThey are waiting until they\u00a0get close and then deal with our soldiers!\u201dOnce in close quarters, many of the great weapons of the Great Desolate Army would lose\u00a0their usefulness.For example, arrow rain, kerosene, giant crossbow and so on!\u201cWe can\u2019t let them get close!\u201dQi made a decisive decision, glanced around, and shouted: \u201cThe heavy cavalry attack, go around behind them, and attack the Xiu Ling people!\u201d\u201cArchery team, get ready and cover the cavalry!\u201d\u201cThe giant crossbows, get ready and prepare the kerosene!\u201d\u201cThe team that can deal with these two Spirit Tree people will get double contribution points after the battle!\u201dWith a command from Qi, all the teams moved fast!But this way, it also disrupted the previous deployment of the Great Desolate Army!Previous deployments\u00a0all revolved around dealing with the Xiu Ling people.No one expected that\u00a0Bu Jing Yue actually had a superlative like the Spirit Tree Man!Now\u2026\u2026Only a temporary change of strategy was possible.In short, absolutely no Xiu Ling people should be allowed to close in.Once they were in close combat!Even if it was a 30,000-strong Great Desolate Army.There was also little chance of winning.Besides\u2026\u2026On this\u00a0small battlefield, even 30,000 people couldn\u2019t strike at the same time!They were not playing the biggest role!Swish!Swish!Swish!The archery team took the lead.The arrows rushed towards the spirit tree man in a black way.There were spirit tree people up to 20 meters tall blocking the front.The Xiu Ling people in the back couldn\u2019t shoot at all.All of the arrows were blocked by the spirit tree people.Pffffffff\u2026\u2026An arrow shot at the spirit tree man.It was only slightly sunk in.Thousands of arrows\u00a0were shot but most of it was blocked by the dense foliage.The rest\u00a0were densely nailed to the trunk and branches of the spirit tree man.Then the crowd was surprised to see\u2026\u2026 the huge body of the Spirit Tree Man gently shaking.These arrows were like beans.Being all shaken off!The spirit tree people were\u00a0not affected at all.They kept\u00a0moving at a slow pace!\u201cChange to rockets!\u201dSeeing that normal arrows were useless against spirit tree people.Qi immediately thought of the rocket.At the same time,\u00a0kerosene tanks were also placed on the stone thrower one by one\u00a0and took the lead in projects.It landed on the giant tree\u00a0and shattered\u00a0apart.The kerosene inside flowed down\u00a0and was dripping down the branches and trunks of the trees!Then the archery team\u2019s rockets\u00a0were\u00a0shot!As the kerosene touched the rocket, it blazed immediately.chi chi chi\u2026\u2026The branches and leaves on the spirit tree man were also set on fire.It was burning fast.\u201cFire attack works!\u201dSeeing this scene, the Transcendental Research team was all excited!However, in the next moment, they just couldn\u2019t stop laughing.Only to see\u2026\u2026The five hundred Xiu Ling people behind the spirit tree people.At this time, a few beautiful women walked out.Each held a translucent, jade-like thing in each hand.These beautiful women\u00a0threw the translucent jade token at the spirit tree man.Immediately, the speed at which the flames spread, slowed down to the naked eye!!!Previous Chapter<All

    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 : The ultimate killing weapon! The trembling Xiu Ling people!\u201cSpiritual talisman!?\u201d\u201cIt should be the spirit talisman, which is made by the Xiu Ling people to condense the essence of heaven and earth, with all kinds of incredible abilities!\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be, didn\u2019t Bu Jing Yue just awaken the planet a month ago? How could there be this thing?\u201d\u201cSpiritual Talisman! The probability of this thing appearing on a first-level planet is even rarer than that of a spirit tree person!\u201d\u201cThe spirit tree people are somewhat afraid of fire, but with the spirit talisman in place, the fire attack will be useless at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing the translucent jade token thrown out by the Xiu Ling clan.Everyone was surprised\u00a0inside the viewing room.\u201cThe immortal cultivation civilization created by Bu Jing Yue has only been around for a short time, but the structure is already perfect, and it can attack and defend, with basically no shortcomings.\u201d\u201cYeah, this kind of genius with no weaknesses, will go further in the future.\u201dTeachers, including the City Lord of Jiangcheng, were also sighing.They lived for dozens of years\u00a0and had seen too many geniuses\u00a0in the Jiangcheng Grand Competition.Every session had at least one super genius\u00a0but the ones that really ended up being able to grow were\u00a0not much.Some genius cultivated races\u00a0that\u00a0were\u00a0strong at first.For example, the offense was very strong\u00a0but when it came to the defense, it\u00a0was\u00a0easy to be targeted!The less the weakness of the race, the more sustainable the development of planetary civilization would be!This was also why the Xiu Ling Race was recognized as an extremely powerful race!It was because\u2026\u2026The Xiu Ling clan had both offense and defense!Their talent tree was almost full.Basically, there was no weakness.Under the effect of the spiritual talisman the raging flame of the spirit tree man\u00a0had already decreased.Finally\u2026\u2026 disappeared into thin air!\u201cHow many\u2026\u2026 jade tiles did the other party use? Was it\u00a0actually able to put out the fire?\u201dOn the side of the Great Desolate Army, the people in the Transcendental Research team found it unbelievable.\u201cThis should be a means of immortal cultivation civilization.\u201dThe elderly scholar\u2019s face was less tense, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so afraid when you figure out how it works!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even if it\u2019s an Immortal Cultivation civilization, all sorts of methods have their basis.\u201dAs the other scholars\u00a0heard that,\u00a0their spirit was lifted again one by one!\u201cContinue to act according to the original plan!\u201dQi was sitting on a high horse, the body was straight, and the face was calm.\u201cI figured it out!\u201dAfter a short time, a scholar observing with binoculars exclaimed, \u201cThe jade sign on the opposite side is using the principle of absorbing air and thus extinguishing the fire.\u201d\u201cNot by other means!?\u201d\u201cCan that kind of jade token absorb air?\u201dQi slightly pondered and then said: \u201cThe fire must continue, the number of such jade items should not be more, and\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have to create opportunities for the cavalry assault!\u201dThere were three thousand people in the\u00a0heavy cavalry.It was already on the move!The archery team did not stop!This time, there were also many arrows with the blood of the Crimson Lions\u00a0amidst the rain of arrows.As a result of the match with Tang Qingqing, crimson lion\u2019s blood and vibranium were consumed very much.So\u2026\u2026The remaining amount could not be supported\u00a0for too long.It could only be used with ordinary arrows.Chi, Chi, Chi,\u2026\u2026The arrows with the blood of the \u00a0Crimson Lions shot at the Spirit Tree Man, emitting a sound of corrosion!It\u00a0was just that\u2026\u2026It also dissolved just a bit of the surface.Some of the arrows were directly set aside by the great hand of the spirit tree man!For the spirit tree people with amazing defense and strong recovery power, this little injury\u00a0was not even a big deal!There was no effect\u00a0at all and they continued to steadily move toward the Great Desolate Army!At the same time, three thousand heavy cavalry came around behind the spirit tree man.They were fiercely rushing forward\u00a0to the 500 Xiu Ling people!\u201cFortunately, these two spirit tree people should still be young, and not fast enough, otherwise\u2026\u2026 it would be difficult.\u201dThe elderly scholar breathed a sigh of relief!The spiritual tree people were tough\u00a0but like the rock monster before, it also had the disadvantage of being slow to move.Turning\u00a0around\u00a0was especially not\u00a0easy!The heavy cavalry came directly around behind them.Let the spirit tree people have no way at all.Boom!A wooden arrow shot over!One of the five hundred Xiu Ling clansmen drew a bow and shot an arrow!An arrow was shot at the heavy cavalry.A \u201cBoom\u201d sound came!There was no suspense, the first cavalry could not even dodge.It was also hard to resist with the sword in hand.It was shot directly into two halves.Seeing this scene, the companions in the back\u00a0had\u00a0no point of fear, but the eyes flashed a trace of more intense war intent!So what if they were\u00a0immortals!Today\u2026\u2026They\u00a0wanted to take advantage of their\u00a0immortal cultivators!The rumbling of the horses\u2019 hooves.Three thousand people of the heavy cavalry\u00a0charged fiercely like a torrent.Swish Swish Swish\u2026\u2026The Xiu Ling people kept drawing their bows and shooting arrows.Same as the findings of the Transcendental Research team.The Xiu Ling people were all natural archery masters!The soldiers of the Great Desolate Army were constantly getting hit by arrows and falling off their horses!Qi watched all of this in silence.This was, since the formation of the heavy cavalry.For the first time, there were so many casualties.But\u2026\u2026An army couldn\u2019t grow without bloodshed.That\u00a0was the price one must pay for a strong military!The battle continued\u00a0and the heavy cavalry charged without fear!It was getting closer and closer to the opposite side.The heavy cavalry was three thousand people.The Xiu Ling people didn\u2019t have so many arrows.Soon, an elderly Xiu Ling blew a sound like a whistle.Five hundred Xiu Ling people\u00a0jumped in place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 : The ultimate killing weapon! The trembling Xiu Ling people!They jumped directly onto the branch of the Spirit Tree Man!They were looking down at the Great Desolate Army from above.Such a high position\u00a0plus there were spirit tree people on guard.The heavy cavalry could only stop under the trees.Some of them helplessly looked at the Xiu Ling clan in the tree.As for climbing the tree?If the brain was not rusty, it was impossible to come up with such an idea.Xiu Ling clan\u00a0jumped gently. they could jump so high.On individual force alone, these Xiu Ling people far surpassed the Great Desolate Army.The Great Desolate Army was relying on the impact of heavy cavalry.Because of this they\u00a0dared to rush over to fight!If it was infantry, they would\u00a0definitely be\u00a0slaughtered!In terms of individual strength alone.The Xiu Ling people were also the strongest individuals the Great Desolate Army had seen so far!This was still under the premise that the opponent did\u00a0not use a bow and arrow.Above the battlefield,\u00a0there was no movement.The Great Desolate Army was caught in an awkward situation where there was nothing to do!Jiang Fan watched quietly.This was somewhat similar to the battle with Tang Qingqing.But in that battle, Tang Qingqing\u2019s main defense force was the warriors!It was completely incomparable to these two spirit trees in front of them!The warriors were at least able to fight head-on.While\u00a0these Xiu Ling people\u00a0dodged towards the spirit tree man.The Great Desolate Army couldn\u2019t even reach them!The rain of arrows continued.They were trying to slow down the advance of the two spirit tree people.The heavy cavalry didn\u2019t stay idle either\u00a0and started thinking of all kinds of tricks!For example\u2026\u2026Throwing hooks, throwing hardened concealed weapons, harassing with bows and arrows\u2026\u2026 Trying to do everything they could!\u201cArrow rain, fire attack, giant crossbows, cavalry, and the blood that contains a very strong corrosive\u2026\u2026 Jiang Fan\u2019s side seemd\u00a0to have used all the means, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, all of these were used in front, or in the Tang Qingqing\u2019s \u2013 battle!\u201d\u201cThese means were indeed terrifying, Tang Qingqing\u2019s dual army of magicians and warriors couldn\u2019t even stop it, but I didn\u2019t expect that against Bu Jing Yue, it\u2019s actually not even enough of a threat.\u201d\u201cAny more tricks? If not, just admit defeat, it\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\u201cThe key is the two huge spiritual trees. If you don\u2019t solve the spiritual tree, all methods will be useless.\u201d\u201cThese two spirit tree people are too superlative, just like cheating, do you guys think Tang Qingqing\u2019s magician army is useful against these two spirit tree people?\u201d\u201cIt should work, but at most the spirit tree people will be a little wounded and\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you take the Xiu Ling people as an audience? With the spirit talisman in place, even powerful magic will be greatly weakened!\u201dGetting to this point, inside the viewing room, almost everyone could see that\u00a0the Great Desolate Army\u2019s side did its best.From the very beginning, they used all methods and not spared lives.They let the heavy cavalry charge at the Xiu Ling Clan.As a result\u2026\u2026The effect was minimal.It could be said that it did not work at all.The two spirit tree people carried five hundred Xiu Ling clansmen and slowly walked towards the position of the Great Desolate Army.They were getting closer!More than 20,000 people of the Great Desert Army\u00a0clenched the weapon in their hand!At the moment when the two spirit tree people arrived in front of the army shield formation.Qi took a deep breath and said, seemingly somewhat helplessly, \u201cRetreat!\u201dIf the spirit tree people were allowed to rush in, there was no need for the Xiu Ling race to attack.With the wide hands of the spiritual tree man, a\u00a0single slap could kill several soldiers of the Great Desolate Army.A command was given\u00a0after the giant shield formation.The five thousand soldiers of the spear formation retreated backwards at once.Only a giant shield was left still in place.Finally, the former huge spirit tree man reached\u00a0in front of the giant shield.Four large hands gently sweep down.It directly swept\u00a0away these huge iron shields.These huge iron shields were two meters high.They were thick and heavy.It took two soldiers of the Great Desolate Army to move it together.In addition, it was still rooted in the earth.But in the hands of these two spirit tree people it was as if it was made of paper.That terrifying power was intimidating!\u201cF*ck! What is there to fight for? It\u2019s too much. Relying on these two Spiritual Tree Men\u2026\u2026 No, just one tree is enough. Who can beat this competition?\u201dInside the viewing room, a\u00a0fanboy who supported Jiang Fan muttered in both surprise and helplessness.\u201cNo one should be able to beat it, I guess there is a little hope for Tang Qingqing\u2019s magician\u2019s army.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Tang Qingqing\u2019s magic army. Don\u2019t you know? Apart from the Spirit Tree people\u2019s strong defense, they also have abnormal recovery power. With a bit of damage, they are\u00a0able to recover quickly!\u201dWhen all giant shields were cleared\u00a0they were shaking their heads one by one.Just as the two spirit tree men were preparing to\u00a0step forward.On the the trunk of the tree,\u00a0an older Xiu Ling clan member suddenly spoke up and said, \u201cStop.\u201dHearing this, the two spirit tree people were a little confused\u00a0but still slowed to a halt.Elderly Xiu Ling clan member was standing\u00a0in the branches and was looking down from above.The other Xiu Ling clansmen next to them were also watching carefully.As an immortal cultivation race, Xiu Ling people whether vision, smell or touch, etc were\u00a0much stronger than ordinary people.If it developed later, there would also be something as powerful as spiritual awareness!After watching for a while, the older Xiu Ling clansman suddenly removed a bow and arrow that he was carrying behind him.He drew the bow and shot the arrow!The arrow was like a meteor!The direction of the strike was not the Great Desolate Army!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 : The ultimate killing weapon! The trembling Xiu Ling people!Instead, it\u00a0was the ground behind the giant shield!Boom!This arrow shot at\u00a0the ground\u00a0and made a direct\u00a0and violent sound.A surprising scene emerged.This piece of ground\u00a0was like paper\u00a0under the tremendous force of this arrow.In fact, it cracked directly inch by inch.It collapsed\u00a0and converted into dust.The older Xiu Ling clan member frowned slightly\u00a0and\u00a0waved his hand\u00a0immediately.A few Xiu Ling clansmen beside him took out their bows and arrows.A stream of arrows was fired in unison.Separate shots were fired on the ground behind the giant shield.The ground seemed unable to withstand the powerful impact of the arrow\u00a0with a few loud noises.It actually caved in one after another.The ground\u00a0collapsed.The lancers stood on their feet\u00a0waiting for the dusty diffusion to gradually dissipate.Everyone saw that.A huge hole actually appeared\u00a0in that area!Below the ground, at the location where\u00a0the arrows were shot by the Xiu Ling people, it was a big deep hole!In other words, the surface of the ground just now was only a thin layer.If the spirit tree people stepped on it\u00a0carelessly, they\u00a0would probably fall into this hole.It\u2019s\u00a0a trap!The first thing that came to everyone\u2019s mind was these\u00a0words.Weren\u2019t\u00a0these traps often set when hunting?\u201cF*ck! Why did a hole suddenly appear on\u00a0the battlefield?\u201d\u201cYou are stupid, the field is specially checked, how could there be such a mistake? It must have been dug by Jiang Fan\u2019s side in advance.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also not right. Only when the competition begins both sides can enter the arena. How can they dig ahead? Such a huge pit, even a warrior or martial artist with plenty of energy would have to dig it for a long time.\u201d\u201cDo you guys think of the extremely corrosive blood that Jiang Fan used to deal with Tang Qingqing? If they used this type of blood, they might be able to dig a large hole in a short period of time!\u201dInside the viewing room,\u00a0a heated discussion rang out.This trap tactic\u00a0was a total surprise, even for a bunch of teachers.Even if it was the Lord of Jiangcheng City.He also slightly nodded, praised: \u201cThis little guy is not bad, surprisingly, in a desperate situation, they can still be wise in a hurry, and think of this\u2026\u2026 idea!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, he underestimated the ability of the Xiu Ling people, and the retreat of the soldiers in front of him just now, coupled with the slight shaking of the ground, have caused the Xiu Ling people to be alerted.\u201d\u201cIt almost worked.\u201dOne by one, the teachers were shaking their heads and sighing.But they misunderstood,\u00a0this idea was not thought of by Jiang Fan.Rather, it was from the Transcendental Research team.Many people were discussing this.For many people it was good!Upon seeing the two huge spirit tree men, one scholar had suggested such a means of targeting\u00a0and it was adopted by Qi on the spot.He\u00a0implemented it right away!Everything the Great Desert Army did after that,\u00a0included using the three thousand\u00a0soldiers of the heavy cavalry to charge at the Xiu Ling people with all their might.Everything\u00a0that was done before was to dig this hole as a cover!Naturally, it was easy to do in a short time by\u00a0using the remaining blood of the crimson lion.They dug\u00a0a big hole out of it.The solubility of the\u00a0crimson lion\u2019s\u00a0blood was too high.However, even the bones of Transcendent individuals could not block it, not to mention the clay and ordinary stones.It drained all the Crimson lion\u2019s blood!And the results\u00a0were still nothing!The slight shaking of the ground and the subtle sound produced underneath when the lancers retreated.It was still a very sensitive Xiu Ling person who perceived it!A lot of people in the Transcendental Research team looked regretful!If this would have worked, the two-spirit\u00a0tree people would fall down!\u201cHuh?\u201dIn the battle room. Bu Jing Yue, who always had a calm face, a hint of fluctuation appeared on that beautiful face for the first time!Even if the two-spirit\u00a0trees fell into the deep pit.It was not that big of a deal!\u201cKeep shooting arrows and stop them!\u201d Qi did not change his face from the beginning to the end.He was still in command with a strong voice!After seeing these two deep holes, there was also a hint of anger on\u00a0the faces of many Xiu Ling people on the spirit tree.How dare they backstab us?\u201cGo around from both sides and crush them!\u201d The elder Xiu Ling clansman shouted loudly.The two-spirit\u00a0tree people slowly moved their bodies.Since there was a deep pit in the middle, only one tree man could go from one\u00a0side.They were going through from the left and right side\u00a0to close in on the Great Desolation Army\u2019s position, then\u2026\u2026 deliver the final blow!The Great Desolate Army didn\u2019t sit back and wait!The rain of arrows, giant crossbows, and kerosene spells continued to pound through with desperation!The heavy cavalry in the rear also re-formed.Once again, they were rushing for their lives!Each one was like a madman in desperation\u00a0and was\u00a0fighting to the death.It filled the formation of the Great Desolate Army.It was a wave of determination to face death for the sake of Glory!\u201cHumph, no matter how many ants there are, they\u2019re just ants!\u201dA Xiu Ling clan member contemptuously swept his eyes at the Great Desolate Army, and a hint of condescension flashed in his eyes!As an immortal cultivator was supposed to be high up!They looked down on the advanced civilizations, not to mention\u00a0these ordinary people!\u201cJiang Fan\u2026\u2026 can admit defeat, right?\u201dFeeling that dense atmosphere of despair, even Tong Zhen Sheng could not help but speak.During the match, the battle room was completely closed.No one could contact the players inside!Yet no one noticed\u00a0the two-spirit\u00a0tree people walking\u00a0past the two sides of the large pit.Qi, who always had a calm face, a\u00a0faint and mysterious smile appeared on his face!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Astonishing Might! The whole audience is shocked! Grand Competition\u2026\u2026 First!!!Because the Great Desolate Army had created a huge pit in the middle of the battlefield.So, two-spirit\u00a0tree people had to split into two teams.As they were passing by the sides of the big pit, the Great Desolate Army was shooting arrows crazily.The rock throwers were frantically throwing boulders and kerosene.The heavy cavalry in the rear was also lunging frantically.At the same time, the lancers in the front\u00a0left a huge shield.Once again, they formed a temporary giant shield formation!All of the soldiers of the Great Desolate Army were\u00a0struggling.They were fighting to the death!Just admit defeat?That\u2019s not going to happen.The audience outside the arena supporting Jiang Fan was\u00a0clenching their fists!Reluctantly, they were looking at the scales of victory.It was tipping over to Bu Jing Yue little by little.It was just like in the previous life, fans were watching the final match of the national football!Behind the Great Desolate Army, Qi and the Transcendental Research team\u2019s faces\u00a0were\u00a0still unchanged.Even\u2026\u2026Someone\u2019s eyes were filled with anticipation and excitement!Qi and the Transcendental Research team were fully prepared three days before this match.They were studying the videos of the matches of the\u00a0Xiu Ling clan.At that time, they did not know that it was called the Xiu Ling clan\u00a0but it was also clear that this race was scary!The sudden appearance of two-spirit\u00a0tree people disrupted all the deployments!It was like the battle with Tang Qingqing.It was necessary to break through the spirit tree\u2019s line of defense.To make it possible to kill the Xiu Ling race!While\u2026\u2026Unlike the Dou Qi warriors, these spirit tree people not only had more amazing defensive power and recovery.In addition, the combat power was also very strong.Those big, wide hands\u00a0were directly able to shoot a heavy cavalry into the sky!This was not a match for human power.Therefore\u2026\u2026After witnessing the superlative spirit tree people, Qi immediately realized it in his mind.All Great Desolate Army\u2019s current weapons,\u00a0including three thousand soldiers\u00a0of the heavy cavalry, giant crossbows and the blood of crimson lions were much of a threat to the Spirit Tree People!Qi was the emperor of the Xia Kingdom\u00a0but let\u2019s not forget\u00a0that he himself was the era\u2026\u2026He was the most talented genius!Behind him,\u00a0there was a bunch of people from the transcendental research team.But there were many different opinions.A lot of offers would appear\u00a0but\u00a0it was Qi who made the final decision.So far, Qi made every decision without failure!Even\u2026\u2026Many of the methods that made people\u2019s eyes light up were the ones he had thought of!After realizing that conventional weapons were of no use, Qi was the first to make a decision.He sighed inwardly\u00a0and\u00a0commanded the guard team\u00a0for gun powder.It was mobilized since the production.It had been sealed.No one could move it, except for Qi.Qi considered this weapon the beginning of the devil!In fact, in the previous life,\u00a0all\u00a0black powder\u00a0was\u00a0for military use.It ended the era of cold weapons, leaving the pride of the cavalry beyond redemption!After this, the era of thermal weapons was\u00a0activated!It was a highly lethal weapon.They\u00a0started to be born one after another.It was also bringing huge casualties to humans!To reduce the possibility of being discovered\u00a0no one could move\u00a0it except for Qi and the Transcendent Research team.It was not leaked to any of the soldiers of the Great Desolate Army.All the soldiers\u00a0of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0only knew to follow Qi\u2019s orders.They were desperately sniping at the two approaching spirit tree men!Arrow rain, giant crossbow, kerosene, heavy cavalry, etc.All of this, including the deep pit,\u00a0dug with the blood of crimson lions,\u00a0was all just to cover for the true killing move of gun\u00a0powder!Even if the Spirit Tree people did not fall into the pit.It didn\u2019t affect the final plan in any way!In order to deal with the thick and sturdy Spirit Tree people, Qi\u2019s heart was ruthless.He directly used all the gun\u00a0powder!\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026 thousands of pounds, right?\u201dInside the battle room, Qi made this move privately.Naturally, all under the nose of Jiang Fan!Seeing the huge amount of black powder, Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but be a little staggered!This was to\u00a0mean!This equivalent amount was impossible to compare with modern gunpowder from the previous life.But under high equivalence, its power\u00a0would be\u00a0really quite scary!This gun\u00a0powder was already placed\u00a0by Qi\u2019s personal guard when they were digging the hole.It was personally placed on both sides of the hole\u2026\u2026 rock wall!Each side had thousands of kilograms of black gunpowder.At this time, two-spirit\u00a0tree people, with huge body sizes, were walking slowly above these gun\u00a0powder!To disguise the smell of gun\u00a0powder.Qi ordered the archery team to come a little earlier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Grand Competition\u2026\u2026 First!!!They started firing a lot of arrows with the blood of crimson lions!The strong smell of the blood of the crimson lion\u00a0covered up all the surrounding smell.Even the Xiu Ling people who had a keen sense of smell were not able\u00a0to smell what was buried underneath.It was like gun\u00a0powder with no obvious smell!\u201cWarriors of the Great Desolate army, where is your courage?\u201dSeeing that the time was right, Qi directly raised his long sword high in the air\u00a0and shouted angrily.\u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201dThis was the response of the Great Desolate Army.The sound vibrated high in the sky\u00a0like a thunderclap!It resounded throughout the battlefield!This shout from Qi was not to inspire the fighting spirit of the Great Desolate Army.Instead, \u2026\u2026It was to cover up the sound of the fuses underneath!The sound was not loud though\u00a0but just in case\u00a0he was still doing all the adequate work!\u201cLittle ants, ridiculous!\u201dLooking at the shouts of the Great Desolate Army and their blood boiling!A Xiu Ling clan member couldn\u2019t help but let out a taunt!It was like seeing\u00a0a\u00a0bunch of ants\u00a0doing pre-war mobilization.It was like preparing\u00a0to challenge yourself as a lion!\u201cSpeed up!\u201dThe aged Xiu Ling clan member also shouted.The various actions of the Great Desolate Army made this patriarch of the Xiu Ling clan feel offended as well.If continued to drag on.It was totally humiliating.The two-spirit\u00a0tree people were still young.Rather, they were very obedient.They tried their best to speed up.They started taking a big step forward!At the same time, it was also the official step on the burial place of the gun\u00a0powder!Brush, brush, brush\u2026\u2026The lance soldiers collectively gripped their lances tightly.They did not know the inside story.They were prepared\u00a0to fight to the death against the two behemoths approaching!Even at the cost of living, the heavy cavalry behind had also caught up.Frantically, they lunged toward\u00a0the spirit tree people.Some soldiers also jumped directly onto the branches and leaves.They were even prepared to use their mouths\u00a0to bite off the flesh of the opponent.Seeing this magnificent scene of the Great Desolate Army, many viewers couldn\u2019t help being moved!\u201cI\u2019ve decided, even if Jiang Fan loses this one, I\u2019ll be a fan of Jiang Fan from now on!\u201d\u201cWhat a ruthless determination. Even when facing such a strong opponent and making people despair, they definitely won\u2019t give up!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that Jiang Fan has come this far, and he really has a hand in cultivating ordinary people!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOne by one, they were discussing with emotion.As compared to the general audience, the faces of a group of teachers were calm.Among them, the least of them had also participated in more than ten big competitions.They had seen all kinds of scenes.Of course, it was impossible to be moved by this kind of determination.\u201cAn unwise move, an unwise move.\u201dInstead, some teachers were shaking their heads.It was just a match, it was\u00a0not like there was\u00a0a real war.What are you working so hard for?Many talented students in the front\u00a0had a vision that once you see that the situation is\u00a0not favorable, immediately choose to admit defeat!\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dAn older teacher said faintly.\u201cYes, it\u2019s over.\u201dIn the battle room, the corners of Jiang Fan\u2019s mouth curled up slightly!If such a large amount of gun powder exploded.In his previous life, he had only seen it on the screen\u00a0but\u00a0now, he could see it with his own eyes.As the two-spirit\u00a0tree people stepped on the gun\u00a0powder ambush site.The two fuses burned\u00a0and finally,\u00a0it came to an end.The calculations from Qi himself were very accurate!It was not a hair out of place.The tiny sound of burning could be heard.In the surrounding sky, the shattering roars of anger could also be heard.It was completely negligible.And at this moment\u00a0no Xiu Ling people would raise their vigilance.Inside the viewing room,\u00a0experienced and insightful leading teachers all just thought\u00a0that the big hole just now was Jiang Fan\u2019s last trick!They couldn\u2019t possibly imagine\u00a0that the big hole\u00a0was\u00a0just a disguise for the real plan!The fuse burned to the end.In the next moment!There was a loud bang!It was a loud sound that could no longer be described in words!It was like a dragon turning over!The whole ground exploded!Countless clay, stones, and vegetation on the ground flew out!The ground in the field of vision shook like a mountain.Even the air was trembling violently!That amazing and terrifying power was only through the projection\u00a0but it\u00a0made people tremble!Not to mention the crowd on the battlefield.At the command of Qi, the rest of the Great Desolate Army had long since crouched down.They were hiding behind the giant shield formation.These giant shields\u00a0were\u00a0made with the last bit of vibranium.Under the power of two huge explosions, it was instantly black!Immediately afterward\u2026\u2026 they were broken by inches.The lancers were close behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you can defeat Bu Jing Yue, that\u2019s your strength.\u201dJiangcheng City Lord smiled.Immediately looking at Jiang Fan, his tone calmed down and asked, \u201cAre you willing to\u00a0enter my sect? Of course, it is not a formal apprenticeship, but a registered disciple!\u201dThe teachers next to him were not surprised.In the previous big competition reward, just one of them was\u00a0personally taught by the Lord of Jiangcheng City.The meaning was obvious, this year\u2019s session was the most monstrous one in history.Even the Jiangcheng City Lord was a bit moved.So, there was such an extra reward.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dJiang Fan blinked and said with some embarrassment, \u201cCan we change the reward?\u201dHearing this, Tong Zhensheng and Qiu Yunfei almost wanted to reach out\u00a0and\u00a0slap Jiang\u00a0Fan\u2019s face.Jiangcheng City Lord rarely accepted disciples, not to mention honorary disciples.Even if he wanted to get his guidance, that was also very difficult to do, not to mention\u00a0the registered disciple.As long as nothing unexpected happened, it was only a matter of time before he became a full disciple, a\u00a0disciple of a fifth-level planet master.Who wouldn\u2019t be impressed?But he actually refused it!\u201cHa ha ha.\u201dJiangcheng City Lord was slightly stunned but did not take it personally and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been disliked, but you\u2019re building a civilization of ordinary people, in this regard, I really don\u2019t have much experience and can\u2019t teach you much. In that case, let\u2019s change the reward.\u201dSeeing that the Jiangcheng City Lord was not angry, Tong Zhen Sheng and others were slightly relieved.\u201cThank you, City Lord!\u201dJiang Fan naturally would not accept any \u201cnamed disciple\u201d.There was a deduction system.Besides, the evolution of Blue Star was primed to be on track.According to the previous regulations,\u00a0this time, the rewards of the grand competition were exceptionally generous.There were three in total \u2013One hundred million federal dollars in cash!Eligibility to pick any one treasure from the City Lord\u2019s treasure trove.As well as\u00a0the personal teaching of the Lord of Jiangcheng City!Of these three, the most valued by Tong Zhensheng and other geniuses was the last one.But for Jiang Fan, the first two were the key, especially the 100 million federal dollars.That represents a hundred parts of the original\u00a0power!It was enough to keep Jiang Fan from having to deal with the headache of origin power for a long time in the future.It could also make Blue Star evolve for a long time!Soon, at the insistence of Tong Zhensheng, Jiang Fan was sent to the City Lord\u2019s Mansion by a rune car from No. 7 Middle School.This was a large building that resembled the Gothic style of the previous life!One couldn\u2019t even see the end!In the \u00a0City Lord\u2019s Mansion, someone had already come up to greet them!It was an old man dressed in black.Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but glance at the aura on his body.Surprisingly, it was not even close to Tong Zhen Sheng.It was at least a level 4 planet master!At the prompt of Tong Zhensheng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 : Unexpected prizes! Atomic Dinosaurs! Godzilla\u2019s roots!Jiang Fan just realized\u00a0that this old man in black was actually the butler of the City Lord\u2019s Mansion.It also showed the Jiangcheng City Lord\u2019s attention to Jiang Fan!\u201cPlease come with me.\u201dThe old butler did not take Jiang Fan lightly because he was\u00a0young.He invited Jiang Fan inside, very politely.He took Jiang Fan to the legendary treasure house of the city lord.\u201cRumor has it that as the strongest person in Jiangcheng, the Jiangcheng City Lord is very powerful.\u201dJiang Fan remembered what Tong Zhensheng said on the road.\u201cOften able to plunder various treasures from some masterless planets.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe collection in the treasure house of the city lord is very rich!\u201d\u201cBut this is also the most important place in the entire City Lord\u2019s Mansion, and it is very heavily guarded!\u201d\u201cEven Principal Tong is not qualified to come in once!\u201dWhile thinking about it, he followed the old butler\u00a0and stepped into the door of the treasure trove.The scene inside\u00a0lit up Jiang\u00a0Fan\u2019s eyes!This was a huge hall!He couldn\u2019t even see the end of it at a glance!In the middle of the hall, there was a set-up with a clear crystal!It was sealed.It was a treasure that was extremely rare to see in the outside world!\u201cThese are the collections of the city lord.\u201dThe old butler introduced.\u201cCan I pick any of them?\u201dJiang Fan asked.\u201cOf course, you can pick any one of the treasures here, but within an hour.\u201dThe old butler said.Beneath that ancient, unruffled face, it seemed to carry a hint of an inexplicable smile.Sure enough, Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but complain in his heart\u00a0because it wasn\u2019t that good.In the treasure house of the city lord everything was not very valuable either.Some\u00a0things were\u00a0just relatively rare.Or it could be said that the City Lord of Jiangcheng had his eye on it.Once picked badly, it might not even sell for a few dollars.That\u2019s right\u2026\u2026For Jiang Fan, the most important purpose of selecting treasure was to sell it\u00a0for money\u00a0because the treasure was of little use to him.As he had only one hour, Jiang Fan quickened his pace.He\u00a0quickly looked at them one by one.To be honest, Jiang Fan did not recognize any of these treasuresThere was no way because he came from the bottom of the social ladder.It\u00a0was good to be able to read\u00a0but it was naturally impossible to have any insight.However, Jiang Fan still had a system.Immediately, Jiang Fan was prepared to call out the system.\u201cSystem, help me deduce that in this treasure house of the city lord, the most valuable\u2026\u2026 not right.\u201dThinking about it.Jiang Fan changed his mind and said, \u201cWhat is the most beneficial treasure for the development of the Blue Star?\u201dAfter a few moments, the result of the deduction came out\u2013Deduction result: No. 81.\u201cNo. 81?\u201dJiang Fan raised his eyebrows\u00a0and quickly walked to the treasure of No. 81.It was a giant creature sealed by a crystal!Inside the treasury of the city lord, it was not just about having all kinds of valuable items.There were also precious transcendent creatures captured from various planets by the lord of Jiangcheng City!What made Jiang Fan feel a little strange was that, outside this crystal\u00a0there was only a simple number identification.There was not any description of this creature.The old butler\u2019s face\u00a0became weird as he saw\u00a0that Jiang Fan actually stopped in front of this creature.Of course he knew why the creature didn\u2019t have a name?Because\u00a0this was just the legendary 'strange creature\u201d!What was a strange creature?Those unknown creatures had\u00a0great strength, but without a trace of transcendental energy in their bodies!So far, no one could figure out the origin and formation of these organisms.They were collectively referred to as strange creatures!Due to the rarity, it was a favorite collection of all powerful planet masters!On the market, the trade value was also quite high.That\u00a0was the reason why the old butler looked weird.It was a strange creature from the outside.It was also huge.It was indistinguishable from transcendent creatures!Even if it was the Lord of Jiangcheng City, he could not determine directly that it was a strange creature.And Jiang Fan\u2026\u2026A high school student who had just awakened the planet for a month.How could he recognize it?The old butler was somewhat unconvinced.Coughing slightly, he came up and said, \u201cDo you want to pick this one?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJiang Fan nodded.Listening to the system was certainly right.\u201cDo you know what kind of creature this is?\u201dThe old butler looked at Jiang Fan and asked.\u201cNo idea.\u201dJiang Fan said truthfully.Although the system thought that the most preferred one was this huge unknown creature in front of him.However, no specific information was given.Jiang Fan really did not know.\u201cNo idea?\u201dThe old butler was slightly stunned, and then asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t know, and still choose this one?\u201d\u201cJust a feeling.\u201dJiang Fan smiled faintly.The old butler was a little speechless\u00a0but he could only follow the promise of the city lord of Jiangcheng.Jiang Fan could take anything he wanted to take!The old butler moved his right hand lightly.The sealing crystal of this huge creature was rapidly shrinking.The old butler handed it to Jiang Fan and said, \u201cThe shrinking of the sealing crystal requires a large amount of origin power, and the higher the multiple of shrinking, the more origin power is consumed, so\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter you take it back, try to find a place and restore it!\u201dJiang Fan said thanks\u00a0and took away the crystal.Under Tong Zhensheng\u2019s insistence to personally pick him up, Jiang Fan went back to his relief house.The house was too small.Jiang Fan could only enlarge the sealed crystal to a size that the room could just fit!\u201cGotta get rid of this thing fast.\u201dJiang Fan thought darkly for a moment\u00a0and then he asked the system, \u201cSystem, help me deduce the origin of this creature?\u201dThe results of the deduction came out quickly\u2013Atomic dinosaurs, strange creatures born by accident on an unowned planet.\u201cAtomic dinosaurs?\u201dSeeing this term, Jiang Fan\u2019s expression turned a little weird.Was this creature the atomic dinosaur from those movies and TV series from the previous life?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 : Blue Star\u2019s Evolution! The birth of a little atomic dinosaur! The death of Qi!This kind of thing had only appeared in film and television productions, so Jiang Fan could not be sure.Fortunately, there was a deduction system.Jiang Fan directly asked, \u201cSystem, help me deduce the biological characteristics, species category, body composition, and genetic sequence of this creature\u2026\u2026\u201dJiang Fan said a whole lot in one breath.The system, on the other hand, continued to respond.After a few moments, the results were out!Looking at this huge pile of dense text, Jiang Fan couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.He could only browse through it carefully.After reading it, Jiang Fan became more convinced of his previous guesses.\u201cThis creature is not quite the same as the atomic dinosaur in my memory, but\u2026\u2026\u201dJiang Fan muttered, \u201cMany characteristics still have similarities.\u201d\u201cThat means.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this creature a more primitive atomic dinosaur?\u201dIn terms of strength, the creature wasn\u2019t strong either.There was nothing special about the ability.It\u00a0was just that the body was bigger!It could be said that\u00a0it was no different from ordinary dinosaurs.\u201cSystem, deduce the most suitable time and place to cultivate this atomic dinosaur on the Blue Star?\u201dJiang Fan continued to ask.Previously in the City Lord\u2019s Treasure house, what Jiang Fan claimed\u00a0was\u00a0the most beneficial treasure for the development of Blue Star.The answer given by the system was this \u201catomic dinosaur\u201d.Apparently, it should be possible for this atomic dinosaur to survive on the Blue Star.Soon, the system gave the answer again.This time, Jiang Fan just took a look at this result\u00a0and did not continue to dig deeper\u00a0because he had\u00a0something more important to do now.\u2026\u2026When he was getting back to the Qi of the Xia Kingdom, he\u00a0ran\u00a0out of gas!In the capital city of Xia Kingdom, the palace was heavily surrounded by the Great Desolate Army!No one was allowed to fly in.The soldiers of the Great Desolate Army\u00a0had\u00a0no joy in just winning.Instead, it was replaced by a heavy sadness.Shortly after returning from the triumph, there was not much time left for Qi.After these continuous battles, he was exhausted!He came back to the palace\u00a0and after a short celebration ceremony,\u00a0he collapsed.Han and all the princes, concubines, and ministers all knelt outside the palace.Everyone was silent\u00a0because everyone\u00a0could see that\u00a0Qi was already running out of life.He had reached the end of life.In these last moments of life, Qi asked the Guards to drive everyone\u00a0out of the room.The only thing that left many people wondering\u00a0was that the air shook for a moment.Jiang Fan appeared.\u201cFather!\u201dEvery time he saw Jiang Fan, Qi was extraordinarily excited.This time out of excitement, there was more than a hint of relief.The task given to him by Jiang Fan\u00a0was completed successfully!Qi silently watched the air.There was hope in his eyes.In his head, he recalled the first time he was called over by his father, the moment he saw the Father\u00a0and all that he followed, Jiang Fan was not just his guide\u00a0or the closest people.\u201cYou have done a good job, and your achievements are not inferior to that of your father.\u201dThere was no text displayed from Jiang Fan this time, instead, he used the air.He was vibrating out the sound.Hearing these words from\u00a0Jiang Fan, a\u00a0small smile appeared on Qi\u2019s face.He closed his eyes without any regrets\u00a0and passed away!Qi\u2019s\u00a0biggest wish was nothing but Jiang Fan\u2019s affirmation.The death of Qi\u00a0opened a new chapter of\u00a0the Xia Kingdom.Later generations had a very high opinion of Qi.It was the budding era of technological development.It laid a solid foundation for the establishment of many subsequent disciplines!According to Qi\u2019s last words, Qi\u2019s body was buried in that one mountain range outside the planet passage.Starting with Qi, this became the final home of a succession of emperors.Later generations called it \u201cRoyal Tomb Mountain\u201d.It was also in line with the saying \u2013The emperor guards the gate of the country, and the king dies in the society!The 30,000 soldiers of the Great Desolate Army were\u00a0not abolished.They directly moved to Royal Tomb Mountain.As the defending troops, they continued to exist.The burial of Qi was short.The captain of Qi\u2019s personal guards was also his childhood companion and most trusted person.With a box, he walked into the barracks of the Great Desolate Army.He took out a small black token from the box.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201dThe captain of the guard pointed in the direction of his head and said respectfully, \u201cA reward for you.\u201d\u201cEveryone take a drop of blood.\u201d\u201cIn the future, if you or your descendants have any difficulties.\u201d\u201cJust trigger this token.\u201d\u201cBy this, a\u00a0crisis can be spared!\u201d\u201cThere is only one chance.\u201d\u201cPlease use with caution.\u201dAs the captain\u2019s voice fell, the eyes of all the soldiers showed a trace of shock.Having participated in the Grand competition, soldiers of the Great Desolate Army had been convinced\u00a0that behind Qi, there was\u00a0a god standing.After the big competition, Qi naturally did not forget the generous reward of the Great Desolate Army.He left a\u00a0token for\u00a0each of these soldiers.On the token, there was a mark printed with the power of the origin!As soon as it was triggered, they\u00a0could\u00a0touch the power of the origin in it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 : Blue Star\u2019s Evolution! The birth of a little atomic dinosaur! The death of Qi!This very small amount of power of origin\u00a0could mobilize the surrounding time and space, moving this person directly to another uninhabited place.In other words, the effect of this token was not that powerful, it could only allow one person to temporarily survive.But because no one would try it,\u00a0all of them were treated as\u00a0divine objects.It was treasured at the highest standard.These soldiers were also aware that\u00a0this token\u00a0was a life-saving item.More than that, it could be passed on\u00a0and could only be used once.As a last resort, no one wanted to use it!Shortly after the death of Qi, Han officially succeeded to the throne!In the succession to the throne this time, there were no twists or turns.The brothers and sisters of Han were mediocre people with little ambition\u00a0and Han followed Qi and participated in the competition.A part of the reputation was already established.Naturally, there was no controversy.As compared with Qi,\u00a0Han had some talent in medicine\u00a0but there was only some talent\u00a0not quite top-notch.By this time, the development of the Xia Kingdom in various fields was all on the right track!Jiang Fan also gradually reduced the frequency of direct intervention.At the same time,\u00a0a hundred portions of the power of origin weren\u2019t\u00a0bought for 100 million federal dollars.It was Jiang Fan who rejected the City Lord\u2019s acceptance.Rather, it was after Jiang Fan refused the acceptance of the Jiangcheng City Lord as his apprentice.As a replacement reward from the city lord of Jiangcheng, Jiang Fan also didn\u2019t need to worry about the power of origin anymore.He directly accelerated the time flow of Blue Star.Jiang Fan once again disguised, as a bystander\u00a0he was quietly watching the evolution of this planet.It was not only the development of Xia\u2019s technology, there was also\u00a0the whole evolution of the Blue Star!Following the system\u2019s deduction, the best place to put atomic dinosaurs\u00a0was\u00a0another continent of the Blue Star.There were only two continents in the Blue Star.One piece\u00a0was the continent where the Xia Kingdom was located.Almost all lives\u00a0existed there.The other piece was much smaller, this piece of land was created shortly after the birth of life on the Blue Star.But at that time, it was a small island that couldn\u2019t be any smaller.With the evolution of the Blue Star, it was gradually getting bigger.This speed was accelerating even more\u00a0but as compared with the land where the Xia Kingdom was located, it was just a little bitty.There was a turbulent sea between this land and the Xia Kingdom.No one could cross the great waves to get here.It gave the opportunity for the complete development of life on land.Due to the different environments, the life born on this piece of land was also not\u00a0the\u00a0same as on the main continent.\u201cLet\u2019s call it the first continent and the second continent, and then name it later.\u201dJiang Fan named this scrap.For the time being, the two continents were given such names.In this era, no one had noticed\u00a0the formation of the second continent\u00a0yet.Within the Xia Kingdom, people were focused on recuperation.Han also did not forget Qi\u2019s explanation.He also took\u00a0scrupulous things as the foundation of the continent!Various disciplines had been further developed.Some interesting inventions were popping up like bamboo shoots after rain!Within 10 years under Han\u2019s rule.The elements of the periodic table were\u00a0proposed for the first time, and the concept of elements was fully formed!Within 12 years of\u00a0Han\u2019s rule, some scholars had discovered the laws of heredity.This discovery laid the foundation for genetics and the subsequent concept of genes.But it was just a discovery.The lack\u00a0of adequate equipment\u00a0made subsequent research progress slow.Within 15 years of\u00a0Han\u2019s rule, there was a famous experiment done by a young scholar.The scholar climbed to the top of a leaning tower in the capital\u00a0and\u00a0threw an iron ball weighing 100 pounds and a one-pound ball at the same time.Everyone\u00a0thought that\u00a0the two iron balls would\u00a0fall\u00a0to the ground almost parallel to each other\u00a0but\u00a0with the results of this experiment, everyone present was dumbfounded and at a loss of words.This beautiful story, which was hailed as the \u201cLeaning Tower Test\u201d by the scientific community in the future, had proved by the fact\u00a0that objects with different weights falling\u00a0from the same height, would not land at the same time!This overturned the misconceptions of many previous scholars.The foundation was laid for the law of free fall which\u00a0was recognized later.Within 20 years under Han\u2019s rule, it was a year of great explosion in various disciplines.This\u00a0year, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Han\u2019s accession to the throne, each discipline was officially established.Medicine, physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and a dozen other disciplines were established.Under Han\u2019s personal will, the final naming was completed.Behind these disciplines,\u00a0there was another discipline that was not publicly available and for which Han was personally responsible was not a pharmaceutical category.Rather, it was the discipline of Transcendental Studies!Han did not forget that beyond the Blue Star, there were other worlds too.The Transcendental Institute was still operating normally.It\u00a0was just that, it\u00a0had\u00a0been twenty years\u00a0and not once did Father\u2019s instructions appear!As the saying goes, the top was the bottom.Because Han himself was an expert in medicine.So\u00a0medicine\u00a0had been sufficiently developed\u00a0during the reign of Han.The school of Medicine became the most popular school.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 : Blue Star\u2019s Evolution! The birth of a little atomic dinosaur! The death of Qi!Various departments also gave the red light to research in medicine to a greater or lesser extent!This led to the development of other disciplines as well.Within 50 years under Han\u2019s rule, the technology explosion since the beginning of Qi was caught in a bottleneck.Part of the reason for this came from the resource constraints of the Blue Star itself.This time, the population of the Xia Kingdom had exceeded one million people.The area of Blue Star had grown a lot.Iron ore began to be discovered.But there were still very few reserves.As for the other metals, the categories came together.There were some that had not even appeared in Jiang Fan\u2019s previous life on Earth.But most of the reserves were not enough.A lot of equipment could not be manufactured.The main reason for that was the atmosphere of the entire Xia Kingdom that was slowly changing.The frail Han had been in place for so many years\u00a0and he\u00a0was also getting old.The latter was more concerned with the maintenance of the body.There was little energy to care about the development of various disciplines.The research\u00a0was started that was focused on extending life.There was a sudden explosion in\u00a0its growth during this time!All the officials shouted the slogan of extending life for Han and supported the research of life science.However, some officials had used this slogan to start all kinds of corruption and enrichment in private.When Jiang Fan saw that the development of the discipline was once again out of balance, he\u00a0still did not intervene.For Jiang Fan, this kind of story had long been accustomed to seeing in the history books of his\u00a0previous life.This was the inevitable trend of historical development\u00a0and there was no need to spoil\u00a0it.As the saying goes, the old doesn\u2019t go away and the new doesn\u2019t come!Jiang Fan\u2019s gaze at this time was more on top of the second continent.There, more and more lives\u00a0were\u00a0emerging.There were weak rats.There were also giant creepy crawly creatures!\u201cThe time has come.\u201dJiang Fan took the sealed crystal into his hand.He was waiting for the time period which the system deduced.He threw this sealed crystal in, by using a trace of the power of the origin.It was thrown on the second continent.According to common sense, no object could enter the planet from the outside world\u00a0unless the crystal was used to seal the item!To seal an item, it required a powerful planet master to control.So, the sealed\u00a0crystals were very expensive.In addition, in the early stages of planet development, any external objects could destroy the ecological balance of the planet.The only exception was Jiang Fan, who had a deduction system.This atomic dinosaur was thrown to the second continent.It woke up soon\u00a0and looked\u00a0at this strange illusion.After yelling a few times, he actually looked directly for a hidden place\u00a0and\u00a0went to sleep!As the largest creature in size here, this atomic dinosaur was not ambitious at all and did not go out hunting much.He was just lying lazily in the same place in the sun every day!It got some water only when it was thirsty.When it was hungry it went to the nearby lake and caught\u00a0some fish for his\u00a0belly!Jiang Fan was speechless when he saw that lying flat posture.Jiang Fan directly named this atomic dinosaur \u2014 Lan!Over time, there was a growing variety of life there.There were many species, all were not present in his\u00a0previous life on Earth.Jiang Fan roughly judged what kind it was\u00a0only by appearance.Jiang Fan felt that\u00a0the evolution of the Blue Star was moving in a different direction than it did on Earth in his previous life!Lan was still very lazy\u00a0but it still couldn\u2019t resist the nature of animals.After a passage of time spring arrived\u00a0and all things were revived.It was animal mating season again!Lan while basking in the sun, a silly look flashed in his eyes. when he was\u00a0staring at one of the animals at the lakeFinally, after some fierce struggle, Lan was laying on the back of a large reptile that looked like a lizard.Soon after that, this large unknown lizard laid its eggs.Lan was not a good father\u00a0so he was still basking in the sun.It simply didn\u2019t bother him\u00a0and the large lizards hatched alone.After one year, a\u00a0few cute little beings broke their eggshells\u00a0and crawled out.The newborn little\u00a0life was simply impossible to tell who was who.But time passed quickly\u00a0and three years later, these little creatures grew tall.Their appearance was also more clear.They were like a mix of Lan and a big lizard.The body structure and biological characteristics were also a combination of both.After ten years, these little guys were finally growing into adults.These descendants were not peaceful like Lan.They were doing all kinds of tossing and turning on land.They were seeking hegemony.They each found a mate that was pleasing to the eye just like Lan.After one year,\u00a0Lan\u2019s grandchildren were born!The difference between this generation and Lan was even more obvious.Although the number was much higher,\u00a0none of them inherited certain characteristics of Lan.Thereafter, Lan\u2019s genes went along with these offspring.It was passed on from generation to generation\u00a0and Lan was getting older.As an atomic dinosaur, the life cycle was very long\u00a0but this was the first generation.It was still no different from ordinary creatures.But after Lan\u2019s fifth-generation\u00a0descendants appeared, Lan\u2019s life also came to an end.Among the descendants of the fifth generation, a second atomic dinosaur appeared!This atomic dinosaur not only inherited all the characteristics of Lan but also had been optimized!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 : Initial shape of the atomic dinosaur! The Ancestor of King Kong! Dong wins!As the second atomic dinosaur, this little guy had been restless since he was born!He was the exact opposite of the first generation of Lan.He was naughty and mischievous all day long.At a very young age, it showed a talent that surpassed that of its peers.It had more strength, thicker scale armor, higher intelligence, and more flexible movements.In short, it was exactly like two species, except for the similarity in appearance.It was also even better\u00a0than the first generation of Lan.It could really justify the words \u201catomic dinosaur\u201d.Jiang Fan paid close attention to the second atomic dinosaur\u00a0because atomic dinosaurs were not easy to create.Lan\u2019s genes had been passed down for generations.Among the hundreds of descendants, he was the only offspring who inherited the Lan gene.The genes of this generation of atomic dinosaurs\u00a0were significantly more optimized.Not only all physical qualities were greatly enhanced,\u00a0but in addition, it began to have the consciousness and aura of an overlord.Jiang Fan named this second atomic dinosaur \u2014 Dong!Dong\u2019s genes were better\u00a0but the growth was extremely slow.The siblings grew to adulthood in three years,\u00a0while Dong, on the other hand, was still a teenager.After five years, Dong was still an adult.The\u00a0power of the adult Dong was immense\u00a0and it had a territorial awareness.The lake where Lan basked in the sun before his death was the largest lake on\u00a0the Second Continent.It was completely occupied by Dong without any courtesy.It seemed to enjoy these days when it was facing\u00a0the big lake and the flowers bloomed in spring.No other animals were allowed to approach there.Anything that was disobedient\u00a0was\u00a0dealt with by Dong, dry and crisp.The animals in the vicinity trembled.Even the tall brown bears and saber-toothed tigers were not a match for Dong!Jiang Fan looked the size of Dong, his\u00a0head was small, and his\u00a0tail was relatively long.On the back, there were obvious thorns\u00a0and his\u00a0eyes were quite sharp.\u201cWhy does it look like Godzilla, the king of monsters who likes to maintain the peace of the Earth, but there seems to be some difference?\u201dJiang Fan observed Dong\u2019s every move\u00a0but it was not possible to be completely sure.He could only ask the system to help again.As a result, there was nothing unexpected, Dong was not that little brat!Besides physical fitness, everything was just a little bit off.The most important thing was\u00a0that there was no iconic atomic reactor inside Dong!He was still unable to escape the range of ordinary giant beasts, but Jiang Fan was not anxious at all.In his previous life, it didn\u2019t happen overnight either in the movie.Instead, it evolved from the dinosaur era, a little bit.Jiang Fan had the power of origin, he just needed to evolve it slowly.Jiang Fan was still very clear about the fact that he couldn\u2019t eat hot tofu in a hurry.Dong was very dominant\u00a0but there was no escaping the nature of animals.By that\u00a0time, it was fifteen years old\u00a0and was looking at the gaze of a reptile of the opposite sex.Something was not right\u00a0but finally, on a day when the rain was pouring down, Dong finally reached adulthood.It was looking for a half-sibling that was closest to himself on the second continent.Why half of the same kind?Because\u00a0this was also one of the descendants of Lan.It was a\u00a0reptile that looked somewhat like Lan but several generations apart.Basically, it was not even a family.After one year, the descendants of Dong were born.There were a\u00a0total of seven little lives.What surprised Jiang Fan was that, of the\u00a0seven newborns of this generation, six of them were atomic dinosaurs!There was also an untimely death.Dong was a good father.A handful of shit, a handful of urine, and a handful of dedication to raising these children.The six little atomic dinosaurs had a happy and healthy childhood, but the good times didn\u2019t last long.This time, on the other side of the second continent, there was a new race of creatures rising.This was a strange creature with a body shape very much like a python, but with six legs!It never existed on Earth in the\u00a0previous life of Jiang Fan, nor in various film and television series.He went to the Planet Association\u00a0but he couldn\u2019t find any information either.Jiang Fan guessed\u00a0that it should be a product unique to Blue Star.\u201cLet\u2019s call you a six-legged python.\u201dJiang Fan temporarily gave this creature a name.He couldn\u2019t figure out whether it was lizard-like or python-like.In short, it appeared to combine the characteristics of a lizard and a python\u00a0and it became powerful beyond measure.The reproductive capacity of the six-legged python was much better than the atomic dinosaurs.Besides, it actually contained poison as compared to a python.Not a single animal had survived\u00a0that was bitten by a six-legged python.There was still plenty of food in the second continent.The six-legged python was frantically hunting and killing all kinds of prey to grow its race!In fact, the appearance of the six-legged python was earlier than when Jiang Fan threw Lan on this continent.At that time, there were only three or two six-legged pythons\u00a0but after a few generations, by the time of this period of Dong, the colony of six-legged pythons had grown to hundreds!Unlike atomic dinosaurs, a\u00a0descendant of the six-legged python was the six-legged python!Hundreds of six-legged pythons\u00a0frantically swept in the surroundings.It dominated a large part of the land.Although it was a continent,\u00a0it was still small at this time.Every single animal from various races was\u00a0hunted by them\u00a0and became their food.\u201cAh!\u201dA gorilla let out a scream of dismay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Initial shape of the atomic dinosaur! The Ancestor of King Kong! Dong wins!He was bitten by a six-legged python.The last vision of his life\u00a0was that he was staring at his wife, who was far away, and\u00a0his own child, who had just been born not long ago in his wife\u2019s arms, appeared unusually intelligent.The track of the six-legged python\u00a0finally\u00a0stepped on the perimeter of the largest lake.That\u00a0was Dong\u2019s territory at that time.The six-legged python was ferocious\u00a0but it was not simple-minded at all.They were very smart and cunning!After feeling the scent of the atomic dinosaur, the six-legged python didn\u2019t behave as\u00a0it did before.It chose to retreat for the time being\u00a0and sent two of their more agile counterparts to sneak quietly into Dong\u2019s territory.After a lot of twists and turns, two six-legged pythons\u00a0found out about Dong\u00a0and his six children.Dong was still talking to his\u00a0six children at that time.All of them were happy to play the simple and uncomplicated game of throwing stones.The two six-legged pythons observed for a while\u00a0and sneaked back silently.They told the other companions about their findings.The six-legged python seemed to have reached a certain opinion\u00a0and each of them dispersed.They waited for the next day\u00a0and got back together again.After that, they quietly slipped into Dong\u2019s territory again.This time, it was discovered by Dong, who was enjoying the scenery and calming down at the edge of the alley.When Dong saw\u00a0the huge body of the six-legged python, he\u00a0directly used a sliding shovel!The six-legged python was sent flying\u00a0with a single slap.He was so strong!This was the real-time reaction of the other six-legged pythons in the back.The one in the front was definitely not their opponent\u00a0but the six-legged pythons saw that the situation was not good, so they retreated immediately.They\u00a0instantly disappeared into the jungle.After that, Dong ignored these six-legged pythons.He\u00a0went over and cleaned up the wounded six-legged python in a few blows.As for its huge body, he threw it into the lake hard.From here on, this area was a lot quieter.The six-legged pythons never came back.The six-legged pythons in other places also converged, when they saw the great\u00a0power of Dong.Other animals got\u00a0more room to survive because of this.However, it was just the calm before the storm!As the saying goes, one mountain cannot accommodate two tigers.On a small land, how could there be room for two kinds of giant beasts?The six-legged python sunk its teeth into the air, it was quietly looking for the right opportunity.After three years, the opportunity\u00a0was finally there.As the six offspring of Dong had already taken shape.They were\u00a0not adults\u00a0but there was also a trace of domineering and intimidation of atomic dinosaurs!Dong\u2019s discipline was also slowly decreasing.Most of the time, he\u00a0stayed by the lake\u00a0but these days, it was\u00a0found that not far away in the forest, there was always a chicken-and-egg-like movement.With the noises,\u00a0it could not be peace.Dong was unable to bear it\u00a0and\u00a0roared.As he roared, the forest was suddenly silent\u00a0and the birds and beasts trembled with fear.However,\u00a0this deterrence did not last long.Soon, it started to jump around again.Very helpless, it didn\u2019t bother to get up to see what was happening.A few more days passed\u00a0and there was more movement of chickens flying around.There seemed to be a lot of animals, coming from further away!Those who didn\u2019t know thought they were going to the market.Another day\u00a0passed and Dong was keenly aware that the six-legged python was on this continent,\u00a0which\u00a0once made him\u00a0wary and angry -.It was one of the few things that could be a threat to Atomic Dinosaur\u2019s babies!Dong changed his usual Buddhist nature\u00a0and\u00a0rushed straight through.By the time he\u00a0arrived, he\u00a0discovered\u00a0that the six-legged pythons had already hurried away.When they left, there seemed\u00a0to be a red flower in their mouth.Dong glanced around suspiciously\u00a0and found out that there was a deep pond there.Under the deep pond, a\u00a0surprisingly delicate-looking\u00a0red flower was growing!\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201dDong was a bit curious\u00a0but the pond was too deep\u00a0and the entrance was too small.There was simply no room for his\u00a0huge body.Dong could only look at it for a few moments and then give up.Under the deterrence of Dong, most of the animals around had run out\u00a0but there were still a few left that was\u00a0too late to run.A skinny female gorilla\u00a0that was holding a baby gorilla was shivering and hiding on the cliff beside him\u00a0and was waiting for Dong to leave.The female gorilla took a very wary\u2026\u2026 look around.She hugged the little gorilla\u00a0and jumped down into the deep pond.After picking a red flower, she\u00a0flew away.The animals in the back were not so lucky.There was a big battle in the deep pond.Eventually, the few remaining red flowers were taken away and hidden.No one knew exactly what happened except for Jiang Fan who observed this scene.\u201cInteresting.\u201dSeeing this, a\u00a0smile of anticipation appeared on\u00a0the corner of Jiang Fan\u2019s mouth.The evolution of life in the second continent was completely different from the first continent.On the first Continent, most of the species\u00a0were\u00a0still exactly the same as in his previous life.While in\u00a0the second continent, the birth of the species was somewhat unexpected.There were giant brown bears weighing over a thousand kilograms.There were six-legged pythons that looked like lizards and pythons.There were weak but intelligent and very affectionate apes.Jiang Fan guessed\u00a0that even if it was one day, this continent gave birth to a whole new race of intelligence.It was also very possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 : Initial shape of the atomic dinosaur! The Ancestor of King Kong! Dong wins!After the red flower battle, the entire continent\u00a0was quiet for a while\u00a0but what comes around eventually comes around.This time, Jiang Fan\u2019s gaze\u00a0was\u00a0turned to the Xia Kingdom.Xia Kingdom\u2019s technological development over the years was very slow\u00a0as compared to the evolution of life in the second continent.Jiang Fan was not interested\u00a0in the development of medicine and had also embarked on a wrong path.A large amount of money was invested in the ethereal longevity medicine or life-sustaining medicine!Even if this thing\u00a0really existed,\u00a0it was something that could not\u00a0be developed in this era.It\u00a0was like a primitive man trying to build a spaceship that goes to heaven.Besides wasting effort and time, there was no use at all.For the entire Xia Kingdom, the consequences were even more serious.Funding for other disciplines had been significantly reduced\u00a0because the whole country was in a drug-making frenzy!Han was already bedridden\u00a0and was unconscious.At\u00a0this stage, it\u00a0was amazing that it lasted a full three years.It\u00a0was not that Han\u2019s life force was tenacious enough, instead, Han still had an unfulfilled wish!After the competition was over, he\u00a0never saw Jiang Fan again, so his wish was to see Jiang Fan.At a young age,\u00a0Han had also been taught by Jiang Fan for a long time.Jiang Fan was in his heart, except for the reverence of the Father.There was also a deep affection in\u00a0his heart.These years, he had been on his own for a while.He called\u00a0on the name of \u201cFather\u201d\u00a0but Jiang Fan never showed up.The reason\u00a0for this was that Jiang Fan was no longer intended to easily interfere with the development of this world, unless there was a significant change, something like nurturing talent.At Han\u2019s place, the foundations and paving of the way for each discipline had been completed.Next, they could work step by step\u00a0and there was no need to bother.Looking at Han\u2019s white hair and cloudy eyes, Jiang Fan still couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201cForget it, you are also considered my disciple, let\u2019s see you one last time.\u201dJiang Fan appeared\u00a0with a slight vibration of the air.Han\u2019s eyes, who had been staring at the air, suddenly widened.He sat up straight from the bed in disbelief!Jiang Fan knew\u00a0that he was coming back to life.\u201cFather?\u201dHan\u2019s tone trembled slightly, with a look of excitement on his face.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201dJiang Fan sighed gently.Han suddenly burst into tears.First, he\u00a0said in a small child\u2019s voice: \u201cFather, I am ashamed of you!\u201dJiang Fan didn\u2019t say anything.He was quietly waiting for Han to pour out.\u201cI am not a good emperor.\u201dWith tears streaming down his face, he said: \u201cFather left me the foundation, but I\u2026.. failed to carry it forward, and even caused the whole country to fall into a panic. I am sorry for\u00a0all this\u00a0and even more sorry to\u00a0you!\u201dEven after three years in a hospital bed, Han still had a general idea of what was going on outside\u00a0but his orders had gradually been ignored.Those who were out there in the name of making medicine.In fact, they used this flag to achieve their own purposes of various interests!\u201cYou did a great job.\u201dJiang Fan said.Even if Han was\u00a0in old age, he did not make any mistakes.He had been secretly suppressing the expansion of medicine\u00a0and was promoting a balanced development of each discipline.However, Han was not Qi,\u00a0after all, there were\u00a0no such means, nor did he have that reputation!He could only do his best to keep the kingdom moving forward smoothly!Hearing these words of Jiang Fan, a glimmer of light was revealed in Han\u2019s cloudy eyes.After a few moments, Han smiled and said, \u201cI have no more regrets, and when I get to the bottom of the nine springs, I can say to my father that I did my best.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t let go of this country yet.\u201d\u201cFather, please choose a successor!\u201dHan bowed down!\u201cChoose for yourself, and trust your own vision.\u201dJiang Fan said indifferently\u00a0and left.After a long time, no response was heard from Jiang Fan.Han looked out the window into the sky.There was a trace of disappointment on his face.He also seemed to understand something, and muttered to himself, \u201cFather, I understand.\u201dImmediately, Han called the guards.He took a bath,\u00a0summoned a group of ministers and princes once\u00a0again, and publicly announced\u00a0the next heir to the throne!Jiang Fan did not intervene\u00a0but he\u00a0watched this with interest.Han had lived for decades\u00a0and there were many concubines in the harem.The number of sons were\u00a0also very high.In addition, as a result of growing up in\u00a0the military, each one of them was cultivated very well!In this generation, there were actually nine candidates who were perfect for being emperor, no matter which way you look at it!But the emperor would\u00a0only be one after all!Han\u2019s eyes slowly swept across the nine princes.However, there was no ripple in his heart!He knew very well\u00a0that he raised\u00a0some excellent sons.During his own bed rest, they had done a lot of \u201cgood things\u201d that were hidden from him!The reason why the entire Xia Kingdom had become such a mess now, was all because\u00a0of this throne!In order to compete for the status of the heir, the nine candidates were completely unscrupulous!Han\u2019s voice was not loud, and he said slowly.\u201cAfter my death, the next successor to the emperor\u2019s throne will be\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone in the palace knelt on the ground\u00a0and unanimously raised both ears!They didn\u2019t dare to miss a single word!\u201cBai!\u201dAs the word fell, it\u00a0stirred up a thousand waves!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A new type of weapon!\u201cBai!\u201dWhen Han pronounced the name, everyone\u2019s first reaction was\u2026\u2026Did I hear it wrong?It was unbelievable for everyone!Everyone thought that Han was so old and faint that he even mispronounced the name.But one by one, they looked up, seeing the hint of solemn and majestic expression on the face of Han, just to be sure,\u00a0they\u00a0did not hear it wrong.Han was not wrong either.Brush, brush, brush\u2026\u2026For a time, everyone turned their heads and looked at a very inconspicuous young man in the corner.This person was mediocre\u00a0and his appearance was very ordinary.On the streets, he was the kind of person that no one would look at more than once.Even in the luxurious attire of a prince, there was nothing royal about him.Surrounded by people, Prince Bai was stunned and confused.It was not just him, everyone, including the most qualified Grand Tutor was confused.None of them could have guessed.The heir chosen by Han was actually this mediocre guy who couldn\u2019t be more mediocre!\u201cWhy is that?\u201dThe nine most promising princes secretly clenched their fists.They were very confused!Discontent was dissatisfaction\u00a0but Han had been in power for decades.His reputation was there,\u00a0so no one dared to question it on the spot.After a short silence, everyone agreed to leave.Prince\u00a0Bai, who was still very stunned, was left behind.\u201cGet ready, I don\u2019t have much time.\u201dHan looked at Bai and said briefly.\u201cFather\u2026\u2026\u201dBai said hesitantly.\u201cAre you asking me why I chose you instead of your outstanding royal brothers?\u201dHan said calmly: \u201cYou will understand later.\u201dHan didn\u2019t say much.After that, he took\u00a0things as the foundation and governed the country according to law\u00a0and gave a brief set of guidelines to Bai.For Bai, Han was actually not satisfied.He really belonged to the kind of people who had little talent in any field.He was extremely mediocre!Even though he was not\u00a0eligible to inherit the throne,\u00a0Han still chose him.Bai was unremarkable\u00a0but there was one big advantage \u2013That was\u2026\u2026 listening!Han explained the words and policies without the slightest doubt.Bai was nodding all the way through.At night, the Great Desolate City was still bustling with activities.It seemed to be no different from usual\u00a0but under the calm water, the undercurrent was surging!The nine most promising princes\u00a0already gathered their respective people.\u201cWhy would Father choose this loser, Bai? Why? Why?\u201dIn the Eldest Prince\u2019s Mansion, a\u00a0beautifully shaped pottery was slammed to the ground by the eldest prince,\u00a0with a \u201cpop\u201d sound.The people around were silent.There were strategists, ministers, generals and scholars, but none of them answered.From daytime to now, this was something everyone could not understand!Among the nine outstanding princes, the eldest prince was the most prestigious.He was considered the most promising.However\u2026\u2026As the saying goes, the higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment.Han\u2019s announcement today gave the Eldest Prince a heavy blow!\u201cFather, I also admit that I lost to the third and eighth brothers, but\u2026\u2026 in your eyes, I\u2019m not as good as this trash, Bai?\u201dThe eldest prince had a ferocious look on his face, and said bitterly: \u201cFather, you are old, your eyes are faint, and you can\u2019t even see people clearly!\u201d\u201cFor the sake of this country, I also have to make some right choices.\u201dThe others\u00a0present did not respond.Since Han announced the heir position, everyone knew that\u00a0apart from doing some outrageous things, there was no other way around it.\u201cCommander Xing.\u201dThe eldest prince looked at a tall general and asked, \u201cHow many soldiers do you have now?\u201d\u201cAmong the 10,000 troops, there are 5,000 who can follow my command!\u201dCommander Xing answered.The Forbidden Army was a team that guards the palace gates.There were four commanders in total.Each commander had 2,500 members!While\u00a0Commander Xing was the most senior one among them.\u201cThe other 5,000\u2026\u2026\u201dCommander Xing glanced at the eldest prince and continued: \u201cSome were not drawn, and some were drawn by other palaces, but there are not many, so there is nothing to be afraid of!\u201d\u201cThere are also personal guards in the palace!\u201dA strategist reminded, \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s personal guard only has a thousand men, and although they are all elites, they are ultimately few in number.\u201dCommander Xing didn\u2019t take it seriously.\u201cBesides\u2026..\u201dCommander Xing smiled slightly, showing a hint of pride: \u201cThere are also my people in the city guards, but those\u00a0people\u00a0have\u00a0a bigger appetite.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give them\u00a0whatever they want as long as they\u00a0are willing to make a move!\u201dThe eldest prince said abruptly, \u2014 his face was hideous!\u201cWith His Highness\u2019s words, everything will be easy.\u201dCommander Xing said with a smile.\u201cFather, it\u2019s not that your son is not filial, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t know anyone well. This son is thinking about the entire Xia Kingdom.\u201dThe eldest prince muttered to himself.His face suddenly turned cold, a pair of sharp eyes glanced at everyone, and said coldly: \u201cEveryone, prepare to act!\u201d\u201cTonight\u2026\u2026 is the time for\u00a0a change!\u201dThis time, there was a sudden sound of rapid footsteps from outside the house.The voice of a personal guard then sounded-\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s not good, our mansion has been breached!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe eldest prince and the others were shocked!Commander Xing walked over quickly, opened the door, and asked, \u201cWhich army?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Great Desolate Army!\u201dThe personal guards trembled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mountain Range \u2013 the Great Desolate Army, would suddenly mobilize\u00a0and would start killing in\u00a0the Great Desolate City!They surrounded the residences of the nine princes\u00a0and continuously defeated the city guards and the forbidden army that came to support them!That night\u00a0all the heads were rolled.The Great Desolate Army was on a killing spree!The eldest prince and other princes\u00a0were not\u00a0spared!This included everyone under their hand.All of them were killed on the spot!This was the battle for the throne!\u201cThose who are kind-hearted and soft-hearted cannot be good emperors!\u201dHan stood on the high platform of the palace and looked at the fire in the distance.He remembered what Qi once explained!The next day, Han passed away in a deep sleep!Later generations also had a very good opinion of Han.Everyone\u00a0thought that Han\u00a0had\u00a0lost control of the country in the final years\u00a0but before he died, he still showed the means of the emperor.He killed all of his nine sons!It paved the way for the succession of Bai.Under everyone\u2019s shocked gazes, Prince Bai\u00a0officially ascended to the throne!By the generation of Bai, Jiang Fan had not interfered in the slightest.Bai was also unaware of Jiang Fan\u2019s existence.For the Xia Kingdom, a\u00a0new era opened, as Han predicted.Bai was unremarkable, but there was simply no imperial means or ability\u00a0but he was very obedient.He was\u00a0ruling according to the guidelines left by Han!The blind development of medicine was reversed\u00a0and the development of other disciplines\u00a0also started slowly!Bai\u2019s reign was not long.It was only twenty years.During this time, there was\u00a0progress in various subject areas, but unusually\u2026\u2026 slow.This was evident from the size of the population.When Han passed away, the population of the Xia Kingdom exceeded 1.3 million.In twenty years when Bai passed away, only 100,000 more people were added to the previous population!In this period, there were hardly any particularly significant results!In the entire country, nothing much had changed.It remained almost the same as the period of Han and Qi.There were three major colleges for research aspects of technology theory-Kewu College, Medical College and Tian Gong College almost occupied more than 90% of the shares!One could say\u00a0that the only thing that made Jiang Fan\u2019s eyes shine was\u00a0the\u00a0wilderness of the Blue Star.Another brand new metal had been discovered.This metal\u2019s appearance was very similar to iron.The various properties were similar to that\u00a0of iron.However, it was even better than iron!It could be said that it was an upgraded and doubled version of iron!When it was\u00a0sent to the palace, Bai personally named it Star Meteorite iron!The appearance of star meteorite iron\u00a0helped\u00a0the industrial development of the Xia Kingdom to quickly go to a higher level!It replaced iron\u00a0and became part of most weapons.As compared with vibranium, the role of star meteorite iron was not so obvious\u00a0but it was even more essential!Some of the envisioned weapons could finally be created\u00a0by this, like cannons and guns!This was something that many scholars had thought about a long time ago, especially after the big competition.Many scholars were very interested in putting black powder to use.Many scholars\u00a0had envisioned a variety of weapons.But because of the lack of iron ore, these ideas could not be tested!With the death of Qi, an increasing number of scholars were involved in this area of research.The\u00a0weapons made of star meteorite iron\u00a0were naturally more excellent than ordinary iron!\u2026\u2026Inside the Palace, another of the emperor\u2019s greatest problems on his deathbed was\u00a0the choice of heir!Bai leaned on the back of the chair.Weakly, he looked at each of the princes kneeling down.Suddenly, he had a glimmer of clarity as to why Han had chosen him to succeed the throne.Maybe\u2026\u2026In the current Xia Kingdom, he did not need those ambitious people.This kingdom was\u00a0able to move forward naturally and smoothly just by following the steps!However, Bai\u2019s rule was very weak\u00a0but the entire Xia Kingdom\u00a0was still moving forward, over a period of twenty years.It\u00a0was just that this development was not that significant.Thinking about this, Bai also made up his mind.One that was similar to him\u2026\u2026An unremarkable and very inconspicuous prince \u201cYu\u201d was the apparent heir.It\u00a0was just that\u00a0Bai\u00a0did not have\u00a0the vision of Qi and Han.(Thanks for the support from AdamAim and Elleria )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
