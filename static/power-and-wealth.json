Dong Xuebing could not move even his fingers, and it was total darkness. He tried to move his neck, but there was no reaction. He finally mustered all his strength to open his eyes, but he could only open a slit. He could make out a blurry vision of an overloaded dump truck. Beside him, there was an old man in his 70s or 80s and a beautiful woman in her late 20s lying in a pool of blood motionless. There was a crowd of onlookers. From their mouth movements, they seem to be shouting something. However, Dong Xuebing could not hear anything.The old man was dead. Aunt Xuan was dead. He was badly injured\u2026\u2026 Most likely he would not make it.Looking at the pretty face of the woman he secretly admired, Qu Yunxuan, Dong Xuebing felt like his heart was being stabbed by a knife.Neighbour Qu Yunxuan was a kind woman. Earlier at the traffic junction, she saw the old man having difficulties walking and offered her help to help him cross the road. Despite the traffic lights in their favor, a truck came speeding towards them. The driver might be drunk or had fallen asleep on the wheel. Dong Xuebing, who was some distance away saw the danger and came running towards Qu Yunxuan. He wants to push her out of the way of the truck. But he was too late, and he was also knocked down by the truck.Regrets.Dong Xuebing had never regretted so much in his life.If Dong Xuebing noticed the out-of-control truck earlier and rushed out to save them, the 3 of them did not need to die.But now\u2026\u2026 It was too late.Dong Xuebing could feel his eyelids getting heavier and heavier. He could no longer bear to see the twisted bodies or Qu Yunxuan and that old man. He shut his eyes and waited for his time to be up.Kaboom!There was a loud thunderclap. It was so loud that it could shatter someone\u2019s soul.The next moment, Dong Xuebing felt his vision blurred, and he felt jumped out of the darkness.Dong Xuebing could feel his strength, hearings, and vision coming back to him. He was in a dazed and looked around him. He noticed that he was all fine and standing in front of the traffic junction. Around him was the traffic in Beijing. Cars, taxis, and vans were zooming past him. Under the dim lightings of the streetlights, people were walking as if nothing had happened.\u201cSir, let me help you cross the road.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thank you, young lady. I am fine by myself.\u201d\u201cI am just staying opposite, and it is not a hassle. Come, let me help you.\u201dDong Xuebing turned around towards the voice in shock. A smiling Qu Yunxuan was at the pedestrian crossing not far away. She also saw Dong Xuebing and said: \u201cXiao Bing, you are back? Are you out with your friends?\u201d The person beside her was the old man who had just passed away. The old man also looked at Dong Xuebing and coughed.\u201cAh\u2026 Ya\u2026 I am back.\u201d Dong Xuebing was looking around him and answered unconsciously. He was still trying to figure out what had happened.What happened? I am not dead? Aunt Xuan was not dead? The old man was also not dead?Dong Xuebing slowly lifted his hand up and opened his palm. He clenches his fist and then opened it up again. There was no blood or wounds.Was he dreaming? There was no accident? Everything was only a hallucination?The traffic lights changed from red to amber, and then the traffic lights opposite the road turned green and showed the green pedestrian man. The pedestrians start to cross the road. The old man with his walking stick was the slowest, and Qu Yunxuan was helping him to cross the road.This was familiar.This was a very familiar scene.Suddenly, there was the roar of an engine, and Dong Xuebing instantly turned towards the engine sound. A truck was moving on the right turning lane from another road. The truck was overloaded with gravels and was not traveling very fast, at about 40 Km/h or 50 Km/h.Dong Xuebing rubbed his eyes. He was shocked. Wasn\u2019t this the scene before the accident?What was happening? Time had rewinded? That was not a hallucination?Dong Xuebing had no time to think and immediately shouted: \u201cStop, look out for that truck!\u201dEveryone paused for a while and started looking around them.\u201cWhat truck?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the truck?\u201dQu Yunxuan saw that truck and turn to Dong Xuebing: \u201cWhy are you shouting? It\u2019s red light there.\u201dThe old man also felt there was nothing to be worried about. That truck was turning and would not affect them crossing the road.Dong Xuebing knew that this truck will not slow down and will be knocking them down. He immediately ran over while shouting: Aunt Xuan, move! Move away from there!\u201dQu Yunxuan paused for a while and smile: \u201cXiao Bing, what\u2019s wrong with you? That truck is \u2026\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, the truck had crossed the stop line, and there was no indication of the truck slowing down.In front of all the pedestrians at the crossing, the truck beat the red light.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cRun\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to knock someone down!\u201dPeople were shouting.Qu Yunxuan was stunned. When she finally came back to her senses, she immediately pulls that old man: \u201cHurry up. Run!\u201d\u201cLeave me and run by yourself.\u201d The old man gave Qu Yunxuan a push.There was not enough time. The sounds of the roaring engine were getting nearer.4 meters\u2026\u20263 meters\u2026\u2026Qu Yunxuan and that old man had given up hope.When everyone there thought the both of them would be killed by the truck, Dong Xuebing, who knew the truck would be beating the red lights, rushed to the backs of the two of them. Using the momentum, he used all his strength to carry both the old man and Qu Yunxuan by the waist with both his arms outstretched. He continued to run forward with the old man and Qu Yunxuan on his left and right. He roared as he carries on running ahead with all his might and two people hanging on his arms.\u201cShit!\u201d\u201cThey are going to die!\u201dMany of the more timid bystanders closed their eyes.Zoomed\u2026\u2026 The truck brushed just Dong Xuebing\u2019s back with only centimeters to spare.The old man was sent sliding on the road forward for half a meter.Qu Yunxuan was also sent tumbling forward from Dong Xuebing\u2019s push.Dong Xuebing fell the worst. He was gasping for air while lying on his side in the middle of the road. He could feel the pain in his waist and legs.Time seems to be frozen for a while and then there were cheers.\u201cAll of them are still alive!\u201d\u201cYoung man, you are so brave!\u201dIt was not sure who started clapping and soon everyone was clapping and cheering for Dong Xuebing.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

If time had not miraculously rewind, he would not get the chance to see his mother and Aunt Xuan. This was the first time he was grateful for being alive. He fell asleep in the wee hours of the morning, as lots of things were going through his mind. This was why it was 10 plus in the morning when he woke up. He got up from his old squeaking spring couch and headed for the washroom. He washed his face and yawned. He called out at the bedroom: \u201cMum, are you awake?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother, Luan Xiaoping, replied: \u201cI am awake, and I am cleaning up the room. Do you still want breakfast?\u201d\u201cI will wait for lunch.\u201d Dong Xuebing could feel something was off from his mother\u2019s voice. He immediately pushes the door open and saw his mother sitting on the bed. She quickly wipes off her tears with the back of her hands when Dong Xuebing entered the room. His mother turned and looked at him and forced a smile and keeping an old black and white photograph into her wallet. It was her wedding photo, taken more than 20 years ago.Dong Xuebing could feel his heart aching as he sat down beside his mother: \u201cThinking of dad?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m not.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother carefully kept the wallet and rubbed her eyes. \u201cI took it out for a look when I saw it while cleaning.\u201dThis had happened countless times over the years. Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother character was weak. Every time she remembers some unpleasant memories, she would hide in her room and cry. Dong Xuebing felt guilty and said: \u201cMum, it is all my fault for being so useless. I cannot study and do not have any skills. I don\u2019t think I will pass the Civil Servant test. All I can do is to work part-time at Panjiayuan Antique Market during my holidays. If I was slightly more capable, I might have raised enough medical bills for dad, and he might still be around.\u201dHis mother patted his legs: \u201cStop talking nonsense. I know my son is the most capable and he will be a top government official in the future.\u201dDong Xuebing moved his lips but did not say anything.His mother smiled and touch his hand: \u201cDon\u2019t think so much. I will make you a good lunch later.\u201dA plate of stir-fried garlic pork, a plate of steam cabbage and half a pot of congee. This was considered a luxurious meal in Dong Xuebing\u2019s household. Usually, when he was alone at home, he would not bear to eat such dishes. He would just cook some rice and stir-fry some vegetables and eat it for lunch and dinner. It was not because Dong Xuebing was thrifty. It was because his family was really poor.Dong Xuebing was 23 years\u2019 old and was a graduate.He had average looks and height. Everything about him was ordinary.The savings at home was not more than 5 figures.During the year when Dong Xuebing\u2019s father was hospitalized, they had used up all their savings. In the end, they even have to sell away their house. The one-bedroom apartment they were living was rented. After his father passed away, his mother lost her job for taking too much time off. The living expenses in Beijing was too high, and his mother returned back to her hometown in the countryside to work as a teacher there. She was trying her best to earn enough money for Dong Xuebing\u2019s university\u2019s fees. She will only return to Beijing to be with her son for one or two months during the school holidays.All the living expenses, rents, bills, etc. depended on Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother miserable salary, which was not enough. This was why Dong Xuebing took out part-time jobs as cashiers in supermarkets or some odd jobs at the Antique Market during his holidays and weekends. Other than his school fees, he was paying everything else. He could make his own living without asking for money from his mother.Life was tough, but 4 years had passed in a flash.After lunch, Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother kept the dishes and watched some old black and white programs on the TV. Dong Xuebing returned back to the bedroom and lay there staring at the ceiling in a daze. Now, all the universities in Beijing no longer provide a job for their graduates. He had just graduated from Beijing Union University. What will he do if he fails his Civil Servant test?Sigh\u2026\u2026 how good will it be if I really have supernatural powers?But I had tried so many times last night and did not succeed even once.Shall I try again?The door creak and opened. Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother came in and said gently: \u201cI will be going upstairs to speak to Mrs. Xu. I heard that her son will be taking the Civil Servant test this year at the same location as you. I want to see if she can ask her son to help you out with your revisions. Xiao Dong is good with his studies.\u201dDong Xuebing felt uncomfortable in his chest and mumbled a reply.\u201cI will be back later.\u201d She said and closed the door.Dong Xuebing gritted his teeth and calm himself down before he starts on his experiments.Turn back! Move back! Retreat! Back!Dong Xuebing felt his body moved, but when he looked around, there were no changes. Fine. Those were not the magic words.Just when Dong Xuebing was about to start to say some random words, the bedroom door opened.His mother came in and looked at him: \u201cI will be going upstairs to speak to Mrs. Xu. I heard that her son will be taking the Civil Servant test this year at the same location as you. I want to see if she can ask her son to help you out with your revisions. Xiao Dong is good with his studies.\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned and shouted: \u201cAh?\u201dIt was exactly the same tone and words.This was what just happened 50 to 60 seconds ago.Seeing her son\u2019s reaction, she said softly: \u201cMum knows that you have your pride, but her son, Xiao Dong had almost scored full marks for his exams last year. If he can help you with your revisions, you might stand a better chance of passing.\u201dDong Xuebing replied in a daze: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u201dHis mother looked at him and said: \u201cThen I will be going.\u201dAfter his mother left, Dong Xuebing gave himself a slap. That\u2019s it! I succeeded!Dong Xuebing quickly suppress his excitement and grabbed a small orange-colored alarm clock from the shelves. He stared at the hands of the clock and begin to repeat the \u201cmagic words.\u201dTurn back! Move back! Retreat! Back!Dong Xuebing continued to chant these words from afternoon till night. After dinner, he continued chanting the words. Finally, at 12.02 am 28 seconds, he successfully made a move back the time and returned to 12.01 am 28 seconds. It was precisely 1 minute!No words could explain the excitement Dong Xuebing had.Dong Xuebing knew that the time on this alarm clock was not accurate and he ran over to switch on the old 29in TV.A military program was on and the time was shown on the top right corner. 23: 59: 19.Switching on the Tv should take about 19 seconds. That means when Dong Xuebing uses \u201cBack\u201d just now, it was exactly midnight. He blinked and made a bold hypothesis. This \u201cBack\u201d will reset at midnight, and he can only use it once a day. When he uses it, time will return back to 60 seconds before.Oh my god!!!If this was indeed real, lady luck had smiled on him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dong Xuebing helped his mother to cut some celeries and then he had nothing to do. He went out to the living room and watch TV. Dong Xuebing was hoping that time will pass faster that day. He can\u2019t wait for the day to be over to try to turn back time. If he could no longer control the time again, he would be happy for nothing.Ding Dong. Ding Dong.Someone was ringing the doorbell.Dong Xuebing opened the door, and there was a hint of perfume. Through the gates, he could see a beautiful face. It was Qu Yunxuan from unit 302 next door. Big eyes, long lashes, and fair complexion. She was gorgeous. Qu Yunxuan was wearing light colored office attire. Her tight skirt showed her perky ass. Her sexy long legs were in skin colored stockings with a pair of white heels. She had the attractiveness of a matured woman.\u201cErmmm\u2026. Please come in.\u201d Dong Xuebing dares not to look at Qu Yunxuan any longer and hurriedly let her in.\u201cHee hee. I am here for a visit.\u201d Qu Yunxuan walked in with her pair of alluring long legs. Click, click. The sounds of placing heels on the floor sounded so lovely.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother walked out of the kitchen: \u201cYunxuan, you are here? Is today your rest day?\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at the kitchen and answered: \u201cI have one off day today. Sister Luan is cooking lunch now? Stop cooking. Come over to my place with Xiao Bing later for lunch.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother immediately refused: \u201cNo need, no need. I am done with the ingredients.\u201dQu Yunxuan thought for a while and said: \u201cThen\u2026\u2026 I had bought some fresh vegetables and meat. I will bring everything over and cook some dishes, and we can have lunch together.\u201d Before Dong Xuebing and his mother could say anything, Qu Yunxuan walked out and returned with meat and vegetables. She also took out a white shirt from a bag and held it against Dong Xuebing. Qu Yunxuan smiles, flashing her dimple: \u201cAunt had bought this shirt for you. I am not sure if it\u2019s fit. Hmmm\u2026\u2026 It should look good on you. Hurry try it on now. If it does not fit, I can change it to another size.\u201dDong Xuebing embarrassedly said: \u201cHow can I let you buy me a shirt? You don\u2019t need to buy me anything.\u201dQu Yunxuan blinked her eyes and playfully flicked Dong Xuebing\u2019s nose: \u201cHurry and change into it.\u201dIn the past, Qu Yunxuan would never have such actions when both of them were talking. Dong Xuebing blushed. But when he thought about being so close with the woman of his dreams, he could hardly contain his excitement. Dong Xuebing took off his t-shirt and changed into the white shirt.Qu Yunxuan smiled and helped him with his buttons: \u201cHmmm\u2026 quite fitting.\u201dVirtuous, caring and gentle. These were the words that represented Qu Yunxuan.Although Dong Xuebing addressed her as Aunt Xuan, Qu Yunxuan was only older than him by a few years. She was still single. However, she was very matured. When Dong Xuebing\u2019s father passed away, and his mother returned back to the countryside to teach, Dong Xuebing was left alone in this rented apartment. It was Qu Yunxuan\u2019s smile that gave him hope, and she accompanied him through the most challenging phase of his life. Qu Yunxuan would drop by his unit every few days to chat, console, encourage with him, and sometimes give him some home cook food. Dong Xuebing was grateful to her and slowly developed feelings for her. But he knew that he was not good enough for this beautiful woman. He could only keep his feelings to himself and did not tell anyone about this.When Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother saw Qu Yunxuan helping her son wear the shirt, she felt it was weird. She knew that when she was not in Beijing, Qu Yunxuan would sometime cook for her son. But this was very common among neighbors. Helping each other out are the duties of neighbors.But Qu Yunxuan was too helpful, and Luan Xiaoping felt weird.Could it be that Qu Yunxuan was interested in her son? Impossible. Both Qu Yunxuan and her son were not a good match. Even though Dong Xuebing was her son, but Luan Xiaoping got to admit that her son was not good enough for Qu Yunxuan and Qu Yunxuan would not fall for her son for no reason. Luan Xiaoping was well aware of where she and her son stands. When she thought about this, she looked at the both of them suspiciously: \u201cYunxuan, you have brought so much food over and still buy Xiaobing a shirt\u2026\u2026 Why are you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cXiao Bing, you did not tell Sis Luan about it?\u201d Qu Yunxuan moved closer to Dong Xuebing.\u201cYa.\u201d Dong Xuebing was scared that his mother would get worried and he did not tell her about the accident.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother asked: \u201cWhat happened?\u201dQu Yunxuan sighed, and tears start to well up in her eyes: \u201cThe day before yesterday, at the cross junction downstairs, an old man and I were nearly knocked down by a truck. Luckily Xiao Bing rushed over and saved us both. You did not see what happened. It was too dangerous. We almost\u2026\u2026\u201d Tears start to fall. She could not continue. During the accident, her mind was completely blank when the truck was closing in. Her legs were rooted to the ground, and she thought that she would be dead for sure. Qu Yunxuan did not expect Dong Xuebing to rush in and save her in such a dangerous situation. She was really shocked by what happened.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother jumped: \u201cSomething like this happened?\u201dQu Yunxuan wiped her tears and patted the back of Dong Xuebing's head. She pursed her red lips and said: \u201cXiao Bing, I will not say how much I thank you for saving me. In the future, you will be my younger brother. Sister Luan, you should not treat me as an outsider too. If you and Xiao Bing need any help in the future, just let me know.\u201dDong Xuebing said: \u201cAiya\u2026\u2026 you do not need to do this.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qu Yunxuan glanced at him: \u201cYou think I am not good enough to be your older sister?\u201dDong Xuebing immediately wave his hand: \u201cNo, no. That is not what I meant.\u201d Why do you want to be my older sister and not my wife? Dong Xuebing grumbled in his heart.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother realized the seriousness of this accident and asked more about the details. She tapped Qu Yunxuan\u2019s hand and said: \u201cWow\u2026 it was indeed very dangerous. Luckily all of you are alright. Yunxuan, you have been helping me take care of Xiao Bing these few years. We had never treated you as an outsider. Nowadays, it is rare to find such a sweet and caring woman. It is Xiao Bing\u2019s fortune to have someone like you to be his sister.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother really likes this gentle Qu Yunxuan. She was more than willing to be closer to Qu Yunxuan as she would be returning to the countryside next month. She would not worry too much if there was someone in Beijing looking after her son.Qu Yunxuan moved slightly towards her right, closer to Dong Xuebing and stroke his head: \u201cDon\u2019t say that. It\u2019s my honor.\u201d Her thighs had touched Dong Xuebing\u2019s knee. Her smooth skin colored stockings felt really good and tempting.Dong Xuebing was feeling antsy and to hide his embarrassment, he moved his head and rolled his eyes: \u201cAunt Xuan, I remembered that you are only older than me by a few years. Can you stop patting me on my head?\u201d Although Dong Xuebing said that, he really like the way Aunt Xuan stroke and patted his head.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother and Qu Yunxuan burst out laughing.After a while, Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother and Qu Yunxuan went into the kitchen together to cook.They had lunch together, and Qu Yunxuan insisted on doing the dishes.In the afternoon, when Dong Xuebing and his mother were not noticing, Qu Yunxuan took a rag and start wiping the windows.That evening, Qu Yuxuan insisted on washing the dishes again. No matter what Dong Xuebing and his mother said, it was no use.7.30 pmQu Yunxuan washed the bubbles off her hands and walked out of the kitchen: \u201cAll the dishes are clean. I will go back first.\u201dDong Xuebing was worried that she would be too tired: \u201cOk. You should hurry to go back and rest. You have been busy the whole day.\u201d\u201cYour Aunt does not have lots of hobbies and cooking, doing household chores can be considered as my hobbies. Hee hee\u2026. How can doing something I like be tired?\u201d Qu Yunxuan\u2019s smile was as sweet as candy. She removed the apron she was wearing and walked into the restroom. When she came out, she was holding a plastic basin full of dirty laundry. Those were all Dong Xuebing\u2019s clothes he worn yesterday. \u201cYour mother\u2019s back is not very good and should not be tiring herself. I will help you wash these clothes and return to you tomorrow after they are dry.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother immediately said: \u201cHow can we let you do this? Xiao Bing can wash his own clothes.\u201dDong Xuebing was blushing and rushed forward to try to snatch that basin of laundry from her: \u201cI can wash it by myself.\u201dQu Yunxuan did not listen and hold on to the basin. When she saw Dong Xuebing refusing to let go of the basin, she laughed and raised one hand. She acted like she was going to hit people: \u201cI will punch you. Hurry up and let go of the basin. If it was someone else, you think I will help to wash their laundry? I just want to help you have more time to prepare for your Civil Servant test.\u201d Qu Yunxuan forcefully snatched the basin and returned to her unit.Dong Xuebing was feeling very embarrassed. His underwear and socks were still in the basin.But despite feeling embarrassed, Dong Xuebing was also grateful for what happened. If he were slightly slower on that day of the accident, he would not see Qu Yunbing\u2019s beautiful smile today, and he would be facing a cold and motionless dead body. He would regret his whole life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a gloomy day, and it felt cooler than the previous few days.Dong Xuebing woke up and remembered that his underwear and socks were still at Aunt Xuan\u2019s house. He felt uncomfortable and hurriedly went to unit 302 to press on the doorbell. Aunt Xuan was the woman he secretly admired, and he wanted to show her the best side of him. He did not want her to see his underwear and smelly socks. If he had known about this, he would fight with his life to stop Aunt Xuan from taking away all the dirty laundry. He was hoping that Aunt Xuan still had not washed those clothes.Clicked. The door opened. \u201cOh, it\u2019s Xiao Bing. I am just about to go to work. Come in.\u201dQu Yunxuan was staying alone, and her house has a pleasant smell. It was the smell of a single woman\u2019s room. The living room was neat and clean. There was not even a spark of dirt on the windows. Dong Xuebing entered the house and embarrassedly rubbed his nose. He was blushing: \u201cErmmm, my clothes\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Yunxuan was bending over to wear her socks and heels. She looked up and laughed. She pointed towards the washroom with her chin: \u201cYour clothes are hanging in the washroom. I had washed them yesterday, and it might still be wet. What\u2019s wrong? Are you in a hurry to wear those clothes? You need me to help you dry the clothes with a hairdryer?\u201d She was squatting down on one leg, and the other was rise higher, showing a gap between her legs in the office skirt.Dong Xuebing faced turned redder: \u201cAh\u2026 No need. I will bring my clothes back to dry them. Thank you.\u201dQu Yunxuan rolled her eyes: \u201cDo you need to be so formal with me? If we want to talk about thanking, I should be the one who should be thanking you.\u201dQu Yunxuan was standing outside the restroom while Dong Xuebing rushed in to collect his clothes. His t-shirt and pants were hanging on a rack, and his underwear and socks were hanging from a hanger behind. Dong Xuebing immediately grab all his clothes. He could imagine Qu Yunxuan\u2019s soft hands scrubbing his underwear. He felt embarrassed.Dong Xuebing had lost focus, and he only wanted to quickly return home with his clothes. Suddenly, he realized he was holding on to a skin-colored lacy panty. Damn! I took the wrong one. This was not my underwear. Dong Xuebing slapped his forehead. He had taken Qu Yunxuan\u2019s underwear by mistake. His hand was shaking as he held the lacy underwear in his hand. He was excited and nervous. He could feel the soft and wet material of the underwear. He looked at the underwear closely.This was Qu Yunxuan\u2019s underwear\u2026\u2026It was so beautiful\u2026\u2026When Dong Xuebing was still in a daze, staring at the lacy underwear, a head appeared at the door of the washroom. \u201cHurry up and take your clothes. I need to leave for my work\u2026\u2026\u201d Before the sentence was finished, Qu Yunxuan saw Dong Xuebing holding her underwear, and she blushed.Dong Xuebing almost fainted. His first reaction was to throw the underwear into the washing machine. \u201cAunt Xuan, it is not what you are thinking.Qu Yunxuan was giving him a look and did not say anything.That\u2019s it. Dong Xuebing knew his good impressions he had left with Aunt Xuan was gone. He tried to explain: \u201cIt is really not what you are thinking. I had grabbed the wrong\u2026\u2026\u201d He could not give a good explanation. He suddenly remembered that he still had not used his time control today. He immediately shouted: \u201cBACK!\u201d\u2026\u2026Sceneries were flying.The next moment, Dong Xuebing saw his outstretched hand in mid-air. He was about to grab that skin colored underwear from the metal hanger.This was precisely what happened one minute ago.He had successfully turn back the time again.He immediately stopped his hand/ He was relieved and grabbed his clothes before walking out of the washroom. \u201cAunt Xuan, I am going back now.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed: \u201cIf you have dirty laundry in the future, pass it to me. I will help you wash.\u201dPhwee\u2026. So close.When Dong Xuebing returned home, he tried to use Back a few more times but was unsuccessful.It seems that he could only use this power once a day.Alright! I am going to be rich!Breakfast was the leftover porridge from last night\u2019s dinner, an egg and a small plate of preserved vegetables. Recently, the price of eggs had increased. Dong Xuebing and his mother do not bear to eat eggs for some days. Dong Xuebing was swallowing his saliva as he carefully peels the shells off the egg.\u201cMrs. Xu might be dropping by later.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother said. \u201cHow is your revision for the Civil Servant test?\u201d\u201cSo-so.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s good mood was all gone. He sighed: \u201cI don\u2019t think I will do well. You also know that I have never been good with my studies.\u201d After graduating from the University, Dong Xuebing had not been working. One reason was that he needs to prepare for the Civil Servant test. Another reason was he had graduated from an average school. His results were also average. The chances of him passing and becoming a civil servant were very slim. It can be considered almost impossible.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. If you did not pass this time, there is always the next time. If you really can\u2019t enter the government agencies, then just get a job in the meantime.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother held his hand. \u201cYou will surely pass it one day.\u201dFacing the expectations of his mother, Dong Xuebing could feel the stress. \u201cI\u2026\u2026 I will try my best.\u201dSighed\u2026. Civil Servant.Nowadays, there was fierce competition in the government service. Can he really enter the government service? No matter how Dong Xuebing thinks, he felt it was impossible. He knew his chances were very slim. His university classmates, who had better scores and smarter than him, could not even pass the test. Other than the written test, there was still an interview. Also if one had passed both the test and interview, the department that was being applied would take only one person. The chances for one to be selected was extremely slim.Knock, knock, knock. Someone was knocking on the door.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother immediately grabbed him over to the door. Two people were standing at the door. One was a woman in her 40s, and the other was a bespectacled young man in his 20s. They were Dong Xuebing\u2019s neighbors, Mrs. Xu and her son, Xiao Dong. Behind them, a middle-aged man was walking down from the fourth floor. He had a big belly and looked at some leaders.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother saw him and immediately greeted that man: \u201cSection Chief Xu, are you going to work?\u201dDong Xuebing also greeted them: \u201cMr. and Mrs. Xu.\u201dSection Chief Xu had an air of arrogance. He nodded and continued walking down the stairs without saying a single word.Mrs. Xu shouted to Section Chief Xu from his back: \u201cYour son\u2019s test is nearing. Remember to come home early tonight. We will be eating out.\u201dSection Chief Xu and Mrs. Xu were husband and wife. He had been recently promoted and was now a section chief at the customs. It was not sure if he was a deputy section chief or the section chief. But he had been doing well in his job. However, Dong Xuebing does not like this family. Especially that Section Chief Xu. He seems to be used to ordering people around and very arrogant. He had never looked at people in the eyes. His eyes seem to be on top of his head.When Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother let Mrs. Xu and her son enter the house, Dong Xuebing heard one of his neighbor greeting Section Chief Xu downstairs.\u201cOh, Section Chief Xu, why are you so early today?\u201d\u201cChief Xu, thank you for your help. Can I have the honor to treat you today?\u201dSomeone was bootlicking him.Dong Xuebing was thinking in his heart. Being a government official was good. If only I could be a civil servant.After closing the door, Dong Xuebing returned to the living room. His mother had taken out their best tea leaves in the house. She poured two cups of tea for Mrs. Xu and Xiao Dong. But these \u201cbest tea leaves\u201d were only the best for him and his mother. Mrs. Xu and her son do not think so. Mrs. Xu took a sip and frowned. She placed the tea back on the table and never touch it again. \u201cXiao Ping, I heard that your son will also be taking the test on the 15th? Is he confident of passing?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother pulled him over and sighed: \u201cI do not have high hopes. How about Xiao Dong?\u201dXiao Dong pushed his spectacles. He was holding on to the revision materials and did not say a word. He was also very arrogant like his father.Mrs. Xu laughed proudly: \u201cXiao Dong will surely pass. Last year\u2019s national exams he did not put in his best. The essay questions were too simple, and he could not show his true capabilities. He had been studying seriously this year. It should not be a problem for him to be among the top.\u201d After pausing a while, Mrs. Xu lowered her voice and proudly said: \u201cI will just tell you and no one else. His father had made arrangements with the Customs. As long as Xiao Dong can pass the interview, the customs will recruit him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Your son will have a bright future.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother enviously said. She moved closer to Mrs. Xu and asked: \u201cIf Xiao Dong is not busy, can he help Xiao Bing with his revision?\u201dXiao Dong did not want to come over with his mother. When he heard Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother request, he immediately said rudely: \u201cMum, I do not have the time.\u201dDong Xuebing saw him speaking so rudely to his mother, he got furious: \u201cYou think I have the time for you?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother became nervous and gave Dong Xuebing a light push with her elbow: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Can\u2019t you be nice to others?\u201dThe mood in the room was awkward. Mrs. Xu laughed softly and said: \u201cActually, there is no need for Xiao Bing to enter take the civil servant test so urgently. I know many graduates started work outside for a few years before taking the test. With the experiences they accumulated when working, it will help them with the test. How can someone without experiences pass the test? Look at how many graduates are recruited into the Civil Service? The percentage is lesser than 0.1%.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother smiled and did not say a word.Dong Xuebing was thinking in his heart. Are you looking down on me? How do you know I cannot pass the test?He could tell that Mrs. Xu had brought her son over to show off.Half an hour later, Mrs. Xu left with her son. Before leaving the house, Xiao Dong looked at Dong Xuebing coldly and then left. To him, he felt that Dong Xuebing\u2019s family was too poor and he was just a loser. Dong Xuebing might even have problems securing a job. These were the people who were destined to be at the lowest level of society for their whole life. This person was not worth his time.Noon.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother went back to her room for a nap, while Dong Xuebing was looking through a stack of past year essay questions in the living room. He was doing his best to prepare for the test. But after studying for a while, he knew that there was no way he could pass the test. He might not even reach the minimum score. He was wasting his time revising.Dong Xuebing suddenly heard someone speaking softly.The sound came from inside the house, but Dong Xuebing could not make out what that person was saying.Dong Xuebing followed the sounds, and it was coming from the bedroom. He slowly turned the doorknob and opened a slit.He saw his mother holding on to his father\u2019s black and white photograph. She was crying silently. \u201cWhy her son gets to enter the government service and my son can\u2019t? Dear, you must watch over our son and help him pass the test. If our son can enter the government service, I\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t mind giving up a few years of my life.\u201d\u201cMum\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing opened the door and walked in.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother saw her son had caught her crying again and she quickly wiped her tears: \u201cI am fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dStanding in front of his mother, Dong Xuebing gritted his teeth and said: \u201cYou do not need to worry. I will surely pass the test even if it cost my life!\u201d Seeing how sad his mother was, Dong Xuebing was determined to pass the test. Why other people\u2019s families were all government officials and their children can also be government officials, and he has to be a commoner? He could not even afford to give his mother a better life?I also have a head on my shoulders like others. In what way am I inferior to them?Dong Xuebing must pass the test and become a civil servant.This time, Dong Xuebing was determined to prove himself and make his mother proud!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since Dong Xuebing had promised his mother, he had to do his best.After dinner, Dong Xuebing returned to his room and started to go through all the cupboards and drawers, looking for something. He found a stack Optically answer sheet and a stack of writing papers from under his bed. He had used these Optically answer sheets during his high school days. he placed the sheets and paper on his desk and prepared his stationaries, like eraser and 2B pencils. He started training his memory. ABCD, 1234\u2026\u2026This was the only way Dong Xuebing could pass the Civil Servant Test. Although the chances of him passing was less than 20%, he was determined to try.The next morning.Dong Xuebing woke up on the couch among the stacks of answer sheets. He immediately continued practising. \u201cAABDDCCABDC\u2026\u2026\u201d He closed his eyes and started to rattle off the answers from his mind.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother felt he was being weird and asked: \u201cXuebing, what are you doing?\u201dDong Xuebing coughed and replied: \u201cPreparations.\u201dHis mother looked at him: \u201cDidn\u2019t you bought the revision materials for the test? Why are you looking at those old answer sheets?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 don\u2019t mind me. I know what to do.\u201d If Dong Xuebing could still use Back on the day of the test, all his efforts will not be wasted.Practice\u2026 Practice\u2026 Practice\u2026One hour\u2026 Two hours\u2026 3 hours\u2026Ring, ring, ring. Dong Xuebing\u2019s handphone rang. He took a look at the caller ID and it was an unknown number. \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cHi, are you Xiao Dong?\u201d The caller asked. He sounded quite old.\u201cYes, you are\u2026?\u201d\u201cMy surname is Hu.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cOh\u2026 You are Grandpa Hu? How\u2019s your health?\u201d\u201cThanks for asking. I am feeling good. Haha\u2026 are you busy today? If you are free, can you come over to the hospital to accompany me?\u201d\u201cHuh? Sorry, I am taking the Civil Servant test in a few days. I am still doing my revisions.\u201dThe other party on the phone sounded a bit surprised: \u201cYou are taking the Civil Servant test? Did you register earlier this year in Beijing for this test?\u201d There was a slight pause. Grandpa Hu continued: \u201cHmmm\u2026 if you do not have confident with the written test, come and look for me at the Cancer Hospital\u2019s Oncology ward. Don\u2019t think I am old, I am able to teach you about the techniques to answer the written test, especially the essay questions. Are you interested?\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned. \u201cAh\u2026. Really?\u201d\u201cOf course. Do you think this old man will lie to someone who had saved his life?\u201dDong Xuebing had found the way to handle the multiple-choice questions. But hhe was not confident on the essay questions. \u201cAlright. I will go over now. Thank you.\u201dAfter hanging up, Dong Xuebing told his mother where he was going and ran out with his materials and books.Beijing Cancer Hospital.Dong Xuebing was not working for some time, and he did not have much savings left. On the way to the hospital, he bought some cheap fruits from a roadside stall. At the hospital, he asked around and found the ward. It was ward 3016. He stood outside the ward and knocked on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201d On a bed near the window, Grandpa Hu was looking at a photograph with his reading glass.Dong Xuebing walked over and place the fruits on the side table. \u201cGrandpa Hu, I wish you a speedy recovery.\u201d\u201cYou should not waste your money.\u201d Grandpa Hu smiled and pull Dong Xuebing to sit down. He touched his family photo and showed Dong Xuebing. \u201cThis is my eldest son, and this is my daughter. This is my youngest son and his wife.\u201d The woman in the picture was pregnant. \u201csighed\u2026. I almost miss the chance to see my new-born grandson. Xiao Dong, thanks for pulling me back from hell that day. I really want to thank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201dTears start to well up in Grandpa Hu\u2019s eyes: \u201cThere is no hope for my lung cancer. Sometimes I feel like I should just die earlier. But when I was almost killed, I realized that I can\u2019t let go. I still want to live.\u201dDong Xuebing had changed both Grandpa Hu and Qu Yunxuan\u2019s fate that day, and he was also deeply moved.After some pleasantries, Grandpa Hu suddenly said: \u201cShow me your revision materials for the test. Which part of this you are unclear about? I will explain it to you.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately asked some questions about the areas where he does not understand.Grandpa Hu thought for a while and answered: \u201cIf you answer this question this way, your answer will be too subjective. It is not a good answer. After all, this is not an argument. There will be bound to have mistakes here and there. The markers might deduct your marks with your answer.\u201dDong Xuebing did not understand and asked: \u201cHow should I answer this question then? Paint a good picture? Answer in a high-sounding way?\u201dGrandpa Hu laughed: \u201cXiao Dong, don\u2019t look down on being \u2018Fake, Lies, Empty Promises.\u2019 It is not easy to master this art. If you learned this, you would be able to score points in your answers. When you need to be fake, you got to be fake. When you need to lie, you got to lie. When you need to make empty promises, you got do that. This does not apply only to the Civil Servant entry test. Even when you become a government official, you need to use this too. Come\u2026 Let this old man explain this to you\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing listened the whole afternoon attentively.Grandpa Hu was very knowledgeable. His explanations were clear and easy to understand.After a few hours, Dong Xuebing got more comfortable with Grandpa Hu. He was able to talk freely. \u201cSighed\u2026 The person who set these questions is too much. Why did he set such difficult questions? Is he trying to make things difficult for us?\u201d Dong Xuebing grumbled. \u201cI had practiced the past year's questions and noticed that the questions were getting harder and harder each year. It is easy for the one who set these questions. He just moves his mouth. But we are the ones who are suffering. Who did we offend?\u201dGrandpa Hu frowned and did not say a word.\u201cHuh?\u201d Dong Xuebing was shocked. Did I say the wrong thing?After a while, Grandpa Hu said: \u201cYou should not be saying these. If these questions are easy, then what\u2019s the use of having this test? There will only be one or two vacancies, and if all the candidates scored full marks, they would still have to compete with each other. It will still be the same.\u201d Grandpa Hu flipped open a reference book and pointed to the page: \u201cMy son and I are scholars. But he is more capable than me and had become a professor years ago. Look, he is the one who set most of last year\u2019s Shanghai Civil Servant Test\u2019s essay questions.\u201dDong Xuebing realized that when he grumbled about the person who set the questions, he had also scolded Grandpa Hu\u2019s son indirectly.Shit. Me and my big mouth\u2026\u2026Oh yes, I still have not use \u201cBack\u201d today.Back!\u2026\u2026The time returned back to one minute ago. Dong Xuebing could feel his mouth moving. He should be in the middle of saying something. Grandpa Hu who was listening to him frowned. Dong Xuebing looked at his facial expression and knew that he had used Back too late. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 Grandpa Hu, where did I stop?\u201dGrandpa Hu smiled weakly and said: \u201cYou are saying that the one who set these questions is making things difficult for you all.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Dong Xuebing immediately thought of how to continue. \u201cMaking things difficult for all of us.\u201dGrandpa Hu knitted his brows.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing continued and picked up the revision book who contains all the past years\u2019 questions. \u201cBut two years ago, Beihe Province and last year\u2019s Shanghai questions was quite meaningful. Look at the questions. Although it is difficult, but from the questions, you will know that the person who set these questions have a higher standard of education. If I encounter these questions during this year\u2019s test, I will have no grumbles even if I can\u2019t answer them.\u201dGrandpa Hu stared blankly at him for a while and burst out laughing: \u201cXiao Dong\u2026 I will tell you something. My son is the one who set the essay questions for last year\u2019s Shanghai essay questions.\u201dDong Xuebing pretended to be surprised: \u201cAh?\u201d\u201cMy son is more capable than me.\u201d Grandpa Hu stroked his beard and smilingly said: \u201cHaha. Xiao Dong, I will teach you how to answer essay questions, and I promise you will score high marks.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.

He had used Back 3 times for his test preparations. He tried several methods and angles while using Back. He needs to get used to the feeling of turning back time and become more familiar with this power.Time flies, and it was the day before the test.Beijing Cancer Hospital, Oncology ward.Dong Xuebing continued to study under Grandpa Hu. Grandpa Hu\u2019s son was the examiner in Shanghai, and Grandpa Hu seemed to have the experienced and had researched into these essay questions. This was why Dong Xuebing forced himself to memorize everything he said and listened attentively. The lessons had changed from Dong Xuebing asking questions, to Grandpa Hu asking questions and Dong Xuebing answering them. The questions asked by Grandpa Hu was not from the materials. It was not sure where he got those questions. Sometimes, Grandpa Hu would tell him about the rules and responsibilities of the various government departments. This was to let Dong Xuebing understand what the duties of a Civil Servant were.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The data presented to you is about our citizens misbehaving while on holiday overseas. Using the data, write a suggestion to the head of the Tourism Bureau. The required answer needs to be relevant and implementable. It needs to be concise and not more than 400 words. Try to answer it.\u201dDong Xuebing starts to answer.Grandpa Hu shook his head and pointed out where he got it wrong and then told him the answer in his mind.Dong Xuebing wanted to write Grandpa Hu\u2019s answer down, but he was stopped by Grandpa Hu. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to record it down. You need to understand the general direction of my answer and the important points in the argument. Once you understand the answer, you will automatically remember the answer. Do you still have any questions? Good. I will give you one more question to test you. China has rich resources in the surrounding sea, but our Per capita income is low. Bo Sea is China\u2019s biggest inland sea. It is crucial to the economies of the Northeast region\u2026\u2026\u201dAfternoon.Grandpa Hu coughed and asked: \u201cDid you remember everything?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Dong Xuebing quickly pass a few pieces of tissues to Grandpa Hu.Grandpa Hu smiled and patted Dong Xuebing on his arm: \u201cYour friends and classmates are also taking this test in Beijing with you? Keep everything I taught you to yourself. Don\u2019t tell your classmates. Hahaha. This old man\u2019s knowledge is limited, and that\u2019s everything I can teach you.\u201d\u201cYou are too modest. I really learned a lot from you.\u201d Dong Xuebing rubbed his nose embarrassedly and continued: \u201cI do not have many friends as I did not stay at my university. The classmates I knew were not interested in being a civil servant. They had already found jobs in the private sector. I am the only one still dreaming of entering the government service. Sorry for troubling you the past few days. I really appreciate your help. Thank you.\u201dBefore Dong Xuebing left, Grandpa Hu patted his shoulder and said: \u201cDo well for the test. China\u2019s future will depend on you youngsters.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded.North Heping Street.Dong Xuebing walked up the musty stairs and press the doorbells of his home.Click. Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother who was at home helped him open the door. At the same time, there was another sound of someone opening the door from the fourth story. Section Chief Xu and his family walked down the stairs. Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother saw them and immediately greeted: \u201cSection Chief Xu, you are back so early? Are you all going to have dinner outside?\u201d Dong Xuebing also reluctantly greeted them.Section Chief Xu did not say a thing and just nodded arrogantly.Mrs. Xu laughed: \u201cTomorrow is the test. Both of us are bringing Xiao Dong to Quanjude to have dinner.\u201d\u201cOh, that place is expensive.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother said.\u201cQuanjude is still fine. It is not some fancy restaurant anyway.\u201d Xiao Dong said and glared at Dong Xuebing. He reached over to press Qu Yunxuan\u2019s doorbell. When no one opened the door, he pressed it again.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother quickly said: \u201cYunxuan might still be at work.\u201dXiao Dong disappointedly mumbled a replied and turned to his parents: \u201cMum, Dad, let\u2019s go.\u201d Dong Xuebing knew that this Xiao Dong was wooing Qu Yunxuan recently. Although Qu Yunxuan\u2019s family was not well-off, she was beautiful. This was why Section Xu\u2019s family did not object their son from going after someone a few years older.When Dong Xuebing entered his house, Section Chief Xu and his family continued their way towards the stairs. Section Chief Xu accidentally kicked the garbage bag outside of Dong Xuebing\u2019s home. Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother had placed the garbage bag there, and the bag was oily and stained with leftover foods. Section Chief Xu\u2019s shoes and pants were stained.Section Chief Xu\u2019s face changed and turned to Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why did you leave your garbage here? Did you do this on purpose?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother immediately apologized: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026 Really sorry\u2026. I\u2026.. was just about to take the garbage downstairs.\u201dXiao Dong frowned: \u201cCan you all be more cultured? You think our corridors are not dirty enough?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother replied: \u201cI will clear it now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dSeeing his mother being scolded, Dong Xuebing became furious: \u201cYou are cultured? If you are cultured, will you still throw rubbish out of your windows?\u201d The last time Dong Xuebing returned home with his mother, they were almost hit by a garbage bag thrown out of Section Chief Xu\u2019s window. It was not sure if it was Xiao Dong or Section Chief Xu who had thrown it. All the neighbors knew that Section Chief Xu\u2019s unit has been throwing their garbage bags out of their windows. But no one dares to say anything as Section Chief Xu was a government official and they were commoners.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother tugged his son\u2019s clothes: \u201cXuebing!\u201dXiao Dong stared at Dong Xuebing: \u201cWhat are you saying? Who\u2019s the one who throw rubbish out of the windows?\u201dDong Xuebing coldly replied: \u201cYou should know who it is.\u201d\u201cAre you even qualified to speak here?\u201d Section Chief Xu stared at Dong Xuebing. \u201cYou have dirtied my shoes, and you still want to argue?\u201d\u201cYou are the one\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing was about to continue arguing when his mother pulled him back.Mrs. Xu tried to calm the situation: \u201cOld Xu, why are you arguing with a kid? We are all neighbors. Let it rest.\u201d Mrs. Xu turned to Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother: \u201cXiaoping, we are off for our dinner. You should not place your garbage outside your house. This is not right. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s lungs were about to burst. That Chief Xu was the one who kicked the garbage bag, and he wants to blame his mother?Section Chief Xu used a napkin to wipe his show and turned away: \u201cFuck. Let\u2019s go. The car is waiting.\u201dXiao Dong looked at Dong Xuebing and his mother scornfully and followed his parents down the stairs.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother just smiled at them until they disappeared from her view. She quickly closes the door and sighed. \u201cXuebing, we can\u2019t afford to offend them. You\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing was still pissed: \u201cWhat sort of person is he? Government officials can be unreasonable?\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the evening, Qu Yunxuan returned from work and knocked on Dong Xuebing\u2019s door. She was carrying bags of vegetables and meat.These few days, Qu Yunxuan had integrated into Dong Xuebing\u2019s family. She had become closer with Dong Xuebing and his mother. They would have dinner together and would joke and chat. It was like a family.\u201cYunxuan, eat more.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother picked some vegetables and place in her bowl.\u201cSis Luan\u2026\u201d Qu Yunxuan hesitated for a while and asked worriedly: \u201cWhen I was on my way back, I heard from the lady downstairs said\u2026\u2026 What happened?\u201dThis apartment building was an old building built in the 1980s. The soundproofing was not very good, and neighbors could hear each other clearly. Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother tapped Qu Yunxuan\u2019s hand: \u201cYunxuan, listen to sis. If you are looking for a boyfriend, don\u2019t ever look for someone like Xiao Dong. I am not talking behind their backs, but they are all bullies\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother told her what happened just now.Qu Yunxuan frowned after she heard what happened. She held Luan Xiaoping\u2019s hand and sighed: \u201cI know that family is all not decent people. I have not told anyone else. Do you know that Xiao Dong is wooing me? But I had rejected him several times. A few days ago, I met Section Chief Xu at the supermarket on my off day. He pointed at me in the face and said. Don\u2019t think you are somebody because my son likes you. It is your honor for my son to like you\u2026\u2026. He still said many nasty things. I\u2026\u2026 Sighed\u2026.\u201dDong Xuebing clenched his fist: \u201cDoes he thinks that he is the mayor or governor?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him.\u201d Qu Yunxuan smiled sweetly and took a napkin and wiped off a grain of rice on Dong Xuebing\u2019s face. \u201cTomorrow is your test. You must do your best and not let that Xu family look down on you. Show them that not only Xiao Dong can enter the government service. Our Xiao Bing can also do it!\u201dDong Xuebing took a deep breath and replied: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will surely pass the test!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked very nervous: \u201cXiao Bing, when you answer the questions, take note of the time. If you don\u2019t know the answer, just make a random guess and move on to the next question. I heard that there will not be enough time. Oh, did you bring pencils? Remember to bring an extra pencil with you. What about erasers and 2B pencils? Did you bring your ID? You must make sure not to leave anything out.\u201d She helped Dong Xuebing to straighten his T-shirt and then wiped his shoes with a damp cloth.Dong Xuebing got a fright: \u201cStop, stop. I will wipe my shoes myself.\u201d\u201cQu Yunxuan continued to wipe his shoes carefully and gently said: \u201cThe test is at 9 am. You should take this opportunity to do some last-minute revision.\u201dQu Yunxuan was behaving like an elder sister to him.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother walked out from the kitchen with a bag. \u201cI have packed some fruits in case you are hungry or thirsty.\u201dThere was a bottle of mineral water and some ears and apples in the bag. Qu Yunxuan took the bag and said: \u201cSister Luan, I will be going to the venue later with Xiao Bing. After the morning test, I will bring him out for lunch. We will not be coming back for lunch as the venue is a bit far. He still has a second test in the afternoon.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you need to go to work today?\u201dQu Yunxuan replied: \u201cI took a day off.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take the day off from work. I can accompany him.\u201dDong Xuebing added: \u201cThat\u2019s right. You don\u2019t need to come with me.\u201d\u201cYou rascal.\u201d Qu Yunxuan playfully pinched Dong Xuebing\u2019s cheeks. \u201cYour Aunt is worried about you. Sis Luan, you should rest at home. The weather is too hot, and you have high blood pressure. You should rest more.\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother was very close with Qu Yunxuan and did not stand on ceremony: \u201cYunxuan, then I will have to trouble you. Xuebing, just do your best for the test.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dBeijing No.15 Middle School.After turning from Zi Xin Road, one could see a big red banner hung across the gate of a school \u2013 Beijing Government agencies Civil Servant Test Venue. No. 15 Middle School. There was also a notice outside stating, \u201cPlease show your ID and admission letter.\u201d and \u201cDo your best for the test.\u201d There were lots of people standing outside. Some parents were there to send their children for this test, and some wives had sent their husbands over. There was even a family of more than 10 members waiting for their child.Children were their parents\u2019 hopes. If they could become Civil Servants, their parents will be proud of them.Dong Xuebing and Qu Yunxuan stood outside the school after alighting from a Taxi.Suddenly, all eyes were on Qu Yunxuan.Qu Yunxuan was too beautiful, and wherever she goes, she would attract the stares of all the men. She was used to this, and she spoke like a mother to Dong Xuebing: \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous and just try your best. If you are able to pass, I will treat you to a big meal. Do you prefer Western or Chinese cuisine? Oh, do you still remember what I told you in the Taxi? You need to keep track of your time. The multiple-choice test is only 2 hours. You need to plan your time carefully.\u201dDong Xuebing smiled and took out his phone from his pocket: \u201cYes, I remember. I cannot bring my phone in. I will leave it with you.\u201dSuddenly, someone called Qu Yunxuan\u2019s name from their back. They turned and saw Mrs. Xu and Xiao Dong.\u201cYunxuan, you are here too? You send Xiaobing over?\u201d Unlike other parents, Mrs. Xu was calm and relax. She seems to be confident that her son will pass. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Later when Xiao Dong and Xiao Bing go in for their test, we can have tea together. It\u2019s been a while since we chatted.\u201d She turned to Dong Xuebing. \u201cDo your best.\u201d Although she said that, she never expects Dong Xuebing to pass the written test. Her son had taken this test twice. How could Dong Xuebing pass on his first try?Xiao Dong ignored Dong Xuebing and spoke to Qu Yunxuan: \u201cSis Qu, why are you here with him?\u201d He does not understand why Qu Yunxuan was so close with Dong Xuebing\u2019s family so suddenly. She was not like this in the past.Dong Xuebing was thinking in his heart. If she is not here with me, you think she will come here with you?Qu Yunxuan had a different attitude towards Xiao Bing. She nonchalantly replied something to that mother and son pair and turn to Dong Xuebing. She pushes a small cloth bag into his hand. \u201cI have gotten this from the temper, and it is supposed to bring you good luck.\u201dDong Xuebing was moved by Qu Yunxuan\u2019s concern for him. He slowly turned and walked through the school gates.The school has 3 buildings, and the test venue is on the west building.When Dong Xuebing entered the building, he noticed Xiao Dong was near him. He turned to Xiao Dong and asked: \u201cDid you really almost got the full marks in last year\u2019s national exams? You only got a few logic questions wrong?\u201d Both of them had grudges, and dong Xuebing had no reason to be nice to him.Xiao Dong looked at him with a black face and replied in an unfriendly manner: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You are jealous?\u201dDong Xuebing sneered: \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be jealous?\u201dXiao Dong: \u201cYou want to be a civil servant? Maybe in your next life. Do you want to bet to see who will enter the government agency first?\u201dDong Xuebing could feel his blood boiling: \u201cOk! We shall see!\u201dXiao Dong continued to make some snide remarks and then walk towards his room. He was well prepared for this test, especially the multiple-choice test. He was confident that he would score well and there was no way to lose to Dong Xuebing who was taking the test for his first time.Dong Xuebing did not look for his own classroom. He stood there watching Xiao Dong. When he was about 7 to 8 meters away, Dong Xuebing start to follow him. He looked at Xiao Dong\u2019s back nervously. He watches as Xiao Dong made a turn and entered a classroom along the corridor. Dong Xuebing stopped and take note of the classroom number. He walked closer and look at Xiao Dong\u2019s seat. Hmmm\u2026. middle of the 2nd row. Not far from the door.Xiao Dong saw Dong Xuebing standing outside of the room and frowned: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled: \u201cNothing. I just want to know where you are seated.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with you?\u201d Xiao Dong glared at him. \u201cBoth of us are also not in the same room. Are you thinking of copying my answers?\u201dDong Xuebing shrugged his shoulders: \u201cMaybe\u2026. Be careful with your answer sheet.\u201d\u201cYou are nuts.\u201d Xiao Dong ignored him and start to arrange his stationaries.After leaving that classroom, Dong Xuebing starts to look for his own class, Class 026. His classroom was two classes away from Xiao Dong.Dong Xuebing found his seat in his class. It was the third table by a wall.The examiner entered the class and observed every candidate in the room. He wants to make sure no one had brought cheating materials.A young man seated near the window was sweating profusely.A girl in the front row was fidgeting uneasily.A man seated at the back of the class was slapping his face with both of had hand.Dong Xuebing could feel the tension in the room. He looked around the half-filled classroom and exhaled. He calmed himself and said a silent prayer. In his heart, he was thinking: \u201cFinally this is the day.

There is a series of logic questions included in it. This test is different from IQ test and does not test the candidate\u2019s knowledge. This test can determine the potential of the candidate\u2019s abilities and suitability of being a Civil Servant. The candidate\u2019s potential is built up over the years through their experiences and education.The test was a closed book test, and there were about 135 multiple choice questions.Morning, from 9 am to 11 am. The duration of the test was 2 hours.Room 026. The examiner had read out the rules and the things to note before the start of the test. The test papers and answer sheets were given out to the candidates. Dong Xuebing touched the question booklet and prayed in his heart. Please let this test be an easy one\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing looked down at the questions and start to answer.First question. Eh? I have done a similar problem from one of the reference books. Easy.Second question. Huh? This question is also easy. It is similar to one of the questions from the Jiangnan Civil Servant test 3 years ago.Third question. After thinking for about 10 seconds, Dong Xuebing shaded C on his answer sheet. This was another easy question.Fourth question. Dong Xuebing chose B. Although he was not very confident, it should be the right answer.The first 4 questions were not difficult, and Dong Xuebing felt more confident. He thought that this test was not as difficult as he expected. He carried on answering the questions. But from the sixth question, the difficulty of the test increases. Dong Xuebing could not answer question 6 to 10. He could only guess the answers. When he reaches question 33 to 47, he was not even confident of guessing the answers.This was a dangerous sign.Dong Xuebing became more anxious as he tried answering the remaining questions.The test was too hard. It was more complicated than last year\u2019s papers.The math questions were not very difficult, as Dong Xuebing had just graduated and he could still remember what he had learned. He was able to answer almost all the calculation questions. He was confident of getting most of these questions right. Language questions should also not be a problem. He should get most of it right. But the logic and general knowledge questions were too difficult. Dong Xuebing would be jumping with joy if he could get half of his answers right. As for the questions about data analysis, he was sure that he did not get a single answer right.Shit. That\u2019s it. He had flunked the test.Dong Xuebing was cursing and swearing the person who had set these questions in his heart.20 minutes passed.40 minutes passed.There was still 15 minutes left on the clock. Many candidates had put down their pencils. Some were in a daze staring at the ceiling. Some were scratching their head, and some were looking depressed. Everyone in the room has different expressions, but one thing in common, all of them does not seems to be confident of passing.Dong Xuebing felt that he should not wait any longer. If not, he would not pass this test along with most of the candidates.He took out his 2B pencil and start to mark out the questions that he was not confident and those he does not know the answers. He counted, and there were 45 questions. As for the remaining questions, he was 70% sure that he got those correct.\u201cEh? What are you writing?\u201d The middle-aged examiner walked over to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing looked at his watch and took a deep breath. Let\u2019s start!Looking at the answer sheet with all the markings, the examiner frowned and said: \u201cYou are not supposed to write on the answer sheet. The machine will not be able to detect your answers. Hurry and erase them.\u201dDong Xuebing did not reply and suddenly stood up from his chair. The examiner and the rest of the candidates were shocked. He immediately grabbed his answer sheet and push the examiner aside. He ran as fast as he could out of the room.\u201cWTF? What is he doing?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Maybe he became crazy.\u201d\u201cStop! You are still in the middle of your test!\u201dEveryone was shocked. They could not comprehend why that person suddenly run out of the room. Was he giving up on this test?One of the examiners remained in room 026 to maintain order, and the other ran out to the corridor shouting. \u201cOld Li, Old Zhang, help me catch that man. He is still holding on to the answer sheet. Don\u2019t let him disturb the rest of the candidates.\u201dTwo examiners who were walking along the corridor were stunned. They have never encountered such a situation before.As the examiner was shouting, Dong Xuebing had entered the third classroom. He kicked the door opened. Everyone in the room was staring at him in shock. Dong Xuebing did not say a thing, and he kicked a desk in front of him aside. He ran over to Xiao Dong and snatched his answer sheet. Xiao Dong was too shocked to say a thing. He was rooted in his seat.Xiao Dong stuttered: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He could not believe what he was seeing. Never in his wildest dreams, he had expected Dong Xuebing to \u201ccopy\u201d his answers so openly.Dong Xuebing said: \u201cI had warned you to be careful with your answers before the test.\u201dThe examiners in this room were all females and were quite young. Both of them did not dare to stop Dong Xuebing after they saw him kicking open the door and snatching one candidate\u2019s answer sheet. They were rooted to the ground and shouted: \u201cWhich room are you from? What are you doing? Put the answer sheet down!\u201dWhen Xiao Dong heard the examiners shouting, he reacted. He tried to snatch his answer sheet from Dong Xuebing: \u201cGive it back to me.\u201dAlthough Dong Xuebing was not someone with good physical fitness, he was still much stronger than Xiao Dong. He dodged Xiao Dong\u2019s attempt and ran out. He jumped out of an opened window along the corridor into the garden outside and started running towards the school\u2019s empty sports field. While running, he was looking at both answer sheets in his hand. He compared his answers with Xiao Dong and memorized the answers to those questions he marked.ABBCADDDBCADAB\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing had already used up 30 seconds from the time he ran out of his room to get Xiao Dong\u2019s answers. He still has 30 seconds left.There was still enough time.\u201cStop there!\u201d\u201cStop running!\u201dA few workers and securities had caught up with him and had surrounded him.Dong Xuebing ignored them and continued to recite the answers. ABBCADDDBCADAB\u2026\u2026\u201cCatch him!\u201dDong Xuebing felt an impact on his back, and the next moment, he was pinned down on the ground.An examiner shouted from the back: \u201cWhat is he doing? Disqualified him!\u201dAnother person said while panting: \u201cCall the police!\u201dXiao Dong, who had also caught up asked: \u201cAre my results still valid? He is the one who snatched my answer sheets.\u201dDong Xuebing who was pinned under the securities, ignored his pain and gritted his teeth to finish reading the last row of answers, before shouting: \u201cBack!\u201d\u2026\u2026The surroundings were quiet.This was room 026. Everyone was doing their test, and no one was saying a word.There was only the sound of pens and pencils scratching on paper.Dong Xuebing felt some giddiness, and the next moment, he saw the balding examiner standing in front of him looking at his answer sheet. \u201cYou are not supposed to write on the answer sheet. The machine will not be able to detect your answers. Hurry and erase them.\u201dTime had returned to one minute ago.Dong Xuebing wiped his sweat with his heart still beating very fast: \u201cYes.\u201dThe Examiner looked at him and then walked away.Dong Xuebing dare not to waste any more time. He immediately picks up his pencils and starts shading the answers. I must not forget the answers. I must remember the answers\u2026\u2026ABBCADDDBCADAB\u2026\u2026Since a week ago, Dong Xuebing had started training his memory. The training was for him to cheat in the test. Dong Xuebing was shading the answers as fast as he could. The first 20 answers were easy to remember. Most people were able to temporary remember about 20 something alphabets. But it becomes harder as the number increases. Dong Xuebing tried his best, and he was able to write down slightly more than 30 answers. He knew he was unable to remember the rest of the answers and he used some tricks to help.For example, AACBA, he will remember it as AAAAA.If the answers are ABAD, he will remember it as ABCD.2 minutes later, Dong Xuebing had finished writing down all the answers he copied from Xiao Dong.If Xiao Dong really had almost scored the full marks for last year\u2019s National exams, then his scores for this year\u2019s AAT should not be too far away. There should be at least 90% of him getting the answers right. That\u2019s enough. With the rest of the answers which Dong Xuebing was confident, he should be getting a high score for this test.Phwee\u2026\u2026Cheating\u2026\u2026 Success!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Are you still confident of passing?\u201dDong Xuebing looked at him and asked: \u201cDid you screw up your test?\u201d\u201cMe? Screw up?\u201d Xiao Dong laughed and confidently replied: \u201cYou think I am the same as you? Other than 2 logic questions which I know I got it wrong, and a few general knowledge questions which I am not confident, I am confident that I got the rest of the questions right. Before I handed over my answer sheet, I calculated, and I am confident that the questions I got it wrong will not be more than 7%. Hmph! What about you? I think you should get at least 40 to 50 questions wrong.\u201dDong Xuebing smiled: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. If you are confident of passing, then I should not be a problem.\u201d\u201cStop putting on a brave front.\u201d Xiao Dong does not know what Dong Xuebing meant.After this first test, Dong Xuebing felt relieved. But when he thought of the essay test in the after, he became nervous again.Dong Xuebing had no appetite for lunch.Qu Yunxuan and Mrs. Xu, who were waiting for them, did not ask them about the test. They do not want to give them additional stress. They had a quick lunch in dumpling restaurant near the school, and soon it was time for the afternoon test.Back at No. 15 Middle School, Xiao Dong looks calm and confident. \u201cDo your best and do not fail.\u201dDong Xuebing had no confidence at all, but he still stubbornly replied: \u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d Xiao Dong went back to his classroom.The written essay test was 2 and a half hours.13:30 to 16:00.This written test was to test the candidates in 7 aspects. Reading comprehension, analytical skills, problem-solving skills, language, writing, knowledge of current political affairs, and administrative skills. There were no fixed answers and candidates had to answer in short essays.Dong Xuebing was not good at critical essays. However, he did improve slightly under Grandpa Hu\u2019s guidance over the past few days. Dong Xuebing knew that he was still not good enough to pass this test. Actually, Dong Xuebing had planned to use Back during the essay test, if the morning test was not too difficult.But his plan had failed. The morning test was too hard, and he got to use Back. Now, he had no more tricks up his sleeves.What do I do now?If the essay test is on the same standard as the morning test, Dong Xuebing knew that he will not pass.Maybe it\u2019s fated that I can\u2019t enter the government service.Half an hour before the start of the test. Room 026. Once again, Dong Xuebing could feel the tension in the air. Everyone was affected by the difficulty of the morning test, and they were frowning.Dong Xuebing sighed and tapped his cheeks. In his heart, he was praying.He was now not hoping to answer all the questions, he only pray that his scores will not be too low. He might still be able to pass with the overall marks. This was his only wish.13:30, test starts.Dong Xuebing picked up his pen and immediately start on the first question.He read the article given and then looked at the required answer. He could feel a shiver. This test was on the same difficulty as the morning test. Dong Xuebing read the article twice and does not understand what the article was about. There was no way he could answer the question.Damn.As good as dead.Dong Xuebing gritted his teeth and just answered whatever he knew, hoping to score at least some marks. He flipped the question booklet to the second question.\u201cChina has rich resources in the surrounding sea, but our Per capita income is low. Bo Sea is China\u2019s biggest inland sea. It is crucial to the economies of the Northeast region\u2026\u201dEh?! Dong Xuebing could not believe his eyes. Why was this question so familiar?He flipped over to the third question.\u201cWrite a suggestion to the head of the Tourism Bureau with regards to our China tourist misbehaving overseas. The required answer needs to be relevant and implementable. It needs to be concise and not more than 400 words\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned and gasped out loud: \u201cEh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d The examiner looked at him. \u201cDo your test quietly and don\u2019t make any noise.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked at the questions again to make sure his eyes were not playing tricks on him. He was surprised and overjoyed when he saw the fourth question. He does not know how to describe his feelings.Are these really the test questions?Are these really the test questions?Are these really the test questions?Dong Xuebing asked himself the same question thrice. He could hardly believe what he was seeing.It was half an hour into the test, and Dong Xuebing could not afford to be still in a daze. He picks up his pen again and starts to answer.Dong Xuebing was writing down his answers smoothly with no pauses in between.The examiner had been watching Dong Xuebing, and he suspects that Dong Xuebing was cheating. He walked over to Dong Xuebing and stood behind him to watch him. He glanced at Dong Xuebing\u2019s answer sheet. A minute passed, and the examiner was surprised. He stood there until the bell announcing the end of the test rang. He and the other examiner collected all the answer sheets from the candidates and sealed it in an envelope.When Dong Xuebing was about to leave the room, that examiner looked at him and nodded with a smile.Dong Xuebing was surprised and smiled back. He slowly walked out of the room. What had happened? Why were all the essay questions the same as what Grandpa Hu taught me?Complains of the candidates could be heard when they were making their way out of the school. \u201cSigh\u2026. I\u2019m dead. The questions were too difficult.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The AAT was hard enough, and the essay test was even harder. Especially the third question. How many of us can answer that?\u201d\u201cI know I had flunked this test. Sighed\u2026. Guess I have to try again next year.\u201d9 out of 10 candidates were pulling a long face.Outside of the school gate, Mrs. Xu, Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother, and Qu Yunxuan were waiting in the shade under a tree. Dong Xuebing was still in a daze. When he saw his mother and Qu Yunxuan waiting for him, he put up his hand suddenly: \u201cWait. I need to go somewhere urgently. Please go back first.\u201dBefore his mother and Qu Yunxuan could react, Dong Xuebing flagged a taxi.\u201cSir, please send me to the Cancer Hospital.\u201d Dong Xuebing told the driver.At the Oncology ward, Dong Xuebing was surprised to find Grandpa Hu\u2019s ward empty. There was no luggage, and he asked a nurse who was passing by. Grandpa Hu had discharged last night. It should be not long after Dong Xuebing left. Dong Xuebing immediately called the number in his handphone. The call got through, and a woman answered: \u201cHello, Cancer Hospital, Oncology ward.\u201dThis was not Grandpa Hu\u2019s number? He had used the hospital phone to call me that day?Dong Xuebing ran to the nurses\u2019 station to try to get Grandpa Hu\u2019s contact number and address. But the nurses there told him that they could not reveal their patient's details.Dong Xuebing stood in the corridor, staring at the empty ward.Grandpa Hu should not have many days left. Could yesterday be the last time I see him?Dong Xuebing faced the empty ward and bowed deeply 3 times.He understood why Grandpa Hu had told him that he will surely score high marks for the essay test. He realized why Grandpa Hu does not allow him to reveal what he taught to others. Maybe it was his son who had set the questions, or perhaps he knew the questions through his connections. Grandpa Hu had taught him how to answer almost 70% of the questions in the Essay test.If Dong Xuebing still could not get high marks for this test, he might as well kill himself!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He returned at about the same time as Qu Yunxuan and the others. They had taken public transport and the time taken to reach home was longer. As the taxi turned towards his residential area, Dong Xuebing saw his mother, Mrs. Xu, and the others walking in front. He immediately alights and walked over to explain himself: \u201cMum, Aunt Xuan, I\u2019m sorry. I had something urgent to do and had rushed off.\u201cXuebing\u2026\u2026\u201d His mother said his name and then stopped talking and sighed.At the hallway, Section Chief Xu who had just returned from work, walked over with a briefcase. \u201cYou finished the test?

Didn\u2019t you keep telling me that you will pass this test without any problem?\u201dXiao Dong was in despair. \u201cI also did not expect the questions to be so difficult. I don\u2019t think the other candidates are able to answer them too.\u201dSection Chief Xu continued: \u201cStop telling me that the questions are difficult. You are the one who did not work hard.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t blame Xiao Dong.\u201d Mrs. Xu helped to speak up for her son: \u201cThe questions were really too difficult. I heard many people outside the test venue complaining about it. Not only Xiao Dong, I think everyone will fail this test. Oh, Xiao Ping\u2019s son, Xiao Bing had taken the test too. He will also fail the test. At least our Xiao Dong did better than him. His multiple-choice test will get almost full marks.\u201dDong Xuebing rolled his eyes. Who\u2019s the one who told you that I will fail this test?Section Chief Xu replied angrily: \u201cIf the overall score cannot reach the minimum passing mark, he can\u2019t even qualify for the interview.\u201dMrs. Xu sighed: \u201cHe can try again next year.\u201d Section Chief Xu turned and went upstairs. Mrs. Xu looked at Xiao Dong and then turned to Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother: \u201cThe National entry exams for the Civil Servant is in a few months. Is your son going to try again?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother replied: \u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Yunxuan patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t give yourself too much pressure. You can just take the test again next year.\u201dXiao Dong had always been good with his studies. If he can\u2019t even pass the test, Dong Xuebing should not be doing well either. This was what everyone was thinking.Xiao Dong glared at Dong Xuebing and followed Section Chief Xu upstairs.Dong Xuebing knew that Qu Yunxuan and his mother thought that he did not do well for the tell. He rubbed his nose but did not try to explain.Just let them misunderstand. Even if he had passed the written test, he was also not confident of passing the interview. What if he told his mother that he had done well for the written test, and he failed the interview later? His mother might not be able to handle this roller coaster ride. She had high blood pressure, and this might affect her health. Dong Xuebing intends to tell them the truth after he had passed the interview.After dinner, Dong Xuebing returned to his room and power up his old Pentium 3 CPU. He needs to prepare himself for the interview by searching for the past few years\u2019 interview questions on the internet.5 minutes later, Dong Xuebing could not get any results from the internet. He remembered that the department he was applying did not even have its own website, let alone past year interview questions. There was not much information about the department either.The department Dong Xuebing applied was State Security.The full name of State Security was the Ministry of State Security. It is an agency under the jurisdiction of the State Council and considered a policing department. This department was a Provincial-Ministerial level department and had subsidiaries in all regions. In the provinces, the office was called the State Security Department. In the Prefecture Cities, it was called the State Security Bureau.As Beijing was the capital and a municipality directly under the Central Government, the State Security office, there was slightly different. It still reports to the Ministry of State Security and was also called State Security Bureau. But Beijing State Security Bureau was Bureau-Director level. The Branch Bureaus in the different zones of Beijing were Deputy-Bureau-Director level.The State Security department was a mysterious department. However, everyone knew what this department does. It collects intel.But Dong Xuebing heard from someone that not all people from the State Security department were mysterious. It depends on the department they were working in.For instance, the office Dong Xuebing applied for, was the State Security Bureau\u2019s Administrative Office. The people working there will have regular office hours, and they need to squeeze the morning peak hour buses. They are also allowed to attend gatherings and tell others where they are working. It was nothing confidential. One of Dong Xuebing\u2019s senior in his university was working in the State Security. He often jokes that the people who sit in the office doing administrative works like him have no chance to access to the confidential reports from the intel officers. There was nothing good about working in the State Security. They were not allowed to drink or tell others what they were doing. They cannot reveal to others where their families were staying and had many more restrictions. The only good thing was that their overtime pay was slightly higher than other departments.To be honest, it was not Dong Xuebing\u2019s choice to apply for this department.He had no other choices. There were too many restrictions imposed on the candidates when applying for the various department.For example, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Safety supervision bureau, etc. requires the candidates to not only pass the AAT and Written Essay test. The candidates need to pass one more test. Dong Xuebing was already struggling with two tests. How can he cope with one more professional test? He gave up on applying these departments without thinking.The Municipal Political Consultative Conference, Municipal commission of education and other bigger departments requires at least 2 years of working experiences.Some departments like the Red Cross and Ministry of Culture requires the candidate to be a Communist Party member.Some departments like Land and Resources Bureau requires the candidate to have at least a Master or Doctorate.Some departments require Accounting certification, height above 180 cm, female only, etc.Dong Xuebing realized that the positions he could apply were less than 3% of all the positions. Some of these positions were in rural areas where the requirements were not so strict. Even fresh graduates can apply. But there was only one vacancy. Competing with other candidates for that one vacancy would be tough. Dong Xuebing knew he will not stand a chance.When Dong Xuebing had almost given up hope, he coincidentally overheard someone from the City\u2019s State Security speaking to someone.The State Security was also recruiting, and as long as the candidate had no physical defects and did not stay overseas for a prolonged period, anyone can apply. It was not limited to male or female, a party member, work experiences, etc. The department was going to recruit 4 candidates. Compared to other departments, this was a lot.Later, Dong Xuebing found out that the State Security would usually recruit fresh grads.This was because fresh grads were not corrupted by society, complicated backgrounds and relationships. They were considered \u2018Clean.\u2019 Those people who had 2 years working experiences, will not be recruited by the State Security.This was why Dong Xuebing convinced his mother to let him apply for the position in the State Security. This was the only position with the highest possibility of hiring him.Let\u2019s hope that everything will go as planned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He experimented with this power every day to see what else he got use it for. He decided to use this power to change his current life. He wants to get out of poverty. This was the reason why he needs to be familiar with all the uses of Back.After experimenting for a few times, he found out something.The results of his experiments: First, when he was chatting with someone and said or thought of the words like \u201cBack\u201d or \u201cReturn,\u201d there will not be any effect. It was only when he consciously wanted time to return back to 1 minute ago, and he said the words \u201cBack,\u201d \u201cReturn,\u201d \u201cReverse,\u201d etc. then it will work.Second, Back might indeed be an \u201cunlimited\u201d power. When the clock struck 00:00 hrs and started a new day, he will be able to use the power without fail. But Dong Xuebing did not test if he used Back 2 seconds after midnight and returned to the previous day, 11:59 hours, will he get to use Back again when it reaches the next day.Third, Dong Xuebing was still not accustomed to the time changes from the time he uses Back and after he uses Back. It was okay if he was sitting. But if he was walking, speaking, or making some movements, when using Back, he was not able to react when the time returns. He might trip or unable to continue talking. He made a reminder to himself to be careful when using his power. He does not want to trip and fall in the middle of the road and then die from a traffic accident again.Of course, after practicing for so many days, Dong Xuebing had gotten used to using Back, and not every time he will trip.On the other hand.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother and Aunt Xuan tried to cheer him up by avoiding talking about the Civil Servant Entry Test. They tried to say some happy topics in their conversations to distract him.\u201cHaha, Xiao Bing, look at that hippo on TV. Why is it so ugly?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But the hippo is still cute\u2026. Hahaha.\u201d\u201cEh, I have never seen that type of parrots. There are so many species of birds in Africa.\u201dLooking at his mother and Aunt Xuan trying to cheer him up, Dong Xuebing could only smile. \u201cMum, Aunt Xuan, I will go and study now. You two carry on watching TV.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother looked at her son worryingly: \u201cThe National Civil Servant Exams is still far away. You should have a break. Don\u2019t tire yourself.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded.Qu Yunxuan uncrossed her leg and stroked the back of Dong Xuebing\u2019s head. \u201cYou have been hiding in your room for so many days. This is not right. Come and watch this documentary with me. It is dinner time soon. I will cook personally today. Tell me, what do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cOk, ok.\u201d Dong Xuebing replied while sneaking a peek at her cleavage from her loose top.Ring, ring, ring. Dong Xuebing\u2019s handphone rang.\u201cLet me answer this call first.\u201d Dong Xuebing looked at the caller ID, and it was an unknown number. He walked away towards the potted plants near the window and answered: \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cHi, are you Dong Xuebing?\u201d It was a sweet female voice.\u201cYes, I am. May I know who's calling?\u201d Dong Xuebing used his shoulder to hold the phone and picked up the spray bottle to wet the leaves. The water mist became water droplets on the green leaves and dripped onto the dry soil.The woman over the phone said: \u201cI am calling from the City\u2019s State Security Political Section. As our department is a bit special, we do not have a website and will not upload the results and information of the candidates. Therefore, we are notifying you about the interview over the phone. Please take down what I am going to say.\u201d The other party should be a Beijing native from her accent. The way she speaks was professional and courteous.Dong Xuebing was stunned for a while before replying: \u201cAh\u2026 Please give me a min.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother who was on the sofa looked at him: \u201cXuebing, who is calling?\u201dDong Xuebing nervously gestured to his mother and said: \u201cMum, pen, and paper.\u201dQu Yunxuan blinked and took out a pen and a supermarket brochure from the drawer under the coffee table and pass it to him. \u201cThere is no white paper. Is this ok?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Thank you.\u201d Dong Xuebing placed the supermarket brochure on the windowsill and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to keep you waiting. I got a pen and paper with me.\u201dThe woman paused for a while and said: \u201cIt\u2019s like this. You have passed your entry test, and your overall marks are the fourth among all the candidates. Please be at the Municipal personnel bureau at 09:00 am for your interview on the day after tomorrow. The address is City West Lianhuachi East Road A, No. 5, Baiyun Times Mansion Building, 22-floor room 2216\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u2026\u201dThe woman told Dong Xuebing about the things to note and reminded him to bring his ID before hanging up.Dong Xuebing was excited. He kept his phone in his pocket and turned around: \u201cMum, I will have something on in the morning the day after tomorrow. You must remember to wake me up. I cannot be late.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother asked curiously: \u201cWhere are you going? Why are you so happy?\u201dDong Xuebing laughed: \u201cI will tell you on that day. I am going into the room to do my revision.\u201dQu Yunxuan tugged Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother and pointed to the direction of the room with her chin: \u201cCould it be that Xiao Bing had found a job?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother replied. \u201cIt\u2019s good that he found a job. He can\u2019t be staying at home all the time.\u201d She said and sighed. \u201cHope he will be able to pass next year\u2019s National Exams.\u201dBack in the room.Dong Xuebing folded the brochure with the address and place it carefully into his wallet. He looked at the books and notes on interviews on the desk and said a prayer. This was the day he was waiting for. Fourth position? It was lower than he expected. Seems like many people had applied for the job at the State Security.Dong Xuebing, you must get the job!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDay of the interview.Dong Xuebing was afraid that his mother and Aunt Xuan\u2019s hopes will give him too much pressure and he was scared of disappointing them. This was why he did not tell them about his interview. He woke up early and had a bowl of porridge for breakfast, before secretly leaving for the \u201cbattlefield\u201d alone.Baiyun Times Mansion.On the 22nd floor of this building, there was a row of offices. At the door of the offices, there were signages like Earthquake Bureau, Customs, etc. After asking the directions with the receptionist, Feng Yu was directed to an office right at the end of the corridor and saw Unit 2216. There were no signages outside. There was only a piece of A4 paper \u201cWaiting Room for candidates\u201d pasted on the door.The door was open, and there was a stench of cigarette smell.Dong Xuebing looked at his watch. It was 10 minutes to 9 am. He clenched his fist and knocked lightly on the opened door.\u201cCome in.\u201d It was a man\u2019s hoarse voice.\u201cGood morning, I am Dong Xuebing. I am here for the interview.\u201d\u201cOh, show me your documents.\u201dThere were 2 men in civilian clothes sitting behind a desk. One was taller and about 45 years\u2019 old, the other was shorter, about 50 years\u2019 old. Both of them looked at Dong Xuebing\u2019s documents and waved to him to sit down. There was an empty chair in front of them. Dong Xuebing sat upright. He was nervous, and his heart was beating very fast.After waiting for a while, a middle age woman walked in from outside and sat behind the desk. She was much shorter than the taller man.\u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d The taller man took out a stack of documents. \u201cCan we start?\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201c\u2026\u2026 yes.\u201dDong Xuebing was perturbed. He had thought that with his results from the AAT and the written test, he should be one of the top 3 candidates. But the woman from State Security who called him told him that he was fourth place. That means he was the fourth person that was interviewed. If he could not answer the interviewers\u2019 questions, he might even lose his position to the 5th and 6th candidates.The State Security was only recruiting 4 people in this recruitment exercise.The 3 interviewers looked at each other, and the taller man said in a stern voice: \u201cWhat do you think of this year\u2019s stock market?\u201dHere it comes.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mind was working as fast as he could. He had traded shares before when his family still had money. He knows a bit about the stock market. He also watched the news regularly and had keep track of the financial markets. Dong Xuebing could answer this question in many ways. But when he was about to open his mouth, he remembered Grandpa Hu\u2019s reminder. He had told Dong Xuebing that behind every question, there was a hidden meaning.Close. Dong Xuebing nearly told the interviewers about his analysis of the stock market.The interviewers asked this question was not to know if Dong Xuebing play shares. They should be looking for other answers.Dong Xuebing reorganized his words in his mind and said: \u201cThe earlier part of the year, all the major markets were doing well. I think this is a good thing, but also a bad thing. From the perspective of economics\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing starts to talk about how the global economic situation can affect China\u2019s economy. This was what he learned over the past two weeks. Although it was not very impressive, it was better than repeating what was reported in the papers. At least he did not say anything wrong.Dong Xuebing just wanted to be saved and secure his 4th position. This way, he would still be able to be a civil servant.\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s my thoughts about the stock market.\u201d After 2 minutes, Dong Xuebing stop.The taller man looked at him: \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned: \u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s all.\u201d What does he mean? I did not answer his question correctly?The taller man did not say anything. The 3 interviewers start to write something. It should be their comments and ratings of Dong Xuebing. After a while, the shorter man asked: \u201cIf you are now working with the government and your men on the ground often make a lot of suggestions over the internet. What will you do?\u201dDong Xuebing thought for a few seconds. He remembered the standard replies he memorized a few days ago. Those replies were to answer these types of hypothetic questions. He felt that it can be used to answer this question. He immediately rephrases the replies he memorized in his mind and responded: \u201cCurrently, the internet has become a channel for people to voice their thoughts and sentiments. This is an important channel for the government. When the subsidiary units use the internet to make suggestions to the higher-ups, they will also reflect the issues they are facing on the ground. As the higher-ups, it will be easier for us to understand what they are going through and find ways to deal with the problems\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing speaks for about 2 minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s my answer to your question.\u201dThe taller man fanned himself with the stack of papers in front of him: \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201dStill not enough?Dong Xuebing thought for a while and said a bit more from the various answers he memorized: \u201cIf the subsidiary units made suggestions about our working attitudes and operating models, I would consolidate all heir suggestions and all for a department meeting. We should look into improving our work attitudes and operations. As a service provider, we should constantly refine and improve the ways we do things\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing continued for another 2 more minutes.The woman and the shorter man were writing something.The taller man asked with the same tone: \u201cIs there any more things you want to add?\u201dThe woman frowned and looked at the taller man without saying a word.The shorter man was tapping the desk with his pen. He kept looking down on the document in front of him and seldom raise his head.\u201cErmmm\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s all.\u201d Dong Xuebing was frustrated.Dong Xuebing continued to answer the next few questions. He felt that he had responded to the questions well. But that taller man does not seem satisfied with him. He kept asking \u201cThat\u2019s all? Finished? Nothing else? What about the rest?\u201d after Dong Xuebing\u2019s replies. He made it sounds like Dong Xuebing had given a very bad answer. He will indirectly influence the other two interviewers.Damn, who did I offend? Why was this person making things so difficult for me?Were all Civil Servant interviews like this? Cannot be. Dong Xuebing had never heard of such interviewers.Dong Xuebing\u2019s heart sank. He knew that he will not pass this interview. He could tell from the taller interviewer that he was trying to make things difficult for him.Damn.He will not pass the interview\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySwish, swish, swish\u2026\u2026The pages of the document were flipped over slowly. All the interview questions were asked.Dong Xuebing was feeling frustrated, but he could not blow up. He could only bear with it.The taller interviewer tapped on the document in front of him with his fingers and not saying a word. This interviewer had indeed wanted Dong Xuebing to score poorly for this interview. On the second day after the written test results were released, he had received a call from a leader. That leader had told him the name of a young man who will be going for the interview. Although the leader did not say anything, the taller interviewer knew that the young man was this leader\u2019s nephew. The leader was hinting to him to let his nephew pass the interview and get the position.The tall interviewer checked the results, and the young man\u2019s results were 5th. He needs to get rid of one person in the top 4.The first 3 people had handled the interview very well. So, this interviewer decided to fail the 4th position candidate, Dong Xuebing. This person did not have any background and was from an average family. Dong Xuebing\u2019s results were only slightly higher than the 5th place. If he suppresses Dong Xuebing\u2019s interview results, Dong Xuebing will drop to the 6th or 7th place. This was why he was trying to make things difficult for Dong Xuebing. The other interviewers knew what he was trying to do.But here\u2019s the problem.Although Dong Xuebing\u2019s answers were not fantastic, he did not make any mistakes. If the tall interviewer gave Dong Xuebing a low score for no reasons, he might get into trouble if he was found out. He decided to focus on the last interview question. Based on the interview procedures, the last question of the interview was up to the interviewer. The interviewer can ask anything.Dong Xuebing does not know that the moment he steps foot into this interview room, he was destined to fail.\u201cUh, this is the last question\u2026\u2026\u201d The taller interviewer was thinking hard about what question to ask.Just when Dong Xuebing was preparing to listen to the final question, a group of people walked past the interview room.A younger woman was laughing and saying: \u201cIf you want to buy a phone, you should buy an iPhone. It is the trendiest phone.\u201dA slightly older man replied: \u201cI am still used to Nokia phones.\u201d\u201cWe should support our country\u2019s domestic products.\u201d Another man in his 30s said.Their voices were quite loud. Dong Xuebing and the 3 interviewers looked at them. When those people walked further away, the taller interviewer who was closest to the door, stood up and close the door. He returned to back to his seat behind the desk and asked: \u201cThis is the last question of this interview. What are the colors and brand of those people\u2019s clothes and shoes, who walked past just now?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Dong Xuebing thought he had heard wrong. \u201cCan you please repeat your question?\u201dThe taller man repeated his question impatiently: \u201cWhat are the colors and brand of those people\u2019s clothes and shoes, who walked past just now?\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned. All his focus was on the interviewers in front of him. He did not notice those people who walked past.The taller interviewer looked at him: \u201cYou can\u2019t even tell me the color of one person\u2019s clothes and shoes?\u201dThe female interviewer\u2019s face changed. She wanted to say something, but she paused and shook her head.WTF was this question? How can one remember those people\u2019s clothes and shoes without preparation? This was an interview and who would dare to be distracted to notice those people? This was too much. Dong Xuebing could not stand it any longer and asked: \u201cSorry, I do not understand what has their clothes and shoe color got to do with my interview.\u201dThe taller interviewer looked at him emotionlessly: \u201cWe take a lot of factors into consideration during the interview. For example, your observations, memories, focus, etc. Can\u2019t you answer me?\u201d Seeing Dong Xuebing\u2019s pale face, the tall interviewer wrote something on his document and said: \u201cThat\u2019s all. You can go back and wait for our call.\u201dThat\u2019s it?I can\u2019t get this position?Fuck! Dong Xuebing was mad. Fine, you want to test my observations, memories, focus skills?Back!\u2026\u2026The scene changes.Dong Xuebing could hear the footsteps, \u201c\u2026\u2026buy an iPhone. It is the trendiest phone.\u201dA slightly older man replied: \u201cI am still used to Nokia phones.\u201d\u201cWe should support our country\u2019s domestic products.\u201d Another man in his 30s said.A younger woman was laughing and saying: \u201cIf you want to buy a phone, you should buy an iPhone. This is the trendiest phone.\u201d\u201cI am still used to Nokia phones.\u201d\u201cWe should support our country\u2019s domestic products.\u201dThe two men and that woman walked past the office again. Dong Xuebing immediately stared at them.The taller interviewer closed the door and returned to his seat: \u201cThis is the last question of this interview. What are the colors and brand of those people\u2019s clothes and shoes, who walked past just now?\u201d The interviewer was confident that Dong Xuebing was unable to answer him. Even he who tried to remember what those people were wearing, he could not see their shoes properly. Let alone the brand of their shoes. No one should be able to know.The female interviewer could not stand it. What sort of interview question was this? However, because of the leader notifying them about his nephew in advanced, she kept quiet and did not stop the tall interviewer.Dong Xuebing closed his eyes and did not say a word.The tall interviewer looked at him: \u201cYou can\u2019t answer me? Ok. This interview is over. You can go back and wait for our call.\u201d He finished saying and was about to write down the results of the interview.Dong Xuebing slowly opened his eyes and said with his eyes half-open: \u201cThat girl is wearing a cotton material top, orange in color and a white pleated skirt. She is wearing a pair of grey and white open toe heels. There is a purple colored flower print design on the heels.\u201d The 3 interviewers were shocked. Dong Xuebing continued: \u201cThat man in his 30s is wearing a brown and white strip T-shirt. He is also wearing a gold necklace. His pants are black in colored, and his shoes are a pair of black pointed toes leather shoes. At the pointed part if the shoes, there was some dust.\u201dThe taller interviewer dropped his pen on the desk, and the pen rolled to the edge and dropped onto the floor.Dong Xuebing took a deep breath and continued: \u201cThe last man was wearing a casual shirt with embroidery patterns. The shirt is black in color, and the embroidery pattern is a dragon. The embroidery pattern has many colors, but it is mainly gold and white. His pants are a pair of grey jeans. The material is a softer material, and his shoes are of canvas material. The top part of the shoes is brownish yellow in color, and the bottom part is greyish white. The shoelaces on both feet are of a different color. The left foot is red in color, and the right is green.\u201d Dong Xuebing had practiced his memories to cheat in the written test. He was able to remember things quickly. He looked up at the interviewers: \u201cErmmmm\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s all.\u201dThe taller interviewer immediately ran out of the room.3 minutes later, he walked back into the office. The other two interviewers looked at him, and he nodded listlessly.They took in a deep breath to calm themselves.The taller interviewer looked at Dong Xuebing as if he was a monster. \u201cErmmm\u2026 Very good. You\u2026 erm\u2026.. you go back and wait for our notification.\u201dDong Xuebing stood up and bowed to the interviewers. \u201cThank you for the interview.\u201dAfter Dong Xuebing left, the taller interviewer lit a cigarette. \u201cIncredible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The shorter man said. \u201cI have never met anyone like him. How did he remember all those details?\u201d\u201cI also want to know how.\u201d The female interviewer said. \u201cHe did not know what you are going to ask beforehand and had just glanced at those people. How come he can even remember the color of the shoelaces and the dust at the tip of the shoes? This cannot be described as having good observation skills and memory. This was too unbelievable.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Morning.Qu Yunxuan\u2019s apartment living room.Dong Xuebing and his mother had wanted to ask Aunt Xuan along to buy groceries in the southern part of the city. The meat and vegetables there were cheaper. But when they entered her apartment, they saw Xiao Dong and his mother, Mrs. Xu, sitting in the living room chatting with Aunt Xuan. Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother pulled a chair over and join in their conversations. The Dong and Xu families were not on good terms, especially Dong Xuebing and Xiao Dong. But Beijing people had lots of pride and tried to be nice to each other. Even when they dislike each other, they will still chat for a while whenever they met.\u201cXiao Ping, I heard that your son Xiao Bing had been revising these few days.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The National Civil Servant exams are in 6 months. What about your Xiao Dong?\u201d\u201cHe is also doing his revision. If the questions are not too difficult, he should be able to pass.\u201d\u201cSighed\u2026 You do not need to worry about your son, unlike me. My Xuebing had never been good with his studies since young.\u201dDong Xuebing sat there quietly drinking a glass of coke given to him by Aunt Xuan. He did not take part in their conversations. He knew that his chances of passing the interview were slim. The main interviewer had something against him, and most likely he will fail the interview. Dong Xuebing had been feeling down and had been quiet the past two days.\u201cDrink slowly.\u201d Qu Yunxuan took a tissue paper and helped Dong Xuebing\u2019s mouth. What are you thinking?\u201dXiao Dong saw the way Qu Yunxuan wipe Dong Xuebing\u2019s mouth. He glared at Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing smiled: \u201cI am thinking about the exams.\u201dQu Yunxuan sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t give yourself too much pressure. I am worried about you.\u201dMrs. Xu said with an air of superiority: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I had said previously. The chances of fresh graduates passing the Civil Servant test is too low. You should get a job and have a few years of working experiences first. After 2 to 3 years, you can try again for the national exams. Treat this few years as training. One of my colleague\u2019s kid had taken the National Exams for a few years after he graduated but had not passed. He had wasted his time.\u201dQu Yunxuan does not like the way she speaks. \u201cYou can\u2019t be so sure.\u201dMrs. Xu nodded. \u201cIf you are lucky, you might pass the written test after a few tries.\u201dQu Yunxuan rubbed Dong Xuebing\u2019s head and said: \u201cOur Xiao Bing is very smart. He should be able to pass the next National Exams.\u201dXiao Dong took his eyes away from Qu Yunxuan and looked at Dong Xuebing. After one month, he had regained his confidence. \u201cMy written test results are out. I got 85 marks for the administrative aptitude test. I heard that very few candidates got more than 90 marks for this year. How much did you get?\u201d 85 marks for AAT? That means Xiao Dong did not score any marks for the essay test. If not, he would have met the minimum required marks of 100 to qualify for the Custom\u2019s interview.Dong Xuebing replied without even looking at him. \u201cI forgot.\u201dXiao Dong sneered. \u201cYour results are not good? Do you need me to give you some tuitions?\u201d\u201cNo need. I can do my own revisions.\u201d Dong Xuebing was not interested.Maybe it was because Qu Yunxuan was around and Xiao Dong tried to leave a good impression: \u201cOk. You can always ask me if you have difficulties answering any questions.\u201dMrs. Xu smiled happily and patted Xiao Dong on his back: \u201cMy son is very good in administrative aptitude test. I asked all the neighbors around here who\u2019s kids had taken part in this test. None of them had scored more than 80 marks. The best was only 65 marks. But my Xiao Dong had not done very well for his essay questions. At least he was better than a lot of people. Many of them did not even get 15 marks.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother sighed: \u201cYour son will definitely be as successful as Section Chief Xu in the future.\u201dMrs. Xu laughed proudly: \u201cWho knows what will happen in the future?\u201dRingringring\u2026\u2026 Dong Xuebing\u2019s phone rang. He took it out from his pocket and answered: \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cHi, are you Dong Xuebing?\u201d It was a man\u2019s voice. From his voice, Dong Xuebing could not tell his age. He might be in his 40s, 50s and even 60s.\u201cI am. May I know who\u2019s calling?\u201d\u201cI am calling from West District\u2019s State Security Branch Bureau, Political Section. The City Bureau had sent the results of your application in the morning. I am calling to notify you. You are required to report to West District\u2019s State Security Branch Bureau on next Monday, 9 am. You can take down the address. Western district, Zixin Road East, south of the 50 meters mark. You will see a building with no signages. Because we are a special unit, we will not be issuing any written notification to you. You only need to bring your identification card, Household Register, the original and a photocopy of your school\u2019s certificate.\u201dDong Xuebing was in a daze. \u201cAh? You are saying\u2026\u2026 saying\u2026\u2026\u201dThe man on the phone said in a firm tone: \u201cYou have passed the Civil Servant test and interview. We are short on manpower. This is why we need you to report earlier than other departments. If you have any other reason that prevents you from reporting latest by next Friday, we might cancel your application. Do take note.\u201dDong Xuebing anxiously said: \u201cNo, no. I have no problems. I will surely be there on Monday.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d The sound of paper rustling could be heard over the phone. \u201cThe section you are being posted to is General Office. You will know the detail when you report on Monday.\u201d State Security was different from other government agencies. Applicants for the other agencies could write down the specific section or departments on the application form. But for State Security, the applicants can only write \u201cAdministrative Department\u201d or other general terms. It was up to the office to assign the applicant.\u201cYes. Yes. Thank you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Too, too, too\u2026\u2026 The line was cut.Dong Xuebing kept his phone and return to his seat. His hand was shaking.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother looked at him concernedly: \u201cDid you find a job? What company is it? How is the benefit?\u201dMrs. Xu said: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Get a job outside while trying for the test or exams again. I am being frank with you. Even if you are not able to pass, at least you can still support yourself.\u201dXiao Dong looked at Dong Xuebing arrogantly: \u201cIs your salary more than 2,000 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing can\u2019t be bothered with him. He turned to face his mother. \u201cMum, I need to tell you something.\u201dHis mother looked at him: \u201cWhat?\u201dDong Xuebing cleared his throat. \u201cErmmm\u2026. I passed the test, and I am a Civil Servant now.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother almost choked on her tea. She coughed and put down the teacup. \u201cWhat did you say? What did you pass?\u201d\u201cI said I passed the Civil Servant test and I am a Civil Servant now.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother stared at him. \u201cDo you think it is funny to trick me?\u201dQu Yunxuan and pinched Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm. \u201cYou are not even call up for the interview, how can you be a Civil Servant? Since when did you become so humorous? It\u2019s fine. You can retake the test. Just work harder and stop thinking about the past test. Cheer up.\u201dDong Xuebing raised his voice. \u201cMum, Aunt Xuan, since when did I lie to you all? I really pass the test, and they have already notified me over the phone.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother, Aunt Xuan, Mrs. Xu, and Xiao Dong were all stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tell me.\u201dQu Yunxuan also asked: \u201cYou pass the test? But didn\u2019t you did badly for your administrative aptitude and essay tests?\u201d\u201cErmmmm. I did not do badly for the test. You all are the ones who misunderstood me and all of you had never asked me about the test.\u201d Dong Xuebing laughed embarrassedly. \u201cLater, I felt that I still have to pass the interview and I am not confident. That\u2019s why I did not tell you. I don\u2019t want to give you false hopes. Errr\u2026\u2026 Do you still remember I had gone out in the morning of the day before yesterday? I had gone for the interview that morning. During the interview, I felt my replies were not good, and I was in the 4th place. I thought I had failed the interview. But they had just called me, asking me to report to the Western District Branch Bureau next Monday. They told me that I am hired.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother grabbed his hand. Her lips were trembling: \u201cYou really pass? You are not lying to me?\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cHahaha. I don\u2019t dare to lie to you.\u201dMrs. Xu stuttering asked: \u201cIs this a mistake? What is your score for the written test?\u201dDong Xuebing looked at the mother and son. \u201cMy overall score for the test is about 130.\u201d\u201c130?\u201d Xiao Dong grasped. \u201cYou really scored 130 for your overall score?\u201d\u201cMy clever boy\u2026\u2026 my clever boy\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother started to cry. Her tears were flowing. She was holding on to Qu Yunxuan\u2019s hand and was lost for words. \u201cYunxuan, did you hear it? Xuebing had passed. My son is now a Civil Servant.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I heard it.\u201d Qu Yunxuan helped to wipe her tears. \u201cThis is a good thing. Stop crying.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother could not stop her tears from flowing down. \u201cI am too happy. Really very happy.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed and playfully knocked Dong Xuebing\u2019s head: \u201cYou this rascal had done us proud.\u201dDong Xuebing was feeling very emotional too.After a while, Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother finally stopped her tears. She wiped her face and immediately said: \u201cYunxuan, don\u2019t cook lunch today. Come over to my place for lunch. I will go downstairs to buy more vegetables and meat. I will prepare a feast.\u201d She turned to Mrs. Xu and Xiao Dong. \u201cYou and Xiao Dong don\u2019t leave too. Come over to my place for lunch.\u201dMrs. Xu slowly forced a smile: \u201cNo thanks. I\u2026\u2026 I still have something on in the afternoon.\u201dXiao Dong gritted his teeth: \u201cMum, let\u2019s go.\u201dQu Yunxuan asked politely: \u201cWhy not stay a while longer?\u201d\u201cWe still have something on later. You all can carry on.\u201dMrs. Xu dragged Xiao Dong out. Before leaving, Xiao Dong looked at Dong Xuebing jealously. He can no longer be arrogant and proud. Dong Xuebing becoming a Civil Servant was a massive blow to this mother and son pair.About 10 minutes after they left, there was the sound of things being thrown about from upstairs. Shouts could also be heard.\u201cStop hitting our son.\u201d It was Mrs. Xu\u2019s voice. \u201cStop hitting.\u201d\u201cDad\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEven that kid from the Dong Family is better than you! I will break your legs today!\u201d It was Section Chief Xu\u2019s voice.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026\u2026.\u201dDong Xuebing felt good hearing Xiao Dong screaming in pain.During lunch, the overjoyed Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother drank two bottles of beer. \u201cXuebing, you have made me proud. Mum had never been so happy my whole life. Help me top up my glass. I will finish this bottle today.\u201dDong Xuebing was also feeling proud and helped his mother, and Aunt Xuan poured beer.Qu Yunxuan reminded: \u201cDon\u2019t let Sister Luan drink so much. She will get drunk.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother was smiling and raised her glass. \u201cYunxuan, let me toast you. These few days, you had helped Xuebing a lot. If it were not for you helping him to cook and wash his clothes, he would not have so much time to study.\u201dDong Xuebing heard this and quickly raise his glass too. \u201cAunt Xuan, thank you.\u201dQu Yunxuan waved her hand and said: \u201cSister Luan, Xiao Bing, don\u2019t say that. Xiao Bing had saved my life. Let\u2019s not thank each other. I am younger than you, so I should be the one toasting you. Cheers.\u201dEvening.Qu Yunxuan returned home, and Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother was humming an eighties song while packing her luggage.Dong Xuebing can\u2019t bear to see his mum leaving: \u201cWhy do you have to leave so early? Can\u2019t you stay for a few more days?\u201d\u201cThe village is starting school soon. I had wanted to return a few days ago, but I saw you were down. That\u2019s why I stayed to accompany you.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother smiled. \u201cNow, you have entered the government service, and I have no more worries. It\u2019s time I go back to the village.\u201d Beihe Province was not far from Beijing and was only a 3 hours car ride away.Dong Xuebing helped his mother packed two middle school Chinese Language teaching materials. \u201cLet me send you off tomorrow. You must remember to take care of yourself.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. You must be careful when working in a government agency. It is the most competitive place in China. Our family has no background, and it will not be easy for a commoner to be promoted. It\u2019s fine if you remain as a low-level staff and not be promoted. I just want you to be safe.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded listlessly. \u201cI know.\u201dIf it were 2 months ago, Dong Xuebing would be contented if he could find a 2,000 RMB a month job and an average woman as his wife. He and his wife will take a loan to buy an apartment and live happily ever after. He had never imagined his life will change so much. He was now a civil servant.Since getting the special power, things had been going smoothly for him in the right direction.Be an officer? It does not seem to be an unrealistic goal.What\u2019s the road ahead?What\u2019s my next step?At night, Dong Xuebing was deep in thoughts while lying on the couch. Since he was able to enter the government service and have the special power \u2018Back,\u2019 he felt he should plan his life. If he were still an average person, he would be satisfied to be promoted to a Deputy Divisional Chief after working there for 10 to 20 years. But now, Dong Xuebing can turn back time. He should be able to use this ability to get power and wealth.Set the goal as Section Chief? A village mayor? A County Mayor? Or a Provincial Bureau head?Getting the rank of a Section Chief before retirement at 60 years\u2019 old? Huh? Is this goal set too low?Then how about Divisional Chief? Will it be too high? Dong Xuebing was not even confident of reaching the rank of a Deputy Section Chief. Divisional Chief was too far away.But\u2026\u2026After a while, Dong Xuebing slapped his lap. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201dDong Xuebing decided to set his goal \u201chigher.\u201d Of course, if it was possible, he also wanted to be promoted from a Staff Member to a Section Head level, from a Section Chief level to a Divisional Chief level, from a Divisional Chief level to a Bureau Director level, from a Bureau Director level to Provincial Ministerial level and from Provincial Ministerial level to National Level\u2026\u2026 Yes. This will be my goal.Dong Xuebing wants to enter the Central Committee.He wants to enter the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC!Dong Xuebing had set this unrealistic goal as his target in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMonday.Morning, at 8 am.Dong Xuebing was walking towards Western District State Security Branch Bureau. He was still thinking about the ridiculous goal he set for himself two days ago. But when he remembers that he had not even reported for work and he was already dreaming of becoming a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, he blushed. If his mother or his classmates knew about his dreams, they would surely laugh at him. But Dong Xuebing will not give up so easily. He will work hard to achieve this goal.Western District, Zhixin Road.West side of a cross junction.Looking at the time, it was only 8.20 am. There was still time before 9 am. Dong Xuebing walked over to a roadside stall and bought an egg crepe for breakfast. He ate the crepe behind a pirated book store. He was familiar with this area. The venue for his written test, No. 15 Middle School, was just ahead. Just across the walkways was the South entrance to Jiangong Hospital. Further east was the northern entrance of Tao Ran Ting gardens.Just after Dong Xuebing finishes his crepe, he saw a bus entering a bus stop in front of him.A man alighted from the bus. All the passers-by turned to look at him. He was a young man about 1.9m in height and about 150 Kg in weight. He should be about Dong Xuebing\u2019s age and had a fierce look. All the other office workers at the bus stop thought he was a hooligan and stepped away from him.After alighting from the bus, the tall and fat man looked around and walked towards Dong Xuebing.When Dong Xuebing thought that he was going to be beaten up by this big size hooligan, that big size man squats down on a step 1 m away from him. He reached out his hand and patted a dirty stray cat sleeping on the steps. He stroked the cat, and the cat was meowing and licking that man\u2019s hand.\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d That man asked the cat gently. \u201cWhat do you want to eat? I will go and buy now.\u201dThe cat was meowing and playfully scratching that man with its claws.That big size man played with the cat for a while before walking over to a roadside stall to buy a sausage and start feeding the cat. \u201cEat slowly. Don\u2019t choke.\u201d His actions were a stark contrast to his outer appearances. Dong Xuebing was still not accustomed to this, but he felt that this was a caring person.It was finally 8.50 am.Dong Xuebing walked past that big size man and made a turn around the corner. He walked towards a rusty gate. He could see 2 old buildings which were built in the 70s or 80s in the compound. The metal gates were closed, and there was only an opened window by the side of a small guardroom. A few people were pushing their bicycles slowly through the gate. Dong Xuebing felt he was in the wrong place. He thought this was an office building and the condition of this place was too poor. There were even no guards outside. This was more like a state-owned factory, rather than a State Security branch.There were no signages at the entrance.Dong Xuebing looked around and then tried to follow a middle age man, who was pushing his bicycle, through the gates.\u201cEh! You. Wait!\u201d An old man\u2019s head sticks out of that open window of the guardroom. \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201dDong Xuebing immediately replied: \u201cIs this the Western District State Security Branch Bureau? I have just passed my Civil Servant test this year, and the Political Section office had called me to report today at 9 am. My name is Dong Xuebing.\u201dThe old man nodded and picked up the landline phone to make a call. After a few seconds, that old man hung up the phone and nodded to Dong Xuebing. He hands over a registration book to him. \u201cSign this, and you can enter. The Political Section office is at the southeast building. That grey colored building. It is on the second floor, right at the end of the corridor. You proceed there straight. Don\u2019t wander around.\u201d\u201cOk. Thank you.\u201dThe mood in the compound was very different from other government agencies. Beijing people were very hospitable and will greet and chat for a while when they see someone they know. They will talk about some meaningless stuff, like \u201cHave you eaten breakfast?\u201d \u201chow\u2019s your flu?\u201d \u201cAre your kids in school?\u201d Etc. But in this compound, the people only nodded to each other and did not speak. Only when they saw a leader, they will open their mouths and greet them \u201cGood morning, Section Chief.\u201d Or \u201cGood morning, Director.\u201d There was no pointless chatting.Grey building.Second floor\u2019s corridor.Dong Xuebing saw the sign \u201cPolitical Section office\u201d on the wall. But there were lots of offices there, and he does not know which office to enter. When he was hesitating, he heard footsteps behind him. He turns around. Huh? It was that big size man he met at the bus stop. Was he also from the State Security?\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Dong Xuebing asked. \u201cThis is my first day. Do you know which office should I go?\u201dThat big size man paused and scratched his head embarrassedly. \u201cI am also here to report, and I am also looking for the office.\u201d\u201cHuh? What a coincidence.\u201d Both kept quiet. Dong Xuebing could feel this person was not good at talking like him. He cleared his throat and said: \u201cErrrmmm\u2026\u2026 My name is Dong Xuebing.\u201dThat big size man smiled: \u201cI am Sun Zhuang. I have just graduated from University. My friends in school call me Zhuang Zhi (means pillar in Chinese).\u201dBoth shook hands and walked into an office nearest to them. They entered the correct office. A staff member in civilian clothes told them to wait there. A Deputy Chief from the Political Section office entered the room and go through all the paperwork and told them the rules and regulations within the department.More than an hour past.The Deputy Chief took a sip of tea: \u201cThat\u2019s all. The both of you will be posted to the General Affairs Department. I heard that the department is short on manpower. Try to familiarize yourselves with this place. Tomorrow will be your official first day. As for your uniforms, we will give it to you when it is ready. Anyway, other than some meetings in the City Bureau, we do not need to wear the State Security uniforms. This is not important.\u201dAfter finishing what he had to say, he asked the staff member to show Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi where their office was.The General Affairs Department was located on the ground floor. It was a partitioned small office. There were 8 to 9 desks in it.That staff member from the Political Section office walked in and said: \u201cWe have newcomers. Both are fresh graduates. This is Dong Xuebing, and this is Sun Zhuang.\u201dDong Xuebing knew the first impression was essential and he modestly said: \u201cI am new here and do not know anything. Please guide me along in the future. Thank you.\u201dZhuang Zi heard Dong Xuebing, and he quickly said: \u201cMe too. Please guide us along.\u201dThe people in the office look at both of them from head to toe.One girl in the office laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Once you enter this office, we are one big family.\u201dThat staff member from the Political Section office pointed to the 5-6 people in the office. \u201cChief Zhou had gone to the doctor? He does not seem to be around. This lady is Tan Limei, that is Old Yan, Guo Panwei, Guo Shunjie, Changjuan\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His desk was by a window in a corner. Sun shone brightly on his desk through the window\u2019s panels. It was warm and bright. Pulling the curtains had helped a bit. Directly opposite of Dong Xuebing was Zhuang Zhi\u2019s desk. They were facing each other. In the middle, there were 2 17in monitors and a table calendar separating them.In the office, other than Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi, the rest of the staffs were very busy.A cheerful girl standing at the photocopier machine was organizing some documents. She said without raising her head: \u201cGuo Shunfa, I have too many things to do. Help me photocopy some documents. The Bureau needs them urgently.\u201dGuo Shunfa, in his late 20s, was busily typing on his keyboard: \u201cI am also very busy. Ask someone else to help you.\u201dThe oldest staff in the office, Old Yan was sitting at his desk reading the newspapers. He does not have any intention to offer his help.Guo Panwei, who looks like a monkey, was looking down, writing something. He shouted: \u201cLet me finish writing this and I will be there.\u201dThe woman, named Changjuan, was holding up a small mirror drawing her eyebrows.Dong Xuebing looked around and walked over. \u201cSister Tan, let me help.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Tan Limei passed a stack of documents to Dong Xuebing and said: \u201cYou know how to photocopy? Place the documents here along this line and press that big button. Remember its single side and I need 4 sets. Staple them when it's ready. Oh, what did you call me just now? Sister Tan? Haha\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t call me that. I attended school early and had only just graduated one year ago. I might even be younger than you and Zhuang Zhi.\u201d\u201cI will also help.\u201d Zhuang Zhi walked over.Tan Limei casually said: \u201cFine. One of you photocopy and the other staple. Better be quick. The Leader is waiting.\u201dWhile waiting for the copier to print the documents, Zhuang Zhi clumsily stapled the stacks of papers.When Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi finished with the documents, Guo Panwei, who had been looking down, and Changjuan who was drawing her eyebrows, stood up and said at the same time: \u201cI will send the documents over.\u201d Both looked at each other, and Changjuan smiled seductively: \u201cI will send the documents to the Political Section and the Confidential Department. You can send the documents to the Bureau Chief.\u201d They arranged the documents and Guo Panwei straighten his shirt, while Changjuan touched up her makeup. After that, both of them walked out of the office with the papers at the same time.Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi were puzzled.Tan Limei was used to this and grumbled behind their back: \u201cLazing around at work all the time and only rushed forward when there is a chance to meet the leaders. Hmph!\u201dDong Xuebing was new and does not know the characters of the people in the office. He smiled and did not say anything.Suddenly Guo Shunjie waved: \u201cXiao Dong, Xiao Sun, come over here.\u201dDong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi walked over: \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCreate one more copy for these tables. Do you know Excel? Just use the same format and recreate a table. The data you can get from this Word document. Copy and paste will do. Don\u2019t paste into the wrong table. I need this file before noon. Once completed, print it out.\u201d Guo Shunjie spoke like a leader, and his instructions were clear. When Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi were creating the table, he was free and was drinking tea and surfing net. He was reading some aquarium fish forum.Noon.Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi completed their task. Guo Shunjie looked at the printout and nodded. \u201cHmmm\u2026 Good.\u201dTan Limei joked: \u201cLeader Guo, it is lunchtime now. Can we go for lunch?\u201dGuo Shunjie did not get angry and laughed: \u201cI am not a leader yet. Stop poking fun at me.\u201dGuo Panwei looked at his watch and took his clutch bag: \u201cI will be going to the hospital to visit Chief Zhou.\u201d He left.Changjuan also stood up: \u201cI will not be eating at the cafeteria. Someone is treating me for lunch.\u201d\u201cXiao Dong, Xiao Sun.\u201d Old Yan, who did not speak a single word the whole morning, smiled to them both: \u201cYou still have not bought the lunch tickets? Come, let\u2019s go. Both of you can use my tickets first.\u201dDong Xuebing hurriedly waved his hand. \u201cNo need, no need. Thank you. Both of us can eat outside.\u201dZhuang Zhi also said: \u201cYes, yes. Thank you.\u201dTan Limei said: \u201cThere is nothing good to eat outside. Don\u2019t think our cafeteria here is small. The food is delicious. Come, let\u2019s go. Old Yan, I will bring them to the cafeteria, and they will use my lunch tickets.\u201dOld Yan smiled at her: \u201cFine. You, youngsters, should get together more. These two young men seem quite hardworking.\u201dTan Limei had average looks, but she was very talkative. She was able to chat with anyone and dares to say everything. During lunch in the cafeteria, located on the northern side of the compound, she told them all sorts of gossips.But thanks to her, Dong Xuebing learned a lot about this office.In other agencies, the General Affairs Department and the administrative office were the same things. But as the State Security was a particular unit, there were many confidential documents. This was why the General Affairs Department here had a separate office to handle meeting materials, writing and editing Leaders\u2019 speeches, transferring of files, and other miscellaneous stuff. The Chief of this office was Deputy Divisional Chief rank, and he does not really care about the work here. He let his Deputy Chief Zhou, take charge of everything in the office. Zhou Changchun was in his 50s, and his health was not very good. He often needs to take sick leaves.Under Deputy Chief Zhou, were the staff members like them.Old Yan was the most senior in the office. But many years ago, he had offended a leader from City\u2019s State Security Bureau and could not be promoted. He was now in his 50s and was still a staff member, despite almost reaching his retirement age. He had also got over it. He just comes to work and read the newspaper the whole day. He will not do any work and does not care about everything.Guo Panwei was an ambitious person. He likes to hang around the leaders bootlicking, and he knows most of the leaders.Guo Shunjie had someone in the Bureau. Hearsay, the District Director / Political Commissar, was good friends with his father. This was why, other than Deputy Chief Zhou, Guo Shunjie does not listen or care about anyone else. He thinks he was the \u201cbiggest\u201d among the staff members.Changjuan in her 30s. Although her looks were average, she likes to doll up and flirts with the leaders. She looks like she was hoping to be some leaders\u2019 mistress.Tan Limei was the only person in the office that does actual work. She handles almost all the documents in the office.That\u2019s the situation in this office.Offices\u2026\u2026 were complicated\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was beautiful with her fair complexion and hourglass figure. Tan Limei and Changjuan were too far away compared to her. Even the prettiest girl in Dong Xuebing\u2019s university could not be compared to Qu Yunxuan\u2019s beauty.\u201cAunt Xuan.\u201d During breakfast, Dong Xuebing could not help but praise her. \u201cYou are so pretty today.\u201dBut after saying that, he immediately regrets. Why did I mention that?Qu Yunxuan blushed. She stared at Dong Xuebing and pretended like she was going to hit him: \u201cYou want me to hit you?\u201dDong Xuebing kept quiet and quickly continued with his breakfast.\u201cEat slowly. No one will eat your food.\u201d Qu Yunxuan rolled her eyes and wipe the corner of his lips with a paper napkin. She asked gently: \u201cHow was your first day of work yesterday? Aunt Xuan has a piece of advice for you. Watch what you say at work. There are a lot of unspoken rules in the workplace. If you offended any leaders unconsciously, it would be hard for you to carry on working there. So, talk less work more. If you need to bootlick your superiors, then you bootlick them. Do you remember what I said?\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cYes.\u201dAfter breakfast, Dong Xuebing bid Qu Yunxuan farewell and left for work.At the foot of the apartment building, Dong Xuebing met Mrs. Xu and her son. She seemed to be bringing her son out and was flagging for a taxi. When Mrs. Xu saw Dong Xuebing, she battered her eyelid and smiles. \u201cXiao Bing, are you going to work? How is your work?\u201d Mrs. Xu\u2019s attitude towards Dong Xuebing changed a lot after the latter became a Civil Servant. She was no longer arrogant like before.Dong Xuebing replied: \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Things were slightly busier in the morning, and I have not much work in the afternoon.\u201dXiao Dong looked at him with a black face and entered the taxi.Mrs. Xu also opened the door of the taxi and said: \u201cWe will make a move first. Xiao Dong wants to visit the antique market.\u201d\u201cBye.\u201d Haha, things change when I entered the government service. I am still not even an official.With a relaxed mood, Dong Xuebing boarded a public bus to the Western District Branch Bureau. He smiled to the old guard at the guardhouse and entered the compound with some other staff members he did not know. He walked to the grey building and entered the office. After putting his things at his desk, he picked up a broom and start sweeping the office.In the past, cleaning up the office was Guo Panwei\u2019s duties. He did that was to show how \u201chardworking\u201d he was to the leaders. But after Deputy Chief Zhou was hospitalized last week, Guo Panwei no longer cleans up the office. Why? Because the leader was not around to see him working. Why should he do it?\u201cOh, Xiao Dong? Why are you so early today?\u201d Guo Shunjie walked in with his bag.Dong Xuebing smiled: \u201cThere are no traffic jams this morning, so I arrived early.\u201dSoon, Guo Panwei and Changjuan entered the office together, chatting.Tan Limei was the fifth person to arrive, and Zhuang Zhi was the sixth. Old Yan was the last to reach the office.The workload on Wednesday was much lower than Monday and Tuesday. Dong Xuebing saw that Tan Limei does not need his help, he took a mop and clean the toilet outside the corridor. He also mopped the hallway outside the office. Someone had dirtied the area with spit and melon seeds shells.While Dong Xuebing was cleaning up, he heard footsteps at the end of the corridor.He looked up and saw a man in his 50s, walking slowly towards his direction. That man was walking with a slight limp. His left leg could take a bigger step than his right. He looked like he had a mild stroke before. Dong Xuebing knew that this person should be the Deputy Chief Zhou Changchun, who was hospitalized last week. He was the head of this General Affairs office.Dong Xuebing wanted to leave a good impression with the leader, and he pretended not to see him. He continued to mop the floor diligently.\u201cYou are?\u201d Zhou Changchun asked puzzledly.Dong Xuebing pretended to just notice him, and he paused for a while, wiping his sweat from his forehead: \u201cAh\u2026\u2026 You must be Deputy Chief Zhou? Nice to meet you. I am just posted to this office. My name is Dong Xuebing, you\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Changchun just gave a short reply and entered the office: \u201cOk.\u201d\u201cDeputy Chief Zhou, i\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing thought the leader will ask him some questions, but he just walks past him. He was thinking in his heart, what\u2019s wrong with the leader?But when Dong Xuebing thought Deputy Chief Zhou was someone very stern and does not speak much, he heard Zhou Changchun greeted the rest of the staff members in a friendly manner. \u201cThanks for working hard everyone. Haha, did anything important happen when I am in the hospital?\u201dTan Limei joked: \u201cChief Zhou, you still don\u2019t trust us?\u201dChangjuan also laughed seductively: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Chief Zhou, since when did we create problems for you?\u201dGuo Panwei also walked over to Deputy Chief Zhou: \u201cI will help you brew a cup of tea.\u201d\u201cChief Zhou, are you feeling better?\u201d Guo Shunjie asked.Dong Xuebing was stunned, and he slapped his forehead. He realized why Zhou Changchun treated him so coldly. Everyone in the office addressed him as Chief Zhou, leaving out the word Deputy. Dong Xuebing was the foolish one who greeted him as Deputy Chief Zhou. Although it was just a word, there was a huge difference. People will feel better without the word Deputy. It also shows that you respected that leader. This was an unspoken rule in the government sector. Everyone does this.Actually, Dong Xuebing also knew about this rule. Grandpa Hu had told him about this in the hospital. But Dong Xuebing did not really pay attention to this. But now, he was accepted into the government sector, and he had offended his direct superior on his second day of work. This was a grave mistake.Dong Xuebing quickly shouted: \u201cBack!\u201d\u2026\u2026The surroundings changed.Melon seeds shells appeared on the clean floor again.Tap, tap, tap. It was the sound of footsteps.\u201cYou are?\u201d Zhou Changchun pale looking face appeared in front of Dong Xuebing.\u201cAh? You must be Chief Zhou?\u201d Dong Xuebing replied energetically. \u201cI am the new staff member. My name is Dong Xuebing. Nice to meet you, Chief Zhou.\u201dZhou Changchun smiled and nodded. \u201cYou seem energetic. You started yesterday? How are you adapting?\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cThank you, leader, for asking. I had familiarized myself with the work.\u201dZhou Changchun patted Dong Xuebing on his shoulders: \u201cGood. Work hard.\u201dZhou Changchun\u2019s attitude was totally different now.Dong Xuebing wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead. So close.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Guo Panwei was had not been doing anything the past two days was very hardworking. He not only helped Tan Limei with her task, but he also helps Chief Zhou clean up his office. Every 10-20 minutes, he would go into Chief Zhou\u2019s office to help him pour tea. Changjuan even did not touch up her makeup in office. She and Guo Shunjie were pretending to work hard. The only person who was still the same was Old Yan. He was still reading newspapers at his desk.\u201cXuebing.\u201d The big size Zhuang Zhi who was sitting opposite asked: \u201cWhat is the password for Word read-only documents?\u201dDong Xuebing walked over and look at the monitor. He pressed some keys on the number pad. \u201cI think it is 5776.\u201dBut the file still could not be opened. The password was wrong.Tan Limei who was sitting not far away turned to face them and smiled: \u201cExcel is 5776, Word is 3328. The both of you must remember the passwords. Not only you need these password to open documents, but you also need to set password access for all your documents. Hahaha. Although we cannot access to confidential documents here, we still need to follow these protocols.\u201d She lowered her voice: \u201cThe both of you still have not seen the Confidential Files department. They were stricter than us. Their computers cannot even access the internet.\u201dAfter the past few days, Dong Xuebing, Zhuang Zhi and Tan Limei became closer.The 3 of them had just graduated from university not long ago and were about the same age. Compared to Changjuan, Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei, who were in their 30s, the 3 of them had more common topics. The 3 of them were also more down to earth and does not have too many ideas.Suddenly Chief Zhou\u2019s office door opened.Guo Panwei immediately picked up his pen and start to scribble on his notebook. He looks like he was working hard. Changjuan, who was seated the nearest to Chief Zhou\u2019s room, immediately closed the Tao Bao page on her monitor. Tan Limei also minimized her QQ windows. From Dong Xuebing\u2019s seat, he could see Guo Shunjie resizing the window of the aquarium fish forum to the smallest. Even Old Yan who had been reading newspapers stood up and walked to the water dispenser to get a cup of water.Shua, shua, shua\u2026\u2026 Gazhi\u2026\u2026 gazhi\u2026\u2026The only sounds in the office were typing and photocopier machine.Zhou Changchun nodded with satisfaction. He walked around the office and see what the staff members were writing or typing. After a while, he slowly walked back to his room and close the door. The next moment, things returned back to normal. They returned to read newspapers, shopping on Taobao, and whatever they had been doing.After a while, two men whom Dong Xuebing had never met before, came to the General Affairs office. The younger man waited outside and the older man, in his 30s entered. He was carrying some documents in a brown envelope. That man looked at Changjuan who nearest to him and then looked at Chief Zhou\u2019s room. Changjuan nodded, and that man walked over to knock on the door. He entered the room, and when he left with the young man, he was not holding on to the envelope.5 to 6 minutes later.Ring, ring, ring. The phone beside the printer rang.Tan Limei picked up the phone: \u201cHello, this is the General Affairs Office\u2026\u2026 Oh, Chief Zhou\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026\u201d After hanging up, she looked at Dong Xuebing and said: \u201cXuebing, Chief Zhou is looking for you. There is a document to be sent to the Confidential Files department. He said, after getting the document from him, Guo Shunjie will show you the way there and teach you the procedures. Guo Shunjie are you busy now?\u201d According to the regulations, any confidential documents have to be escorted by 2 people.Guo Shunjie replied: \u201cNo problem. I will bring him there.\u201d\u201cThen I will go and get the documents now.\u201d Dong Xuebing walked over to Chief Zhou\u2019s room. This was his first task given by his leader. He must do a good job.Knock, knock. \u201cCome in.\u201dThe way Chief Zhou speaks was authoritative. Being a leader was so good. He could just open his door and call for Dong Xuebing to deliver the document. But if he does that, he will not look like a leader. This was why he called the office phone and called for Dong Xuebing. His office was only a few meters away from Dong Xuebing desk. Even if he raised his voice slightly, Dong Xuebing could hear him.Zhou Changchun was sitting in front of a monitor and writing something. \u201cSit and wait a while.\u201dDong Xuebing replied politely and sat down on a leather couch in the office. The leather couch was old, and some parts were peeling. But it was very soft. It was more comfortable than the couch outside in the main office. Dong Xuebing was a bit tired from his work, and he leaned back onto the couch. He relaxed his back muscle.Comfortable.Zhou Changchun glanced at him and continued writing without saying a word.Dong Xuebing had good vision, and from where he was sitting, he could see what was on Chief Zhou\u2019s monitor. It was a Golden Sun Shares Trading program. Eh? Chief Zhou also trades in shares?Dozens of seconds passed, and Zhou Changchun stopped writing. But he still did not pass the document to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing was puzzled. He thought about why he was called in when the documents were not ready.He had heard of stories about the leader purposely ask someone to wait for one side while he does something. It might be the leader does not like that person. But Dong Xuebing thought about what he had done and does not understand what he did wrong. Yesterday he had address Chief Zhou wrongly, but he had used back to correct it. This morning, he also did not do anything wrong. What\u2019s the reason for Chief Zhou to dislike him?When he was thinking, Guo Shunjie knocked on the door and entered the room. \u201cChief Zhou, I am here to collect the document.\u201dZhou Changchun replied: \u201cSeat and wait for a while.\u201dZhou Shunjie nodded and walked to the couch. He saw Dong Xuebing sitting comfortably on the couch. His lips twitched. He thought in his heart. This newcomer still does not learn the rules? He sat down on the couch with only half his bottom touching the couch and his body upright.Dong Xuebing saw this and was stunned. Damn! Tan Limei had said that Guo Shunjie had someone backing him in the City Bureau. Why was he still so tense when sitting? Dong Xuebing was not stupid. He immediately realized the unspoken rule. Although Guo Shunjie was not afraid of Chief Zhou, he still must abide by the rules. If not, the leader will feel that you do not have respect for him.Fuck!I did something wrong again.Back!\u2026\u2026Swish, swish, swish. It was the sounds of the pen writing on paper. Chief Zhou was writing something.The time had returned to before Zhou Shunjie entered the room.Dong Xuebing looked around and realized that he was leaning back on the couch. Chief Zhou still had not noticed him. He immediately sat upright with half his bottom touching the edge of the couch. He placed both his hands on his lap looking straight.2 seconds later, Chief Zhou looked over and saw Dong Xuebing with a serious expression. Chief Zhou nodded and passed the document to him. He smiled. \u201cOk. Send this document to the Confidential Department. Haha, you don\u2019t need to be so serious.\u201dDong Xuebing also smile. Don\u2019t be serious? Stop bullshitting me. If I am not sitting here pretending to be serious, will you be happy with me?Dong Xuebing walked out with the document. His back was all wet from his cold sweat.Officialdom\u2026\u2026 One wrong step and that\u2019s it.There were even rules about sitting postures.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at the thick stack of documents and frowned. He then stood up and walked towards Dong Xuebing, who was doing some data entries. He smiled and place the stack of papers on the desk: \u201cXiao Dong, are you busy? Go through these documents. Chief Zhou said that there were too many spelling mistakes. You need to amend it. He needs it by noon.\u201dShould this be your job?But Dong Xuebing wanted to maintain a good relationship with his colleagues. \u201cOk. I will do it now.\u201dGuo Shunjie nodded and returned to his desk. He crossed his legs and sat there drinking his tea.11.30 am. Dong Xuebing and Tan Limei went upstairs to deliver a document.On the way, Tan Limei asked softly: \u201cGuo Shunjie asked you to do his task for him again?\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. \u201cWe are colleagues, and we should help each other.\u201d\u201cHmph! What help each other? Guo Shunjie likes to order the newcomers around because he knows the District Political Commissar. He acts as if he is the leader in the office. When I just arrived here, he had also asked me for lots of things. It\u2019s so sickening.\u201d Tan Limei grumbled. \u201cOh, before you and Sun Zhuang came, there was a hardworking young man. But he left because of Guo Shunjie. Who can tolerate being ordered around by him?\u201dDong Xuebing was surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWhy should I lie to you?\u201d Tan Limei did not say any more. \u201cJust be careful.\u201d\u201cI will. Thanks for telling me.\u201d Dong Xuebing was thinking. Being in an organization was so much different than in school.During lunch, Dong Xuebing passed the documents back to Guo Shunjie. \u201cBrother Guo, it\u2019s done.\u201dGuo Shunjie did not say anything and flipped the document and read a few pages. He nodded. \u201cGood. Thank you.\u201d Guo Shunjie saw Guo Panwei, Changjuan and the rest going out for lunch, he patted the empty seat beside him. \u201cXiao Dong, sit. Let\u2019s have a chat.\u201dDong Xuebing sat down: \u201cWhat is it?\u201dWhen both were the only ones left in the office, Guo Shunjie smiled and said: \u201cI think you are a smart person. You are much smarter than Sun Zhuang. What are your plans for your future? Have you have thought about it? Do you have any goals?\u201d Guo Shunjie\u2019s tone was like a leader asking his subordinate.Dong Xuebing cursed in his heart and half-heartedly replied: \u201cNo. I still do not know if I could keep my position as a staff member. I think I need to have some good results first.\u201d Not everyone who became a civil servant will have an iron rice bowl. According to the rules, if a newly posted civil servant received \u201cBad\u201d appraisal continuously for 2 years, he will be asked to go. Of course, very few agencies will do this unless the person\u2019s performance was atrocious, or he had offended some leaders.Guo Shunjie laughed. \u201cStop your pretenses. You have entered this office for a few days, and you should have heard about it.\u201d He was referring to his relationships with the leaders. \u201cXiao Dong, if you follow me I can help you. I should be promoted latest by next year. When the time comes, I can easily give you a helping hand. There is nothing to lose.\u201d He was very straightforward.Huh? What\u2019s the meaning of this? He tries to pull me over to his side? Follow him?But you are also not a leader. Do I need to follow you?Dong Xuebing knew that if he became Guo Shunjie\u2019s follower, Guo Shunjie would surely order him around. He might even have to serve him tea. Promotion? He does not have the authority to promote anybody. Also if he had the power to promote someone and he refuses to promote Dong Xuebing, there was nothing Dong Xuebing could do. This was like a blank cheque.Dong Xuebing wants to be promoted, but he was not stupid. After thinking for a while, he replied: \u201cBrother Guo, thank you for thinking so highly of me. But I have just entered the General Affairs Department, and I am still learning the ropes. I just want to focus on the tasks on hand. I hope\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing had to reject Guo Shunjie nicely. Dong Xuebing also did not want to offend anyone, especially those with backgrounds.Guo Shunjie\u2019s face changes instantly. \u201cI have given you a chance. Have you thought it through?\u201d He had asked the District\u2019s Political Commissar committee for a promotion. He was thinking of how to get his own men to be transferred over to the new department if he got promoted next year. Bringing his own men to the new workplace would make his job easier. This was why he wanted to rope Dong Xuebing in. But Dong Xuebing rejected him, and he felt he had lost face.Dong Xuebing hesitated for a while and replied: \u201cI really thank you for your offer, but I\u2026\u2026\u201dGuo Shunjie immediately stood up with a grimace face: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you!\u201d Dong Xuebing had successfully aggroed him.Dong Xuebing slapped his forehead. Damn. In less than a week, I had offended my colleague.2 pm.Guo Shunjie walked out of Chief Zhou\u2019s room and walked straight to Dong Xuebing\u2019s desk. He threw a stack of documents on the desk: \u201cCopy 5 sets. Don\u2019t mess up the pages. I want it before 4 pm.\u201d Guo Shunjie\u2019s tone was like a superior giving order to a subordinate.Everyone in the office looked over. All of them wondered how did Dong Xuebing offend Guo Shunjie.Dong Xuebing was furious. This was Guo Shunjie\u2019s true colors. He really wanted to give him a kick in his face.If I follow you, I will be your underlings. If I don\u2019t follow you, I still have to do your work. What other choices do I have? Damn. I had never seen anyone so unreasonable.What a bitch.After a while, Guo Shunjie went to the restroom for a smoke. Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi asked: \u201cXuebing, what happened?\u201dDong Xuebing replied with a forced smile: \u201cNothing.\u201dBoth saw that Dong Xuebing was not willing to say and they did not press on further. They returned back to their tasks.Guo Panwei who was sitting nearby, looked at Dong Xuebing: \u201cXiao Dong, are you busy?\u201d He pointed to a box beside him. \u201cI am busy now. Help me bring these to the Finance Department later.\u201d Guo Panwei saw Dong Xuebing could be bullied and he also passed him his tasks. After that, he entered Chief Zhou\u2019s office to brew tea for him.Damn it!When will this ever stop?Dong Xuebing almost cursed out loud. Both Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei were assholes.Dong Xuebing finally understood \u201cBeing nice will be bullied.\u201d He clenched his fist tightly. He knew that he must do something to get out of this. If not, he will have to remain as a lowly staff member forever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He became more familiar with the work there, but he felt the chances of being promoted was slim. There were too many unspoken rules at his workplace. He was new and still does not know many of these rules at work. Almost every day, he got to use his power \u201cBack\u201d to rectify his mistakes. Furthermore, Guo Shunjie was purposely making things difficult for him, and Guo Panwei had asked Dong Xuebing to do his task for him. The past few days, Dong Xuebing was suffering at work.Today.Dark clouds covered the sky, and it was drizzling.Dong Xuebing reached the office and kept his umbrella. He opened the office door: \u201cGood morning, Sis Chang, Tan Zhi, Zhuang Zhi.\u201dTan Limei scolded: \u201cBing Zhi, you are late today. Did you go out on a date last night?\u201dChangjuan was putting on her makeup, as usual. She turned to Dong Xuebing: \u201cXiao Dong, you have a girlfriend? Who is your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cDong Xuebing laughed: \u201cStop poking fun at me. Which girl will like me?\u201dGuo Shunjie knocked his desk a few times with his pen. \u201cXiao Dong, you are just in time. Here, do this.\u201d Dong Xuebing had lost count of the number of tasks given to him by Guo Shunjie in the past two weeks.Guo Panwei also waved to him: \u201cXiao Dong, after you are done with your task, come and help me.\u201dDong Xuebing gritted his teeth. These two bastards\u2026\u2026In the morning, Dong Xuebing delivered a few documents and returned to his desk. He was thinking about his prospects in this office.Suddenly he thought of an idea. He decided to apply to be a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Since Dong Xuebing\u2019s goal was to enter Central Bureau, then becoming a member of the CPC is essential. Once he was a member of the CPC, he would be able to build up his portfolio and increase his chances of promotion.Click, click, click\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing went online to search for information and fill in his application form.Dong Xuebing was able to complete his application form before the end of the say. Looking at the almost 10,000 words application letter, he felt proud of himself. He was amazed at what he could do when he focuses all his energy into it. When he was writing his thesis at University, he could only write about 5,000 words over 10 days. But now, it was for his promotion, and he was motivated.\u201cBing Xhi, what are you writing the whole afternoon?\u201d Zhuang Zhi, who was seated opposite Dong Xuebing asked.Dong Xuebing waved his application form: \u201cApplication to the CPC.\u201dZhuang Zhi scratched his head: \u201cYou are joining the CPC?\u201d\u201cOh, you also want to join the CPC?\u201d Tan Limei overheard their conversation. She smiled: \u201cI have submitted my application one year ago and had just become a Party Activist. I am still learning to about the Party\u2019s programmes and submitting periodical reports. I think I should be able to become a Probationary party member the year after next.\u201d\u201cI think I got to wait for 4 years.\u201d Dong Xuebing laughed. He knew the application process to be a CPC member would be very long. Even 3 years was considered short. \u201cOh, I should pass my application form to the Party Branch. Who is the secretary?\u201dTan Limei replied: \u201cYou can submit to Li Qing, Director Li. He oversees all the applications.\u201dLi Qing, General Affairs Department\u2019s Deputy Director, and General Affairs Office\u2019s Chief. He had a close relationship with Deputy Chief Zhou, and he let Deputy Chief Zhou take charge of the office. He only visits the office once in a while and let Deputy Chief Zhou handles all the work. Dong Xuebing had only met him 3 to 4 times from afar.Actually, Li Qing should be addressed as Chief Li as he was the head of this General Affairs Office. But \u2018Chief\u2019 does not sound better than the Director. His rank was Deputy Director. So, everyone addressed him as Director Li. This was one of the unspoken rules in the government sector. The lower levels must address the higher-ups with the best sounding titles.Suddenly, the office became quiet.Dong Xuebing looked up from his desk. Speaking of the devil, Deputy Director Li had entered the office.\u201cDirector Li.\u201d\u201cGood afternoon, Director Li.\u201dEveryone stood up and greeted Director Li.\u201cHi, carry on with your work.\u201d Li Qing waved his hand, gesturing them to return to their work.Li Qing was very skinny. Like bamboo. The feeling he gave others was cheerful and friendly, unlike Zhou Changchun. Zhou Changchun had a pretentious smile, whereas Li Qing seems more sincere. Li Qing\u2019s family was poor. His daughter had Leukaemia or some other illness. He was in financial difficulties. There were rumors that Tan Limei had wanted to help him raise funds for his daughter\u2019s medical treatment, but Li Qing stopped it for some unknown reasons.The other end of the main office, Zhou Changchun walked out of his room. \u201cChief.\u201dLi Qing, in his 40s, walked over and patted Zhou Changchun\u2019s arm: \u201cOld Zhou, you must take care of your health.:Zhou Changchun straightened his back and replied: \u201cThank you Chief for your concerns. I am fine.\u201dZhou Changchun was the one person who addressed Li Qing as Chief.Dong Xuebing had asked his senior Tan Limei about this. There was a lot more to the way Zhou Changchun address Li Qing as \u2018Chief\u201d. This was not a mistake. It was to show that he was grateful to Li Qing for letting him oversee the office. If he addressed Li Qing as \u2018Director\u2019 like the rest of the people, it would show that he was arrogant and had taken over Li Qing\u2019s role as Chief. This was to imply to Li Qing that he was still the person in charge of General Affairs Office and Zhou Changchun had not forgotten that.There were too many of such complicated rules there.Dong Xuebing was still learning about these unspoken rules.After a while, Li Qing walked past Dong Xuebing, and Dong Xuebing immediately passed his application form to him. Dong Xuebing said some \u201cfake, exaggerated claims\u201d about how much he wanted to enter the CPC, while Li Qing flipped through the pages of the application form. He gave Dong Xuebing some encouraging words and suddenly remembered something. He turned around and pass a document to Zhou Changchun.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Zhou Changchun took the document from him.Li Qing rubbed his temple: \u201cBureau Chief Yang is going to the City\u2019s Bureau office for a meeting. This is the contents of what he is going to say. Put in some effort and write a good speech for Bureau Chief Yang. Don\u2019t mess it up like the previous time. Old Zhou, I will leave this task to you. Don\u2019t let Bureau Chief Yang thinks that our General Affairs Office are all useless.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026.. We\u2026.. We will do this well.\u201d Zhou Changchun reluctantly replied.Dong Xuebing looked around. When everyone heard that they have to write a speech for Bureau Chief Yang, everyone\u2019s face changed.Huh?What\u2019s happening?Only Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi who did not know what was going on were confused.What\u2019s so difficult about writing a speech?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGeneral Affairs Office.The office was dead silence after Deputy Director Li left. Zhou Changchun frowned and rubbed his forehead. He was looked through the document in his hand and then looked around the office. \u201cThis is about the same as last time. Bureau Chief Yang did not give any specific instructions. Xiao Tan?\u201dTan Limei, who had never complained about her work looked at Zhou Changchun pitifully. \u201cChief Zhou, please let me off.\u201dZhou Changchun gave some encouragement: \u201cWriting speeches have always been your job. As a university graduate, it should be an easy task. You can\u2019t expect me or Old Yan to write it, do you?\u201dTan Limei sighed: \u201cChief Zhou, you also know that Bureau Chief Yang\u2019s expectations were so high. The last time, Sis Chang, Guo Panwei and I had spent 2 days on his speech. We wrote 6 versions, and he did not use any of them. I was still scolded by him. I\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Changchun interrupted: \u201cBureau Chief Yang told me that he has high hopes for you. This time, you should put in more effort.\u201dTan Limei lowered her head and replied reluctantly: \u201cFine. I will try.\u201dZhou Changchun looked at Guo Panwei and the rest: \u201cPanwei, Xiao Chang and Shunjie, all of you will also write a draft. Do your best.\u201dChangjuan immediately said: \u201cSir, I am not good at writing. Bureau Chief Yang will surely not use my draft.Guo Shunjie also said: \u201cChief Zhou, I\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Changchun was slightly pissed and knocked on the desk: \u201cLook at all of you. What are all of you trying to do? No matter how difficult this task is, all of you still have to do it. This is your job! Start working now and tomorrow send the drafts to Bureau Chief Yang.\u201d Zhou Changchun was also afraid of Bureau Chief Yang. Bureau Chief Yang was not satisfied with the General Affairs Office\u2019s drafts the previous time. Not only the staff workers were scolded, even Li Qing and he were reprimanded. This was why Li Qing and Zhou Changchun were troubled when they knew Bureau Chief Yang wanted them to write out his speech again.After work.Dong Xuebing walked up to Tan Limei: \u201cTan Zhi, let\u2019s leave together.\u201dTan Limei listlessly sighed: \u201cWhat bus are you taking?\u201d\u201cNumber 46.\u201d Dong Xuebing walked out to the pouch with her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it tough to write the speech?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult if it was for other Bureau Chiefs. The rest does not even need to write a draft, and I alone am enough. But this Bureau Chief Yang is different. He\u2026\u2026 He\u2026\u2026\u201d After Tan Limei\u2019s explanation, Dong Xuebing understood what happened. Bureau Chief Yang\u2019s full name was Yang Yizhong. He was the Bureau Branch Deputy Divisional Chief. He was transferred over from East City Branch not too long ago, and the staffs were not familiar with him. They only knew that this Deputy Chief had a bad temper and had high expectations for his speeches. He was not interested to even look through the drafts. A while ago, the whole General Affairs Office were scolded by him.Dong Xuebing thought deeply about what Tan Limei said.The next day.The first thing Zhou Changchun asked when he stepped into the office was the drafts.Tan Limei replied weakly: \u201cI have finished the draft, but I am not sure if Bureau Chief Yang will approve it.\u201dGuo Panwei, Guo Shunjie, and Changjuan had the same facial expressions as Tan Limei. They were all not confident.\u201cOk.\u201d Chief Zhou said. \u201cSend the drafts over and see what Bureau Chief Yang says.\u201dDong Xuebing looked at those 4 people who left for to the \u201cExecution Grounds.\u201d After they left, Dong Xuebing opened a few Word documents and look at the samples of speeches. He had downloaded these examples from the internet last night. He had learned about the sentencing structures and the words used.1 minute\u2026\u20265 minutes\u2026\u202610 minutes\u2026\u2026Guo Shunjie was the first to return.\u201cChief Zhou, Bureau Chief Yang says that my draft is not structured well enough.\u201dThe next person to return was Guo Panwei. \u201cBureau Chief Yang says\u2026\u2026 he says\u2026\u2026\u201d Bureau Chief Yang might have said something very nasty, and Guo Panwei was too embarrassed to tell Chief Zhou. \u201cHe asked me to rewrite.\u201dChangjuan also returned with an awful expression. \u201cMy draft did not make it.\u201dThe last to return was Tan Limei. Everyone looked at her and asked: \u201cHow was it?\u201dTan Limei did not say anything and returned to her desk and started sobbing.Zhou Changchun understood immediately. She must be scolded by Bureau Chief Yang too. Sighed\u2026\u2026 What\u2019s wrong? How come no one could write a draft that can appease Bureau Chief Yang? If this carries on, Bureau Chief Yang will think that the General Affairs Office had no one capable.Ring, ring, ring. Zhou Changchun\u2019s office phone rang, and he immediately went to pick it up. \u201cHello? \u2026\u2026 Oh, Bureau Chief Yang\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 Ah\u2026\u2026 Ok\u2026\u2026 I understand\u2026.. but we\u2026\u2026 Ok\u2026\u2026 Then\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026. I will ask them to rewrite\u2026 Yes\u2026. Rest assure\u2026\u2026\u201dOutside of the office, Zhuang Zhi was trying to comfort Tan Limei.Zhou Changchun rubbed his temples and slowly walked out: \u201cBureau Chief Yang said that the City Bureau\u2019s meeting has been brought forward to tomorrow. So, no matter what, he wants to see the speech today. Let\u2019s do our best and write out a speech which meets his requirements. Go through the first drafts and see if we had missed out anything.\u201dTan Limei who was still crying: \u201cI\u2026\u2026 I had written the draft based on what he wanted\u2026\u2026.\u201dChangjuan: \u201cChief Zhou, we really tried out best.\u201dZhou Changchun sighed: \u201cI know this is not an easy task. But this is the task given to us by the higher-ups. We must complete it. Let\u2019s put our brains together and think of a solution.Everyone in the office lowered their heads, and no one said a word.Zhou Changchun frowned and wanted to say something, but Dong Xuebing slowly stood up.Zhou Changchun looked at him: \u201cOh? Xiao Dong have an idea?\u201d\u201cHuh? It\u2019s not what idea.\u201d Dong Xuebing smiled embarrassedly. \u201cChief Zhou, if there are really no other ways, can I try?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d Zhou Changchun paused for a while. \u201cYou know how to write speeches?\u201dDong Xuebing does not dare to claim that he was good at writing speeches. He does not want to let other people think he was too proud. \u201cA little.\u201d\u201cFine. Go ahead and try.\u201d Zhou Changchun did not have many expectations from this new guy. Even the drafts written by the experts from the office were not accepted by Bureau Chief Yang, let alone this newcomer. Zhou Changchun thought to just let him try.Dong Xuebing felt that this was an opportunity for him!An opportunity to shine!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe whole morning, everyone in the office was rushing out the drafts.Zhou Changchun did not only asked Dong Xuebing to write a draft. To be safe, he asked everyone in the office to draft out a speech, hoping Bureau Chief Yang would be satisfied with one of them.Dong Xuebing wrote confidently. Although he had not met Yang Yizhong before, from the rejection of Tan Limei and the rest drafts, he concludes that Bureau Chief Yang must be a \u201cscholarly\u201d person since he was so fussy about his speech. So, Dong Xuebing wrote the draft using flowery words. He put in some idioms and references from Classic literature into his drafts.Dong Xuebing stopped typing at lunch. He looked at his monitor and nodded.Alright. This should do it. Xuebing\u2026. This is your chance to shine in front of the leader.Dong Xuebing went upstairs to Yang Yizhong\u2019s office with his speech draft. He took in a deep breath and knocked on the door confidently.\u201cCome in.\u201dDong Xuebing entered the room and saw Yang Yizhong. Dong Xuebing was shocked by his appearance. Yang Yizhong looked nothing \u201cScholarly\u201d as he imagined. He looks rugged. But Dong Xuebing thought that looks can be deceiving. Maybe he had a \u201cScholar\u201d living underneath this appearance.Yang Yizhong frowned, squeezing his thick eyebrows together. \u201cWho are you?\u201dDong Xuebing replied politely: \u201cI am Dong Xuebing. I am new to the General Affairs Office.\u201d\u201cOh. Is the speech ready?\u201d Bureau Chief Yang stretched out his hand. \u201cLet me take a look.\u201dDong Xuebing excitedly passed an A4 paper to him and stood there waiting for praises. He wants to claim this credit, and everyone in the office will look at him differently when he returns.But in just 3 seconds, Dong Xuebing\u2019s daydreams were shattered. Bureau Chief Yang threw the draft back at Dong Xuebing.\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d Yang Yizhong had a dark expression, and he banged the desk. \u201cRubbish!\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s face turns green. \u201cAh?\u201d Have you even read it?Yang Yizhong shouted: \u201cWhat is wrong with the General Affairs Office? I just wanted a simple speech. What\u2019s so difficult? Especially you! I wanted you to write a speech according to my topic. What did you write?\u201d Yang Yizhong pointed to the first few lines of the draft. \u201cKnowing honor and stop to achieve prosperity. What are you talking about? Ah? What the fuck are you writing?\u201dDong Xuebing weakly replied: \u201cBureau Chief Yang, you misread it. It is \u2018Knowing Honor and understanding shame to achieve prosperity.\u2019\u201dDong Xuebing had touched Yang Yizhong\u2019s nerves with that sentence, and he burst out in anger: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?! I only have primary school standard of education and does not know many characters!\u201dDong Xuebing was in a daze. Fuck! Was this a joke? This guy was not the \u201cScholarly\u201d type? Doesn\u2019t he have high expectations of his speeches? Primary school standard? Damn! He was an illiterate and not a scholar!Oh shit! I am in trouble!Dong Xuebing knew he had offended Yang Yizhong and immediately shouts: \u201cBACK!\u201d\u2026\u2026The shouting ceased.There was only the ticking of the second hand of a clock.\u201cYou are?\u201d Yang Yizhong looked at Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing immediately knew which time it was now. He was relieved and replied: \u201cI am Dong Xuebing. I am new to the General Affairs Office.\u201d\u201cOh. Is the speech ready?\u201d Bureau Chief Yang stretched out his hand. \u201cLet me take a look.\u201dDong Xuebing will never let him look at his draft. He hides the draft behind his back and thought of an excuse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Bureau Chief Yang. It is not ready yet. I am here to ask what time is the latest deadline.\u201dYang Yizhong frowned impatiently: \u201cDidn\u2019t I say I want it as soon as possible?\u201d\u201cSorry for disturbing you. I will go back now.\u201dYang Yizhong stood at the window after Dong Xuebing left. He lit a cigarette and stared outside. He had started work early at a chemical factory in the outskirts of Beijing, and then he followed his leader to join the government sector. His education level was very low and does not know a lot of Chinese characters. This was why he rejected all the General Affairs Office speech drafts and did not tell them the reason. How to tell them the real reason? Tell them that he only has a primary school education? He is illiterate? He was too embarrassed to say it. If the General Affairs Office still cannot give him a draft that satisfies him, he will have to look for his old subordinates from the East City Branch to write his speech.Before Dong Xuebing returned to the office, he threw away his draft. This stupid draft had almost cost him his career. Luckily, he was able to use BACK. If not, it was the end of his life there.Tan Limei and the rest had returned from their lunch and saw Dong Xuebing entering the office. She asked: \u201cBing Zhi, how is your draft?\u201d\u201cAh? Almost done\u2026.\u201dGuo Shunjie commented sarcastically that he was too eager to perform. Even the seniors of the office could not write the draft, yet Dong Xuebing wanted to try.Changjuan pushed her keyboard away from her: \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t write anymore!\u201dGuo Panwei also scratched his head in frustration.Tan Limei grumbled: \u201cWhat sort of speech does he want? I had already tried my best.\u201dOld Yan was the only one that was calm in the office. He was still reading his newspapers relaxingly. As if it was none of his concern.Dong Xuebing had no time to chat with the rest. He sat behind his monitor and was typing furiously. He knew what Yang Yizhong wanted, and he was able to write out the draft effortlessly. Idioms? References from classics? Those must not be in the draft.Simple and straight forward.The speech must be very simple and straight forward.Speech: Dear leaders. This topic I will be talking about is . After typing this, Dong Xuebing immediately felt this was wrong and deleted it. No. Deputy Bureau Chief Yang might not know this character. He changed it to . Yes. These are all simple words.Dong Xuebing thought hard about the words and continued to type.It was not easy to write in primary school\u2019s choice of words. This speech must be simple, and the contents must be straight forward. It was really challenging for Dong Xuebing.\u201cHuh? Bureau Chief Yang?\u201d\u201cBureau Chief Yang!\u201dTan Limei and the rest immediately stop what they were doing. All of them could feel the hairs on their back standing.Yang Yizhong had a gloomy expression when he asked: \u201cIs the speech ready? Almost half the day is gone!\u201dZhou Changchun walked out of his room quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s done, and I was about to send them to you. Xiao Tan, Xiao Chang, bring the drafts over.\u201dWith Zhuang Zhi and the other two Guo, there were a total of 5 drafts.Yang Yizhong took the drafts and scanned through: \u201cNo\u2026\u2026. Wrong\u2026\u2026. This is also not right\u2026\u2026 What is this? This too\u2026. Cannot\u2026.\u201d Within a minute, all the drafts were rejected. \u201cOld Zhou, your General Affairs Office can\u2019t even write a simple speech?\u201dTan Limei and the rest lowered their heads.\u201cBureau Chief Yang, we\u2026\u2026\u201d Even if it were one rank higher, heads would roll. Furthermore, Yang Yizhong was several ranks above Zhou Changchun. If he was unhappy with Zhou Changchun, Zhou Changchun might not be able to be the Deputy Chief for long. This was why Zhou Changchun tried to establish a good relationship with this new Deputy Bureau Chief. But now, his plans were in jeopardy.Zhou Changchun was also getting pissed, but he could not show it in front of Deputy Bureau Chief Yang. He stared at Guo Shunjie and the rest. All of his subordinates seem capable and eager on regular days, but during crucial times, all of them were useless.\u201cBureau Chief Yang.\u201d Dong Xuebing took the printout from the printer. \u201cMy draft is done.\u201dGuo Panwei looked at Dong Xuebing and thought to himself. Was this idiot fearless or ignorant? You hand up your draft now? Are you looking for a scolding from Bureau Chief Yang?Yang Yizhong had lost his patience and did not say a word when he took the draft from Dong Xuebing.Everyone in the office sighed in their hearts and closed their eyes, waiting for another round of scoldings.1 minute\u2026\u20262 minutes\u2026\u20263 minutes\u2026\u2026No scolding was heard. After a while, everyone was shocked. Yang Yizhong laughed. He raised his right hand and hit on the draft a few times. \u201cLook at what he has written. This is the speech I want.\u201dThis outcome had made everyone in the office speechless.Yang Yizhong patted Zhou Changchun\u2019s back: \u201cOld Zhou. Seems like your General Affairs Office have strong potential. Not bad\u2026\u2026\u201d Yang Yizhong turned and look at Dong Xuebing. He nodded: \u201cI remember your name is Dong\u2026\u2026 Dong Xuebing right? Good job. In the future, you will be in charge of writing my speech.\u201d\u201cThank you, Bureau Chief Yang.\u201d Being able to leave an impression with the leaders was rare. Dong Xuebing straighten his back to try to look as smart as possible.The office was in chaos after Yang Yizhong left.Tan Limei was the first to ask: \u201cBing Zhi, what did you write? Why is Bureau Chief Yang so happy?\u201dChangjuan laughed: \u201cOur office has Crouching Tigers and Hidden Dragons.\u201dGuo Panwei stared at Dong Xuebing with jealousy.Guo Shunjie was not looking too good either. Why was that picky Bureau Chief Yang satisfied with Dong Xuebing\u2019s speech and the rest of them who had sent over 10 drafts were rejected?Dong Xuebing could not tell the rest that Yang Yizhong had a limited vocabulary. If Bureau Chief Yang knew he was the one who told others about this, he would be in trouble. So, Dong Xuebing explained that Yang Yizhong likes simple and clean words.After all of them saw the draft on Dong Xuebing\u2019s monitor, they understood what the meaning of \u201cSimple and Clean\u201d words was.Tan Limei was deeply impressed. She gave Dong Xuebing a thumbs up: \u201cTerrific.\u201dZhou Changchun also did not expect the problems lies in Yang Yizhong\u2019s education levels. He was impressed with Dong Xuebing\u2019s attention to details. He patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s back: \u201cGood work. You have done a great job.\u201d Zhou Changchun felt what the General Affairs Office lacks was someone like Dong Xuebing. Someone who would stand up and save the situation in critical moments.Translator\u2019s notes:Yang Yizhong had read Dong Xuebing\u2019s draft as \u77e5\u8363\u660e\u6b62, but what Dong Xuebing had written was \u77e5\u8363\u660e\u803b. This was some Chinese idioms. It meant to be righteous and not to do anything dishonorable.Crouching Tiger, Hidden DragonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because he had done something well, he could hold his head high.Dong Xuebing had just gotten his salary for his first month of work. He decided to give himself a treat by having a lavished breakfast at the roadside dumpling store. A bowl of goat innards soup, bake sesame cake and a tea leaves egg. Dong Xuebing had a good appetite, and after finishing all the food, he still did not feel full. He went to the crepe store to buy a crepe. He used up all his change in his pocket for this hearty meal.After a big burb and Dong Xuebing walked past the gates of Western District Bureau Branch.\u201cOh, the great hero is here.\u201d Tan Limei laughed and waved to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing was feeling good, but he did not show it on his face. He modestly said: \u201cWhat hero? It was only a coincident yesterday. In terms of writing, I am not as good as the rest of you.\u201dChangjuan, who was putting on lipstick, laughed. \u201cHehe, Xiao Dong is trying to be humble.\u201dOld Yan also laughed as he straightens his newspaper. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I heard after Chief Li Qing knew about this matter, he also praised you.\u201dDong Xuebing smiled: \u201cStop making fun of me. I am not as good as what you say.\u201dGuo Panwei was writing and drawing some lines at his desk. After Dong Xuebing sat down at his desk, he looked over to see what Guo Panwei was doing. Guo Panwei was drawing some candlestick chart and 5 days moving average of the stock index. Dong Xuebing knew Zhou Changchun love to trade shares, and Guo Panwei was trying to bootlick through shares trading. After all, there was only so much work the leader could assign to them. That was the duties of the staff workers. But if the staff worker could help the leader with his personal matters, then it will be different. The staff will be closer to the leader.9.30 am.Guo Panwei took the Candlestick Chart he was drawing into Deputy Chief Zhou\u2019s office. He remained in the room for about half an hour. At about 10 am, he came out of the room and close the door gently. He was grinning. He seems to be praise by Zhou Changchun.At the fax machine on the other end of the office, Tan Limei was organizing some documents. \u201cThere is a document that requires Chief Zhou\u2019s signature. Who is free to bring it to him?\u201dGuo Panwei raised his hand unconsciously. But he remembered that he had just come out of the office and he lowered his hand.\u201cI will do it.\u201d Dong Xuebing walked over and took the document to the small office room and knocked on the door.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Come in.\u201dDong Xuebing entered the room. \u201cChief Zhou, this document requires your signature.\u201dZhou Changchun held the few copies of A4 papers in his hand. He was looking at the stock daily charts on his monitor while reading the documents. If it were a few weeks ago, Zhou Changchun would surely minimize the window to not let Dong Xuebing see what he was doing. Now, Zhou Changchun got to know Dong Xuebing better and felt that he was an obedient young man. He does not mind Dong Xuebing knowing that he was trading shares at work. \u201cXiao Dong\u2026\u2026 Yesterday, the Chief had praised you over the phone. Good job. Continue to work hard.\u201d\u201cYes. I will not let all the leaders down\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing could feel Zhou Changchun\u2019s change of attitude towards him. He was jumping with joy in his heart. He immediately says some useless things that he will continue to work hard and do all the leaders proud, etc.After Dong Xuebing had finished, Zhou Changchun nodded and gestured to Dong Xuebing. \u201cSit.\u201dDong Xuebing sat down on the chair. He does not know where to look, so he looked at the monitor.It was the chart of a stock named Daqin Railway.Dong Xuebing remembered that the news had reported some news yesterday and railway and automobile shares had raised. From the charts, Daqin Railway shares had increased a lot. Since the start of the trading day, it had raised from 8.59 to 9.03 RMB. It then drops to 8.89 RMB, before rising to 9.25 RMB. It was almost at almost reaching the daily limit price.This was a good share.Dong Xuebing looked at Zhou Changchun and noticed he was smiling.After a while, Zhou Changchun had signed the document and smiled. \u201cHere. Take it.\u201dDong Xuebing used both hands to collect the documents from him and was about to leave. Zhou Changchun\u2019s eyes were still glued to the monitor.But 2 seconds later, Daqin Railway shares dropped suddenly. There was a trade of someone selling 12,000 shares. Half of these shares were bought out by the buying orders. Soon after, someone sold 8,000 shares, followed by 5,000. Immediately Daqin Railway share prices fell below 9 RMB. This happened almost instantly.Zhou Changchun slapped his leg and groaned. \u201cThe big players have sold the shares so early. If I knew, I should have sold the shares earlier.\u201dDong Xuebing who was about to leave the room heard this and turned around to look at the chart on the monitor. He knew that this was an opportunity.\u201cBACK!\u201d\u2026\u2026The scenery around Dong Xuebing changed.He was now facing another direction.Swooshed. Zhou Changchun was signing on the documents. He smiled: \u201cHere. Take it.\u201dDaqin Railway share prices were still hovering at about 9.26 RMB. It looks like it was about to reach 9.3 RMB.Although Dong Xuebing felt it was very sudden and rude, he does not want to give up this opportunity to be closer to the leader. He immediately points to the monitor: \u201cChief Zhou, if you own this share, you should sell it immediately. Yesterday, the automobile and railway shares had increased a lot. The speculators will be taking out their profits. From the current graph, it seems dangerous. The prices might fall anytime now.\u201dZhou Changchun frowned. He was not bothered by what Dong Xuebing said: \u201cReally? I think it will rise to the daily limits.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cI am not sure about the trend later this afternoon and the next few days. But before noon, Daqin Railway shares will fall below 9 RMB.\u201dZhou Changchun seems irritated and shook his head. He turned back to the monitor without saying a word.After being in the government sector for a few weeks, Dong Xuebing had learned a lot. He knows that if he remained in the office to look at Daqing Railway\u2019s share prices falling, he would be proving the leader wrong. The leader would not look good, and it was like giving him a slap on the face. The leader might even feel that Dong Xuebing was mocking him.Dong Xuebing immediately left the room and returned to his seat. He was looking at Chief Zhou\u2019s office door.5 minutes\u2026\u202610 minutes\u2026\u202620 minutes\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing keep looking at the door until it was almost lunchtime. He was about to leave the office with Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi for the cafeteria when Zhou Changchun walked out of his office. There was no change to his expressions. He chatted with Changjuan and Guo Panwei for a while, and when everyone was about to leave for lunch, Zhou Changchun called Dong Xuebing over. \u201cYou know shares trading?\u201dAlright. Here comes my opportunity!Dong Xuebing replied: \u201cYes. I know a little about the charts and graphs.\u201dZhou Changchun nodded and patted his shoulders. \u201cGo for your lunch. Help me look at the shares, tomorrow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He reached the office precisely on time.Tan Limei joked: \u201cBing Zhi, why are you so late today? Tell me. Did you go out on a date with your girlfriend last night?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled and placed his bag on his glass desk. \u201cStop making fun of me. I don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d Dong Xuebing had never dated any girls before while he was in school. He had average looks and was from a poor family. Without car and house, no girls were interested in him.\u201cOh?\u201d Changjuan laughed. \u201cDo you want elder sister here to introduce you some girls?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled: \u201cThank you, Sister Chang. I am currently good by myself.\u201d\u201cIf you are interested to know girls, tell me. I will keep a lookout for good girls for you.\u201dDong Xuebing did not really want to be single. He envied those with girlfriends. But with his looks and family background, it was hard to get a girlfriend. He rather focusses his energy on his career. Once he was promoted to be a leader, he will have money, and it will be easier to get girlfriends.10 minutes later, Zhou Changchun entered the office. It was the leader\u2019s privilege to be late. No one will say anything.Guo Panwei had been waiting. Once he heard the footsteps, he immediately went to brew a cup of tea.Guo Shunjie was pretending to be hard at work. After Chief Zhou had entered his office, he continued to laze around. He turned to Dong Xuebing: \u201cXiao Dong, you should clean up our office. Don\u2019t wait until Chief comes in and scold us. Later if you are free, mop the floor.\u201d The cleaner Old Wang will only clean up the corridors outside and send bottles of water to the office. The cleanliness of the offices was usually done by the staff workers.Dong Xuebing was pissed when he heard this. He was the one that cleans up the office the last time. He was also the one before the previous time. Why was it his turn again? Are you trying to challenge me? If it was Chief Zhou\u2019s instruction, I don\u2019t mind. But who are you to order me around? You asked me to do all your task at work, and you still want to boss me about non-work-related matters?Dong Xuebing had tolerated him for too long and was about to blow his top.Zhuang Zhi was really someone worthy to be friends with. He sensed the tension in the office and immediately say: \u201cI will clean up the office.\u201dDong Xuebing did not say anything and picked up a rag and clean the office with Zhuang Zhi.Guo Shunjie glanced at Dong Xuebing and snort.Everyone in the office was busily doing their things in the morning.Chief Zhou had gone for a meeting on level 3 and returned back at noon.At about 2.05 pm. Ring, ring, ring. The General Affairs Office\u2019s phone rang. Dong Xuebing happened to be at the photocopier and was the nearest to the phone. He reached over and answered: \u201cHello. General Affairs Office.\u201d It was Chief Zhou. \u201cXiao Dong? Come into my office now.\u201d\u201cYes. I will be right there.\u201d Hah! My opportunity finally comes!Zhou Changchun\u2019s office.Zhou Changchun was laughing happily and pointing to the stock charts on his monitor. \u201cI had just sold off all my shares, and I am going to buy one or two blue chips. But I am not sure which to pick. Give me some of your opinions.\u201d Zhou Changchun did not mention about Daqin Railways shares, and Dong Xuebing was not foolish to talk about that.\u201cSure. But I need to take a look first.\u201d\u201cCome, bring the chair over.\u201d\u201cNo need. I will stand.\u201dThe stock market was doing well in the morning. The top-performing share was new stock. It had risen by about 98.03%. The second to the eighth shares had increased by about 10%. The rest of the shares like Pharmaceutical shares, technology shares, had increased by at least 7%.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Zhou Changchun asked. \u201cWhich shares should I pick?\u201dDong Xuebing used the mouse and clicked on the charts of some shares. \u201cPlease wait a while. Let me analyze these charts.\u201dZhou Changchun slowly sipped on his tea. \u201cNo hurry. Take your time to analyze the shares. Most importantly, the share must be doing well and stable.\u201dThe performing shares had almost reached their peak, and Dong Xuebing looked at the top losers list. The top loser was a company called Hainan Rubber. It had dropped 10.03% and was about to reach the daily limits. Dong Xuebing looked at the chart and scanned through the company\u2019s latest news. This company was listed not long ago, and it was considered an agriculture share. The profits were average despite owning a considerable market share. Basically, this company had not met the expectations of the investors, and the share prices had been dropping since trading starts.Zhou Changchun frowned as he looked at the monitor. He waved his hand: \u201cLook at the next company. It is not advisable to touch those shares that had reached the daily limit. There are so many orders queuing to sell. Tomorrow, this share will surely continue to fall. This company is also not doing well. Look at other shares.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d When Dong Xuebing was about to close the window, Hainan Rubbers share prices start to jump.There was an order to buy 80,000 shares of this company.Soon, another order to buy 20,000 shares came in and canceled out all the orders to sell. The percentage fall of the share prices was reduced to -7.26%.-6.17%\u2026\u2026-5.32%\u2026\u2026-3.78%\u2026\u2026-2.02%\u2026\u2026In a blink of an eye, the share prices had almost breakeven.It was so shockingly fast.Dong Xuebing did not hesitate and said \u201cBACK\u201d in his heart.\u2026\u2026The time returns back to 1 minute ago.Dong Xuebing\u2019s eyes blurred and in front of him was Hainan Rubbers share prices chart.This share was still at the lower side of the daily limits. There were still no signs of this share moving.Zhou Changchun looked at the monitor and said: \u201cLook at the next company. It is not advisable to touch those shares that had reached the daily limit. There are so many orders queuing to sell. Tomorrow, this share will surely continue to fall. This company is also not doing well. Look at other shares.\u201dAfter so many days of training with his extraordinary power, Dong Xuebing was accustomed to this. He immediately points to the monitor: \u201cChief Zhou, hurry and buy this Hainan Rubber shares. It will be rising soon.\u201dZhou Changchun was shocked. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that it is not advisable to touch those shares that had reached the daily limit?\u201dDong Xuebing immediately replied: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will surely rise. I dare not trick you.\u201dZhou Changchun was still hesitating. \u201c\u2026\u2026 How can you tell?\u201d\u201cJust trust me this time. There is not much time left.\u201d Dong Xuebing said anxiously.Because Zhou Changchun did not listen to Dong Xuebing yesterday, he made lesser profits. Now, Dong Xuebing seems very confident that this share will rise. He frowned and thought for about 1 second and said: \u201cFine. I will buy this company\u2019s shares.\u201d Zhou Changchun was using trading software to trade online. His password was saved on his computer, and he could log in and place the trade very fast.After buying the shares, both of them were staring at the monitor in silence.Hainan Rubber share prices remained unchanged. There were sales orders of almost 100,000 shares in the queue.Zhou Changchun looked at the monitor and tapped on his teacup. He was tapping faster and faster.Rise!Hurry up and rise!Dong Xuebing also clenches his fist nervously.1 second\u2026\u20262 seconds\u2026\u2026Suddenly, a big order to buy the shares appeared on the monitor.Followed by 20,000 shares traded.Another 7,000 shares traded.Chief Zhou could see the share prices of Hainan Rubber shooting up like a rocket.Chief Zhou banged the desk excitedly. \u201cIt had gone up. The share price had risen!\u201dDong Xuebing was jumping in joy in his heart. \u201cIt will still go up further.\u201d-7.26%-6.17%\u2026\u2026-5.32%\u2026\u2026Zhou Changchun points at the monitor: \u201cThis is a good share!\u201d-3.78%\u2026\u2026-2.02%\u2026\u2026The share prices kept going up.Zhou Changchun laughed and slapped Dong Xuebing\u2019s back. \u201cHow do you know it will rise?\u201dDong Xuebing made up an excuse: \u201cFrom my analysis of the charts.\u201dZhou Changchun laughed heartily. \u201cGood. You are really capable!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMorning.Dong Xuebing had secretly downloaded a stock market software on his office computer to analyze the stock market.Dong Xuebing also wanted to make some money. But he thought it through. He does not think it was a good idea to trade shares. He does not have the capital, and the current regulations restrict the sales of the shares on the same day. He would have to wait for the next day. Which was also known as T+1. Dong Xuebing\u2019s BACK could only return to 1 minute before. He might be able to know the shares will rise in the next minute, but he could not predict what would happen when the market close. The risk was too high.Just like Hainan Rubber shares. Yes, in 1 minute, the share prices had climbed up from the lowest point and had made Chief Zhou happy. But as when the market was closing, the share prices fell back again. The next day, the prices continued to decline. There were not many profits, and Chief Zhou had almost made losses.The only securities that could be traded on the same day of purchase at T+0 were warrants. But there was only one warrant left \u2013 Changhong CWB1. This warrant was like a dead fish. The prices fell by a few cents every day. There were almost no fluctuations. This was why Dong Xuebing gave up the idea of making money through trading. He only wants to analyze the stock market for Zhou Changchun. Although he might not be able to guarantee to make money for him, at least he could make him happy. This way, he would be closer to his direct supervisor.Dong Xuebing, you must work hard!All these are for your promotion.\u201cHehe, Bing Zhi is so early today.\u201d\u201cGood morning everyone.\u201d\u201cGood morning.\u201dEveryone had slowly arrived at work.Dong Xuebing greeted his colleagues and quickly close the stock market program.Guo Shunjie was the last to arrive in the office. He saw there was some dust on the floor and said: \u201cWhy is the floor dirty again? There is an inspection today.\u201d Because Zhou Changchun had been coming in late these few days because of his health, Guo Panwei could not be bothered with cleaning up the office. It had been Dong Xuebing who was cleaning up. Guo Shunjie walked to his desk and turn to Dong Xuebing: \u201cXiao Dong, go and sweep the floor.\u201dWhy was it me again?Dong Xuebing was not afraid of doing work. Compared to the poverty lifestyle he had been through all these years with his mother, this was nothing.Dong Xuebing could not stand that arrogant look on Guo Shunjie\u2019s face.Dong Xuebing had been bullied by Guo Shunjie again and again. He was almost on the point of breaking.But when Dong Xuebing remembered that he had just joined the agency and Guo Shunjie had someone among the higher-ups backing him, he gritted his teeth and roll up his sleeves. He took the broom and dustpan from behind the door and start to sweep. Dong Xuebing could feel Guo Shunjie\u2019s hostility against him getting stronger these two days. He could also guess the reason. A newcomer had embarrassed him by completing a task he could not complete. Guo Shunjie was jealous.Changjuan and Guo Panwei pretended not to see anything.Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi could not stand it. They stood up and started to help Dong Xuebing sweep the office.Guo Shunjie glanced at the 3 of them and continued to surf some online forums.Dong Xuebing was very tired today. He could feel his back aching as he bends over to sweep a corner. These few days, he had to clean up the whole office and still must complete his daily work. On top of that, Guo Shunjie had also ordered Dong Xuebing to do his tasks for him. He did not have time to rest.\u201cBing Zhi, go and take a break. I can do it.\u201d Zhuang Zhi said.Dong Xuebing stopped massaging his back and forced a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thank you.\u201dTan Limei pointed towards the direction of Guo Sunjie with her chin and whispered: \u201cThat guy cannot tolerate anyone better than him.\u201d Although Tan Limei had a big mouth and likes to gossip, she knows her place well. Just now, when Guo Shunjie was picking on Dong Xuebing, she was pissed, but she did not voice out against Guo Shunjie openly.Guo Shunjie was the senior in the office and still have backings in the agency. It was not wise to offend him.10 minutes later, Dong Xuebing finished sweeping the office and returned to his seat. He was still panting and was about to continue working on a task he could not complete yesterday.But before Dong Xuebing could even stop panting, Guo Shunjie, who was at the water dispenser points to the empty container: \u201cThere is no more water. Xiao Dong, go and carry a bottle in.\u201d Guo Shunjie was not happy with Dong Xuebing for staring at him earlier. His father was close to the District Political Commissar, and even Chief Li Qing and Zhou Changchun had to speak to him politely. Who was this Dong Xuebing to stare at him?Dong Xuebing was furious. \u201cCarry water?\u201d I am ignoring you and yet you are still trying to find trouble with me?Guo Shunjie looked at him coldly: \u201cYes. Bring in a bottle of water for the dispenser.\u201dOld Yan also felt Guo Shunjie was too much. He looked up from his newspaper: \u201cXiao Dong is also tired. You can just give the cleaner Old Wang a call. He is the one who has been topping up the water for the dispenser.\u201d Old Yan was not afraid of offending the District Political Commissar. He had offended a leader who was two ranks about the District Political Commissar before, and he was not afraid of offending one more person.Guo Shunjie replied without facing Old Yan: \u201cOld Wang is cleaning the corridors now. He is not free to top up the water.\u201dDong Xuebing asked: \u201cYou did not even call him. How do you know he is busy?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Guo Shunjie stared at Dong Xuebing. \u201cI cannot ask you to bring in a bottle of water? Do you know the rules here? These jobs are done by newcomers. Are you expecting me and Panwei to go and carry in the water?\u201dChangjuan tried to calm the situation down: \u201cI think Chief Zhou is coming in soon. Stop arguing.\u201dTan Limei look at Guo Shunjie with disgust: \u201cThat right. Is the document which Director Li wants with you? I met him earlier when I was coming in. He says to bring the documents to him as soon as possible.\u201dGuo Shunjie uttered a reply and took a brown envelope from his desk before turning to Dong Xuebing again: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I can\u2019t order you around. No one is allowed to help him. Let him carry the water in himself.\u201d He walked out, and when he passed by Dong Xuebing, he said: \u201cIf the water bottle for the dispenser is not changed when I return, you are dead.\u201d\u201cOk. I will wait for you.\u201d Dong Xuebing could no longer tolerate him. He sneered: \u201cI will not change the water. What can you do to me?\u201dGuo Shunjie replied with a smirk: \u201cFine. Go ahead and try.\u201dBang! Guo Shunjie walked out of the office and slammed the door close.The mood in the office was still tense and before Tan Limei and the rest could say anything, the door opens again.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong with everyone?\u201d Zhou Changchun walked in with his briefcase.Changjuan immediately replies: \u201cNothing. Good morning Chief Zhou.\u201dZhou Changchun nodded and was about to enter his room when he remembered something. \u201cOh, Xiao Dong. Come to my room.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Changchun\u2019s office.Dong Xuebing was still furious when he followed Zhou Changchun into his office. If this were in the past, he would surely complain to Zhou Changchun and let him know the true colors of Guo Shunjie. But now, Dong Xuebing would not do this. He had learned how to matter such matters. If he told the leader about this matter, this matter might also not be solved. The leader would also look down on him for not being able to resolve such a petty issue himself.\u201cXiao Dong, are you unwell?\u201d Zhou Changchun could see something was wrong with Dong Xuebing and asked him out of concern.Dong Xuebing recollected himself. \u201cThank you for your concern. I did not sleep well last night.\u201d\u201cYou must take care of yourself and rest well.\u201d Zhou Changchun sat down. \u201cBring the chair over. Trading is about to start.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately said: \u201cNo need. I will just stand.\u201dZhou Changchun unhappily said: \u201cI am asking you to sit beside me. Stop saying all those things.\u201d\u201cThank you, Chief Zhou.\u201d Dong Xuebing was aware of his posture now. Even this was a small round stool, he also sat down on half his buttocks.Dong Xuebing looked at the o\u2019clock computer screen, and it was 09.50 am. Trade orders were coming in for the stock markets of 2 cities. These orders were competing, and it was still considered unofficial. The more people that buy the shares, the higher the share prices will rise when the market opens.\u201cXiao Dong, how long have you been trading shares?\u201d\u201cAbout 3 to 4 years.\u201d Dong Xuebing lied.\u201cDo you have any tricks or secret techniques? How come you are so confident Hainan Rubber share prices will rise that day?\u201dDong Xuebing wanted to say that he has no secret techniques. But that will make the leader feel that he does not want to share and will hate him for being selfish. So, Dong Xuebing continued to make up stories. \u201cIt is also not considered secret techniques. Look at this chart. This trade volume and this fluctuation mean the probability of this share rising is higher. You still need to look at the candlestick chart, daily average, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and KDJ indicator to analyze the market.\u201dZhou Changchun does not know about this but pretends he knows it all. \u201cGood. You are right. We must analyze all these to understand the market well.\u201d He was feeling good. Although he did not make much money from Hainan Rubber shares, he must admit that Dong Xuebing have a good eye for the stock market. He could only blame himself for being unlucky that the share prices fell the next day again.Market opens.The index rises a little.Zhou Changchun was staring at the monitor. \u201cCome. Help me pick a share.\u201d\u201cI am only confident in the ultra short term trading. The rest\u2026.. errr\u2026\u2026 if the shares did not rise later, you\u2026\u2026\u201dHaha. Ultrashort-term is good enough. Don\u2019t give yourself pressure. Just pick a good share.\u201dDong Xuebing agreed and click on the trading software\u2019s overview. He had discovered this function of the software in the morning. It will indicate the prices of all the shares and the latest trade information. For example, which big player had sold a high volume of shares, which stock had risen. With this overview, Dong Xuebing does not need to look for stocks like a headless chicken.This time, news of a few railway companies had appeared on the smaller overview window in the bottom right corner of the monitor.Daqin Railway \u2013 High volume of shares were sold.Guoheng Railway \u2013 Share prices plungedGuangshen Railway \u2013 High volume of shares were sold.Daqin Railway \u2013 Share prices plunged\u201cThe big boys are selling the shares.\u201d Because Zhou Changchun had bought Daqin Railway shares a few days ago, he monitored this share closely. \u201cRailway shares are done. The past two days, the share prices had increased too high and were overrated. I think it will not be able to recover in the next few months.\u201dDong Xuebing also thinks this way. He continues to look at other shares.Both of them were looking at the pharmaceutical shares when an update appeared on the bottom right corner\u2019s window. Dong Xuebing and Zhou Changchun were shocked by that update.Daqin Railways \u2013 Trading stopped for reaching the higher daily limits.Dong Xuebing thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.A while ago, there were still many trades selling this company\u2019s shares. How come it had reached higher daily limits?BACK!\u2026\u2026Time was returned to one minute ago. Dong Xuebing saw the update \u201cDaqin Railway \u2013 Share prices plunged\u201d in the small window.He immediately clicks on the share\u2019s average graph. The share prices had fallen 0.78%. The share prices did not drop too much. But compared to yesterday, today\u2019s index had increased a lot. But the big boys were starting to sell off their shares, and the share prices had plunged suddenly. From this trend, it might reach the lower daily limit and ordered to stop trading.\u201cThe big boys are selling the shares.\u201d Zhou Changchun smiled. \u201cRailway shares are done. The past two days, the share prices had increased too high and were overrated. I think it will not be able to recover in the next few months.\u201d\u201cChief Zhou.\u201d Dong Xuebing could not wait any longer. \u201cHurry and buy Daqin Railway shares. The share prices will rise soon.\u201dChief Zhou was surprised. \u201cDaqin Railway? Rise? Isn\u2019t it falling now?\u201d\u201cIt should be the big players trying to scare the smaller players to sell their shares.\u201dChief Zhou shook his head. \u201cRailway shares cannot make it. Look, the share prices are still falling.\u201dDong Xuebing quickly said: \u201cTrust me. I can tell from the Ultrashort term that the prices will rise a lot. It\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cErrrr\u2026\u2026\u201d Chief Zhou was still hesitating. But because Dong Xuebing was accurate the previous two times, he moved forward. \u201cFine. I will listen to you.\u201d Zhou Changchun had medical conditions, and his legs were weak. But this stock addict\u2019s hands were very agile. Click, click, click. He typed on the keyboard. As Chief Zhou was not very confident of Daqin Railway shares, he only bought 3,000 shares.Will the share price really rise? Zhou Changchun wonders.Dong Xuebing also could not believe what he saw. After all, the share prices were in the red and had risen to reach higher daily limits and stopped trading. The trade volume must be enormous. But Dong Xuebing did not have to time to see the reason for the rise. So, he could only stare at the monitor now to find out what caused the sudden increase.Huh? Did the overview show the wrong information?Dong Xuebing\u2019s hands turned cold when he thought of this possibility.-0.78%\u2026\u2026-0.92%\u2026\u2026The share prices fell by a few more cents.Dong Xuebing\u2019s palms were all sweaty. Please rise\u2026\u2026Suddenly, a string of numbers appeared, and the colors of the graph changed.Dong Xuebing and Zhou Changchun blinked. They saw a huge trade order to buy Daqin Railway shares coming in, and the share prices became +3.58%.6.42%\u2026\u20268.38%\u2026\u20268.92%\u2026\u20269.37%\u2026\u202610.01%\u2026\u2026The price shot up and reached the daily limit.The shares stopped trading.Zhou Changchun took in a deep breath and slapped his thighs 3 times. \u201cGood, good, good!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After Daqin Railways had reached the daily limit, Dong Xuebing could not predict what would happen next.Half a minute past. Daqin Railway share prices fell slightly to +6.28%.Even though the prices had fallen slightly, Zhou Changchun was still excited. He was impressed with Dong Xuebing\u2019s observation of the ultrashort-term trading. Even those experts on TV could not be compared with Dong Xuebing. Who dares to claim that this share will surely rise? Who dares to guarantee a stock which was plunging will rise? Dong Xuebing had been accurately forecasting these.Zhou Changchun looked at Dong Xuebing, who was sitting beside him. He likes this young man.\u201cCome, drink some water.\u201d Zhou Changchun took out a paper cup and poured a cup of water for Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing stood up and received the cup with both hands. \u201cThank you chief. I will pour myself.\u201dZhou Changchun smiled and patted his shoulders, asking him to sit down. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so courteous with me. From the first day I met you, I know you are exceptional. Hahaha\u2026\u2026 See, I am right! Your skills in predicting the ultrashort-term trend are on a different level.\u201d\u201cThank you for your praises.\u201dDong Xuebing felt these words were not sincere. The first time he met Zhou Changchun, he accidentally addressed him as \u201cDeputy Chief,\u201d and he was frowned upon by him. The other time, it was because of his sitting postures. If he does not have the ability BACK, Zhou Changchun should be giving him a hard time now. Hah, someone exceptional? Who are you trying to fool?This was how it works in government agencies.Still, water runs deep here.The leader had helped him poured water, and he must finish it. After drinking the cup of water, Dong Xuebing said: \u201cChief Zhou, I will go back to work now?\u201dZhou Changchun nodded. \u201cLet me know immediately if you encounter any issues at work.\u201dEveryone in the office looks at him when he walks out of the room. Dong Xuebing remembered that Guo Shunjie had ordered him to do something and his anger rise again. He looked around the office. Guo Shunjie had not returned back to the office. So, he returned to his sit and continued with his work.Since both of them had fallen out, Dong Xuebing decided to ignore him.Zhuang Zhi wanted to say something to Dong Xuebing but changed his mind.Suddenly the door opened, and Guo Shunjie walked in.The General Affairs Office became tense again. Dong Xuebing did not look at him and continued typing on his computer.Guo Shunjie saw the water dispenser was still empty and felt he was being challenged. His face changed, and he walked closer to Dong Xuebing. He pointed at Dong Xuebing and angrily said: \u201cFine. I can\u2019t even order you to carry a bottle of water up? Who do you think you are?\u201dDong Xuebing looked back at him coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s not me. It\u2019s you who thinks you are somebody.\u201dGuo Shunjie grabbed Dong Xuebing\u2019s collar. \u201cI am giving you one more chance. Go and bring up a bottle of water now! You hear me?\u201d He thought Zhou Changchun had not arrived at the office yet and did not control his volume.Old Yan shouted: \u201cGuo Shunjie, you are too much.\u201dTan Limei stole a glance at Chief Zhou\u2019s office and shouted louder than Old Yan. \u201cDon\u2019t fight! Let\u2019s settle this peacefully.\u201dChangjuan and Guo Panwei also did not warn Guo Shunjie that Chief Zhou was in the office. They were sitting at their places as spectators.\u201cSettle peacefully? I had told him nicely earlier.\u201d Guo Shunjie tried to control his anger. \u201cBut he is the one who is disrespecting the seniors in this office.\u201dDong Xuebing knew that Tan Limei and Old Yan had shouted loudly because they wanted to let Chief Zhou know and he could step in to settle this dispute. But Dong Xuebing suddenly had an idea. He replied nicely: \u201cI am busy just now and had no time to do it.\u201dGuo Shunjie saw Dong Xuebing \u201cadmitting defeat\u201d and became more arrogant. \u201cBusy? What are you busy with?\u201dDong Xuebing purposely did not saw Chief Zhou had looked for him and replied. \u201cSomething very important.\u201d\u201cImportant?\u201d Guo Shunjie grabbed his collar more tightly and shouted. \u201cWhat is more important than bring up the water? Huh? I have just finished my work, and I can\u2019t even have a cup of hot tea when I return? You still have the time to do other things? You should put aside all other task and bring up the water first!\u201dA door opens. It was the small office room\u2019s door.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Chief Zhou?\u201d\u201cChief Zhou.\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 you are around?\u201d Guo Shunjie was not panicking. He slowly releases his grip on Dong Xuebing\u2019s collar and retracts his hands. He tried to complain about first. \u201cChief Zhou, this Xiao Dong is too\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Changchun facial expressions were not too good. He stared at Guo Shunjie in the eyes and interrupted him: \u201cI am the one who asked Xiao Dong to do something. Are the things you said for me?\u201dGuo Shunjie was dumbfounded. \u201cAh\u2026.. I\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know about this. I did not\u2026..\u201dZhou Changchun continued: \u201cI want to know which is more important. Is your task more important or mine? Whose tasks is more urgent? Yours or mine? Huh? Xiao Dong have to help you change the water for the dispenser first before he can do the task I assigned to him? Huh? Are you the Chief or am I the Chief?\u201dGuo Shunjie knew that he had said something wrong. He immediately said: \u201cI\u2026.. That\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShouting and grabbing a colleague\u2019s collars during work hours? Are you trying to beat him up? Where do you think this place is? Do you still have any respect for the leaders? Huh?\u201d Zhou Changchun asked with a stern look. His following words were obviously siding with Dong Xuebing. \u201cCan\u2019t you call Old Wang to bring the water? Why must you call Xiao Dong to do it? Did he offend you?\u201dGuo Shunjie was embarrassed, and his face turns red. \u201cNo, I will call Old Wang now.\u201d But no one answers his call. \u201c\u2026\u2026 Old Wang is not around.\u201dChief Zhou continued scolding. \u201cHe is not around, the whole office no need to drink water?\u201dGuo Shunjie had not expected his words would make Zhou Changchun so angry. He immediately replied. \u201cI will go and carry the water up.\u201dGuo Panwei looked at Dong Xuebing in shock. He was puzzled why Chief Zhou would help Dong Xuebing. Seems like he could not order Dong Xuebing around in future.Dong Xuebing immediately says: \u201cChief Zhou, I am also responsible for this. I should have changed the water first.\u201dZhou Changchun waved his hand. \u201cCall Old Wang to do those manual work next time.\u201d Zhou Changchun also felt Guo Shunjie had become more arrogant recently. He wanted to make use of this opportunity to give him a warning. If Guo Shunjie carries on like this, he might not give Zhou Changchun any respect. Although Zhou Changchun had been nice to Guo Shunjie, it was because he respects the Political Commissar. It was not because he was afraid of Guo Shunjie. No leaders will be afraid of their subordinates. Guo Shunjie does not have a direct relationship with the Political Commissar, even if the Political Commissar was his father, he still has to listen to Zhou Changchun in the office. Guo Shunjie must also obey his instructions.Not long later, Guo Shunjie returns with a bottle of water. He was panting when he places the water bottle beside the dispenser. He must have lack exercise and seldom do manual labor. He spent a long time to change the water and still got wet. His expression was really pathetic.Dong Xuebing was laughing in his heart when he saw the pathetic Guo Shunjie. Don\u2019t you like to order people around? How do you feel being ordered around?Old Yan and Changjuan were secretly laughing at him.Tan Limei also showed Dong Xuebing a thumbs up under the table secretly.Most of the people in the office had experienced Guo Shunjie\u2019s arrogance, and everyone was happy to see him getting into trouble. At the same time, every one of them saw a different Dong Xuebing. Chief Zhou seems to value him more recently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMonday.Dong Xuebing was having his breakfast at a shop near his workplace when he saw the General Affairs Office, Chief Li Qing. Li Qing was eating a Xiaolongbao. Dong Xuebing did not dare to sit with his leader on the same table. He greeted Li Qing from far and sat at a nearby table. Although Dong Xuebing had only met Li Qing a few times, because of Deputy Bureau Chief Yang\u2019s speech, Li Qing remembered his name. He finished his breakfast and wiped his mouth with a napkin. \u201cXiao Dong? I heard from Old Zhou about your recent performances. Good. Continue to work hard.\u201d He took out a packet of cigarettes and threw one stick to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing was surprised and replied: \u201cDirector Li, errr\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to smoke.\u201dLi Qing laughed: \u201cWhich man does not know how to smoke? You have to learn.\u201d\u201cThank you, Director Li.\u201dThe leader had spoken, and Dong Xuebing could not refuse. But Li Qing giving him a cigarette made him happy. This was a sign that the leader was willing to be close to him. He borrowed the lighter and lights his cigarettes after a few tries. He carefully took a small puff. Maybe it was because he had inhaled a small puff, he did not choke on the smoke. He only felt some giddiness.Li Qing laughed, patted his shoulders and left for work.After breakfast, Dong Xuebing did not go to work straight. He went to a small store and bought a pack of cigarettes for 10 RMB.Dong Xuebing knows that if he were to survive in the government sector, he had to smoke or give out cigarettes. This was why he bought this packet of cigarettes, Hongtashan. The cigarettes he purchased cannot be too cheap. If he brings a pack of cheap cigarettes with him, others will look down upon him. He could not bring a pack of better cigarettes either. The leaders will see that his cigarettes are better than theirs and might be unhappy. Some petty leaders will think that he was trying to make them look bad.General Affairs Office.Dong Xuebing entered the office and greeted: \u201cGood morning everyone.\u201d\u201cXiao Dong, you are here?\u201d\u201cGood morning.\u201dAlmost everyone was in the office except for Guo Shunjie. When Dong Xuebing was still wondering if that guy was skiving in the toilet again, Tan Limei pouted towards his back and smiled. Dong Xuebing turned around, and the door opened suddenly. He got a shock and saw Guo Shunjie sweeping the back of the door with a broom.Dong Xuebing was laughing in his heart. This guy still knows how to clean up the office?Guo Shunjie stared at Dong Xuebing and said: \u201cWe shall wait and see.\u201d\u201cOka.\u201d Dong Xuebing shrugged his shoulders and returned to his desk.Guo Shunjie was wondering why this Dong Xuebing had been so lucky recently. Even Deputy Chief Zhou was looking out for him. If Zhou Changchun were not looking out for Dong Xuebing, he would not scold Guo Shunjie the other day. To try and reverse Zhou Changchun\u2019s impression of him, he came in earlier to clean up the office. He also did not ask Dong Xuebing to do any task.It was not Guo Shunjie did not want to ask the Political Commissar for help. It was because he could not ask him for help.As a subordinate who was scolded for saying the wrong things by the leader was normal. It\u2019s impossible for the Political Commissar to interfere with such petty issues. Furthermore, Guo Shunjie was not that close with the Political Commissar. The Political Commissar was close to Guo Shunjie\u2019s father and will help to take care of him in the agency. But he will never support him without principles.Guo Shunjie had no choice but to keep low and bear with it. He dares not to look for trouble with Dong Xuebing.Noon.Dong Xuebing, who was in a good mood, looked at the stock markets. A few days ago, he had helped Zhou Changchun picked a company\u2019s share and had risen a lot. He was also tempted to trade himself. But he can\u2019t buy and sell the same day. His BACK was not useful for this. That day, Daqin Railway shares had risen sharply and reached the daily limits, but today, the prices had plunged. Chief Zhou would be lucky if he did not lose any money.Dong Xuebing thought for a long time. Was there really no way to trade?The only thing that could be traded on the same day was that 580027, Changhong CWB1. But the price was always dropping.\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing keyed in the code for Changhong Warrants. He wanted to see it\u2019s recent performance.Dong Xuebing had a shock when he saw Changhong CWB1 warrant price. It was at 0.002 RMB. It had fallen to 0.002 RMB! He immediately searched on the internet and knew that today was the last trading for this warrant. Tomorrow, it will stop trading forever. This was why it had fallen by so much. Based on the past warrants, there were no limits on how much the warrant price will fall or rise on the last day of trading. Most of the warrant prices will drop to 0.001 RMB. Whoever that was unable to sell it, was unlucky.0.01 RMB more will be at it\u2019s lowest price. It will surely not rise again today.Dong Xuebing decided to give up the idea of making money through trading.\u201cEh, Bing Zhi also trade?\u201d Tan Limei saw his screen when she walked past Dong Xuebing\u2019s desk.Dong Xuebing laughed. \u201cNo. I am just taking a look. Trading is too risky.\u201d\u201cWhat shares are you looking at? Huh? Changhong Warrants? How come it had fallen to 0.002 RMB? Is it going to stop trading tomorrow?\u201d Tan Limei knew about the financial markets. \u201cHahaha. I wonder who issued these warrants. They are just trying to con people. Look, no matter if it\u2019s put or call, the warrant prices had plunged to 0.001 RMB. I think no warrants will be issued in the future. Only fools will buy those.\u201d\u201cZhuang Zhi who was listening to their conversations: \u201cThat\u2019s right. You can buy anything except for warrants.\u201dChangjuan also overheard the conversation. \u201cMy husband had bought Magang warrants in the past, and he ends up losing all his money. Listen to Sis advice. Don\u2019t meddle with warrants.\u201dLunchtime was over, and Tan Limei brought a stack of documents to the copier machine.The stock market also resumes trading for about 2 minutes. Dong Xuebing took one more look at Changhong Warrant price. It was still 0.02 RMB, and he closes the software. But the next moment Dong Xuebing was stunned. He stood up from his chair. Damn!0.02 RMB was two cents.It was not 0.002 RMB!Was it real? Did Changhong warrant prices increase by 10 times after trading resumes?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDong Xuebing was in a daze because of the warrant prices for about 1 second.BACK BACK BACK!\u2026\u2026The scenes changed.\u201cTime to start work.\u201d Changjuan was keeping her cosmetics.\u201cIt\u2019s 1 pm. I will go and photocopy some documents.\u201d Tan Limei walked towards the copier machine.Time had returned to the past. Trading had just resume trading.Dong Xuebing took in a deep breath. He had not the time to waste. He quickly looks at Changhong CWB1 warrant prices. It was still at 0.002 RMB. More trade orders were selling the warrants compared to the orders buying. A few million warrants were waiting to be sold. There was no indication that the prices will increase.There\u2019s still enough time\u2026\u2026There\u2019s still enough time\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing quickly click on the trading software. If it were a few months back, he would surely not remember his account\u2019s passwords. He had not to trade shares for a few years. But the past few days, he had been helping Zhou Changchun to choose shares, and he recalled his account\u2019s password. Click, click, click, click. He logged in to his trading account. He looked at his available balance in his account. It was 2.35 RMB.When Dong Xuebing set up this trading account with his mother in the past, he had used his current ICBC bank account. All of Dong Xuebing\u2019s savings and salary were in this bank account. It still has about 2,000 RMB. Click, click, click. He clicked on the fund transfer. 2 seconds later, 2,000 RMB was transferred from his bank account to his trading account.He could buy the warrants now.Dong Xuebing did not hesitate a moment. He used his fastest speed to enter the number of warrants he could buy with his 2,000 RMB. Then, he pressed the confirmed button with his trembling fingers. He looked at the main screen again. A trade at the price of 0.002 RMB was completed. From the numbers, it was his trade. Although it was only 2,000 RMB, the price of Changhong warrants was too low. The number of warrants that was bought with 2,000 RMB was astronomical!Transaction completed.Dong Xuebing was right on time.He sighed in relief. He felt that his heart had never beat so fast in his entire life.Come on. Rise!It was as if the market had heard Dong Xuebing\u2019s prayers. Changhong CWB1\u2019s screen refreshed. There was a super big call order worth 5 million RMB. It had bought all the orders that were selling for 0.003 RMB. A while later, millions of warrants were sold. The prices had changed from 0.002 to 0.004 RMB. It was still increasing.Dong Xuebing clenches his first and stared at the monitor. He was breathing heavily.0.004\u2026\u20260007\u2026\u20260.011\u2026\u2026The prices of Changhong CWB1 warrants was like a rocket.Dong Xuebing was very excited. But he came back to his senses. He knows that it not the time to celebrate yet. He quickly opens the trading window and entered a put order. He was not sure Changhong CWB1 prices will rise until how much. But he knew that it will increase to 0.02 RMB in a while. He wanted to be safe and entered 0.02 RMB as the put price. He does not want to be greedy.0.015\u2026\u20260.017\u2026\u20260.020\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing slapped his thighs. \u201cIt\u2019s sold.\u201d0.021\u2026\u20260.022\u2026\u2026Changhong CWB1 prices paused at 0.022 RMB for a while. Then a lot of put orders came flying in. The volume of warrants traded was huge. The plunged was much faster than the time it rises.0.019\u2026\u20260.017\u2026\u20260.013\u2026\u20260.009\u2026\u20260.007\u2026\u20260.005\u2026\u2026The prices had plunged back to the bottom.Dong Xuebing wiped the sweat on his forehead. He could not describe his feelings. Changhong CWB1 was the last warrant on the stock markets of two cities and today was the last trading day. He thought he had no chance to use BACK to make money from trading. But who knows that Dong Xuebing managed to get a chance to make some money.\u201cXiao Dong, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Old Yan went to the water dispenser to get some water when he saw Dong Xuebing sweating profusely.Tan Limei and Changjuan also turned to look at him.Dong Xuebing immediately minimized the stock market software. \u201cNothing. I just feel a bit hot.\u201d Zhou Changchun dares to trade shares in the office openly, and no ones dare to say anything. But Dong Xuebing could not do the same. He must be mindful of his actions in the office to prevent getting into trouble.At this moment, Zhou Changchun entered the office from outside. \u201cXiao Dong, come in for a while.\u201dDong Xuebing could not look at his trading account anymore. He quickly follows the leader to his office.Hou Changchun had called him to his room to help him pick a share. \u201cDaqin Railways did not perform well today. Luckily, I did not buy a lot of that company\u2019s shares. Help me see which share is good.\u201dDong Xuebing was very careful. He knows that Zhou Changchun would get suspicious if he were to be 100% accurate every time he picks a share. It might be okay once in a while. But his ability BACK might still have other uses. He cannot be using this ability for Zhou Changchun to pick shares. \u201cChief Zhou, recently the market is not doing well. I am not very confident. Why not wait for a few more days?\u201dZhou Changchun looked at him: \u201cYour analysis of the past two trades is quite accurate. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled wearily. \u201cBut in the end, you did not make any money. The market looks bleak. Have you seen the market today? There were almost no shares that were rising. There is nothing I can do.\u201dZhou Changchun thought for a while. He only manages to make a small profit from Hainan Rubbers and Daqin Railways shares. But if he did not manage to sell off the shares, he might be stuck with the shares. \u201cAlready. I think the stock index should reach 3,000 points in a month or two. Let\u2019s wait until then.\u201dDong Xuebing returns to his desk.He secretly opens the trading software in a small window. He can\u2019t wait to see his account balance.After deducting the charges, the account balance was 20,000 RMB.2,000 RMB was multiplied by 10 times within seconds.20,000 RMB! 20,000 RMB! 20,000 RMB!Dong Xuebing was overjoyed. This amount of money might mean nothing for some families. But for Dong Xuebing\u2019s family, it was an enormous amount.In the future, he could call his mother over the phone without worrying about the phone charges. They could afford to eat meat like beef and mutton\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing tears start to well up in his eyes. It\u2019s been 4 years. He and his mother had been living in poverty for too long\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dong Xuebing got to wait for the next day to transfer his money into his bank account. Zhou Changchun had gone to the hospital for his follow up and was not in office. Dong Xuebing took the opportunity to leave the for lunch earlier and went to ICBC bank to transfer 3,000 RMB to his mother\u2019s account. He wanted his mother to have a better life.After transferring the money. Dong Xuebing called his mother on his mobile phone.Ring, ring, ring. A woman answered the phone. \u201cHello, Hui Tian Secondary school.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cHi, I am looking for Luan Xiaoping.\u201d\u201cYou are looking for Teacher Luan? Please hold the line.\u201d The woman was silent for a while before shouting: \u201cTeacher Luan, you have a phone call. It might be your son.\u201dA few seconds later, Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother answered the phone. \u201cXuebing?\u201dDong Xuebing sat down on a blue plastic chair in ICBC bank\u2019s waiting area. \u201cMum, are you having lunch now? I have just gotten my pay and have just transferred 3,000 RMB to you. If you are free go and withdraw it from the bank. The weather has turn cold recently. Buy a coat or something. Just treat it as a gift from me.\u201d His mother had lost a lot of money in the stock market in the past. Dong Xuebing knows that if he told his mother that he had made money from trading, his mother would surely be worried. He also can\u2019t explain his special ability BACK to her. So, he decided to keep it from her.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother grumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t need your money. I still have money with me. You should keep it for yourself.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cThe money has been transferred. Stop nagging at me.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother sighed. \u201cThen\u2026\u2026 okay. But next time don\u2019t send me any money. My salary is still enough for me. You should save your money. These few years we are poor, and I don\u2019t even have money to buy you new clothes. You have already started working in the government. You must give others a good impression. Throw those patched and torn clothes away and buy some new ones.\u201dDong Xuebing looked down at his clothes. He was wearing a faded T-shirt. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 Then I will go and buy some new clothes tonight.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s mother wanted to save on the phone charges and she just ask Dong Xuebing briefly about his work before hanging up.Evening, after work.On the bus back home, Dong Xuebing send Qu Yunxuan a message. \u201cAre you working overtime today? I will prepare dinner and wait for you to return?\u201d After sending the message, Dong Xuebing felt blissful. How come this message feels like a couple sending to each other. Beep, beep. He was still day dreaming when Qu Yunxuan replied. \u201cDon\u2019t. Wait for me to return home and I will cook for you. Oh, there is no more vegetables at home. I don\u2019t know what you want to eat. How about you come over to my workplace to fetch me? It is almost time for me to get off work. We can go to the nearby market to buy some vegetables.\u201d Dong Xuebing looked at the message and replied: \u201cOkay.\u201dBeijing 2nd Ring RoadBeijing Daily (Newspaper) HeadquartersAlthough Dong Xuebing and Aunt Xuan were close these few years, but their relationship were only normal neighbors. But after Dong Xuebing saved her life a few months back, they became closer and Dong Xuebing knew more about her. Qu Yunxuan had started a business with some friends after she graduated from University but the company closed down not long after. She then got a job with Beijing Daily\u2019s advertising division. She was now a team leader there.10 minutes later. People starts to walk out of the building.The was the first time Dong Xuebing came to Qu Yunxuan\u2019s work place. He also did not know which exit she will walk out from. He just stood there looking at the crowd trying to spot her.Suddenly, Dong Xuebing saw Qu Yunxuan walking out from an office building not far away. Her hair was tied up in a bun and was wearing a white blouse, brown office skirt, stockings and black high heels. She was beautiful and Dong Xuebing was mesmerised by her again. How come Aunt Xuan was so beautiful? Dong Xuebing wondered.\u201cSee you tomorrow, Team Leader Qu.\u201d\u201cBye. See you tomorrow.\u201d Qu Yunxuan nodded.\u201cSister Qu, is the proposal which I told you yesterday ready?\u201dQu Yunxuan turned to that person: \u201cOh, Xiao Lu had completed it. You can talk to him tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOk. Take care. Bye.\u201dQu Yunxuan have the aura of a career woman. This was Dong Xuebing\u2019s first time seeing the other side of her.Qu Yunxuan saw Dong Xuebing and she walked quickly towards him. \u201cHave you waited long? There is a waiting area inside. Why didn\u2019t you go in and wait for me there?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s eyes stop wondering around and said: \u201cI am lazy to register.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed and pointed to a direction. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the market and buy the food you want to eat.\u201dWhile they were crossing the road, Dong Xuebing noticed Qu Yunxuan rubbing her shoulders and he asked: \u201cAre you tired? You want me to help you carry your handbag?\u201dQu Yunxuan brought him to a market: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I am getting paid to do work and I should be tired. When I started my own business, it was more tiring than now. Not only it was physically tiring, it was also mentally tiring.\u201d In front of the market store, Qu Yunxuan changed from being a career woman to a housewife. \u201cHow much is your eggs? 4 RMB for 3? Then give me 1 Kg\u2026\u2026. How much is your chicken wings? Oh\u2026\u2026 give me some of it\u2026\u2026\u201d Qu Yunxuan bought the ingredients and then carry on the conversation with Dong Xuebing. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity. I was young back then and didn\u2019t know a lot of things. If I have a company now, I am sure I will manage it better.\u201d\u201cAre you still thinking of setting up your own business?\u201d\u201cYes. But I do not have the capital now. Let me save up for a few years first.\u201dDong Xuebing noticed that the both of them had similar goals. He wants to be a top official and she wants to make lots of money.North Heping Street.Dong Xuebing wanted to help Qu Yunxuan with the cooking. He was embarrassed for having her to cook for him every time. But Qu Yunxuan chased him out of her house. She asked him to go back to have a shower first and change before dinner.Unit 302, Qu Yunxuan\u2019s house.After blowing his hair dry, Dong Xuebing rang the doorbell of Qu Yunxuan\u2019s unit. The door opened, and he could smell the fragrance of beer chicken wings. He took in a deep breath and walked into the apartment. \u201cWow, it smells nice. Is the rice ready?\u201d There were a few pipping hot dishes on the dinning table. Just looking at the food on the table made Dong Xuebing hungry. He rolled up his sleeves and wanted to start eating.Qu Yunxuan slapped the back of his hand playfully. \u201cWash your hands before you eat.\u201dDong Xuebing retorted: \u201cI had just taken a shower.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to use your hand to knock on the door? You don\u2019t need to touch the door knob when you open the door?\u201d Qu Yunxuan poked his head. \u201cGo and wash your hands now.\u201dDong Xuebing rubbed his nose and walked into the kitchen.Qu Yunxuan, who was still wearing an apron, laughed. \u201cWhen you come out, bring two pairs of chopsticks.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAunt Xuan was great at cooking. She could be the head chef of any 5 stars restaurants. Dong Xuebing ate until his belly could not hold anymore food. He burb and rubbed his bulging tummy on the sofa. Qu Yunxuan was clearing up the dishes like a housewife. He felt he was really lucky and really wanted this feeling to last forever.Whoever marries Aunt Xuan will definitely have a blissful life.Dong Xuebing was looking at Qu Yunxuan\u2019s beautiful white thighs while she was cleaning the dishes in the kitchen. He was fantasizing about those legs when he realized the pair of legs coming closer and closer to him. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Qu Yunxuan was standing in front of him.Dong Xuebing quickly look away. \u201cErmmm\u2026.. I had just gotten my salary. I wonder if you can accompany me to buy a few new clothes.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed and playfully pinched his cheeks. \u201cOkay. Your Aunt here will help you choose some nice clothes and turn you into a handsome young man.\u201dDong Xuebing replied shyly. \u201cStop making fun of me. With my looks, no matter what I wear will also not be good looking.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201d Qu Yunxuan slapped his head lightly. \u201cI say you are handsome means you are handsome. Come, let\u2019s go to the mall.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a bit chilly.Many people were walking in and out of the mall. Qu Yunxuan was wearing heels, and she almost fell when she tried to avoid a woman carrying a child. She grabbed onto Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm. She continued to hold on to Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm into the mall. Dong Xuebing was nervous. Aunt Xuan was holding on to him. He looked at her holding on to his arm and secretly peeped at her chest.The first floor was mostly selling cosmetics and perfumes. The place was filled with sweet scent.Both of them went upstairs and stop by the section selling men\u2019s apparels.Qu Yunxuan squeezed Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm. \u201cXiao Bing, Aunt suggest that you should buy a suit. You will leave a good impression with your leaders.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. \u201cOkay. I will listen to you.\u201d Having a beauty like Aunt Xuan shopping with him was more important than buying anything.A sales assistant walked over to serve them. She got a surprised look on her face when she saw Qu Yunxuan. Qu Yunxuan was too beautiful. \u201cHi, what sort of suit are you looking for?\u201d Dong Xuebing noticed that the nearby sales assistants and customers were looking at their direction. They were all looking at Qu Yunxuan.Qu Yunxuan started to choose the clothes for Dong Xuebing. \u201cDo you have anything more casual?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The sales assistant pointed to the back. \u201cOver here please.\u201dQu Yunxuan immediately spotted a beautiful design. \u201cThis shirt is not bad. Xiao Bing, come over here.\u201d She picked up the shirt and place it in front of Dong Xuebing. \u201cHmmm\u2026. Quite nice.\u201dThe sales assistant smiled: \u201cYes. I think this shirt suits your friend.\u201dYour friend?Dong Xuebing was very sensitive to this word. In Beijing, people will associate \u201cfriend\u201d as being in a relationship. For example, if Dong Xuebing were to introduce his girlfriend to others, he will say \u201cThis is my friend.\u201d It meant his girlfriend. It was the same as the others. For instances, \u201cOh, I heard that Xuebing have a new friend.\u201dDong Xuebing starts to imagine things.Suit, leather shoes, belt.Long sleeve shirt, long pants, sports attire.Dong Xuebing had bought a set of new presentable clothes selected by Qu Yunxuan. Of course, the whole set was not cheap.Dong Xuebing saw the sales assistant packing all the clothes and shoes, he took out his wallet. \u201cWhere is the cashier?\u201dQu Yunxuan tugged his arm and laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I have already paid when you are trying the clothes.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Dong Xuebing gasped in surprised. \u201cAunt Xuan, how can you pay for me? No. How much do all these cost? I will return you the money.\u201d Aunt Xuan had been taking care of him by washing his clothes and cooking for him. He was still thinking of getting her a gift since he had the money now. Instead, she bought the clothes for him.Qu Yunxuan lifted her fist and said with a straight face: \u201cIf you say one more word, I will hit you. Let\u2019s go.\u201dDong Xuebing shut his mouth unwillingly and carried all the shopping bags. He followed Qu Yunxuan out of the mall. He was still feeling bad for letting her pay for the clothes. Oh yes. It was time to change the handphone. The battery life was getting shorter and shorter, and the buttons were not responding. This type of imitation phones was also quite embarrassing. Aunt Xuan was also using an old Nokia phone for almost 3 years. Yes. I will buy her a new phone too.\u201cAunt Xuan. I am thinking of changing my handphone. Shall we go to the Electronic Mall to have a look?\u201d\u201cOkay. There is a Suning not far ahead. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThe skies turned dark, and stars appeared.200 meters away, Suning Electronics.It was almost National Day, and there were lots of people in the shop. The carpark in front of the shop was fully parked. The moment they stepped into the store, they saw rows of counters selling computers and handphones. Around the corner, it was the home appliances section. It was also full of people. It seems that there was a promotion before the National Day.Qu Yunxuan helped Dong Xuebing to carry 3 bags. \u201cWhat brand of handphone are you buying?\u201dDong Xuebing does not mind about the brand of handphone. He was more concern which brand of phone Qu Yunxuan likes. \u201cWhat brand do you think is good?\u201d\u201cNokia, Sony, Motorola, are all good brands.\u201dAfter walking one round in the handphone section of the mall, Dong Xuebing saw iPhone 4 advertisement on a lightbox. This was the latest model of Apple phone. A while before, it had been out of stock. Apple fans had queue up since 4 am to buy this phone. Dong Xuebing had also heard Qu Yunxuan talking about this phone. She was also an iPhone fan. But because it was too expensive, she could only envy others.Dong Xuebing said. \u201ciPhone 4 seems to be very popular.\u201d\u201cOf course. The design and specs are outstanding. But it was too expensive.\u201d\u201cYou think it is nice?\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s nice. If not, why would so many buy it? I remember when iPhone 4 was launched in China, the prices had reached more than 10,000 RMB per phone. Now, the prices had fallen. It is also about 6,000 RMB. Haha. I just think that this phone is pretty. Wait for the launch of iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 prices will drop further. I will buy one then. I cannot afford it now.\u201dDong Xuebing made his decision in his heart. \u201cGo over and take a look?\u201d\u201cOkay. Taking a look will also not cost money. Hahaha.\u201d Qu Yunxuan really likes this phone. She stood in front of the counter and stared at the iPhone 4 on display. She even asked the staff to show her a display set.The staff was a young girl who was good with her words. \u201cSister, iPhone 4 currently has two colors. White and black. We are having a promotion for our black color model. 16G for only 5,580 RMB. You are so pretty, and this iPhone 4 really suits you.\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at the display set and did not say a word.\u201cIf you buy now, we will give you a screen protector and a leather casing. Also\u2026\u2026\u201d The sales girl could tell that Qu Yunxuan really likes this phone and starts to recommend.Qu Yunxuan was hesitating. She seems to be thinking about something. But she looked at the price tag again and shook her head.Dong Xuebing stepped forward and said: \u201cOkay. Give us 1 set\u2026\u2026. No\u2026.. 2 sets.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She immediately smiled and said: \u201cPlease wait a while.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Qu Yunxuan was stunned and then gave Dong Xuebing a slap on the back of his head. \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s costly.\u201dDong Xuebing rubbed his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you like it. I had never given you any gifts before. Now I have some money, just let me give you something.\u201d\u201cYou are buying this phone for me? I don\u2019t want it. You have just started work, and you should not be spending your money like this.\u201d Qu Yunxuan turned to the sales assistant. \u201cSorry, we don\u2019t want it.\u201dDong Xuebing ignored her and said: \u201cWe want. Please issue the receipt.\u201dQu Yunxuan raised her hand in anger. \u201cI will hit you.\u201d\u201cEven if you knock me out, I will also buy this iPhone 4 for you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Qu Yunxuan turned her head around and ignore Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing chose the color of the phone, the screen protector and also the leather casing. After making the payments, the sales assistant took out the iPhones to do the setup. Dong Xuebing thought buying a phone was a quick and easy thing. All he needs to do was to pay for it. Apple phones need a different size sim card, put on the screen protector and register online. It was very troublesome.After a while, the sales assistant smiled to Qu Yunxuan: \u201ciPhone\u2019s sim card is different from our phones. Can you give me your sim card? I need to cut it smaller.\u201dQu Yunxuan kept quiet.Dong Xuebing smiled and touched Qu Yunxuan\u2019s elbow. \u201cWhy are you behaving like this?\u201dQu Yunxuan continued to ignore him.Dong Xuebing rolled his eyes. \u201cI have already paid for it, and there are no refunds. If you really don\u2019t want it, I will give it to someone else.\u201dQu Yunxuan glanced at him and gave him a knock on his head. \u201cYou are wasting your money.\u201d She paused for a while and then took out her handphone slowly from her handbag. She took out the sim card and pass it to the sales assistant. \u201cDo you have other colors for the leather casing? Can I take a look? Hmmm\u2026\u2026 This is nicer. Yes, we will take this\u2026\u2026 Oh, do you have movies and songs here\u2026\u2026 help us store it in the phones too\u2026\u2026 yes\u2026\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u2026\u201dHalf an hour later, Qu Yunxuan was playing with her iPhone 4. She really likes it.Dong Xuebing smiled happily: \u201cAunt Xuan, this iPhone 4 looks nicer when you are holding it in your hands. I think Apple should get you to endorse their phones.\u201d If it were the past Dong Xuebing who was still in University, he would never say such things. But after working for the government, he learned how to speak pleasant words to others.Qu Yunxuan laughed and rolled her eyes. \u201cNo more next time.\u201d She casually wrapped her hand around Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm. \u201cOur Xiao Bing had grown up and can earn money. He also knows how to buy gifts for others. Hahaha\u2026\u2026 When our Xiao Bing becomes a great leader, I will also be proud.\u201dShe was holding on to Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm, and Dong Xuebing was nervous.This was the first time a girl was holding onto his arms.At about 9 pm, Dong Xuebing and Qu Yunxuan reached home, and they placed the shopping bags on the coffee table.Qu Yunxuan sat on Dong Xuebing\u2019s home sofa and played with her new phone. \u201cThe shop was closing just now and could not find the songs I wanted. Xiao Bing, tomorrow help me download some songs from the internet. I want to use it as my ringtone.\u201d She stood up and used her phone to take some selfies. She showed her pictures to Dong Xuebing and asked. \u201cHow is it?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled: \u201cNo matter how you take the pictures, it will also turn out beautiful.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed. \u201cYou really know how to cheer me up.\u201d\u201cI am telling you the truth. No matter if it is a 300,000 pixels camera or a 5 million pixels camera, you will still look pretty.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201d Qu Yuxuan rolled her eyes and pulled Dong Xuebing closer to her on the sofa. She wrapped her arm around Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm and lifted the phone higher to take a selfie. \u201cSmile when you are taking pictures with me.\u201dDong Xuebing could feel his arm pressing against Qu Yunxuan\u2019s breast. He forced a smile, and it looks weird.After the picture was taken, Qu Yunxuan laughed. \u201cWhat is wrong with this expression? You look stupid.\u201dDong Xuebing blushed and thought to himself. You are pressing against me and how can I not be nervous?After playing with the phone for a while, Qu Yunxuan kept phone and start to pack the newly bought clothes. She packed the clothes int Dong Xuebing\u2019s closet and cut those patched and faded clothes into small pieces of clothes. \u201cIt is a waste to throw these clothes away. I will cut them into small pieces, and you can use them as rags to wipe the tables.\u201d Qu Yunxuan monthly salary was not low, but she was a thrifty person.This was also why Dong Xuebing was attracted to her. He looked at Qu Yunxuan and stuttered: \u201cAunt Xuan\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026 I like\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Yunxuan shook the rag in her hands and turned around: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI like\u2026\u2026 like\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing was sweating. But he could not say the full sentence. Qu Yunxuan was the prettiest woman he ever met in his life. She had a good figure, kind-hearted, a good career, etc. She does not have anything bad about her. Dong Xuebing really wanted to take her as his bride and wanted to confess to her. But their relationship had just evolved from being good neighbors to close friends. If he confessed to her, she might feel uncomfortable and, in the future, they might no longer be as close as now. This was not something Dong Xuebing wanted to see.Dong Xuebing remembered that he still had not used BACK today.If Qu Yunxuan rejects him, he can still use BACK to turn back the time. This way, both of them will not feel awkward.That\u2019s right. This should do it.\u201cWhat did you say? Wash (Wash and like sound similar in Chinese)?\u201d Qu Yunxuan laughed. \u201cYou have dirty laundries to wash?\u201d Why are you stuttering and so shy?\u201dQu Yunxuan ignored him and walked to the washroom to pick up Dong Xuebing\u2019s dirty socks and underwear. \u201cOk. Leave these to me. Is there anything else you need me to help you wash?\u201dDong Xuebing wanted to bury his head in a hole on the ground. He rushed forward and tried to take back his socks and underwear. \u201cI can wash these myself.\u201d\u201cGo away.\u201d Qu Yunxuan moved her shoulders to avoid Dong Xuebing. But she shouted \u201couch\u201d when she moved her shoulders. \u201cStop trying to snatch these clothes. My neck hurts.\u201dDong Xuebing panicked. \u201cAre you okay? I\u2019m sorry. I did not hurt you on purpose.\u201dQu Yunxuan sat down and massage her neck: \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I have been having neck pains for a while.\u201dDong Xuebing felt guilty. \u201cLet me help you massage your neck.\u201d\u201cNo need. It should get better after a good night sleep.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing replied. \u201cGo and lie down in the room. I will massage you.\u201dQu Yunxuan hesitated and agreed. \u201cHahaha\u2026. Ok.\u201dDong Xuebing took in a deep breath and readied himself to confess to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She took the pillow and put it under her chin before lying face down on the bed comfortably. Dong Xuebing also took off his slippers and kneel beside her on the bed. He gently placed his hands on her shoulders and start his massage. \u201cNeck is very important. You must take care of it. When you are working, you must not stay in the same position for too long. You have to move about once in a while. Is this strength okay?\u201dQu Yunxuan\u2019s head was buried in the pillow and uttered a reply: \u201cIt\u2019s good. Thank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u201cI said it is not your fault. Ah\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s the aching spot. Softer.\u201dDong Xuebing reduced his strength and continued to massage that spot. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Okay.\u2026..\u201dDong Xuebing was organizing his words in his mind on how to confess to Qu Yunxuan while massaging. At the same time, his eyes were wondering about Qu Yunxuan\u2019s body. Qu Yunxuan was facing down and will not know where he was looking. So, Dong Xuebing looked at the back of her ears, neck, back, waist, bums, legs\u2026\u2026. Qu Yunxuan does not only look beautiful from the front. Even her back view was pretty.\u201cAre you tired? Do you want to rest?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I will massage your back too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You should be tired from working all day. You should rest early.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The muscles in your neck and back are linked. I will have you relax your back muscle.\u201d Dong Xuebing was memorized by her beautiful back and does not want to stop touching her. He enjoys the feeling of rubbing her back. He slowly moved his hands from her shoulders to her back.Qu Yunxuan was also enjoying the massage. She was making some sounds from the relaxing massage.Dong Xuebing could not control himself and suddenly said: \u201cAunt Xuan\u2026\u2026. I love you.\u201dAh\u2026. I finally said it.Qu Yunxuan\u2019s body stiffed and did not say a word.Dong Xuebing could not see her facial expression. He continued: \u201cA few years ago when my mum and I shifted here, I had secretly admired you. It\u2019s true. I\u2026\u2026 I am not good with words and don\u2019t know how to express my feelings well. I just want you to know that I really, really, like you. Aunt Xuan\u2026\u2026. Errrrr\u2026\u2026 Can you be my girlfriend?\u201dQu Yunxuan continued to keep quiet.The silence was torture to Dong Xuebing. His face was all red.After a while, Qu Yunxuann sat up and looked at him. \u201cXiao Bing, I\u2019m sorry. I always see you as my younger brother.\u201dDamn. Rejected. Dong Xuebing felt disappointed. But he knew his place and was already prepared to be rejected. It would be a miracle if Qu Yunxuan accepted him now. Dong Xuebing wanted to know the reason why she rejected him. \u201cAunt Xuan, don\u2019t use brother as an excuse to reject me. I really want to know what I am lacking. Is it my looks? Ok. I do not look good enough to be with you\u2026\u2026\u201d Penniless and no good looks. These were the things that caused Dong Xuebing\u2019s lack of self-esteem.Qu Yunxuan interrupted him. \u201cI am not that shallow. It is not about your looks.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d Dong Xuebing asked. \u201cThen what is it?\u201dQu Yunxuan did not look at him and faced the direction of the window. She said apologetically: \u201cI only feel that you are not my type. How should I put it? Looks are given by God. No one can do anything with it. But you can make up the lack of looks with other things. Maybe it\u2019s our thinking. I know these are some of your habits. But I can only accept clean and tidy men. I cannot accept men with long fingernails. My boyfriend must be cleanly shaved, and his hair must be tidy. It is now about his looks.\u201dIn the past, Dong Xuebing had given up on himself. He did not take care of himself and did not cut his nails, shave or combed his hair.Damn. Points were deducted from all these minor details?BACK!\u2026\u2026The scene changed.Qu Yunxuan face was in front of him with a confused expression. \u201cWhat?\u201dDong Xuebing battered his eyes and asked. \u201cErrr\u2026. What was I saying?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Qu Yunxuan replied. \u201cYou just called my name. What do you want to tell me?\u201dDong Xuebing was relieved. He immediately smiled: \u201cNothing\u2026 I only want to ask if I am pressing too hard.\u201d Lucky. A bit more, it will be more than 1 minute.\u201cHahaha, it is just right. Our Xiao Bing is also good at massage.\u201dDong Xuebing wanted to massage Qu Yunxuan a while more. But he saw his fingernails on her back, and he instinctively retracts his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s all for now. You have some water and rest for a while. We will continue later. I will go and take a shower first.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed at him. \u201cGo. Oh, wear that suit for me to see.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dDong Xuebing rushed out of the room with one hand covering the stubbles. He took the newly bought suit and went into the bathroom. He switched on the lights, closed the door and grabbed his shaver to shave. He then uses a nail clipper to cut all his nails short before taking a quick shower. He combed and used a hairdryer to style his hair neatly.Ok. All done.Dong Xuebing looked at himself in the mirror. He had a clean and tidy look. He walked out of the bathroom after changing into his suit.Qu Yunxuan was playing with her iPhone 4 again in the living room. \u201cWhy did you change in the bathroom? I came out of the room was for you to change in there\u2026\u2026 Eh?\u201d She paused when she saw Dong Xuebing. She was surprised. \u201cWhen did you shave? Your hair\u2026\u2026\u201d She did not notice Dong Xuebing\u2019s suit first. Instead, she noticed his stubbles and hair. So, it\u2019s true. She likes men who look clean and tidy. She was not lying just now. It was all these small details that will attract her.Dong Xuebing was overjoyed. \u201cMy shaver was spoilt and can\u2019t shave properly. It is the same for my hairdryer and nail clippers. I had bought new ones when I got my salary. In the future, I will not be so untidy. I can\u2019t stand being so untidy. I like to look clean and tidy.\u201d He lifted both his hands and showed his clean nails.Qu Yunxuan nodded and stepped forward to straighten his collar. \u201cI still thought you don\u2019t like to cut your nails and shave. So, it was because your shaver and nail clippers are spoilt. You look so much better now\u2026.\u201d Qu Yunxuan looked at him from head to toes and smiled. \u201cHandsome\u2026\u2026\u201dHahaha, I had successfully left a good impression with Aunt Xuan!Dong Xuanbing was thinking of confessing to Aunt Xuan again.He hopes he will succeed the next time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He greeted the old guard at the guard house and before walking into the compound.Only Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi were in the General Affairs Office. When Tan Limei saw Dong Xuebing, she gasped in surprise. \u201cBing Zhi looks so mature today. So handsome.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cI do not have many nice clothes like you. You are dressed up so pretty every day.\u201dTan Limei laughed happily. \u201cYou are so good at praising others.\u201d There was no one else in the office, and Tan Limei playfully patted Zhuang Zhi\u2019s tummy. \u201cHey, you should learn from Bing Zhi. Look at him. He had just joined our office and had gotten the trust of Chief Zhou. If this carries on, he should be replacing Zhou Panwei position in Chief Zhou\u2019s heart. Look at you. You are not good with words. How can you leave a good impression with the leaders?\u201dZhuang Zhi scratched the back of his head: \u201cI\u2026\u2026 I cannot speak well.\u201dDong Xuebing looked at Tan Limei. \u201cTan Zhi, why do you care so much about Zhuang Zhi?\u201dTan Limei blushed. \u201cWho do I care about so much? Hmph! It\u2019s my turn to clean the office today.\u201dZhuang Zhi quickly stood up. \u201cI will help you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d Tan Limei passed the mop to him.Was Dong Xuebing good with words? Knows how to make the leaders like him? This was impossible if it was in the past. He was a quiet person since middle school to university. He could not speak well and get along with others. But after he set his goal, he felt he had changed a lot. He forced himself to say things that will please others. He did it for his promotions.He needs to be humble and modest first before he could get promoted.10 minutes later, all the staffs arrived in office.Dong Xuebing felt his phone vibrates. He took out his iPhone 4 to take a look. It was Qu Yunxuan who had messaged him. \u201cMy boss just gave out an instruction. I need to work overtime today. I might not reach home until after 8 pm. You get dinner yourself.\u201d Dong Xuebing replied. \u201cOk. Be careful when you are coming home.\u201d After sending the message, he was about to keep his phone back into his pocket when a dark figure appeared beside him and snatched his phone away.It was Tan Limei who snatched his phone.\u201cWow!\u201d Tan Limei shouted in surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s iPhone 4. Bing Zhi, you bought this iPhone 4?\u201dGuo Shunjie who was looking at his monitor snorted loudly and did not say a word.Guo Panwei who did not keep up with the latest trend asked: \u201cWhat is iPhone 4?\u201dChangjuan explained: \u201cIt\u2019s a handphone model. It is the hottest handphone now. I heard that it cost 5,000 to 6,000 RMB with the accessories. Hehe, Xiao Dong, you are really willing to buy.\u201dGuo Panwei exclaimed: \u201cHow much? 5,000 to 6,000 RMB for a handphone?\u201d Civil servants\u2019 salary was not a lot when compared to those private companies. He felt that 5,000 to 6,000 RMB was too expensive even to buy a PC, let alone a handphone.Tan Limei looked at the phone in her hands with envy. \u201cThis phone is so pretty. I must also get one when I get this month\u2019s salary. Huh? I can\u2019t afford it even with this month\u2019s salary. I can only wait for next month.\u201d She said and looked at the phone before pleading with Dong Xuebing. \u201cBing Zhi, we are good friends. Can we exchange our phones for a few days? Let me play with it for a few days please\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am ok with it. But your phone\u2019s sim card is different from iPhone.\u201dTan Limei slapped her forehead. \u201cAh\u2026. I forgot about that. Here, have your phone back.\u201d She gave the phone back to Dong Xuebing unwillingly. Tan Limei likes to follow the latest trends. She kept stealing glances at Dong Xuebing\u2019s desk while working and kept borrowing his phone to play around once she was free.There was a meeting in the morning at the small meeting room upstairs. Chief Li Qing was not around, and it was Chief Zhou who chaired the meeting. The meetings in the government sector were all the same. It was not for the department heads to talk about their staffs\u2019 performance. It was to discuss the documents given to them by their higher-ups. Dong Xuebing felt this was meaningless but forced himself to listen to Zhou Changchun\u2019s \u201cchanting\u201d while thinking of how to get promoted.10 minutes\u2026\u202620 minutes\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing was falling asleep and controlling himself from yawning.The people from the General Affairs Office were used to this. Other than Old Yan was doing his own things, the rest were trying their best to pay attention.\u201cThat\u2019s all for today.\u201d Zhou Changchun drank his tea and cleared his throat. \u201cTwo of you will follow me. The rest return to the office. There is a lot of work this morning. Do your best.\u201d Zhou Changchun looked around the meeting room thinking who to pick to follow him out for some errands.Dong Xuebing and Guo Panwei puffed out their chest and straighten their backs.Then Zhou Changchun said. \u201cPanwei, Shunjie, both of you follow me.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Guo Panwei replied immediately and proudly looked at Dong Xuebing. It was as if he was telling Dong Xuebing that did you see it? Even if you have some credits, Chief Zhou still trusts me more than you. Guo Panwei was had been upset with Dong Xuebing immediately felt better.Guo Shunjie did not expect Zhou Changchun would call his name. He brightens up. This means the leader had forgotten about the incident that day. He also looked at Dong Xuebing who had been trying to be closer to Chief Zhou recently. He was delighted to see Chief Zhou not calling Dong Xuebing. Dong Xuebing was still a newbie.\u201cOh yes.\u201d When everyone was walking out of the meeting room, Zhou Changchun suddenly said: \u201cThere will be two very important documents which will be sent to Chief Li Qing there. Two of you must go and collect it and send it to the confidential department. Nothing must go wrong\u2026. Errr\u2026..\u201dDong Xuebing puffed up his chest and had a \u201cleave this to me\u201d expression on his face.After hesitating for a while, Zhou Changchun looked at Dong Xuebing for a second and said: \u201cXiao Chang and Xiao Tan, both of you will do this. The Confidential Department might be having a meeting this morning. If there is no one to collect the documents, don\u2019t bring the documents back to the office. Return it back to Chief Li Qing. There are no duplicates for these documents. Nothing must happen to the documents.\u201d\u201cRest assure Chief.\u201d Tan Limei and Changjuan nodded.Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie looked at Dong Xuebing. There were laughing at him in their hearts.Dong Xuebing felt helpless. After all, he was still new in the office. Zhou Changchun had only started to trust him. But compared to the rest of the staffs, he still trusts the seniors more. Especially Guo Shunjie who was Zhou Changchun\u2019s, right-hand man.Sighed\u2026\u2026. It will be a long journey\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tan Limei and Changjuan also went upstairs to collect the two very important documents from Li Qing\u2019s office. But there was no one at the Confidential Department to receive the documents. It seems that they were still having a meeting. There was only two staff on duty at the counter. But these documents need the leader to acknowledge and signature. Tan Limei and Changjun could only bring the documents back to Director Li Qing.Dong Xuebing was looking at the attendance sheet when they returned. He asked: \u201cYou delivered the documents?\u201dTan Limei sat down on her chair. \u201cThe leader of Confidential Document Department is not around. Director Li told us to send the documents again in the afternoon.\u201dDong Xuebing looked around and saw there were no outsiders. He asked softly: \u201ctan Zhi, is it because I am still under my probation? Why Chief Zhou never pick Zhuang Zhi and me to deliver those important documents? Is he afraid that we will look at the documents?\u201dTan Limei laughed. \u201cI am not sure about this. What\u2019s wrong? You are jealous of me and Sister Chang?\u201dDong Xuebing sulked. \u201cDo I need to? But I just feel that the leader does not seems to trust me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not he doesn\u2019t trust you, it\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d Tan Limei paused for a while and looked around the office. She picked up a document and pretended to be discussing the document with him. \u201cI had wanted to warn you yesterday. I think Chief Zhou might be slightly pissed with you.\u201dDong Xuebing was shocked. \u201cImpossible\u2026\u2026 I did not do anything to make him angry.\u201dTan Limei continued. \u201cThis is only my opinion. That day when you had the conflict with Guo Shunjie, you purposely did not say you were in Chief Zhou\u2019s office and lead Guo Shunjie to say those things. Yes. Guo Shunjie was scolded by Chief Zhou. But have you ever thought that what you did was forcing Chief Zhou to step in to scold Guo Shunjie? He had no choice as one of his subordinates was shouting outside. If he still did not step in, people will lose respect for him.\u201d\u201cDamn!\u201d Dong Xuebing felt this might really be true.\u201cThat\u2019s why although Chief Zhou did not say anything, in his heart\u2026\u2026 you should know.\u201d Tan Limei had been in the government sector for more than one year. She could see further than Dong Xuebing. \u201cChief Zhou had asked Guo Shunjie to follow him along for his errands was the leader\u2019s art of carrot and stick. Since he had shown that he is the boss of the office, there was no need to make things worse. At the same time, he was giving you a warning.\u201dDong Xuebing was grateful. \u201cThank you so much for telling me this. If you did not tell me, I would still be wondering why Chief Zhou was treating me differently. So, this was the reason.\u201dSighed\u2026\u2026. I was still too na\u00efve.Dong Xuebing reflected on himself. This was a lesson to him. Suddenly he felt slightly cold and walked over to press the remote of the air conditional. He tried to raise the temperature, but the button might be spoilt. It had no reaction after pushing for a while.\u201cYou need to press harder. Press as hard as you can.\u201d Changjuan said. \u201cThe thermoset is faulty.\u201d\u201cDid we report it?\u201d Dong Xuebing used his strength to press and beep. The temperature indicator increased a notched. \u201cDamn, adjusting the temperature is also manual labor.\u201dOld Yan who was reading his newspapers laughed. \u201cIt was repaired several times, but it was still faulty. Recently, the budget was tight, and the higher-ups do not allow us to replace it. Not only this air conditional, that water dispenser cold water is also faulty. The electric kettle in Director Li Qing\u2019s office was also faulty. It will stop working when boiling water. Just make do with it first.\u201dSomeone opened the door of the office. It was General Affairs Office\u2019s head. Director Li Qing. \u201cBureau Chief Yan need someone to help him carry things. One of you needs to follow me.\u201d Bureau Chief Yan\u2019s full name was Yan Liang. He was the Chief of this district\u2019s branch bureau. The real head of this place. He had more authority than the District Political Commissar.When heard that it would be helping Bureau Chief Yan to carry things, Dong Xuebing stood up. \u201cDirector Li, I will go.\u201dLi Qing looked at him and laughed. \u201cNever mind. Let Xiao Sun go. He is stronger.\u201dZhuang Zhi immediately stops what he was doing and followed Li Qing out of the office.Dong Xuebing slapped the back of his head in frustration. He felt his presence in the office was getting smaller and smaller.On the other side, a car was traveling back to the Western District Branch Bureau. Zhou Changchun casually asked. \u201cWhat do you all think of Xiao Dong?\u201dGuo Panwei, who was driving, was surprised at this question. \u201cXiao Dong is too young. Although his work attitude was good, he was too impulsive\u2026\u2026.\u201d He was afraid of Dong Xuebing competing with him. So, he did not hold back his words.Guo Shunjie saw there were no changes in Zhou Changchun\u2019s expression, he cleared his throat and said. \u201cChief Zhou, I am not saying this because I had some conflicts with Xiao Dong in the past. He is too immature. Just because he had written a draft of a speech for Bureau Chief Yang, he became so proud and had no respect for you. That day, he tricked me. If I knew that you were the one who called him into your office, I will also not\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Changchun frowned.Guo Shunjie also stopped speaking. He was laughing in his heart. Seems like Chief Zhou was not very pleased with Dong Xuebing.Guo Panwei was also thinking in his heart. Chief Zhou should not trust that Xiao Dong much. If not, he would not initiate this conversation with both of them.Branch Bureau\u2019s cafeteria.Dong Xuebing, Tan Limei, and Zhuang Zhi were sitting at a small table having their lunch. Dong Xuebing was thinking of a way to change Zhou Changchun\u2019s impression of him and earn the trust of the two leaders of the General Affairs Office while eating. He was thinking hard, but could not think of a good solution. He sighed. It was too complicated to survive in the government sector. If this carries on, it might be years before he could get his promotion. He needs an opportunity to prove himself.Dong Xuebing looked around and saw Zhou Changchun and Li Qing entering the cafeteria.Dong Xuebing called out to them. \u201cChief Zhou, Division Chief.\u201d But they did not hear him and sat down at an empty table not far away. Dong Xuebing sat down embarrassed and continued eating his lunch.After eating for a while, Li Qing remembered something and frowned. \u201cOld Zhou, did I unplug the electric kettle in my office?\u201dZhou Changchun replied. \u201cI did not notice when we are leaving your office.\u201d He knew that the electric kettle in Li Qing\u2019s office was faulty. No matter how long the water was boiling, it will not stop heating unless you unplug it. \u201cShall I go up and check?\u201dLi Qing replied: \u201cLet\u2019s have lunch first.\u201dDong Xuebing and Tan Limei overheard their conversation. Dong Xuebing wanted to go up to them and offer to check the kettle for them. But he remembered that there were many important documents in Li Qing\u2019s office and most likely he was not allowed to enter. So he did not approach them.Suddenly there were shouts outside the cafeteria.Everybody looked out. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cFire. The grey building is on fire!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The fire was at the General Affairs Office\u2019s building. Thick billowing smoke was coming out from the second floor. It was slightly further away from Dong Xuebing\u2019s office. The thick smoke had covered the corridor and coming out from the windows. It seems that the fire was quite big.\u201cWhose office was that? Why did it catch fire?\u201d\u201cCall 119!\u201d\u201cWe had called just now.\u201dThe compound was filled with people.At first, Dong Xuebing still did not think much of the fire. It was none of his business. But when he saw Li Qing and Zhou Changchun\u2019s face, he immediately realized something was wrong. He looked at the second floor where the smoke was coming out. Damn! That was Li Qing\u2019s office!Li Qing shouted: \u201cQuick. All those from the General Affairs Office, follow me!\u201dZhou Changchun was wiping his sweat on his face and ran behind Li Qing towards that burning building. \u201cHurry and put out the fire.\u201dGuo Shunjie and Guo Panwei had caught up with them. Dong Xuebing knew that this was an emergency. He quickly ran forward with Tan Limei. Dong Xuebing knew that it was the faulty electric kettle that caused the fire. Li Qing and Zhou Changchun had forgotten to unplug it before leaving the office. They had to take responsibility for the fire, and the two very important documents were still in his office. If the documents were damaged, the whole General Affairs Office might be punished.The corridor on the second floor was covered in thick smoke, and it was choking.There were some people from the Political Section and Finance Department trying to put out the fire. They were throwing pails of water at the burning wooden door.\u201cThe door is damaged by the fire and cannot be opened.\u201d\u201cPut out the fire on the door first. Stop it from spreading.\u201d\u201cGet a few more pails of water! It is not enough!\u201dLi Qing was panicking. He grabbed a fire extinguisher along the way to the building and spray it on the door. Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei could not find any fire extinguishers. They could only get the pails and collect water from the washroom nearby. Changjuan, Dong Xuebing and the rest arrived shortly and helped to put out the fire.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Li Qing, tell me what is happening?\u201d A stern looking middle-aged man ran over from the end of the corridor. He was Yan Liang, Director of the District Branch Bureau.Li Qing was panicking: \u201cDirector Yan, I\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know why my office caught fire.\u201d He was lying through his teeth and trying to avoid taking responsibility.Director Yan points at him: \u201cI don\u2019t care. Hurry up and save whatever documents in there!\u201d\u201cDirector Yan, I, I\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Qing was at a loss of words. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if the rest of the documents were damaged. But\u2026\u2026 but the two documents you passed to me this morning is\u2026\u2026 still in my office.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Director Yan\u2019s face changed. \u201cSay that again?\u201dLi Qing\u2019s fire extinguisher had run out, and he quickly explained: \u201cThis morning, the Confidential Documents Department was having a meeting and there was no one to accept the documents. So, I brought it back to my office and will deliver it after lunch. But who knows\u2026\u2026\u201dDirector Yan shouted: \u201cAre you allowed to keep those documents in your office? What did I tell you when I pass you the documents? Those documents have no backups and were very important. How can you leave it in your office and go out for lunch? Do you know the procedures of handling these highly classified documents? Do you know?!\u201dZhou Changchun was standing by the side sweating profusely.Li Qing replied: \u201cDirector, don\u2019t worry. There should be enough time to get the documents out.\u201d The fire on the office door was extinguished. Li Qing shouted to Guo Panwei. \u201cStop trying to put out the fire and kick the door down. Get the documents in my desk\u2019s second drawer on the right. Get it out of the fire even if it cost your life!\u201dGuo Panwei knew that if he could rescue the documents from the fire, it will be a great credit. He rushed forward and kicked on the door. Bang! But the door did not open. Dong Xuebing also saw this opportunity and wanted to kick the door. But Guo Shunjie pushed him aside and kicked the door.Bang!The door fell off its latches.Dong Xuebing nearly cursed out loud after seeing the chance to gain credit was snatched by others.Guo Shunjie was laughing in his heart and wanted to rush into the office.Guo Panwei was not far behind either. He ran into the room after him.But after they stepped into the room, they could feel the heat in their faces. The room was covered in thick black smoke.Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie got shocked. They used all their strength to avoid the fire and run out of the room.Li Qing and Zhou Changchun who were panicking shouted out orders: \u201cGo in and get the documents. It is in the second drawer!\u201dGuo Panwei and Guo Shunjie thought the fire was only around the door. But when they entered the room, they saw everything in the office were on fire. The shelves filled with books, the stacks of documents in the corners, computer, writing desk, etc. were all on fire. They were staring at the raging fire in the office. Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei were not willing to go in and risk their lives. No matter how big that credit was, it was not worth using their lives to exchange for it.\u201cI can\u2019t. The documents must have been burnt by the fire.\u201d Guo Panwei moved back.Guo Shunjie also took a few steps back. He was afraid the fire would burn him.Li Qing cursed silently and clenched his fist. He wanted to run into the room, but he hesitated. He does not have the guts to enter the room.\u201cThe fire extinguisher is here!\u201d Zhuang Zhi and Tan Limei were running from a distance with a fire extinguisher each. They tried to extinguish the fire.Everybody at the scene knew there was no way to save those documents. The fire was raging.Director Yan pointed at Li Qing and Zhou Changchun: \u201cWhat the hell is your General Affairs Office doing?!\u201d He paused for a while and continued. \u201cDo you know what those documents are? Do you know?! Your department cannot even do such a simple task. What is the use of keeping all of you here? I want your resignation letter on my desk tomorrow!\u201dZhou Changchun knew there was nothing he could do. He lowered his head and kept quiet. He thought he would be able to retire at the rank of Section Chief, but now\u2026\u2026..Tan Limei, Guo Panwei and the rest were all looking down in shame.Li Qing could not say a word. Resign? This job was essential to him. His daughter needs his salary to pay for her medical treatment. If he lost his job, what would he do? There was no way he could do anything now.Suddenly there was a loud splash.A man snatched a pail of water and splashed on himself, making himself all wet and ran into the burning office. Everybody was shocked.It was Dong Xuebing!Everybody at the scene was staring in disbelieve.This person dares to jump into the sea of fire?\u201cXiao Dong!\u201d\u201cBing Zhi!\u201d\u201cAre you trying to kill yourself?

He was terrified of dying.If it were in the past, he would never rush in even if a gun was pointing at his head. It was dangerous.But now, Dong Xuebing was different. He has the special ability, BACK, as his trump card. He has an extra life compared to everyone else in the world. He could use BACK to return to the time where he was unhurt if he encountered some dangerous situation. With this power, his wellbeing was not his top priority. He had died once before, what\u2019s wrong with dying again? Anyway, he will not really die. What matter the most to him was to gain credit and accomplish some achievement to gain the trust of his higher-ups. This was the reason why Dong Xuebing rushes into the burning office without second thoughts.The fire was burning everywhere around Dong Xuebing.The thick smoke blocked Dong Xuebing\u2019s vision, and he could not see a thing in the office. He choked on the smoke and coughed a few times before covering his mouth with his wet sleeves. Tears were flowing from his eyes, and he quickly walks forward in the darkness.Hot. He could feel his skin burning.Dong Xuebing could not stand it after entering the office for a few seconds. He avoided something burning on the floor and gritted his teeth.There were shouts and screams behind him. Everyone was calling him to get out of the office.\u201cXiao Dong!\u201d It was Li Qing\u2019s hoarse voice. \u201cCome out! Don\u2019t care about the documents. Your life is more important!\u201dZhou Changchun also shouted: \u201cXiao Bing, get out of the office immediately! This is an order!\u201d\u201cBing Zhi, are you mad? The fire is getting bigger! Come out now!\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s colleagues were all calling for him.Dong Xuebing also thought that the documents should be burned to ashes by now. But his purpose was not to find the documents. He wants to show that he was fearless and could help the higher-ups in critical times. He ignored all their cries and move quickly to a half-opened door in the office. He kicked the burning door open and entered the room. Crash! It was the sound of something heavy crashing down. He could feel the floor shook. He turned around and saw a bookcase had collapsed, blocking the main door. His exit was blocked!Dong Xuebing got a fright from the loud sound. Damn!\u201cOh no!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Bing Zhi cannot come out now!\u201d\u201cHurry and save him!\u201dEveryone outside was panicking. They used the fire extinguisher on the burning bookcase, hoping to clear an exit path for Dong Xuebing. If the fire on the bookshelf was not extinguished, Dong Xuebing would have no escape route and will either be burned to death or suffocated from the smoke.Dong Xuebing hesitated for a while. But he still entered the smaller room in the office.Crash!A desk on his left had crashed down, and the table top and legs hit Dong Xuebing\u2019s pants. It immediately burned a hole in his pants and parts of his leg was burned. He screamed out in pain. Cold sweat was dripping down his back. He endured the pain and extinguished the fire on his pants with his hand. The pain made him more determined. He strained his eyes to see through the thick smoke and limped towards a burning pile by the side of the room. It was Li Qing\u2019s desk.Crash!The fluorescent lights above exploded from the high heat.The glass pieces fell on Dong Xuebing, and some cut his back, neck, and hands. Blood was flowing out from his wounds.Dong Xuebing cursed and limped forward. He was trying his best to keep his conscious.He got closer, and he could see the burning desk clearer. Dong Xuebing was overjoyed to see that the drawers on the left were only burning slightly. It was not engulfed in flames entirely. He immediately reached out for the second drawer without thinking. Ah!!!! His fingers were burned when he touched the drawer. It was excruciating. He quickly uses his leg to kick the locked drawer.Bang! Bang!Two kicks.Cracked! The scorched parts of the drawer cracked, and there was a big opening. Dong Xuebing could see 2 brown envelopes in the drawer!The documents were still around!Dong Xuebing was very excited. He ignored the pain on his hands and reached into the drawer to grab the envelopes. The envelopes were slightly burned on the edges. Dong Xuebing was coughing heavily from the thick smoke. He covered his nose and mouth and lowered his body. He tried to make his way back out of the office. But the collapsed bookcase was blocking the main exit. He could not escape from there. The people outside were still trying to put out the fire and remove the debris of the bookcase.Hurry up and let me escape!Dong Xuebing could feel his head getting heavier and giddier\u2026\u2026.He wanted to use all his strength to move nearer to the exit, but he had inhaled too much smoke. His brains and body were not listening to him!Dong Xuebing\u2019s vision slowly became blurred. Bang! He fell onto the floor.The moment the documents touched the floor, it started burning. Dong Xuebing was also screaming in pain as the fire engulfs his whole body.Dead\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing knew he was dying.He used his final strength to shout out: \u201cBACK!\u201d\u2026\u2026Everywhere around Dong Xuebing was still burning.The 2 envelopes were still in the drawer and could be seen from the cracked opening.Time had returned to 1 minute before.Dong Xuebing could feel his mind shook. He could feel his body again, but he was still feeling giddy. No matter what, it was still better than the few seconds before he was about to die earlier. He knew that the thick smoke was toxic, and he does not have much time. Even if he could get the documents, he still could not get out of the office alive.Dong Xuebing could not afford to waste time. He grabbed the two envelopes again, and this time, he did not pick the earlier path which led to his death. He ran towards the window panels of the office and picked up a porcelain teacup along the way. He threw the cup at the window panel with all his strength, smashing the windows.This office was located on the second floor. Although it was dangerous to jump out of the window, it was better than suffocating to death by the thick smoke.Dong Xuebing could feel he was at his limits. He took in some fresh air near the windows and at the awning below. The awning was to shelter the parked bicycles below. Dong Xuebing felt slightly relieved when he saw the plastic canopy. He hugged the documents and slowly climb out of the window. He used his fingernails to press hard on his temples to clear his mind, before using the last of his strength to jump down.4 meters\u2026\u20263 meters\u2026\u20262 meters\u2026\u2026Crash!!!Dong Xuebing could feel the pain on his left shoulders, and his body hit on the blue translucent plastic shelter. He landed on the awning and lost his balance and rolled down the sides. Bang! He fell from the canopy onto the concrete ground, barely missing a few parked bicycles.He was gasping for fresh air.Dong Xuebing resisted the urged to vomit and looked at the blue skies. He was finally safe.He was alive!He did not die!3 minutes later\u2026\u2026Footsteps could be heard coming closer to him.It was the people who were trying to put out the fire. All of them had run to the back of the building. Among them, it was the Chief of the General Affairs Office and Dong Xuebing\u2019s colleagues.\u201cBing Zhi! Bing Zhi!\u201d\u201cXiao Dong, how are you feeling?! Are you okay?!\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s body was covered with burns and bruises. He could not stand up. He tried his best to give them a smile.Tan Limei, Zhuang Zhi, Changjuan and the rest got closer to him and saw Dong Xuebing covered in blood and burns lying on the ground. All of them were shocked: \u201cCall the ambulance! Quick!\u201d Zhuang Zhi was the closest to Dong Xuebing. He shouted and move forward to try to help him up.Li Qing was deeply touched. \u201cXiao Dong\u2026\u2026 you\u2026\u2026 Sighed. You know that the documents were burned and yet you still\u2026\u2026.\u201dDong Xuebing was still panting and said: \u201cThe documents are not burned.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Li Qing, Zhou Changchun and everyone at the scene were shocked.Dong Xuebing turned his body painfully to his sides and took out 2 envelopes under him. \u201cAre these the documents?\u201d\u201cYou found it?\u201d Li Qing and Zhou Changchun could not believe their eyes. They're almost cried on the spot and quickly walk forward to pick up the bloody brown envelopes. \u201cYes! Yes! These are the documents!\u201d Li Qing was so ecstatic until he did not know what to say. \u201cYou\u2026\u2026 This\u2026\u2026 Xiao Dong\u2026\u2026 Good job! Terrific!\u201dEveryone was stunned by Dong Xuebing.Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie looked at each other. They could not believe what had happened. Earlier when Dong Xuebing rushed into the burning office, no one expects him to come out alive. Let alone escaping with the documents.Zhou Changchun looked at Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie who were staring at Dong Xuebing in disbelieved. His opinion of Dong Xuebing had changed. Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie had still claimed that Xiao Dong was impulsive and immature. But what did the both of them do just now? They were hiding away from the fire. Dong Xuebing was much more dependable than them.Director Yan had also arrived and was shocked by Dong Xuebing\u2019s actions. He looked at Dong Xuebing and took the documents from Li Qing. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to write your resignation letter, but you will still be punished. Go back and write a report for me.\u201dLi Qing replied. \u201cYes, Sir. Thank you, Director Yan.\u201dZhou Changchun also said: \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d Both of them were overjoyed for not need to resign.\u201cDon\u2019t need to thank me.\u201d Director Yan looked at Dong Xuebing who was still sitting on the floor. \u201cIf you two want to thank someone, you should thank him. Both of you are really lucky to have such a good subordinate.\u201dLi Qing and Zhou Changchun nodded.That\u2019s right. Which leader will also feel the same for having a subordinate who was willing to risk his life for his leaders. At least, there was no one else like Dong Xuebing in the Western District Branch Bureau.At this moment, everyone\u2019s impression of Dong Xuebing changed. This person was crazy and was willing to risk his life\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhuang Zhi who had accompanied him helped to get him admitted into the hospital. After a whole afternoon of checks and treatment, Dong Xuebing\u2019s injuries were under controlled. His arms and legs had some first-degree burns. He also sprained his shoulders and ankles. The cuts caused by the fluorescent lights were also bandaged. Overall, he was not too severely injured.In the evening, everyone from the General Affairs Office, including the leaders, arrived at the hospital to visit him.Dong Xuebing who was lying on the bed had just taken his temperature. 37.3 degrees. As the nurse took the thermometer away, Li Qing and Zhou Changchun walked into the ward. Dong Xuebing immediately tried to sit up. \u201cDirector Li, Chief Zhou.\u201d But Dong Xuebing\u2019s shoulders were hurting and could not sit upright.Li Qing quickly steps forward and stop Dong Xuebing. \u201cDon\u2019t get up. Just lie on the bed.\u201dGuo Panwei looked at Dong Xuebing who was wearing the hospital gown and did not say a word. Instead, he carried two chairs over for the leaders.Zhou Changchun and Li Qing sat down by the bed and asked. \u201cXiao Dong, how are your injuries?\u201dDong Xuebing was not used to be surrounded by so many people. He coughed. \u201cErrr\u2026. Thank you for asking. I feel well now. I think I can be discharged tomorrow.\u201dLi Qing had asked Zhuang Zhi about Dong Xuebing\u2019s condition and knew that Dong Xuebing was putting up a brave front. He frowned: \u201cHow can you be discharged tomorrow? You can\u2019t even get off the bed now, how can the hospital discharge you tomorrow? Xiao Dong, don\u2019t worry about your work. Old Zhou and I will take care of your probation performance report and your hospital bills. You don\u2019t need to do anything and focus on recovering well.\u201dZhou Changchun nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You need to rest well.\u201dLi Qing and Zhou Changchun had escaped from being forced to resign because of Dong Xuebing. Both of them were grateful to him. Even Li Qing helped Dong Xuebing poured a glass of water personally. Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei had never seen Li Qing and Zhou Changchun treating a subordinate so well. They were jealous of Dong Xuebing, but they could not show it. After all, Dong Xuebing had done something great.Dong Xuebing had also said it casually. Seeing the leaders granting him permission to recuperate in the hospital, he did not insist on discharging. He did not want to be discharged. First, he was still injured, and his mother was not in Beijing. There will be no one taking care of him at home. Secondly, if he discharged too early, Li Qing and Zhou Changchun will not feel that they owe him a lot. He had to pretend to be \u201cseriously injured\u201d to show the leaders that he risked his life to help them.Dong Xuebing was not very smart but was still quick-witted.Li Qing and Zhou Changchun took turns to say some pleasantries to Dong Xuebing. After a while, Li Qing\u2019s mobile phone rang. He took a look at the number and left the ward with Zhou Changchun to answer the call.After the leaders were gone, Dong Xuebing\u2019s colleagues were more at ease.Tan Limei laughed and showed Dong Xuebing a thumbs up. \u201cBing Zhi, I am impressed by your guts. The fire was so big, and you dare to rush in. I was so stunned back then.Changjuan also laughed: \u201cYou think you are the only one? Everyone out there was stunned. Luckily you are alright.\u201dOld Yan said gently: \u201cXiao Dong, you did us proud.\u201dDong Xuebing was feeling great, but he modestly replied: \u201cStop praising me. I did not think much and just know that if the documents were destroyed by the fire, the whole General Affairs Office would be in trouble. That\u2019s why I rushed in.\u201dGuo Shunjie knew Dong Xuebing was talking rubbish.Guo Panwei was also thinking the same thing. If there is no credit for doing this, will you still risk your life by running into the office? Who are you trying to fool?But they could only say all these in their hearts. No matter what, Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei were impressed by Dong Xuebing\u2019s guts. If given a chance again, Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei will still not enter the office to risk their lives.The door opened.Li Qing and Zhou Changchun entered the ward again. The people surrounding Dong Xuebing\u2019s bed moved aside to make way for the leaders.Li Qing sat down beside the bed and patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s hand. \u201cI have just received news that the Bureau had approved your application and you are now a Party member.\u201dTan Limei and the rest were surprised. \u201cDidn\u2019t Bing Zhi submit his application two weeks ago?\u201dDong Xuebing was also shocked to hear this. \u201cMe? Approved?\u201d He had not even submitted a periodical report and had not enrolled in any of the courses. He needs at least one year to qualify as a Party Activist and another year to become a Probationary Party member. How come he become a Party member two weeks after submitting his application? This was not right.Zhou Changchun laughed. \u201cYour approval is an exceptional case.\u201dEveryone in the ward understood why.Joining the Party through exceptional approval happens quite frequently during the rescue efforts of natural disasters like earthquakes, or war. Those individuals with exceptional performances and contributions are allowed to join the Party immediately.Li Qing explained. \u201cThis afternoon, after we put out the fire, Old Zhou and I had a discussion and decided to submit your application letter to the higher-ups. We applied for an exceptional approval for you. The phone call earlier was to inform us that the application is approved and when you return to work, you will be sworn in. After that, you will be Probationary Party member.\u201d Actually, Dong Xuebing\u2019s performance in the afternoon was still not good enough to qualify for exceptional approval. But to repay Dong Xuebing, Li Qing and Zhou Changchun made a few trips to their leaders\u2019 offices to talk about this exceptional approval. Director Yan had also seen Dong Xuebing\u2019s bravery, and with his help, the approval was granted.Gou Panwei and Guo Shunjie were jealous. It was rare to see someone getting exceptional approval.Dong Xuebing was overjoyed! This was not what he expected. He will be a party member, and it will look good on his resume. He showed a \u201cgrateful\u201d expression: \u201cThank you, Director Li, Thank you, Chief Zhou. I will not let you all down. I will work harder for the Communist Party and will be prepared to sacrifice myself for the party and people\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Qing laughed: \u201cThis is not the place for you to pledge your loyalty to the Party.\u201d\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u2026.\u201d Everyone laughs.After all the visitors left, Dong Xuebing covered his whole body under the blanket and laughed. All these injuries were worth it. Not only he had gained the trust of Li Qing and Zhou Changchun, even the Director and all his colleagues were impressed by him. Most importantly, he had successfully joined the CPC.Hahahaha\u2026\u2026.. I am a Party member now!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was the start of Autumn and the morning air was fresh. The nurse conducted her morning rounds and woke Dong Xuebing. He yawned and greeted the old man, with a fractured leg, in the same ward. Dong Xuebing slowly makes his way down his bed and poured himself a cup of warm water. He wore his slippers and was about to ask the nurse at the nurses\u2019 station on what other checks he had today when his iPhone 4 rang. It was Qu Yunxuan\u2019s number.Dong Xuebing cleared his throat and swiped the screen to answer: \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cXiao Bing, where are you? How come you did not return home last night?\u201dDong Xuebing was afraid Qu Yunxuan would be worried and did not want to let her see him lying in bed so pathetically. So, he did not inform her and his hospitalization. He called her yesterday and told her that he will be having dinner with his colleagues. \u201cAh\u2026\u2026 We had dinner until quite late yesterday, and I stayed over at my colleague\u2019s place. I had just wake up and is preparing to go to work now.\u201d When he finishes this sentence, a nurse walked in with a few small plastic containers and shouted. \u201cThe medicine is here. Take it half an hour after breakfast.\u201d\u201cWhat medicine?\u201d Qu Yunxuan asked nervously. \u201cXiao Bing, where are you?\u201dDong Xuebing stuttered: \u201cNothing\u2026\u2026 nothing\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s the television.\u201d\u201cYou think I am stupid? Hurry up and tell me the truth!\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s lies were exposed, and he could only tell her the truth. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 I am at Jiangong Hospital. It\u2019s like this\u2026\u2026. Yesterday there was a fire at my workplace, and there were some important documents in the office. I ran in to retrieve the documents and suffered some minor burns. It is not very serious. I will be discharged in one or two days. You don\u2019t need to visit me. I am fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAunt Xuan? What\u2019s wrong? Why are you keeping silent?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cErrrm\u2026\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to lie to you.\u201d\u201cDooo\u2026\u2026 dooo\u2026\u2026 dooo\u2026\u2026\u201d The line was cut.Dong Xuebing was sweating nervously. Was Aunt Xuan angry with him?Dong Xuebing tried to call Qu Yunxuan again, but she did not pick up his calls.Breakfast was ready, and Dong Xuebing kept his phone. He took out a 10 RMB food ticket bought by Zhuang Zhi yesterday and paid the lady pushing the food cart. After getting his breakfast, he slowly peeled the shells of an egg with one hand. He spent a long time removing the shell. The nurses in the hospital will not care for the patients other than doing their jobs of changing the drips, changing oxygen tanks, taking temperature, etc. They will not do anything extra for the patients. If you need someone to feed you, you will need to hire a caretaker, and it cost tens of RMB a day. Dong Xuebing did not want to spend that money and tried to do everything himself.Half an hour after breakfast, he took his medicine, and he could hear the sounds of heels down the corridor.Click, click, click, click, the footsteps were fast and strong.A person\u2019s figure rushed past the door of the ward, and the sounds of the heels stopped. The person turned back quickly, and push opened the door of Dong Xuebing\u2019s ward. It was Qu Yunxuan.Dong Xuebing, who was half lying on the bed, was nervous to see her. \u201cAunt Xuan, didn\u2019t I told you not to visit me?\u201dQu Yunxuan\u2019s eyes turn red as she saw Dong Xuebing covered in bandages and burns wounds. She bit her lower lips and did not say a word.\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026. Aunt Xuan, take a sit.\u201d Dong Xuebing pushes a chair next to his bed.Aunt Xuan was still not saying anything and was still looking at his wounds.Dong Xuebing\u2019s whole body was covered with severe and minor injuries. He does not look like the type of men Qu Yunxuan likes now. Dong Xuebing tried to cover most of his wounds with his blanket, leaving only some minor injuries outside. \u201cIt is not as serious as you thought. I\u2019m fine. All these are just minor injuries. I will recover in a few days.\u201dQu Yunxuan seems to be mad, and she shouted at Dong Xuebing: \u201cIt is the job of the firemen to put out the fire. Why didn\u2019t the others from your workplace go and put out the fire except for you? Are you the only person left in your entire workplace?\u201d Qu Yunxuan lifted her hand and slapped Dong Xuebing\u2019s exposed arm. \u201cTry to be a hero? Huh? Who ask you to be a hero?\u201d She slapped his arm more than 10 times.Dong Xuebing had never seen Aunt Xuan so angry before. He did not dare to make any noise.\u201cI am worried sick for you.\u201d Qu Yunxuan was snuffled and wiped her tears with the back of her hand.Dong Xuebing panicked. \u201cAunt Xuan, I\u2019m sorry. Stop crying. I will not try to be a hero the next time.\u201d He felt good to be scolded by Qu Yunxuan. He could feel that she was anxious about him. \u201cThe next time I see a fire, I will run away. Really! I promise you.\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at him and then touched the wounds on his arm gently. \u201cIs it painful?\u201dDong Xuebing laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhere else are you hurt? Let me see.\u201d\u201cI only sprained my ankles. There are no fractures. I\u2019m fine.\u201dQu Yunxuan lifted his blanket and saw all the wounds on his body. She was about to start crying again before staring at Dong Xuebing angrily: \u201cXiao Bing, you must not hide anything from me in the future. If you dare to lie to me again, I will smack you on your buttocks!\u201dThe old man and his son at the adjacent bed were laughing at Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing blushed: \u201cI will not lie to you again.\u201dQu Yunxuan continued to nag at him.Dong Xuebing just went along with her and agreed to whatever she said.The old man with his leg in a cast laughed and interrupt: \u201cGirl, stop scolding him. This young man had made a huge contribution. His leaders and colleagues had visited him yesterday, and I heard that he will be getting an exceptional approval to be a Party Member.\u201dDong Xuebing also replied cheerfully: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I will be a party member soon.\u201dQu Yunxuan touched Dong Xuebing\u2019s face gently. \u201cNothing is more important than your life. If something happens to you, how am I going to face Sister Luan?\u201d\u201cHuh? Please don\u2019t let my mother know about what happened.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dQu Yunxuan stayed by Dong Xuebing and took care of him for a while before going to see his doctor. She wants to ask about Dong Xuebing\u2019s condition.After she returns, Dong Xuebing said. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Hurry and go to work.\u201dQu Yunxuan shook her head and used a wet towel to wipe his face. \u201cI had applied for leave. I still have 5 days annual leave left. I will accompany you these few days in the hospital.\u201d\u201cNo need. I am fine.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t even walk by yourself, and you call this fine? The doctor had told me that you need someone to accompany by your side.\u201d\u201cI am really fine.\u201d\u201cIf you say one more word, I will tear your mouth!\u201dSeeing that Qu Yunxuan could not be persuaded, Dong Xuebing could only accept her help.Accompany by the bed? Sigh\u2026\u2026 It would be better if she could accompany me in the bed\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was excruciating. Qu Yunxuan had nothing much to do in the ward, and she took his keys. She left for his home to help him bring his towels, underwear, socks, etc. She also needs to help him bring a set of clean clothes. The newly bought suit and shoes were all damaged in the fire.After Qu Yunxuan left, the nurse who was inserting the drip laughed: \u201cYour aunt is so pretty.\u201dThe old man also said: \u201cThat girl is so nice to you.\u201dDong Xuebing felt proud. It was as if they were praising him.Qu Yunxuan returned before 11 am with a small suitcase. She had brought clothes, toothbrush, shampoo, plates, etc. along with her and packed everything into the small cabinet beside Dong Xuebing\u2019s bed. She was sweating and panting. But she did not stop. She lifted Dong Xuebing\u2019s blanket and change his socks for him. After that, she took a plastic basin and soap to the washroom to help wash his dirty socks.Dong Xuebing was touched. \u2018Aunt Xuan, rest for a while.\u201dQu Yunxuan turned and smiled. She still had foams on her hands. \u201cI am not tired. You stop moving about. You are still on a drip.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dAunt Xuan was squatting down washing the clothes, and her back was facing Dong Xuebing. Her clothes were pulled up slightly, exposing her lower back. Dong Xuebing\u2019s eyes were glued to her back. Maybe he was imagining something naughty and suddenly had the urge to pee. He looked at the bottle of drip hang above him. There were at least half a bottle more. It will last at least half an hour more. He tried to control the urge, but could not stand it anymore. He endured the pain in his shoulders and legs and slowly got off the bed to wear his slippers.Qu Yunxuan who had finished washing his socks was shocked. \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled. \u201cI need to go to the toilet.\u201d He reached out to grab the drip.\u201cStop moving. You are not allowed to move.\u201d Qu Yunxuan hurriedly washed her hands. \u201cThe drip is attached to your moveable hand. You cannot carry the drip with that hand.\u201dIt was hard for Dong Xuebing to visit the toilet yesterday. Today, it was harder with the drip. Dong Xuebing also knew that he was not allowed to move. But it was embarrassing for him to ask Aunt Xuan to help him. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I will be out in a minute to help you.\u201d Dong Xuebing ignored her and pressed the drip\u2019s valve, stopping the drip. He carried the bottle and limped towards the toilet.Qu Yunxuan walked towards him angrily. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you listen to me? You want me to hit you?\u201d She took the bottle from him and helped him to the toilet. \u201cDon\u2019t try to be a hero. Come, I will help you.\u201dDong Xuebing replied embarrassedly: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can do it myself.\u201dQu Yunxuan waved her hand: \u201cYou want me to hit you? Hurry up and go!\u201d\u201cOk\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing knew he could not win against her and limped into the toilet.Usually, the toilets in the hospital will have hooks for hanging the drip bottle. But Dong Xuebing and Qu Yunxuan looked around and did not see the hooks. It was embarrassing, and both of them paused for a second before Qu Yunxuan closes the door behind her and lifted the toilet seat. She raised the bottle of drip above her head and turned towards the wall. \u201cHurry. I will not look at you.\u201dDong Xuebing almost died from the embarrassment. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026 You\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you shy of?\u201d Qu Yunxuan turned and stared at him. \u201cHurry!\u201dDong Xuebing almost cried when he saw Qu Yunxuan turning and looking at him. He slowly untied his hospital pants but did not lower it.\u201cI will count to 3, and I will really hit you.\u201d Qu Yunxuan said with her back facing him. \u201c1\u2026\u2026 2\u2026\u2026 3\u2026\u2026.\u201dDong Xuebing gritted his teeth, lower his pants and start to pee.The was the first time Dong Xuebing felt that the splashing sounds of peeing were so embarrassing.After the splashing sounds stopped, Qu Yunxuan helped him flushed and helped him back to his bed. \u201cAunt had bought some bananas and apples on the way here. Which would you like to eat?\u201dDong Xuebing who just laid down replied. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cHow can you not eat fruits? You need the vitamins.\u201d Qu Yunxuan helped him peeled a banana and turned it to him. \u201cListen to me and open your mouth. Ah\u2026\u2026.\u201d Dong Xuebing thought to himself. This was also not the first time he embarrassed himself in front of Aunt Xuan. He ignored the looks of the old man and his son and took a bite of the banana. Qu Yunxuan laughed. \u201cGood boy. Take one more bite. Ah\u2026\u2026\u201d Aunt Xuan had one leg kneeling on the bed as she moved closer to Dong Xuebing to feed the banana.Qu Yunxuan\u2019s knee which was covered in her skinned colored stockings moved under the warm blanket.Dong Xuebing could feel something warm and smoothed touch his hand. It was Qu Yunxuan\u2019s leg!Dong Xuebing\u2019s mind started to wonder and said out the words again. \u201cAunt Xuan, I really like you. Can you be my girlfriend?\u201dQu Yunxuan was stunned and her hand, holding the banana, froze in mid-air.With the previous experience, Dong Xuebing was more confident this time. \u201cI have never met anyone as virtuous as you. I had fallen in love with you the first time we met. Aunt Xuan, I know I am not good enough for you. But I really hope you will give me a chance.\u201dQu Yunxuan blushed and placed the banana on the table. \u201cIt is too sudden. I\u2026\u2026 I am not prepared at all.\u201dDong Xuebing was overjoyed. Aunt Xuan did not say that he was not her type this time. Hahaha. Seems like becoming clean and tidy works. This was one more step to success. \u201cI know it is sudden. But I really like you. Can you be my girlfriend?\u201dQu Yunxuan kept quiet.\u201cCan?\u201dAfter a while, she sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Xiao Bing. I have no intentions of dating now.\u201dAlthough Dong Xuebing knew that he will be rejected, but he can\u2019t help feeling disappointed. \u201cWhy? Am I not good looking enough? Is it my character or something else?\u201dQu Yunxuan shook her head and looked out of the windows. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with you. It\u2019s my problem. You are a good person.\u201d She paused for a second. \u201cDo you remember what I said to you on the day you fetch me from work? I still have dreams of setting up my own company. I had been working hard for years for this dream. I do not want to be distracted by being in a relationship.Dong Xuebing asked: \u201cSetting up your company? You should need at least 1 million RMB as capital? Is your salary at the newspaper agency enough?\u201dQu Yunxuan kept quiet.Dong Xuebing continued: \u201cYou will not date if you did not accomplish your dream?\u201dQu Yunxuan nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I decided. Sorry.\u201d\u201cThen after you have your own company will you be my girlfriend?\u201d Dong Xuebing asked.Qu Yunxuan\u2019s face turns red and got up. \u201cI will ask the doctor about your condition.\u201dDamn!Was this a success?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Aunt Xuan\u2019s attitude had surprised him.Dong Xuebing noticed that he did not have enough time and immediately shout BACK!\u2026\u2026\u201cGood boy. Have one more bite. Ah\u2026\u2026\u201d Qu Yunxuan was holding the banana towards his mouth.Dong Xuebing took a bite and slowly chewed on the banana.Qu Yunxuan took a napkin and helped him wipe his mouth. \u201cLook at the foolish smile. What are you thinking?\u201d\u201cErrrr, nothing\u2026\u2026 I just feel like smiling. Hahaha.\u201d Dong Xuebing was still not very satisfied with himself. That\u2019s why he still has to use his powers. He still cannot let Aunt Xuan knows that he likes her. He does not want her to feel uncomfortable. He wants to wait until Aunt Xuan have a good impression of him and have a perfect confession. This way, the chances of him succeeding will be higher.But there was a massive hurdle in from of Dong Xuebing.Setting up a company\u2026\u2026 even if Aunt Xuan could get a commission for every advertisement sale, how long will she have to wait to save enough?After thinking for the whole afternoon, Dong Xuebing decided to help Aunt Xuan. If he had the money to help her set up her company, then will the chances of him succeeding higher? Dong Xuebing also wanted to make more money to have a better life. If he could earn 1 million RMB, he would have a better life and might also have a girlfriend. That\u2019s right. Money was also very important in the government sector. Sometimes, he will need to give gifts to his higher-ups. Yes\u2026\u2026 This will be killing 3 birds with one stone.Must make money.Target: 1 million RMBOne day\u2026\u2026Two days\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing was recovering well under the care of Qu Yunxuan. Most of the bandages on his body were removed, and he could move his arm and legs better. Other than strenuous exercise, Dong Xuebing could walk and climb stairs without limping. He asked the doctor when he could be discharged as he was bored staying in the hospital. The doctor told him that he still needs to remain hospitalized for 2 more days for observations. Dong Xuebing wondered if the hospital wants him to say for a few more days was to make money from him.Noon.After eating the hospital lunch, Dong Xuebing listlessly took his medicine.The food at Jiangong Hospital was very cheap. 3 meals for 10 RMB. But the food was only for the patients and not for the family members. Qu Yunxuan had to take her lunch at the nearby restaurants. After her lunch, she bought a packet of yogurt back to the ward and saw Dong Xuebing staring and blowing at the empty plastic lunch container.Qu Yunxuan laughed and placed the yogurt on the table. \u201cAre you retard? How old are you?\u201dDong Xuebing rolled his eyes. \u201cI am bored.\u201d The past two days, Dong Xuebing had been thinking of ways to make more money. But there was nothing he could do in the hospital, and it made him bored.\u201cIf you are bored, then drink this yogurt. Here.\u201d\u201cAunt Xuan, I have recovered. Why don\u2019t you return back to work?\u201d\u201cYour hand still cannot touch the water. If I return back to work, who is going to help you wash your face? Who is going to wash your food containers?\u201d Qu Yunxuan said as she inserts the straw into the yogurt drink. She held it up for Dong Xuebing. \u201cDrink it. If you are really bored, I will accompany you for a walk near the hospital. Where do you want to go?\u201dDong Xuebing was delighted to hear that. \u201cOk. We will just take a walk nearby.\u201d Dong Xuebing does not mind where they were going as long as Aunt Xuan was with him.Half an hour later.Dong Xuebing stood at the west entrance of Jiangong Hospital. He looked at the skies and sighed. \u201cI finally see the skies again.\u201dQu Yunxuan was holding onto him, helping him to walk. Both of them strolled slowly towards the north direction.There was a couple in front playing badminton with their child along the pavement. Qu Yunxuan helped Dong Xuebing walked towards the left of the sidewalk to avoid them. But as they were walking past the family, footsteps were moving closer to their right and knocked into Dong Xuebing\u2019s right shoulders. \u201cOuch!\u201d Dong Xuebing shouted. He could feel the pain in his shoulders, and he turned towards his right. \u201cWatch where you are going!\u201dThe middle age man did not apologize and continued his way.\u201cXiao Bing, are you ok?\u201d Qu Yunxuan nervously asked.Dong Xuebing rubbed his shoulder and replied with a frowned. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dQu Yunxuan was furious. She shouted at the middle-aged man: \u201cHey you! Stop right there!\u201dThe middle-aged man turned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qu Yunxuan angrily replied. \u201cYou had knocked into my brother and can\u2019t you even apologize?\u201dThe middle-aged man who was carrying a leather bag replied impatiently: \u201cI only touched him lightly, why should are you making a fuss?\u201d\u201cMy brother\u2019s shoulder was injured, and you had hurt him.\u201d Qu Yunxuan stared at him and said: \u201cI want you to apologize to him now.\u201dDong Xuebing felt this man looks familiar. He tried to recall who this person was and where did he see him before.The man frowned: \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cYou are the crazy one!\u201d Dong Xuebing was pissed. He points at the man and shouts: \u201cI dare you to say it one more time!\u201dThe man snorted and walked away quickly.Dong Xuebing was furious and walked faster to chase after him. \u201cStop right there!\u201dQu Yunxuan also wanted to chase after that man. But Dong Xuebing had not recovered. She stopped and pull Dong Xuebing back. \u201cForget it. It is pointless to argue with that man.\u201dDong Xuebing looked at the man\u2019s back and suddenly remembered who that man was. \u201cAunt Xuan, I remember who that ma was. I had seen him on TV. He is an antique authenticator from a TV program. His surname is Cheng. The host and guests of the program call him Teacher Cheng. He is an expert in authenticating ancient notes and coins.\u201d Dong Xuebing had worked part-time in the Antique City for some time and was interested in antiques. He often watches these programs in his free time.Qu Yunxuan shook her head. \u201cSuch a rude person can also be an expert?\u201dDong Xuebing also snorted. \u201cHe looks so decent on TV. I didn\u2019t expect his character to be like this in real life.\u201dQu Yunxuan\u2019s phone rang, and she answered. \u201cHello\u2026\u2026 hmmmm\u2026\u2026 yes\u2026\u2026 there is a problem? How come? Then you can speak to him\u2026\u2026 me? I am on leave\u2026\u2026 What did he say? Cannot?\u201d Qu Yunxuan looked at Dong Xuebing. \u201cHow about tomorrow? I will speak to him at his company\u2026\u2026 ok\u2026\u2026 ah\u2026.. must it be today? Wasn\u2019t the project approved?\u201dDong Xuebing knew that it was her work. He said: \u201cYou should go. Your work is more important.\u201dQu Yunxuan hesitated and said: \u201cFine. I will go back to the office in a while. Bye.\u201d\u201cIs it your work at the Advertising division?\u201dQu Yunxuan nodded. \u201cThere are some issues, and they need me to go back and settle it. Sigh\u2026. I can\u2019t even have a peaceful rest on my leave. Let\u2019s go back. I will send you to the hospital first.\u201d\u201cNo. What if you fall down again?\u201d\u201cEh, I am not a kid anymore.\u201d Dong Xuebing walked a few steps quickly. \u201cSee, my leg has healed. You should go now.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d Qu Yunxuan looked at him and swiped Dong Xuebing\u2019s fringe to his side. \u201cThen I will go off. You must take care on your way back. Watch out when you are crossing the roads and watch where you are going. When you are walking up the steps, you must walk slower. Do you hear me?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter Qu Yunxuan left, Dong Xuebing rubbed his aching shoulder.All antique authenticator experts were wealthy, but what\u2019s the use of being wealthy if their characters are like this?That\u2019s right!Antiques!The risk of trading is too high. But I can make money from antiques!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlong the streets.Dong Xuebing was thinking of how to make money with BACK at the Antique City while walking down the underpass back to the hospital. The underpass was damp and reek of urine smell. There were two rows of small stalls in the underpass selling handphone accessories, mini fans, small kitchen tools, etc. Nearer to the stairs, there was a stall selling fruits like pineapples and ice cream. It was bustling with life.\u201cIce cream, 1 RMB for 1. 2 for 1.50!\u201d\u201cCome and take a look! This is the newest peeler. 10 RMB for 1!\u201dDong Xuebing sidestepped to avoid stepping on the radish peels on the floor. When he was about to go to the handphone accessories stall, he saw a familiar back view. It was that middle-aged man who had knocked into him earlier. He was the antique coins and notes authenticator expert, Teacher Cheng. He was walking towards a coin vendor. He bent over and examined the pile of rusty coins at the stall carefully.Dong Xuebing could feel his anger rising when he saw him.Dong Xuebing was standing not far away from Teacher Cheng and could hear him asking. \u201cHow much for these coins?\u201dThe vendor was a young man in his 20s. He was smoking and replied listlessly: \u201c5 RMB for 1 coin.\u201dTeacher Cheng replied: \u201cIt is too expensive.\u201dThe young man did not reply and snubbed his cigarette.Dong Xuebing frowned. When he was working part-time at the Antique City, he had followed his boss to stock up on antiques at the suppliers. The ancient coins were sold by weight. On average, it was a few cents per piece, and almost all the coins were not valuable. This roadside stall\u2019s supplier should be worst than the one Dong Xuebing been to. Those suppliers were cunning and will surely not sell anything good to their customers.What expert is he? Coming to a roadside stall to pick coins?Do you know what you are doing?Dong Xuebing was still thinking about this when he saw Teacher Cheng paused for a while. Huh? What was he doing?That Teacher Cheng quickly picked 8 to 9 rusty copper coins from the pile and sift through them. He held it tightly in his hand and did not put them back into the pile. He continued to search through the pile of over a thousand coins. After searching for a while, he told the stall owner: \u201cI will take these 9 coins. 45 RMB? Take the money.\u201dThe young man looked up and saw him. \u201cRight. 4\u2026\u2026 Eh? You are\u2026\u2026\u201d The young man was stunned for a second. \u201cI have seen you before. You are that expert that appeared on TV. You are an Antique Coins authenticator.\u201d The young man looked at the coins in Teacher Cheng\u2019s hands and immediately said: \u201cSorry, the 5 RMB per coins I said was referring to that pile. The coins you are holding is\u2026\u2026 500 RMB per piece.\u201dTeacher Cheng\u2019s face changed: \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201dThe young man did not reply to him. He knew that the coins picked by the expert should be valuable. Maybe those coins were worth much more.Dong Xuebing was gloating in his heart.But the next moment surprised Dong Xuebing.Teacher Cheng sneered and nodded: \u201c500 RMB? You are too much.\u201dThe young man smiled and reach out to take back the coins in Teacher Cheng\u2019s hand: \u201cYou can choose not to buy it.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Teacher Cheng frowned and kept the coins in his pocket. He took out 4,500 RMB from his wallet and pass it to the young man. \u201cIs this enough?\u201dDong Xuebing, the young man and the rest of the onlookers were stunned.No one expects Teacher Cheng to really buy those coins.Those that knew antiques will know that there was a large number of ancient coins in the market. Most of them were worthless. At most, the coins were worth a few RMB to 20 RMB. But Teacher Cheng was willing to fork out 4,500 RMB for those few coins? He was an expert in ancient coins and should not make this foolish mistake.Let that expert get this bargain?What luck does that Teacher Cheng have? Getting a steal from a roadside stall?Dong Xuebing was pissed. But he suddenly realized something. BACK! BACK! BACK!\u2026\u2026The scenes changed in front of Dong Xuebing.\u201cHow much for these coins?\u201d Teacher Cheng asked while squatting by the roadside stall.The young man was smoking replied without looking up. \u201c:5 RMB for 1 coin.\u201dTeacher Cheng replied: \u201cIt is too expensive.\u201dThe young man did not reply and snubbed his cigarette.Dong Xuebing knew this was the chance to make money. He quickly moves forward. He remembered that Teacher Cheng had picked those few coins from the left corner. Eh, no\u2026 it should be at the bottom of the pile. Huh? That\u2019s not right either. He was moving the coins about, and the position of the coins were all messed up. Dong Xuebing was standing from a distance and could not see the wordings on the coins clearly. Picking those coins from the whole pile was impossible. What should he do? He will be wasting this opportunity?Dong Xuebing suddenly got an idea. He ran to the stall: \u201cBoss.\u201dThe young man got a shock. \u201cWhat do you want? Buy coins?\u201dTeacher Cheng turned at looked at Dong Xuebing before turning back to the pile of coins.Dong Xuebing saw he could not distract Teacher Cheng and he quickly squats down and pushes Teacher Cheng aside. He grabbed the cloth under the coins and carried up the whole pile of coins. \u201cBoss, how many coins do you have here? Over 1,000? Let me estimate the weight.\u201d The bundle of coins was quite heavy.Teacher Cheng was pissed. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? I am still picking the coins.\u201dDong Xuebing scoffed. \u201cSo what? Have you paid for the coins?\u201dThe young man asked puzzledly: \u201cWhy are you estimating the weight? There are about 1,300 to 1,400 coins. Put the coins down. The other customer still has not finished picking.\u201dDong Xuebing replied to that young man. \u201cHow about this? I am lazy to count the exact number of coins. I will buy all the coins in this bundle. How much?\u201dThe young man and Teacher Cheng looked at Dong Xuebing in shock. \u201cAl the coins?\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Name a price.\u201dThe young man was overjoyed: \u201cIf you are getting everything, I will give you a discount. 5 RMB per coin and 1,300 coins cost 6,500 RMB. I will sell everything to you for 6,000 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing held the bundle of coins tightly: \u201c6,000 RMB is too expensive. How about 4,000 RMB?\u201dThe young man replied: \u201cMy cost is also very high. I can\u2019t sell it to you any cheaper. Errr\u2026\u2026 Fine\u2026\u2026 let\u2019s meet in the middle. 5,000 RMB? I will just earn lesser.\u201d\u201cFine\u2026\u2026\u201dThe young man was ecstatic. He had set up this stall for more than a year, and he finally met a sucker.Teacher Cheng scoffed at Dong Xuebing and walked away. He was thinking in his heart that Dong Xuebing was a novice in antiques. Dong Xuebing had not even looked at the coins and bought all the coins. Was he crazy?Dong Xuebing did not have so much cash with him. The young man followed him with the bundle of coins to a nearby ICBC ATM. Dong Xuebing withdrew 5,000 RMB and passed it to the young man. He looked at his bank account balance. There was only a few hundred left. But Dong Xuebing was still feeling great. He carried the big bundle of coins back to the hospital.Hahaha\u2026\u2026.So, BACK can be used like this\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He dropped the big bundle of coins on the floor beside his bed, in front of the old man and his son. Clink\u2026\u2026 Clank\u2026\u2026 the coins made a loud noise as it was dropped on the floor.The old man was stunned: \u201cWhat are you doing, young man?\u201dThe tired Dong Xuebing turned to him and smiled: \u201cI bought some ancient coins.\u201dThe old man\u2019s son said. \u201cYou also do not need to buy so many coins.\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026\u2026 I am just buying these coins for fun.\u201d Dong Xuebing saw the old man\u2019s son\u2019s Samsung laptop beside his bed. He asked: \u201cBrother, I saw you surfing the net yesterday. Are you using the 3G network? If you are not using the laptop now, can I use it?\u201dThe old man\u2019s son generously pushed his laptop towards Dong Xuebing: \u201cSure. Use it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Your Aunt had helped my father get water and wash his trays when I was not around. I still need to thank her.\u201dTo prevent the nurses and doctors from gossiping about him, Dong Xuebing did not dare to pour all the coins out. He placed the bundle of coins at a corner beside his bed and took out the coins bit by bit to count them. After counting the coins, Dong Xuebing was pissed. What 1,400 coins? There were not even 1,000 coins in the bundle. Damn.Dong Xuebing switched on the laptop and connect to the internet. He starts to look at the pictures of ancient coins on the net and match it to the coins.He was not an expert on antique appraising and had to rely on the internet.5 minutes\u2026\u202610 minutes\u2026\u202620 minutes\u2026\u2026As Dong Xuebing examines each and every coin, he realized that there was a vast variety of coins in the bundle.There were Chong Ning Zhong Bao, Kai Yuen Tong Bao, Xuan He Tong Bao, metal and copper coins mixed in the bundle.Dong Xuebing starts to read up about coins collection on a few websites and forums, at the same time he was sorting out the coins. Those that were more prominent were easily picked out. He sorts it according to the dynasty like Song, Tang and by the types of coins. Most of the coins were not worth much. At most, it was worth a few RMB per coin. Some does not even have value.Dong Xuebing picked those worthless coins and placed it into another bag.1 coin\u2026\u202610 coins\u2026\u202650 coins\u2026\u2026This was tiring and tedious work. It needs lots of patients.After sorting the coins for the whole afternoon, the meal trolley appeared outside the ward. It was dinner time.Dong Xuebing took a break and ate his dinner. After dinner, he continued to sieve through the coins.330 coins\u2026\u2026350 coins\u2026\u2026410 coins\u2026\u2026He had sorted more than 500 worthless coins. There were only about 300 coins left.At 7.30pm, Qu Yunxuan called Dong Xuebing and told him that she was still at work. She will not be able to visit him this evening. She will drop by tomorrow morning. Dong Xuebing asked her not to come if she was busy. But Qu Yunxuan does not listen and hang up.That night, the old man\u2019s son did not leave the ward. He remained in the ward to accompany his father. Dong Xuebing asked his permission to continue using his laptop. The son was generous and told him to carry on using and no need to worry about the internet charges. He can get reimbursement from his company. Dong Xuebing thanked him again. He made a mental note to buy a laptop in the future.Dong Xuebing was an impatient person and does not like to leave things for tomorrow. He decided to sieve through the coins all night. He can\u2019t sleep unless he found all the valuable coins.So, he carries on with the tiresome task\u2026\u2026.580 Coins\u2026\u2026650 coins\u2026\u2026670 coins\u2026\u2026The remaining coins were not quickly sorted. For example, Chong Ning Zhong Bao. This type of coin has several variations. It comes in different scripts and had different dominations. It was hard to tell the differences.Dong Xuebing starts to check the coins one by one with the pictures on the internet.Hmmm\u2026\u2026 This coin is from the Qing Dynasty. There is a large number of this coin circulating in the market. Pass\u2026\u2026Oh, this coin is chipped, and it was too rusty. Even if this type of coins were valuable, it will also not fetch a high price. Pass\u2026\u2026Another 3 hours passed. He still did not find any valuable coins.At about 1 am, Dong Xuebing yawned and was about to give up. He noticed a rusty copper coin among the remaining coins. This coin is called \u201cJiading Yuanbao\u201d. He checked on the internet, and there were all sorts of value for this coin. The value differs by the year the coin was produced and the size. The difference was wide. Dong Xuebing took the coin and try to match it to the descriptions on the website. Not this\u2026.. Not this one either\u2026\u2026 It does not match this too\u2026\u2026After scanning through all the pictures on the website, he could not see any coins that look like the one he was holding.He went to another website and try to identify the coin in his hand. He chanced upon an auction website and saw a description of a coin that matches the one he in his hand.Southern Song dynasty, Jiading Yuanbao, 10 cash. Square hole and diameter 54 millimeters.From the picture, the color, wordings, and diameter were almost exactly the same as the coin he was holding. The only difference was the picture in the auction site was perfect. There was no rust on the coin. Dong Xuebing\u2019s coin was slightly rusty.Dong Xuebing scrolled up and look at the transacted price. He was stunned.Starting price: 30,000 RMB.Transacted price: 62,000 RMB.Damn! The price is high!Yes! This must be the coin.This must be one of the coins picked by Teacher Cheng!Dong Xuebing took in a deep breath. He stared at the transacted price on the website. He thought the coins would worth about 8,000 to 10,000 RMB. Who would expect a coin to worth more than 60,000 RMB? Wait\u2026\u2026 The prices at auctions should be higher as there were still commissions and charges. The real value should be lower than 60,000 RMB. Could this coin a fake coin? Many counterfeit coins were circulating around. But this should not be. Although Teacher Cheng was an asshole, he was an expert in ancient coins.Dong Xuebing put the coin aside and continue to check the remaining coins on the internet.The remaining coins were only worth 1 to 2 RMB each.Dong Xuebing wrapped all the coins with the cloth into a bundle and stuff it under his bed. He took out the Jiading Yuanbao coin to examine it closer. That Teacher Cheng must have picked those 9 coins yesterday to deceive others. Jiading Yuanbao should be the only coin he wanted.Hahaha\u2026\u2026. I can see the money already\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He rubbed his eyes and got off the bed. He went to bed in the early hours after sieving through all the coins. The mosquitos at the hospital were very poisonous. Once bitten, it will swell, and it was painful and itchy. Dong Xuebing could hardly fall asleep with the mosquitos flying around him. In his mind, he was thinking about the ancient coin and had a dream where he was buried alive by tons of coins.\u201cYou are awake?\u201d The old man\u2019s son asked. He was already dressed up and sitting beside his father.Dong Xuebing smiled embarrassedly: \u201cSorry to disturb you all last night.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We are just wondering why you bought so many coins back.\u201d The old man\u2019s son asked. \u201cI heard that many experts nowadays could not tell the difference between authentic and counterfeit coins. You must be careful not to be tricked. There are counterfeits everywhere.\u201dDong Xuebing chatted with them for a while and returned the laptop. There were risks when dealing with antiques. Dong Xuebing knew about the risks the first day he started working at the Antique City. But now, with his ability, BACK, he could still make some profits with antiques.Dong Xuebing needs to be on a drip at 8 am. But he secret leave the hospital before Aunt Xuan visits him.He carried a big bundle of coins and took a taxi to the famous Liu Li Chang.The renovated Liu Li Chang was a crowded place with a traditional feel. The only thing Dong Xuebing does not like was the road. It should restrict vehicles from entering the area. Lots of luxurious cars were parked along the street on both sides, leaving little space for pedestrians.There are so many antique shops here. Which should I go?Dong Xuebing decided to go to the shop Rong Bao Zhai near the entrance of Liu Li Chang.After entering the shop, Dong Xuebing walked past a Caucasian and asked the shop assistant where the coins and notes counter was. That shop assistant pointed to a corner of the shop. Dong Xuebing thanked him and went to the counter. He saw a middle-aged man reading newspapers behind the counter. \u201cExcuse me, do you buy antique coins?\u201dThe middle-aged man lowered his papers and saw Dong Xuebing\u2019s huge bundle. \u201cSo many coins?\u201dDong Xuebing rubbed his nose and smiled. \u201cNo. You can just give me a price for this bundle. What I really want to sell is this Jiading Yuanbao coin.\u201dThe man nodded and put his newspaper aside. He took out a magnifying glass and some small tools from the drawer. \u201cOk, let me take a look first.\u201d\u201cOk. Here is the coin.\u201d Dong Xuebing passed him the coin.Please\u2026\u2026 Please\u2026\u2026The coin must be genuine\u2026\u2026 Please let the coin be authentic\u2026\u2026The middle-aged man scrutinized the coin.1 second passed\u2026\u20262 seconds passed\u2026\u20263 seconds passed\u2026\u2026The man suddenly grasped. He moved closer to take a better look at the coin and had a shocked expression. \u201cThis coin\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing asked anxiously: \u201cHow is the coin?\u201d\u201cWait. I need to take a closer look.\u201d The man sat upright and carefully examine every detail of the coin and nodded. \u201cThis coin is scarce. Young man, this is a 10 cash Southern Song Dynasty Jiading Yuanbao coin. It is produced in the year 1208, and it is still in good condition. It is rare to see this coin even in the auctions. It is very rare and valuable. You see this rust color? It shows the age of the coin.\u201dHahaha, the coin was indeed genuine!!Dong Xuebing cleared his throat and asked. \u201cHow much are you willing to offer for this coin?\u201d\u201cErrrmmm\u2026\u2026\u201d The man hesitated. \u201cYoung man, you should have done your homework before coming here with the coin. So, I will not cheat you. This coin can fetch up to 60,000 RMB at the auctions. But after commissions and charges\u2026\u2026 The highest I can offer is 50,000 RMB. What do you think?\u201dDong Xuebing felt this was a good offer. He thought for a while and nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201dThe middle age man laughed. \u201cGreat. Since you are so forthright, I will give you 1,000 for that bundle of coins. Ok?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d50,000 RMB!Two years of his mother\u2019s salaries do not even amount to 50,000 RMB.For Dong Xuebing, 50,000 RMB was an astronomical amount.Dong Xuebing hugged a brown colored envelope tightly as he walked out of Rong Bao Zhai. He was afraid someone would jump out and snatched his money. He scanned his surroundings carefully and quickly ran across the road to the ICBC bank. He deposited all the money into his account, and his balance suddenly became more than 51,000 RMB. With this amount, he could even afford to buy a low-cost car. He very excited as he returned back to the hospital.Yay! I\u2019m rich!50,000 RMB!!!Orthopedic ward.Dong Xuebing returned to his ward to find the nurse and Aunt Xuan staring at him angrily.Aunt Xuan scolded: \u201cWhere did you go so early in the morning and why didn\u2019t you switch on your phone? Do you know I am worried for you?\u201d She was holding on to the drip bottle. \u201cThe nurses have come here looking for you several times. You are supposed to be on a drip. How can you sneak out without a word?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled apologetically: \u201cYou did not help me bring the charger. My battery had been dead a long time ago.\u201dQu Yunxuan stared at him: \u201cSo you are telling me that it is my fault?\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing quickly poured a glass of water for Aunt Xuan. \u201cI am bored this morning and went out for a walk. I forgot the time and came back late. I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t be angry with me.\u201d He does not intend to tell Aunt Xuan about the antique coin. He wanted to give her a surprise.Qu Yunxuan calmed down. \u201cHurry and get back on your bed. You need to be on a drip.\u201dDong Xuebing took off his slippers and got back on his bed obediently. He extended his hand for the nurse to insert the needle. As the nurse inserts the needle, he shouted: \u201cOuch, ouch\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s painful\u2026\u2026 be gentler with the needle.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed at him and playfully smacked his forehead. \u201cDo you dare to sneak out without telling anyone again?\u201d Aunt Xuan was wearing a light colored spaghetti strap top and white jeans. Her top was showing some cleavage, and her tight jeans outlined her shapely legs.Dong Xuebing was mesmerized by her figure. He was determined to make money for her.Aunt Xuan, wait for me. I will help you raise enough money to set up your own company. I will help you achieve your dreams.Yes\u2026\u2026 I should also work hard to achieve my goal of becoming a top official too.Earn money and getting promoted!!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was the third day of the National Day holidays.State Security is different from the rest of the government agencies. Other than National Day, the staffs had to work on Oct 2nd and 3rd in shifts. Everyone had to return to work on 4th Oct. Today was Dong Xuebing could rest before he returns to work. He returned home with Qu Yunxuan and saw his small one-bedroom apartment. He got the familiar feeling as he sat on his couch.Aunt Xuan helped him keep all his belongs: \u201cHehe\u2026\u2026 The home still feel the best?\u201dDong Xuebing replied. \u201cOf course. I am almost going bonkers at the hospital. It was so boring!\u201d\u201cOk. I had escorted you safely back home, and I should go. I still must work overtime during the holidays.\u201d Qu Yunxuan helped Dong Xuebing pour a cup of hot tea and pinched his cheeks playfully: \u201cSister Luan is not returning back to Beijing for the holidays? Then you stay at home alone. If you need anything, just send me a message. Don\u2019t go out by yourself and wait at home for me. Bye.\u201d\u201cOk. Bye.\u201dClicked. The door closes.Dong Xuebing had fully recovered from his injuries. He got up and wanted to cook a bowl of egg tomato soup. But after the soup was cooked, he discovered he had run out of vinegar. He finished his soup and took the empty bottle to the supermarket nearby. While walking to the supermarket, he thought back on how Aunt Xuan took care of him the past few days, and he smiled.Was there anyone else that\u2019s as virtuous as Aunt Xuan in this world?Was there anyone else that\u2019s as pretty as Aunt Xuan in this world?No.There\u2019s no one else as virtuous and pretty as her.Dong Xuebing was still letting his imaginations run wild when he saw a stunning beauty appearing in his sights. He was shocked. He looked at that slim figure. The woman was standing under a tree using her phone. Her hair was tied into a bun and was wearing a suit. Her eyes were a crescent shape with long lashes and had a small face which was beautiful beyond words.There\u2019s really someone as pretty as Aunt Xuan.Dong Xuebing took in a deep breath. He was a normal man and likes to look at pretty women. He pretended to be waiting for someone and kept stealing glances at that woman. The woman should be about slightly older than him. She looked mature, and her movements were graceful.Many passers-by also notice this beautiful woman and all of them were looking at her.Dong Xuebing noticed a skinny man walked past that woman and stopped behind her. He seems to be looking at the woman carefully.This graceful woman ignored everyone\u2019s looks and continued to smile and talks on the phone: \u201cOld Zhou, it is not that I am not helping you\u2026\u2026 It is beyond my ability to help\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 You can ask Xiao An. He is close to Minister Zhao. Ok?\u201d After talking on the phone for a while, she hung up and kept the phone into her opened handbag. She turned and walked away in her back heels.Dong Xuebing took his eyes off her and start walking back towards his home.Sigh\u2026\u2026 All he could do was to look at the woman from far. He knew he was not good enough for this type of women.After taking two steps, Dong Xuebing heard a sweet woman\u2019s voice: \u201cEh? Where is my wallet?\u201d Dong Xuebing turned around and saw the woman searching her handbag. She then looked around on the ground.A kind old lady went up to her and asked: \u201cYou can\u2019t find your wallet? Did you drop it somewhere?\u201dThe woman frowned: \u201cI should not have dropped it. It was still in my bag 2 minutes ago when I was on the phone.\u201d\u201cOh, then your wallet should be stolen.\u201d2 minutes ago?Dong Xuebing paused. He remembered that skinny man standing very close to her when she was on the phone just now. He stopped beside her for about 2 seconds. Damn! That was a pickpocket?BACK!\u2026\u2026Time returns back to 1 minute ago.The woman was still on the phone under the tree.\u201cOld Zhou, it is not that I am not helping you\u2026\u2026 It is beyond my ability to help\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 You can ask Xiao An. He is close to Minister Zhao. Ok?\u201d The woman was smiling as she talks on the phone. 2 meters from her, the skinny man walked away from her quickly with his hands covering his stomach.Dong Xuebing put down his bottle of vinegar on the floor and ran over.The bystanders were looking at him as he tried to make as little noise as he ran. When he was closer to the skinny man, he pounced onto him. \u201cStop!\u201dThe skinny man fell onto the floor and shouted: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing? You should know what I am doing. Where is the wallet?\u201d Dong Xuebing got into a tussle with that man.The skinny man was very confident of his pickpocketing skills. He thought no one would know he had taken that woman\u2019s wallet. But this man exposed him and was very sure that he had stolen the wallet. The skinny man was shocked and frightened. He quickly broke off Dong Xuebing\u2019s grip and threw a leather wallet on the floor before running away.Dong Xuebing saw that man had left the wallet behind and did not give chase. That skinny man might have accomplices around, and Dong Xuebing might be ambushed or stabbed if he gave chase.That beautiful woman looked at Dong Xuebing puzzledly. She still does not understand why this young man got into a fight with that skinny man. But when she saw the wallet in Dong Xuebing\u2019s hand, she was stunned. She immediately hangs up the phone and checks her handbag.Dong Xuebing got up from the floor and walked over to pass the wallet back to that pretty woman. \u201cThat man had stolen your wallet.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d The woman took the wallet from Dong Xuebing and shook his hand. \u201cI was on the phone and did not notice it. Thank you. Are you hurt?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Dong Xuebing shook her hand. His heart had skipped a beat.The woman looks prettier closer. It\u2019s hard to find words to describe her beauty.After some pleasantries, the woman\u2019s handphone rang again. She thanked Dong Xuebing again. \u201cI still have something to attend to. Give me your number, and I will treat you to dinner some other day.\u201d From her tone, this woman seems like a leader at her workplace. The way she speaks was commanding.Dong Xuebing had wanted to reject her offer, but he could not resist her charms. He told her his mobile number.The woman took out a notebook and jotted down his number. \u201cOk. I will contact you another day. Bye.\u201dDong Xuebing was still in a daze as he looked at that woman walked away.Sigh\u2026\u2026 Whoever that marries her must be blessed by all his ancestors.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dong Xuebing became a Probationary member of the Communist Party of China (CPC).After leaving the meeting room, Li Qing patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s shoulders and asked him to go to his office. \u201cMy former office could not be used anymore. This is my new office. If you need to look for me, just drop by. Xiao Dong, you must not strain yourself. If you are still not recovered, you can rest for a few more days. But you do look better now compared to the time you were at the hospital.\u201d Zhou Changchun also entered the office. He smiled: \u201cThese few days Xiao Dong will only deliver some documents. Leave the strenuous work to others.\u201dDong Xuebing replied with a grateful expression on his face: \u201cThank you, leaders. I will do my best.\u201dLi Qing nodded. \u201cGood. But don\u2019t push yourself too hard.\u201dThe sick looking Zhou Changchun also patted Dong Xuebing on his shoulders.\u201cOld Zhou.\u201d Li Qing looked at him. \u201cYou need to take care of your health too. You are looking pale recently.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u2026 This is an old problem, and there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dDong Xuebing excused himself as he could tell Li Qing and Zhou Changchun had something to discuss.After saving the documents from the fire, Li Qing and Zhou Changchun trust in Dong Xuebing increased a lot.This was a good sign.Dong Xuebing happily return to the General Affairs Office. Everyone was around. Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi were photocopying some documents at the copier and chatting at the same time. Changjuan and Old Yan were hiding behind their monitors. One was reading a woman\u2019s magazine, and the other was reading his newspaper. Guo Shunjie was nodding off at his desk, and Guo Panwei was writing a report with his right hand and massaging his thighs with his left.Old Yan was the first person to notice Dong Xuebing. He lowered his newspaper: \u201cOh, Xiao Dong, you are back to work?\u201dEveryone looked up. Tan Limei smiled and waved to him. \u201cBing Zhi, congratulations for entering the party and being discharged from the hospital.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dChangjuan asked: \u201cOur great hero is back. How are your injuries?\u201d\u201cI am fine. Thanks for asking.\u201d Dong Xuebing moved his arms, showing that he had recovered.Although Guo Panwei was jealous of Dong Xuebing, he still showed his concerns: \u201cXiao Dong, take care not to get your wounds wet if it is not healed yet.\u201dThe only one who did not speak to Dong Xuebing was Guo Shunjie. Both of them had fallen out before the fire. He only took a glance at Dong Xuebing and continued dozing off.After chatting with his colleagues for a while, Dong Xuebing returned to his seat and start to work. He noticed a strange sign. Not only Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie were listless, but even the big sized Zhuang Zhi also looks tired. They look liked they had just finished some strenuous exercises. When Zhuang Zhi went over to Tan Limei at the copier machine, Dong Xuebing also followed. He asked: \u201cZhuang Zhi, what\u2019s wrong with you? What did you do yesterday?\u201d Dong Xuebing asked and winked at Tan Limei.Tan Limei blushed. \u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cNothing.\u201d He felt that something was going on between both of them. Could they be dating?Zhuang Zhi coughed and said. \u201cBing Zhi, stop making random guesses. I am tired because of the soccer matches these few days.\u201d\u201cSoccer match?\u201d\u201cYes. Our City\u2019s State Security Soccer competition.\u201d Zhuang Zhi explained. \u201cI heard that the District Bureaus held competitions every year. But unlike the previous years, where the competitions were held within the district bureaus, this year we have a combined competition. All of Beijing\u2019s district branch bureaus must send a team each to participate. The competition had started before the National Day. Yesterday, we had a match against Miyun branch, and we lose 5-0.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. \u201cNo wonder all of you look so tired.\u201dTan Limei loves to chat. She added: \u201cLuckily you are not at work. I tell you, our team play is too dirty\u2026\u2026.\u201d She looked over at Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie and lowered her voice: \u201cDirtier than the toilets. If it weren\u2019t for Zhuang Zhi, yesterday\u2019s match would have ended 6-0.\u201dDong Xuebing laughed. \u201cEveryone here is amateurs. Win or lose still depends a lot on luck.\u201d\u201cBullshit.\u201d Tan Limei pouted. \u201cThe other teams played well. Their forwards were forwards, and defenders were defenders. Look at our team. At the start of the match, our formation was still fine. But as the match continues, all of our forwards became defenders. I was still cheering for them with my friends from the Finance Department. It was so embarrassing.\u201dZhuang Zhi thought Tan Limei was angry with him and quickly said: \u201cI will perform better in the next match.\u201dTan Limei rolled her eyes. \u201cOther than playing dirty by knocking other players down, what else can you do? You can\u2019t even run.\u201dZhuang Zhi replied embarrassedly: \u201cI\u2026\u2026 I am already trying to lose weight.\u201d\u201cCough\u2026\u2026 Errrr\u2026\u2026 Tan Zhi, Zhuang Zhi, are both of you dating?\u201d Dong Xuebing asked.Zhuang Zhi panicked: \u201cI\u2026\u2026 We\u2026\u2026\u201dTan Limei blushed and stared at Dong Xuebing: \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dReally? Dong Xuebing said: \u201cIf I don\u2019t ask the both of you, are you two going to keep it from me? Don\u2019t worry. I will keep my mouth shut. When did both of you start? Have you met the parents? How far have the both of you going?\u201d Dong Xuebing was happy for them as a friend. At the same time, he was also envious of them. Sigh\u2026\u2026 How long do I need to wait to be dating?\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhuang Zhi does not know what to said and quickly returned to his desk with his documents.Tan Limei also took a set of printouts and smacked Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm. \u201cYou want to die, is it? Why are you so nosey? Hmph! If you want to know gossips, I can tell you the hottest gossip in our bureau.\u201d She changed the subject. \u201cDo you know? When you are still in the hospital, rumors about you spread because of your bravery. You got a nickname. Firefighter.\u201dDong Xuebing was surprised. \u201cHuh? Firefighter?\u201d\u201cHehe. Sounds good?\u201d Tan Limei laughed. \u201cWhen Li Qing and Zhou Changchun heard your nickname, they also said that it suits you well. Not only you saved the documents, but you also save everyone by writing the speech for Deputy Bureau Chief Yang. Don\u2019t you think this is a good nickname for you? You can take on whatever issues we have. I think almost all the deputy chiefs of the General Affairs division knows about your nickname. Maybe even the Deputy Bureau Chiefs also know about the firefighter from the General Affairs Office.\u201dA firefighter has several meanings to it.Dong Xuebing smiled: \u201cWho was the one that came up with this name? It does not sound nice.\u201dTan Limei replied uninterestedly: \u201cDon\u2019t lie. You are feeling pleased now, right?\u201dTan Limei was right. Dong Xuebing was feeling pleased. This was the recognition given to him by the leaders and colleagues.Hah! If I continue what I am doing, I should be up for promotion!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hahaha!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201dAfter a short chat, it was time to work. Zhou Changchun did not come to work today. No one had seen him since yesterday afternoon. Maybe he was on sick leave again. After all, Zhou Changchun had cerebrovascular diseases and other chronic illness. His health had been in bad shape. Without anyone supervising in the office, everyone was not doing their work. Guo Panwei was looking at the stock market. Guo Shunjie was surfing some forums on the internet. Most of the work in the office was done by Tan Limei, Dong Xuebing, and Zhuang Zhi.\u201cChief Zhou had taken dozens of days of medical leave this year.\u201d Tan Limei grumbled.Dong Xuebing was shocked. \u201cSo many days?\u201dTan Limei replied: \u201cIt is considered not a lot. Last year was also the same. When Chief Zhou was not around, my workload increases a lot. Luckily you and Zhuang Zhi are around this year. If not, I can\u2019t cope with all the work.\u201d She looked at Guo Shunjie and the rest. \u201cClinging to a post without doing any work!\u201dDong Xuebing laughed. \u201cI think Chief Zhou will be back tomorrow. Let me help you with the printing.\u201dDuring lunchtime, they received news that Zhou Changchun was hospitalized for his cerebrovascular illness.This was not surprising by many of them. They were used to it.Guo Panwei immediately goes and ask which hospital and ward Zhou Changchun was in. \u201cI will go and visit Chief Zhou.\u201d\u201cI will go too.\u201d Dong Xuebing does not want to be left behind. Although he was now much closer to Zhou Changchun but visiting him at the hospital will leave a good impression with the leader. The leader will not think: I am in the hospital, and you do not even visit me? What are you thinking?Guo Shunjie and Changjuan also wanted to do. In the end, all of them went to Youyi Hospital in two taxis.Neurology ward\u201cChief Zhou, how are you feeling?\u201d\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201dZhou Changchun was lying in bed. He looked several years older since he last appeared in the office a few days earlier. He does not look well. His wife was beside him clearing his lunch box. She forced a smile as Dong Xuebing, and the rest entered the ward. She put the fruits and flowers by the window and let them sit beside the Zhou Changchun.\u201cAll of you are here?\u201d Zhou Changchun sighed. \u201cI am fine. But I should not be able to return to work these few days.\u201dChangjuan pretended to be sad: \u201cChief Zhou, we will be lost if you are not in the office leading us.\u201dGuo Panwei also pretended to be nice. He turned to Zhou Changchun\u2019s wife: \u201cAuntie, if you need any help, let me know. I can stay behind in the afternoon to help you take care of Chief Zhou.\u201dZhou Changchun\u2019s wife replied. \u201cThank you. But I can still cope.\u201dZhou Changchun waved his hand. \u201cNo need to stay behind to accompany me. Go back to work. There are lots of work waiting for you all in the office.\u201d His condition was quite serious. He even had difficulties walking to the bathroom. His wife had to help him walk. Seems like he could not return to work soon.After chatting for a while with Zhou Changchun, Dong Xuebing and the rest were about to return to the office.But Zhou Changchun hesitated for a while and called out: \u201cPanwei, Xiao Bing, I want to talk to you two.\u201dGuo Shunjie glanced at Dong Xuebing and Guo Panwei before walking away. Tan Limei, Changjuan, and Zhuang Zhi also walked out of the ward. All of them knew that Guo Panwei and Dong Xuebing held a higher status in Chief Zhou\u2019s heart. Dong Xuebing had helped Zhou Changchun rescued the important documents. Guo Panwei had been loyal to Zhou Changchun for years and had been his right-hand man.In the ward, Guo Panwei and Dong Xuebing looked at each other. They were standing there waiting for Zhou Changchun to speak.But Zhou Changchun kept quiet for a while before he sighed. \u201cThe both of you are my most trusted subordinates. In the future\u2026\u2026\u201d He paused for a while before continuing. \u201cIn the future\u2026\u2026. Work hard.\u201d Dong Xuebing and Guo Panwei were wondering what Zhou Changchun was trying to say. Zhou Changchun waved his hand. \u201cGo back. My wife will send you out.\u201dZhou Changchun walked them out to the corridor.Dong Xuebing turned to her and said: \u201cAuntie, there\u2019s no need to walk us out.\u201dZhou Changchun\u2019s wife seems like she had lots of things to say to them. But in the end, she only said: \u201cPlease take care of the General Affairs Office in the future.\u201dGuo Panwei immediately replied: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will do our work well.\u201dDong Xuebing felt something was off. It seems that the husband and wife were implying something.Back at the office, Dong Xuebing carried on with his work as usual.At about 1pm, Guo Shunjie suddenly received a phone call and started to do his work seriously. He did his own photocopying and offered to deliver documents. After a while, Guo Panwei who returned from outside behaved the same way as Guo Shunjie. They started to do their work eagerly with a smile on their faces. Guo Panwei even threw all his stock market graphs and charts away.Dong Xuebing was confused. He asked Zhuang Zhi: \u201cWhat happened?\u201dZhuang Zhi looked at both of them: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s time for our increments?\u201dChangjuan and Old Yan were also confused.Just before they finished work, Tan Limei who returned from the Political Section Office told them a piece of shocking news. \u201cHey, hey, have you all heard the news?\u201dDong Xuebing asked: \u201cWhat news?\u201dZhuang Zhi scratched his head: \u201cAre we getting a raise?\u201d\u201cYou wish!\u201d Tan Limei rolled her eyes at him. \u201cIt\u2019s about Chief Zhou. Chief Zhou will be retiring due to his illness.\u201d Tan Limei\u2019 words attracted the attention of Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi. \u201cI heard this news from the Political Section, and they told me that the next Chief will be selected from one of us in the office.\u201dDong Xuebing was shocked: \u201cIs this real?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Changjuan exclaimed: \u201cChief Zhou has not reached the retirement age yet. Is his illness so serious?\u201dTan Limei lowered her voice: \u201cI heard two versions. One was the leaders were unhappy with Chief Zhou for taking so many days of medical leave. The other rumor is about Chief Zhou\u2019s finances. I heard that there were some issues with his finances and he was \u201coffered\u201d to retire. It was not voluntary. If it were, Chief Zhou would have told us just now at the hospital.\u201dFinance issues?Corruption?This was a piece of alarming news. Old Yan heard this and paused for a while before continuing reading his papers.The two Guos should have received this news earlier. No wonder they suddenly became so hardworking.No matter Chief Zhou was forced to retire or retired voluntary, the position of Deputy Chief was up for grabs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Give it to me.\u201d Guo Shunjie said.After both of them finished speaking, they stared at each other. It was tense. After the news of Chief Zhou\u2019s retirement was made known, Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie were competing for the position. Guo Shunjie used his bootlicking skills to \u201creport his work status\u201d with almost all the leaders in the District Branch Bureau. Especially the Chief of the Political Section and the District Bureau Chief. Guo Shunjie used a different tactic. He targeted other higher-ups. He tried his best to perform in front of the other leaders of the General Affairs Department and start to contact the District Political Commissar more often. They were working all their means to get the position of Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office.On the other side.Old Yan was still acting normally. He was still drinking his tea and reading his newspapers. He does not seem to be interested in the Deputy Chief\u2019s position. Changjuan was also about the same as before. But compared to last time, she chatted more often with Guo Shunjie. She should be placing her money on Guo Shunjie.\u201cZhuang Zhi.\u201d When the two Guos left, Tan Limei cheerfully asked: \u201cWho do you think will become the Deputy Chief?\u201dZhuang Zhi was a bit slow when replying. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. But isn\u2019t everyone in the office had the chance of being promoted?\u201dTan Limei rolled her eyes at him: \u201cAre you stupid? Never mind. Bing Zhi, who do you think?\u201dDong Xuebing replied listlessly. \u201cThe 3 of us does not stand a chance.\u201d\u201cYou are speaking the obvious.\u201d Tan Limei laughed. \u201cIf one of us were picked to be the Deputy Chief, the sun will rise from the west tomorrow. Bing Zhi, you seem like you also want to be promoted. Hehe\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t overthink. We are still young. In another 3 to 5 years, it might be our turn to move up.\u201dZhuang Zhi scratched the back of his head: \u201cActually I think Bing Zhi is the one most suitable to be promoted.\u201dDong Xuebing laughed: \u201cStop talking nonsense. I know my limits.\u201dTan Limei also laughed: \u201cTo be honest, Bing Zhi is suitable. But the Government sector is different from private companies. Those with capabilities might not be promoted. The length of services and connections is the main criteria.\u201dDong Xuebing also knew about this.After a while, Guo Panwei returned. He was walking with his head held high and smiling. Some leaders must have told him he stood a good chance and boosted his confidence. \u201cOld Yan, stop reading the papers. Xiao Sun, the water dispenser is empty. Call someone to bring a bottle of water up. Later someone will be dropping by the office. All of you better work hard and don\u2019t disgrace our office.\u201d A bootlicker who was always hanging around the leaders saying such things made the rest of them uncomfortable.Dong Xuebing cursed him in his heart.A few minutes later, Guo Shunjie returned to the office and looked at Guo Panwei briefly before clapping his hand together to get the attention of everyone. \u201cThere is a meeting at 1.30 pm. Finish your lunch and be back earlier to prepare for the meeting. Xiao Dong, Xiao Sun, the both of you go and clean up the meeting room on the third floor. Xiao Tan, you are in charge of the materials and documents for the meeting. Ok. That\u2019s it. Carry on with your work.\u201dDong Xuebing was pissed. Both of them were not promoted, and they were already giving out orders. What would happen if they were really promoted?Seeing Dong Xuebing still sitting at his desk, Guo Shunjie\u2019s face turns dark. \u201cDid you not hear what I just said?\u201d Guo Shunjie was 90% sure he would be promoted. Without Zhou Changchun around, he was no afraid of Dong Xuebing. After staying low for the past few days, he became arrogant again.Dong Xuebing frowned and replied coldly. \u201cNo.\u201dGuo Shunjie was furious: \u201cFine\u2026\u2026 fine\u2026\u2026\u201d He walked over to Dong Xuebing and said softly: \u201cWait until I become the Chief and you will get it. Just wait\u2026.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cYa\u2026. I\u2019m waiting.\u201dGuo Shunjie: \u201cHmph!\u201dNoon.During lunch, Tan Limei pouted and looked at Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei who were sitting at their tables not far away. \u201cDid you see it? They are not even promoted, and they are already acting as leaders. Even when Chief Zhou was not as commanding as them. Hmph! I want to see what they will do if they are not promoted.\u201dDong Xuebing took a big bite off his bun: \u201cThat\u2019s right. But there is no one else competing with them for the position. The next Deputy Chief of our office will surely be the surname Guo.\u201dZhuang Zhi quickly shushed them: \u201cLower your voices. Don\u2019t let others hear you.\u201dTan Limei angrily said: \u201cThis is so unfair. Bing Zhi will be in trouble this time. No matter which one of them became our chief, they will be looking for trouble with Bing Zhi.\u201dDong Xuebing waved his hand and sighed. \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201dDong Xuebing had analyzed the situation last night. The position of Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office will definitely be out of reach for the 3 of them. He and Zhuang Zhi had only joined the office for less than 2 months. They were considered newbies. The Government sector focuses more on seniority than ability. Even if Dong Xuebing did one or two more outstanding performances, it was also useless. It was the same for Tan Limei. She had joined the State Security one year earlier than them. She was still considered too junior.Old Yan had offended a leader from the City\u2019s Bureau. His rank had been stagnant for so many years. Now, he was near his retirement age, and it was almost impossible for him to be promoted. At most, the agency will give him a promotion to Deputy Division Chief months before his retirement. As for Changjuan, she was senior enough to be promoted. But her character was her major flaw. The impression she gave others was too frivolous. The agency will surely not consider promoting her.After looking at everyone in the office, the two Guos had the highest chance of getting promoted.Guo Panwei was close to many leaders in the Bureau. If he put in some effect in getting their support, he stands a high chance to be promoted.Guo Shunjie knew the District Political Commissar. If the District Political Commissar really wants to groom him, Guo Shunjie does not even need to do anything, and he will be promoted. Furthermore, Guo Shunjie looks more matured, and his chances are slightly higher than Guo Panwei.No matter what, one of them will be the Deputy Chief.After analyzing all the possibilities, Dong Xuebing became depressed. If he had 6 months or 1 year, he would qualify for the promotion too. But now, there was no point to try and vie for the promotion. Dong Xuebing only hope now was for the Bureau to transfer someone from another district over to be their Deputy Chief. It will be hell for him if any of the Guos gets promoted.Damn!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfternoon.Guo Panwei, Guo Shunjie, and Zhuang Zhi came back to the General Affairs Office after their soccer match. Zhou Changchun\u2019s retirement was confirmed by Li Qing. Dong Xuebing, who was still hoping that Zhou Changchun\u2019s retirement was only a rumor, was demoralized. He sighed. Chief Zhou, if only you could retire one year later, and I will have the chance to take over your place.Good days were coming to an end for Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing clenched his fist. He whispered to Tan Limei as he went over to the copier machine. \u201cLet\u2019s visit Chief Zhou after work?\u201dTan Limei looked at him weirdly: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSee how he was recovering and at the same time ask him who will be replacing him and if there will be anyone transferring over from other offices to take over him.\u201d Dong Xuebing was troubled.Tan Limei laughed. \u201cAre you out of your mind? Visiting him now?\u201d\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d Dong Xuebing did not understand what she meant.Tan Limei poked Dong Xuebing\u2019s temple: \u201cAre you stupid? Zhou Changchun is no longer the Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office. It is meaningless for you to bootlick him. Don\u2019t you know this? His early retirement should be arranged by the leaders of the bureau. Someone up there is not happy with him. He might even be involved in corruption. If you approach him now, you are asking for trouble.\u201d\u201cDamn.\u201d Dong Xuebing shuddered. \u201cIs it that serious? What if Chief Zhou is really sick and wanted to retire?\u201dTan Limei replied. \u201cBing Zhi, listen to me. Even if it is as what you said, no higher-ups are unhappy with Zhou Changchun, and he is not involved in any corruption cases, there is still nothing for us to gain for being close to him. He is already retired, and he might be involved with something which we do not know. We will be in trouble if we approach him now. The safest thing to do now is to stay as far away from him as possible. This is not the time for you to be emotional.\u201dDong Xuebing thought hard at what Tan Limei said. \u201cYou are right.\u201d Dong Xuebing had wanted to foster a closer relationship with Zhou Changchun was because of benefits. There was no real friendship between both of them. Now Zhou Changchun was in trouble with his finances, only fools will try to be kind to him. He might also be implicated with the investigations.It was still safer to keep a distance from Zhou Changchun.Sigh\u2026\u2026 I had wasted my time to help him trade shares.Tan Limei stood up: \u201cZhuang Zhi should also not know about all these. I must remind him to stay away from Chief Zhou when he returns to pack his belongings.\u201d This place was really coldhearted. When something happens, everyone will try to keep away.Dong Xuebing got a better understanding of the cruelty of government services.The doors of the General Affairs Office were opened suddenly.Click, click, click. It was the footsteps sounds of leather shoes. Dong Xuebing looked up. It was Zhou Changchun. He was discharged from the hospital and was walking with a limp. He had recovered slightly, but still, have troubles walking. He should be back to pack his things and also to do the handover. Maybe he was back for the investigations against him.The office was silent.1 second\u2026\u20262 seconds\u2026\u2026No one greeted Zhou Changchun. Dong Xuebing felt it was too much. He greeted loudly: \u201cChief Zhou.\u201dZhuang Zhi hesitated for a while and looked at Tan Limei before greeting him: \u201cChief Zhou.\u201d\u201cChief Zhou.\u201d Changjuan, Guo Shunjie and the rest also greeted him. But their tones were very different from the past. They seem to be greeting him for the sake of greeting. Even Guo Panwei, the loyal lapdog of Chief Zhou was like this. No, he was even worst. He only moved his mouth and did not even make a sound.Seems like everyone felt that there were really discrepancies with Zhou Changchun\u2019s finances and wanted to cut all ties with him.Zhou Changchun could feel their attitude towards him. He said uncaringly: \u201cPanwei, come to my office for a while.\u201dGuo Panwei was really heartless. He immediately replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Chief Zhou. I need to deliver an urgent document.\u201d Guo Panwei had given Chief Zhou lots of gifts over the past few years, and he was the closest to him in the office.Chief Zhou frowned and looked at Guo Shunjie and the rest.Guo Shunjie and Changjuan pretended not to hear anything and continued with their work.Dong Xuebing was surprised by everybody\u2019s reaction. If it was a month ago, when Zhou Changchun entered the office, he does not even need to say a word, and all of them will be crowding around him. But now, no one was willing to help him carry his stuff. Dong Xuebing also lowered his head and pretended to be busy with his work.This is the government system. Once you are out of power, you are nothing.Zhou Changchun\u2019s face changed. He stared stare at Dong Xuebing and his former trusted aide, Guo Panwei. \u201cFine\u2026\u2026 fine\u2026\u2026 fine\u2026\u2026\u201d He limped towards his room using the wall to support. No one went up to help him.Guo Panwei, Changjuan and the rest looked at each other. Everyone knew what was in everyone\u2019s mind.Tap, tap, tap, tap\u2026\u2026The room\u2019s door was opened. Zhou Changchun seems to be making a phone call.\u201cHello, is this Chief Yan? I am Zhou Changchun.\u201d Zhou Changchun purposely speaks loudly. Dong Xuebing and everyone outside could hear what he was saying clearly.Guo Panwei and the rest were listening attentively. They wanted to know if Zhou Changchun was under investigations or not and if they were also implicated.But everyone was shocked when they heard what Chief Zhou said. \u201cYesterday, you had asked me to recommend someone to be the deputy chief for the party committee to consider\u2026\u2026. After serious considerations, I think that\u2026\u2026\u201d There was a pause of 2 seconds. \u201c\u2026\u2026 I think that Xiao Gao from the Political section is the most suitable. He is hardworking and meticulous in his work\u2026\u2026. Yes. That\u2019s right\u2026. Yes\u2026\u2026 I recommend Xiao Gao to replace me\u2026\u2026. The ones from my office? Oh, they still need more experience\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone in the office was stunned.What was happening? Why was Zhou Changchun recommending someone to take over his position?Damn! That Bureau Chief Yan trusted Zhou Changchun so much? He needs Zhou Changchun to recommend someone for the party committee to discuss if that person was suitable for promotion?No higher-ups in the bureau were unhappy with Zhou Changchun, and he was not involved in any investigations? Zhou Changchun was really retiring because of his illness?\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d Guo Panwei stood up from his chair. He was regretting. Based on his relationship with Zhou Changchun in the past, he stood the highest chance of being recommended. Even Dong Xuebing could not be compared to him. If only he went over and helped Zhou Changchun just now, and Zhou Changchun would surely recommend him. Zhou Changchun had called him to his room earlier was to discuss with him about the recommendation. He had wasted this opportunity.\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d Guo Shunjie was also regretting. He thought it was the Bureau\u2019s Party Committee that will decide who to take over this position. Zhou Changchun and Li Qing were not members of the committee and have no say in the recommendations. But who knows Chief Yan would ask Zhou Changchun to nominate someone. If he knew this would happen, he would go over to help Zhou Changchun, and Zhou Changchun might choose him. He would have higher chances to be promoted.Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie face turned black. The expressions of the rest of the people were different.Some were regretting, some were watching the show, some couldn\u2019t be bothered.Only Dong Xuebing was different from others. He only regretted for a split second and immediately looks excited.Opportunity.This is an opportunity for me!Dong Xuebing took in a deep breath: \u201cHurry and reverse the time.\u201dBACK!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe scenes in front of Dong Xuebing changed!\u201cChief Zhou.\u201d\u201cChief Zhou.\u201d\u201cChief Zhou.\u201dThe pale looking Zhou Changchun returned back to the office again. Soft and weak greetings could be heard again. Other than Zhuang Zhi, everyone else remains seated in their seats. Everyone was no longer have the respect and fear for Zhou Changchun.Zhou Changchun was furious, and he looked at his former trusted aide, Guo Panwei. \u201cPanwei, come to my office for a while.\u201dGuo Panwei points to a document in his hand: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Chief Zhou. I need to deliver an important document.\u201dGuo Shunjie immediately looks down. In his heart, he was snickering. Who would still take your orders now?Tan Limei had been scolded by Zhou Changchun for saying the wrong things when she just joined the agency. She was usually cheerful in the office, but today, she was the same as Changjuan and Old Yan. She just looks down and focuses on her work. Anyway, Zhou Changchun can no longer order them in the future. Who cares about him? Zhou Changchun was someone who might be under investigation for financial discrepancies. Whoever gets close to him now will be a fool!Zhou Changchun looked around and understood why his former staffs were treating him this way. He laughed coldly. \u201cFine\u2026\u2026 Fine\u2026\u2026 Fine\u2026\u2026!\u201d He had been in the government sector for several years, and he knew what everyone was thinking now. That\u2019s right. Who would want to get close to me now? No one! This was how cold-hearted people in the government sector were! Cutting ties with someone when they were in trouble.The next moment, everyone in the General Affairs Office, including Zhou Changchun were shocked.\u201cChief Zhou, I have some free time. Are you going to pack your office? Let me help you.\u201d A smiling Dong Xuebing ran over and supported Zhou Changchun. \u201cYou have just been discharged from the hospital. You must be careful. I will help you with your office. Watch your feet!\u201dZhou Changchun was stunned. \u201c\u2026\u2026 No need to help me. I can walk by myself.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I did not know you will be discharged today and the water in your office is empty. It\u2019s my fault. I will change the water bottle for you immediately.\u201dZhou Changchun felt better, and his face was no longer as black as before. \u201cDon\u2019t need to be so troublesome. I will be leaving after I packed my things.\u201dDong Xuebing ignored him and went out to get a bottle of water back to Zhou Changchun office. After he refilled the water dispenser, he poured a cup of water for Zhou Changchun. Dong Xuebing did not stop after this. He continued to pack Zhou Changchun\u2019s belongings for him. He packed Zhou Changchun\u2019s stuff, like food tray, mug, tea set, etc. neatly for him.Everyone else in the office was shocked by Dong Xuebing\u2019s actions. What was this Dong Xuebing thinking?Guo Shunjie shook his head. This Dong Xuebing was stupid! Why would he still bootlick an outgoing leader?Guo Panwei was also laughing to himself. This Xiao Dong was really dumb. If Zhou Changchun were being investigated for corruptions or other problems and asked to \u201cretire due to his illness\u201d, Dong Xuebing would be implicated.Tan Limei tried making eye signals to Dong Xuebing. But Dong Xuebing ignored her. She was pissed with him. She had just told Dong Xuebing about the implications for being close to Zhou Changchun a while ago! What was he thinking?!In the small room.Zhou Changchun was touched when he saw Dong Xuebing sweating for helping him. \u201cXiao Dong, sit down and rest for a while.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I am not tired.\u201d Dong Xuebing replied. \u201cDo you still have anything else to pack?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s about it. Sit down and have a chat.\u201d Dong Xuebing sat down on a chair with only half his butt touching the chair. It was like before. The correct sitting posture when sitting in front of a leader. Zhou Changchun sighed when he saw this. He patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s shoulder: \u201cIt is time like this when you will see someone\u2019s true colors. Xiao Dong. Good. I am right about you!\u201dDong Xuebing sincerely replied: \u201cThis is what my duties.\u201dZhou Changchun sighed again and squeezed Dong Xuebing\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI can finally see it! I should have known this before! You are the only one in this office that is worth grooming. But all the paperwork for my retirement were completed, and I can\u2019t take care of you in the future.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately replied: \u201cYou have been guiding and taking care of me since I joined the General Affairs Office. Thank you for your guidance, Chief Zhou.\u201dZhou Changchun paused and seems to be thinking about something. He suddenly waved his fist and looks like he had made a decision. \u201cI will not say anything else to you. Wait a while. I need to make a phone call.\u201dDong Xuebing held back his excitement and pretended to be calm. \u201cThen I will go out first?\u201d\u201cNo need. Sit there.\u201d Zhou Changchun picks up the phone on the desk and dials a number. Zhou Changchun had wanted to nominate Guo Panwei at first. But Guo Panwei\u2019s attitude just now had greatly disappointed him. Dong Xuebing on the other hand, still treated him with respect like before. Zhou Changchun was moved by Dong Xuebing\u2019s actions.The line got through. \u201cHello, is this Chief Yan? I am Zhou Changchun\u2026\u2026 Yes. I have decided who I will recommend\u2026\u2026. Thank you for your trust\u2026\u2026. Yes\u2026\u2026 I think the position of the Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhou Changchun paused and looked at Dong Xuebing. \u201c\u2026\u2026 should go to Dong Xuebing. He is the most suitable candidate to take on this role\u2026\u2026 you should know him\u2026\u2026 Right. He is the young man that ran into the fire to get back the documents\u2026\u2026. Yes. He just joined this year, and he had performed exceptionally well\u2026\u2026. Yes, this year\u2026\u2026. Although he lacks experience, but other than this, he is perfect. He is matured, meticulous, brave\u2026\u2026 Yes. I am only nominating him\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing clenched his fist. His heart almost jumped out of his mouth.Bureau Chief Yan on the line seems to be troubled. He had mentioned \u201cexperience\u201d several times in the conversation. It was not as smooth sailing when Xiao Gao from the Political Division was nominated. It was apparent that Dong Xuebing was still too junior.But when Dong Xuebing was about to give up hope, he heard Zhou Changchun suddenly said. \u201cEh? Chief Li is at your office? You can also ask Chief Li about Xiao Dong\u2026\u2026.\u201d After saying this, Zhou Changchun held the receiver and kept quiet. About 3 to 4 minutes later, Zhou Changchun smiled. \u201cChief Li is also nominating Dong Xuebing as the Deputy Chief of General Affairs Office? Yes\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 What do you think?\u2026\u2026 Ok\u2026\u2026 Thank you, Chief Yan.\u201d Zhou Changchun smiled after hanging up. \u201cXiao Dong, you are fortunate. If only me and Chief Li put your name as one of the candidates, the Bureau Chief will never approve it. But Chief Li Qing had only nominated you alone. That means our General Affairs Office had the same view. Chief Yan did not say anything, and you are considered to have qualified as one of the candidates. The Party Committee will discuss your promotion during their next meeting.\u201dDone?Am I really promoted?!Dong Xuebing said gratefully: \u201cChief Zhou, you\u2026\u2026 What can I say? I still did not meet the qualifications\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Changchun interrupted him: \u201cHaha, it is only a nomination. I will tell you the truth. This position might still be out of reach for you. Even if the General Affairs Office did not nominate Guo Shunjue and Guo Panwei, their names would also appear in the meeting through other departments. Both of them have backgrounds and connections. It is almost impossible for you to win them.\u201d Zhou Changchun was already retired, and he does not hold back. \u201cWe nominated you is to let your name appear in front of the leaders and let them have an impression of you. This will increase your chances of promotion the next time. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, sir. Thank you, Chief Zhou. Thank you!\u201dAs long as he was nominated, he will have a chance!Dong Xuebing felt he was too lucky. He did not make any wrong moves since the day he entered the General Affairs Office. He had helped Zhou Changchun traded shares, jumped into a burning office to retrieve documents, and he had final see the returns for all the efforts he put in.Dong Xuebing will not give up this chance for promotion!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfternoon.2:08 pm.After Zhou Changchun left, Tan Limei immediately pulled Feng Yu aside. \u201cBing Zhi, didn\u2019t you hear what I said? Why are you still so close to Chief Zhou?! What if the rumors about the leaders who were unhappy with him know about this? You will be in trouble! Chief Zhou had been here for a long time. Even if there were some issues with his finances, the bureau will still take care of him and let him retire due to his illness! But you are different! Who would care about a newbie like you?\u201dDong Xuebing laughed. \u201cActually, there is no problem with Chief Zhou finances. You all are overthinking.\u201dZhuang Zhi also said: \u201cI\u2026\u2026 I think what Bing Zhi did is right.\u201d\u201cRight your head!\u201d Tan Limei stared at both of them. \u201cNever mind. Do what you want. I can\u2019t be bothered with you all.\u201dGuo Shunjie and Changjuan who had gone to deliver documents returned.\u201cXiao Tan, are you unhappy at work?\u201d Guo Shunjie spoke like a leader when he saw Tan Limei talking angrily to Feng Yu.Tan Limei, who had been unhappy with Guo Shunjie, replied politely. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dGuo Shunjie nodded and walked back to his desk with his hands behind his back. He glanced at the small office. He can\u2019t wait to sit in that office. Guo Panwei looked at him and mumbled something. He grabbed a pile of documents and seems like he was about to head off to \u201creport his work progress\u201d to some leaders.Guo Shunjie looked at Guo Panwei. \u201cPanwei, why are you delivering documents to the leaders again?\u201d\u201cHehehe, didn\u2019t you just return from Political Commissar Zhou\u2019s office?\u201d Guo Panwei replied to Guo Shunjie\u2019s sarcastic remarks.Guo Shunjie said: \u201cHmph!\u201dNow, the General Affairs Office was the battlefield for Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei. Both of them were facing off each other, and it was tense. They treated each other as their biggest competitor and were unaware that Dong Xuebing was nominated. Dong Xuebing also did not want to tell anyone about this. His chances would be higher if he kept it a secret. If this was exposed now, people might gang up against him.After a while, Dong Xuebing went to Li Qing\u2019s new office.Li Qing was wiping the photo frame of his daughter\u2019s picture with a napkin. \u201cXiao Dong? Take a sit.\u201cThank you, but I will stand.\u201d Dong Xuebing did not sit down and said: \u201cDirector Li, is your daughter\u2019s health getting better?\u201dLi Qing sighed and put down the photo frame on his desk. \u201cShe got leukemia, and it is not easily treated. She is so skinny now\u2026\u2026 Ok. Let\u2019s drop this subject. Your name has been submitted to Chief Yan. Work hard and perform well. Don\u2019t let Old Zhou and I down.\u201dDong Xuebing politely replied: \u201cYes sir. I will not let you down. I will get this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026 I am not asking you to get the position of Deputy Chief. You are still too junior and do not have many chances. I am asking you to use this chance to let the higher-ups know you. The next time if there are opportunities to enter the Party School or something, the chances of you getting it will be higher. Do you know to understand me?\u201d Although Li Qing likes this young man, he felt it was impossible for him to get the position of Deputy Chief.Dong Xuebing had a bitter taste in his mouth, but he pretended to be moved: \u201cYes sir. Thank you, Director Li, for this opportunity!\u201dLi Qing nodded and took out a stack of documents from his desk. \u201cThe Bureau committee meeting is in a few days. You should try to get in touch with the leaders these few days. Here, these documents are what Chief Xu wanted. Send these to her.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201dAfter walking out of Li Qing\u2019s office, Dong Xuebing thought about his chances of getting promoted. The Bureau Committee meeting is in a few days and does he have the opportunity to overcome all the hurdles and beat the hot favorites, Guo Panwei, and Guo Shunjie? What should he do? Continue doing what he was doing? Impossible! The only way should be doing the same as what Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie were doing. Get help from the higher-ups! He needs to get one of the committee members to speak up for him! This way, his chances would be higher!Who should he look for?Zhou Guoan, Political Commissar Zhou? No. He is Guo Shunjie\u2019s backing.Political Section\u2019s Chief Pang Bing? No. He is very close to Guo Panwei.Dong Xuebing thought about the few members from the Bureau Committee he had met or heard off. In the end, he found someone who was not close to either Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie. This person had the highest possibility of speaking up for him and had a strong influence on who should get the position of Deputy Chief. Xu Yan!Knock, knock. Dong Xuebing knocked on Deputy Bureau Chief Xu Yan\u2019s office.\u201cCome in!\u201d\u201cChief Xu, Director Li asked me to send these documents to you.\u201dA middle-aged woman, who was sitting crossed legged at her desk, was looking at a piece of paper. She said in a deep voice. \u201cOk. Leave the documents there!\u201d She is Xu Yan. She is almost 50 years old, and there were rumors that she was a divorcee. Her hair was permed, and there were aged spots at the corner of her eyes. She had average looks and the aura of someone successful. She was one of the District Branch Bureau\u2019s committee members and the Deputy Bureau Chief. At the same time, she was the General Affairs Director. She can be considered Dong Xuebing\u2019s top superior. Because she was the person overseeing the General Affairs Department, she had a bigger say than the rest of the Deputy Bureau Chief on who to take on the role of Deputy Chief of General Affairs Office!If Dong Xuebing could foster a good relationship with her and let Xu Yan put in good words for him in the meeting, the chances of promotion will be much higher!Dong Xuebing placed the brown envelope carefully on the desk. He paused for a while. He wanted to speak to Xu Yan and leave an impression on her. He wondered if she had heard of the incident of him running into a burning room to retrieve documents. If she knows about this incident, it would be easier. \u201cChief Xu, I\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing also do not know how to start a conversation. He had only seen Xu Yan during meetings before and had never spoken to her.Xu Yan waved the A4 paper in her hand and asked: \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u201cHuh? Nothing\u2026\u2026 I will leave now.\u201dXu Yan finally lifted her head and looked at Dong Xuebing. \u201cEh? You are\u2026\u2026 General Affairs Department? Didn\u2019t I instruct everyone above 20 years old and below 35 years old to participate in the soccer match? Why didn\u2019t I see you on the field>\u201d Xu Yan was in charge of Western District Branch Bureau soccer team, and they were participating in the City\u2019s agencies soccer tournament. She was also the coach of the team.Dong Xuebing was disappointed when he realized Xu Yan did not recognize him. Sensing Xu Yan was getting angry, he quickly explained: \u201cI was hospitalized before the National Day holidays and was just discharged two days ago.\u201dXu Yan just replied \u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d and waved him off.Dong Xuebing was relieved and quickly walked out of the office and close the door lightly behind him.Sigh\u2026\u2026 Seems like Xu Yan\u2019s character was similar to Burea Chief Yan. Both of them were not easy to talk to. How can I establish a good relationship with her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNext day.Afternoon at 1 pm.Dong Xuebing was still thinking of how he could earn Xu Yan\u2019s trust.Li Qing, who was in wearing his sports attire entered the General Affairs Office. \u201cThe bus is here. Those that are participating in the match should change, or you all can choose to change at the stadium. The color is the same as yesterday\u2019s match. The top must be white, and the shorts do not matter.\u201d Li Qing\u2019s face changed.\u201d Everybody listen up. There are only 2 more matches, including this afternoon\u2019s game left. The higher-ups and Chief Xu had given us a mission. We must not lose again. Put in your best performance later!\u201d\u201cAh? Cannot lose?\u201d Everyone was groaning.Li Qing replied firmly. \u201cYou must treat this as a political mission! Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir!\u201dGuo Panwei and Zhuang Zhi replied immediately. But they were not confident.Dong Xuebing was glad that he had escaped this fate. He had heard from Tan Limei that their team had not won a single match out of the past 6 games and they had lost badly for every game they played. The scores were like 5:0, 3:0 and even 7:0. They had yet to score a single goal. This was why the Bureau\u2019s higher-ups gave this \u201cpolitical mission\u201d to them.Dong Xuebing, Tan Limei, and Old Yan remained in the office. Changjuan, Zhuang Zhi and the rest followed Li Qing out of the office.There was not a lot of work in the afternoon. Dong Xuebing made himself a cup of tea and watched a movie online.During the National Day Holidays, their working hours were until 3 pm. It was 5 minutes to 3 pm, and Tan Limei started packing her things. She cheerfully patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s back. \u201cBing Zhi, let\u2019s go to Yuetan Stadium to watch their match. This time, the Bureau is anxious to get a win. If they were lost all the matches in this tournament, they would surely be scolded.\u201dDong Xuebing had nothing to do at home, and he nodded. \u201cOk, let\u2019s go and have a look.\u201d Xu Yan was also there. Maybe there will be an opportunity to get closer to her.Yuetan Stadium.The Bureau had booked this stadium. Dong Xuebing and Tan Limei showed their work pass and were allowed to enter the stadium. They walked through the entrance tunnel, and they could hear cheers. Under the scorching sun, over 20 State Security members were running on the field. Zhuang Zhi was sweating and panting near his goal post. Guo Panwei was running around aimlessly and shouting \u201cPass, pass to me!\u201d Guo Shunjie was also holding on to his soccer boots and sitting by the side of the fields. It seems that he was a reserve.\u201cDefence! Defense!\u201d By the side of the field, Xu Yan in her sports attire was shouting instructions to her team. \u201cEveryone get back and defense! Mark that no. 21!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let him pass! Stop him!\u201d Li Qing was carrying Xu Yan\u2019s bag by her side and was also shouting to the players.Tan Limei whispered to Dong Xuebing. \u201cOur Chief Xu is very serious. Seems like she means what she said. Let\u2019s go. Sister Juan is over there. Let\u2019s go over.\u201dDong Xuebing stopped for a while. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we greet the leaders first?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see the leaders are busy?\u201dDong Xuebing looked at Xu Yn\u2019s back view helplessly and followed Tan Limei to where Changjuan was sitting. Changjuan was sitting with some young men and women from the Political Section and Finance Department. They were cheering listlessly for their team. \u201cGo forward and shoot!\u201d But their cheers were too soft. Compared to the other team, their cheers could not be heard.\u201cXiao Dong, Xiao Tan, you all are here?\u201d Changjuan turned to them and was holding a fan to block the sun.Dong Xuebing casually asked: \u201cSister Juan, how\u2019s the match? What\u2019s the score now?\u201dChangjuan replied: \u201cThis time, we are playing much better than the previous few matches. The score is 0:0, and there are 10 minutes left. Seems this match would be a draw. At least we fulfill Chief Xu\u2019s requirement of not losing.\u201dTan Limei gasped. \u201cWe are playing well!\u201dIt was coming to the end of the match, and all the players on the field were tired. They were running slowly after the ball without any tactics or strategies. The Western District Branch Bureau\u2019s team was not of the same standard as Chaoyang Branch Bureau\u2019s team. Most of the time, they were playing defensively. Their opponent was trying to score from far.Xu Yan shouted with her hoarse voice: \u201cDefence properly! There are only 10 minutes left!\u201dLi Qing also shouts: \u201cRun faster! All of you, run faster!\u201dChaoyang District Branch Bureau\u2019s no. 21 forward received a pass from outside the penalty area, and he turned to shoot at the goal. Zoom! It was an awkward angle, and the ball missed the goal post by inches. No. 21 held his head in anguished and then gave a thumbs up to his teammate who passed him the ball.Dong Xuebing blinked/ \u201cWho is that guy? Why is he so good?\u201d Dong Xuebing had played soccer with his University classmates. Although he was not good at it, he could tell the difference between a good player and a novice. This no. 21 was on a different level from the rest.Changjuan replied: \u201cI heard that guy was formerly from the national youth team. He is more professional than the rest. He had almost broken our defense several times.\u201dNot far away, Xu Yan was shouting angrily. \u201cMark that no. 21! Don\u2019t let him get the ball!\u201dThese few days, Xu Yan was in a bad mood. She thought these were all friendly matches to let the staff workers participate in some sports activities. That\u2019s why she took on the role of the team manager and coach. But the rest of the branch bureaus were trying their best, and her team had been losing since the start of the tournament. Xu Yan was too embarrassed by her side. This was why she gave out the orders that they must not lose today. Even a draw is good enough.8 minutes left\u2026\u20265 minutes left\u2026\u2026The score was still 0:0.Xu Yan was relieved. She looked at a middle-aged woman watching the match not far away and frowned.The bespectacled woman also saw Xu Yan and returned a sneer.Dong Xuebing was observing Xu Yan and watching the game when he noticed this detail. He asked Tan Limei if she knew who that woman was. \u201cWho is that person? Chief Xu does not seem to like her. Is she the team manager for Chaoyang team?\u201dTan Limei looked at that direction. \u201cI had never seen her before. Sister Chang, do you know that person?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Changjuan looked towards the direction where Dong Xuebing was pointing. \u201cWhy is she here?\u201dDong Xuebing asked: \u201cWho is she?\u201dChangjuan looked around her and dragged Tan Limei and Dong Xuebing to the side. \u201cThat person\u2019s name is similar to Chief Xu. Her name is Xu Yan too. She is the Deputy District Political Commissar of Eastern District Branch Bureau. Oh, I know why she is here. Tomorrow our last match is against the Eastern District Branch Bureau. She should be here to watch our team.\u201dDong Xuebing was puzzled. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a recreational tournament? Is there a need to be so serious?\u201dChangjuan laughed. \u201cThere are many things you don\u2019t know. Chief Xu and Political Commissar Xu are not on good terms. To others, this might be a friendly match. But for both of them, it\u2019s not. I heard that both of them were often arguing during the City Bureau\u2019s meeting. Hmmm\u2026\u2026. I will tell you all another secret. Keep it to yourself.\u201d Changjuan lowered her voice. \u201cDo you know Chief Xu is a divorcee? Her ex-husband remarried, and his new bride is that Xu Yan. Because of this reason\u2026\u2026 Hehe\u2026.. Do you all understand now?\u201dTan Limei said: \u201cOh\u2026\u2026 I was still wondering why Chief Xu gave out such orders. She does not want to be looked down by her rival!\u201dDong Xuebing also understood.Changjuan replied: \u201cDon\u2019t talk about this anymore. It is not nice if this is spread around. The match is ending soon. Come, let\u2019s cheer for our team!\u201dThere were only 3 minutes left on the clock.Tan Limei waved her hands excitedly: \u201cWestern District Team! Go, go go!\u201dDong Xuebing was also influenced by the atmosphere and started to cheer loudly for their team: \u201cDefence! Defense!\u201dDong Xuebing and the rest were only hoping for a draw.But things did not go as they wished. Guo Panwei, who was playing defender, accidentally knocked into one of his teammate outside the penalty area and both of them were slowed down. This gave no.21 a chance to break through their defense. He ran into the penalty area with the ball and tricked the central defender into the wrong direction with a feint. He continued onwards, and only the goalkeeper was left standing before him!The goalkeeper was Xiao Gao, from the Political Section. He does not know how to play soccer. He was chosen to be part of the team because he was taller. He rushed forward to try to block no. 21, but he accidentally tripped no. 21 to the ground. Before no. 21 fell to the ground, he kicked Xiao Gao with his boots!Both Xiao Gao and no. 21 were rolling on the field in pain.Beep! Beep!The referee from the City Bureau blew the whistle and points to the spot! Penalty!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe whistle was blown, and the crowd was in an uproar!The players from the Western District were unhappy with the referee\u2019s decision. \u201cWhere did we foul?\u201dGuo Panwei shouted anxiously: \u201cThis is a misjudgment! He is the one who kicked Xiao Gao!\u201dThe referee ignored the players\u2019 protest and points to the spot.\u201cPenalty? What is wrong with you?\u201d Xu Yan ran onto the field and shouted to the referee. \u201cWe are defending properly! It is no. 21 that had fouled! He knocked into the goalkeeper! How can you make this decision? You are so close, and you did not see it?\u201d Xu Yan looks around and shouts: \u201cWhere are the linesmen? Get the linesmen here!\u201dTan Limei, who was in the stands, was also shouting: \u201cMisjudgement!\u201dAfter Tan Limei started, the rest of the spectators also followed.Dong Xuebing kept quiet. He knew that it was hard to decide who had foul in such a scenario.The referee did not expect the Western District team manager to be so serious. Although the referee was from the City Bureau, his rank was much lower than Chief Xu. He dare not to oppose Xu Yan\u2019s decision. He hesitated and thought if he should give in to Xu Yan\u2019s demands. After all, this was only a friendly match. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 I think I might have\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore Chaoyang\u2019s team manager said anything, the bespectacled middle-aged woman walked over with her handbag.That\u2019s Eastern District Branch Bureau\u2019s Deputy Political Commissar Xu!\u201cYour decision is right. Where is the misjudgment?\u201d Xu Tan was wearing pants and a short sleeve shirt. Her eyes were small, and she should not be as pretty as Chief Xu when they were young. She sauntered and glanced at Xu Yan. \u201cI saw the incident clearly. It is the Western District goalkeeper that tripped Chaoyang\u2019s no. 21 first.\u201dXu Yan\u2019s face turned black: \u201cDeputy Political Commissar Xu, what is the meaning of this?\u201dDeputy Political Commissar Xu looked at her and replied. \u201cDeputy Bureau Chief Xu, I am saying what I had seen.\u201dXu Yan replied: \u201cI saw the incident clearly too. You don\u2019t need to interfere!\u201dDeputy Political Commissar Xu: \u201cBut you are not the referee. The referee had awarded a penalty! Right?\u201dThe referee was stuck in the middle and did not know what to say.Chaoyang Branch Bureau\u2019s team manager was only a Divisional Director, and he pretended not to see anything. Almost everyone in Beijing State Security\u2019s higher-ups knew Chief Xu, and Deputy Political Commissar Xu were loggerheads because of that incident in the past. No one wants to get involved between both women.Chief Xu and Deputy Political Commissar Xu argued for 5 minutes.In the end, they decided they had to escalate this argument to their higher-ups. A call was made to the City Bureau, who was the organizer of this tournament and the phone was passed to Chief Xu. \u201cXiao Xu, think of the bigger picture. What\u2019s the use of arguing over such a trivial matter? This is a friendly tournament. The referee had awarded a penalty, and it should be a penalty! The referee\u2019s decision is final! Carry on with the match!\u201dAfter Chief Xu ended the call, Deputy Political Commissar Xu smiled: \u201cYour team had lost how many matches in a row? 7? 8?\u201d\u201cMind your own business!\u201d Chief Xu was trying to control her anger. She could feel her blood pressure rising, and she took deep breathes to calm herself. She walked back to the sidelines and looked at the injured Xiao Gao. \u201cHow is your injury? Can you still play?\u201dXiao Gao, who was still half lying on the ground, replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chief Xu, my leg is too painful.\u201dThe no. 21 was already up on his feet and doing his warm-up for the penalty kick. He did not seem to be injured at all.Xu Yan looks terrible. She thought if Chaoyang Team scored this penalty, then Western District team will suffer 7 losses in a row. She will be laughed by Deputy Political Commissar Xu Yan. Chief Xu can afford to lose this match, but she was not willing to be laughed at by that woman! She gritted her teeth and said: \u201cSubstitute the goalkeeper! I don\u2019t care what you all do, but they must not score! You all must block this penalty!\u201dEveryone could tell Deputy Bureau Chief Xu was furious and no one dares to say a word.It was easy to substitute the goalkeeper as this tournament did not restrict the number of substitutes. Anyone who wants to play can just enter the match as substitutes. But the problem was the no. 21 player. He can be considered a professional player.It was all luck for penalty kicks. No one could tell which direction the penalty taker would kick. What if the substituted goalkeeper could not save the penalty and Chief Xu let that person take full responsibility? No one dares to say a word.1 second\u2026\u20265 seconds\u2026\u2026Xu Yan frowned. \u201cLi Qing! You will pick the goalkeeper!\u201dLi Qing smiled wearily and looked at Guo Shunjie. \u201cXiao Guo, you go and try.\u201dGuo Shunjie was stunned for a few seconds and immediately decline: \u201cI had hurt my waist, and I can\u2019t dive to save the ball. Errr\u2026\u2026\u201dThe corner of Li Qing\u2019s eyes twitched and turned to another player from the finance department. \u201cXiao Zhao, you are taller. You will be the substitute.\u201dXiao Zhao replied with a long face: \u201cDirector Li, I have never played goalkeeper before. I don\u2019t think I can save the penalty.\u201d\u201cXiao Wang, you graduate from the Police School. You should not have a problem. You will play.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dBang! Xu Yan threw her handbag on the floor and points at Guo Shunjie and the other players. \u201cNo one can play goalkeeper?! What the hell are all of you here for?!\u201dAlthough this was only a friendly tournament, the Western District team had lost too many matches. All of them also do not want to lose this match, but\u2026\u2026Tan Limei, who was standing not far away, sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s it. We thought this match is a draw. But now\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. That no. 21 is too good. no matter who becomes the goalkeeper, it is also useless.\u201d\u201c7 losses in a row.\u201d Changjuan buried her face in her hands. \u201cIf I know this would happen, I will not come here to cheer for them. It\u2019s too embarrassing!\u201dA girl from Public Security Sixth Bureau also said: \u201cThat Deputy Political Commissar Xu Yan from Eastern District is too much. It is also not her team playing now. Why is she interfering in this match?\u201dAll of them were from the Western district, and that girl was on Xu Yan\u2019s side.The referee walked over and told Xu Yan softly: \u201cChief Xu, it\u2019s time to take the penalty kick. Your side\u2019s goalkeeper\u2026\u2026\u201dDeputy Political Commissar Xu and the other team also looked over at the reserve bench. Some were getting impatient, and some were laughing at them.Chief Xu scolded the players, but no one stepped forward to be the goalkeeper.Deputy Political Commissar Xu laughter was irritating. Xu Yan\u2019s face had turned red in anger. Her hands were already shaking.Dong Xuebing was laughing in his heart when he saw Guo Shunjie lowering his head. He was hoping for Xu Yan to pick Guo Shunjie to be the goalkeeper and the other team scored the penalty. Xu Yan would surely hate Guo\u2026\u2026. Eh?!Wait!Wait a minute!Dong Xuebing paused for a while. Penalty?\u201cI will repeat myself one more time!\u201d Xu Yan was almost at her limits. \u201cOne of you have to be the goalkeeper! I don\u2019t care which one of you, but one of you must get onto the field!\u201dThe 6 reserves kept quiet, and they were praying that they will not be picked.\u201cYou all!\u201d Xu Yan was about to start screaming at the players.At this moment, a voice came from behind her. \u201cChief Xu, if no one wants to be the goalkeeper, can I try?\u201dEveryone turned back to see who was the one!It was Dong Xuebing!High-risk, high returns. This was an opportunity to get closer to the leaders.For the promotion\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s worth to take the risk!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYou?\u201d Xu Yan looked at Dong Xuebing from top to toe. Dong Xuebing had average height. \u201cAre you sure?\u201dDong Xuebing replied. \u201cI will try my best.\u201dLi Qing, who was standing beside, was relieved. He knew that at times like this, Dong Xuebing would surely step forward to help. This was no longer whether if the penalty kick could be saved or not. It\u2019s an attitude. Li Qing was lucky to have a subordinate which will offer to share his burden. This was also why Li Qing did not wish for Xiao Dong to play in this match. That no.21 will not miss this penalty kick. Li Qing did not want Xiao Dong to be responsible for their loss. \u201cChief Xu, this is Dong Xuebing. He is from our General Affairs Office. He is the one who ran into the burning office to retrieve the documents. He was injured by the fire and had just been discharged from the hospital a few days ago. Can we don\u2019t let him\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Yan frowned and remembered about that incident: \u201cHe is the firefighter?\u201dLi Qing smiled. \u201cYes, that\u2019s him.\u201dXu Yan turned and look at Dong Xuebing in his eyes. \u201cThis penalty will affect our Western District Branch Bureau\u2019s image. We cannot afford to lose this match. Are you sure you will be able to save this penalty?\u201d Xu Yan paused and then continued in a firm tone. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to try your best! You must save it! Can you do it?\u201dLi Qing immediately interrupts: \u201cChief Xu, Xiao Dong does not know how to play football. He\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing knew Li Qing was trying to protect him. He replied: \u201cChief Xu, I will definitely save this penalty!\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d Xu Yan nodded. \u201cGet on the field!\u201dDong Xuebing quickly ran to the sidelines. \u201cBrother Gao, can I borrow your gloves?\u201dThe injured goalkeeper, Xiao Gao, looked at him and passed him his gloves. \u201cPlease do your best!\u201dGuo Shunjie\u2019s uneasy feelings were gone. He thought Xu Yan would order him to be the goalkeeper. But when Dong Xuebing had volunteered, he almost cried out in joy. Foolish! What a stupid person! You are not even 1.8m tall, yet you want to be a goalkeeper? If that player kicked the ball slightly higher, you can\u2019t even touch it! Hah! You are just finding trouble for yourself. Once this penalty was scored, the whole Western District will put the blame on you! You really think you are a firefighter?Dong Xuebing was not tall and strong enough, but he walked calmly towards the goal. Everyone from the Western District was covering their faces or rubbing their temples. They looked like they had already lost the match. 7 losses in a row!Guo Panwei also felt they had already lost. He walked over and said: \u201cXiao Dong, are you confident? Why not let someone take over?\u201d He was the one who had knocked into another player, no. 21 would not be able to break through their defense and be awarded the penalty. He did not want this penalty to be scored. Everyone will pin the blame on him too.Tan Limei, Zhuang Zhi, and Changjuan also move closer.Zhuang Zhi asked: \u201cBing Zhi, have you played goalkeeper before?\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 No\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing was also not very confident.Tan Limei stared at him and shouted: \u201cYou have never played as a goalkeeper? Then why did you volunteer? Are you crazy?\u201dChangjuan added: \u201cThat\u2019s right. It is not easy to be a goalkeeper. Did you even see how that no. 21 play? He is on a different level!\u201dDong Xuebinng also knew about this. But he does not want to miss this opportunity.\u201cHurry up! Stop wasting time!\u201d\u201cHurry up! We are waiting for more than 10 minutes!\u201d\u201cAre we still playing?\u201dChaoyang District Bureau team shouted impatiently.The referee points at the goal post, indicating Dong Xuebing to get over there immediately.Seeing that they could not change Dong Xuebing\u2019s mind, Tan Limei, Changjuan and the rest walked off the pitch. \u201cBing Zhi! Just dive with all your might!\u201dZhuang Zhi also cheered: \u201cBing Zhi! You can do it!\u201dBut other than the few colleagues from the General Affairs Office, no one cheered for Dong Xuebing. All of them were listless. It was as if they had already lost the match.Dong Xuebing was pissed. Damn! How come no one else cheered for me? Do I look like a loser?In front of the goal post, Dong Xuebing stretched both his arms out. He was trying to imitate the professional goalkeepers he watched from the English Premier League on TV. He was jumping lightly and waving his arms. After some simple warmup, he stood on the line and bend forward slightly. He was staring at no. 21.No. 21 had placed the ball on the spot and had moved a few steps back.Beep! The referee blew his whistle, signaling them to start.Everyone was watching quietly.It was tense. Dong Xuebing swallowed his saliva and prayed in his heart. Please shoot off target! Please kick the ball over the post!Ta\u2026\u2026. Ta\u2026\u2026 Ta\u2026\u2026 No. 21 had started his run up to the ball!1 step\u2026\u20265 steps\u2026\u202610 steps\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing was concentrating on the ball. It\u2019s here!Bang!No. 21 kicked the ball, and the ball was curved towards the top left corner!Dong Xuebing did not gamble by choosing a direction to dive. He waited until after the ball was kicked and made an ugly save attempt.\u201cAh!\u201d Dong Xuebing shouted as he jumped and stretched out his hand!But before his arm was fully stretched, Zoom! The ball entered the net!It was a goal!It was a beautiful goal\u2026\u2026. Maybe even a professional goalkeeper could not save it!It was curved, and the ball had entered at an angle.\u201cYay!!!! We won!!!\u201d\u201cHahahaha! 1:0!\u201dBeep, beeeeeep, beeeep! The referee blew the full-time whistle!Xu Yan and everyone from the western district was pale. 7 losses in a row! Shame!Dong Xuebing took a few deep breaths and was deep in thoughts. Seems like it was impossible for him to miss this penalty. He was outstanding!2 seconds later, Dong Xuebing had a firm look in his eyes. \u201cBACK!\u201d\u2026\u2026The scenes changed! The cheers were gone!It was dead silent.Almost 90% of the people in the stadium felt it was impossible for Dong Xuebing to save this penalty kick. But Xu Yan and everyone from the Western District was looking at Dong Xuebing nervously.Beep! The referee blew his whistle, signaling them to start.1 second\u2026\u20262 seconds\u2026\u2026No. 21 looked at Dong Xuebing and thought in his heart. I had been playing since young and had got into the youth team. I am still practicing now. No one in this City Public Security can match my skills. If you all switched to a tall and big size goalkeeper, you all might still have a chance to save it. But this goalkeeper is short and small in size. How can he block my shot?! Are you all looking down on me?!Dong Xuebing did not move an inch. He was still in the same position as before. He was worried that if he made any movements, that No. 21 would kick the ball to another direction.No. 21 took his eyes off Dong Xuebing and slowly ran up to the ball.1 step\u2026\u20262 steps\u2026\u20263 steps\u2026\u2026No. 21 was getter closer and closer to the ball!Bang!No. 21 gave a hard kick!The ball flew towards the goalpost. No. 21 and the rest of Chaoyang District team were relieved. There was no mistake! No one would be able to save this ball! No even professional players!Xu Yan and the Western District team were shocked. That\u2019s it!But when everyone felt the ball was surely a goal, they realized Dong Xuebing was no longer in his previous spot. He had moved before the kick. No. 21, Xu Yan and everyone else stared disbelievingly. Xiao Dong seems to be able to know the direction of the ball. Dong Xuebing did not have a bit of hesitation and stretched out both his arms and dived towards the top left corner of the goalpost!Dong!!!The ball hit Dong Xuebing\u2019s gloves!The ball was stopped by Dong Xuebing and dropped onto the ground!Dong Xuebing shouted and dived again to stop and hug the ball tightly under his body. He did not give the other team any chances to shoot again!Saved!The penalty kick was saved!Guo Shunjie, Tan Limei, and Changjuan could not believe their eyes!No. 21 was standing there in a daze. Cannot be\u2026\u2026 How come he knows I am aiming for the top left corner?The whole stadium was dead quiet for a moment. Xu Yan was the first to recover from the shock. She shouted: \u201cTerrific! What a terrific save!\u201d\u201cGood diving save! Hahahaha! He saved that penalty kick!\u201d\u201cXiao Dong! You are the best!\u201d\u201cYay!!!!!!\u201dThe Western District Team were celebrating!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a draw!Dong Xuebing released the ball in his arms and supported himself up with both arms. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and panted. To the spectators, it was a great save. But only Dong Xuebing knew how close it was. He nearly couldn\u2019t reach it. Luckily his fingertips on his left hand and his right thumb touched the ball and stopped it.It was really a close shave!He was lucky to save it!The Chaoyang team lowered their heads in despair. The Western District team and its supporters were cheering at the top of their voices!\u201cBing Zhi!\u201d The tall and fat Zhuang Zhi ran over. \u201cYou really did it!\u201dA player which Dong Xuebing does not know gave him a thumbs up. \u201cIt was a perfect save! If we know you are so good, we should have let you be our goalkeeper in the past few matches! This way, we will not lose 6 games in a row!\u201dTan Limei also shouted in her high-pitched voice: \u201cBing Zhi! You are terrific! You can even save that ball! You are the best!\u201dChangjuan only shouted: \u201cTerrific!\u201dAll the players crowded around Dong Xuebing to thank him.Guo Shunjie saw Dong Xuebing had saved the day again and was speechless. That ball was aimed for the top left corner. How did Dong Xuebing block it so easily? This Dong Xuebing was really lucky.Eastern District\u2019s Xu Yan saw they did not lose the match and she shook her head and walk away.Chief Xu smiled as she looked at her back view. She walked over to Dong Xuebing. \u201cYou did well! It was a nice save!\u201dDong Xuebing immediately replied: \u201cThank you. It is all luck.\u201d Hahaha. I finally have the chance to impress Xu Yan. Her impression of me should improve.\u201cXiao Dong, don\u2019t be humble.\u201d Li Qing was full of smiles. \u201cYou are our hero today. Without you, our team will lose!\u201dActually, Xu Yan had heard of a capable newbie from the General Affairs Office last month. She heard about Dong Xuebing from Deputy Bureau Chief Yang Yizhong. Later, she heard that it was that newbie who risked his life to enter a burning office to retrieve some important documents. But she had been swamped and did not have the time to meet this newbie. She only knew Xiao Dong was that newbie just now. Xu Yan looked at Dong Xuebing closely and nodded. Dong Xuebing really deserved the nickname \u201cFirefighter.\u201d He could even save that penalty kick.On the bus back, everyone was still talking about the match excitedly.In the last row of the bus, Xu Yan asked Dong Xuebing to sit beside her. \u201cI heard from Director Li that you had just been discharged from the hospital and is not fully recovered yet. Can you play in tomorrow\u2019s match? I am thinking of letting you be our first-choice goalkeeper. I think the rest of the players will agree to this.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Dong Xuebing was shocked. Damn!Xu Yan asked with a stern look: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You cannot play?\u201dDong Xuebing knew how good he was at soccer. He was able to save the penalty kick because of his power BACK. He can\u2019t use his power for the entire match. He can\u2019t imagine what would happen if he were to play the whole game. He was only able to take advantage of his powers within a minute. He immediately explained. \u201cChief Xu, I\u2019m sorry. The doctors told me to avoid strenuous exercise for some time. I don\u2019t think I will be able to play the full match. Errr\u2026\u2026 How about this? If there is a penalty or some free kicks in a dangerous position, substitute me in.\u201dXu Yan thought for a while: \u201cFine.\u201dDong Xuebing sighed with relieved.After that, Xue Yan took out her pen and start scribbling on her notebook. She seems to be planning for tomorrow\u2019s tactics.Xu Yan had influence over who to take over the role of Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office. These few days, Guo Shunjie had tried to be closer to her but was unsuccessful. When he saw Dong Xuebing sitting beside her, he was furious. Guo Shunjie had made plans to get rid of Dong Xuebing once District Political Commissar Zhou helped him get the position. He must get rid of him at all cost!Dong Xuebing also noticed Guo Shunjie staring at him. He felt uncomfortable.Dong Xuebing would rather offend a gentleman than to offend a villain. This Guo Shunjie must be up to no good!No! He must not be the Deputy Chief! I must work harder to get the position!Soon, the bus enters the Western District Branch Bureau\u2019s main gates, and everyone starts to alight. It was after working hours, and there were no one around.Xu Yan was the last to alight from the bus. She stood there looking at all the players. \u201cThankfully Xiao Dong was able to save that penalty kick today, and we can end our 6 matches losing streak. But remember this. We still have not won a match for 7 matches. We are the last team of the tournament. Don\u2019t you all feel embarrassed?\u201dGuo Shunjie wanted to voice out that they were embarrassed. But the team was not strong enough.Xu Yan continued with a cold look on her face. \u201cToday, I want all of you to go back and have a good rest. At the same time, reflect on the reason why we can\u2019t win a single match. Tomorrow is the last match of the tournament. I don\u2019t want to see us getting a draw or lose. Tomorrow we will be facing Eastern District. We must win! We will show them how good the Western District is! Are you all confident of getting a win tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes.\u201dThe players replied weakly.\u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d Xu Yan shouted. \u201cAre you all confident?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d This time, the players\u2019 replies were louder.\u201cGood. Dismiss!\u201d Xu Yan was acting like a coach.Actually, the players who knew the insider information knew why Xu Yan was so serious. The opponent tomorrow was Xu Yan\u2019s long-time rival, Deputy District Political Commissar Xu. No matter whether it was officially or privately, Xu Yan does not want to lose to Deputy District Political Commissar Xu.On the way home, Dong Xuebing was thinking about the day\u2019s event.He had left a good impression with Xu Yan. But it was not enough. She would not help him get the position of Deputy Chief over such a trivial matter. If he wants Xu Yan to help him, he must do something more significant and will mean a lot to her. But what should he do? Eh? Tomorrow\u2019s match is significant to Xu Yan and the Western District team! 7 games without a single win?! No one will want that result! This is a must win the match! Then\u2026\u2026 what should Dong Xuebing do to perform and let Xu Yan be grateful to him?That\u2019s right!Must make use of this opportunity to get closer with the leaders! This way, Guo Shunjie will not be promoted!Penalty! Let tomorrow\u2019s match have a penalty!I pray for a chance to save a penalty kick again tomorrow!Tomorrow\u2019s match is critical!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNext day.Yuetan Stadium.The air in the stadium was tense. It was the calm before the storm. Deputy Bureau Chief Xu Yan lead the Western District team into the stadium from the side gates. Across the field, the eastern district team, in their red jersey, were doing their warm up. Xu Yan had a stern look on her face. She looked at every player on her team. \u201cI will repeat this once more! We aim to win! Do your best out there! Don\u2019t embarrass the Western District branch!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dToday\u2019s match was crucial, and many people from the branch bureaus were there to support their team. Tan Limei, Changjuan, and even Old Yan were there. Guo Panwei and Zhuang Zhi were in the starting line up as usual. Maybe it was because Xiao Gao and another regular player were injured in yesterday\u2019s match, Guo Shunjie was in the starting line-up. The players took off their jackets and started their warm up on the field. Dong Xuebing and two other reserves were standing behind Xu Yan and Li Qing, facing the field.Deputy District Political Commissar Xu was standing about 10 meters away from Dong Xuebing and the rest.Deputy Chief Xu Yan stared at Deputy District Political Commissar Xu coldly.Deputy District Political Commissar Xu turned and smiled at Xu Yan. \u201cIf your team prepared to lose?\u201dXu Yan frowned. \u201cThis is the question I wanted to ask you.\u201d\u201cHahaha, where did you get your confidence from?\u201dDeputy District Political Commissar Xu should have given her team orders to win at all cost. The spectators could feel the tension between both teams before the start of the match. The referee was still the same referee from yesterday\u2019s match. When both sides were ready and in position, he blew the whistle to start the game.The Eastern District Team kick off, and they immediately broke through the midfield defense.Commissar Xu shouted loudly: \u201cAttack! Put pressure on them!\u201dThe Eastern District players were rushing forward. They did not even care about their defense. Bang! A misjudged pass was intercepted by Western District player from the branch\u2019s Commission for Discipline Inspection. But before his teammates could counter-attack, a boot with the studs facing him came rushing towards him. He got a shock and quickly avoided that player. In the end, he lost control of the ball, and the Eastern District team got the ball back.The match was exciting.Dong Xuebing clenched his fist and prayed silently in his heart. Please have a foul or penalty kick. Huh? He suddenly felt bad. All his teammates and leaders wished for a win, but he was praying for his team to be in trouble. If anyone from the Western District knows what he was thinking, he would surely be beaten up.Beep!!! The referee blew the whistle for a foul.Dong Xuebing look up and saw Zhuang Zhi on the ground, holding his feet and shouting in pain. A player was standing beside him with his palms facing up, talking to the referee. The referee looked at Zhuang Zhi\u2019s condition and hesitated for a few seconds before showing a yellow card to the other player.Xu Yan was pissed. \u201cThat is dangerous play! That kick is above waist level! Why is that only a yellow card?!\u201dDong Xuebing skipped a heartbeat when he saw Zhuang Zhi could not get up on his feet. He immediately ran over with a reserve player with the first aid kit. They sprayed some medicine on Zhuang Zhi\u2019s leg. \u201cZhuang Zhi! How bad is your injury?\u201d Dong Xuebing knew Zhuang Zhi well. He was not the type who would feign injury. He must be really in pain from his facial expression.Zhuang Zhi gritted his teeth and shook his head: \u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026. I \u2026\u2026 Can\u2019t carry on with the match\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I will help you off the field.\u201d Dong Xuebing helped support Zhang Zhi to the sidelines. The other reserve player made some gesture to Xu Yan.Xu Yan stared at the referee with a long face.The Western District players were unhappy with the referee\u2019s decision. They crowded around the referee: \u201cHe is not aiming for the ball! He is aiming for his legs!\u201d\u201cRed card! He should be sent off!\u201dCommissar Xu looked at Xu Yan and said: \u201cI think it is your player who is diving.\u201dDamn! Feng Yu was furious.The tempers were rising. It was only 5 minutes into the game, and there was 4 dangerous play by the opposing team. If this were not instructions from Commissar Xu, the players would not dare to be so aggressive. Even the World Cup finals matches were not so rough, let alone a friendly match between two government branches! This type of play was explicitly targeting the Western District team and Xu Yan!Tan Limei ran over and took the medical spray from Dong Xuebing. She continued to spray the medicine on Zhuang Zhi\u2019s injured leg. She was almost in tears.Dong Xuebing was furious. He glanced at the smiling, Commissar Xu I will remember this!In the end, the reserve player who went on the field with Dong Xuebing earlier replaced Zhuang Zhi. After this incident, the Western District players became more aggressive in their play. Curses and swears could be heard throughout the match. They no longer care if leaders were watching the game.10 minutes\u2026\u202620 minutes\u2026\u2026The Eastern District players were still tackling from behind, aiming for the players\u2019 legs. They did not care even if they will get yellow cards or got sent off.\u201cAhhhhh!!!!!\u201dWhen the first half of the match was about to end, there was a horrible shriek!Eastern District team\u2019s no, 13 had elbowed one of the Western District players in the back when they were fighting for the ball. The Western District player was sent flying on the pitch and could no longer get up on his feet!The referee could not see what happened from his position, and he just awarded a foul. There were no yellow cards.Dong Xuebing and many others saw what happened. Everyone shouted: \u201cThat\u2019s a red card!\u201dThe Western District players surrounded the referee: \u201cHe had elbowed him!\u201d\u201cAre you blind? You did not see what happened?\u201dThe referee stick to his decision and even showed the yellow card to the player who scolded him!Xu Yan had a terrible expression on her face. But she remembered yesterday\u2019s phone call from her higher-up, asking her to think of the big picture. She took a deep breath and said: \u201cStop it and carry on with the match!\u201dThe first half was over. The Western District team got a yellow card, and the Eastern District Team got 4. The score was still 0:0/During the half time break, a player from the Public Security Sixth Bureau shouted: \u201cLeader, they are playing dirty. Can this even be considered a football match?\u201dAnother player complaint. \u201cThe referee is siding with them! There is no way we can win!\u201dXu Yan frowning and not saying a word. She was also furious by the actions of the opposing team. She suspects Commissar Xu did not want a win from this match. She was only aiming for a draw and wanted the Western District team to have zero wins from 8 games. She might also be trying to get the Western District team to use up all their reserve players. This way, the Western District team will have to play with lesser players!Because of injuries, the Western District team only have 3 reserve players today. Dong Xuebing was the reserve goalkeeper. With the injured player injured substituted out before halftime, the Western District team does not have any more reserve players except for Dong Xuebing. If there were still players injured in the second half, goalkeeper Dong Xuebing might have to go on the pitch to play. A goalkeeper playing as a defender or a striker?We are losing?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Other than those players who got yellow cards were played cautiously, the rest of the players were playing \u201cdirty.\u201d Both sides were attacking. When the Western District players threaten them, the Eastern District players will purposely foul them. They pushed, tackled, pulled, and even hugged. They will do whatever it takes to stop the Western District from scoring a goal.The Western District players were not playing to their usual standards. Xu Yan, Dong Xuebing and the rest of their supporters were vexed!Because her boyfriend was injured, Tan Limei was supporting her team angrily. \u201cWestern District! Go for it!\u201d Changjuan and a few other girls from the Finance Department were also cheering for their team. When the opposing team played dirty, they will curse and swear at that player.15 minutes\u2026\u202630 minutes\u2026\u2026There was no progress in the match. The score was still 0:0.Will this game ended in a draw? That will be zero wins in 8 games!Dong Xuebing was no longer hoping for the other team to be awarded a penalty kick. Even if he had saved the penalty kick, the match would still end in a draw. He was pissed by the Eastern District team and Deputy Political Commissar Xu. He was hoping for a win.Finally, in the last two minutes of the match, an opportunity arises for the Western District team!Guo Panwei was long pass from the midfield had touched an opposing team player, and the ball fell in front of their team\u2019s striker. No players were guarding him, and that striker turned and ran with the ball towards the goal.Xu Yan jolt up and shouted: \u201cEveryone goes forward and supports him! Press forward!\u201dThe Eastern District team\u2019s defense line had been moved up the field, and the striker only has to face a defender. If he gets past this defender, he might score the winning goal!The Western District team saw a glimpse of hope and rushed forward to provide support!At the same time, Political Commissar Xu also shouted. \u201cStop him! Don\u2019t let him through!\u201d The defender heard her orders and increase his speed. The small size striker moved the ball slightly to his left and wanted to get past the defender. But that defender ignored the ball and went straight for the striker!Crash! The defender crashed into the striker!The striker fell onto the ground and was rolling in pain.Beep! Beep! The referee showed a yellow card and gave a free kick to the Western District team.Yellow card and a free kick? If the striker gets past the defender, it will be a goal!Li Qing ran onto the pitch to check the striker\u2019s injuries. Seeing that he could no longer continue with the match, the Western District Team went into a rage!\u201cFuck! I quit!\u201d A player from the Finance Department took off his jersey and threw it on the floor!Guo Panwei shouted furiously: \u201cShouldn\u2019t this be a red card?!\u201d\u201cYou did it on purpose!\u201d Two players from the Political Section shoved that defender.The Eastern District team players also ran over, and both sides started arguing. The situation was getting out of control!Maybe it was because this was the last match of the tournament, two leaders from the City Bureau entered the stadium through one of the side gates. They should be there to watch the game. But when they saw what was happening on the pitch, they immediately shouted: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What are you all doing?\u201dMost of the players recognized the leaders, and the arguments stopped.The leader with a small mustache looked over at the reserve bench: \u201cXu Yan (Deputy Branch Bureau Chief Xu), Xu Yan (Deputy Political Commissar Xu), is this the way you all lead your teams? Look at them!\u201d He pointed at the players. \u201cIs this the way your players should act?\u201dDeputy Political Commissar Xu tried to push the blame: \u201cDirector Li, it is Chief Xu\u2019s team that is unhappy with the referee decision.\u201dXu Yan was furious. She immediately tried to argue: \u201cDirector Lu! The Eastern District team\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Director Lu ignored her. \u201cI don\u2019t care what happened! I just want to know if this match can continue?\u201dXu Yan paused for a few seconds and replied: \u201cYes!\u201dDirector Lu waved his hand and said: \u201cHurry up and carry on with the match!\u201d He was no longer in the mood to watch the match. He turned and walked out of the stadium with the other leader.Deputy Political Commissar Xu smiled and looked at Xu Yan. \u201cChief Xu, you should substitute your player.\u201dLi Qing was furious at Deputy Political Commissar Xu, but she was higher ranked than him, and he cannot show his anger. He can only shout: \u201cChange player! I want a striker!\u201d But the Western District supporters were all women and middle-aged men. Dong Xuebing was the only reserve player left. There were no strikers to replace the injured player.Xu Yan knew it was impossible to win today\u2019s match.Ring, ring, ring\u2026\u2026 Xu Yan\u2019s mobile phone rang. She let Li Qing take over and walked to the reserve bench to answer her phone. It was her ex-husband, and also Deputy Political Commissar Xu\u2019s current husband. Xu Yan frowned and answered. \u201cHello, what do you want?\u201dA man asked in a deep voice. \u201cWhere is my son?\u201dXu Yan replied: \u201cAt home playing video games.\u201d\u201cWhy are you letting him play video games again? I knew he will be wasting his time when he goes over to your place!\u201d The man growled. \u201cI will be finishing my work early today and will fetch my son from your place. Tomorrow is Xu Yan\u2019s birthday, and he said he wanted to celebrate her birthday with her last week. He will not be staying with you this week. We shall talk again next month.\u201dXu Yan tightens her grip on her phone: \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? Our son must live with me for a week every month. This is what we agreed before we divorced! Why are you fetching him away after one day?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I said it is Xu Yan\u2019s birthday? Our son had agreed!\u201d\u201cWhat has her birthday got to do with my son?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you! I will bring my son back later! That\u2019s it!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xu Yan\u2019s ex-husband had hung up the phone. Xu Yan almost threw her phone on the floor out of anger. Suddenly she swayed and knocked onto a pillar. She almost fell.Dong Xuebing had been looking at Xu Yan and immediately ran over to help her. \u201cChief Xu, are you ok?\u201dXu Yan did not reply and took out a half tablet of high blood pressure medicine from her bag. She swallowed the pill with some water and sat there panting. Since the day Xu Yan (Deputy Political Commissar Xu) appeared, her life was turned upside down. Her husband was taken away from her, her family was taken away from her. Now, her son will be taken away from her. She got nothing left! All she had left was anger!Before this match, Chief Xu wanted to win badly. But now\u2026\u2026 she could not even fulfill such a small wish!This incident had wasted some time, and there was only less than 1 minute on the clock. No players on the pitch could score a goal, and there were no players to substitute. Is there anything worse than this?Xu Yan felt needles were poking her heart when she saw the gloating Deputy Political Commissar Xu smiling at her.Defeat!She was defeated by Deputy Political Commissar Xu again!Xu Yan laughed at herself and lean back on her chair.Dong Xuebing could feel Xu Yan\u2019s helplessness feelings. He could not stand there and do nothing. He clenched his fist and said: \u201cChief Xu! Let me play!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Didn\u2019t the doctors tell you not to do strenuous sports? The Eastern District players are too rough. What if you get injured again? There is no need for you to take the risk.\u201d Xu Yan sighed. \u201cDirector Li, tell the referee that we will not change players. We will carry on with 10 men.\u201dDong Xuebing stubbornly insist: \u201cChief Xu! Please let me play!\u201dLi Qing scolded. \u201cXiao Dong! We are doing this for your own good!\u201dXu Yan looked at Dong Xuebing\u2019s determined look. She hesitated and said: \u201cJust be careful.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Dong Xuebing turned and ran onto the pitch.The referee announced there was one minute of injury time and blew the whistle. The Western District players saw Dong Xuebing, who had just been discharged from the hospital and was the reserve goalkeeper replacing their injured striker, they lost confidence. Tan Limei, Changjuan, and the rest of the supporters stop their cheering. They watched the match silently. They had lost hopes for winning. Their district will be known as the district with zero wins from 8 games.59 seconds remaining\u2026\u202655 seconds remaining\u2026\u2026The player taking the freekick was big sized. He ran up to the ball and aimed straight at the goal.But it was too far, and the player was not skillful enough. The ball hit Guo Shunjie\u2019s chest which was beside the wall and rolled to the feet of the opposing team player!Political Commissar Xu shouts: \u201cAttack! This is the final chance!\u201d49 Seconds remaining\u2026\u2026The best defense was to attack. The Eastern District players did not hide in their own half. All of them rushed forward. With a series of short passes, they moved towards the Western District penalty box.28 Seconds remaining\u2026\u2026The Western District players were running back to defend at full speed.Dong Xuebing did not join the rest to defend. As the striker, he can only wait at the center of the field waiting for his teammates to pass him the ball. Come on! Get the ball back!The Eastern District player who had injured Zhuang Zhi suddenly shot at the goal!Bang! The ball hit one of the defenders and deflected to feet of the Western District player from Commission for Discipline Inspection!15 seconds remaining\u2026\u2026Political Commissar Xu screams at her players. \u201cThere is no more time! Stop him from passing!\u201dTwo nearby Eastern District players immediately charged at him and one of them, a midfielder, managed to steal the ball away from him!There were only 11 seconds left!That\u2019s it! It\u2019s the end of the match!The Eastern District players stop attacking, and the Western District players also gave up hope of winning.10 seconds remaining\u2026\u20269 seconds remaining\u2026\u2026The Eastern District midfielder managed to dodge Guo Panwei and another player\u2019s tackle and kicked the ball back to his own half. But he used slightly more strength, and the ball flew over the last two defenders and landed outside the penalty box.That was not important as there was no more time.5 seconds remaining\u2026\u20264 seconds\u2026\u2026The ball bounced twice and went out of play.The referee looked at his watch and did not award the throw in. He blew the full-time whistle!That\u2019s it. No wins in 8 matches!Xu Yan laughed at herself and walk off with her bag. The Western District players were walking off the pitch, disappointed. The players did not even shake the other team players\u2019 hands as they walk away.The only person that was behaving differently was Dong Xuebing. He was deep in thoughts as he stared at the other team\u2019s penalty box.After a while, Dong Xuebing\u2019s eyes brighten up!BACK!!!\u2026\u2026There were shouts and sounds coming from everywhere!The next moment, Dong Xuebing saw the Eastern District midfielder stole the ball!There were only 10 seconds left!The opposing team players were smiling, and after dodging Guo Panwei and another player\u2019s attempt to get the ball back, the Eastern District midfielder laughed and kicked the ball back to his half. He wanted to waste the remaining few seconds. The moment he kicked the ball, the players from both teams knew that was the end of the match. No one wanted to run after the ball and were standing there waiting for the referee to blow the whistle!But something unexpected happened!\u201cAh! Look!\u201d\u201cDamn! Who is that?\u201dEveryone realized that a few seconds before the ball was kicked, a player from the Western District started running!It was Dong Xuebing!The moment that midfielder kicked the ball, Dong Xuebing ran past the last two defenders! To everyone\u2019s surprise, the outstanding goalkeeper from yesterday\u2019s match seems to know where the ball was heading and where it will land! Dong Xuebing did not even look at the ball and continued running towards the area two meters outside of the penalty box. 1 meter! 2 meters! 3 meters!There were 6 seconds left!Everyone was staring in shock. The ball amazingly landed at that spot!The ball accurately landed at Dong Xuebing\u2019s feet, and he stopped it.Xu Yan jumped up from her seat!One on one with the goalkeeper!There were no defenders in front of Dong Xuebing! It was only the goalkeeper in front of him!Dong Xuebing could hear the footsteps of the defenders approaching from behind. He kept his cool and continue his run forward with the ball!There were only 3 seconds left!The goalkeeper ran forward to stop Dong Xuebing!Dong Xuebing tapped the ball lightly with his feet and changed his direction!1 second left!Bang!Dong Xuebing used all his strength to kick the ball with his right foot!The football brushed against the goalkeeper\u2019s left boots and continued flying towards the goal!Dong Xuebing and all the rest of Western District players could feel their hearts skipped a beat. They stared at the ball nervously as the ball flew towards the open goal. It was only 0.5 seconds, but it feels like an eternity. 5 meters, 4 meters, 3 meters, 2 meters. 1 meter! Swished! The ball entered the goal in the top right corner!Goal!!!!!A miraculous goal!!!!The whole stadium was dead quiet. There was no cheers or shouts. It was eerily quiet!1-second pass\u2026\u20262 seconds pass\u2026\u20263 seconds pass\u2026\u2026Xu Yan was the first to react. She dropped her bag on the floor and shouted with all her might: \u201cGoal!!!!!!!\u201dDong Xuebing dropped on the ground, raised his arms, and shouted.\u201cWe won?\u201d The Western District players could not believe their eyes!\u201cWe won! We won the match!!!\u201dThen\u2026\u2026 the whole stadium cheered!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The goal was too fast for any of them to react!The referee was the only person on the pitch who saw the whole process.Dong Xuebing had left a deep impression with the referee from yesterday\u2019s match. When Dong Xuebing came onto the pitch in this match, the referee was still laughing in his heart. A goalkeeper playing as a striker? What nonsense is this? But the referee knew that the Western District had no more reserves and he couldn\u2019t care less. The match was about to end too. He had already placed the whistle in his mouth and prepared to end the game. But when he was about to blow the whistle, he saw Dong Xuebing started to run towards the penalty box on the other end of the field. The referee was curious about what was he doing.The next moment, an unexplained situation happened.The Eastern District midfielder kicked the ball back to his half without even looking back!This was more than a stroke of luck. The referee even suspects that midfielder was in cahoots with Dong Xuebing. The referee swore that the midfielder\u2019s long pass back was after Dong Xuebing started running. There were no indications that he will pass the ball back. He just turned around suddenly and kicked the ball back towards Dong Xuebing\u2019s direction. The ball landed perfectly at Dong Xuebing\u2019s feet. What a coincidence! He could not understand how Dong Xuebing did it. It seems impossible!After the goal was scored, the referee was stunned. He stood there for almost 5 seconds, before blowing the full-time whistle!The referee wondered who this person was. It was too unbelievable!1:0. Western District Branch Bureau won the game!At the stands, Tan Limei grabbed Zhuang Zhi and Changjuan\u2019s hands. \u201cDamn! Am I dreaming? We won? We really won this match!?\u201dOld Yan, who does not like football, was also excited. \u201cOur Xiao Dong is excellent!\u201dCheers! Screams! Shouts!The stadium was in an uproar!Xu Yan, Li Qing and the rest of Western District supporters ran onto the pitch!All the Western District players had already surrounded Dong Xuebing. \u201cXiao Dong! You are terrific!\u201dThe player from the bureau\u2019s Commission for Discipline Inspection: \u201cI swear that goal was the most beautiful goal I saw in my life!\u201dA tall player from the Political Section asked: \u201cWhen did you run over there? It\u2019s too fast! The goal was scored before I can even react!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a coincidence.\u201d Dong Xuebing smiled and stood up.\u201cBrothers!\u201d A defender from Public Security Sixth Bureau clapped his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s have a celebration!\u201d\u201cHahaha! Sure!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I am thinking too!\u201dAll the players turned and looked at Dong Xuebing. Before Dong Xuebing realized what was happening, 7 to 8 players grabbed him and threw him up in the air. \u201cYeah!\u201d The players caught him as he lands and then threw him up in the air again. \u201cYeah!\u201d this continued for 5 to 6 times. Before Dong Xuebing got back on his feet, he noticed his boots were lost!Dong Xuebing was overjoyed when he saw his teammates so happy. He finally got the revenge for Deputy Branch Bureau Chief Xu and Zhuang Zhi!\u201cLet him down!\u201d Xu Yan walked quickly towards them. \u201cXiao Dong has just been discharged from the hospital and is not fully recovered!\u201dThe players remembered this and quickly put down Dong Xuebing. They were even more impressed with Dong Xuebing. That\u2019s right. Xiao Dong got injured when he ran into the burning office to retrieve documents. But before he recovered from his injuries, he managed to save a penalty kick and scored the winning goal in the last few seconds of today\u2019s match.No wonder his nickname was \u201cfirefighter!\u201dHe really deserves this nickname! Whenever there are difficulties, he will be there to save the day!Dong Xuebing stood at attention in front of the two approaching leaders. \u201cChief Xu, Director Li!\u201dLi Qing had a wide grin on his face: \u201cYou did not disappoint everyone of us! Good! Good!\u201dXu Yan did not say anything, but from her eyes, everyone could tell that she was overjoyed.The other side of the field, the Eastern District players were looking down in despair. Deputy District Political Commissar Xu faced was red with anger. She pointed to the midfielder who gave away that goal and scolded. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? There are only seconds away from the end of the match, and you make this stupid mistake? What did I say before the match? Ah? Are eyes behind your head? No? Then why did you kick the ball back? Why didn\u2019t you check if the coast is clear before you pass the ball? You all! What are the rest of you doing? Don\u2019t you understand what is one on one marking? Did you all mark him?\u201dThe midfielder and the rest of the players bowed their head. There was no way to retort. They were also frustrated by the score. It was almost the end of the match, and a reserve goalkeeper scored the winning goal? This sounded like a joke. But this was the truth, and it was still a beautiful goal!Political Commissar Xu was still not satisfied. She continued scolding her players.Xu Yan looked over at the other team. She felt relieved. She had finally vented the frustrations she kept in her heart for years.\u201cAll of you have done well. Go back and have a good rest. Work is as usual tomorrow!\u201d Xu Yan said. As she turned and walked past Dong Xuebing, she said softly: \u201cThank you\u2026\u2026\u201dBut Xu Yan was too soft, and Dong Xuebing did not hear it. \u201cAh? What did you say?\u201dXu Yan\u2019s expression returned to her usual no-nonsense, serious expression. She patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s shoulders and walked out of the stadium with Li Qing. Behind them, the players and supporters crowded around Dong Xuebing.Only Guo Shunjie stood away from Dong Xuebing. He was looking terrible. He also wishes for his team to win, but he did not want Dong Xuebing to score the goal. If it was like this, he rather lost the match. Seeing Dong Xuebing was the center of attraction, he was pissed! Why was this guy so lucky? This happens every time. When will his good luck end?After today, Dong Xuebing\u2019s nickname \u201cFirefighter\u201d spread to every office in the Western District Branch Bureau!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hahaha.\u201dDong Xuebing arrived at his workplace as usual. But today was different. The biggest difference was many colleagues from other departments went up to him to greet him. Some of them were his teammates who had played in the last two matches, and some were strangers. Everyone smiled and greeted him.Dong Xuebing replied them politely. He felt he had successfully integrated with everyone in the bureau.Dong Xuebing arrived at the General Affairs Office. \u201cGood morning, everyone. Zhuang Zhi, how\u2019s your leg?\u201dZhuang Zhi nodded. \u201cI feel better this morning.\u201d\u201cHis body is so big. How can his injury be serious?\u201d Tan Limei laughed and looked at Dong Xuebing. \u201cBing Zhi, I told my mother how you scored the goal in the last few seconds of the match. Guess what. My mum does not believe me. She insists I am telling lies. She even said that if you are so good at football, why are you still a civil servant? You would be a professional player!\u201dDong Xuebing laughed. His goal was to be a top official. A football player is nothing compared to a senior government official.The other side of the office, Changjuan with her signature seductive smile, showed a crayon painting to Dong Xuebing. It was a picture of a man and a football. \u201cMy son drew this. He said he wanted to be a footballer when he grows up. Hehe\u2026\u2026 Xiao Dong, when my son is older, you must teach him how to play football.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cSister Chang, I am an average player myself. If you don\u2019t mind me teaching, I\u2019m fine with it.\u201dChangjuan laughed: \u201cLook, he is modest.\u201dThe office door opened. Guo Shunjie entered the office and saw Dong Xuebing and the rest chatting. He frowned and asked: \u201cWhere is Guo Panwei? Why is he not in the office?\u201dDong Xuebing cursed in his heart. You are not our leader, and what has it got to do with you when one of us is late?Changjuan looked at her watch. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he is caught in a jam.\u201d\u201cHe should leave for work earlier to avoid the traffic! It is working hours now!\u201dWhen Guo Shunjie finished, there were footsteps outside, and Guo Panwei arrived at work. He glanced at Guo Shunjie and sneered. \u201cEven if I am late, you are in no position to reprimand me. Furthermore, you also just arrived yourself.\u201dGuo Shunjie ignored his remarks. He thought to himself. I shall see if you can continue to be so arrogant after next week\u2019s Branch Bureau\u2019s Party Committee meeting! Fight with me for the position of Deputy Chief? You are only overestimating yourself!The remaining time in the office, both of them tried to outdo each other!It seems like no one knows that Dong Xuebing was nominated for the position of Deputy Chief yet.Dong Xuebing thought to himself if Bureau Chief Yan had forgotten about him. But after thinking for a while, he concluded. It should be the higher-ups that knew about his nomination, and they should feel that it was impossible for a newcomer to be promoted. The nomination was only to make up the numbers. That\u2019s why District Political Commissar Zhou and Director Pang did not tell Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei about his nomination. He was someone who cannot even qualify as their rivals.Dong Xuebing was feeling frustrated. The meeting was next week, and he cannot wait any longer. If not, Guo Shunjie will be promoted, and he will be taking revenge on him! What should he do? Ask Xu Yan for help? What if Xu Yan refuses to help him? He also cannot tell Xu Yan what he wants directly. Furthermore, he had just gotten closer to Xu Yan, and the next day, he goes and asks her for favors? What will she think? But if he did not ask for Xu Yan for help, how would she know that he wants to be the Deputy Chief?Dilemma. This was a dilemma!Dong Xuebing was just a newbie civil servant, and all these were new to him. He still does not have the experience and doesn\u2019t know what to do. He wanted to ask someone for advice. But he cannot ask Tan Limei. She is too junior. Changjuan and Old Yan were experienced, but they were not close. He can\u2019t ask them.Dong Xuebing ponder at his desk for over an hour. He could not think of a solution.Ring, ring, ring. The General Affairs Office phone rang.Tan Limei answered the phone politely and hang up after a while. She turned to Dong Xuebing: \u201cBing Zhi, Chief Xu wants to bring the keys for Political Section Old Shen\u2019s room to her.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s heart skipped a beat: \u201cWhere are the keys?\u201d\u201cWait a minute. I will look for it.\u201d Tan Limei took her keys and opened a cabinet by the wall. She looked into the second drawer and took out a brown envelope. She passed the envelope to Dong Xuebing. There were at least two to three brunches of keys in it.On the way upstairs, Dong Xuebing tried to organize his words. He wanted to make himself sounds better.Knock, knock. Dong Xuebing knocked on Deputy Bureau Chief Xu\u2019s office.\u201cEnter!\u201d Dong Xuebing entered the office and saw Xu Yan in a black suit sipping on a cup of tea. She was sitting in front of her monitor, looking at some reports.Dong Xuebing handed over the envelope with both hands. \u201cChief Xu, this are the keys you wanted.\u201dXu Yan nodded and pointed to her desk, signaling to Dong Xuebing to leave the envelope there. \u201cYou had run a lot yesterday. How are your injuries?\u201dDong Xuebing replied. \u201cThank you for asking. I am fine.\u201d Should I ask her? Tomorrow is Saturday. If I don\u2019t ask now, I will not have the chance to ask again. \u201c\u2026\u2026 Chief Xu, I\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing saw Xu Yan looked at him and he immediately change his words. \u201cErrr\u2026. Chief Liu from the Finance Department is still on leave. The gifts given out for the National Day holidays are still in our office. Should we bring it over to the Finance Department first?\u201dDamn! What was I saying? Stupid!\u201cNo need. Just leave it in your office first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Dong Xuebing sighed in his heart. \u201cI will leave now.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Xu Yan suddenly remembered something as Dong Xuebing was about to leave. \u201cOh, I heard from your Director Li Qing that other than Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei, you are also one of the nominees for the position of Deputy Chief?\u201dDong Xuebing was surprised.But before he could answer, Xu Yan waved him off. \u201cGo back to work. I will try to help you. But no promises.\u201dAh?Dong Xuebing had been waiting for Xu Yan to say this!He immediately thanked her!Hahaha!Dong Xuebing had gotten Xu Yan\u2019s crucial vote!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The air was filled with the cooking smell and was slightly choking. After getting a bowl of rice, Dong Xuebing sat down with Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi at a table near to the window. The most crucial Xu Yan\u2019s vote was settled. But it was too early to be happy. If no one else other than Deputy Chief Xu helps him, he will also not be able to compete with Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei.The first step was a success. Who should I target next?There were 4 more days to the meeting. Dong Xuebing must make full use of the remaining time to gather enough votes.After lunch, they got back to the office. Dong Xuebing analyze the situation. He has two targets in mind. One of them was lowly educated Deputy Bureau Chief Zhong. He was also one of the party committee members and was newly transferred to this branch. It seems that he still has not joined any factions in the bureau and was considered a \u201cneutral\u201d person. Dong Xuebing had heard Chief Yang Yizhong had been objective and never take sides during the past committee meetings. The other was Deputy Bureau, Chief Liu Hua. His connection was with the Ministry of State Security. He was only transferred to this branch temporarily. There were rumors that he will be transferred back in a few months. He is slightly younger and low profile. He had also not raised any objections to any decisions during the committee meetings. He was almost invisible during the meetings.Yes. It\u2019s the both of them!Dong Xuebing acted immediately. He pulled out his keyboard and start typing. He was writing the speech for Deputy Chief Yang for his next meeting. 3.05 pm. A simple and straight forward draft was completed. Dong Xuebing checked if there were any difficult characters in the draft before printing. He took the printout and went upstairs.\u201cDidn\u2019t I ask Xiao Wang to go? Why are you going to?\u201d\u201cChief Yang, I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGet Xiao Wang here immediately! What the hell are you all doing?\u201dDeputy Branch Bureau Chief Yang\u2019s scolding could be heard along the corridor. Dong Xuebing was not surprised and waited from a distance. He waited until a sullen staff member leaves the office. Dong Xuebing straightened his collar and knocked on the door. \u201cChief Yang, the draft for your speech is ready.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s Xiao Dong.\u201d Yang Yizhong attitude towards Dong Xuebing was much better. \u201cI need the script for my speech next month. There is no hurry.\u201dDong Xuebing pushed the draft forward lightly. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 I am afraid that the draft is not good enough and wanted to let you vet through it first. If you spot any mistakes, I will be able to amend it.\u201d\u201cThe previous speech you wrote was perfect. Fine. Let me take a look.\u201d Yang Yizhong took out the few copies of A4 paper and scanned through it. \u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026 hmmm\u2026\u2026 Not bad.\u201d After a while, he nodded and kept the draft in his drawer. \u201cThis is good enough. There is no need to amend anything. I will use this as my speech.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately said: \u201cThen is there any other documents or information you need?\u201dYang Yizhong thought for a while. \u201cOrganise and bring me the meeting minute for the no. 3 meeting room. I need all the minutes from the second half of the year.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. I will bring it to you before the end of the day.\u201dYang Yizhong laughed. \u201cThere is no hurry. Take your time. Oh, your General Affairs Office has two guys with the surname Guo\u2026\u2026. I can\u2019t remember their names.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cAre you referring to Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Those two guys.\u201d Yang Yizhong frowned. \u201cThis morning, I called your General Affairs Office to ask for some health promotion data. One person is enough to send this data to me. But why after the first person left, another person delivered the same documents to me again? Both of them still tried to hang around in my office. What kind of efficiency is this? They are just wasting my time! You go back and tell them not to come over to my office again. You will be the one who will deliver documents or anything to me!\u201dHahahaha! Serve them, right! Dong Xuebing almost burst out laughing. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201dGuo Panwei and Guo Shunjie should not have told each other that they will bring the documents to Yang Yizhong. Both of them were eager to show their faces to the leaders and caused this misunderstanding. There were only 3 candidates for the position of Deputy Chief. If Yang Yizhong was unhappy with the both of them, then he will surely support Dong Xuebing! After all, Yang Yizhong was pleased with his work performance after he accidentally found out Yang Yizhong had low education levels. Dong Xuebing had used back that time, and Yang Yizhong did not even know Dong Xuebing knew his secret.There should be no problem with Yang Yizhong\u2019s vote.2 votes in hand!The day ended.Dong Xuebing packed up his things and prepared to go home. From his office window, he saw Deputy Chief Liu Hua. He was about 35 or 36 years old and had a crewcut. He held his briefcase and walked slowly. He was the first person to finish work.\u201cChief Liu, are you going back?\u201d Yang Yizhong shouted. \u201cWant to have dinner together?\u201dLiu Hua turned and saw Yang Yizhong walking out of the grey building. He smiled: \u201cSome other time. I have plans tonight.\u201dYang Yizhong was not surprised. They exchanged a few words and walked out of the compound.In the office, after most people had left, Tan Limei laughed and said: \u201cChief Liu is still so low profile.\u201dZhuang Zhi asked: \u201cHow is he low profile?\u201dThe two Guos had left, and Tan Limei spoke without hesitation. \u201cAre you stupid? Since the day Chief Liu was transferred to the branch 1 year ago, have you ever seen him having a meal with anyone? Have you seen Chief Liu having personal conversations with any other leaders? Every morning, after Chief Liu arrives at work, he will remain inside his office until it was time to go home. He seldom leaves his office. He doesn\u2019t even take his lunch in the cafeteria.\u201dDong Xuebing was listening by the side.\u201cAlso, Chief Liu had never said anything during the Branch Bureau Chiefs and Party Committee meetings. Whenever there was a redeployment of manpower and the Deputies needed to vote and express their views, he will just give an abstention vote. Even when he was pointed out by Chief Yan, he would just give some excuses. He was just here to pass his time and did not want to get involved in anything else.\u201d Tan Limei thought for a while and said: \u201cHe is also not approachable like our Bureau Chief Yan. During festivals, he will not accept any gifts. Not even a pen or a book.\u201dDong Xuebing was surprised. \u201cReally?\u201dIt was normal in government agencies for cigarettes and liquor to be given as gifts during festivals, and it was weird to see anyone rejecting gifts.Tan Limei turned to Dong Xuebing angrily. \u201cYes! When I was new here, I brought a carton of cigarettes to Chief Liu\u2019s house as gifts during Chinese New Year. But Chief Liu doesn\u2019t even open his door for me to enter. He just told me to leave with my gifts and shut his door. I was so embarrassed then. Sigh\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s not talk about that.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded and pestered Tan Limei to tell him Chief Liu\u2019s address. After he got the address, he returned home.Dong Xuebing knew that Liu Hua was unapproachable, but he cannot afford to miss this opportunity.No matter what, Dong Xuebing must pay a visit to Liu Hua this evening.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dong Xuebing knew that if he were to show up unexpectedly empty-handed, it would not look nice on him. This was why he needs to get some gifts along the way. Since Liu Hua does not accept cigarettes and alcohol, then he can only give Liu Hua\u2019s wife some cosmetics. He hopes he will not be rejected.The housing estate was not big and have approximately 7 to 8 buildings.This was not the housing assigned to the families of the State Security agency, and there was no need to register before entering the estate. There was only a security guard standing outside, collecting parking fees.Dong Xuebing used his hand to tidy his hair and was about to enter the estate. But as he was about to enter, he saw a familiar figure from the corner of his eyes. It was Guo Shunjie. He was walking out of the housing estate carrying a bag of apples, and he looks gloomy. Dong Xuebing knew that he should be here to visit Liu Hua.Dong Xuebing quickly steps away from the entrance and hide behind a tree.Guo Shunjie was in a bad mood. As an old-timer in the General Affairs Office, he knew that Liu Hua does not accept gifts. Liu Hua did not even take his apples and asked him to leave. Huh? Could it be that Liu Hua saw the envelope with 10,000 RMB under the apples?Guo Shunjie was pissed, but he got over it after a while. If Liu Hua did not entertain him, then Liu Hua will also not side with Guo Panwei. This will do it. As long as Liu Hua continues to be the \u2018abstention vote\u2019 of the committee meetings, then Guo Panwei will not be able to win him. He will be the next Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office!Dong Xuebing walked out from behind the tree as Guo Shunjie disappeared from a distance. He hesitated for a moment, but still walk into the estate.Unit 1, level 5.Dong Xuebing took a deep breath and pressed the doorbell of unit 501.Ding Dong, Ding Dong. The door opened, and Liu Hua asked: \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201dDong Xuebing was nervous and immediately say: \u201cChief Liu, you might not know who I am I am Dong Xuebing from the General Affairs Department. I had wanted to pay you a visit during the October holidays, but Director Li\u2019s office caught fire and I was injured and hospitalized.\u201d Dong Xuebing mentioned his credit for saving the precious documents from Li Qing\u2019s office. He wanted to see if Liu Hua knows about him.Liu Hua looked at Dong Xuebing blankly and nodded.Seeing Liu Hua not saying a word, Dong Xuebing smiled embarrassedly and lifted the shopping bag he was carrying. \u201cThis is for aunty. It is not anything costly. Please accept it.\u201d Dong Xuebing opened the shopping bag to show him. Although from Liu Hua\u2019s age, his wife should be at least 10 years older than Dong Xuebing. But Liu Hua was a leader, and it was not wrong to address his wife as aunty.Liu Hua frowned and replied. \u201cThanks for the gift, but please take it back.\u201dDong Xuebing was not giving up so easily. \u201cChief Liu, I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTake it away.\u201d Liu Hua pushed Dong Xuebing\u2019s hands away impatiently.Dong Xuebing sighed in his heart. Seem like it will not be an easy task to pull Liu Hua over to his side. Sighed\u2026\u2026 I am too na\u00efve to think that giving some gifts to Liu Hua\u2019s wife will let me get closer to him. It was not so simple to get his favors. He did not even let me into his house.Sighed\u2026\u2026 What should I do now?Dong Xuebing knew that it was impossible for Liu Hua to not have any desires. Everyone will wish to have something they wanted. If only he knew what Liu Hua wants\u2026\u2026For example, Yang Yizhong wanted status and does not want others to know that he did not know a lot of Chinese characters. This was why Dong Xuebing was able to write his speech and let Yang Yizhong have a favorable impression of him.For example, Zhou Changchun. He likes to play shares and wants to be respected. When Dong Xuebing helped him to play stocks and gave him respect after he retires, Dong Xuebing was nominated by him to take over his position. Li Qing needs to escape the responsibility of his office fire incident. This was why he had a favorable impression of Dong Xuebing when Dong Xuebing helped him to retrieve the important documents from the fire. Xu Yan wants to win over her rival. So, when Dong Xuebing helped her win the soccer match, she trusted him.But\u2026\u2026 What does Liu Hua want?What should I do to know what he wants badly?Ring, ring, ring. Liu Hua\u2019s phone, in his pocket, rang.Liu Hua looked at the caller display and answered: \u201cHello? Brother-in-law? Oh\u2026\u2026 I am at home\u2026 Really? Is dad the one who says this or is it mom? Ok\u2026\u2026 Which day? Fine\u2026 Ok\u2026 Yes\u2026\u201d He held his phone with one hand and took out a small notebook with the other from his pocket. He wrote something in his notebook and said: \u201cOk. I have jolted it down. I still have something to do now. Bye.\u201dDong Xuebing stared at the notebook in a daze.People will forget things when they were busy. Many leaders have the habit of taking notes to prevent forgetting their task. These notebooks were essential to them. It was like their personal diary and will typically not let others see its contents.Will Liu Hua records what he really wanted in that notebook?Possible! If Liu Hua likes to play shares, then he will definitely record the share prices and codes in that notebook. If Liu Hua has something that is troubling him, it might not be recorded in the notebook. But from the tone and things he recorded, one should be able to guess it. If Dong Xuebing was able to know what Liu Hua needed, then he will know what to do.After hanging up the phone, Liu Hua looked at Dong Xuebing. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201dIt was almost impossible for others to look into their leaders\u2019 privacy.But for Dong Xuebing, this was not a problem.Dong Xuebing immediately snatched the notebook from Liu Hua\u2019s hand!Liu Hua was shocked and shouted: \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dDong Xuebing ignored him and start to flip that notebook.\u201cHow come the General Affairs Office have such people? Fine! I will remember you!\u201d Liu Hua did not try to take back his notebook and start to make a phone call. \u201cHello, is this Chief Xu? Is there someone by the name of Dong Xuebing in your department? You should see what he is doing now! He snatched my notebook without my permission\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing closed the notebook and shouted: \u201cBACK!\u201d\u2026\u2026The scenes changed!\u201cOk. I have jolted it down. I still have something to do now. Bye.\u201dLiu Hua kept his phone and asked: \u201cIs there anything else?\u201dDong Xuebing replied politely: \u201cSorry to disturb you today.\u201dAfter leaving the estate, Dong Xuebing recalled what was written in the notebook.There was nothing important written on the last page. Liu Hua only wrote dinner on the 15th at Wangfu Restaurant, needs to buy beansprout and spinach after work. Meeting at 2 pm, etc. Dong Xuebing remembered a critical word on the second last page of the notebook. Lion Head!15 pages from the last page: These few years I had let Tian Tian suffered. I must treat her better in the future.10 pages from the last page: Tian Tian had searched all over Beijing, and no one was willing to sell. She really wanted the Lion Head. 4 sixes Lion Head.8 pages from the last page: Buy Lion Head for Tian Tian.7 pages from the last page: Buy a Lion Head for next month\u2019s wedding anniversary. 46.5 pages from the last page: There are only 10 days left. Must get a 46 Lion Head!The second line of the page, 3 pages from the last page: Today I must go there again! I don\u2019t believe that I cannot find it!The first line of the page, 2 pages from the last: There is no more time. First thing after work. Lion Head!Tian Tian should be Liu Hua\u2019s wife, and Liu Hua should be searching for a wedding anniversary gift for his wife. But Dong Xuebing was confused. Lion Head? What the hell was that? Wasn\u2019t Lion Head a dish\u2019s name? Aunt Xuan had just cooked this dish a few days ago. It was just minced meat made into a meatball and cooked with cabbage. What\u2019s so difficult about making this Lion Head? Dong Xuebing also know how to cook this dish. What\u2019s 46? 4 sixes? Damn! There was no way for a table full of people to finish 46 Lion Head. Also, who will give their partners food on their wedding anniversary?It should not be that Lion Head dish!Dong Xuebing was deep in thoughts, thinking what this Lion Head means.Suddenly, Dong Xuebing stopped in the middle of the pavement and slapped his forehead!Dong Xuebing ah, Dong Xuebing\u2026\u2026 you had worked part-time at the antique market for so many years! Are you dumb? You don\u2019t even know what a Lion Head is?Dong Xuebing finally figure out what Liu Hua wanted!Beijing people like to collect walnuts, and Lion Head was the most expensive category of walnut. The 4 sixes written in the notebook did not mean forty-six or 6666. It was a jargon in the walnut collectors\u2019 community. It stands for 4.6 cm in length.This means that Liu Hua wanted to find a pair of 4.6 cm Lion Head walnuts as a gift to his wife on his wedding anniversary!Dong Xuebing should be happy to figure this out. But he was frowning and troubled.Lion Head was the top tier collector\u2019s item in the Walnut collection. It was in the same category as the Tiger Head and Scholar Hat, but it was more valuable. A pair of 40mm Lion Head was already scarce. 44mm and 45mm Lion Head were even harder to find, and it cost more than 10,000 RMB for a pair!Liu Hua wanted 46mm Lion Head?!46 and 45 were entirely different. You might not even find one 46 mm walnut in two walnut trees, let alone a pair. It was too difficult!Even if someone owns a pair of this 46 Lion Head, they will also not sell it!Damn! Where can I find a pair of 46mm Lion Head?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In his dreams, he was in the middle of a field, and he could smell the scent of flowers. But suddenly, there was a storm and the whole world was flooded and he was drowning in flood. He could not breathe and was struggling to swim\u2026\u2026 Then, he woke up and saw Qu Yunxuan\u2019s face in front of him. She was pinching Dong Xuebing\u2019s nose and smiling. \u201cWhat did you dream? Why are you grinning like a fool?\u201d Both of them grew closer over the past few weeks and had exchanged keys to their home. This was why Dong Xuebing was not surprised to see Qu Yunxuan in his room.Dong Xuebing rubbed his nose. \u201cI thought I had drowned when I couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed and knocked his head. \u201cBreakfast is ready.\u201dAfter she left, Dong Xuebing got dressed and saw that shopping bag of cosmetics. He remembered that the gifts he prepared for Liu Hua\u2019s wife were still with him. He rubbed his nose and thought for a while, before bringing the bag out to the living room. He looked at Qu Yunxuan, who was bent over wiping the windowsills: \u201cEh, you don\u2019t need to do this. I will wipe it later. Aunt Xuan, can you come over for a minute? Do you need these cosmetics?\u201dQu Yunxuan was surprised. \u201cWhy are you buying things for me again?\u201dDong Xuebing did not lie: \u201cActually, I had bought these for my leader\u2019s wife. But he did not accept my gifts.\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at him, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare to lie to you. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d Dong Xuebing passed the bag over.Qu Yunxuan stared at him and look into the shopping bag. \u201cL'Oreal? Elizabeth Arden? These are expensive stuff.\u201d Qu Yunxuan laughed. \u201cYou really know about cosmetics. All these are the stuff I can use. I was still thinking of buying cosmetics next week. Fine. I will accept these.\u201d\u201cOk. Let\u2019s have breakfast.\u201d\u201cI have just eaten, and I need to go to the New agency. You go ahead.\u201d\u201cToday is Saturday. Are you working overtime again?\u201d\u201cYes. If I can clinch these 2 deals today, I will be able to get high commission. I will buy some nice clothing for you if I get it.\u201d Qu Yunxuan finished up cleaning the windows and grab her handbag from the sofa. \u201cOk, I am off to work. I might be having dinner with my clients this evening and will be late.\u201dDong Xuebing knew that Qu Yunxuan was working hard to save up enough to set up her own business. But it was not easy to save 1 million RMB. Dong Xuebing was worried that she would tire herself out before she reaches her goal. He decided to think of ways to earn some money after this Deputy Chief selection was over.9 am. Dong Xuebing went to the bank to withdraw 20,000 RMB and took a bus to Panjiayuan.Although he was not confident of finding the 46 mm Lion Head, he still wanted to try.Panjiayuan, Beijing Antique Market.This market was located at the southeast of Beijing\u2019s 3rd Ring Road. It was China\u2019s biggest antique market, and all sorts of antiques could be found there. There were more than 3,000 stalls there and were set up by people from all the various provinces in China. Other than the food products, there were all sorts of goods. It was like a museum and had attracted tourists from all over the world. It was the playground for antique collectors.The morning was the busiest time for this antique market. Today was a Saturday, and the crowd was more significant than other days.Dong Xuebing looked around the market and head towards the west. He entered a shop specializing in selling collectible Walnuts and walnuts craving. He had worked in a porcelain shop nearby and knew where the walnuts shops were located. \u201cBoss, do you have Lion Heads?\u201dThe man in the shop replied. \u201cYes, what type do you want?\u201d\u201c46.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The shop owner shook his head. \u201cI do not have those.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind about the colors or have slight defects, as long as it is 46.\u201dThe shop owner shook his head. \u201c46 is too rare. It is too difficult to find a single piece, let alone a pair. If I have a pair of 46, I will also not sell it. I will keep it for my own collection.\u201dDong Xuebing sighed and left the shop for the next shop.\u201cBoss, do you have 46 Lion Head?\u201d\u201cOh, the biggest pair I have here is 44 Tiger. Do you want to see it?\u201d\u201cNevermind. Thanks.\u201dDong Xuebing went to 4 shops and could not even find a single 46 Lion Head!Dong Xuebing sighed and said to himself. \u201cI knew it. If it can be found so easily, Liu Hua would have bought it a long time ago.\u201dWhen Dong Xuebing was about to return home, he heard someone shouting.\u201cCome and see. Chicken Heart, 200 RMB a pair. Lion Head from Panshan, 400 RMB for a pair.\u201dThere was a big crowd around a walnut stall not far away.Dong Xuebing squeezed his way through the crowd to the front. This stall was not selling the finished walnut products. It was selling the green walnut fruits. There were a few baskets of walnut fruits on the floor, and 5 to 6 hands were choosing the fruits. The business was bustling. The secretion from the walnut fruit will turn black after it was exposed to air. The stall owner\u2019s hands were like coal miners. He used a small knife to cut the skin of the walnut fruit and shouts to attract customers.Dong Xuebing was familiar with this.This was walnut gambling.These walnut fruits were plucked from the trees before they were ripe. The species of walnut from this region, Shilihe, were mainly Scholar Hats, Chicken Hearts, Tiger Head, and the top-grade Lion Head. There was no way to tell how the seeds look like from the exterior of the walnut fruit. This was why it was called Walnut gambling. It was all based on luck. This type of gambling started a few years ago, and it was very popular in Beijing.Tiger Head walnut season started earlier, and the fruits will not be available by the end of the month. The walnut fruits now were mainly Lion Head.Walnut gambling?!Dong Xuebing was deep in thoughts. Although these fruits sold by this seller were not high-grade fruits, there should be exceptional. While working part-time in the past, he had seen an old man opened up two walnut fruits, and it formed a pair of 44mm Tiger Head. Since 46mm Lion Head could not be found in any of the shops here, should I try my luck in Walnut gambling? What if 46mm Lion Head could really be found in this basket of fruits?No. This should not be luck. There were so many walnut fruits in Panjiayuan, and there should be at least a pair of 46mm Lion Head.But how should I get it?From the exterior of the fruits, there was no way to see the size of the seed inside\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDong Xuebing stood in front of the walnut stall silently.The stall owner was still shouting to attract customers: \u201cThis year\u2019s big Chicken Hearts are good. Come and try your luck!\u201dSomeone in the crowd picked a pair of walnut fruits over: \u201cI want this pair.\u201d\u201cOk!\u201d The wife of the stall owner took 200 RMB from that person and threw it into a plastic basket. She took out a small knife and start to cut away the flesh of the green color fruits. Soon, the flesh and skin of the fruit were cut away, and she washes the seed in a pail of clear water and starts to scrub away the remaining flesh with a plastic brush. After cleaning the seed, she took out a ruler and measure the seed. She said loudly. \u201cThe seed has some dark spots, and one of them is 37, and the other is 39. It\u2019s not a pair.\u201d This size was average, and the seeds must be at least 42mm to worth something. The dark spot on the fruit was considered blemish, and even if the seed was big, but dark spots will lower the value.After hearing these, that buyer turned and walk away.Soon, another person bought a pair of Lion Head fruits, and the seeds were 39 mm and 41mm. These were not good too.After that, someone opened a pair of 36mm and 38mm seeds.The next person got 40mm and 39mm. This was considered a pair.After standing there for a while, Dong Xuebing gave up the idea of trying his luck. So many people had bought these fruits, and there was not even one that is more than 42mm. The chances of a 46mm appearing were even slimmer. He knew that even if lady luck was on his side, it was also near to impossible.But Dong Xuebing was not willing to give up.10 minutes\u2026\u202630 minutes\u2026\u20261 hour\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing stood in front of the stall for almost 2 hours. The walnut fruits were getting lesser and lesser.There were at least 100 Lion Head walnut fruits, and now, there were less than 30 remainings. One basket of Chicken Heart walnut fruits was sold in less than 2 hours. The stall owner brought a new basket from the back of the stall. The business was bustling for the stall owner. But Dong Xuebing still have not seen any Lion Head that was more than 44mm. The biggest that appeared was 43.8mm. But after the seeds were dried, it will shrink slightly, and the finished product should be at most 43mm.These were too small!All the seeds were too small!At noon, Dong Xuebing went to KFC to have his lunch before returning back to the stall.10\u2026\u202620\u2026\u202650\u2026\u2026At 4pm, Dong Xuebing was exhausted. Not only his eyes were blurry, but his legs were also numbed.At this time, there were lesser people, and the stall owner\u2019s wife looked at Dong Xuebing and asked with a northeast accent. \u201cYoung man, do you want to try your luck?\u201d She had noticed Dong Xuebing standing there since morning. He was standing there for almost 8 hours and did not even buy one fruit.Dong Xuebing thought for a while and shook his head.There was one person who won a 44.7mm seed. But it was a far cry from Dong Xuebing\u2019s target of 46mm.Sighed\u2026\u2026 the chances were too slim. Time to leave?It was getting late, and Dong Xuebing decided to watch the last pair of fruit cutting before leaving.\u201cHow much for these Lion Head?\u201d A big sized man squats down and examines the fruits.The stall owner replied: \u201cNormal Panshan Lion Head is 400 RMB a pair. The bigger fruits are more expensive. There are 600 and 1,000 RMB types.\u201dThere were not many Lion Head fruits remaining in the basket. The man scrutinized the fruits carefully. After a while, he picked two yellowish and brownish fruits from the left of the basket and threw it to the stall owner. \u201cI will buy these two. Open it!\u201d The fruits were yellowish was because it had been plucked from the tree for some time. Even if the fruits were kept refrigerated, it will also not last long. But it will not affect the quality of the seeds.\u201cThese two are bigger, and they cost 800 RMB.\u201dThe man took out his money and paid the stall owner. \u201cOpen it!\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d The stall owner held the fruit with his black colored hand and start to slice open the fruit.The first Lion Head seed appeared in front of everybody. 43.3mm. It was considered slightly above average.That man was satisfied and nodded. \u201cCarry on! See if it is a pair!\u201dThe stall owner starts to slice the other fruit.First cut\u2026\u2026Second cut\u2026\u2026Third cut\u2026\u2026\u201cEh! Look! That seed\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWow! It\u2019s big!\u201d The crowd starts to stir.Dong Xuebing was also stunned. He stared at the half-open fruit. Although he did not measure the seed with a ruler, he knew that the seed in this fruit was very big!The stall owner was also surprised. He did not continue cutting the fruit and took a ruler to measure the diameter. He was shocked, and he looked at his wife. \u201cIt is nearly 47mm. 46.8!\u201dDong Xuebing was excited. What? 46.8mm? Even if the seed were dried, it would also be 46mm!Damn! Isn\u2019t this the Lion Head I was looking for? It really appeared!\u201cHi, excuse me.\u201d Dong Xuebing was worried that someone else would make an offer. He immediately asked that man. \u201cAre you willing to sell this 46 Lion Head? Name a price.\u201dThat man laughed. \u201cI am not selling it! I want to keep it for my own collection!\u201dDong Xuebing anxiously said. \u201cThis is also not a pair. It is also not worth collecting. Can you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you I am not selling!\u201d That man waved Dong Xuebing away and told the stall owner: \u201cHurry up and open it!\u201dWhat should I do? What should I do now?Dong Xuebing was panicking. He had finally found what he was waiting for. If he missed this opportunity\u2026\u2026Oh! Damn! I even forgot about it!BACK!!!\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing felt slight giddiness, and the scenes around him changed!\u201cHow much for these Lion Head?\u201dThe stall owner replied: \u201cNormal Panshan Lion Head is 400 RMB a pair. The bigger fruits are more expensive. There are 600 and 1,000 RMB types.\u201dThe big sized man extended his arm to pick those two big yellowish fruits on the left of the basket!Dong Xuebing immediately leaned forward and grabbed those two yellowish fruits. \u201cI want this pair! Boss! Help me cut it!\u201d Dong Xuebing had noticed the yellowish and slightly rotten fruits from earlier. He was sure that the ones in his hands were the same as earlier.That man frowned and look at Dong Xuebing. He thought to himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d He moved aside and looked at the fruits on the right of the basket.The stall owner looked at the fruits in Dong Xuebing\u2019s hand. \u201c800 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately paid him. His heart was beating very fast.Please, don\u2019t let the seeds have blemishes! The seeds must not be damaged by insects\u2026\u2026 Please!The stall owner had started to cut away the flesh of the first fruit.First cut\u2026\u2026Second cut\u2026\u2026Third cut\u2026\u2026Soon, the crowd stirred. A Lion Head had appeared!There were no blemishes and no dark spots!46.8mm!!!The big sized man grumbled under him breath. Damn!The stall owner and his wife were shocked by this young man. This young man had been standing there from the morning and did not even buy a single fruit. The moment he buys, a 46mm appeared! He could spot the difference between the walnut fruits?! Impossible! The stall owner had been selling walnut fruits for years and could not tell the difference from the exterior!Dong Xuebing took a deep breath as he held the big Lion Head in his hand.Hahaha! Finally!Dong Xuebing had finally gotten 1 46mm Lion Head!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although there were not many antiques sold here like Panjiayuen, there were lots of stalls selling birds, fishes, and walnuts.Dong Xuebing strolled along the market and visited almost every stall selling walnuts. Then, he stood beside a makeshift booth and watch people gamble walnut fruits. He had already gotten a 46mm Lion Head and was confident that he would be able to \u201csnatch\u201d another 46 mm Lion Head from someone else with his ability. Now, he only lacks one more 46 mm Lion Head. He wanted to repeat what he did yesterday.Please appear! Hurry up and appear!One hour\u2026\u2026Two hours\u2026\u2026It was almost noon, and there was not even a 45mm Lion Head.After lunch, Dong Xuebing was anxious. He went to another stall and stood there and wait. Why didn\u2019t any 46mm Lion Head appear? Tomorrow will be on Monday. This month\u2019s committee meeting will undoubtedly be held on either Monday or Tuesday. If I can\u2019t find the second 46mm Lion Head, then I will not be able to get a pair. It will not be in time for tomorrow\u2019s meeting!10 minutes\u2026\u2026 20 minutes\u2026\u2026 Soon, half an hour passed.Just when Dong Xuebing was about to give up, he heard shouting near to him.\u201cWow! 46!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really a 446 Lion Head!\u201d\u201cHehehe. That\u2019s luck!\u201dDong Xuebing was excited and turned towards the direction of the shouting. It was also a walnut stall. But it was a small stall. Without hesitation, Dong Xuebing ran over to the booth and pushed the onlookers aside. \u201cExcuse me! Excuse me! There is the 46 Lion Head? How big is it? Is it more than 46.8mm?\u201dIf the walnut seed were not more than 46.8 or 46.9mm, it would not be 46 mm after it was dried.The stall owner heard someone asking and replied: \u201cIt\u2019s 46.6mm.\u201dDong Xuebing frowned. Although it was not as big as the one he got yesterday, but it should be able to meet the minimum requirement to form a pair. He turned and look at the person who bought the fruit. It was a high school student. \u201cHi, can you let me have a look at your walnut seed?\u201dThat boy was very excited and showed it to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing examined the Lion Head and then compared it to his from a picture he took from his iPhone this morning. He compared the bottom, middle section, the top, etc. Hmmm\u2026\u2026. it was not a perfect pair, but it should be enough.An onlooker also said: \u201cCan I see it too?\u201dDong Xuebing passed the Lion Head back to that boy and asked: \u201cAre you willing to selling it? Name me a price.\u201d Dong Xuebing did not see which fruit this boy picked earlier, and it was useless for him to use BACK. If he uses BACK, he could buy out the whole basket of fruits. But when Dong Xuebing looked at the basket, there were at least a few hundred fruits. If one fruit cost 300 RMB, then it will cost more than 100,000 RMB for the whole basket. He only had 50,000 RMB with him!That high school student wore branded goods from head to toe. He doesn\u2019t seem to lack money. \u201cSorry, I do not want to sell.\u201dOther than Dong Xuebing, someone among the crowd was also interested in that Lion Head. \u201cHow about 3,000 RMB?\u201cI will offer 4,000 RMB! Do you want to sell?\u201dDong Xuebing panicked and said: \u201cI will offer 5,000 RMB!\u201d For only a single Lion Head, 5,000 RMB was a high price.But that boy shook his head. \u201cI am not selling, but\u2026\u2026\u201d He paused for a while. \u201cI am looking for a pair of 46mm Chicken Heart. If anyone of you here has it, I am willing to exchange the pair for this Lion Head.\u201d46mm Chicken Heart?Although Chicken Heart could not be compared to Lion Head, 46mm Chicken Heart was also rare!The two men who shouted earlier hesitated. Dong Xuebing gritted his teeth and said: \u201cWait for me here. I will go and get you a pair!\u201d Dong Xuebing must get this Lion Head at all cost. Furthermore, all the Chicken Hearts above 42mm in the market were all from artificial grafting, and there was an abundance of fruits available. The value of 3 pairs of 46mm Chicken Hearts could not even be compared to 1 Lion Head. This was a good deal!That high school boy smiled and replied. \u201cOk. I will wait for you here.\u201d\u201cI will reserve your Lion Heart!\u201d Someone from the crowd shouted. \u201cYoung man don\u2019t sell it to others. I will bring you the Chicken Heart!\u201dDong Xuebing panicked. \u201cI am the one who said first!\u201dThe High school boy paused for a while and said: \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 how about I exchange it with the first person who brings the Chicken Heart over?\u201d\u201cOk!\u201dDong Xuebing immediately ran to a nearby walnut store and asked: \u201cDo you have 46 Chicken Heart?\u201dThe store owner replied: \u201cNo. Do you want 44mm Chicken Heart?\u201dDong Xuebing left and ran to the next store. \u201cGive me a pair of 46mm Chicken Hearts!\u201d\u201cOh, we do not have 46mm Chicken Hearts.\u201dAfter asking 3 stores, Dong Xuebing realized something. Damn, even if I visited all the stores, it will also be useless. If it were available in these stores, that high school boy would have bought it from them and not asked to exchange his 46 Lion Head. I am so stupid! But\u2026\u2026 where should I find this Chicken Heart?Suddenly there was a loud sound of things dropping on the ground behind Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing turned around and saw a young man in his mid-twenties, placing a basket of walnut fruits under a big umbrella. That young man made a few trips into a store and carried out baskets of walnut fruits. Then he started shouting. \u201cCome and see. Green fruits! Big Chicken Heart, Lion Head. All fresh from these two days!\u201d That young man\u2019s store was not specialized in selling walnuts. It was a small store selling pet foods.Dong Xuebing heard \u201cBig Chicken Heart\u201d and his eyes brighten up.This store had just opened, and Dong Xuebing was the only person there. That young man looked at Dong Xuebing and asked: \u201cHi, do you want to buy a pair?\u201dDong Xuebing suddenly had an idea. Big Chicken Heart was not like Lion Head. The chance of 45 and 46mm appearing was much higher. Since 46mm Chicken Hearts were not available in stores, why not try his luck at gambling? If Dong Xuebing was lucky, he should get a pair of 46mm Chicken Hearts from dozens of fruits! But this method will be costly!Fine! That\u2019s what I will do!To get the position of Deputy Chief, this amount was nothing!I will take a gamble!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

People were approaching him and looking at his 46mm Lion Head. They will speak for a while and that High School Boy shook his head. He should be telling them that he did not want to sell this Lion Head. He only wants to exchange it for a pair of Chicken Heart.Dong Xuebing knew that he could not waste any more time. He moved towards the nearest basket in front of him and asked that young man. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Chicken Heart and Lion Head fruits all looked the same. They were all round and green in color. Dong Xuebing could not tell the difference from the exterior of the fruits.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 Hang on for a while.\u201d That young man took out some cut Chicken Heart fruits and Lion Head fruits and place it in front of the baskets. \u201cThis is\u2026\u2026. Errr\u2026\u2026 Chicken Heart. 200 RMB for a pair.\u201d That young man pointed to another basket and said: \u201cThat basket is Lion Head. Some are 700 RMB for a pair, and the bigger ones are 1,000 RMB a pair.\u201dDong Xuebing looked at the green colored fruits in the Chicken Heart basket and picked 4 pairs. \u201cI will take these. Please hurry and cut it open. I only want to see the size of the seed inside. Don\u2019t need to scrub it. You can clean the seed later.\u201d Dong Xuebing said and passed 800 RMB to that young man.But when the young man started cutting the fruit, Dong Xuebing regretted buying from this stall. That young man was a newbie, and he was too slow. He took a long time to cut away the flesh of the fruit.Damn! He is damn slow!Dong Xuebing wanted to hurry him, but something caught his eye.Dong Xuebing saw a man passing a pair of walnuts to that High School boy. That High School boy looked at the walnuts and nodded. He then gives his 46mm Lion Head to that man and left.Damn!Dong Xuebing was pissed. He stood up and walked towards that High School Boy. \u201cYou exchanged your Lion Head?\u201dThe High School Boy smiled and showed the pair of walnuts in his hand. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a pair of 46mm Chicken Heart.\u201dDamn. I wasted my time.Dong Xuebing was feeling frustrated. He saw the Lion Head was no longer with this High School Boy and there was no point asking him anymore. He turned back to that young man and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Just cut a pair. I don\u2019t want the rest.\u201d Dong Xuebing knew it was pointless to carry on gambling Chicken Heart fruits.That young man frowned: \u201cDon\u2019t want? You said you wanted 4 pairs and we don\u2019t do refunds here!\u201dWho asked you to cut the fruits slowly? If you can expose the seed with two cuts and a pair of 46 mm Chicken Hearts appeared, I would be able to exchange that Lion Head! Dong Xuebing was pissed. \u201cThe other fruits are still not cut.\u201d\u201cEven if it is not cut, you also cannot return it to me.\u201d That young man firmly replied. \u201cAre you trying to create trouble?\u201dDong Xuebing frowned. He could not be bothered with this young man. \u201cThen hurry up and cut all the fruits.\u201dThat young man continued to cut the fruit open.1 cut\u2026\u2026.2 cuts\u2026\u2026The flesh of the fruit was slowly cut away, exposing the seed.Dong Xuebing could not be bothered. It was only a few hundred RMB. He was thinking about where to look for the other 46 Lion Head.When the seed of the fruit was exposed, that young man, Dong Xuebing and some onlookers were shocked.The seed was not big. It was about 37mm. But the shape and texture were not Chicken Heart!It was Lion Head!An onlooker asked: \u201cOh, did you make a mistake? This person had bought Chicken Heart.\u201dAnother onlooker said: \u201cThe price difference between Chicken Heart and Lion Head is several times!\u201dThat young man\u2019s face changed and shouted to his father who was in the pet food store. \u201cDad, come out. Did you place the wrong fruits in the basket?\u201d He immediately picked up and cut another fruit picked by Dong Xuebing.Lion Head!It was another Lion Head fruit!That young man\u2019s father ran towards the stall and looked at the fruits closely. After examining the fruits, he roared: \u201cYou fool! I had said many times yesterday! That is the basket for Lion Head! Why did not put the Chicken Hearts in there?\u201d They had just started this walnut gambling business, and this was a newbie mistake.Dong Xuebing laughed to himself. This was unexpected. He looked at the father scolding his son and pointed to the remaining Chicken Heart\u2026\u2026 No\u2026\u2026 It should be Lion Head fruits. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you carry on cutting the remaining fruits?\u201dThat young man looked at Dong Xuebing with a long face. \u201cIt was a mistake. These are not Chicken Heart. Your 800 RMB can only open a pair.\u201dDong Xuebing raised his brows: \u201cI had paid for 4 pairs earlier.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you trying to take advantage of me?\u201d That young man stared at Dong Xuebing. \u201cWhere can you find a pair of Lion Head selling for 200 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing folded his arms: \u201cI wanted a refund earlier, and you refused. You said that 4 pairs mean 4 pairs. Fine. Now, I don\u2019t want to the refund, and you claim that I am creating trouble and can only give me a pair? Hahaha. You set all the rules? This is considered cheating!\u201d Actually, this was a minor mistake. But Dong Xuebing was pissed with this young man\u2019s attitude. This was that young man\u2019s fault, and he should apologize. Dong Xuebing will also not argue with him over a few hundred RMB.That young man\u2019s father stared at Dong Xuebing: \u201cWho is cheating? Watch your mouth!\u201dThe young man also stared at Dong Xuebing: \u201cI have never met someone like you!\u201dFuck!Dong Xuebing was already pissed, and he scoffed. \u201cWatch what I am saying? Fine. You all are asking for it!\u201dThat young man responded with a hmph and said: \u201cWhat do you want to do? Report to the police?

You said you wanted 4 pairs and we don\u2019t do refunds here!\u201dDong Xuebing immediately knew where the conversation had stopped. \u201cThe other fruits are still not cut.\u201d\u201cEven if it is not cut, you also cannot return it to me.\u201d That young man firmly replied. \u201cAre you trying to create trouble?\u201d The young man replied. He was not willing to make any refunds.Dong Xuebing smiled and nodded. \u201cFine. Then you stop cutting the fruit!\u201dThat young man stared at Dong Xuebing. \u201cYou want to cut the fruits yourself? Fine. Here are the fruits you picked. I will not refund you a single cent.\u201d\u201cWhat is wrong with you? Who does business with such an attitude?\u201d Dong Xuebing was not angry, and he laughed. \u201cI can't be bothered to argue with you. Put those 8 walnut fruits back into the basket and count the total number of fruits in the basket. I will buy the whole basket of Chicken Hearts!\u201dThat young man thought he had misheard. \u201cHuh? You want the whole basket?\u201d Hahaha, was this person crazy?The crowd starts to stir. \u201cWhat is this person doing? He might as well go and reserved a walnut tree.\u201dDong Xuebing ignored that young man and bend over to count the fruits. \u201c1\u2026 2\u2026 3\u2026 4\u2026 5\u2026\u201d Within minutes, both the young man and Dong Xuebing finished counting the number of fruits.

Here are the remaining. Check it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ok. The amount is right.\u201d The young man was overjoyed.

Who would change his mind within seconds?Dong Xuebing was worried that the young man would go after him and he did not take the bus. He flagged a taxi and went back home.Dong Xuebing placed the basket of walnut fruits in his living room and took off his shoes excitedly. \u201cWas this consider a lucky find? Hahaha! That\u2019s right! It\u2019s time to cut these fruits! Let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a 46mm here! 200 fruits!

A short Lion Head appeared. Dong Xuebing took a ruler from his room to measure the seed.41mm. Dong Xuebing smiled and put that Lion Head aside. He returned to the toilet and start to cut another fruit. He was still worried that if the fruit opened by that young man was placed into this basket by mistake and the rest were all Chicken Heart.Lion Head!Lion Head!Lion Head again!Dong Xuebing was assured after Lion Head appeared for 4 times.After a while, the old toothbrush could not be used to clean the seeds as the hairs were frayed. Dong Xuebing threw it away and found a shoe brush from his shoe cabinet to replace it.Dong Xuebing spent the rest of the day cutting those fruits.7\u2026\u20269\u2026\u202613\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing prayed while he cut the fruits.

Some blemishes.Dong Xuebing did not feel tired or feel this was a mundane task. He had hoped for every fruit he cut. He was even getting better at cutting these fruits. He could easily cut away all the flesh of fruit within one minute!Beep, beep. It was a message.Dong Xuebing wiped his hands and swipe across his iPhone 4. It was a message from Qu Yunxuan. She told him that she will not be cooking dinner as she got to stay back after work. Dong Xuebing replied, \u201cOk.\u201d and looked at the time. He wiped his sweat and said to himself. \u201cI will have dinner after this fruit.\u201d1 cut!2 cuts!3 cuts!This was the 55th fruit.The seed of this fruit was exposed!Dong Xuebing continued to cut away the skin and flesh of the fruit.

His heart was racing, and he even dropped his knife!This\u2026\u2026This\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing quickly picked up the knife again and cut the remaining flesh of the fruit away. He quickly picks up the brush and starts to clean the seed.Then he picked up the ruler and measured\u2026\u2026 46.8mm!This was a 46.8mm Lion Head!Dong Xuebing cried out in joy and immediately ran to his room to take out the 46mm Lion Head he got yesterday to compare.

He carried all the walnut seeds to his living room.His hands were cramping from the cutting, and he sat there panting.These Lion Heads\u2019 colors were above average, but not a lot of them were big. There was the only one that\u2019s above 46mm, and a lot of them were average size, around 40 to 41mm. After resting for a while, Dong Xuebing started the last step of the process. Pairing up the seeds. The worth of these walnuts still depends on identical pairs and the size was not that important.Dong Xuebing sifted through every seed.8.10pm: A pair of 38mm Lion Head was matched.8.15pm: A pair of 40mm Lion Head was matched8.16pm: A pair of 36.5mm and 36.9mm Lion Head was matched8.17pm: A pair of 43mm and 43.3mm Lion Head was matchedAbout an hour later, the pairing and matching process was completed. Other than a dozen walnuts with insect bites and blemishes, the rest of the walnuts were paired. The best pairs were a pair of 45mm Lion Head and a pair of 44mm and 44.5mm. The worst pair was a pair of 35mm and 36mmm.This was great!Dong Xuebing knew that these pairs were able to fetch good prices!After resting for a few minutes, Dong Xuebing immediately packed the pairs of Lion Heads into plastic bags and kept it into his mother\u2019s luggage bag. He did not have enough bags and got to go out to buy some. After all the Lion Heads were packed, he dragged the luggage bag downstairs and walked along the road towards the north. There was a walnut shop near Heping Street.Good, the shop was still open.Dong Xuebing walked into the shop and saw 2 to 3 customers. The store owner was introducing a pair of Lion Head to the customers. From the packaging, this pair should be at least more than 10 years. It was a rare pair.The store owner saw Dong Xuebing and asked: \u201cAre you looking for walnuts? Are you getting it as a gift or for your own collection? What\u2019s the size you are looking for?\u201dDong Xuebing asked: \u201cDo you accept walnuts? Paired walnuts?The store owner blinked: \u201cWhat types?\u201d\u201cLion Heads.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The store owner cleared a space on his counter and said. \u201cCan I take a look?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Dong Xuebing opened his luggage bag and took out the best pair of 45 Lion Head. He wants to know how much this store will offer. If the prices were too low, he would go to another shop. \u201cHow much is this pair worth? It\u2019s a 45mm.\u201dThe two walnut customers were also looking at that pair. \u201cOh, that\u2019s rare.\u201dThe store owner took the pair and measured it with a slide caliper ruler. \u201cIt\u2019s really 45mm. It\u2019s a nice pair.\u201d The stall owner looked up and asked. \u201cYoung man, how much are you selling?\u201dDong Xuebing asked him back: \u201cHow much are you offering?\u201dThe store owner scrutinized the pair and replied. \u201cThis is almost a perfect pair. Hmmm\u2026\u2026 how about 9,000 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing felt this was a reasonable offer. But he did not agree immediately. He took out another pair of 44mm. \u201cHow about this pair?\u201d\u201cYou still have?\u201d The store owner was shocked.After measuring, the store owner replied: \u201cMy highest offer for this pair is 5,500 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing thought for a while and took out a pair of 43mm. \u201cWhat about this?\u201d\u201cOh, this size is also above average. Hmmm\u2026\u2026. 2,000 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing bent over and took out another pair. \u201cWhat about this pair?\u201dThe store owner was excited. \u201cHahaha, young man, just take out everything, and I will evaluate all their value.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d The store owner and the customers were surprised to see Dong Xuebing placed a lot of plastic bags on the counters.The customers were speechless. One of them asked. \u201cDamn, young man. Did you reserve a walnut tree? How come you have so many pairs?\u201dThe other customer said: \u201cReserving a tree is very expensive. It cost a few hundred thousand RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing smiled. These Lion Head were not bought at Lion Head prices. It was bought at Chicken Heart prices.The store owner starts to evaluate the Lion Heads. \u201cThis pair is 1,000 RMB\u2026\u2026 Hmmm\u2026.. This pair is not perfect despite it being bigger\u2026\u2026 500 RMB\u2026\u2026 This pair is smaller, I can only offer 400 RMB at most\u2026\u2026 This pair is even smaller\u2026\u2026 Even if it is perfectly matched, it is not worth much. I will not take this pair. Why not you ask some other stores if they are willing to take it?\u201dDong Xuebing replied. \u201cIt\u2019s fine even if you offer a lower price. I am lazy to look for another shop.\u201dThe store owner nodded. \u201cFine, I will offer 70 RMB for this pair and 100 RMB for that.\u201dAfter a while, the store owner tabulated the total amount. Other than 7 to 8 pairs which did not fetch good prices, the rest were still able to fetch high prices. The more expensive pairs were a few thousand, and the lower pairs were a few hundred. The store owner said. \u201cThe total is 69,500 RMB. Since you are selling so many pairs, I will round it up to 70,000 RMB. If you still have good pairs of walnuts, remember to come back to me.\u201d70,000 RMB?70,000 RMB?70,000 RMB!!!Dong Xuebing was stunned.So much?Why was the total so high?How come the total is so high?The store owner looked at Dong Xuebing and asked: \u201cYou want cash or\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCash!\u201d Dong Xuebing replied.\u201cOk. Wait for a while.\u201d The store owner called his staff. \u201cXiao Zhao take out 70,000 RMB from the safe!\u201dDong Xuebing took a deep breath. He knew he was not dreaming. 5 minutes later, he took the 70,000 RMB from the owner and packed it into his luggage bag. He was still in a daze when he walks back home.Dong Xuebing had only wanted to look for a pair of 46mm Lion Head for Liu Hua. This was so unexpected.

This was why he got a nickname of Iron to face Chief. The middle age man beside him was totally the opposite of him. He had a smile on his face and had the worst reputation in the Bureau.

But today, he could not focus. Every few minutes, his mind will wander and think about his wedding anniversary in a few more days. He and Tian Tian met at their university. It was love at first sight. They started dating in their 2nd year. But Tian Tian\u2019s father was an official in Beijing and had some authority. Liu Hua\u2019s parents were only workers at a food processing factory, and Tian Tian\u2019s parents object to them dating.After graduating, Liu Hua knew that it was hard for both of them to be together and decided to give up on this relationship.But Tian Tian went against her parent's wishes and fall out with them. She left with Liu Hua, and both of them rented a place outside. They lived and worked together. It was a small and old one-story house. Their salaries were barely enough for their rent and living expenses. Even their wedding rings were silver rings. To Liu Hua, it was the toughest period of his life, but it was also the happiest period. It was until Liu Hua entered the Government service and climbed up the ranks before Tian Tian\u2019s father accepted him. Tian Tian\u2019s father used his connection to help Liu Hua promote to where he is now.This was why Liu Hua kept feeling that he owed Tian Tian a lot. If it weren\u2019t for him, Tian Tian would not need to suffer for so many years.It will be their 10th wedding anniversary, and Liu Hua wanted to give his wife something to express his gratitude. Tian Tian does not have any hobbies except for collecting walnuts. She always wanted a pair of 46mm Lion Head and Liu Hua knew about it. He had searched all over the antique markets and internet forums. He thought it should be easy to buy a pair of walnuts if he was willing to pay above the market price. But this was not the case.\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not selling.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t have.\u201d \u201cNot selling.\u201d There were the answers Liu Hua got.Liu Hua was frustrated. He could not even fulfill Tian Tian\u2019s small wish.Bzzzz, bzzzz, bzzzz. Liu Hua\u2019s phone beside his PC monitor starts vibrating.Liu Hua looked at the number and immediately answered. \u201cBoss Zhao, have you found the walnut I am looking for? What? You still can\u2019t find it\u2026\u2026 I know 46mm Lion Head are rare, but\u2026\u2026 Ok. I don\u2019t care how much it cost, but I must get a pair\u2026\u2026 a few months? I don\u2019t have a few months\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Hua threw his phone on his desk and sighed. \u201cThere is no more time!\u201dKnock, knock. Someone was knocking on Liu Hua\u2019s office door.Liu Hua looked towards the door and said. \u201cCome in.\u201dThe door opened, and Dong Xuebing entered the room nervously. \u201cChief Liu.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Liu Hua frowned and massaged his forehead to calm himself.Liu Hua was in-charge of some unimportant departments in the bureau, and he seldom asks the General Affairs Office to do things. This was why Dong Xuebing had no excuses to visit his office. There were not even documents to be delivered to him. Dong Xuebing awkwardly coughed and took out a small box from his pocket. \u201cChief Liu, please accept this\u2026\u2026 Errr\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026. This is just a small gift.\u201dLiu Hua\u2019s face changed. \u201cDidn\u2019t I make things clear that day?\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with this Xiao Dong? Giving gifts again and again? He is too insensible!\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing smiled and quickly opened up the box. \u201cIt is not something valuable. It is just a pair of walnuts. Please take a look.\u201dLiu Hua was stunned when he saw the pair of yellowish walnuts in the box.Dong Xuebing continued: \u201cThis is a pair of Lion Head, and both are 46.8mm.\u201dWhat?46mm Lion Heads?!Liu Hua\u2019s heart was racing. This was unbelievable. The pair of Lion Heads he had been searching high and low had appeared in front of him. How come this Xiao Dong know that I am looking for this pair of Lion Head? Who told him this? Impossible! This is absolutely impossible! Even Tian Tian does not know I am looking for Lion Head! I had only written about this in my notebook! But that notebook is with me all the time. No one should know!Liu Hua stared at Dong Xuebing\u2019s eyes. He wants to know what Dong Xuebing was thinking.Dong Xuebing was nervous and said: \u201cI passed by the antique market and saw these. I don\u2019t know if you like it or not, but I bought it.Liu Hua kept quiet.Dong Xuebing knew Liu Hua was tempted, if not he would have chased him out of the room. He placed the box on the desk and said. \u201cChief Liu, I will go back first.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Liu Hua stopped him and paused for a few seconds. \u201cXiao Dong. I like your gift, but I cannot accept it. How about this? How much did you buy this pair of Lion Heads? I will pay for you.\u201d\u201cNo need. It\u2019s not worth anything.\u201dLiu Hua took out his bag. \u201cHow much?\u201dDong Xuebing can only reply: \u201cIt\u2019s only a few hundreds.\u201dLiu Hua knew the value of this pair of 46mm Lion Head, and he shook his head. He wanted to give Dong Xuebing 15,000 RMB, but he did not have so much cash with him. He only has about 5,000 RMB in his bag. He knitted his brows. Since he had already said that he will pay for it, he took out the 5,000 RMB in his bag and pass it to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing pretends to be surprised. \u201cAh\u2026.. This is too much.\u201dLiu Hua ignored him and said: \u201cTake it!\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 Ok. I will take it. This is taking advantage of you.\u201d Dong Xuebing accepted the money with politely.Liu Hua thought to himself. This young man knows how to say nice things.After Dong Xuebing left his office, Liu Hua smiles.Finally!I have finally found it!Liu Hua took out the two 46mm Lion Head and look at it. He kept it back into the box and immediately call his wife. \u201cHello? Tian Tian, I have made a reservation this weekend. Hahaha\u2026. I have a gift for you\u2026.. I will not tell you now\u2026\u2026. I promise it is a surprise!\u201dAfter hanging up, Liu Hua remembered the stories about this Dong Xuebing.Firefighter Xiao Dong?! The one who can save all situations?Liu Hua was speechless. Since when did such a person appear in the Western District Branch Bureau?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNext day. Tuesday.Today was the most important day for Dong Xuebing. The moment he woke up, he was feeling very nervous. He climbed out of his bed and took a few deep breaths. He had done everything he could. There\u2019s no point being nervous now. Dong Xuebing stopped himself from thinking about the outcome of the Party Committee Meeting. He slapped himself lightly on his forehead to calm himself down before preparing himself for work.At the entrance of the Western District Branch Bureau, Dong Xuebing saw Guo Shunjie and a woman.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to look for me at my workplace? What do you want?\u201d\u201cYou think I am willing to come here? You forgot your phone!\u201d\u201cOk, ok! Hurry up and leave!\u201dGuo Shunjie grabbed his phone from that woman impatiently and kept it in his pocket. He then waved the woman away. This woman was Guo Shunjie\u2019s wife. She was 30 years\u2019 old when she got Vitiligo. Her face and neck have patches of white skin. This was why Guo Shunjie had never mentioned his wife at work. He was also afraid of his wife coming to his workplace. He felt it was embarrassing. But when Guo Shunjie looks around to see if any of his co-workers had seen his wife, he spotted Dong Xuebing crossing the road and walk past him.Guo Shunjie pulled a long face and said. \u201cYou are early today!\u201d\u201cNot as early as you!\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s hatred for him deepens after seeing how Guo Shunjie treated his wife.\u201cDo you know? The Party Committee Meeting today will be discussing who will be promoted to be the Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Department.\u201d Guo Shunjie stared at Dong Xuebing coldly. \u201cYoung man, I have told you before that I will be a leader within one year. I had offered to groom you as my trusted aide. But you are the one who rejected my kind offer. Are you regretting now? It\u2019s too late! Once the order is passed down, you will be dead! I will make sure you will regret it!\u201dDong Xuebing glanced at him. \u201cYou are so sure that you will be promoted?\u201dGuo Shunjie arrogantly replied: \u201cHaha, you think Guo Panwei will win me? Dream on!\u201dDong Xuebing clenched his fist. He must not let Guo Shunjie be promoted. If not, he will not be able to carry on working here.General Affairs Office. People start arriving at work.Dong Xuebing could feel the mood in the office was different. He could feel the tension.There seems to be something happening. Guo Panwei entered the office, and he was obviously in a bad mood. He did not argue with Guo Shunjie like the previous few days. He just dropped his briefcase at his desk and went upstairs, to the Political Section Chief Pang Bin\u2019s office. Guo Shunjie took a glance at him confidently and then left for Political Commissar Zhou Guoan\u2019s office.Political Commissar office.This office was dim. The thick curtains had blocked the sunlight from entering the room.Guo Shunjie stood cautiously by the side: \u201cUncle Zhou, later during the meeting\u2026\u2026\u201dThe scheming looking Zhou Guoan narrowed his eyes and interrupted him. \u201cShunjie, I have promised your father I will try my best to help you. Don\u2019t worry. There will not be any problems. You should go back to work, and during this period, you should not be coming to my office. Do you understand?\u201d Government officials seldom claim that things will surely be done. They will always keep a leeway for themselves. Since Political Commissar Zhou said there will not be any problems, then it means he was 100% confident of completing this task.After hearing this, Guo Shunjie felt assured and thanked him excitedly. \u201cThank you. Uncle Zhou. I will give you a thank you gift after this matter is over.\u201dZhou Guoan did not like the way Guo Shunjie put his words. It was too direct. He frowned and wave him off.After leaving the office, Guo Shunjie was feeling great. He walks back with his back straight and chests out.The other side of the building.Dong Xuebing had received a call from Xu Yan, asking him to go to her office.There was another man in Deputy Branch Bureau Chief Xu Yan\u2019s office. That man was about Xu Yan\u2019s age and had big eyes. There were a few streaks of white hair by his sides, and he looks very alert.Dong Xuebing had seen this man before. He was the Branch Bureau\u2019s Party Committee Member, Commission for Discipline Inspection Secretary Song Shoujie. He was close to Xu Yan.\u201cChief Xu, Secretary Song.\u201dXu Yan acknowledged and pass a document to Dong Xuebing. \u201cMake a copy of this document and send the original copy to the filing room.\u201dSong Shoujie was observing Dong Xuebing quietly.Dong Xuebing took the document. \u201cYes. Is there anything else?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all. Go back to work.\u201dAfter Dong Xuebing left the office, Song Shoujie laughed and shook his head. \u201cThat is the Xiao Dong you are talking about? You really want to push up him to take over the position of Deputy Chief of General Affairs Office? You should know that Political Commissar Zhou has a candidate in mind, and it is almost decided internally. It will be hard to change.\u201dXu Yan smoothed her hair: \u201cI don\u2019t expect to win Political Commissar Zhou, but I just want to try.\u201dSong Shoujie smiles. \u201cFine. What I can do is only to say a few good words. But I still must ask you. This person you pick seems to be a bit\u2026\u2026 too ordinary. He is very young, inexperienced, and did not seem to be able to lead. I wonder what you are thinking?\u201dXu Yan slowly took a sip of tea and smiled. \u201cOld Song, you cannot judge Xiao Dong based on his appearance.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Song Shoujie said. \u201cTell me about it.\u201dXu Yan spoke slowly. \u201cYou should have heard what Xiao Dong did after he joined the General Affairs Office. Haha\u2026\u2026 You are an athlete when you are young, and you are also someone with guts. But Old Song, both of us have seen the raging fire in Li Qing\u2019s office. If you are your younger self that day, do you dare to run into the office to retrieve the documents?\u201dSong Shoujie kept quiet.Xu Yan continued: \u201cBut Xiao Dong dares, and he was able to retrieve the documents.\u201dSong Shoujie nodded.\u201cYou should have heard about the football matches a few days ago. Our goalkeeper is injured during the injury time, and our opponents have a penalty. In that situation, who dares to claim that he is confident of saving that penalty kick?\u201d Xu Yan put down her teacup. \u201cBut Xiao Dong dares to claim that he will save the penalty kick and he really saves it.\u201d After pausing a while, Xu Yan continued. \u201cThe next game on the next day was a tough match. In the final 2 minutes, one of our players got injured, but there are no more substitutes. Our branch will be playing 8 games without a single win. At that moment, not even those English Premier League star players could do anything. But Xiao Dong went onto the pitch and scored the winning goal in the last second!\u201dSong Shoujie laughed. \u201cFrom what you said\u2026\u2026 This Xiao Dong is really capable.\u201d\u201cHe is even more amazing than that.\u201d Xu Yan tapped the tabletop with her fingertips. \u201cThat day, I went to the City Bureau for a meeting, and I met an old friend. We had a short chat, and we talked about the football tournament. But when I mentioned Xiao Dong\u2019s name, my friend also knows him. She is one of the interviewers for Xiao Dong, and she told me what happened during the interview. It was an incredible story.\u201dSong Shoujie asked curiously. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dXu Yan stopped for a while and then opened the door of the office. There were sounds of footsteps outside, and a staff member walked pass the office carrying some documents. After the staff member walked pass, Xu Yan closed the door and looked at the puzzled Song Shoujie. \u201cOld Song, the person who walked pass just now. Can you remember what color his shirt is? What design is that shirt, and what is the design and color of his shoes?\u201dSong Shoujie was stunned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cNothing. I just want to see if you can remember those details.\u201d\u201cYan Zhi, are you joking with me? You did not even tell me to take note of those details, and my attention just now is also not on that person.\u201dXu Yan returned to her seat. \u201cThis is why I say Xiao Dong is amazing. During his interview, the main interviewer tried to make things difficult for him, and purposely asked him the same questions I asked you. But guess what? 3 people walked pass on that day. Xiao Dong not only remembered the colors of their shirts and designs. He even remembered the pattern of the designs, necklace, whether if the shoes had dirt and even the color of the shoelaces.\u201dSong Shoujie frowned. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201dXu Yan smiled. \u201cI also feel that it is impossible, but it was the truth. Xiao Dong really did it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a period of silence in the room.Xu Yan looked at Song Shoujie. \u201cNow, do you still think Xiao Dong is ordinary? I think he is too amazing!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was only the sound of the photocopier machine in the General Affairs Office. No one speaks a single word. Tan Limei kept looking at the clock, and she turned to Dong Xuebing and Zhuang Zhi. She waved her watch. It was 10 am. Tan Limei then looked at Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie. Dong Xuebing\u2019s heart was beating fast.Let fate decide!5th story, No.1 meeting room. The Branch Party Committee meeting starts.The morning rays shine through the windows of the meeting room, and there were a few vases of flowers in the room.The 10 committee members all arrived at the meeting room. Branch Bureau Chief Yan Liang was seated at the head of the table. The rest of the members were sitting by his sides accordingly. Political Commissar Zhou Guoan, Deputy Political Commissar Li Mingyu, Deputy Political Commissar Cheng Haimei, Deputy Branch Bureau Chief and Director of the General Affairs Department Xu Yan, Political Section Chief Pang Bin, Deputy Branch Bureau Chief Zhao Jinxi, Commission for Discipline Inspection Secretary Song Shoujie, Deputy Branch Bureau Liu Hua and Deputy Branch Bureau Yang Yizhong. This ranking was according to the importance of their positions. It was not according to their seniority. For instance, Deputy Political Commissar Li Mingyu and Deputy Political Commissar Cheng Haimei were ranked above Political Section Chief Pang Bin due to their experience and length of service. But in terms of authority, Chief Pang had more influence.After all the members were seated, Yan Liang cleared his throat.Xiao Lu, who was in charge of taking the meeting minutes, closed the heavy doors and sat in a corner with a pen and paper.\u201cThere is a lot of things on today\u2019s agenda. First\u2026\u2026\u201d Yan Liang was unlike the other leaders where they will start talking about how great the party or the policies were. He was not someone who likes to waste time. He was a direct and straight forward person. \u201cNot too long ago, the demolition of the Youanmeng area had cleared the rows of houses in front of our branch. The feedback from the ground is that our Bureau has become too open, and it is not suitable for our intelligence officers to enter. What do you all think?\u201dYang Yizhong was the first to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to shift to a new place. These buildings are already decades old.\u201d\u201cWhere can we move to?\u201d Deputy Political Commissar Li Mingyu asked. \u201cIt will take a long time before we can find a suitable location. The layout of the new building is also another problem. It is not so easy to shift to a new place. You also need to look at the security issues. I think we should report this to the City Bureau and see if they could do anything to the area in front of our branch. It would be best if we do not need to shift.\u201dThe members start to discuss this issue.Yan Liang did not say anything. He listened to the discussion for a while before looking at Xu Yan. \u201cChief Xu, this is under your jurisdiction. What do you think?\u201dXu Yan smiled and look up. \u201cChief Yang is right. Our current branch buildings are too old and worn out. Repairs are needed everywhere. If we can use this opportunity to move to a new building, I will surely agree. But the crucial factor is the funds. Our branch\u2019s budget is tight, and this is\u2026\u2026\u201dYan Liang lifted his hand to stop Xu Yan. \u201cThis is an important issue. We will find ways to raise funds. You don\u2019t need to worry about the money. We should focus on whether if we should move to a new location.\u201d Yan Liang paused for a while and continued. \u201cThose that are in favor of shifting raise your hand.\u201d Yan Liang raised his hand, and the rest of the committee members also raise their hands except for Deputy Political Commissar Li Mingyu and Commission for Discipline Inspection Secretary Song Shoujie. They oppose this suggestion. Oh, Liu Hua gave an abstention vote. He was looking down all this while and did not utter a word.So, this subject was approved.Yan Liang continued: \u201cNext\u2026\u2026\u201dActually, the Party Committee should have an odd number of members to prevent a situation where there was an equal number of votes on both sides. But in the Western District Branch Bureau, there was this Deputy Chief Liu Hua. The one who will give up his vote on every single issue\u2026\u2026 The rest of the members were used to this. All of them treated this committee to have 9 members. This was also the reason why after Yang Yizhong was transferred over, the committee did not report to the higher-ups to increase the number of members.The next issue did not need to vote. After some discussions, almost every member was on the same page and have the same opinions.The next issue, 5 voted agree, 4 oppose and 1 abstention vote.The next issue, 9 voted agree and 1 abstention vote.The next issue, 7 voted agree, 2 oppose and 1 abstention vote.Most of the leaders of committees do not like to use votes to decide. It will make the leader look like he could not control his people. But Yan Liang leadership style was different. He is a fair person and likes being fair to others. This was why as long as one member disagrees with the rest of the members, he will ask the members to vote to decide on how the issue should be handled.\u201cNext is a personnel issue. Chief Pang.\u201d Yan Laing and the rest of the members flipped to the last page of the documents in front of them.Pang Bin is short and fat. When he heard Chief Yan calling him, he immediately said. \u201cSome time ago, General Affairs Office\u2019s Deputy Chief Zhou Changchun early retired due to his health, and after some observations, we have listed 3 nominees to replace him. General Affairs Office Guo Panwei, General Affairs Office Guo Shunjie and General Affairs Office Dong Xuebing.\u201dYan Liang nodded. \u201cThe information of the 3 candidates is in front of you. Let\u2019s discuss.\u201dPersonnel appointment is a sensitive issue. This is because there are many office politics factors in it, and most of the fighting is because of this. All the members read the documents carefully. Actually, all of them had read the documents before the meeting.\u201cI shall start first.\u201d Pang Bin sat up straight, and his big belly was pressing against the meeting table. \u201cThe Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office is an important role. Most of the documents and other matters have to pass through there. So, I feel that this Deputy Chief must be someone experience. Guo Panwei has been in General Affairs Office for 7 to 8 years. He is more senior than Guo Shunjie and Dong Xuebing. He is also hardworking and experienced. I believe he can lead the General Affairs Office to the next level.\u201dYan Liang nodded but did not express any opinions.After Pang Bin finished, he took a glanced at Deputy Political Commissar Cheng Haimei. She knew Pang Bin was waiting for her to speak up and support his suggestion. But Cheng Haimei pretended not to see it, and she stared at the spotless tabletop in front of her.Pang Binn frowned. This bitch had promised she will support his candidate a few days ago. But these few days, her attitude had changed. Pang Bin knew Cheng Haimei had changed her mind and was bought over by Deputy Political Commissar Zhou. Did she change her stance to let her nephew get a transfer?Pang Bin could tell Deputy Political Commissar Zhou was determined to let his people get this position.It seems that even with Chief Yan\u2019s support, Guo Panwei\u2019s votes will not be enough!Zhou Guoan was sitting there confidently drinking his tea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPang Bin\u2019s suggestion was not supported by anyone, and the meeting room fell into silence again.The next person that spoke was Deputy Branch Bureau Chief Zhao Jinxi. He was a loyal follower of Political Commissar Zhou. He will do whatever Political Commissar Zhou ask him to do. \u201cChief Pang mentioned that we must look at the experience of the candidates. I totally agree with him. But Chief Pang seems to forget that Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei had entered the bureau at around the same time. The difference between them is not more than 6 months. How can Guo Panwei be more experience than Guo Shunjie? What logic is this?\u201dPang Bin looked at him. \u201cWhat the experience I am talking about is not only the length of service. I also look at his contributions to the bureau!\u201dZhao Jinxi had a smile on his old wrinkled face. \u201cGuo Shunjie had also devoted all his heart into his work and made many contributions to our bureau. I personally felt the matured Guo Shunjie is more suitable to be the Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office. Don\u2019t you think Guo Panwei is a bit\u2026\u2026 frivolous? How can such a person be the Deputy Chief? This is being irresponsible to the people in the General Affairs Office!\u201dPang Bin was furious. \u201cFrivolous? How can you use such degrading term on our comrades? Deputy Chief Zhao, please watch your words. Guo Panwei is capable of dealing with everyone. This type of people is most suitable to work in the General Affairs Office!\u201d Pang Bin was furious. He did not even address Zhao Jinxi as Chief Zhao. He purposely added the word \u201cDeputy\u201d in front.Zhao Jinxi and Pang Bin started quarreling.Yan Liang knocked on the table and shouted: \u201cStop! This is a meeting!\u201dZhou Guoan secretly glanced at Cheng Haimei\u2019s direction.Cheng Haimei did not say much. She only said: \u201cI support Guo Shunjie.\u201dPang Bin had a terrible look on his face. The should be the final outcome. There\u2019s no point arguing anymore. He lowered his head and poured water into his cup.\u201cI also support Guo Shunjie.\u201d Deputy Political Commissar Li Mingyu, in his fifties, was closer to Political Commissar Zhou faction. He saw Yan Liang did not show any support or objections, he knew what Yan Liang was thinking. He continued: \u201cI am not looking down on Guo Panwei. But I feel Guo Shunjie is more suitable for this role. The ages of most staff members in the General Affairs Office are young, and there are many new faces. That\u2019s why the General Affairs Office need someone mature like Guo Shunjie to lead them!\u201dAfter hearing this, Xu Yan felt uncomfortable. Who are you to meddle with my General Affairs Department? If it\u2019s the Political Commissar or Political Section Chief, I can still understand. But you are not respecting me now and stepping out of your place!Yan Liang still had an indifferent attitude. He could tell Political Commissar Zhou had planned all these and this should be the final outcome. It\u2019s time to end this topic and move on. They were short on time.But at this moment, Xu Yan spoke. She placed her teacup on the table loudly. \u201cThe General Affairs Office is under my jurisdiction. I think I am the most suitable person to talk about the candidates.\u201d She then narrowed her eyes and looked at Li Mingyu and Zhao Jinxi. \u201cI know Guo Panwei and Guo Shunjie better than anyone else here. Both of them are good in many ways, but they lack something. What do they lack? It\u2019s not experience or attitude! It\u2019s a drive!\u201dLi Mingyu was stunned and did not understand what Xu Yan was talking about.Xu Yan then said something shocking. \u201cI proposed Dong Xuebing! The reason is simple! This young man has the drive and is full of vigor!\u201dZhao Jinxi laughed. \u201cDong Xuebing? How long has he been with the bureau? One month or two months? He is too junior! How can he be the Deputy Chief?\u201dXu Yan replied emotionlessly. \u201cI would like to say that experiences are not about the length of service. What we want is results and contributions to our branch bureau. Do you remember the fire in Director Li\u2019s office? Xiao Dong is the one who ran in to retrieve the documents. I am sure all of you have heard of this incident. Chief Yan had also granted exceptional approval for Xiao Dong to enter the Party. All of you should also know about this. During the football tournament a few days ago, Xiao Dong was the one who helps our branch avoid losing all matches. I am sure all of you are aware of this. If all these are not contributions, what are contributions?\u201dYan Liang frowned. He also did not expect Xu Yan to try to push this young man up.Commission for Discipline Inspection Secretary Song Shoujie cleared his throat. \u201cI agree with Chief Xu. Although Xiao Dong is new to our branch, all of us can see what he had done for the bureau. Many department heads and colleagues acknowledge Xiao Dong. This is very rare.\u201dLi Mingyu shook his head. \u201cHe is too young. He is only 23 years\u2019 old, and he did not even pass his one-year probation!\u201dZhao Jinxi thought nothing about this and laughed. \u201cI know about soccer matches. But that\u2019s only a friendly game organized by the City Bureau. What has it got to do with our Western District branch bureau\u2019s work? You cannot use this to judge him. We are choosing the Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office and not an athlete!\u201dXu Yan looked at him. \u201cWhat I am emphasizing is not Dong Xuebing\u2019s football skills. It is his attitude in times of need. He dares to step up in difficult situations! This is an important aspect for leaders! I cannot accept Guo Shunjie\u2019s attitude during the matches. He hides behind everyone when there are difficulties. How can someone with such attitude be suitable to lead the General Affairs Office?\u201dZhao Jinxi said. \u201cChief Xu, I think you have misunderstood Guo Shunjie. I am confident Xiao Guo is not what you said.\u201dYang Yizhong suddenly speaks. He was a straight forward person, and his words were direct. \u201cI also do not like that Guo Shunjie. He is too\u2026\u2026\u201d Yang Yizhong was searching for the right word to describe. His education level is low, and he thought for a few seconds before he got the word. \u201c\u2026\u2026 impetuous.\u201d He then continued: \u201cDong Xuebing is good. Smart and dependable!\u201dXu Yan and Song Shoujie exchanged looks. They were surprised that his newly transferred Yang Yizhong chose to join her faction. Actually, Yang Yizhong was the sort of person that do not take sides. He looked at the problems objectively and was considered a free person in the Party Committee. He will just speak his mind and did not consider joining any faction.Political Commissar Zhou who had been keeping silent all this while could feel the tension. He frowned as he never expects the candidate Dong Xuebing, he looks down upon had gotten 3 votes supporting him!But Political Commissar Zhou remained expressionless. It\u2019s only 3 votes. Even if he got 4 votes, he still does not stand a chance.This personnel appointment had already decided during a previous conversation between Zhou Guoan and Yan Liang.No matter what was discussed during the meeting, Yan Liang will surely support Guo Shunjie!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was still considered a secret now. But the Political Commissar Zhou has connections in the City Bureau, and he should have heard about it. Political Commissar Zhou went to look for Yan Liang. Both of them had some minor conflicts over the years, but it was nothing major. Both were still considered to be on good terms. Yan Liang will be transferred out soon, and his attitude had changed. He felt he should let some of his authority go and sell Zhou Guoan favor. If Zhou Guoan were able to succeed his position, Zhou Guoan would also treat his former close subordinates well.Yes.Yan Liang had decided to support Guo Shunjie to be the Deputy Chief of General Affairs Office. Zhou Guoan\u2019s side had got 4 votes. With Yan Liang\u2019s vote, it will be 5 votes. Xu Yan only has 3 votes. She needs 3 more people to support her. But Pang Bin had expressed his support and Liu Hua will give up his vote. There were no more people.5:3This will be the final outcome.\u201cXiao Dong do have the capabilities.\u201d Yan Liang did not say much. But his tone was very obvious. \u201cBut his age?\u201d If this were mentioned by someone else, Xu Yan and Song Shoujie would surely retort. But it was Chief Yan who suggested. It was different. Xu Yan could feel Yan Liang\u2019s attitude. She sighed in her heart. She knew there was nothing she could do. The No.1 and No.2 of the branch had decided to support Guo Shunjie. There was no way Guo Shunjie would not get this position.Zhou Guoan added. \u201cState Security is a special department in our country, and the General Affairs Office handles the documents of a lot of departments. For a two-month-old newbie, we must take time to monitor and observe him. I am sure no one here wants any accidents to happen in the future.\u201dXu Yan\u2019s face changed. \u201cThese words are too serious.\u201dZhou Guoan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\u201dSong Shoujie frowned. \u201cXiao Dong\u2019s background checks were already concluded. If not, he will also not enter the State Security. This should not be mentioned now\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing.\u201d Yan Liang massaged his temples. \u201cSince Guo Shunjie and Dong Xuebing are the top candidates, then we shall vote. Those that support Guo Shunjie raise your hands.\u201d Yan Liang did not raise his hand immediately. When there were different views, he will usually wait until after everyone have expressed their views.Yan Liang was a righteous person. But being righteous was only his weapon for power. Struggling for power\u2026\u2026 was the primary motive for being in politics!Yan Liang had high political wisdom. If not, he would not climb to the position of branch bureau Chief.\u201cI support Guo Shunjie.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201dZhou Guoan, Li Mingyu, Zhao Jingxi, Cheng Haimei raised their hands. 4 votes!Yan Liang nodded. \u201cThose that support Dong Xuebing raise your hands.\u201dXu Yan was the first to raise her hand, followed by Song Shoujie and Yang Yizhong. 3 votes!Zhao Jingxi smiled, and side glanced to his side. But this gesture made Pang Bin furious again. Chief Pang still remembers Zhao Jingxi\u2019s sarcastic remarks earlier, and he wants to stir up the problem for him. Pang Bin loudly said. \u201cSince Guo Panwei does not have any chance, then I think Dong Xuebing is a better candidate than Guo Shunjie.\u201d He finished speaking and raise his hand!4 votes!Zhou Guoan sneered.Zhao Jingxi knew from Zhou Guoan that Chief Yan will support them. He smiled at Pang Bin.Pang Bin also knew from Yan Liang\u2019s tone that nothing will change even if he supported Dong Xuebing. But he still raises his hand. His purpose was only to add some obstacles to Zhao Jingxi.Zhao Jingxi\u2019s sarcastic remarks and Cheng Haimei\u2019s last minute change of mind had pissed Pang Bin off.Xu Yan and Song Shoujie looked at each other and smile warily. They knew this was decided. But they were still surprised to see they had gotten 4 votes. It was the same number of votes as Zhou Guoan\u2019s side. This was still a good sign. If Dong Xuebing was slightly older and had a longer length of service, the results will be different. Chief Yan might also\u2026\u2026\u201cI support Dong Xuebing!\u201dWhen everyone was waiting for Yan Liang to announce Guo Shunjie\u2019s promotion, they heard someone saying this. Everyone was shocked!1 second\u2026\u2026.2 seconds\u2026\u2026The time seems to have stopped!Zhao Jingxi looked at the person sitting beside him in shock. This was someone who never says anything during their meeting. He still thought he had misheard. \u201cWhat?\u201dYan Laing, Zhou Guoan, Xu Yan, Song Shoujie, Cheng Haimei, Li Mingyu and the rest all turned to look at that person. All of them had different facial expressions.This person had come to the Western District for more than a year. He had never expressed his views during their Party Committee meetings before. All this while, he has been keeping quiet in a corner from the start until the end of the meetings. Liu Hua, who have always give up his vote, had voted for the very first time in their sessions! Liu Hua raised his hand and did not give any reason. He only repeated what he said calmly: \u201cI support Dong Xuebing.\u201d5 votes!No one expected Liu Hua to say anything, but at this very moment, he opened his mouth!This was surprising!!!!At this moment, Xu Yan could feel goosebumps. She stared at Liu Hua in shock before turning to look at Yan Liang!Zhou Guoan\u2019s face was black. Very black. He also turned to look at Yan Liang!Song Shoujie swallowed his saliva and turned to look at Chief Yan!Soon, everyone was looking at Yan Liang. They want to know who will Yan Liang support!?Yan Liang took a deep breath. He had wanted to vote for Guo Shunjie. Yes. That was what he had decided. Firstly, Dong Xuebing was too young, and he still prefers Guo Shunjie, who was older. Secondly, he wanted to sell Zhou Guoan favor. They had already discussed this before the meeting. But now, Yan Liang suddenly realized that\u2026\u2026 he cannot vote for Gou Shunjie!Yes. Yan Liang cannot vote for him!It was 5:4 now. Even if Yan Liang vote for Guo Shunjie, it will still be 5:5. A draw!The No.1 and No.2 of a branch bureau voted for the same person, and the result was a draw, it will be a laughing stock if words get out! This Leaders in the City Bureau will think there are some problems with the leadership in the Western District branch!If Yan Liang had voted for Guo Shunjie at the first moment, Pang Bin will surely not dare to vote for Dong Xuebing!If Yan Liang had openly voiced out his support for Guo Shunjie, then they will not need to vote!If\u2026\u2026But\u2026\u2026 there are no so many ifs!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was the official lunchtime for the General Affairs Office.But no one from the office went out for lunch. Guo Panwei was staring at the ceiling in a daze. Guo Shunjie was smiling confidently. Changjuan and Tan Limei were looking at each other. Zhuang Zhi was typing some reports, but he kept stealing glances at Guo Shunjie\u2019s direction. Even Old Yan stopped reading his newspaper and kept looking at the corridor. Based on previous experiences, after the Committee Meeting, Xiao Lu, who was taking the meeting minutes, will pass by the hallway.1 minute\u2026\u20265 minutes\u2026\u2026There was still no one.Tan Limei\u2019s stomach was growling, and she blushed. \u201cZhuang Zhi, Bing Zhi, let\u2019s go for lunch?\u201dDong Xuebing was very nervous and did not have the mood for lunch. \u201cLet\u2019s wait a while longer.\u201dZhuang Zhi scratched his head. \u201cErrrrrr\u2026\u2026 I will also wait for a while.\u201dGuo Shunjie sneered at them. He speaks to himself in his heart. You all still don\u2019t know the situation? It\u2019s evident that other than me, who else will be the Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office? Even Guo Panwei had given up the fight. But despite knowing the final result, Guo Shunjie also did not go out for lunch. He wants to hear the news from Xiao Lu straight and look at the expressions of the others!Shock? Jealous? Hatred?Guo Shunjie was waiting for this beautiful moment. He had nothing to do now and starts to think of ways to reorganize the General Affairs Office. Yes. Dong Xuebing must be dealt with first. But Director Li Qing was close to him, and I cannot make it too visible. I must think of a way. Right. I will let Dong Xuebing take care of the office\u2019s cleanliness from now on. He will still have to change the water and carry things. That will be his job today! Guo Panwei will be the second person. Hmph! Dare to vie with me for the position of Deputy Chief? Xiao Tan have been hardworking. I will let her off. Changjuan knew the situation and had been respectful to me recently. I will also let her off. As for Sun Zhuang and Old Yan\u2026\u2026 Depends on my mood!At the other side of the office.Changjuan dragged Tan Limei, Dong Xuebing, and Zhuangzhi to one corner.Tan Limei was hugging her stomach and whispered: \u201cHow come the meeting have not to end? If I wait any longer, I will faint from hunger.\u201d\u201cI think it should be ending soon.\u201d Changjuan laughed. \u201cIt should be another 10 minutes at most. Let\u2019s wait a while more and then go for lunch together.\u201dZhuang Zhi nervously asked. \u201cSister Chang, who do you think will be our new Deputy Chief? Is it that Guo Shunjie? Does Guo Panwei have any chance?\u201d Zhuang Zhi also dislikes these two people. But comparing both, he still hopes for Guo Panwei to be promoted.Changjuan rolled her eyes. \u201cI have told you all previously that Guo Shunjie will definitely be our new Deputy Chief. Why are you still asking?\u201dZhuang Zhi smiled embarrassedly.Dong Xuebing kept quiet and was playing with his fingers.Changjuan could tell Dong Xuebing was very nervous, and she sighed. \u201cXiao Dong. You might not like what I said. But in government service, you must be humble and respect thee, leaders. Listen to me. If you need to bow down to others, just bow down. If not, you will do harm to yourself\u2026\u2026. Sighed\u2026\u2026 This is my advice to you. You decide for yourself.\u201dZhuang Zhi patted Dong Xuebing on his arm. \u201cBing Zhi\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing shook his head. Bow down? Bow down to Guo Shunjie? Over my dead body!Old Yan also walked over and said softly. \u201cThis office will not have peace in the future.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Tan Limei looked over at Guo Shunjie\u2019s direction.Ta\u2026\u2026 Ta\u2026\u2026. Ta\u2026\u2026 It was the sounds of footsteps. Everyone looks out at the corridor. It was Xiao Lu!Dong Xuebing\u2019s heart was racing.\u201cEh, Brother Lu, Brother Lu! Wait for a while.\u201d Changjuan was slightly older than Xiao Lu. But this Xiao Lu was Branch Bureau Chief Yan\u2019s favorite.This was why she address him as Brother Lu. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dXiao Lu stopped outside the office and walked into the office, smiling with a stack of documents.Guo Shunjie smiled and walk over to him.Xiao Lu smiled back at him but did not speak to him. He looked around the office looking for someone.Guo Shunjie had thought that Xiao Lu would speak to him first and then shake his hand to congratulate him for his promotion. But Xiao Lu\u2019s reaction\u2026\u2026 Guo Shunjie\u2019s smile froze! This\u2026\u2026 this\u2026\u2026 I am not the Deputy Chief?! How can this be?!Changjuan, Tan Limei, and the rest were shocked.

Xu Yan only said two words: \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Dong Xuebing sat down on his chair and closes his eyes.

All the office chiefs and staff members were surprised by this news. Xiao Dong was only 23 years old and had just joined the bureau recently. How come he was promoted so fast? Those with insider information were shocked. Dong Xuebing managed to get Deputy Bureau Chief Liu Hua to speak up for him? Liu Hua had been keeping quiet for almost two years! Dong Xuebing even beat the candidate chosen by Political Commissar Zhou? This was too\u2026\u2026Political Commissar office.Guo Shunjie asked angrily: \u201cUncle Zhou, what happened? Didn\u2019t you tell me that everything will be alright?\u201dZhou Guoan was also furious. He pulled a long face and said: \u201cYou still dare to ask me? What did I tell you on that day when your parents are around? Have more contacts with Chief Yang! Even if you cannot get his vote, you must not let him vote for others! But what did you do? Not only Yang Yizhong and Chief Xu strongly object to you being promoted, even Liu Hua\u2026\u2026 You tell me now! Tell me when did you offend them? Why didn\u2019t you tell me beforehand?\u201dGuo Shunjie immediately replied: \u201cUncle Zhou, I swear I did not offend any of them, especially that Liu Hua. I did not even speak to him before.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhou Guoan banged the table. \u201cIf you did not offend them, then it's Dong Xuebing who got their votes by himself? He has just entered the bureau for less than two months! How is it possible he gets their votes?!\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026\u2026 I really did not offend them!\u201dAt the same time, the Political Section Chief Office.Guo Panwei looked at Pang Bin blankly. \u201cChief Pang, how come it\u2019s Dong Xuebing that got promoted?\u201dPang Bin was also clueless. He also did not know what happened. \u201cPanwei, where did this Xiao Dong come from? How come Chief Xu supported him? Also, is his relationship with Chief Yang and Chief Liu close? Have you seen them speaking to each other in private?\u201dGuo Panwei replied with a sullen face. \u201cI only know that Dong Xuebing is close to Director Li Qing. Chief Xu, Chief Liu, and\u2026\u2026 Oh, during the soccer matches, Dong Xuebing had helped the team to win the match. Chief Xu was overjoyed because of this. Could this be the reason? Oh, Dong Xuebing was in-charge of writing Chief Yang\u2019s speeches. This might be the reason. But\u2026\u2026 Chief Liu? Eh? Chief Liu supported Dong Xuebing?\u201dAt the other side of the Western District Branch Bureau.A man in his 40s said: \u201cChief Xiao Dong, congrats.\u201dXiao Gao from the Political Affairs Section: \u201cChief Dong, you are promoted. Shouldn\u2019t you give us a treat?\u201dPublic Security Sixth Bureau\u2019s Xiao Wang: \u201cChief Dong, I am here to congratulate you.\u201dThese were all colleagues Dong Xuebing knew from the soccer match. Although Dong Xuebing was overjoyed, he did not let it get to his head. During this time, he must keep a low profile and be humble. His reply to them was that the official orders were not out yet and asked them to stop addressing him as Chief Dong.After lunch, when Dong Xuebing was about to return to his office, he received a call from Li Qing.Dong Xuebing immediately ran upstairs to Li Qing\u2019s office. The moment he entered the office, he heard Li Qing laughing loudly: \u201cGood job! You are good!\u201dIt\u2019s important to be humble and keep a low profile among colleagues, but in front of leaders, Dong Xuebing cannot behave this way. He must not let the leader feel that he was pretending. Dong Xuebing gratefully replied. \u201cThank you, Director Li. If it wasn\u2019t for your nomination, my name will also not appear in the Party Committee Meeting, and I will not get the opportunity to be the Deputy Chief.\u201dLi Qing was satisfied with Dong Xuebing\u2019s attitude. He laughed: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me. To be honest, I am not the one who helps you get this position. Even Chief Xu and Secretary Song did not expect you to be promoted. You are fortunate. Chief Yang, Chief Pang, and even Chief Liu voted for you.\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned.\u201cChief Pang? Shouldn\u2019t he be supporting Guo Pangwei?\u201dLi Qing smiled and told Dong Xuebing about what happened during the meeting. He had heard the whole process.Dong Xuebing was sweating after he heard what happened during the meeting. It was a close shave. He was relieved that he had played his moves right. The speeches for Yang Yizhong, winning the soccer match for Xu Yan, giving Liu Hua the pair of Lion Heads. If he did not do all these\u2026\u2026 He will never get the position of Deputy Chief!After leaving Li Qing\u2019s office, Dong Xuebing went straight to Xu Yan\u2019s office.On the way to Xu Yan\u2019s office, Dong Xuebing suddenly remembered that he should thank Xu Yan immediately after he got the news of his promotion. He should not go for lunch first. Damn. He had forgotten all about it!Xu Yan and Song Shoujie were in the office.Dong Xuebing was worried that Xu Yan would be unhappy with him. He immediately thanked her and Song Shoujie before they could even open their mouth.Song Shoujie laughed and asked. \u201cXiao Dong, are you close with Chief Yang and Chief Liu?\u201dDong Xuebing knew that Song Shoujie wanted to know how close he was to the two other Deputy Bureau Chiefs. He immediately acts innocent and replied: \u201cI have only written a few speeches for Chief Yang\u2026\u2026. We are not that close. I am not sure why Chief Yang and Chief Liu voted for me. Could it be that Chief Liu does not like Guo Shunjie?\u201dSong Shoujie nodded.Xu Yan looked at Dong Xuebing and smiled. It was rare to see her smile. \u201cCherish this opportunity well. I have been with the Bureau for many years, and this is the first time I see someone less than 2 months getting promoted.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately said. \u201cIt\u2019s all because of Chief Xu and Secretary Song\u2019s support.\u201dXu Yan asked: \u201cYou are 23 this year? Your age and experience are lower than 95% of the people in our branch. There will surely be people talking about you behind your back. You must keep a low profile these few days\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu Yan gave some advice to Dong Xuebing and then asked him to return to work. \u201cOk. Go back to work now.\u201d\u201cThank you for your advice.\u201dAfter leaving Xu Yan\u2019s office, Dong Xuebing thought for a while and went to thank Yang Yizhong and Liu Hua. After that, he went to thank Pang Bin and Yan Liang. No matter what\u2019s the reason they had voted for him, he must still thank them. If not, they might think of him as someone ungrateful.After visiting all the leaders, looked out of the window along the corridor.He thought he needs a few years to get promoted. He never expects his promotion to come so early!Civil Servant entrance exams\u2026\u2026 Joining the Party\u2026\u2026 Promoting to Deputy Chief\u2026\u2026 He was one more step closer to entering the Central Government!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

North Heping Street.It was early November, and it was chilly in the morning and evenings. There was a cold breeze. Dong Xuebing had only worn a shirt to work, and the material was not thick. But he was not cold. His whole body was burning due to his excitement.When Dong Xuebing was about to walk up the stairs, he saw his neighbor Section Chief Xu and his son, Xiao Dong.Xiao Dong, who was holding on to some reference books, the face changed when he saw Dong Xuebing. He keeps staring at Dong Xuebing.Section Chief Xu looked at Dong Xuebing for a while and told his son: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Xiao Dong looked away from Dong Xuebing and went up to the stairs with Section Chief Xu.It\u2019s been a while since Dong Xuebing met Xiao Dong. The last time they met was at the Civil Service Entrance Exams. Xiao Dong should be preparing for the next exams which werein the first quarter of the year. Dong Xuebing could felt the irony. Two months ago, he copied Xiao Dong\u2019s answers and barely pass the exams. Two months later, Xiao Dong was still preparing for the exams, and he was already a party member and a Deputy Chief!Level 3. Dong Xuebing pressed the doorbell of unit 302. Qu Yunxuan\u2019s unit.Ding-dong, Ding-dong. No one opens the door.Dong Xuebing was puzzled. At around 4 pm, Aunt Xuan had sent an SMS to him, telling him that she will prepare dinner. How come she was not at home? Dong Xuebing took out the spare key given to him by Aunt Xuan and opened the door. He wants to help wash the vegetables and cut the meat first. But when he entered the apartment, he could smell the fragrance of shampoo. It was the familiar smell of Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo.\u201cXiao Bing?\u201d Qu Yunxuan walked out from the bathroom with only a white towel. Lots of her fair skin was showing. Her deep cleavage, long legs\u2026\u2026 She was sexy\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing immediately bushed. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you are at home. I\u2026\u2026 had pressed the doorbell, and no one opened the door.\u201cI am using the hair dryer just now and didn\u2019t hear the doorbell.\u201d Qu Yunxuan lowered her head and looked at herself. She was also blushing.\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026 I will go back first.\u201d\u201cWhy are you going back? Come in and close the door.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026..\u201d Dong Xuebing quickly closes the door. He was afraid other people will see his Aunt Xuan wrapped in a towel.In the living room, Qu Yunxuan flicked her damp hair and poured Dong Xuebing a glass of tea. \u201cHave some tea first. I need to change.\u201d She was gentle, and her breath smells of alcohol.After Qu Yunxuan closes the door, Dong Xuebing realized what happened. \u201cYou are drinking just now?\u201dQu Yunxuan replied from the room: \u201cYes. I drank with a client during lunch. I am still feeling giddy now.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t drink, don\u2019t drink. You might get drunk.\u201d Dong Xuebing was worried.\u201cHaha, I know. When I meet clients, I will normally bring Xiao Tao from my team. I seldom drink when I am meeting clients. But I had no choice today.\u201d The bedroom\u2019s door opened. Qu Yunxuan walked out. She was wearing a cream colored silk slip dress, and she adjusts the temperature of the air conditioner. She turned to Dong Xuebing and smiled. \u201cTell me what you want to have for dinner?\u201d\u201cOh, I need to tell you something first.\u201d Dong Xuebing said. He was excited to share this good news with her.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Qu Yunxuan laughed and rolled her eyes. \u201cLook how happy you are. You are grinning like a fool.\u201d\u201cHehehe\u2026. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d Dong Xuebing cleared his throat and paused for a while. \u201cOur branch has a Party Committee Meeting this morning. After discussion, they decided to promote me to be the General Affairs Department\u2019s Deputy Chief. But because of my length of service and experience, my rank is still the same, but my salary and benefits had increased. That\u2019s all.\u201d Branch Bureaus under Direct-controlled municipality are Divisional level agencies. The General Affairs Department is Section level, and the General Affairs Office under the General Affairs Department is Deputy Section level. Unless it was those senior officials like Zhou Changchun that was promoted to the rank of Deputy Chief, the rest of the deputy chiefs can only receive Deputy Chief rank\u2019s salaries and benefits, and not hold the actual rank.Qu Yunxuan sat down beside Dong Xuebing on the sofa and moved closer to him. She playfully knocked his head 3 times: \u201cStop bluffing!\u201dDong Xuebing replied anxiously. \u201cIt true. The order will be out these two days!\u201dQu Yunxuan raised her arm to scare him: \u201cYou really think I am drunk? I will beat you if you still try to bluff me.\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026 Aunt Xuan, it\u2019s real. I am not lying. Almost everyone in my branch knows about this.\u201d\u201cYou are only 23 years old and have just entered the bureau for less than 2 months.\u201d Qu Yunxuan still does not believe him.Ring, ring, ring\u2026.. Dong Xuebing\u2019s iPhone 4 rang. He answered. The caller spoke loudly, and Qu Yunxuan could hear it. \u201cHello? Is this Chief Dong? I am Old Liu from the Political Section. I am calling to congratulate on your promotion. Hahaha. I was still telling my wife about you yesterday. I told her that you are very capable, and you will be promoted soon. I am right. Come over to my place for dinner some time. I will ask my wife to cook something good for you.\u201d\u201cThank You Chief Liu\u2026\u2026 I will visit you at your place some other day.\u201dAfter hanging up, Dong Xuebing smiled and waved his HP at Qu Yunxuan. \u201cDid you hear what he said?\u201dQu Yunxuan was stunned. \u201cXiao Bing! You are really the Chief of your office?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Deputy Chief.\u201d\u201cDeputy Chief is also a Chief!\u201d Qu Yunxuan reached out and pinched Dong Xuebing\u2019s cheeks, shaking his left and right. \u201cSince when you become so capable? How old are you and you are getting the Deputy Chief\u2019s salary and benefits? Tell me, why are you so capable?!\u201dDong Xuebing was slightly embarrassed by Qu Yunxuan\u2019s praises. \u201cHehe, it\u2019s all luck.\u201dQu Yunxuan seems to be more excited than Dong Xuebing. \u201cNo. We must celebrate your promotion. Eh, you should have told me earlier. If I know about your promotion earlier, I will buy more food back. Why not we eat out today?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to be so troublesome. Just any two dishes will do.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Qu Yunxuan got up and wore her apron. \u201cI will cook a wonderful dinner for you now.\u201dDong Xuebing rolled up his sleeves and followed: \u201cLet me help you.\u201dQu Yunxuan turned and poked his head, making Dong Xuebing move a few steps back. \u201cMy little Chief, you don\u2019t need to do anything today. Just sit there and wait for dinner.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thank you.\u201d\u201cHurry up and eat. Try my braised pork belly.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s hot and delicious.\u201d\u201cEat more. Have some fish too.\u201dDong Xuebing let out a loud burp after dinner and sat at the sofa with Aunt Xuan to watch the news. In the past, Dong Xuebing seldom watch TV. It was because there were no TV in his university hostel and his family was poor. Whenever he has free time, he will be working part-time to make ends meet. He does not have the time to think of the current affairs. But now, Dong Xuebing was a leader, and he changed. He needs to take note of the current affairs as this will be useful for his future prospect.On TV, the Central Government officials were talking about housing reforms.Qu Yunxuan laughed and teased Dong Xuebing. \u201cOur Xiao Bing is interested in news now?\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. \u201cI need to work hard for my future.\u201d\u201cMy advice to you is not to aim too high.\u201d Qu Yunxuan crossed her legs. But she remembered she was wearing a short slip dress and she quickly closed her legs and playfully pinched Dong Xuebing\u2019s nose. \u201cYou must be lucky to get promoted, and you must cherish this opportunity. You must secure your position first and don\u2019t think of climbing up too soon. Your foundations are too week and lack the experience. Take one step at a time.\u201dDong Xuebing slowly nodded. \u201cI know. I will try not to make any mistakes first.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It is not easy to be a leader. You have to take care of your relationships with others.\u201dThe news ended, and after the advertisements, it was the weather report.While watching the weather report, Qu Yunxuan was rubbing her the back of her neck. \u201cIt will be cold tomorrow? Remember to wear more clothes tomorrow.\u201dDong Xuebing acknowledged and looked at Qu Yunxuan\u2019s neck curiously. \u201cAre you having shoulder aches? Is it because of dinner just now? I said I will help you, but you refused.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about making dinner. These few days I am very busy with work and have no time to rest.\u201d\u201cHere, sit straight. I will massage your shoulders.\u201d\u201cHehe, no need. I will be fine after a good night sleep.\u201d\u201cWe are so close, you don\u2019t need to be so polite to me. Hurry and sit upright.\u201d\u201cOk\u2026\u2026 Fine. After the massage can you help me do Gua Sha?\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Dong Xuebing had designs on Qu Yunxuan. He was not far from fulfilling Aunt Xuan\u2019s dream of setting up her own company. Now, he aimed to get into Aunt Xuan\u2019s good books, and this way, she will agree to be his girlfriend in the future. Dong Xuebing took out the Gua Sha oil and scrapper. He dripped a few drops of oil on Aunt Xuan\u2019s neck and start the Gua Sha. \u201cAunt Xuan, if you have neck aches in the future, let me know. I will help you with Gua Sha or massage.\u201dQu Yunxuan, who was sitting upright with her head face down, smiled. \u201cOk. Thank you.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to thank me. You have been cooking and doing the laundry for me these two months. I should be the one thanking you.\u201d Dong Xuebing was standing behind the backrest of the sofa, looking at Qu Yunxuan\u2019s fair neck. She was leaning slightly forward, and Dong Xuebing could see the fullness of her bosom through the opening of her dress from the top. Dong Xuebing could feel his temperature rising. His first reaction was to tiptoe to try to see more of Qu Yunxuan.\u201cXiao Bing, is it done?\u201dDong Xuebing quickly looked away and replied. \u201cYes. It is very red.\u201dQu Yunxuan bunched up her hair and said. \u201cMy left shoulder is aching the most. Help me, Gua Sha, that part.\u201d\u201cOk\u2026\u2026 Ah\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s all purple now. You caught a wind?\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I forgot to close the windows last night.\u201dThe last time when Dong Xuebing massaged Qu Yunxuan was through her clothes. But this time, he was rubbing her smooth back. The feeling was different. After Dong Xuebing performed Gua Sha on Qu Yunxuan\u2019s neck and upper back, his hand was aching.\u201cYou are tired? Take a break.\u201d Qu Yunxuan grabbed his hand and massaged it.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Are you feeling better?\u201d\u201cYes. I can feel the knots on my neck loosen.\u201dDong Xuebing knew that Qu Yunxuan\u2019s impression of him had increased. It might not be a lot, but it was better than none. He knew it will take time for her to change her impression of him. He looked at Qu Yunxuan, who was gently massaging his hand. He could feel the warmth of her hands, and he thought to himself. \u2018Is this considered holding hands? Huh? This should not be holding hands. Sighed\u2026\u2026 when can I hold her hands?\u2019Dong Xuebing asked himself the same question again. Does Aunt Xuan like him?Dong Xuebing had asked Qu Yunxuan whether if she would consider dating him after she set up her own company, during his second confession in the hospital. Qu Yunxuan did not answer him and avoided the question. She should like me, but she was too shy to admit it\u2026\u2026. But her reaction might also be she does not like me and did not want to reject me directly\u2026\u2026.Does she like me or not?How does she feel about me? Could it be that she is in between?Qu Yunxuan released his hand and smiled: \u201cOk. You watch TV by yourself. I will go and soak the beans, and we will have beans porridge tomorrow morning.\u201dThe TV was playing the opening theme song of a drama. The melody is gentle and sweet.Dong Xuebing felt it was a pleasant ambiance. He blinked and mustered his courage to grab Qu Yunxuan\u2019s hand. He wants to see if she will allow him to hold her hands. If she allows, that means she likes Dong Xuebing. But if she shies away, that means\u2026\u2026 nothing. She might not mean anything even if she dodged.Half a second\u2026\u2026One second\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing\u2019s fingers held Qu Yunxuan tightly. He was looking forward to her reaction.Qu Yunxuan looked at him sternly and retracted her hand. \u201cWhat are you doing? You have no respect for your elder! Are you looking for a beating?\u201dShe hides from me!She still does not accept me!Dong Xuebing immediately said the magic word silently. BACK!!!\u2026\u2026\u201cI will go and soak the beans, and we will have beans porridge tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cOk. Add more barley rice. I like to eat barley rice.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dDong Xuebing!You still need to try harder!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayToday was the first day after the official orders came out.Morning. Dong Xuebing looked at himself in the mirror and adjust the suit he was wearing. He purposely leaves home slightly later and made his way slowly to work. Why did he intentionally go to work late? Dong Xuebing understood why all the leaders in the government agencies went to work a few minutes late. That\u2019s to show their status. If the leader was earlier than the staff members, then what\u2019s the difference between being the leader and the rest? He needs to show his staffs that he got the privilege to be late.Branch Bureau\u2019s compound.\u201cGood morning Chief Dong.\u201d\u201cChief Dong.\u201dA few staff members from other departments greeted Dong Xuebing politely.It was pleasant to his ears. Dong Xuebing smile and nodded. \u201cGood morning\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the past, Dong Xuebing walked around his workplace at a fast pace. This was to leave an impression with the leaders that he was hardworking and eager. But now, Dong Xuebing slowed down. He needs to create a steady image. His position was different now, and the things he had to consider was also changed. Dong Xuebing slowly got the hang of how a leader should behave.He walked along the corridor and entered the General Affairs Office.The moment he stepped in, there were sounds of chairs dragging. Tan Limei, Zhuang Zhi, Changjuan, Guo Panwei and the rest stood up.Changjuan, with thick makeup, smiled: \u201cChief Dong, you are here.\u201dTan Limei awkwardly greets: \u201cGood morning Chief Dong.\u201dOld Yan and Zhuang Zhi also greeted him as Chief Dong.Two days had passed. Guo Shunjie and Guo Panwei had accepted the fact that Dong Xuebing had become their superior. But both their attitudes were different. Guo Shunjie was the last one to stand up. He unwillingly greeted Dong Xuebing: \u201cChief Dong.\u201d Then he pulled a long face and return back to his sit to type something. Guo Panwei seems to have gotten over the fact that he did not become the Deputy Chief. He smiled at Dong Xuebing and politely said: \u201cChief Dong, I have cleaned up the office for you. If you feel it is still not clean, let me know.\u201dHehehe, this Guo Panwei knows his place.Dong Xuebing had expected Guo Shunjie to react this way. But he did not expect Guo Panwei to change so fast. But Dong Xuebing was still satisfied with his performance. Dong Xuebing imitated Zhou Changchun and nodded slightly. \u201cThere is a meeting at 10 am in meeting room 3. Guo Panwei, Guo Shunjie, both of you go and set up the meeting venue. Xiao Tan will prepare the materials for the meeting. Prepare 12 sets. Changjuan, Sun Zhuang, both of you go to Chief Xu\u2019s office later. There are some documents to be delivered.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s position was different now, and he had to change the way he addresses his colleagues. It does not matter after work, but at work, he cannot use the nicknames \u201cTan Zhi, Zhuang Zhi\u201d anymore.Guo Panwei replied immediately. \u201cYes. I will go now.\u201dGuo Shunjie did not say a word. But he stood up and went upstairs with a sullen face.After assigning the tasks, Dong Xuebing entered his small office. The room was tidied up, and it was spotless. The things left behind by Zhou Changchun were removed. Dong Xuebing sat down on the comfortable office chair and switched on the PC. He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. He thought back about the feeling of assigning tasks earlier. He was still not accustomed to it. Luckily, he had practiced several times last night. If not, he might stutter just now.Dong Xuebing hummed a tune and brewed a cup of tea for himself. He then played minesweeper on the PC. This is the advantage of being a leader. Everything can be delegated out to the rest, and the leader does not need to do anything.After a while, someone knocked on the door. The knocking was soft.Dong Xuebing could tell the person knocking on his door should not be a leader. He closes the minesweeper and said sternly: \u201cCome in.\u201dThe door opened, and Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi entered.After closing the door, Zhuang Zhi scratched his head and smiled to Dong Xuebing. \u201cBing Zhi, that\u2026\u2026\u201dTan Limei jumped and quickly poked Zhuang Zhi\u2019s waist. She suddenly interrupts: \u201cChief Dong, there is a document that needs your signature.\u201d She was furious at Zhuang Zhi. She had reminded him several times yesterday to be respectful to Dong Xuebing. They cannot treat Dong Xuebing as friends anymore. Dong Xuebing was now their direct superior. They cannot address him as Bing Zhi anymore!Zhuang Zhi blushed and looked at Dong Xuebing. \u201cChief Dong, this is the document from Chief Xu.\u201dDong Xuebing was speechless. \u201cTan Zhi, Zhuang Zhi, don\u2019t behave this way. When there is no one around, you all can still call me Bing Zhi.\u201dTan Limei looked at Dong Xuebing nervously: \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 this is not right.\u201d\u201cSave it.\u201d Dong Xuebing laughed. \u201cWhen I hear you calling me Chief, you give me the feeling that you are up to something no good.\u201dTan Limei stared at him: \u201cWho is up to no good? Hmph! You are the one who said this, I will call you Bing Zhi. Bing Zhi, sign here!\u201dZhuang Zhi laughed and passed the document over.\u201cOk. Let me take a look first.\u201d Dong Xuebing scanned through the document and signed it. \u201cSend it to the filing department.\u201dTan Limei smiled and replied in a weird tone: \u201cChief Bing Zhi, you are so successful now. Don\u2019t forget us when you become a director of a department or the Branch Bureau Chief in the future. Zhuang Zhi and I will follow your footsteps closely.\u201d She expressed her desire that they will become Dong Xuebing\u2019s loyal aides.Dong Xuebing replied: \u201cI barely got this position and you are talking about bureau chief? Stop teasing me. But as long as I am in the General Affairs Office, I will make sure no one will bully you all.\u201d\u201cHahaha. We will remember your words.\u201d Dong Xuebing did not put on the airs of a leader in from of them, and Tan Limei was glad. She returned to her usual ways of being straightforward. But she still has to be careful of her words when speaking to Dong Xuebing. She cannot speak her mind without thinking.After Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi left, Dong Xuebing thought about how he could improve this office.A new broom sweeps clean. Should he do something about the office?Who should he target first? Who else? Guo Shunjie, of course!Dong Xuebing also knew that if he creates trouble for Guo Shunjie, who had grudges with him in the past, others will see him as someone petty. But Guo Shunjie had been bullying him since the day he joined the bureau and had even claimed that he kicks him out of the bureau when he becomes the Deputy Chief. Now, Dong Xuebing was promoted instead of him. There was no way Dong Xuebing would let him off. Take care of him and let him off to show others that he was a magnanimous person?Damn! Who cares about all these?I must take revenge on him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay10 am.Dong Xuebing was about to call Guo Shunjie into his office when Guo Panwei knocked on the office. Guo Panwei had also ordered Dong Xuebing around in the past, and Dong Xuebing does not like him. Furthermore, Guo Panwei does not have any strong backings. Other than being close to Chief Pang, there were rumors that his uncle was a leader in the Customs. This was the reason Guo Panwei was the second person to be dealt with.\u201cChief Dong, I have completed my task. Is there any other orders?\u201d\u201cThe meeting room is set up?\u201d Dong Xuebing asked.Guo Panwei smiled. \u201cI have arranged it according to your instructions. Everything is in order.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. He picked up his teacup and realized his tea had gone cold. He placed the cup back on the desk.Guo Panwei saw it and immediately bring over the hot water flask. He poured the hot water into Dong Xuebing cup. \u201cPlease have some tea.\u201d\u201cHmmm.\u201d Dong Xuebing was surprised. This Guo Panwei really knows how to curry favor. He was also very shameless. Dong Xuebing was much younger than him, and he could still bow down. Dong Xuebing knew that he could never behave like Guo Panwei. He was quite impressed by Guo Panwei, and he hesitated for a while. Since Guo Panwei knows his place now, then I will deal with him some other time. I will observe his performance first. \u201cCall Guo Shunjie in.\u201dGuo Panwei nodded and left the office.About 10 seconds later, someone knocked on the door softly.Dong Xuebing sneered. \u201cCome in!\u201d Guo Shunjie sullen face looks like his father had just passed away. Dong Xuebing can\u2019t be bothered to speak to him. He just threw a stack of documents on the table. \u201cEnter these data into the system and do a back up on these documents. Do it immediately. I want it before the end of the day!\u201d If Tan Limei were to enter these data, she would take at most 3 to 4 hours. But for Guo Shunjie, he will need at least 7 to 8 hours.Guo Shunjie gritted his teeth. \u201cI have to complete this alone?\u201dDong Xuebing looked at him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dGuo Shunjie was cursing and swearing in his heart. He kept his anger and carried the documents out.After Guo Shunjie left, Dong Xuebing pressed the intercom, and Tan Limei answered. Dong Xuebing said: \u201cTan Zhi, I have given Guo Shunjie a document to type. Please help me monitor and don\u2019t let others help him. He got to do that alone.\u201dTan Limei laughed when she heard that. \u201cOk. I know what to do.\u201dOne month ago, Guo Shunjie had given his work to Dong Xuebing, Zhuang Zhi and Tan Limei. Now, it\u2019s payback time.The whole afternoon, all the staff members had nothing to do except for Guo Shunjie. He had been typing furiously since morning. 7 hours had passed, and Guo Shunjie was exhausted. His back was killing him, and fingers numb. Guo Shunjie and the rest of his colleagues did not have a good relationship. Tan Limei, Changjuan, Old Yan, and the rest were looking at him. They were enjoying themselves.When it was almost time to knock off, Guo Shunjie managed to finish typing the document and pass the Word document to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing saved a copy into his PC but did not ask Guo Shunjie to sit down. He opened up the file and start reading the document. 10 minutes, 20 minutes\u2026\u2026 Dong Xuebing was furious. He stared at Guo Shunjie and imitated Yang Yizhong and other leaders. \u201cWhat are you doing? Ah? You can\u2019t even complete a simple task? Do you even know what you are typing? Did you even go to school? The whole document is full of wrong words. What am I supposed to do with it? You want me to submit this report to the higher ups?\u201dGuo Shunjie turned pale. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time!\u201d\u201cStop finding excuses!\u201d Dong Xuebing banged the table. \u201cXiao Tan also uses the same amount of time to type out a report. How come she can do it and not you? You have a smaller brain than Xiao Tan, or are you missing one limb?\u201d Dong Xuebing paused for a while. \u201cI am telling you that I want this document today no matter what. If you can\u2019t finish, you stay back and finish it. You are not allowed to go back unless you finish this!\u201dGuo Shunjie was furious and was cursing Dong Xuebing in his heart. Damn! I will kill you and then\u2026\u2026 He left the office to work on the report.Before the office door was closed, Tan Limei gave a thumbs up to Dong Xuebing from under the table.Dong Xuebing saw it and smile and winked back at her.Changjuan saw Guo Shunjie being dealt with by the newly promoted Deputy Chief and was worried. Just two days ago, Guo Shunjie was still arrogant and confident that he will be promoted. But now, he was the first to get into trouble. Changjuan remembered that day when the Party Committee Meeting was still ongoing, she had advice Dong Xuebing to bow down to Guo Shunjie, and she was feeling uneasy. She was worried that Dong Xuebing would bear grudges against her.The more she thinks, the more she got worried. It was almost time to knock off, and Changjuan touched up her makeup before knocking on Dong Xuebing\u2019s office door.\u201cCome in.\u201dAfter entering the office, Changjuan closes the door behind her and faced Dong Xuebing with a seductive smile. \u201cChief Dong.\u201dDong Xuebing could feel her gaze on him. \u201cHave a seat. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dChangjuan sat down with only half her butt on the chair. \u201cChief Dong, I would like to apologize to you. You also know that I don\u2019t know how to keep my mouth shut. That afternoon on the day of the Committee Meeting, I\u2026\u2026 Please forgive me. I\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned for a second and remembered what she was talking about. He laughed. \u201cSister Chang, take it easy. You are also trying to help me, and I understand that. You don\u2019t need to apologize to me over such a trivial matter. I still thought you have done something wrong.\u201dChangjuan heard Dong Xuebing calling her Sister Chang, she felt better. \u201cHehehe, I knew Chief Xiao Dong will not blame me. Ah\u2026\u2026 If there is no one around, can I call you Chief Xiao Dong? Will you be angry with me?\u201d These words sounded reasonable, but Changjuan\u2019s tone was seductive, especially when she says, \u201cno one around.\u201d It seemed awkward.Dong Xuebing coughed. \u201cSister Chang, it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to knock off. You should go back early. Do you need to fetch your child?\u201d\u201cMy husband will fetch my child.\u201d Changjuan laughed. \u201cChief Xiao Dong, I will go back first. If you need me in any way, just let me know.\u201d She moved her right leg outwards, and her skirt was stretched opened. Dong Xuebing could almost see everything under her skirt.Damn! What is she doing now?Dong Xuebing could feel his temperature rising. After Changjuan left the office, Dong Xuebing wiped the sweat off his forehead.Wow\u2026\u2026 It was a special day today. There was too many the first time.It was Dong Xuebing\u2019s first time becoming a leader, his first time ordering his subordinates, his first time scolding someone, his first time being pleased by others, his first time being seduced\u2026\u2026No wonder everyone wants to be officials. This is the perks of having authority!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBecause Dong Xuebing had to monitor Guo Shunjie editing of the document, he left work later than usual.This was the first time Dong Xuebing experienced the feeling having authority. He walked slowly towards his apartment. When he was about to enter the building, he heard the sound of windows opening and a bag of trash was thrown out from a fourth story. Bang! The bag of trash landed beside garbage sorting bins at the ground floor. The plastic bag of trash broke from the impact, and the garbage was spewed all over the place. Some leftover soup splashed onto Dong Xuebing\u2019s shoes and socks. The feeling was grossed!It\u2019s from Section Chief Xu\u2019s unit!Dong Xuebing stood there in a daze for a while and looked at his dirty leather shoes. His anger was rising!\u201cXu Dong! Are you fucking blind? Did you do that on purpose?\u201d Chief Xu\u2019s whole family had this habit of throwing their garbage out of their windows. There was once the trash almost hit Dong Xuebing and his mother. But at that time, Dong Xuebing\u2019s family do not have any authority and dare not offend Section Chief Xu, who was working for the government. But now, Dong Xuebing was also an official, and he knew the custom officials had limited authorities. This was why he dare to shout at the fourth story window. \u201cHow many times has it been? Ah? Who will throw their garbage like this?! Is this your family\u2019s upbringing?\u201dDong Xuebing did not know if it was Xiao Dong or his parents who threw the garbage. So, he just scolded the whole family.Many windows in the building opened to look at the commotion. There were also some residents who had just returned from work standing there to watch. Everyone living in that building was furious with Chief Xu\u2019s family arrogance. But no one dares to offend them. Now everyone was glad to see Dong Xuebing, who had become a Civil servant scolding the Xu family. All of them felt good!Suddenly, Xiao Dong\u2019s head appeared from the fourth story\u2019s window: \u201cFuck! Who are you scolding?\u201dDong Xuebing looked up at him and shouted: \u201cI am scolding you! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cFuck you!\u201d Xiao Dong was still feeling sore when Dong Xuebing passed the entrance exams. He was pissed with Dong Xuebing, and he spits out for the window.Dong Xuebing quickly dodged, and the spit landed just centimeters away from him. It was a narrow escape.Xiao Dong had a smirk on his face, and he closes the window.Dong Xuebing was furious. \u201cDamn! Fuck!\u201d Dong Xuebing had never scolded so many vulgarities in life. He still wanted to hurl more vulgarities, but he saw Qu Yunxuan running out of the building towards him. Dong Xuebing swallowed all the vulgarities as he did not want to leave any wrong impression with Qu Yunxuan. No women would like a guy full of vulgarities.\u201cXiao Bing, what happened?\u201d\u201cNothing. Let\u2019s talk upstairs.\u201dDong Xuebing returned back to his unit and explained to Aunt Xuan what happened as he changed his socks.After hearing the whole incident, Qu Yunxuan\u2019s face changed. \u201cThis is too much! They are bullying others!\u201dDong Xuebing pulled a long face. \u201cI suspect he is targeting me. If I am not downstairs, he will not throw that garbage bag!\u201d\u201cNo! We cannot let this matter rest!\u201d Qu Yunxuan picked up the dirty socks from the floor and place it in a pail with detergent. She frowned and said angrily. \u201cXiao Bing, you stay here and watch TV by yourself. I will go upstairs to reason with them. How can they be so arrogant? How can they not apologize to you?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat first. After dinner, we will go and look for them. I will not let this matter rest!\u201d The Xu family had been looking down on Dong Xuebing and his mother since the day they moved into this building. Before the Civil Service Exams, Section Chief Xu and Xiao Dong were mocking Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother. This incident today was the breaking point for Dong Xuebing. He will no longer tolerate this family any longer. No matter what, he must get them to apologize!All his mood was gone, and the dinner felt tasteless.After dinner, Dong Xuebing went to the bathroom to wash his feet again. He looked at the pair of new leather shoes. This pair of shoes were given to him by Aunt Xuan. Food stains were hard to remove, and this pair of shoes could not be worn anymore. Dong Xuebing was boiling. He put on a pair of canvas shoes and was about to go upstairs.Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong\u2026\u2026 Someone rang the doorbell.Dong Xuebing thought to himself. I still have not gone up, and you are here to find trouble with me?! Fine!Qu Yunxuan went to open the door with a black face!The person at the door was shocked as the door was opened forcefully. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 Is this Chief Dong\u2019s house?\u201d It was Guo Panwei at the door!Qu Yunxuan was surprised too. She immediately smiles. \u201cYes. May I know who you are?\u201d She could see Dong Xuebing nodding from the corner of her eyes, and she steps aside to let him enter.Guo Panwei cautiously said: \u201cNice to meet you. I am Guo Panwei. One of the staff members under Chief Dong.\u201d He was carrying a plastic bag, and there were two items wrapped in newspaper in it. After entering the unit, he saw Dong Xuebing. He immediately smiles. \u201cChief Dong, sorry I did not tell you before coming. Errr\u2026\u2026 these two cartons of cigarettes are a small gift for you. Ah\u2026\u2026 you are still having dinner? Sorry. I will not disturb you.\u201d He left his gift there and was about to leave.Here to send gifts?Dong Xuebing was surprised. \u201cI have just finished dinner. Don\u2019t leave so soon. Have a seat.\u201d\u201cAm I disturbing you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Have a seat.\u201d\u201cOk!\u201d Guo Panwei sat down on the chair where Dong Xuebing pointed just now. He sat cautiously with half his butt touching the chair.Qu Yunxuan almost laughed as she saw Dong Xuebing trying to act calm. She walked to the coffee table and poured Guo Panwei a cup of tea. \u201cHave some tea.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..! I will pour it myself!\u201d Guo Shunjie stood up to receive the cup of tea. \u201cThank you, sister.\u201dQu Yunxuan smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I will go back to do my laundry. Both of you can have a good chat.\u201dThis was the first time Dong Xuebing received gifts. It does not matter how much this gift was worth. It\u2019s the thought that matters. He was pleased with Guo Panwei\u2019s gift. He did not stop Qu Yunxuan from leaving as he wanted to have a casual chat with Guo Panwei. There are no everlasting friends nor everlasting enemies in the world.After Qu Yunxuan left, Dong Xuebing chatted with Guo Panwei.Suddenly, there was a commotion upstairs. They could hear the sounds of people arguing and scolding!It was Xiao Dong and Aunt Xuan\u2019s voices.Dong Xuebing\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Damn! Aunt Xuan went upstairs by herself to reason with the Xu family. He was afraid Aunt Xuan would get scolded by them, and he immediately walked upstairs.\u201d\u201cChief Dong\u2026\u2026\u201d Guo Panwei realized what happened and followed Dong Xuebing upstairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So what? The garbage bag also did not hit you!\u201d\u201cYou still refuse your mistake? Do you think what you have done it right?\u201d\u201cWhat I did is none of your business. If Dong Xuebing wants to fight, let him come and find me! What\u2019s wrong? He is scared of me? Hmph! Even if he does not come up to look for me, I will also go and look for him! My father had heard what he scolded just now. Sis Qu, go back and tell him to wait. He dares to scold my whole family? Fine! I will make sure he regret it!\u201d After Xiao Dong had failed his Civil Servant entrance exams and was failed in wooing Qu Yunxuan, he decided to give up on her. Now, Qu Yunxuan was speaking up for Dong Xuebing, and he was jealous! His tone towards Qu Yunxuan was rude!Qu Yunxuan did not expect to see Xiao dong\u2019s true colors. He had been courteous towards her, and he suddenly changed. She was furious. \u201cXiao Bing might be wrong to scold you all, but that is because you threw the garbage bag out of the window. You even dirtied his shoes. Even a mild tempered person will be angry\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWho are you? Do you have any place to speak here?\u201d Section Chief Xu stood in the middle of the living room and stared at Qu Yunxuan. \u201cI am lazy to bother with your kids. You go back and tell that brat. He will have to pay for what he said. He dares to scold my son and me? Who is he to scold us? He is working with the Public Security Bureau, right? Western District Branch? I know some leaders there. Tell that brat to work hard. Someone will take care of him!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Qu Yunxuan gritted her teeth. \u201cYou all are unreasonable!\u201dThe residents in the other units on the fourth story were looking out of their peephole and sticking their ears against the wall. All of them were interested to know what happened.Xiao Dong side glanced Qu Yunxuan. \u201cSis Qu, go back. This is none of your business. Don\u2019t interfere!\u201dQu Yunxuan was pissed. \u201cIf this matter is not sorted out, I will not leave! Xu Dong! Section Chief Xu! You all should not behave this way! You all have thrown your garbage out of the windows and hit Xiao Bing! You all don\u2019t even apologize to him, and now you still want to make use of your connections to bully him? Let everybody be the judge! How can you all behave this way?\u201dXiao Dong retorted. \u201cThis is the way my family does things! What\u2019s wrong?\u201dQu Yunxuan points at him angrily. \u201cXu Dong! You\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Dong Xuebing had heard the quarreling and rushed upstairs. He saw Aunt Xuan shaking with anger. He was furious. His blood was boiling. \u201cAunt Xuan! Who was the one scolded you just now?!\u201dSection Chief Xu sneered. \u201cI am the one!\u201dQu Yunxuan turned around and immediately pulled Dong Xuebing back. \u201cXiao Bing, you go back first. Let me handle this!\u201d\u201cWhat goes back first?!\u201d Dong Xuebing said. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t you all feel embarrassed? Fine! I will settle all the scores with you all today!\u201dXiao Dong laughed contemptuously.Section Chief Xu also laughed. \u201cYou want to settle the score with me? You? Who do you think you are?\u201d\u201cChief Dong!\u201d Guo Panwei caught up with Dong Xuebing and was surprised by what he saw. He immediately rushed forward and stood in front. \u201cChief Dong! Sis! Stand back! Leave this to me!\u201dGuo Panwei had been feeling uneasy these few days. He had ordered Dong Xuebing around when Dong Xuebing just entered the bureau. He was also rude to him on several occasions. But now, Dong Xuebing became the Deputy Chief and had the backing of Bureau Chief Xu, Bureau Chief Yang, and Secretary Song. Dong Xuebing was not someone Guo Panwei could offend now. This was why he had positioned himself lowly and tried to bootlick Dong Xuebing. He hopes to let Dong Xuebing changed his impression of him. He did not want to end up like Guo Shunjie.Now, Chief Dong had got into an argument with someone, and Guo Panwei felt this was the opportunity to impress him. No matter how many times he bootlicks, it will not be as impressive as helping Dong Xuebing solve his existing problem! This was only a fight. Even if he lost the fight, the leader would still feel his sincerity!\u201cChief Dong?\u201d Xiao Dong and Section Chief Xu laughed. \u201cWhat chief? You appointed yourself as chief?\u201dGuo Panwei was fuming. \u201cAre you asking for it? What are you saying?!\u201dXiao Dong stared at him coldly. \u201cYou are the one who is asking for it! Where are you from?\u201dDong Xuebing, who was standing beside, suddenly remembered something. He looked at Guo Panwei: \u201cYour uncle is also from the Customs?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Guo Panwei nodded. \u201cHuh? This family is also from Customs? Beijing Customs?\u201dGuo Panwei looked at Section Chief Xu. He looks familiar. Section Chief Xu also looked at Guo Panwei. He remembers seeing Guo Panwei before.Xiao Dong laughed. \u201cOh, such a coincident. What is your uncle\u2019s name? Go back and ask if he knows my father!\u201dAh? Guo Panwei was shocked. From the way this person speaks, that middle age man seems to be holding a high rank. Bureau Director rank or Deputy Bureau Director rank?Dong Xuebing saw Guo Panwei keeping quiet and was pissed. Didn\u2019t Guo Panwei say he will settle this?\u201cHuh? Why are you keeping quiet?\u201d Xiao Dong shouted arrogantly. \u201cI am asking you! What is your uncle\u2019s name?! I will ask my father to give him some special treatment!\u201dSection Chief Xu sneered. \u201cWhich department if your uncle in? Airport Customs? Zhongguancun Customs? Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone Customs? Or is he from the main office?\u201dHuh? Guo Panwei felt he had shot himself in the foot. He stood there without saying anything. He wanted to please Dong Xuebing, but he cannot get his uncle into trouble. He had a close relationship with his uncle.Dong Xuebing knew he could not rely on Guo Panwei. He stepped forward!Qu Yunxuan saw Dong Xuebing stepping forward. She immediately grabbed Dong Xuebing and shouted. \u201cSection Chief Xu! You are also a civil servant. You\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore Qu Yunxuan could continue, Guo Panwei interrupted. \u201cHuh? Sis, what did you say?\u201dQu Yunxuan was stunned. She looked at Guo Panwei. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201dGuo Panwei could not believe his ears. He stared at Xiao Dong. \u201cWho is your father? Section Chief Xu? Section Chief?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Xiao Dong replied confidently.\u201c@$#$^%$&amp;$%^@%#$^$%&amp;!!!!\u201d Guo Panwei also hurled all sorts of vulgarities at him. Damn! I had nearly lost face in front of Chief Dong! Who is this small Section Chief trying to scare? Dare to boost as if he was some big shot! I still thought you are the Bureau Director rank! Guo Panwei immediately puffed out his chest and did not even look at them. He smiled to Dong Xuebing. \u201cChief Dong watch me!\u201dXiao Dong said: \u201cI had asked earlier, what chief is he? He has only entered the government service for two\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou shut up!\u201d Guo Panwei did not look at Xiao Dong. He stared at Section Chief Xu. \u201cA Section Chief in Customs? Which department are you from? What is your name?\u201d Everyone was shocked. Guo Panwei suddenly slapped his forehead. \u201cI remember now. No wonder why I find you so familiar. There was once when I followed my uncle to the head office to do something, and you are the one who opened the car doors for us, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXiao Dong was stunned when he heard what Guo Panwei said. How could his father help other people open car doors?Section Chief Xu was shocked. \u201cYour uncle is\u2026\u2026\u201dGuo Panwei glanced at the both of them and said proudly: \u201cLiu Guowei!\u201dSection Chief Xu jumped. \u201cChief Liu? Chief Liu from Economic and Technological Development Zone Customs?\u201d He immediately looks at Guo Panwei\u2019s face. One second passed, two seconds passed, three seconds passed\u2026\u2026. Section Chief Xu remembered that day. He took in a deep breath and had an embarrassed look on his face. His face turned red immediately. \u201cAhh\u2026\u2026 You are Chief Liu\u2019s nephew\u2026\u2026 This\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s a misunderstanding. This is a misunderstanding!\u201dXiao Dong was still in shocked. \u201cDad!\u201dSection Chief Xu shouted: \u201cGet back to your room!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026\u201dFrom his father\u2019s reaction, Xiao Dong knew the other party\u2019s uncle was a higher rank than his father, and it was much higher. Yes. Section Chief Xu might be somebody in the main office, but compared to Chief Liu, he was miles behind. There were not on the same level. Section Chief Xu was regretting. If he knew this person was Chief Liu\u2019s relative, he would not say those words just now! Also, how did that brat become Chief Liu\u2019s nephew superior? Section Chief was puzzled.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a misunderstanding!\u201d Guo Panwei was not willing to let him off. \u201cTell me, which part of this matter is a misunderstanding?\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing was surprised to see Guo Panwei taking control of the whole situation. He exchanged looks with Qu Yunxuan and then give Guo Panwei an approval look. This Guo Panwei was really something, Dong Xuebing thought to himself.Guo Panwei saw the appreciative looks from Dong Xuebing, and he knew he had left a good impression with him. He immediately stares at Section Chief Xu and indirectly bootlicks Dong Xuebing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened in the past. But our Chief Dong is kind and generous to everyone. He has a mild temper. Since he has conflicts with your family, then it must be you have done something wrong and make Chief Dong angry!\u201dWhat Guo Panwei said was very unreasonable. But it was pleasant to Dong Xuebing\u2019s ears.Section Chief Xu did not dare to refute Guo Panwei. He wiped the cold sweat in his palms. \u201cIt\u2019s my son who is at fault. That\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStop finding excuses!\u201d Guo Panwei interrupted him. \u201cSince you all are at fault, why are you all still so arrogant? Who do you think you are? You still dare to scold my sister earlier? Damn! Who are you to scold him? Let me tell you! Scolding sis is the same as scolding our Chief Dong! Scolding Chief Dong is the same as scolding me, Guo Panwei! This is equivalent to scolding my uncle! What are you trying to do? Ah? You dare to scold my uncle? If I remember correctly, you should be a Section Chief at one of the branch offices? Your surname is Xu?! Fine! I will remember you!\u201dSection Chief Xu was panicking. How did this turn out to be scolding Chief Liu? He immediately tried to defend himself. \u201cNo. I did not scold Chief Liu\u2026\u2026\u201dGuo Panwei really knows how to handle such situations. He immediately passes the ball to Dong Xuebing. \u201cChief Dong, what do you think we should do? Just one word from you, I will call my uncle now.\u201dSection Chief Xu quickly shouted: \u201cNo! No! Xuebing, it\u2019s a misunderstanding. It\u2019s really a misunderstanding!\u201dDong Xuebing was feeling good from what Guo Panwei had said. He looked at the flustered Section Chief Xu and his humiliated son, Xiao Dong. His anger subsided. A few seconds later, Dong Xuebing looked at Qu Yunxuan and Guo Panwei. \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d Dong Xuebing had the upper hand right now, and he was not in a rush to make any decision.\u201cXuebing\u2026\u2026 Errr\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026.\u201d Section Chief Xu was at a loss for words.Guo Panwei let out a loud \u201cHmph!\u201d before following Dong Xuebing downstairs.At level 3, Guo Panwei smiled to Dong Xuebing. \u201cChief Dong, my uncle has some authority in Customs. It should not be a problem to transfer him out. It\u2019s late now, and you need to rest. I will go back first. If you need me for anything, just give me a call!\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. His impression of Guo Panwei had changed greatly. \u201cThen, I will not ask you to stay longer. Panwei, be careful on your way back.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Guo Panwei could read between the lines. Dong Xuebing had changed the way he addresses him. It was a load off his mind.One hour later.Unit 301. Dong Xuebing\u2019s living room.Dong Xuebing will not ask Guo Panwei to let his uncle transfer Section Chief Xu to a useless department. It was not about whether Guo Panwei would be able to persuade his uncle or whether if his uncle had the authority to order this transfer. It was because Dong Xuebing does not want to owe Guo Panwei any favors. Personal favors cannot be owe. Dong Xuebing and Qu Yunxuan were discussing how to settle this incident in the living room.Ding-dong, ding-dong. Someone was at the door.Qu Yunxuan blinked. \u201cI will get it.\u201d She got up and went to open the door.It was Section Chief Xu and Xiao Dong standing outside. Qu Yunxuan\u2019s face twitched and step aside to let them enter.Dong Xuebing knew what they wanted, but he still asked. \u201cWhat do you want from me, so late at night?\u201dSection Chief Xu pulled Xiao Dong towards him roughly and place a shoe box and two bottles of Maotai on the coffee table. He smiled: \u201cXuebing, I had drunk too much earlier and said something that offended you. Please don\u2019t mind what I said. Errr\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s this brat fault tonight. He should not have thrown rubbish out of the window. Hehe\u2026\u2026 I had brought him to the mall earlier to buy a pair of leather shoes for you. Oh, here are two bottles of alcohol. Please accept it.\u201d Section Chief Xu stared at his son: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?! Apologize to Xuebing now!\u201dXiao Dong\u2019s face was all red, but he did not utter a word.Section Chief Xu immediately gave him a slap. \u201cHurry up!\u201dXiao Dong gritted his teeth and said. \u201cI am sorry!\u201dDong Xuebing was ignoring both of them and sipping on his tea. But he was feeling great in his heart.Section Chief Xu smiled awkwardly and turned to Qu Yunxuan. \u201cYunxuan, I am feeling sober now, and I regretted what I said earlier. I should not have said those unpleasant words. If you are still sore over what I said, you can scold me now!\u201dQu Yunxuan shook her head.Section Chief Xu continued. \u201cI will not drink so much in the future. Yunxuan, we are all neighbors, please don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d After saying that, he gave Xiao Dong a kick.Xiao Dong lowered his head and said: \u201cSister Qu, I am too impulsive earlier. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at them and said: \u201cI always think that every one of us should be reasonable. You hit someone with the things you throw, and you should apologize. You all should not be arrogant and threaten others. If you apologize from the start, will there be so many troubles? We are all neighbors, and no one likes for things to turn out this way.\u201dXiao Dong\u2019s lips had turned purple. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201dSection Chief Xu slapped the back of Xiao Dong\u2019s head. \u201cI had spoiled him!\u201d He kept quiet for a few seconds and then said to Dong Xuebing. \u201cXuebing, I still have not congratulated you for your promotion. Hahaha, you have just entered the bureau, and you got promoted? Ah\u2026. You will have a bright future. Let\u2019s find a day to celebrate. I will treat you to dinner. Errr\u2026\u2026 Xuebing, can you tell Chief Liu\u2019s nephew\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing had a stern look on his face. But in his heart, he was laughing. They had apologized and compensated him with a pair of leather shoes and two bottles of Maotai. This was more than what he and Aunt Xuan had discussed earlier. They had only wanted to demand an apology and a new pair of shoes. Now, they received two bottles of expensive Maotai. But Dong Xuebing cannot accept the apology too quick. He kept quiet and looked at Qu Yunxuan.Section Chief Xu smiled awkwardly: \u201cYunxuan\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Yunxuan knew what Dong Xuebing had in mind. She paused for a while and sighed. \u201cYou all go back first. Let me speak to Xiao Bing.\u201dSection Chief Xu felt better. \u201cOk, ok. Thank you.\u201dXiao Dong said with a stiffed voice. \u201cThank you, Sister Qu.\u201d\u201cXuebing, we will go back first. We will treat you to dinner some other days.\u201dThe door closed, and the father and son went back.Qu Yunxuan walked back to the living room and saw Dong Xuebing still had a stern look on his face, pretending to drink his tea. She laughed and knocked his head playfully. \u201cStop pretending! They had left already. Are you trying to put on aires with me?\u201dDong Xuebing laughed and asked: \u201cAunt Xuan, are you feeling better?\u201dQu Yunxuan also laughed and rolled her eyes. \u201cYou ah\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s see what shoes did they buy for you.\u201d She turned and opened the shoebox. \u201cOh\u2026\u2026 this leather feels good, and it\u2019s branded. It is much more expensive than the pair I bought for you. The Maotai is also a costly brand. Oh, we still have not opened up the two cartons of cigarettes your colleague gave you.\u201d She walked over to the sofa and unwrapped the two cartons of cigarettes given by Guo Panwei. \u201cChunghwa brand? Two cartons? It cost a few hundred RMB for one carton.\u201dDong Xuebing suddenly stood up and said. \u201cI nearly forgot. Aunt Xuan, check if there is any cash in the gifts.\u201d\u201cCash?\u201d Qu Yunxuan checked the cigarettes and the Maotai boxes. She smiled and shook her head. \u201cThere is nothing in the Maotai boxes, and the cigarettes are still wrap up in a plastic wrap.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cOk. We must not do anything wrong.\u201d\u201cBut you still received the cigarettes? Isn\u2019t that wrong?\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026 This is different. Cigarettes and alcohol are usual gifts. But if money is given as gifts, it will be different. Money cannot be accepted!\u201d Dong Xuebing did not want to make this mistake over a small sum of money. It was not worth it.After keeping the cigarettes and alcohol, Qu Yunxuan stood in the living room, looking at Dong Xuebing for a long time.Dong Xuebing blushed and touched his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dQu Yunxuan smiled. \u201cSince the day Section Chief Xu was promoted, his family had become very arrogant. Everyone in the estate is afraid of offending them. Look at what happened earlier. Sighed\u2026\u2026 Our Xiao Bing had grown up and became successful. Now, people have come up to your apartment to give gifts and bootlick. When something happens, your subordinate will step forward to help you settle it. If it was our newspaper agency or a private company, a leader with the same rank will not be able to enjoy this respect and treatment.\u201dAfter hearing this, Dong Xuebing had a sense of achievement. That\u2019s right. He and his mother had to bow down to Section Chief Xu in the past whenever they met. They were afraid of offending this \u2018Big Shot.\u2019 But now? Section Chief Xu and Xiao Dong had lost face in front of him. In the future, they will try all means to avoid him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone who heard the news was shocked, and many do not believe it. But when they saw the gloomy look on Section Chief Xu and his family coming downstairs, they knew it was true. Section Chief Xu\u2019s family was moving out! Those residents who were strolling, playing chess, marketing, etc. were all talking about last night incident. Some said that Dong Xuebing had become a high ranking official and some said that Dong Xuebing had beat up Section Chief Xu and Xiao Dong, and they were too embarrassed to continue living in this building. They had no choice but to move out. All sorts of rumors were flying.Section Chief Xu and his family were finally moving out.Actually, the Customs had given Section Chief Xu an apartment more than 6 months ago, and they should have moved a long time ago. But Section Chief Xu was someone who wanted to be first in a village than second in Rome. There were many high ranking officers at the new apartment, and he was nothing there. He could not show off his status. Only in this small housing estate at North Heping Street, he could enjoy the sense of superiority. But now, after he was forced to bow down to Dong Xuebing, he could no longer live here. So, last night, Section Chief Xu contacted a housing agent to rent out this apartment and move out early this morning.Western District Branch Bureau, General Affairs Office.Dong Xuebing was sitting in his office with his legs crossed, reading the newspapers when he received an SMS from Qu Yunxuan. \u2018The Xu family had moved out.\u2019\u201cHuh? Move out over such a small matter?\u201d Dong Xuebing was surprised. He immediately replied to Qu Yunxuan. \u201cThen we will have peace in the future.\u201d Good riddance. Dong Xuebing also did not want to see their irritating faces. He put down his iPhone 4 and thought about last night\u2019s incident. The incident was settled because of Guo Panwei. Dong Xuebing picked up the phone on the desk and called outside. It was Tan Limei who answered it. \u201cTan Zhi, ask Guo Panwei to come into my office.\u201dA few seconds later, Guo Panwei knocked and entered the office. \u201cChief Dong, are you looking for me?\u201dDong Xuebing nodded and said: \u201cTomorrow I will be out of office. When I am not around, help me look after the rest of the staffs. Make sure everything in the office is in order. If I am not back in the afternoon, send the important documents or any documents which require a signature to Chief Xu Yan and let her handle it. Remember to handle those classified documents yourself. Just say it\u2019s my instructions if anyone questions you. I don\u2019t trust anyone else.\u201dGuo Panwei was on cloud nine. He replied excitedly. \u201cThank you for your trust in me. Rest assured, I will make sure everything in the office is in order. I will pay special attention to Guo Shunjie. Oh, should I increase his workload? He does not have much work every day. This will affect the other colleagues. If any leader comes in for rounds, they will think that our General Affairs Office have nothing to do.\u201d Guo Panwei had conflicts with Guo Shunjie a few days ago and had a grudge against him.\u2018You are very evil.\u2019 Dong Xuebing thought to himself. \u201cYou can make the decisions.\u201dGuo Panwei acknowledged. \u201cThen I will go back to work. If you need anything, just give me a call.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. After Guo Panwei left the office and closes the door, Dong Xuebing picked up a few forms and walk out of his room. Tan Limei and Guo Panwei immediately sit upright, and Changjuan quickly put down her eyebrow pencil and place her hands on the keyboard. Old Yan also put down his newspaper and pick up a piece of report. Guo Shunjie looked up and then continue typing furiously. Dong Xuebing was feeling great to see everyone\u2019s reaction. It feels good to be a leader!Dong Xuebing walked around the office and then went upstairs to Xu Yan\u2019s office to discuss his task tomorrow.After Dong Xuebing returned to his office, he sat down in his leather chair and sip on his tea. It was so relaxing at work.Just when Dong Xuebing was thinking about how to complete the task given to him by Deputy Chief Xu Yan, he heard people outside greeting \u201cDirector Li!\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s office door opened suddenly, and Li Qing walked in without knocking.Dong Xuebing was shocked. He immediately stands up. \u201cDirector Li.\u201d What was wrong? Why was Li Qing so furious?Li Qing looked at Dong Xuebing in his eyes and asked: \u201cChief Xu had given a task to the General Affairs Office in the morning? How can I am not informed?!\u201dDong Xuebing was stunned. \u201cAh\u2026\u2026. Chief Xu did not tell you about it?\u201dLi Qing shouted with a black face. \u201cTell me? Chief Xu is my leader! Does she have the need to report all these things to me? Chief Dong, what is wrong with you? The relocation of \u2018Guesthouse\u2019 is a critical mission ordered by Branch Bureau Party Committee! Fine! It\u2019s been several hours, and I, as the Chief of General Affairs Office, is still not aware of this task? If it weren\u2019t for Guo Shunjie, I still would not know about this mission given by the Committee and Chief Xu!\u201dGuo Shunjie?Damn! He backstabbed me!But this was also Dong Xuebing\u2019s fault. He had become conceited after his promotion to Deputy Chief. Also, Li Qing had left everything to him and seldom care about the work in the General Affairs Office. This was why Dong Xuebing forgot to inform him and went to Chief Xu Yan straight with the forms for approval. Damn. He had skipped his direct superior and went directly to the top leader. This was a taboo in the Government sector. Dong Xuebing had cold sweat when he thought about this. He knew why Li Qing was so furious. Although Li Qing had helped him in the past, he should not have done this!Dong Xuebing tried to explain himself: \u201cDirector, it\u2019s my oversight. I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t need to explain!\u201d Li Qing stared at Dong Xuebing and stormed out of the office. He was considering taking back all the authorities he had given to Dong Xuebing and the General Affairs Office.Guo Shunjie was laughing in his heart when he thought about what was going on in Dong Xuebing\u2019s office. Hahahaha. Serve you, right!Dong Xuebing chased after Li Qing: \u201cDirector! Director!\u201d Li Qing did not even look back. Dong Xuebing could see Guo Shunjie holding back his laughter and was furious. He stopped chasing immediately!Fuck!BACK!BACK!!BACK!!!\u2026\u2026The scenes changed!Dong Xuebing was holding on to a cup of hot tea and was still smiling. The moment time returns back to one minute ago, his smile disappeared. He quickly put down his teacup and grabs the few forms on his desk. He immediately rushes out of his office with the forms.Tan Limei, Guo Panwei, and the rest were shocked. They did not know what happened.Guo Shunjie could see Li Qing walking towards the main door of the General Affairs Office from the corner of his eyes, and he knew the show he was waiting for was starting. He smiled to himself and was waiting for Dong Xuebing to disgrace himself. Guo Shunjie had been tolerating Dong Xuebing and the other staff members these two days. He was waiting for a chance to make Dong Xuebing fall out of favor with the leaders. Guo Shunjie knew there were many unspoken rules in the government sector and the inexperienced Dong Xuebing could not be compared to him. Dong Xuebing will bound to make mistakes, and Guo Shunjie will use the opportunity to blow up his mistake. This morning, Guo Shunjie finally got the chance. He accidentally overheard that the Bureau will be giving the General Affairs Office an important task of preparing a proposal for the relocation of the \u2018Guesthouse\u2019 and he noticed Dong Xuebing going to Xu Yan\u2019s office several times. So, Guo Shunjie looked for an excuse to go to Li Qing\u2019s office and \u201cunintentionally\u201d mentioned about this task to him. He only wanted to try his luck. But who knows that this Dong Xuebing was too na\u00efve. He did not report this task to Chief Li Qing! Skipping the direct supervisor and going to the top management? Hahahaha. This was a deadly mistake!\u201cOh, Director Li, you are here?\u201d Dong Xuebing asked in shock.Li Qing was furious as he entered the office. He had high hopes for Dong Xuebing, but this time, Dong Xuebing had made a grave mistake. Li Qing had waited in his office for over an hour. He thought to himself that if Dong Xuebing went to report to him, he would let him off after some scoldings. But he waited for 2 hours, and Dong Xuebing did not even show up. This had crossed the line!Li Qing showed Dong Xuebing a black face and looked at him. He was about to question Dong Xuebing.But before Li Qing said anything, Dong Xuebing said something that surprised Li Qing and Guo Shunjie. Dong Xuebing said: \u201cDirector Li, I was just about to look for you to report a task!\u201dLi Qing stopped whatever he wanted to say. \u201cWhat task?\u201d\u201cOh, it is about the guesthouse. Errr\u2026\u2026 I had wanted to tell you about this in the morning. But I knocked on your office, and you are not around.\u201d Dong Xuebing made up an excuse.\u201cMorning? You went to look for me in the morning?\u201d Li Qing frowned.\u201cYes. I waited for quite a while.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 Maybe I went to the restroom.\u201dDong Xuebing passed the pieces of A4 papers to Li Qing. \u201cCan I write this form in this way?\u201dLi Qing\u2019s anger was slightly appeased and looked at the forms. He nodded slightly.Dong Xuebing continued: \u201cDirector, I should have informed you once I received the task, but you are not in your office, and Chief Xu needs it urgently. I am afraid that I would mess things up, so I made a draft of the proposal first. I wanted to report to you after I had completed it and you should be back by then.\u201dSo, this was the reason. Li Qing patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s shoulder and smile. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. In the future, just give me a call will do.\u201d\u201cHow can I do that? It\u2019s better to report to you personally. After all, you are the person in charge of the General Affairs Office, and I am only assisting you.\u201dLi Qing nodded. He knew he had misunderstood Dong Xuebing.\u201cOh, Director Li, you are looking gloomy just now. Did anything happened?\u201d\u201cHaha, nothing. I have a toothache.\u201dGuo Shunjie was furious as he saw Dong Xuebing and Li Qing chatting happily. He was sure that Dong Xuebing had forgotten to report to Li Qing. If not, Dong Xuebing would not be panicking 10 seconds before Li Qing arrived. But Guo Shunjie was not sure why Dong Xuebing could rush out at the last moment to save his skin. How did he know Li Qing was coming to the General Affairs Office? A coincidental?Dong Xuebing secretly wiped his sweat. It was a close shave!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was almost noon and nearing to the lunch break. Li Qing asked Dong Xuebing to go to the cafeteria with him. \u201cXuebing, do you have a girlfriend?\u201dHuh? This question again? Since the day Dong Xuebing entered the bureau, at least 4 people had asked the same question. He did not want to discuss this question. It was because he had never dated anyone before in his life\u2026\u2026 This was not something to be proud of. But he must answer whatever his superior asked. Dong Xuebing smiled awkwardly and replied: \u201cNot yet. I need to focus on my work first. Girlfriends can wait. I\u2019m not in a rush.\u201d This was obviously a lie!As both of them walked out of the grey building, Li Qing laughed: \u201cI have to scold you for that.\u201dDong Xuebing laughed.\u201cWork is work, and you cannot use it as an excuse to not look for a partner.\u201d Li Qing felt slightly guilty for misunderstanding Dong Xuebing earlier, and he wanted to advise him. \u201cYou are very young and have been promoted to the Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office. People will talk behind your back and unhappy with your promotion. I know you are capable, but your age is still an issue. That\u2019s why you should get a girlfriend and get married soon. Don\u2019t delay.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. Married?\u201dThey reached the cafeteria, and Li Qing patted Dong Xuebing\u2019s back. \u201cThink about it yourself.\u201dIf Li Qing did not give Dong Xuebing this advice, Dong Xuebing will still not think about this problem. Indeed, if he were married and had a family, he would give others the impression that he was more mature than now. It will overcome his age issue, and it will be good for his career. But Dong Xuebing did not know whether to laugh or cry. Where can he find someone to get married? Who should he get married with? But when he thought about his future wife, two women appeared in his mind. One was Qu Yunxuan, and the other was\u2026\u2026 the woman whom he used BACK to help her get back her catch the pickpocket. The woman who said she will call him to treat him to dinner. That gorgeous and sexy woman!Damn. How come I am thinking about her?Dong Xuebing shook his head to remove the image of that woman from his head. She had not called him after so long and should have forgotten about him. He should have no chance to meet her again in the future. Thus, his only choice left was Qu Yunxuan. If he could date Qu Yunxuan, then it should be a happy ending. Sighed\u2026.. But what was Qu Yunxuan thinking now? Damn. This was not the time to be thinking about this. Dong Xuebing must still save up 1 million RMB to set up a company for Qu Yunxuan first. In the meanwhile, he must think of ways to capture her heart. With these two methods, Dong Xuebing vow to get Qu Yunxuan within two months!That\u2019s right! Make money first! Even if wasn\u2019t for Aunt Xuan, Dong Xuebing also want to have more money for himself!Cars, gifts, a house, etc. Everything needs money.The two most important tasks now were making money and capturing her heart.\u2026\u2026Next morning.The air was dry and cold. Dried leaves were all over the footpaths.Dong Xuebing, in a jacket, alighted from the bus. He went to his office first. At around 10 am, he walked out of Xu Yan\u2019s office with a stack of documents and a digital camera. He went over to Li Qing\u2019s office to report to him and went back to the General Affairs Office. He gave some instructions to his staffs and then walked out of the Bureau to get a taxi to Youanmen.Western District Branch Bureau\u2019s \u2018Guesthouse\u2019 was located at Youanmen. The surrounding low-level houses and several buildings had to be relocated. The \u2018Guesthouse\u2019 which was used to receive reports from intelligence officers, was located right in the middle of this place. This \u2018Guesthouse\u2019 had to be shifted. The Party Committee had discussed and decided to let Chief Xu be in charge of this. A proposal was needed, and the pictures of the present location were required by the City Bureau. If the City Bureau approved this proposal, then the Branch Bureau can start the shifting of the \u2018Guesthouse.\u2019 Dong Xuebing\u2019s job today was to write a report.After walking along the City river towards the west, Dong Xuebing arrived at his destination.Bang, bang, bang, ding, ding, ding, dong, dong\u2026\u2026 Dust was flying everywhere. About a dozen construction workers were demolishing the houses.Dong Xuebing cough due to the dust. He covered his nose and walked to the back of a Hutong. He looked around and started to make notes of the surroundings. He also took out his camera to take a few pictures. There were still a few people who refused to move. There were 3 old men and one old lady. They were sitting in a courtyard, chatting. When they saw Dong Xuebing taking pictures, they immediately surrounded him.\u201cYoung man, are you a reporter?\u201d The old lady looked at Dong Xuebing\u2019s camera.One of the old men said excitedly: \u201cMr. Reporter, you must expose them. They are all hooligans. They even threw bricks at our house in the middle of the night. Even our windows and doors are damaged. They even threaten s that if we still do not move out, they will go bad things to us. This\u2026\u2026 This is against the law.\u201dDong Xuebing closes his notebook. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir, I am not a reporter.\u201dThe old man asked curiously: \u201cThen why are you taking pictures?\u201dDong Xuebing explained: \u201cI am an art student. These pictures are for me to bring back as reference.\u201dThe old men and woman heard this and walked back disappointedly.Dong Xuebing just smile and continue walking around, taking notes. Because he was not writing the formal report, the only jolts down points. He wanted to finish his job and make a trip to Panjiayuen or Shilihe\u2019s antique markets. He wants to see if he could get any lucky finds there. Now, Dong Xuebing total wealth was only slightly more than 100,000 RMB. It was still far from his 1 million RMB target.Noon, Dong Xuebing went to a small restaurant opposite to have his lunch.He thought if he should follow an expert later at Panjiayuen. He could use BACK to be one step faster than the expert. Sighed\u2026\u2026. But there were not many experts around. Furthermore, the items picked by the experts might not be an authentic antique too. What should he do? Walnuts gamble again? But he will not be so lucky every time. If he only waited for someone to open a walnut fruit and use BACK to snatch it, it will be a waste. Even if he could use BACK twice and got a pair of 45 mm Lion Head, he can only sell it for a few thousand RMB. How long will he take to reach 1 million? Also, there should not be many walnut fruits this season. Even if he wants to gamble, he will have to wait until next year!Dong Xuebing had a headache. Even with the power BACK, it was also tough to make money!Dong Xuebing returned to the residential estate and looked at the half-demolished building. Dong Xuebing was thinking about how to make money and taking pictures at the same time. Where should he go to make money? He was not hoping to find a Yuen dynasty porcelain vase or a Xuande Burner. He only wants something that will let him earn 100,000 RMB! Sighed\u2026\u2026 Where can I find treasures?Just when Dong Xuebing was still daydreaming, he heard someone shouting at him from behind.\u201cHey, hey! What are you doing?\u201d Dong Xuebing turned and saw a middle age man.Dong Xuebing took a picture and frowned: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? Stop taking pictures!\u201d\u201cI am taking my pictures, did I bother you?\u201dThere were some workers carrying bricks behind the middle age man. From his attitude, he should be the supervisor of the workers. The middle age man stepped forward and tried to snatch Dong Xuebing\u2019s camera. \u201cThis is our work site. Have you asked for our permission?\u201d The man thought Dong Xuebign was a reporter. He had received orders from his higher-ups to not let reporters report on their work site and have negative news. This was why this man was so insistent.Dong Xuebing dodged and asked with a long face. \u201cThis land belongs to the nation. Since when did this place belong to you?\u201dThe man stared at Dong Xuebing furiously. \u201cShut up! Give me that camera!\u201d\u201cI need to be clear to you first. I am not a reporter. I am taking pictures for me to draw.\u201d Dong Xuebing argued and quickly keep the camera. He looked at him in his eyes. \u201cWhy did you try to snatch my things without asking first? Are you a thief? I can't be bothered with you! Where is the person in charge? Ask the person in charge to come out!\u201d Dong Xuebing was used to ordering people around these two days and had no problems saying all those words.The middle age man laughed. \u201cOh? You sure can talk big. You want to find the leader? I am the leader here!\u201d He said and moved forward to try to snatch Dong Xuebing\u2019s bag. \u201cGive me the camera!\u201d\u201cStop it!\u201dAt this moment, a few workers who were working beside a collapsed wall and bricks suddenly shouted. One of them threw his spade and kneel on the floor to dig the ground with his hands. He dug out a battered wooden box cover.The middle age supervisor asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dA worker with northeast accent shouted: \u201cIt\u2019s a box. Just now, I dug out a piece of tile, and it was buried underneath. I think there is a treasure in it!\u201dThe supervisor was surprised. \u201cTreasure?!\u201dDong Xuebing was also stunned. He stretched his neck to try to see what the treasure was. But he could not see it clearly.Another northeast accented worker, who was kneeling there said. \u201cThere is a big metal chest in the box. I am not sure what it contains!\u201dBox? Metal chest?The middle age man brightens up. He had been in this line for many years, and he knew that sometimes people will find treasures buried underground. This was not uncommon in the industry. Last year, when he was at a work site in Changchun street, he found two jade pendants buried under a house. He sold the pendants for a large sum of money. The middle age man was overjoyed. Hahaha. It\u2019s my lucky day today. He turned around and stared at Dong Xuebing. He was no longer interested in getting Dong Xuebing\u2019s camera. He shoved Dong Xuebing: \u201cOk, ok! Hurry up and get lost!\u201dYou want to chase me away now?Fat hopes!After Dong Xuebing saw the wooden box, his eyes also brighten up. \u201cBACK!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime returned to one minute ago.\u201cShut up! Give me that camera!\u201d The supervisor rushed forward to snatch the camera.When Dong Xuebing did not use BACK in the day, he will practice using it before he sleeps. After practicing for almost a hundred times, he was now used to the uncomfortableness of scenes changing. It took only a blink of an eye for Dong Xuebing to recover. He looked at the supervisor coldly and dodged. He immediately shouted to the few workers who were digging the floor tiles behind the supervisor. \u201cStop digging! Stop! Stop whatever you are doing!\u201d As Dong Xuebing was shouting to them, he was thinking of a plan. That box was buried under the tiles, and there was no reason the box did not contain any treasure. This was a rare opportunity. But how can I get that box? These people were about to discover the box! Dong Xuebing must think of a way!The few workers stopped and looked at Dong Xuebing,\u201cWho do you think you are to ask them to stop?\u201d The supervisor turned and shouted: \u201cCarry on with your work!\u201dThe workers looked at each other and carried on using their shovels to lift the tiles.That grey stone tile was about to be lifted. Dong Xuebing was anxious and loses focus slightly. The supervisor took this opportunity to snatch the camera from Dong Xuebing. The supervisor tried to delete all the photographs, and Dong Xuebing shout furiously: \u201cYou are asking for it!\u201d He suddenly got an idea. He reached into his bag and took out his new work pass and waved it in front of the supervisor. \u201cDo you know how to read? Look at this with your own eyes!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The supervisor was about to delete the pictures when he looked up.It was a black leather card holder. The size was about the same as a driving license. A silver national emblem with the words \u201cPolice,\u201d in both English and Mandarin, was printed on the cover. The work pass had Dong Xuebing\u2019s photo, his name, and his appointment. Beijing City State Security Western District Branch Bureau, General Affairs Office Deputy Chief. Of course, Dong Xuebing covered his personal details with his fingers as he held up his pass. He only showed the words \u201cState Security\u201d and \u201cDeputy Chief.\u201dThe supervisor was stunned: \u201cState Security?\u201dDong Xuebing pointed to those workers who were trying to lift up the stone floor tile. \u201cStop working!\u201dThe workers were afraid that the Supervisor would scold them, and they ignored Dong Xuebing\u2019s orders.The middle age supervisor recovered from his shock and quickly shouted: \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what the officer said? Stop whatever you are doing now!\u201d\u201cOfficer?\u201d The workers were confused. Their supervisor was still trying to snatch that young man\u2019s camera, and the next moment, he was calling him an officer? But all of them obeyed and stop working. They dropped their tools. Bang! The stone tile which was lifted about 30 degrees fell back on the ground.The supervisor rubbed his palms embarrassedly and smiled: \u201cSir, I\u2019m very sorry. I thought you are a reporter.\u201dDong Xuebing was relieved that he had gotten control of the situation, and he remembered the supervisor\u2019s rude attitude towards him earlier. He was pissed. He did not care if the supervisor was more than 20 years older than him and started scolding him: \u201cReporter? Can\u2019t you use your brains?! If I am a reporter, will I be taking pictures in front of you? Ah? Also, what\u2019s wrong with reporters? You are allowed to snatch a reporter\u2019s personal belongings? We are living in a law-abiding society! Do you know what you have done is against the law? Ah? Who do you think you are?!\u201dThe supervisor replied with a sullen face: \u201cNo, no\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201dDong Xuebing continued scolding for a while. \u201c\u2026\u2026 Camera!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Here\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d The supervisor quickly returned the digital camera back to Dong Xuebing. He knew the State Security had the most authority. He could not afford to offend anyone from this agency, especially the leaders there. He did not even try to retort or argue. He only wishes Dong Xuebing would leave this place. He did not want to be invited to the bureau for \u201ctea.\u201dBut Dong Xuebing had no intentions of leaving.Dong Xuebing brushed off the dust on his clothes and walked over to the workers. \u201cTake a break first. I have some questions for you all.\u201dThe supervisor who was following behind stared at the workers: \u201cAnswer this officer\u2019s questions truthfully. Do you all understand?\u201d He was trembling inside. A State Security Officer was here\u2026\u2026. Was he here to investigate a case or was he here to investigate about me? This should not be. I only harvested some stubborn residents who refused to move out. I did not do anything that compromises national security!The workers looked at Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing cleared his throat. \u201cHave you all seen a tall man with a dark complexion in his forties around here?\u201dEveryone shook their heads.The supervisor was relieved when he know that he was not the one who was being investigated. \u201cThink carefully!\u201dThe workers shook their head again. \u201cWe can\u2019t remember.\u201dDong Xuebing continued to pretend: \u201cHe is about 1.9 m tall and have short hair.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d The worker with the northeast accent replied: \u201cWe were focusing on doing our work every day and did not notice anyone around here.\u201dThe supervisor also added: \u201cSir, I also did not see this person around here. Did he commit any serious crime?\u201d Dong Xuebing ignored him, and that supervisor smiled embarrassedly. \u201cSorry\u2026\u2026 sorry\u2026.. I should not be asking.\u201dDong Xuebing looked at the condition of the floor tiles from the corner of his eyes and moved one step forward. He stopped directly on that stone floor tile. \u201cOk. All of you carry on with your work. Don\u2019t tell anyone about what I said to you.\u201dThe Supervisor quickly replied: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will not say anything!\u201dDong Xuebing nodded and took out his notebook to continue taking down notes for his proposal.The supervisor looked at Dong Xuebing and wonder why this State Security officer was not leaving? What was he writing? He asked cautiously: \u201cSir, they are still working, and it is very dusty here. Your clothes will be dirtied.\u201dDong Xuebing did not lift up his head and replied. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I will stay here.\u201dThe supervisor smiled and looked at his workers. He gestured to them to carry on with their work.A worker took a spade and looked at the stone tile Dong Xuebing was standing on. He opened his mouth and was about to say something when another worker quickly dragged him away. The workers went to work on another part of the house. They continued to demolish the house.An hour passed, and Dong Xuebing was still standing there.Two hours passed. Dong Xuebing still did not leave.Three hours was gone, and Dong Xuebing was still there.It was dark, and the supervisor and the workers packed up and left with their tools. Dong Xuebing\u2019s stomach was growling, and his legs and back were aching. He looked around and made sure those workers would not return before removing his feet from the stone floor tile. He quickly ran to a toilet before having dinner at a nearby restaurant.The opportunity to get rich was here!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you still not back yet?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 Aunt Xuan. I am still busy with work. I will be back late today.\u201d\u201cOk. Then I will not wait for you for dinner. Don\u2019t come back too late and watch out for your own safety.\u201d\u201cOk. I will take care of myself.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Dong Xuebing kept his iPhone4 in his pocket. He finished the last bite of his dinner. There were still people walking around the demolition site, and he had to wait. He continued to write the draft proposal for Xu Yan which was due tomorrow. When he completed the proposal, it was almost 8 pm. It was dark, and there were no one around.It\u2019s time!Dong Xuebing steadied himself and walked out of the small restaurant.The dimmed street lights illuminated that messy demolition site. This was only the initial phase of the demolition, and there was no heavy machinery. Thus, there were no security guards around. Other than two stray grey cats and a stray dog, there was no one else. It was night, and this place was messy and dirty. No one will come here. Dong Xuebing looked at the stone floor tile. He returned to the spot where he stood for hours in the afternoon. The stone tile was still in the same position before he left.Time to start digging!Dong Xuebing rolled up his sleeves and squat down. He used his fingers to hook onto the cold and heavy tile. He braced himself and start to pry the tile open. This tile was too heavy. In the afternoon, he saw a few workers working together to remove one stone tile.A bit more! More strength! Just a little bit more!The stone tile moved. It was slowly rising as Dong Xuebing uses all his strength.10 cm\u2026\u2026 20 cm\u2026\u2026 Bang! The stone tiled was flipped over.Dong Xuebing quickly look around to see if anyone notice the loud sound. He was relieved and patted the dust off his hands. He leans forward excitedly to look at what was buried underneath the tile. It was a box. The box was covered in dirt and was worn out. Dong Xuebing swiped the dirt away and pried opened the wooden box. There was a rusty metal box wrapped in a thick plastic sheet in the box. From the condition of the box, it should not be buried too long ago.What was in this box?It will be a waste of BACK if this box contains something worthless!Dong Xuebing grumbled for a while and unwrap the metal box from the thick plastic sheet. He held the box in his hand, and his heart skipped a beat. Damn! This box was too light. It only weighs about two to three teacups. He shook the box, and there was no sound. That means the box does not contain any gold, silver, or porcelain items. Dong Xuebing was disappointed. He placed the box on the floor.The weight of this box feels like it was filled with papers.Damn. Don\u2019t tell me that some kid had buried his diary or newspaper under the floor tile! That will be a joke!Dong Xuebing rubbed his cold fingers and put them near his mouth to warm them. Then he starts to open the metal box. Click! He removed the rusty lid of the box. From the dim lighting, Dong Xuebing saw what was inside. Fuck! Dong Xuebing slapped his forehead.There were more than a dozen small books in the box and nothing else!It was too dim, and Dong Xuebing could not see the books clearly. But unless the book pages were made from gold, how much can he sell these old books for? 1 RMB? 2 RMB? This should be what those garbage collectors will pay for books. Damn! Wasted the whole afternoon and today\u2019s BACK. Dong Xuebing shook his head and walked over to the lamppost with the metal box. He had spent so much time and effort to get this box, he wants to see what was written in the books.The street lights shone on the box.Dong Xuebing did not think much about the books. He took out one book from the box.When he took a closer look at the book, he was stunned for a few seconds!Wait! Wait a minute!The title of the book was\u2026\u2026 ? The famous Song dynasty block-printed ?Dong Xuebing quickly took out the other small books from the box. Jiaqing block-printed ? Qing Dynasty Kangxi block-printed ? Lu You\u2019s ? Li Zhongshi\u2019s ? The last book was a scripture from the Tang Dynasty\u2026\u2026 ?!Damn!These were not worthless books. These were all classic books!!!Dong Xuebing had worked part-time in an antique shop that specialized in old books and antique four treasures for two months. He knew the value of these books. He was speechless. This was terrific! He immediately took out all the books and kept them carefully in his bag. He checked the time and went back to return the stone tile back to its original position. After that, he flagged a cab and rushed to Panjiayuan.The antique market at Panjiayuan closes early. Dong Xuebing was going to an antique shop just across the street from Panjiayuan.Last summer holidays, Dong Xuebing had sold antique books at this shop.The taxi stopped, and Dong Xuebing alighted. The lights in the shop were mostly off except for a small light. He quickly walked to the wooden door and knocked on it. \u201cBoss Jia, Boss Jia\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t close so early. I am Xiao Dong.\u201dCreak\u2026\u2026 A middle-aged man with a mustache opens the door. \u201cXiao Dong? Why are you here?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled and asked. \u201cCan I speak to you inside? It is not convenient here.\u201dBoss Jia laughed. \u201cSure. But my business is not good this year, and I have no intentions of hiring.\u201d\u201cIt is not about hiring.\u201d Dong Xuebing stepped into the shop, and there was a strong scent of books.Boss Jia switched on the lights again. \u201cIf you are minutes later, I would have locked the door and went to bed. What\u2019s the matter? Why are you so secretive?\u201dDong Xuebing was close to Boss Jia and did not stand on ceremony. He sat on a Qing Dynasty replica official chair and wiped the water stains on the table before taking out all the antique books from his bag. \u201cI am here to sell you these. Errr\u2026\u2026 I am short of cash recently, and these are all my family\u2019s collection. Name me a price.\u201dBoss Jia stroked his mustache. \u201cAntique books?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Dong Xuebing picked a few books and placed it on the table.\u201cHohoho\u2026\u2026 You kept all the good stuff for yourself. You should have shown me this good stuff in the past. Com, show me what you have there.\u201d Boss Jia wore his spectacles and sat beside Dong Xuebing. He picked up one of the books on the table and start to examine it. \u201cWow\u2026\u2026 ? These are 4 are Qing Dynasty blocked printed books? These are good stuff.\u201d\u201cHow much is it worth?\u201d Antique books were different from other antiques. Because of the high production cost, there were very few fakes around. This was why Dong Xuebing asked for the value straight.Boss Jia stroked his mustache again. \u201cHmmm\u2026. it is still in good condition. It should be worth about 4,000 RMB. Eh? Why is the book damp?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 It must be I had kept it in a box at home for too long and did not bring it out to air it.\u201d\u201cOk. What else do you have? Let me see.\u201dDong Xuebing took every out and placed it on the table. \u201cGive me a good price for all these. If your offer is too low, I will not sell it. Hahaha.\u201dBoss Jia laughed. \u201cYou brat. Since you are the one selling these books, I will surely give you a good price.\u201dDong Xuebing did not believe him. Which businessman is not interested in making more profits? But he knew Boss Jia for quite some time, and he knew Boss Jia will not lowball him.Boss Jia starts to examine the books. \u201cOh\u2026\u2026 This have some missing chapters and pages. The condition is also not very good. Look at this corner. It is damaged by insects. This book is not worth a lot. 800 RMB? At most, it\u2019s worth about 1,000 RMB\u2026\u2026 Wow\u2026\u2026 This is a Song Dynasty block-printed book? ? This is good. Although there is only one chapter, the Song Dynasty block printed books are rare. This should fetch about 6,000 RMB\u2026\u2026. ? I will offer 5,000 RMB for this\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Xuebing was calculating the total in his heart.At last, Boss Jia looked at the last book. When he opened it up, he took in a deep breath. \u201cTang Dynasty scripture\u2026\u2026 ?\u201d He looked at Dong Xuebing in shocked. \u201cYou have kept this book in mint condition. This is great. Where did you get this from? Your family\u2019s heirloom?\u201dDong Xuebing smiles. \u201cI am also not sure.\u201dBoss Jia sees that Dong Xuebing was not willing to tell him, and he did not continue to ask him. He sighed. \u201cThis Tang Scripture\u2026\u2026 I will offer you 80,000 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing also knew a bit about antique books. He knows should worth more than this. \u201c100,000 RMB.\u201dBoss Jia shook his head. \u201cI cannot offer 100,000 RMB. That\u2019s the auction price.\u201dDong Xuebing starts to bargain. \u201c80,000 RMB is too low. How about this? I will not bargain for the rest of the books and follow whatever prices you set. But you have to give me a bit more for this Tang Scripture.\u201dBoss Jia thought for a while and said. \u201c90,000 RMB is the highest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ok! Deal!\u201d\u201cCash?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cWait a while. I will go and get the cash.\u201dThese few books were sold for more than 110,000 RMB!With Dong Xuebing\u2019s savings of about 100,000 RMB, his total assets had reached 220,000 RMB!This was an amount Dong Xuebing did not even dare to dream about!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFriday.Dong Xuebing was still sleeping when his mother\u2019s phone call woke him up. \u201cHello? Mum?\u201d\u201cYou are still sleeping? How are you doing recently? Are you use for your work? Did your leader pick on you?\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother was anxious about her son. Her son had finally started working and was afraid that he will get into trouble with his leaders.Pick on me? I am the one picking on others now! Dong Xuebing yawned and rubbed his eyes. He sat up and looked at the time. \u201cEverything is all fine. I had called you that day, but you are not in school. Hahaha, when are you coming back to Beijing? I have something to tell you. Are you coming back for New Year?\u201d\u201cWe have classes on New Year too. I have to wait until Lunar New year.\u201d Dong Xuebing\u2019s mother replied. \u201cWhat good news do you have for me? You have a girlfriend?\u201dDong Xuebing coughed. \u201cNot yet. Errr\u2026.. I will tell you when you are back. It is only less than 2 months to Lunar New Year. I want to give you a surprise.\u201d Dong Xuebing had been promoted to Deputy Chief and made some money. He wants to keep it from his mother and give her a surprise when she comes back. \u201cOh, do you still have money? I will remit some money to you later?\u201d\u201cNo need. I still have the money you sent me last time.\u201d\u201cHuh? You haven\u2019t finished using it? Didn\u2019t I ask you to use it?\u201d\u201cStop talking nonsense. How can you spend all your money? Don\u2019t spend all your salary!\u201d\u201cI am only asking you to spend more money on yourself. Don\u2019t keep scrimping.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. We have lodging and food here. We do not need to spend much. I will save money for you. You still need to get married in the future. Ok. The telephone charges are high, and I got to go back to class. Bye.\u201d If the call were more than 1 minute, Dong Xuebing would be charged for the second minute. His mother did not wait for her son to say anything and hang up on the 59th second.At work.Dong Xuebing submitted the relocation proposal to Li Qing and Xu Yan. This proposal was very detailed. There were also pictures included in the proposal. Xu Yan was quite satisfied with this proposal and gave him another task. Dong Xuebing was not worried about having more work. In fact, he needs more work to prove his capabilities. He needs to show others that he was able to take on the role of Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office. So, before the end of the day, Dong Xuebing completed the task given to him that day.Dong Xuebing\u2019s career was on track. He only needs more experience.His finances were also sound. Money had been going into his account, and he had enough to buy his mother a house in her hometown.Dong Xuebing had 3 goals in his life. Be a Government Official, make money, and get a wife. Now, his only regret was with his relationship.That evening, Dong Xuebing decided to woo Aunt Xuan while on his way home. After alighting from the bus, he went to the supermarket nearby to buy lots of groceries. On his way back home, he called Qu Yunxuan. \u201cHello? Aunt Xuan? Have you reached home? I will cook dinner tonight?\u201dA gentle voice replied: \u201cXiao Bing, I need to work overtime today and will be back later.\u201d\u201cOh, no worries. I will prepare dinner and wait for you to get back.\u201dQu Yunxuan\u2019s background was noisy. Many people were talking. \u201cNo need. I still don\u2019t know what time I will be back. I might have to stay here until 8 to 9 pm.\u201d Qu Yunxuan held the phone away from her and said to someone. \u201cXiao Zhao, that is for the editor. You all help to edit it first.\u201d She finishes saying and then told Dong Xuebing. \u201cXiao Bing, I am quite busy. Don\u2019t wait for me. Take your dinner yourself. I will grab something to eat when I am back.\u201dDong Xuebing could only agree. \u201cOk.\u201dAlthough Dong Xuebing agreed to not wait for her, he did not want to have dinner without her. He used his spare key and enter Aunt Qu\u2019s unit. The living room was filled with a woman\u2019s scent, and Dong Xuebing stood there inhaling this heavenly smell for a few seconds. After that, he went to the kitchen. Aunt Xuan was someone who loves cleanliness. Her apartment was spotless. The kitchen which was usually the messiest for most people were neat and tidy. Dong Xuebing start to prepare their ingredients. After that, he sat on a stool and lean back on the kitchen cabinet to think about his plan to woo Qu Yunxuan.He kept thinking\u2026\u2026He waited and waited\u2026..Maybe it was because Dong Xuebing got too excited and did not sleep well last night, he dozed off on the stool. When Dong Xuebing opened up his eyes, it was already dark. His back was aching from the uncomfortable position. He took out his iPhone 4 and looked at the time. It was 7.55pm. Aunt Xuan was not back yet? Dong Xuebing touched his growling stomach and walked out of the dark kitchen. The lights in the apartment were not on. It was dark. He slowly makes his way to the living room as he wanted to watch some TV as he waited for Qu Yunxuan to return. But when he reaches out for the TV remote, he noticed Qu Yunxuan\u2019s handbag on the sofa.Eh? Dong Xuebing did not remember seeing this handbag just now.He looked towards the bedroom and could see lights in the bedroom from the partially closed door!Aunt Xuan was home? She did not go to the kitchen and did not see me?Dong Xuebing laughed to himself. Who would expect him to fall asleep in the kitchen? He also did not know that Aunt Xuan had returned home. He walked over to the bedroom and was about to call her. The words were in his mouth, but he could not call her.Dong Xuebing saw something that made him blushed, and his heart racing!The door crack was about the width of 4 fingers, and Dong Xuebing could hear the sounds of someone breathing heavily. It sounds like someone having an asthma attack. The breathing was rapid and seemed like she was in agony. The computer monitor was playing a movie. From Dong Xuebing\u2019s angle, he could not see what the movie was. He could only see the website name in the corner of the monitor. Qu Yunxuan, in her white blouse and jeans, was squatting on the chair with her high heels on, in front of the monitor. Yes, she was squatting on the chair. She seems to be biting her fingers and another hand on her legs from Dong Xuebing\u2019s angle. Because of the backrest of the chair, Dong Xuebing could not see most of Aunt Xuan\u2019s body. He could only see that Qu Yunxuan only had her left leg in her jeans. She was shaking and her right leg, which was still in skinned colored stockings and black heels, was exposed.Damn! What was Aunt Xuan doing?Dong Xuebing had never seen anything like this before in his life. He was stunned!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayVirtuous, virtuous, and virtuous!This was the only word Dong Xuebing could use to describe Qu Yunxuan.Aunt Xuan was a gentle woman, and to Dong Xuebing, she had no flaws. She had a beautiful face and a perfect hourglass figure. She had class, educated, elegant, kind, gentle to others, etc. She was his perfect woman. So, when Dong Xuebing saw Qu Yunxuan squatting on the chair doing \u2018that\u2019 to herself, he could not believe his eyes. Was this really Aunt Xuan? How can this person be Aunt Xuan?!It\u2019s too\u2026\u2026!Dong Xuebing held his breath. He was afraid that Aunt Xuan would notice him.The half squatting Qu Yunxuan was leaning slightly against the backrest. Her messy black long hair was covering her back and shoulders. Her breathing was getting faster, and soft moaning could be heard. She quickly took out her finger in her mouth and lower it in between her legs. She then sucks her fingers on the other hand. Under the dimmed lights, Dong Xuebing could see her fair skin turning slightly red.Oh my god!!!! Does Aunt Xuan do this every day?This is too hard to accept!!!!Dong Xuebing heart was beating very fast, and his throat was parched. He strained his eyes, trying to see more of Qu Yunxuan. But she was back facing him, and he could not see much. Damn! Dong Xuebing, what are you waiting for? You must think of a way to leave without her noticing. When Aunt Xuan finishes whatever she was doing and sees you in her house, there was no way you can explain yourself. Tell her that you fell asleep in the kitchen? Who would believe you?! Aunt Xuan will surely feel uncomfortable, and the chances of capturing her heart would be slim!Dong Xuebing broke out in cold sweat when he thought about the consequences. This was not the time to peep. He must leave!Dong Xuebing took one last look at Qu Yunxuan\u2019s sexy thighs and turned quietly. He tip-toed to the main door. The door lock was the old type, and if he unlocks it, there will be a click sound. Errr\u2026\u2026 even if Aunt Xuan was doing \u2018that,\u2019 she will surely hear the sound of him unlocking the door. Dong Xuebing knew Aunt Xuan was about to finish whatever she was doing, and he suddenly thought of an idea.He reaches out for the door lock and unlocks it. Click! He quickly opens the door and stepped on the ground a few times. Then took out his keys from his pocket. He shook it a few times and closes the door. He turned around to face the living room, pretending he had just opened the door with his keys and entered the unit.Dong Xuebing hopes he would be able to fool Qu Yunxuan, but the sounds he made caused chaos in the bedroom!Crash! The chair fell on the floor!Dong! It sounded like a high heel shoe had fallen on to the ground!\u201cWho is it?! Xiao Dong?!\u201dDong Xuebing pretended to not know anything: \u201cAh, Aunt Xuan. You are at home? I thought you are not back yet.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come in first. Wait outside for a while. Wait there.\u201d Qu Yunxuan might have fallen from the chair, and she sounded like she was in pain. Click, click, click\u2026\u2026 it was the sounds of high heel shoes and the sound of a belt buckle. The bedroom door was also closed suddenly. \u201cI have just returned home, and I am changing.\u201d\u201cHuh? Sorry. I don\u2019t know. You want me to go back first?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 err\u2026\u2026. Wait for a while. I will be ready soon.\u201dDong Xuebing took a deep breath and slapped himself in his face to calm himself down. He must not let Aunt Xuan knows he was lying.After about 5 to 6 minutes, Qu Yunxuan, whose neck was still red, walked out from the bedroom. She was still wearing the same jeans Dong Xuebing saw earlier, but she changed her blouse to a cotton t-shirt. \u201cHahaha, I have too many clothes and don\u2019t know what to wear.\u201d Aunt Xuan returned back to her usual virtuous self. She was totally different from that sultry self earlier.Dong Xuebing coughed. \u201cHave you taken your dinner?\u201d\u201cI have just returned home.\u201d\u201cI still have not eaten dinner too. I will go and prepare dinner now.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I ask you not to wait for me? Why can't you listen to me?\u201d Qu Yunxuan stared at him with an angry expression. \u201cI will go and prepare dinner. Stay here and wait.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cI have prepared the ingredients. I only need to fry them. You have just come back. Take a rest first. I will do the cooking.\u201d\u201cYou ah\u2026.\u201d Qu Yunxuan laughed and used her fingers to flick Dong Xuebing\u2019s nose like usual.The earlier image which was burned into Dong Xuebing\u2019s mind reappeared. He could feel his temperature rising, and he took in a deep breath to smell her fingers. Her finger was still slightly damp, and there was a strong weird smell.Qu Yunxuan might have suddenly remembered something and quickly retract her hand. She immediately uses her sleeves to wipe Dong Xuebing\u2019s nose. While wiping, she blushed and explained. \u201cI had forgotten that while changing just now, I saw some dirt in my wardrobe and I wiped it with a damp cloth. I did not even wash my hands yet. Xiao Bing, you\u2026\u2026. Go and wash your face now. Hurry up. My hand is dirty.\u201d Wow, Aunt Xuan also knows how to lie.Dong Xuebing touched his nose, and his heart was beating fast. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026. There\u2019s no need for me to wash.\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at his nose, and she blushed. \u201cOk. Then\u2026\u2026 I will go and wash my hands. I am looking forward to trying your cooking.\u201d\u201cOk. I believe you will like it.\u201dDong Xuebing waited until Aunt Xuan enters the bathroom before going into the kitchen to cook dinner.Just when the oil in the wok was heated, and spring onions and ginger were added, Qu Yunxuan entered the kitchen with a wet face towel. She used the cloth to wiped Dong Xuebing\u2019s face and laughed. \u201cYou should clean your face. I had used that rag to clean everything. It\u2019s dirty and smelly. It will not feel good if the smell lingers on your nose.\u201dDong Xuebing laughed and thanked her.Qu Yunxuan wiped his face more than a dozen times.: \u201cYou carry on with the cooking. I will go and wash clothes now. I still have not washed your two pairs of socks. Hahaha, your socks really stink. Don\u2019t wear the socks until it stinks before letting me wash. Pass it to me once it is dirty. I need to soak it in detergent longer.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Dong Xuebing replied embarrassedly. \u201cI will call you when dinner is ready.\u201dDong Xuebing looked at Qu Yunxuan as she walks out of the kitchen. He was staring at her tight jeans. Today he had seen an unknown side of Aunt Xuan. He was feeling complicated. He was shocked, surprised, awkward, excited\u2026\u2026 Was Aunt Xuan someone who was demure on the outside and wild in bed?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHehe, our Xiao Bing can cook well.\u201d\u201cTry this shredded meat. See if it tastes good.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026. It smells nice. It\u2019s delicious.\u201dDong Xuebing had forgotten about what he saw in the bedroom earlier. He was now focused on getting Qu Yunxuan\u2019s affection. Aunt Xuan was so lonely to the extent she got to resort to doing \u2018that\u2019 to herself. But he cannot let other guys take advantage of her. He wants to capture her heart in the shortest time possible. So, Dong Xuebing did not let Qu Yunxuan wash the dishes after dinner. He washes all the dishes and scrubbed the kitchen clean. He hopes his performance today will add some points. Of course, Dong Xuebing knew this was not enough. He still needs to do more.8 plus.Dong Xuebing and Qu Yunxuan were in the living room, sending songs to each other\u2019s iPhone 4.Dong Xuebing tried to start a conversation: \u201cWhat are you working late almost every day recently? Will you be back late tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI will be off for tomorrow and the day after that.\u201d Qu Yunxuan was still swiping her phone. She smiled: \u201cActually I did not work until very late today. I had left around 30 minutes later, but a leader in my newspaper agency wants to introduce his brother to me. He told me that his brother is still single and wants us to meet. I have to give my leader's face. So, I met up with his brother and had a short chat in a caf\u00e9 nearby.\u201dLeader\u2019s brother? Introduce to her? Damn!Dong Xuebing felt threaten. He immediately asks. \u201cHow is that man?\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026.. How do I put it?\u201d Dong Xuebing had confessed to Qu Yunxuan twice and held her hands once. But he used BACK on both occasions. So, Qu Yunxuan still does not know Dong Xuebing likes her. If not, she will not talk to him about her blind date. \u201cThat man is alright. His looks, physique, career are all considered above average. But\u2026\u2026\u201d Qu Yunxuan shook her head. \u201cHe is not my type. Also, I do not want to date anyone for the time being.\u201dDong Xuebing was relieved and asked: \u201cThen what type of men do you like?\u201dQu Yunxuan laughed and crossed her legs. \u201cI also can\u2019t tell you what type of men do I like. But he must be someone who is clean cut and meticulous. For example, he should buy me a bouquet of flowers when he finishes work. This will let me feel\u2026\u2026 If possible, I also hope my boyfriend will be caring for me. Look.\u201d She looked towards her handbag on the sofa. \u201cMy handbag was accidentally torn last week on the bus. I have been busy these few days and did not have the time to get a new handbag. My scarf was also slightly torn the other day when it was hooked onto the door lock. I can still use it, though. My handphone accessories too. My Chinese knot accessory is dirtied. No matter how I wash it, I can\u2019t remove the stain. Haha, if there is someone who can give me a new handbag or a new scarf or handphone accessory, I will feel\u2026\u2026. Warm. The items do not need to be expensive. It will just let me know that he cares for me. If someone really cares about me like this, I might\u2026\u2026\u201dMight what? Dong Xuebing really wanted to know.I am together with Aunt Xuan almost every day, and even I did not notice her handbag had a small tear. I didn\u2019t even know that her scarf was torn. I didn\u2019t even see her handphone accessory have a stain. Dong Xuebing looked at her handbag. He looked at it for a long time and finally found the tear. But the tear was too small. Even if he picked up the handbag and examine it, he might also not see it! He then looked at the Chinese knot handphone accessory. It was only a tiny black dot.God damn! Aunt Xuan! How meticulous do you want your boyfriend to be?Qu Yunxuan looked at the speechless expression on Dong Xuebing\u2019s face, and she knocked his head. \u201cAre you laughing at me in your heart?\u201d\u201cCoughed. No, no.\u201d Dong Xuebing laughed. \u201cMeticulous man is good.\u201d\u201cI know my expectations are a bit high. This type of man does not exist. This is also why I have not dated before. No matter how successful a man is, he is still not up to my expectations. Sigh\u2026\u2026 Nevermind. Maybe one day, my dream man will appear before me suddenly.\u201dDong Xuebing asked jealously: \u201cIf he suddenly appears, what will you do?\u201d\u201cHaha, then I will grab hold to him and never let go.\u201dDong Xuebing wanted to knock some sense into her. You said your expectations are not high, but your expectations are ridiculously high. Where can you find such a person in this world? You are just finding\u2026.. Eh? Wait! Wait a minute! Dong Xuebing opened his eyes wide and stood up. This type of man does exist. Why can't he exist?! Damn! I still have not used my BACK power today!\u201cBACK!\u201d\u2026\u2026The time was reversed!Dong Xuebing eyes blurred, and the next moment, he could feel the soft cushion of the sofa. He was now sitting on the sofa.Qu Yunxuan touched her hair and said: \u201c\u201cI also can\u2019t tell you what type of men do I like. But\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Dong Xuebing interrupted her. \u201cWhat did I say just now?\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at him weirdly. \u201cYou asked me what type of man I like. I can\u2019t really tell you, but I like\u2026\u2026\u201dThis was the time before Aunt Xuan told him her expectations!Dong Xuebing quickly stop her. \u201cNevermind. You don\u2019t really need to tell me that. Errr\u2026\u2026 I still have something on and need to go back.\u201dQu Yunxuan blinked her eyes and replied. \u201cActually, there is not much to say anyway. I should not be able to meet the man I like in my whole lifetime. If I tell you my expectations, you will laugh at me. Haha. Ok. Rest early. You should be tired from work these few days.\u201dAfter leaving Qu Yunxuan\u2019s house, Dong Xuebing did not return home immediately. He went downstairs and took a taxi to the nearest shopping mall. It was still 8 plus in the evenings, and the malls were not close. When Dong Xuebing returns, it was almost 9.20 pm. He was carrying a big plastic shopping bag, and he went to knock on Aunt Xuan\u2019s door. Aunt Xuan had changed to her pajamas, and her hair and face were wet. She should be washing up and preparing to go to bed.Qu Yunxuan opened the door and let him in. \u201cWhy are you not sleeping? What did you buy?\u201d\u201cAunt Xuan, come over here.\u201d Dong Xuebing placed the shopping bag on the coffee table.Qu Yunxuan walked over and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dDong Xuebing took out a handphone accessory from the bag. It was a Chinese knot. \u201cI bought some things for you. See if you like it.\u201dQu Yunxuan was stunned. \u201cHandphone accessory? You saw the stain on my Chinese knot!?\u201dAfter Dong Xuebing passed the handphone accessory to her, he took out a light colored flowery print scarf. Qu Yunxuan was speechless as Dong Xuebing wrapped the scarf around her neck. Then, Dong Xuebing took out a black ladies handbag and placed it into the stunned Qu Yunxuan\u2019s hands.\u201cHandbag? Handphone accessory? Scarf?\u201d Qu Yunxuan did not know what to say. She had not told anyone about her bag being scratched and was torn. She will also try to cover it with her hands or scarf when she carries the bag. She was going to buy a new bag when she was free. She does not know how come Dong Xuebing was able to notice this small detail. Qu Yunxuan carried the bag and touched the scarf on her neck in silent.Dong Xuebing asked. \u201cDo you like the color?\u201dQu Yunxuan paused for a while before replying: \u201cThank you, Xiao Bing. Thank you.\u201dDong Xuebing smiled embarrassedly: \u201cWhat\u2019s there to thank? The total is less than 300 RMB.\u201d Dong Xuebing was in a rush and did not have the time to choose the items.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money. I did not expect this\u2026\u2026 really\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026 I really don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Qu Yunxuan held Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm and sat down with him on the sofa. \u201cAh\u2026. I don\u2019t feel tired anymore. Anyway, it\u2019s my rest day tomorrow. Let\u2019s\u2026\u2026 watch a movie together.\u201dBased on Dong Xuebing\u2019s understanding of Qu Yunxuan, he knows she is ecstatic now. If not, she will definitely not accompany him to watch movies.Dong Xuebing brighten up! Success!Aunt Xuan\u2019s affection towards him should increase a lot!!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Yunxuan hugged Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm and watched movies until very late. Dong Xuebing enjoyed this feeling. He felt like he was floating among the clouds, and it seems unreal. Dong Xuebing did not know when he dozes off. He woke up when he turned and fell off the sofa at around midnight. After he realized that he was sleeping in Aunt Xuan\u2019s house, he walked to Aunt Xuan\u2019s room to peep at her. Qu Yunxuan was sleeping and fully clothed. He peeked for a while and returned back to sleep on the sofa.Morning.\u201cXiao Bing, do you want breakfast?\u201dDong Xuebing opened his eyes and saw Qu Yunxuan in an apron. She has placed a bowl of congee on the coffee table. \u201cHuh? What time is it now?\u201d\u201cIt is 9 in the morning. You want to carry on sleeping?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Dong Xuebing got up from the sofa.After putting down the bowl of congee, Qu Yunxuan blew her fingers which was slightly scalded by the hot bowl. \u201cGo and wash up before eating. If you are lazy to go back home to wash up, I have new toothbrush and towel.\u201d It was before 15th of the month, and the central heating had not started. But Aunt Xuan had on her air conditional. The whole apartment was warm. There was no need to wear thermal clothes. Qu Yunxuan removed her apron. She was wearing a white silk slip dress and a pair of skinned colored leggings. Her dressing was sexy and homely.Dong Xuebing\u2019s heart starts to beat faster. That slip dress was very short, and he could see her sexy thighs!\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Qu Yunxuan knocked on his head playfully. \u201cHurry! Go and brush your teeth!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Dong Xuebing quickly took his eyes off her thighs and went into the bathroom.After breakfast, Qu Yunxuan took out her belongings in her old handbag and put them into the new handbag. Then she sat on the sofa and crossed her legs. She was still holding on to her new handbag, admiring it. \u201cXiao Bing, tell me the truth. You must not lie to me. Why are you so caring? Are there any girls after you at your workplace? How is she? Do you like her?\u201dDong Xuebing replied with a pitiful look. \u201cNo. Who would like me?\u201dQu Yunxuan playfully punched his arm and stared at him. \u201cStop saying that. They are the ones who are blind for not liking you. I think you are good enough.\u201d Aunt Xuan picked up the newspaper on the table and started reading it. After reading two pages, she turned to look at Dong Xuebing. \u201cXiao Bing, you are now a Deputy Chief. In the future, there will be lots of girls going after you. But you must choose your girlfriend carefully. You must know which girl really likes you and which girl is after you because of your position. Do you hear me? Don\u2019t rush. If you like any girls, show me first. I will be your gatekeeper.\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026 ok.\u201d I only like you. You can try being the gatekeeper for me.Qu Yunxuan continued reading the newspaper, and Dong Xuebing had anything to do. He switched on the TV to watch the morning news. He watched the news and thought to himself at the same time. After changing his appearance and being caring and meticulous yesterday, his impression in front of Aunt Xuan should have increased. But how much has it improved? It\u2019s too hard to tell. Maybe\u2026\u2026 try holding her hands and see her reaction?That\u2019s right! That should be able to tell!After holding her hands and Dong Xuebing will confess to her the third time! It\u2019s time for Qu Yunxuan to make her decision!Dong Xuebing took in a deep breath while facing the TV. He did not reach out for Qu Yunxuan\u2019s hand immediately. This was because he had failed the last time. That time, Aunt Xuan had brushed his hand off without even thinking. That incident had left a trauma in his heart. He was scared it will happen again. He had thought seriously about that rejection to find out what he did wrong. Dong Xuebing knew the reason he failed the last time was because it was too \u201csudden\u201d and any normal girls will react the same way when someone held their hand suddenly. That action should not reflect whether the girl likes him or not. After all, most girls are shy. What should he do? Why not just grabbed her hand tightly and don\u2019t give her the chance to retract her hand? This might actually work! But will Aunt Xuan be angry if he was so forceful?After hesitating for 5 to 6 minutes, Dong Xuebing gritted his teeth. That\u2019s it! I will hold her hand first and then talk later!Qu Yunxuan was sitting on the sofa quietly reading the newspaper. She was flipping the pages and her fair left hand, which was holding the newspaper, was nearest to Dong Xuebing. Her wrist was resting on her sexy thighs, and her palm was facing upwards. Her little finger was above her skinned colored stockings.Dong Xuebing saw his target, and his palm was positioned. Hmmm\u2026\u2026. From this angle, he should be able to hold her hand. That stupid newspaper she was holding was a hindrance, but it does not matter. At most, he will grab the paper together with her hand. That\u2019s right. Must grab her hand tightly and not let Aunt Xuan have the chance to escape. This was a do or die moment!Dong Xuebing closed his eyes and took a deep breath.3\u2026\u20262\u2026\u20261\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing opened his eyes and turn around suddenly. His hand reach over to the position he anticipated in his mind and grab tightly. \u201cAunt Xuan, I\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Yunxuan turned and looked at him. Her right hand was holding the newspaper, and her left hand was tucking her hair behind her ears. She was shocked.Ah? What happened? Dong Xuebing was stunned. Why was Aunt Xuan\u2019s hand by her ear? Then what was he grabbing? Dong Xuebing looked down and was shocked. Damn!!!! His hand was grabbing Aunt Xuan\u2019s fleshy thighs through her stockings!Grabbed the wrong place!Dong Xuebing had grabbed the wrong part of Qu Yunxuan!\u201cAunt Xuan! It\u2019s not what you think!\u201d God damn! Why did she tuck her hair at this critical moment?!Qu Yunxuan was frozen in place. She was still looking at Dong Xuebing in shock. Maybe she did not expect Dong Xuebing to touch her suddenly.Dong Xuebing almost died from this awkwardness. He knew that there was no way he could explain himself out of this situation. But he remembered that he has the power \u2018BACK\u2019 and was relieved. Luckily, he can still turn back time and save the situation. Dong Xuebing looked where he was touching and suddenly could resist the temptation. He mustered his courage and slowly squeeze Aunt Xuan\u2019s thighs.One squeeze\u2026\u2026Two squeezes\u2026..Dong Xuebing still exclaimed: \u201cAunt Xuan, your leg is slender.\u201dDong Xuebing did not wait for Aunt Xuan to react and quickly shouted BACK in his heart.Huuu\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s over.Dong Xuebing relaxed.The TV was still airing the news, and steam was still rising from the cup of hot tea. Qu Yunxuan was still staring at him. The scenes in front of Dong Xuebing\u2026\u2026 did not change!Ah? What\u2019s happening?Dong Xuebing was shocked. BACK!!It\u2019s still the same!Damn! Oh shit! BACK!!! BACK!!!Suddenly Dong Xuebing remembered that in the wee hours today, he had fallen off the sofa and knocked his head. There was still a bump on his head. He then used BACK to prevent his injury. He had used today\u2019s BACK!?Dong Xuebing could feel cold sweat running down his back as he looked at Qu Yunxuan and his hand on her thigh.Damn!I\u2019m dead!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dong Xuebing could still have Aunt Xuan\u2019s trust. But the stupid Dong Xuebing thought he could still use BACK today and did not remove his hand at the first moment. He even squeezed Qu Yunxuan\u2019s thigh a few times. The worse thing was he still commented on her legs. Damn. How can Dong Xuebing explain himself? There was no way for him to get out of this situation! He couldn\u2019t be telling her that there was a mosquito on her leg and he was helping her to kill the mosquito. That\u2019s bullshit!Dong Xuebing wanted to just kill himself. He had caused a tragedy for himself!Ring, ring, ring\u2026\u2026 The iPhone 4 on the table rang. It was Aunt Xuan\u2019s phone.Dong Xuebing swallowed his saliva. Hee was thinking of a good excuse to explain his actions just now.\u201cHello? Mum?\u201d Qu Yunxuan answered the call.Dong Xuebing dare not to look at Qu Yunxuan. He knows he will be dead when Qu Yunxuan ends this phone call.How long more can he live? 30 seconds? 50 seconds? 60 seconds?\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes, I have eaten\u2026\u2026. I am fine by myself. You don\u2019t need to come over this weekend\u2026\u2026 No need to bring anything. I have everything I need here\u2026\u2026 How are you feeling recently? Oh\u2026\u2026 ok\u2026\u2026. Don\u2019t keep staying at home. If you are free, go out for a walk\u2026\u2026. Yes\u2026.. Ok\u2026.. ok\u2026\u2026 Alright\u2026.. Fine\u2026.. If there is nothing else, I will hang up. Ok\u2026..\u201d A few seconds later, she placed her phone on the coffee table.It was silent.5 seconds\u2026\u202610 seconds\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing knew he cannot feign dead anymore. He turned around and did not know what to say in his current state. \u201cAunt Xuan, your legs\u2026\u2026 how thick is your legs? Your legs seem to be slimmer than mine\u2026\u2026 Hahahaha\u2026\u2026 Errr\u2026\u2026 I just want to see whose legs are slimmer.\u201d After sprouting this nonsense, Dong Xuebing nearly gave himself a tight slap. What sort of excuse was this? If he used the explanation of a bug was on her leg, even 3-year-olds will not believe him. But the reason for comparing the thickness of legs\u2026\u2026 even 1-year-olds will not believe him!Qu Yunxuan\u2019s neck was reddish. She continued to stare, angrily at him.Dong Xuebing was embarrassed. \u201cYour leg should be slimmer\u2026\u2026 Cough\u2026.. Yours is slimmer than mine.\u201dQu Yunxuan stared at Dong Xuebing for a few seconds, before reaching over to pull Dong Xuebing\u2019s ear. She twisted his ear, \u201cYou brat! How can you have no respect for your elders? You can just ask and not touch. Who said you can touch? You\u2026\u2026 If it is another woman, she would have slapped you!\u201dEh? For real?Aunt Xuan\u2019s tone\u2026\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound like she was angry.Yeah! Saved!\u201cI am talking to you. Do you hear me?\u201dQu Yunxuan smacked Dong Xuebing\u2019s head: \u201cEven if you are curious, you should not do this. If you want to know anything, you can ask me. I did not say I will not answer your questions!\u201d She raised her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t dare to hit you. If you touch me again, I will smack you to death! You hear me?\u201dHah! Do you look like you are going to hit me?Dong Xuebing could feel his blood rushing to his head. He was excited! Was this the result of changing my appearance and being meticulous? If not, Aunt Xuan will not forgive him for grabbing her thighs. She doesn\u2019t seem to be angry at all.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I am asking you a question!!\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I remember what you said. I will not touch you.\u201dQu Yunxuan smacked Dong Xuebing\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d She reached over to take her teacup and picked up the newspaper. She then rolled her eyes at Dong Xuebing. \u201cWomen\u2019s legs are all slimmer at the calves and thicker at the thighs. If you compare our thighs, my thighs are thicker than yours. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dQu Yunxuan did not continue the conversation and continue reading the papers.Dong Xuebing peeked at Qu Yunxuan and thought to himself. If Aunt Xuan were not interested in me, she would surely be angry, and I will not get away with only some scoldings. She would have slapped me. But\u2026\u2026 Aunt Xuan did not hit him and only scolded him. This\u2026\u2026. was not what a normal woman do!5 minutes passed\u2026\u202610 minutes passed\u2026..Dong Xuebing was sitting on the sofa fidgeting. He was rubbing his hands and thinking whether if he should make another attempt. But Aunt Xuan had told him not to touch her. Will she get angry? But the mood now was right, and if he were to miss this opportunity, it would be a pity. Dong Xuebing was weighing the pros and cons. Finally, he made his decision. He must not be indecisive. He must give it a try! He had even touched Aunt Xuan\u2019s thighs! What\u2019s there to be afraid of? At most he will get a beating from her!Dong Xuebing look over at Aunt Xuan\u2019s hand which was holding on to the newspaper. This time, Dong Xuebing did not dare to close his eyes. He leaned forward and reach out for her hand. His hand reached her palms and grabbed her 4 slender fingers. \u201cAunt Xuan, is your fingers thinner than mine?\u201dQu Yunxuan immediately retracted her hand and stared at Dong Xuebing, blushing. \u201cMine is thinner!\u201dSeeing Qu Yunxuan pulling her hand away from his, he was frustrated. He did not want to give up and reach over to hold her hand again.\u201cIrritating fellow!\u201d Qu Yunxuan had an angry expression on her face and pulled her hand back and slapped Dong Xuebing\u2019s thighs several times. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I said just now? I will hit you!\u201dDong Xuebing looked at her. He was determined to hold her hands. He does not care about her angry expression and reach over to hold her hand tightly.\u201cAre you trying to bully me?\u201d Qu Yunxuan pinched Dong Xuebing\u2019s thigh with her right hand. \u201cYou are making me mad.\u201d But this time\u2026\u2026 Qu Yunxuan did not pull back her left hand. She turned and faced another direction and held the papers with her right hand to continue reading.Dong Xuebing looked at her and squeezed her small hand softly.Qu Yunxuan\u2019s brows twitched but did not have any other reaction.Dong Xuebing squeezed her hand lightly again. He felt Aunt Xuan\u2019s fingers moved slightly and pinched his palm softly. It was like tickling his palm. Dong Xuebing immediately spread his fingers and interlocked with her fingers. It was like how lovers hold hands.Qu Yunxuan stared at him and turned away. She slowly\u2026\u2026 tightens her grip on his hand.At this very moment, Dong Xuebing could feel his heart racing. That\u2019s it! He had successfully held Aunt Xuan\u2019s hand!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She and his mother addressed each other as sisters and Dong Xuebing had no choice but to call her Aunt Xuan. But after a few days, Dong Xuebing was mesmerized by the virtuous Aunt Xuan. He secretly admired her. He dreamt of holding her hands to go out shopping or watching movies. 4 years had passed, and today, his wish had come true. It was too sudden, and he thought this was a dream. He could feel his happiness and excitement!Qu Yunxuan was still reading the papers. Dong Xuebing was not sure what she was thinking at this moment.Dong Xuebing secretly peeked at her and squeezed her hand: \u201cAunt Xuan, your hand is so fair.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Qu Yunxuan used the newspaper to hit Dong Xuebing\u2019s chest and blushed. \u201cIf you carry on sprouting nonsenses, I will tear your mouth!\u201d\u201cI am telling the truth.\u201d This was the first time Dong Xuebing held a woman\u2019s hand. He was very nervous. \u201cErrrrrr\u2026\u2026 do you still have other movies? Some romantic love movies?\u201dQu Yunxuan replied angrily: \u201cNo!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 We are not working today, let\u2019s watch some movies together.\u201dAunt Xuan rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t have any romantic movies. You want to watch horror movies?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ok. Horror movies are fine too. Where are the discs?\u201d Dong Xuebing walked over the to TV console and found a DVD. It was the latest series. He placed the disc into the DVD player and sat back on the sofa with the remote control. After he played the movie, his hand reached over towards Aunt Xuan. He wants to continue holding her hand.But Qu Yunxuan avoided his hand. \u201cStop fooling around and watch the movie.\u201dDong Xuebing replied earnestly. \u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 let me hold your hand. I am afraid you will be scared by the movie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 No need. I am not afraid of anything.\u201dDamn. Nevermind. Dong Xuebing replied: \u201cI am timid. Can you hold my hand?\u201d\u201cGlib-tongue!\u201d Qu Yunxuan looked at him through the corner of her eyes and paused for a few seconds before moving her left hand nearer to Dong Xuebing.Dong Xuebing was overjoyed. He happily reached over and held that small fair hand. They held hands and watch that horror film. This film was too horrific. The actor and actress were killed one after another. But Dong Xuebing was not concentrating on the movie. He was watching , but he was feeling blissful in his heart. Throughout the movie, he was smiling and laughing.Smacked! Aunt Xuan slapped Dong Xuebing\u2019s leg. \u201cWhy are you laughing? Is it funny to see people get killed?\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u2026 this film is interesting. This is a good move.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so good about this movie? Everyone is all dead.\u201dDong Xuebing was in a state of excitement for over an hour. He was still feeling excited after the movie ends. Dong Xuebing looked at his watch. It was almost noon. \u201cIt\u2019s almost lunchtime. Shall we go out and eat? I will treat you to some western cuisine. Errr\u2026\u2026. Chinese food is also fine as long as you like it.\u201dQu Yunxuan looked at him. \u201cYou had just bought a bag and a scarf for me yesterday. You got to save up for rainy days. Your salary is lesser than mine.\u201dDong Xuebing replied: \u201cThat\u2019s no such things. I am now richer than you. Let\u2019s go. Western cuisine or Chinese cuisine?\u201dQu Yunxuan heard what Dong Xuebing said and knocked his head: \u201cIs your salary more than 4,000 RMB? I think your salary is not even 3,000 RMB. You still need money for your daily expenses and give your mother money. You are still buying me gifts. How much money is left at the end of the month? Oh, your this month\u2019s salary is still not out. After buying those gifts for me, do you still have enough? If you do need money, I can lend you some.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 I really do not lack money.\u201d Dong Xuebing still have more than 200,000 RMB in his account.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Even so, we should also not eat out. It\u2019s too expensive. We can cook at home. We still have ingredients.\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s relationship with Qu Yunxuan had just moved up to the next level, and he really wanted to bring her out for a date. But Qu Yunxuan was insistent on eating at home. So, he gave in. \u201c\u2026\u2026 Fine. I will help you with the cooking.|Qu Yunxuan nodded and stood up. She looked at Dong Xuebing: \u201c\u2026\u2026 your hand.\u201dDong Xuebing also stood up and feign ignorance. \u201cHand? What\u2019s wrong with my hand?\u201dQu Yunxuan stared at him with the corner of her eyes. She had the charms of a mature woman. \u201cAre you not shy? Do you think I don\u2019t dare to hit you?\u201dDong Xuebing released his hand unwillingly when they entered the kitchen. He picked up the knife and start cutting tomatoes and cucumbers. He looked back at Qu Yunxuan, who was washing the vegetables at the basin. A few droplets of water was splashed onto her collar bones and trickled down her cleavage. She froze and wiped her chest with the back of her hand.Dong Xuebing could feel temperatures rising. He asked an obvious question: \u201cAunt Xuan, do you have a boyfriend?\u201dQu Yunxuan paused for a second and replied without turning back while washing the cucumbers. \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201dDong Xuebing put down the knife and wiped his hands. \u201cErrr\u2026. You don\u2019t have a boyfriend, and I also do not have a girlfriend. We should be a couple. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201dQu Yunxuan closed the tap and stared at him angrily. \u201cGreat? You are so much younger than me!\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026. You are only older than me than a few years.|\u201cHave you not heard of a saying in Beijing? A woman who is 3 years older is comparable to a golden brick. A woman who is older by 5 years\u2026\u2026\u201d Qu Yunxuan did not continue.Dong Xuebing had heard of this saying. A woman who is 3 years older is comparable to a golden brick. A woman who is older by 5 years\u2026\u2026 is similar to a mother. This saying is telling you that if you get a woman older than you by 5 years, you are getting another mother. This is a taboo in the eyes of the older generations. Dong Xuebing was observing Qu Yunxuan\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal of being 5 years older? Even if you are 50 years older than me, I will still like you!\u201dQu Yunxuan burst out laughing and replied angrily. \u201cAre you saying that I am an old demon?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I only\u2026\u2026 wanted to tell you that the age difference is not a problem.\u201d\u201cThen what is considered a problem? You are so much younger than me. My relationship with your mother is already a problem. Stop talking nonsenses in the future. Other people will laugh at you.\u201d Qu Yunxuan passed the cucumber to Dong Xuebing. \u201cHurry up and cut it.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that if your mother and my mother agree, we can start dating?\u201d\u201cThis is not what I meant.\u201d\u201cHuh? Then what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI am asking you to hurry up and cut the vegetables!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Please tell me what do you mean.\u201dQu Yunxuan was blushing, and she raises her hand. \u201cIf you start cutting the vegetables, I will hit you!\u201dDong Xuebing was disappointed when he did not get the answer he wanted. He stopped asking and start to chop the vegetables. The cucumber was cut into all sorts of sizes.Qu Yunxuan looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m unhappy and venting my frustrations! Dong Xuebing kept quiet and start to chop the potatoes.Qu Yunxuan sighed and mumbled: \u201cThis kid is so hard to please.\u201d She paused for a second. \u201c\u2026\u2026, give me your hand.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI ask you to give me your hand.\u201dDong Xuebing stretched out his hand, puzzled.Qu Yunxuan looked at him and held his hand slowly. \u201cCan you cut the vegetables properly now?\u201d\u201cHuh? How can I cut the vegetables with one hand?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s your problem.\u201dDong Xuebing swallowed his salivia. He knew he should not rush her to be in a relationship with him. Aunt Xuan had already let him hold her hands and this was prove that she also likes him. Dong Xuebing immediately cheered up. He decided to take one step at a time. Today he got to hold her hands and touch her legs. Next time, he wanted to try kissing with her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the feelings of Dong Xuebing now.After holding hands with the woman he secretly admired for years, Dong Xuebing could not think straight. He spent the whole Sunday marketing with Aunt Xuan, accompanying her to have meals, watch movies, etc. Other than going to the toilet and sleeping, both of them spent all their time together. Dong Xuebing could not forget the feeling of holding her hands. He kept thinking about the feeling, and on Monday morning, he realized that he had forgotten to do an important thing. That day was the most uneasy day of his life!Dong Xuebing had forgotten to use his Sunday\u2019s BACK!Dong Xuebing still have not fully understood his power BACK. Since he had gotten this power from the accident, he only knows that this BACK can turn back time to one minute ago and he has one chance to use it every day. After he had gotten this power, he maintained the principle of using power every day. Even if nothing happens in the day, he will use BACK before he sleeps. This had become his habit, and he had done so without fail. Dong Xuebing also did not think about what would happen if he missed using his power for a day, and he also did not dare to try. He had benefited from his power, and there was no way he could do without it. What if the condition of his power was he must use it every day? If he missed one day, the power would be gone?Restless, uneasiness, and nervous!Back! You must not leave me! I still have to depend on you for my future happiness!\u201cXiao Bing, why are you in a daze so early in the morning? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cHuh? I\u2019m just thinking about something. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d When Dong Xuebing came back to his senses, he noticed Aunt Xuan kneeling in front of the sofa, helping him to tie his shoelaces. Dong Xuebing immediately bend down to stop her. \u201cStop, stop. I can tie my own laces. Your neck and back are not good, and you might injure yourself.\u201d\u201cI am not that weak.\u201d Qu Yunxuan tied his shoelaces for him and stood up to straighten his tie for him. \u201cOk. You look great today. It\u2019s time for you to go to work.\u201dDong Xuebing nodded. \u201cYou should also leave early. You might get caught in a traffic jam if you are late.\u201d\u201cOk. If I am not working late today, I will prepare dinner and wait for you.\u201dAfter Dong Xuebing went downstairs, away from Qu Yunxuan\u2019s sight, his smiling face was replaced by a dejected look. He really wanted to try BACK to see if his power was still around. But after thinking about it for a while, he decided to leave it for now as he still did not know what would happen at work. What if he said the wrong things again? So, Dong Xuebing resisted the urge to try his power until he finishes work. If some accidents happened during work, he could still test his powers.1 hour\u2026\u20263 hours\u2026\u20265 hours\u2026\u2026.Soon, it was time to get off work. Dong Xuebing did not make any mistakes at work.Dong Xuebing carried his bag and walked out of the branch bureau. He decided to use BACK immediately. Please\u2026\u2026. Don\u2019t let BACK disappear!\u201cChief Dong, you have are going back?\u201d A girl from the General Affairs Department smiles and greeted him.Dong Xuebing nodded and replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBye. I will make a move first.\u201d The girl smiled and walked towards another direction.Dong Xuebing remembers that this girl\u2019s surname was Guo. After this girl walked past him, he took a deep breath and said, \u201cBACK!\u201d quietly.\u2026\u2026The scenes changed!That staff member was walking towards Dong Xuebing. \u201cChief Dong, you have are going back?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBye. I will make a move first.\u201dIt was exactly 60 seconds before. Time had returned back to 1 minute ago!Dong Xuebing was sweating from his nervousness. He was afraid that his powers would be gone. Now, he was relieved. All the worries were gone. He cheered up and walked towards the bus stop smiling. He stood at the bus stop to wait for his bus and thought to himself. Since BACK was not affected for missing one day, then he does not need to worry about forgetting to waste his powers before midnight. Oh, it\u2019s not considered wasting. It should be called practicing. If he had not practiced and experimented with his power, he would not be so familiar with it. For instance, if he used BACK while walking, he will trip and fall in the past. But now, he can still carry on walking normally after he returned to one minute before. He had practiced this movement dozens of times.Hiss\u2026\u2026. It was the sounds of a bus breaking as it enters the bus stop.A woman, who was in charge of maintaining order, was waving a small red flag. \u201cSwipe your card and board the bus from the front door.\u201dDong Xuebing was standing near to the front. But the bus stop was too crowded, and he was pushed behind by the crowd.Damn! What\u2019s the rush? This is considered uncivilized behavior.Dong Xuebing was now a small leader. It will be a joke if any of his colleagues saw him jostling and pushing with the crowd to board the bus. So, he stepped aside and let the passengers board before him. He was the last to board after everyone. He stepped onto the steps of the packed bus.It might be the issue of the blind spot. The driver closes the door as Dong Xuebing was boarding the bus.Dong Xuebing got a shock and immediately pushed the person in front of him and board the bus. But he could not get out of the way in time, and his left hand was caught in the bus doors!\u201cAh!\u201d Dong Xuebing shouted in pain. He natural instincts kicked in and shouted BACK!This was his usual reaction, and he did this unconsciously. After he shouted BACK, he slapped his forehead. He had used it 5 minutes ago outside the bureau. What\u2019s the use of shouting now? But the next second, Dong Xuebing was stunned!\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing\u2019s surroundings were not crowded anymore. His hand does not hurt, and he was standing at the bus stop.\u201cSwipe your card and board the bus from the front door.\u201d The woman was waving a small red flag, and all the passengers were rushing forward!Huh? BACK happened again? Now it was 60 seconds ago?!What the fuck!? Impossible! How can this be possible?! I had used BACK once today! How come I can use it twice? Looking at what was happening in front of him, Dong Xuebing still could not believe his eyes. He stood there in a daze even after the bus left the bus stop!What just happened?Eh? Wait!Twice? I used BACK twice?Dong Xuebing immediately thought of one reason!Could it be\u2026\u2026 the Sunday\u2019s BACK did not disappear and was accumulated to Monday?Damn! Don\u2019t tell me BACK can be accumulated??If this is real, then it would be possible to turn back time to 5 or 10 minutes ago Dong Xuebing accumulated 5 to 10 days of BACK!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDong Xuebing, who had discovered the ability to accumulate his BACK\u2019s timings, was surprised and shocked. He was not sure if he was right. Could BACK be only accumulated for only one day? If he carries on accumulating his BACK, will he be able to use it several times in a row? Dong Xuebing felt he must experiment with it. This way, he will be able to use BACK to its full effects. So, he stopped himself from using his powers. From Tuesday to Saturday, five days, Dong Xuebing did not use BACK. If his guess were right, he would have collected 6 days of BACK, including Sunday\u2019s. That means Dong Xuebing would be able to reverse time to 6 minutes ago!Sunday.Morning, at 8.30 am.Dong Xuebing was sitting on his sofa and lowered the volume of his TV. He grabbed his iPhone 4 on the coffee table and stared at the time on the phone. He was able to experiment with BACK.Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong. Someone was at the door.Dong Xuebing thought it was Aunt Xuan and immediately rushed into the bathroom to comb his hair before opening the door.But it was not Aunt Xuan. It was a middle-aged woman. \u201cHahaha, did you just wake up?\u201d\u201cOh, Auntie, why are you here? Come in please.\u201d Dong Xuebing stepped aside and invite her into her house. \u201cI had just woke up. What time did you arrive? Where\u2019s Aunt Xuan?\u201d This woman was Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother. She seldom comes over to visit Aunt Xuan, and Dong Xuebing had only seen her a few times over the years.\u201cI have just arrived. Yunxuan had received a call and had to meet her clients.\u201d Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother passed a paper box to Dong Xuebing. \u201cI have brought some prawns from my hometown. Keep it in the refrigerator.\u201d\u201cThank you. You don\u2019t need to bring anything over.\u201d Dong Xuebing said and kept the box of prawns in his freezer.\u201cI must bring something for you.\u201d Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother smiles. \u201cYunxuan had only told me that you saved her life this morning. If I know about this incident earlier, I would have come over to thank you immediately after the incident.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201dAfter thanking, Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother starts to praise Dong Xuebing. \u201cI have not seen you for half a year? You look better now. There should be a lot of girls after you now, right? Oh, I heard from Yunxuan that you have entered the government service for 2 months and got promoted? Hehehe, you are really capable. From your features, I know you are blessed. You should be promoted to Deputy Section Chief within 3 years. Your mother will be proud of you.\u201dDong Xuebing felt embarrassed and replied modestly.Ring, ring, ring. Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother phone rang. She was using a pink colored smartphone. \u201cHello, who is this? Oh\u2026\u2026 Sis\u2026\u2026 you saw me? Hohoho, yes. I am now at Xiao Bing\u2019s house\u2026\u2026. Sure. I will drop by your house later\u2026\u2026 Sis\u2026.. your voice sounds sweeter than before\u2026\u2026 you should be prettier since I last saw you\u2026\u2026. No? Impossible\u2026\u2026 you look the same as 30 years ago. Your looks did not change at all\u2026.. I really envy you\u2026. Hahaha\u2026\u2026 Ok\u2026. Wait for me. I will be over at your place in a while.\u201dDong Xuebing knew Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother was someone who always pays compliments to others. She had a sweet tongue. She will praise anyone she met. It might be fine if you heard it the first or second time. But after the eighth or tenth time\u2026\u2026 Dong Xuebing felt it was too fake.\u201cAuntie, if you are busy, please carry on.\u201dQu Yunxuan\u2019s mother smiles as she hangs up her phone. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing important. Mrs. Zhou from the second floor asks me to drop by her place for a chat.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 Do you want to have tea? Do you prefer flower tea or red tea?\u201d\u201cHahaha, our Xiao Bing is more sensible now. Don\u2019t bother. I am leaving soon. Oh, I need to ask you something.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s is it?\u201dQu Yunxuan\u2019s mother lowered her voice and asked: \u201cI have been asking Yunxuan, but she refuses to tell me. Is she dating anyone right now?\u201dDong Xuebing jumped slightly and replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cThen is there anyone after her? How many have you met? How do they look like? Are they rich?\u201dDamn! I am the one after your daughter. How should I answer you?! Dong Xuebing cleared his throat: \u201cThere is surely be men after Aunt Xuan. But I am not sure whether if they are rich or not. Are you talking about their salaries or jobs?\u201d\u201cIt would be best if the man is from a wealthy family and his parents should be some sort of big boss.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone like that.\u201dQu Yunxuan\u2019s mother grumbled: \u201cShe is already so old and she is still not anxious about her future. She is just working every day. Xiao Bing, how long do you think it will take for her to save enough to set up her own company with her miserable salary? She still insists on waiting under she has her own career before she considers dating anyone. She might have to wait for years. I really wish she would hurry up and get married to a wealthy family. This way, she will be able to set up her own family, and at the same time, she will have her own company. Isn't this a good idea?\u201dDong Xuebing mumbled a reply.\u201cOk. I should be going. I will visit you another day.\u201d Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother stood up. \u201cXiao Bing, help me talk to Yunxuan. If you know any guy that have acceptable looks and a wealthy family, let me know.\u201d\u201cOk. Be careful on your way out.\u201dAfter Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother left, Dong Xuebing sat down on the sofa. He did not blame Qu Yunxuan for being snobbish. All parents want the best for their children. They all wanted their daughters to get married to someone who could take care of them financially. Aunt Xuan is so pretty and gentle, and the requirements for her partner should be higher. Dong Xuebing knew Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother would surely look down on him if he wants to be Qu Yunxuan\u2019s boyfriend unless he can take out 1 million RMB for her to set up a company. That might also cover the fact that he was much younger than Qu Yunxuan and gained her mother\u2019s approval.Dong Xuebing picked up his iPhone 4 again to experiment with his power.But he held the phone in his hands and did not say the magic word, BACK. He then put down his phone.It would be a waste if this experiment were a success. It\u2019s 6 minutes. He could do a lot with 6 minutes!Dong Xuebing paced around his living room with his hands behind his back. He was thinking of how he could earn 1 million RMB. He thought about what Qu Yunxuan\u2019s mother said. Dong Xuebing suddenly stopped. He had a bold idea. Time waits for no one, and it was not easy to wait for 6 days. This was a rare opportunity, and he should use the BACK he saved up, to make money. If he succeeds, he will be able to make a large sum. If he did not succeed, he would lose 220,000 RMB at most.That\u2019s right! He got to take a gamble!But what should he do?6 minutes\u2026\u2026 6 minutes\u2026\u2026 6 minutes\u2026\u2026Ah!Dong Xuebing suddenly brightens up. If I have enough time, why not go for stone gambling?!If BACK had accumulated to 6 minutes\u2026\u2026 then he will surely win this gamble!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was 9.20 am. Dong Xuebing took out his sling bag, which contains 110,000 RMB from the sales of the antique books, from his closet. After that, he went to the ICBC bank across the road from his house. This was a small branch, and one-day notification was needed for withdrawals more than 50,000 RMB. Dong Xuebing, who had wanted to withdraw 100,000 RMB from his account, was lazy to go to another branch. So, he only withdraws 50,000 RMB. 160,000 RMB should be enough. He pulled up the collar of his jacket and walk out to the streets to flag a taxi. He went straight to the stores outside of Panjiayuan. Many stores were selling raw stones there.\u201cBoss, do you have any unprocessed jade stones?\u201d\u201cNo. We only sell finished products here. You can try other shops.\u201d\u201cExcuse me, can I gamble stones or jade here?\u201d\u201cOh, we do not have these.\u201d\u201cDo you know where I can gamble stones?\u201d\u201cStone gambling? There is not a lot of such places in Panjiayuan. If you are interested, you can go to the Haidian or Chaoyang districts. Every weekend, there are auctions for unprocessed stones. The prices are reasonable, and the quality of the stones are higher.\u201d Dong Xuebing also know about the auctions in Haidian\u2019s antique market. But the procedures there was to pay for the stones first before cutting. It takes too much time. His 6 minutes was not enough to even bid for the stones. This was why Dong Xuebing was targeting those smaller shops.Dong Xuebing carries on walking around Panjiayuan.Suddenly, there were sounds of a stone cutting machine from a distance.Dong Xuebing\u2019s eyes widen. When he was working part-time in the past, he had seen people gambling stones. This was why he was familiar with this sound. He raised his head and walked towards the direction of the sound. But when Dong Xuebing reaches the shop, he saw a man using the stone cutter to cut a stone. It was not a jade stone. From the color and shape of the stone, it should be uncut crystal stones. Natural crystals. Crystal gambling? This was rare. Dong Xuebing hesitated for a while and then entered the shop. Crystal gambling, Agate gambling, turquoise gambling, Nephrite jade gambling, and jade stone gambling, can all be considered stone gambling. Dong Xuebing does not need to specifically to look for jade stones or Nephrite jade stones. The returns for crystal gambling was high too.The cutter machine stopped, and a small window was cut out of the natural purple crystal stone.The buyers were a young couple, and the girl asked. \u201cIs this crystal good? How much can it sells?\u201d\u201cThe color inside is ordinary.\u201d The overweight boss put down the cutting machine and take a closer look at the stone. \u201cIt\u2019s worth 800 to 1,000 RMB.\u201d\u201cWe bought it for 5000 RMB, and we can only sell it for 1,000 RMB?\u201d The woman heard the boss and gave her boyfriend a slap angrily. \u201cI told you not to buy it, and you insist. See, we lost!\u201d Only 1 out of 10 wins in stone gambling. Although the risk for crystal stone gambling was not as high as jade stone gambling, it\u2019s almost the same. It\u2019s normal to pick worthless stones. If anyone could find an unprocessed stone worth tens of thousand RMB with 5,000 RMB, it will be abnormal. Furthermore, Beijing was not a place known for stone gamblings. All the unprocessed stones were brought in from other places and were the leftovers from the quarries. This increases the difficulties of winning in stone gambling.That man was pissed to hear his girlfriend scolding him. He gritted his teeth: \u201cThis and that! Open up these two!\u201dThe girl shouted angrily: \u201cStop buying! You can put the money to better use!\u201dThe man ignored her and paid the boss.\u201cOk. I will cut it the same way as earlier.\u201d The overweight boss grabbed the stone cutter and start to cut the stone steadily. The blades of the cutter cut across the surface of the stone. Crystals were not as hard as jade, and it was faster to cut a crystal stone than a jade stone.1 cut\u2026\u20265 cuts\u2026\u202610 cuts\u2026\u2026Screeched\u2026\u2026 after a while, both the big and small crystal stones were cut, and the colorless crystal was exposed. The bigger stone had air bubbles, and it was worthless. The smaller one did not have any defects, but the color was normal, and it was not worth the price he paid for it.The young couple left the shop with their crystals arguing.Not long later, an old man spent 10,000 RMB to buy a bigger yellow crystal uncut stone. In the end, there was some dirt, the size of a fingernail, in the crystal and the value of this crystal dropped. At about 11 am, a group of tourist entered the shop and bought 4 to 5 pieces of natural crystal stones. The best piece was valued at the price they purchased, and the rest were worthless.This was stone gambling. There were more losers than winners. It all depends on luck.Dong Xuebing had doubts. After standing there for so long, there was not one person who won. Can he really make money from this?\u201cYoung man, do you want to try your luck?\u201d The fat shopowner asked as he wiped his hands with a towel.Dong Cuebing, who was standing by the entrance, was not ready yet. He shook his head and entered the shop to look at the crystal ornaments on display. He pointed to a few of them and asked: \u201cHow much is this pink crystal necklace? 800 RMB? What about that purple crystal Guanyin statue? 20,000 RMB? How about that piece? 130,000 RMB?\u201d The items on display ranged from tens of RMB to over 100,000 RMB. The prices depend on the color, clarity, and size of the crystals.\u201cThe finished products are expensive.\u201d The shop owner tried to entice Dong Xuebing. \u201cWhy not try your luck with these stones? Maybe you will be rich overnight!\u201dDong Xuebing just smiled and thought to himself. He might also be bankrupt overnight!After lunch, Dong Xuebing returned to the shop and spent one hour standing there watching and learning. Soon, he understood how crystal stone gambling and how the crystals were valued. Natural purple crystals were more valuable than natural yellow crystals. Natural yellow crystals were worth more than colorless crystals. The darker the colors, the more expensive was the crystal. One-color was worth more than multi-colors ones. The purer crystals worth more than those with impurities. The weight also plays a part in determining the value. The heavier the crystal, the more valuable it was. If there were acicular inclusions in the crystal, it will worth more. The value would increase further if the acicular in the crystal were in the same direction.After learning this, Dong Xuebing had a plan in mind. He started to calculate the time needed to cut a crystal stone. If the stone were cut carefully from the sides slowly, it would take a longer time. But if a bigger portion was cut, without worrying about damaging the crystals inside, it will be much faster. It will take less than a minute.10 minutes later, Dong Xuebing was ready to act out his plan.Dong Xuebing took a deep breath. Ok! Let\u2019s start!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He picked up a stone, about 2 to 2.5 kg. He examines it closely. There was a small window cut at a corner. The crystal inside was colorless and clear. The quality of this crystal seems to be of a higher grade. But Dong Xuebing knew the shopowners will cut the best part of the stone to show the customers. It might show high-quality crystal from this small cut, but the crystal might not be the same for the other parts of the stone. \u201cBoss, how much is this piece?\u201dThe shopowner was sweeping the dust, and he looked up. \u201cOh, that\u2019s 10,000 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing pointed to another purple crystal stone. That stone does not have any cuts. \u201cHow about that piece?\u201d\u201c35,000 EMB.\u201d\u201cThat yellow crystal stone?\u201d\u201cThat is bigger. 40,000 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing asked the prices of the bigger stones. This way, the chances of having bigger crystals were higher. After confirming the prices, Dong Xuebing reached inside his pocket and played a ringtone before taking out his iPhone 4 to pretend to answer a call. He pretended to be speaking to someone and then hang up. \u201cBoss, I would like to buy some crystals. But I need to rush off. If you can cut the stones faster, I will buy a few pieces at once. If not, I will go off.\u201dThe shop owner would not give up any business. \u201cHurry up and pick the stones. I can cut the stones fast.\u201d\u201cFine. These two purple crystals, that yellow crystal, that colorless crystal, and that pink crystal.\u201d\u201cWait, let me calculate.\u201d The shop owner picked up his calculator and punched in the numbers. \u201cThe total is 162,000 RMB. I will round it off to 160,000 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing took out the stacks of money from his back and pressed the countdown timer on his phone. 360 seconds.The shop owner could tell Dong Xuebing was a novice. But he never expects Dong Xuebing to spend 160,000 RMB to gamble crystal stones. The young men nowadays were so rich. He picked up the stacks of RMB and place it into the money counting machine beside him. 10,000\u2026\u2026 50,000\u2026\u2026 100,000\u2026\u2026 He counted twice, and the amount was right.\u201dThere were 312 seconds left.Dong Xuebing anxiously said. \u201cStart cutting the stones. Don\u2019t need to grind it bit by bit. Cut it diagonally from an angle will do.\u201dThe shop owner was stunned. \u201cOh, you will damage some of the crystals inside. Are you sure?\u201d\u201cYes. Please hurry.\u201dThere were 303 seconds left.The shop owner had promised Dong Xuebing that he will cut the stones fast. His movements were swift as he rolled up his sleeves and kneel down beside that colorless crystal stone. He held the cutter in his hand and picked an angle before pressing the cutter against the stone!Eeeeeee! Eeeeeee! Eeeeeee! The stonecutter cut through the outer layer of the stone!There were 280 seconds left!Dong Xuebing clenched his fist tightly. Please hurry up!Eeeeeee! The screeching sounds of the cutter were loud! Suddenly the noise stopped!The colorless crystal stone was cut open. The cut surface was smooth, but there were specks of black spots. The shop owner rubbed it with his fingers and could not remove it. \u201cThere are not dirt. It\u2019s the impurities in the crystal. What a pity.\u201d Having impurities in the crystals will lower the value of the stone. This stone which cost 10,000 RMB was not worthless.Dong Xuebing cursed under his breath and immediately said: \u201cForget about that and cut the next stone!\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d The shop owner turned and start to cut the yellow crystal stone.There were 241 seconds left!Dong Xuebing was rubbing his palms together and praying. Please, let me get a good crystal stone without impurities!Eeeeeee! Eeeeeee! The second stone was cut open, and there were no impurities. But the yellow color was not very dark. There was only a slight tint of yellow in the crystal. It was almost like colorless crystals. This stone which cost 30,000 RMB was worth less than 10,000 RMB now!Damn!Dong Xuebing gritted his teeth and said: \u201cNext one!\u201dThere were 195 seconds left.Eeeeeee! Eeeeeee! Eeeeeee! The third pink crystal stone was cut open!This time, the shop owner might have chosen a wrong angle to cut. He did not cut it diagonally. He just cut out a small portion of the stone, but from that small window, they could see lots of tiny bubbles in the crystal. This piece was another worthless piece!Dong Xuebing slapped his thighs angrily. \u201cNext!\u201dHe only has 141 seconds left, and there were 2 purple crystal stones left.132 seconds\u2026\u2026.112 seconds\u2026\u2026.98 seconds\u2026\u2026.Dong Xuebing had seen many people losing money from crystal stone gambling. He thought they were unlucky. But he never expects his luck to be much worse than them. That 35,000 RMB smaller purple crystal stone was cut opened and the color\u2026\u2026 Lousy could not even be used to describe the crystal. There were a big crack and two black lines of impurities. It was totally worthless!There was only the bigger purple crystal stone left!There were only 88 seconds left!The shop owner looked at Dong Xuebing, and the frustrated Dong Xuebing said: \u201cCut! Continue!\u201d He was really unlucky today.The fat shop owner was not surprised. He knew his stones well. This batch of crystal stones was bought from his friend in the southern province. It was from his friend\u2019s factory. There were all low-grade stones which were unsold. It would be a surprise if there were any high-grade crystals in there. Oh, there might still be a possibility of a high-grade crystal stone mixed among the stones. After all, the crystals in the stones could not be graded with any equipment. No one could tell for sure if the uncut stones contain high-grade crystals.76 seconds\u2026\u202652 seconds\u2026\u202647 seconds\u2026\u2026The last purple stone was cut. It contains colorless crystals. The crystals in the center were almost transparent. There were still specks of dirt in the crystal, and some parts were greyish. This was another worthless crystal!Dong Xuebing was furious. 160,000 RMB! 160,000 RMB was wasted. He was speechless!That\u2019s it? It\u2019s all over?That\u2019s right! There was still time! 39 seconds were remaining!Dong Xuebing did not waste time choosing the stones. He pointed to a bigger stone beside the shop owner and said: \u201cPlease cut that one!\u201dThe shop owner looked at the stone. \u201cThis cost 50,000 RMB.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately said: \u201cCut it first. I will pay you in a while!\u201dThe shop owner did not move. \u201cI am only running a small business\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI do not have so much cash with me now.\u201d Dong Xuebing took out his identification card and place it on the table. \u201cI will leave my identification card with you and will go to the bank later to withdraw money. Is that fine?\u201dThe shop owner saw the way Dong Xuebing bought the stones and knew that he should not run away. He nodded.There were 24 seconds left!Dong Xuebing had only 60,000 RMB left in his bank. If this crystal is a low-grade crystal and his BACK cannot be used continuously, he will lose everything!Eeeeeee!There were 13 seconds left!Dong Xuebing looked at the time remaining on his phone. \u201cPlease hurry up!\u201dThe shop owner used more strength to cut the stone. 1 cm\u2026\u2026 2 cm\u2026\u2026 3 cm\u2026\u20268 seconds remain!6 seconds remain!5 seconds remain!There was no more time!Just when Dong Xuebing was about to say BACK at the final 3 seconds, Crack! The outer layer of the stone was cut open and dropped onto the floor!It\u2019s cut!Dong Xuebing quickly move forward to look at the crystal!\u201cThis\u2026\u2026 This is acicular crystal?\u201d The shop owner was stunned.\u201cAh?\u201d Dong Xuebing was also surprised. \u201cYou mean the type of crystals that have acicular inside?!\u201d\u201cYes! This is worth a lot!\u201d The color, size, and purity of this crystal were all top grade. The shop owner also did not expect to find such high-grade crystal among this batch of stones!Dong Xuebing was stunned for a second and shouted in his heart: BACK! BACK! BACK! BACK! BACK! BACK!He said BACK six times!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEvery time BACK was shouted, the scenes in front of Dong Xuebing flashed.The first time, Dong Xuebing saw the fat shop owner looking down cutting the stone. This was 60 seconds ago.The second time, Dong Xuebing saw the fat shop owner talking to him. This was 120 seconds ago.The third time, Dong Xuebing saw the fat shop owner touching the crystal stone, preparing to cut it. This was 180 seconds ago.\u2026\u2026Dong Xuebing\u2019s body and eyes could not keep up with the fast-changing flashes and became giddy. When he came back to his senses, his surroundings were no longer flashing. He felt he had just got off a roller coaster. His legs were wobbly and immediately grabbed onto a corner of the table. Sweat was dripping off his forehead.\u201cOh, are you ok?\u201d The shop owner looked at Dong Xuebing and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dDong Xuebing blinked and steadied himself. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Errr\u2026\u2026. Where did I stop just now?\u201d\u201cWhere did you stop?\u201d The shop owner was looking at him weirdly and pointed to the few crystal stones on the floor. \u201cYou said you want these two purple crystal, that yellow crystal, that colorless crystal, and that pick crystal.\u201d The shop owner answered Dong Xuebing and lift up his calculator. \u201cThe total is 162,000 RMB. I will round it off to 160,000 RMB.\u201dGod damn! It succeeded!Dong Xuebing was overjoyed and had forgotten that he was still gambling.The shop owner saw Dong Xuebing laughing to himself and felt a cold shiver up his spine. Was this person crazy? He sub-consciously took one step back from Dong Xuebing and asked: \u201cYou are in a hurry? Do you want all 5 pieces? I will cut those stones for you now?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Dong Xuebing returned back to his senses. \u201cI will not be on time even if I rush back now. You can take your time to cut the stones slowly.\u201d Dong Xuebing said and looked at the stones on the floor. His eyes immediately stopped on the last stone the shop owner cut before he used BACK. \u201cThose 5 pieces are too expensive. I do not want them anymore. Hmmm\u2026\u2026 That piece. Yes. That piece that is slightly smaller than a football. How much is that?\u201dThe shop owner looked at that stone and replied: \u201cThat piece? 20,000 RMB.\u201d\u201c20,000 RMB!?\u201d Dong Xuebing heard the price and cursed in his heart. Before he uses BACK, the shop owner quoted him 50,000 RMB. The shop owner should have quoted Dong Xuebing a much higher price as he was in a hurry and do not have time to bargain. \u201cThere are no small cuts on this piece. 20,000 RMB is too expensive.\u201dThe shop owner shook his head. \u201cThe weight and size are worth this much.\u201dDong Xuebing was in a hurry earlier and did not have time to examine this stone. He moves closer and picks up the stone. He pointed to the left side of the rock. \u201cThere is a crack here. It is a deep crack. The crystals on this side should be useless. The value of this crystal should be halved.\u201dThe shop owner also knows that this stone was not worth much. He thought for a while. \u201c18,000 RMB. This is the final price.\u201dDong Xuebing immediately passed him the money. \u201cStart from the side without the crack.\u201dThe shop owner nodded and carried the stone to a corner to start cutting. He was facing the side of the crack, and he knew the crystals inside should not be any high-grade crystals. He picked up the stone cutting machine, switched it on and slowly press it against the side without the crack.1st cut\u2026\u2026 2nd cut\u2026\u2026 3rd cut\u2026\u2026 A small opening was cut through the dusty surface of the stone.5th cut\u2026\u2026 6th cut\u2026\u2026 7th cut\u2026.. The opening was cut bigger, and it formed a finger width size window. They could see the crystals inside!Dong Xuebing quickly walk over. He did not see the crystals earlier and was nervous.The shop owner wiped the dust off the surface and looked at the crystals. He was stunned.The crystals were colorless and very clear. The shop owner could also see silver-colored needle-like crystals inside through the small opening. Some of the needles were slightly curved, and some were straight. It was beautiful!\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d The shop owner cried out in surprise: \u201cAcicular crystal! Silver acicular crystals!!!\u201dDong Xuebing pumped his fist! It\u2019s really acicular crystal!The shop owner took out a torchlight and shine into the opening. How could a silver acicular crystal appear in this batch of low-grade crystal stones? This young man was too lucky. He had only picked one stone and won the top prize? Damn! I should have open a small window first before selling!Maybe it was because of the sounds from the shop, two passers-by walked in.\u201cSilver acicular crystal? It is from stone gambling? Let me take a look!\u201d One middle-aged man took the torchlight from the shop owner and examine the crystal.The other middle-aged man looked at Dong Xuebing and asked: \u201cYou are lucky. How much did you spend?\u201dDong Xuebing smiled: \u201c18,000 RMB.\u201d\u201cHahaha, you should be able to make a large sum from this.\u201dThat middle-aged man finished examing the crystal and nodded to his friend. He turned to Dong Xuebing and asked. \u201cAre you selling this crystal?\u201dDong Xuebing replied. \u201cIt depends on how much you are offering..\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026 how about 80,000 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing shook his head.\u201c90,000 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing shook his head again.That man smiled. \u201c90,000 RMB is my highest offer. You should consider my offer. This stone is not fully opened. There might be a risk. Look, there is a deep crack on the other side. If the crack extended into the crystal, then part of it will be useless. It cannot be used to carve out big ornaments. It can only be made into a small Guanyin statue.\u201dDong Xuebing only smile at him and turn to the shop owner. \u201cBoss, continue to cut the stone open. This time, start from the cracked part.\u201dThe shop owner did not move. \u201cYoung man, I suggest you sell it. If this crack is too deep, then this stone will not be worth so high. 90,000 RMB is really a good offer.\u201dDong Xuebing had seen the shop owner cut open this stone from the cracked part before he used BACK. Although he did not see whether if there were acicular crystals, but thee surface was clear, and there were no impurities. This was why he had no hesitations. \u201cJust cut it.\u201dThe shop owner did not persuade him anymore. He picked up the stone cutting machine and start to cut the outer layer bit by bit.Eeeeee! Eeeee!It was only the first cut, and everyone in the shop were shocked. Part of the crack was cut away!The shop owner paused for a while and proceeded to make another cut. Another part of the 3 mm deep crack was cut away!The shop owner made the 3rd cut! 4th cut!The crack was gone entirely, and the colorless, clear crystal inside was exposed!The crack did not extend into the crystal! It was only on the out layer of the stone!The two middle-aged men looked at each other and took a deep breath. Without the crack, the crystal in the stone will be huge. A small Guanyin Statue? No. This crystal can be made into a 20 cm diameter crystal ball!The shop owner looked at Dong Xuebing and felt this young man was lucky beyond words. \u201cMy shop will buy this piece from you. Name a price!\u201dThe middle-aged man immediately interrupts. \u201cYoung man, I will give you a reasonable price. Don\u2019t sell it to others. Come, let\u2019s go out and discuss the price.\u201dAn acicular crystal ball was rare even at auctions. The shop owner really wanted this crystal. \u201cHow about 200,000 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing\u2019s eyes brighten up but did not say anything.The middle-aged man frowned and said: \u201c210,000 RMB!\u201dThe shop owner gritted his teeth. \u201c220,000 RMB!\u201dThe middle-aged man said without thinking. \u201c230,000 RMB!\u201dThis time, the shop owner kept quiet and shook his head disappointedly.\u201cIf this is not for my collection, I will also make sure high offer.\u201d The middle-aged man said to Dong Xuebing. \u201cAre you willing to sell for 230,000 RMB?\u201dDong Xuebing hesitated for a moment and then smiled and shook his hand. \u201cDeal.\u201dThe middle-aged man laughed. \u201cOk. I do not have so much cash with me. Can I pay you with a cheque?\u201dDong Xuebing does not know how to use a cheque. Furthermore, he can\u2019t tell the difference between a real or fake cheque. He hesitated for a while and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go to the bank together.\u201dThe man could tell Dong Xuebing was worried and nodded. \u201cOk. You can give me the crystal after the cheque is banked in. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThere was an ICBC bank near Panjiayuan.After the cheque was banked into Dong Xuebing\u2019s account and he checked the balance, Dong Xuebing gave the crystal to that man. Those two men left. But Dong Xuebing remained in the bank and banked in all his cash in his bag into his account. After that, he checked his statement. His total savings was 440,000 RMB! He took a deep breath. Words can\u2019t express his feelings!The most important thing was the discovery of a new way to use BACK!If he accumulates his power every day, and only use it in critical moments, he will be able to store a long time!Promotions? Making money? Getting married?All these dreams should not be too far.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the way home.There were still a few more stops to North Heping Street. Dong Xuebing was waiting for his bus at a bus stop outside of a shopping center near to West bridge. He had been waiting for the bus for a long time, but that did not dampen his mood. He was humming a tune as he took out the packet of Hongtashan Cigarettes from his pocket. He took out a cigarette and light it. This was the packet Dong Xuebing bought after Director Li Qing gave him a cigarette. He had opened up the pack a long time ago, and the taste of the cigarette changed. Dong Xuebing choked on the smoke and was almost in tears.The taste was awful!Dong Xuebing threw the cigarette on the floor and stepped on it to extinguish it. He also threw away that packet of Hongtashan into a bin.The bus had still not arrived. It was more than 20 minutes.Just when Dong Xuebing was considering if he should take a taxi back, he saw a familiar figure walking towards his direction from the corner of his eyes. That person was about 6 to 7 meters away. Her hair was tied up into a bun, and her facial features were beautiful. She had a slim figure and long legs. This woman was that elegant woman which Dong Xuebing had helped her to get her wallet back. She was wearing a black colored ladies suit and a pair of black heels. She was stunning. Her beauty was totally different from the gentle Qu Yunxuan. She was more of the elegant type!Dong Xuebing could not take his eyes off her. How could someone be as pretty as her?Oh, the last time we met was also not far from here. Does she stay around here? This place is quite close to my place.\u201cChief Xie!\u201d A middle-aged man appeared from another direction and walked towards that woman.That woman turned to look at him and smiled. \u201cOld Li, you have just come back?\u201dThat man nodded and smiled. \u201cI went to the parents-teachers meeting at my kid\u2019s school. Are you going out?\u201d\u201cYes. I have some on.\u201dThat man looked at her. \u201cChief Xie, can I delay your time for a while? I had asked someone to redo the thing I showed you the last time. We changed the core components to mechanical productions, and there are some other modifications\u2026\u2026\u201dThe woman smiled and waved her hand. \u201cCan we not talk about work on our off days?\u201dThe middle-aged man paused for a while: \u201cThis is still not approved by Minister Zhao\u2019s side. This\u2026\u2026\u201dThe woman was still smiling, but her eyes narrowed. \u201cBring the proposal to my office tomorrow when we are at work. Can we not talk about work now?\u201dDong Xuebing was curious. That man was in his forties. Although he was not smiling, he was standing straight unlike that woman, who was standing there casually. From their conversation, that man had addressed her politely and had used honorifics. This woman should not be more than 30 years old and should be holding a much higher position than that man. Chief Xie? Chief? Could she be some divisional chief from a private company? If she was working at a state-owned enterprise or government agency, she should be holding a similar position as Dong Xuebing in the General Affairs Office, based on her age. Although the title was \u201cChief\u201d but the actual rank was still Section Chief.Dong Xuebing saw the woman walking nearer towards him, and he hesitated and wonder if she should speak to her.This woman had said she will treat Dong Xuebing for dinner when she has the time. But almost one month had passed, and she still has not contacted Dong Xuebing. She must have forgotten about this. She might even forget how Dong Xuebing looks like.Dong Xuebing\u2019s mind was wandering when the woman suddenly stopped and looked at him.\u201cHuh? It\u2019s you?\u201dShe still remembers me? Dong Xuebing replied. \u201cHi. We meet again. You are living nearby?\u201d\u201cYes. My workplace quarters is nearby.\u201d The woman smiled. \u201cI wanted to thank you for that day and had said I will treat you to dinner. But I have been swamped. I don\u2019t even have time on weekends. I am on my way to meet clients over dinner. I\u2019m afraid that I cant treat you today.\u201dDong Xuebing looked at her pretty face and replied. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to treat me.\u201d\u201cHaha, I must give you a treat. My wallet contains lots of important cards. Identification card can be replaced if it is lost. But the name cards in my wallet cannot be replaced.\u201d The woman twirled her long hair with one finger. \u201cOh, I still do not know your name. My name is Xie Huilan.\u201d\u201cDong Xuebing.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 nice name.\u201d\u201cHuh? It\u2019s a common name. Your name sounds nicer.\u201d\u201cAre you above 25 years old this year?\u201d\u201cI am almost 24.\u201d\u201cHehe, I am older than you. I will call you Xiao Dong ok?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dThe other passengers, waiting at the bus stop, were staring at Xie Huilan. It was rare to see a woman as pretty as her.Xie Huilan laughed and chatted with Dong Xuebing for a while. After one minute of chatting, she looked at her watch and took out a piece of paper from her handbag. She wrote a string of numbers and passed it to Dong Xuebing. \u201cI got to go. This is my number. I owe you a favor. If you need any help, call me. Hmmm\u2026\u2026. I am working at the Research division of the News Bureau under the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China, Ok?\u201dDong Xuebing took the paper from her and looked at the numbers. Her handwriting was beautiful.Eh? Wait! Where was she working at?Damn! Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China? News Bureau? Research division?This Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China was different from other government departments. The research division under the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China was not a Section level department. It was a real Divisional level agency!!!Dong Xuebing was stunned. \u201cSis Xie, I heard that man called you Chief Xie earlier. You\u2026\u2026 You are the Chief of the News Bureau\u2019s Research Division?\u201dXie Huilan laughed. \u201cI\u2019m only a Deputy.\u201dEven if she was a Deputy, she was also a Deputy Divisional Chief!She was promoted every two years, or did she enter the government service earlier?It might still be possible for Xie Huilan to reach her current rank if she is in the Communist Youth League. But she is working for a department under the Central Government. She is a Deputy Divisional Chief under the Publicity Department. She is a leader from the Central Government! Although her rank might be the same as Deputy Branch Bureau Chief Xu Yan, their positions are totally different. In terms of authority and career prospects, Deputy Divisional Chief of the News Bureau, Research Department is much better compared to State Security, Deputy Branch Bureau Chief! Her position is not a position where anyone can reach with just capabilities alone!Dong Xuebing was stunned and looked at Xie Huilan\u2019s departing back view.A Deputy Divisional Chief under the age of 30? What background does she have?!Xie Huilan was pretty, elegant, have a strong backing, capable, have good career\u2026\u2026Damn!The woman was too perfect!Dong Xuebing was shocked by Xie Huilan. He thought to himself if he should also try harder? At least, he should get the rank of a Deputy Section Chief first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Qu Yunxuan was worried about her and went back with her mother. She will only return back to North Heping Street next week. Dong Xuebing had also used up his BACK on Sunday and today, he will start to accumulate again. He could not go back to gamble stones. So, Dong Xuebing focuses on his work and try not to make any mistakes. This way, he needs to save his power for emergencies.The General Affairs Office. Tan Limei, Chang Juan, and the rest were chatting.\u201cHave you heard the news? The Chief is going to be transferred.\u201d Tan Limei said softly.Chang Juan nodded: \u201cIt seems that Chief Yan will be promoted and transferred to another province\u2019s State Security Bureau.\u201dGuo Panwei interrupted. \u201cHe is going to be promoted to Provincial Deputy Director for a Southern Province.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d Chang Juan kept her eyebrow pencil in her drawer. \u201cI thought he will be transferred to a northern province.\u201dDong Xuebing, who had just entered the office, heard what they were saying. Chief Yan will be transferred away? He had heard of this rumor last week, but he ignored this. But there were so many people discussing this now. This should be true. Who will be the new Chief of this branch bureau? Will he be transferred from other branches or Political Commissar Zhou Guoan taking over this position?\u201cEh, Chief Dong.\u201d Chang Juan was the first to notice Dong Xuebing entering the office, and she immediately smiles.\u201cGood morning, Chief Dong.\u201d\u201cChief Dong.\u201dDong Xuebing likes the mood in the office, and he smiles to everyone and acknowledges their greetings. He glanced at Guo Shunjie before going into his office. Dong Xuebing still remembers how he was bullied by Guo Shunjie and how he went to Director Li Qing to snitch on him. This Guo Shunjie was too much. Dong Xuebing was already promoted to Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office, and this Guo Shunjie was still trying to backstab him. If Dong Xuebing did not have BACK, he would be in trouble with Li Qing.After pouring himself a cup of tea, Dong Xuebing thought about how he should deal with Guo Shunjie.Knock, knock, knock. Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi knocked on his office and entered.Dong Xuebing saw them: \u201cOh, Tan Zhi, Zhuang Zhi, why are you two looking so serious?\u201dZhuang Zhi blushed. \u201cBing Zhi, it like this\u2026.. Errrrrr\u2026\u2026 Errrr\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are so stupid!\u201d Tan Limei chided Zhuang Zhi and then smiles sweetly at Dong Xuebing. \u201cI will do the talking. Chief Bing Zhi, you should also know that State Security has more rules than other government agencies. For instance, if we are dating, we must report to our direct supervisor. This morning, Zhuang Zhi and I met Director Li Qing on our way to work. The first thing he said when he saw us was whether if we are dating. We know that we could not hide it anymore and we admit. He told us to report to you. I think we will be transferred to different units in a few days.\u201d Both of them could not work in the same office if they were dating.Dong Xuebing was happy for his friends. \u201cHahaha, congratulations. When is your wedding?\u201dZhuang Zhi embarrassedly replied. \u201cWe had met each other\u2019s parents a few days ago. Wedding\u2026.. it should be soon.\u201d\u201cWho says I will marry you?!\u201d Tan Limei pinched him, but she was smiling sweetly. \u201cI still need to consider.\u201dDong Xuebing laughed. \u201cOur Zhuang Zhi is an honest chap. Tan Zhi, you should not bully him like this. Even if he has thick skin, he will still feel the pain from your pinches.\u201d\u201cHehe, ok. I will listen to the Chief.\u201d After chatting for a while, Tan Limei suddenly remembers something. \u201cOh, I heard something from the Political Section earlier. This year\u2019s Western District Party School Young Cadres training course will be starting soon. This time, there will be two classes. One will be for Section Chief level, and the other is for Divisional Chief level. The course duration is 2 weeks.\u201dDong Xuebing blinked. \u201c Party school training course?\u201dTan Limei knew Dong Xuebing had only entered the bureau for less than 3 months and does not know about all these. She patiently explained to Dong Xuebing. \u201cYou should also know that our agency is different from other government agencies. They are allocated with some spots regardless of whether if it is District level or City level party school. But our agency is different. We seldom get even one place. If it wasn\u2019t for the District\u2019s Industry and Commerce Branch having some internal issues and gave up one place, our branch will not even get to participate. Even the Eastern and Northern branches do not have any spots. This is a rare opportunity, and many leaders are eyeing it.\u201dDong Xuebing have also heard of the Party School. If someone is going to be promoted, they will usually be arranged to join the training course organized by the Party School. This was to prepare someone to take on a higher position. Participating in this course is a sign of someone getting a promotion soon.Zhuang Zhi added: \u201cBing Zhi, you should try to get this spot.\u201dDong Xuebing also wanted to participate. If he participated in this course, it should not be a problem for him to be promoted to Deputy Section Chief. But he was just promoted to Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Office. Although his rank was not Deputy Section Chief, he is getting the benefits of Deputy Section Chief ranks. There was no way for him to get this spot.Tan Limei could tell what Dong Xuebing was thinking and smiles. \u201cGetting the Deputy Section Chief\u2019s benefits and entering the party school has happened before. There have been instances when staff members who were going to be promoted, joining this course. So, Chief Bing Zhi, I think you should really fight for this spot. If you can get this spot, your rank might be promoted to Deputy Section Chief when you return.\u201dDong Xuebing smiled and waved his hand. \u201cIt will be too early for me to get this rank.\u201d Dong Xuebing was tempted.He had been thinking of getting the rank of Deputy Section Chief!Ring, ring, ring\u2026\u2026The phone on Dong Xuebing rang. It was Li Qing who called. After hanging up the phone, Dong Xuebing said to Tan Limei and Zhuang Zhi. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about our work now. There will be a meeting in the afternoon in meeting room 2. I will give you the list of documents required later. Tan Zhi, I will let you and Chang Juan handle this. Girls are more careful, and there will be lesser mistakes with the documents. Hmmmm\u2026\u2026 Let Guo Shunjie go and set up the meeting room.\u201d Other than Branch Party Committee meetings, the General Affairs Office was in charge of preparing meeting materials for ordinary meetings.\u201cYes, Sir!\u201dTan Limei left and passed Dong Xuebing\u2019s instructions to others.When Guo Shunjie heard that he needs to set up the meeting venue, he stood up angrily and stormed out of the office. Setting up the meeting room was easier than preparing the documents. But this was considered a lowly task and Guo Shunjie was upset. He was cursing Dong Xuebing in his heart as he walked to Political Commissar Zhou Guoan\u2019s office. He wants to complain to Political Commissar Zhou.Zhou Guoan was in a good mood these few days and did not interrupt Guo Shunjie. He continued with his work while listening to Guo Shunjie\u2019s complains.In the end, Guo Shunjie still said: \u201cUncle Zhou, the way Dong Xuebing picks on me, clearly does not show any respect for you. He\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough.\u201d Zhou Guoan was getting frustrated from his whinings. He knocked on his desk and said: \u201cI told to that there is no hurry. I will settle everything for you. Can you have some patience?\u201dGuo Shunjie was furious. When I gave you money, you just accept it. Now, you are asking me to be patient? If this carries on, I will be ordered around by Dong Xuebing until the day I die! How can I be patient? After leaving Political Commissar Zhou\u2019s office, Guo Shunjie clenched his fist and have an evil look in his eyes!Before noon, Tan Limei and Chang Juan organized the documents and prepared 13 sets. Only 12 people were attending the meeting, but they prepared one more set as spare. Dong Xuebing took one random set and took a look. All the required information were in, and he placed the documents on the desk before leaving for lunch.At 1pm, Dong Xuebing brought the 13 sets of documents to meeting room 2 and placed all the documents neatly on the table according to the names. Actually, Dong Xuebing can ask Guo Panwei or anyone else to do this. But he had won Zhou Guoan\u2019s nomination for his current position during the last Party Committee meeting, and Chief Yan Liang will be transferring out soon. Political Commissar Zhou might be taking over his position. Dong Xuebing needs to make sure he performs well in from of Political Commissar Zhou.Suddenly, the door opened, and a few leaders entered the meeting room. Zhou Guoan was the last to arrive.\u201cPolitical Commissar Zhou, everything is ready.\u201d Dong Xuebing said.Zhou Guoan nodded and walked over to his seat.Dong Xuebing looked at Political Commissar Zhou and left the meeting room.This was only an ordinary meeting for passing the instructions from the central government. Zhou Guoan cleared his throat and opened the documents in front of him to start the meeting.5 minutes\u2026\u202610 minutes\u2026\u202620 minutes\u2026\u2026.Zhou Guoan suddenly stopped speaking when they reached page 7 of the documents!Everyone could not understand what happened and looked over.They saw Zhou Guoan flipping the documents with a long face. Bang! He threw his documents on the table!Huh? What\u2019s this?Everyone was shocked and doesn\u2019t know why Zhou Guoan suddenly got angry. They looked at the document on the table\u2026\u2026Everyone was speechless.The documents were wrong. A few pages among the documents were not even words. It was pictures of cakes and desserts! The seniors at the meeting knew Zhou Guoan had diabetes and could not eat sweet food! Everyone was looking at each other. Was this a genuine mistake or was someone trying to provoke Zhou Guoan?Who was so daring?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
