Everything was pitch-black and nothing could be seen, yet the mountains weren't completely silent. Roars of fierce beasts shook the mountains and rivers, causing countless trees to tremble. They began to rustle as leaves flew chaotically into the air.Within the endless mountains and ravines, ferocious beasts ran wildly through the great wastelands and descendants of archaic creatures roamed about. All types of terrifying sounds rose and fell within the darkness as they tried to tear this world apart.A gentle light could be vaguely seen from the mountain range. Inside the extreme darkness of tens of thousands of mountains, it flickered like the flame of a candle, as if it would die out with a moment's notice.As it gradually grew closer, an enormous and ancient tree that was on the verge of death appeared. The tree trunk was a dozen or so meters in length, and it was completely burnt black. Other than this ruined half of its trunk, there was only a single weak branch that remained; however, it was still full of vitality. The green branch and the leaves on it sparkled as if they had been carved out of green jade. Specks of gentle light began to spread out, surrounding a village.To be more precise, this was a tree that had been struck by lightning. After encountering powerful heavenly lightning many years ago, its enormous body and vigorous vitality were ruined. At this moment, only an eight or nine meter tall tree stump rose from the ground. It was terrifyingly thick, and the branch that extended out from it was like a green multicolored divine chain. A hazy light began to spread through the sky, enveloping and guarding the village within. The area of residence became hazy and indistinct, as if it was a fairyland. Within the great wasteland, it seemed extremely mysterious.All the houses inside the village were made out of stone. It was the dead of night; this place was quiet and peaceful, as if it was completely isolated from the roaring beasts of the outside darkness.Wu\u2026Gusts of fierce wind swept past. An enormous dark cloud filled the atmosphere and covered the night sky, blocking out every last speck of stellar light. As a result, the mountain range became even darker.A tyrannical bird cry rang out from above, piercing through metal and splitting open rocks. Surprisingly, this sound originated from the dark cloud, and upon closer inspection, it was actually an inconceivably large bird! As it covered the sky and concealed the moon, no one knew just how long it was.While flying over Stone Village, it looked downwards with eyes that resembled bloody moons. A heaven-overflowing vicious aura flowed about as it stared momentarily at the old willow tree. In the end, it decided to fly towards the depths of the mountain range.Silence ensued for a long period of time, and soon it was past midnight. The great earth began to tremble as an indistinct figure walked over from the distance. This figure was as tall as a mountain!An indescribable aura emanated, and the range of mountains and ravines became deathly silent. The tyrannical birds and fierce beasts all remained hidden, not daring to release the slightest bit of sound.It drew closer. This was a human shaped creature that walked upright. Its size was astonishing, comparable to a lofty mountain. There wasn't a hair on its body, and instead, dazzling golden scales covered its skin. A single vertical eye rested on an ordinary face, and as it opened and close, it was as if streak after streak of sharp lightning flew out. The creature's blood and breath surged greatly, making it seem like a demonic sovereign!It passed by this region and also glanced towards the old willow tree. After pausing momentarily, its movements suddenly became panicked. In the end, it quickly disappeared into the distance, leaving behind trembling mountains and rumbling sounds with its violent footsteps.At dawn, a ten-meter long centipede that was as thick as a bucket appeared. The dazzling silver centipede snaked its way forward. It was as if it was cast from silver, and every single section was shiny and fierce. As it slid past mountain rocks, kengqiang sounds would rise as sparks flew. However, it ultimately avoided Stone Village and did not intrude. As the black mist surged in all directions, all types of creatures were forced to retreat.A weak branch was releasing lustrous green multicolored lights as it gently swayed in the wind...Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Perfect WorldCH 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 1 \u2013 Full of LifeStone Village was located within a vast mountain range. All around it were tall peaks and huge ravines, and endless groups of mountains towered over.The sunlight passed through the dyed clouds, and it scattered a golden radiance as the people warmly bathed within.Dozens of children gathered together in\u00a0a group, and the\u00a0ages varied from 4 years old\u00a0to those over 10 years old. They faced the sunlight in an empty courtyard in front of the village, and were training their bodies with hmph\u00a0and\u00a0ha\u00a0sounds. The young and tender little faces were all serious. The older children gave off a power like that of a\u00a0tiger\u2019s, while the younger ones still practiced with good form and style.A middle-aged man with a body as well-built as a tiger or leopard wore clothing made from beasts. The color of his skin was like copper, and his black hair was spread over his shoulders. His bright and lively eyes scanned\u00a0over every single child, and he sternly gave out instructions.\u201cWhen the sun rises, all living things begin to move, and the air of life is the most vigorous at that time. Although we cannot take the sunlight as meals and eat air like in the legends, there are still great benefits by training oneself while facing the sun as\u00a0it can fill one\u2019s body with energy. A day\u2019s plan depends on the morning. Every day, rise early, and work hard. Strengthen your muscles, tendons, bones, and circulate your blood. You must do that to survive in this vast mountain range.\u201d The middle-aged man who stood at the front and instructed the group of children had a face of strictness. He seriously warned, then yelled, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\u201cWe understand!\u201d The group of children had plenty of vitality as they loudly replied.There were many appearances of prehistoric lifeforms within the mountains. Occasionally, huge wings that covered the sky would pass over and cast giant shadows on the ground. There were also some desolate beasts who stood\u00a0on mountain peaks, howling after swallowing the moon. Of course, the various types of poisonous insects moving about could not be forgotten, as they were also abnormally terrifying.\u201cUnderstand!\u201d The little guy, who was clearly distracted and was half a beat slower, babyishly yelled out.It was a very young child, roughly\u00a01 or 2 years old. After learning how to walk for barely a few months, he had already begun to train with everyone else. Obviously, he went over by himself and mixed himself along with the older children, and was clearly not supposed to appear in that group.Hmph hmph ha heh!\u00a0The little guy\u00a0made sounds from his mouth, and his tender little hands tried their best to wave around. He tried to imitate the older children\u2019s movements, but he was too small and young. His movements were slanted and twisted, and his steps were unstable as he staggered around. In addition, there were white-colored milk stains on the corners of his mouth, making him\u00a0appear\u00a0quite foolish.A group of older children were looking at him, and all of them were moving their eyebrows and eyes, causing the atmosphere of the originally strict morning exercises to relax.The little guy\u00a0was quite beautiful with his white and tender skin as well as\u00a0his big, black revolving eyes.\u00a0His entire body\u00a0looked like a porcelain doll, causing him to look quite cute. His young and tender movement and the\u00a0yi yi ya ya\u00a0sounds coming from his mouth made him seem lovable and\u00a0naive. Within another piece of land, some older people who sat cross-legged on huge rocks while\u00a0breathing in and out also revealed smiles.Even the male adults who were robust and half naked\u00a0with\u00a0shiny muscles also looked over with smiles. They were the strongest people in the village, and they were also the most important powers who hunted and guarded the village. They were also training. Someone held a big bone club from an unknown huge beast\u2019s skeleton, and there was also another person who held a black-colored, metal-casted broadsword. He powerfully waved it, and the noise created from the wind was like thunder.Their living environment\u00a0was extremely nasty, and because there were various floods, fierce beasts, poisonous insects, and difficulty in\u00a0gathering\u00a0food for survival, many males died in the wilderness before they even matured. If one wanted to live, they could only strengthen themselves and work hard in the morning. No matter if it was adults, or elders, or children, it was a habit that was formed since they were young.\u201cConcentrate!\u201d The middle-aged man who was responsible for supervising and instructing the children\u2019s training loudly yelled. The group of children hurriedly went back to being serious, and they continued to train in the soft and dazzling morning sunlight.\u201cHuu\u2026yiya\u2026Tired.\u201d The little guy\u00a0exhaled, then he sat down on the ground as he looked at the training of the older children. However, after a while, his attention shifted. He stood up, and while staggering, he rushed towards a five-colored sparrow that\u00a0was jumping and bouncing around nearby. At the end, it did not go well. He fell on his butt a few times, but he did not cry. As he huffed, he climbed back up to chase again with hmphs\u00a0and\u00a0sighs.\u201cOkay, stop!\u201dFollowing a loud shout, every single child cheered for a while. They massaged their aching hands and feet, then while shouting,\u00a0they separated and charged towards their own homes to eat breakfast.The older villagers\u00a0all smiled as they climbed\u00a0down\u00a0from the huge rocks. As for the adults who were as well-built as tigers, they also laughed and some of them followed their own children back home as they held their bone clubs and broadswords.Stone Village was not too big. There were around 300 people if you added up the old and\u00a0young males\u00a0and females. The houses were made out of huge stones, and they were plain and natural.At the front of the village, there was a huge tree which that had been\u00a0struck by lightning, and it had a diameter of a dozen meters or so. At that moment, the light from the only willow\u00a0branch remaining\u00a0on the tree was already being concealed by the morning sunlight, and it became quite ordinary.\u201cOh? You have Dirt Dragon meat? Hand me some!\u201dSome children were lively and restless, and as they ate, they didn\u2019t have much etiquette. Many of them came out from their homes to gather together while hugging their pottery bowls.Grass and trees flourished around Stone Village, and although there were many fierce beasts, they had guards protecting them from\u00a0the big mountain. The amount of food\u00a0was not that abundant for the villagers. They only had some rough wheat bread, wild fruits, and rare meat in the children\u2019s bowls.In fact, insufficient food was always a very serious problem for\u00a0Stone Village. The mountain range was extremely dangerous, and the abnormal beasts and fierce birds were too strong and terrifying. Every time they went out to hunt, it was possible that someone would lose their life.If there was a choice, the villagers would not be willing to enter the mountains, because entering the mountain indicted blood and sacrifices.To them, food was always extremely precious, and wasting was not allowed. Every single child were taught\u00a0that since they were young. Hunger. Food. Hunting. Life. Blood. They were all interconnected.The courtyard of the old chief, Shi Yunfeng, was located at the front of the village. It was pieced together by huge stones, then tightened up with huge burnt willow wood. Within the courtyard and in front of the kitchen, a white-colored liquid inside a pottery pot was boiling. The fragrance of the milk pounced towards one\u2019s nose, and the little guy\u00a0was currently simmering milk from beasts. Other than that, occasionally, he threw some medical herbs in and slowly stirred it with a wooden ladle.After a short while, the old man yelled, \u201cLittle guy, come over and eat!\u201dThe little guy\u00a0lost his parents when he was half a year old, so he grew up by drinking the milk of beasts. At that moment, he was already one year and a few months old. If he was a normal child, he should have already weaned, yet he still drank the milk quite deliciously. He was unwilling to stop drinking the milk, so he was teased by some older children.\u201cYiya, hu\u2026I can\u2019t run anymore\u2026\u201d He kept\u00a0persistently chasing after the five-colored sparrow, and he was already out of breath. At that instant, he fell and sat on the floor.\u201cLittle guy, drink your milk!\u201d A bunch of older children clamored together.\u201cYou little monkeys, didn\u2019t all of you also pass through his age?\u201d The old chief smiled and reprimanded them.\u201cBut we didn\u2019t still drink milk at the age of one and a half!\u00a0Hehe..\u201dThe little guy made a silly smile\u00a0as he faced the teasing of the older children. His big, bright, and black eyes squinted into a crescent moon and he didn\u2019t seem to mind. He sat in front of the pot and scooped with the wooden ladle, drinking\u00a0the milk quite delightfully.After breakfast, several extremely aged old people in the village gathered in the courtyard of the chief, Shi Yunfeng. Although their hairs had all turned white, they were still very vigorous.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong recently. Late last\u00a0night, a giant creature passed by and created a massive disturbance. Something must have happened deep within the mountain range.\u201d\u201cMm. I woke up from my sleep a few times last night, and my skin and bones were chilly. Undoubtedly, some cruel beasts or huge insects must have passed by.\u201dSeveral old people spoke one after another. They were either frowning or in deep contemplation. They discussed some hints of danger recently, and they felt that something different happened.\u201cI feel that in the deep wilderness, something impressive must have appeared to attract the attention of the surrounding areas or ancient remains, so all of them quickly went over,\u201d said chief Shi Yunfeng after thinking.\u201cA mountain treasure wouldn\u2019t have appeared right?\u201d Another old person instantly widened his eyes. His hair and beard all stood up, and he expressed his surprise.Others also expressed unusual expressions and their gazes were burning, however, they quickly put out the flames in their eyes. Things like those were not something that they could get. No one would enter the deepest parts of the faraway mountain range.For all these years, not a single person was able to survive after entering such a place. All sorts of overpowering things appeared within the mountains, and even if every single person in Stone Village went in together, they wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish anything.\u201cChief, we haven\u2019t entered the mountain in quite a few days.\u201d Just at that time, a powerful adult male walked into the courtyard. He was the leader of the hunting team, and he was also the chief who was going to serve Stone Village next.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been too peaceful recently.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng furrowed his brows.\u201cBut there really isn\u2019t much food left.\u201d Shi Linhu said. His build was extremely tall and big, being over\u00a0two meters tall. He carried a broadsword that weighted 300 jin\u00a0or so, and his entire figure looked like a human-shaped bear. Chunks of copper-colored muscles were all over his body, and they were moving around like a python.\u201cThe little ones\u00a0need to grow and they cannot starve. We must think of some methods,\u201d\u00a0spoke an elder.\u201cAlthough it isn\u2019t too peaceful and quiet at night here, on the other hand, there aren\u2019t many abnormalities in the day. I\u2019ll bring some people out, and there shouldn\u2019t be many problems if we are careful.\u201d Shi Linhu said.In\u00a0the end, dozens of males at their prime gathered at the front of the village. The chief, Shi Yunfeng, brought them in front of the lightning-struck wood and seriously prayed towards the old willow tree.\u201cGuardian spirit, please protect my clan members, let them hunt some plump prey for the children, and safely\u00a0return. With devout hearts, we offer sacrifices and offerings to you for generations to come.\u201dShi = StonePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many women and children also quickly rushed over, silently praying that the relatives who were about to go\u00a0hunting would come back safely.The mountain range was simply too dangerous. It was a completely different world outside once one\u00a0left the protection of the village and the willow tree; it was one filled with terrifying birds of prey and huge beasts.And just like that, the village\u2019s strongest group of individuals, carrying giant bows and broadswords on their backs, set off and entered the mountain valleys, creeks and huge lakes. Momentarily after, there was a large waft of a desolate smell.Watching as the hunting group left, the old chief Shi Yunfeng led the group of children towards the grass patch located at\u00a0the entrance of the village. He sat cross-legged and said, \u201cAlright, you little group of monkeys need to sit down and study hard.\u201dThe group of children immediately became distressed and all of them had dispirited expressions. They reluctantly sat down, as if they were wilted leaves.\u201cGrandpa chief, those bird languages and turtle writings are complicated like hobgoblin symbols. It\u2019s too hard to learn. What is the point of studying it?\u201d\u201cExactly, it\u2019s not as useful as the archery my father taught me!\u201dThe group of children all had sour expressions on their faces, and they all felt conflicted.\u201cYou group of little babies really don\u2019t know anything. The Bone Text consists of tyrannical symbols on bones that were passed down naturally by terrifying Archaic Descendants. Embedded within are\u00a0mysterious forces in which many people could not learn even if they wanted to. Even if you are just somewhat successful in learning it, who knows how many times stronger you would be compared to your parents.\u201d The old chief criticized them for not meeting his expectations.\u201cGrandpa chief, demonstrate for us the power of this Bone Text.\u201d A slightly older child spoke.\u201cLittle guy,\u00a0come here.\u201d The chief shouted from afar.The little guy\u00a0had just finished chasing after the five-colored sparrow, and was currently putting a lot of energy into pulling a big yellow dog\u2019s tail. Turning his head in confusion, he released his grip and ran over while shaking his buttocks. Opening his big bright eyes, he said, \u201cYiya Yiya, Grandpa chief what do you need?\u201d\u201cI want you to use the things I taught you from the Bone Text.\u201d Shi Yunfeng said.\u201cOkay.\u201d The little guy\u00a0was very obedient, and stretched out his two little hands. He closed his mouth, and his entire body was constantly using energy, causing\u00a0his little face to become red.With a\u00a0Weng\u00a0sound, his palms emitted a bright light, and a strange character emerged. It looked like it was made out of casted metal, and it possessed a metallic luster. Soon after, it appeared on his other hand as well.The little guy\u00a0walked up a few steps, and lifted up a boulder that was taller than him.\u201cSo powerful!\u201d Exclaimed the group of children. This was the\u00a0little guy who was a bit older than one. How could he possibly lift up such a big rock?\u201cLittle guy,\u00a0did you use all of the strength you got from drinking milk?\u201d The older kids all teased him.\u201cYiya,\u00a0yes, I used up all my strength.\u201d The little guy\u00a0dropped the stone and sat his butt down on the floor and smiled without a hint of worry. He was extremely pure, and quickly, the characters faded from his palms.\u201cGrandpa chief, is this the power from that mysterious Bone Text that you studied for more than ten years?\u201d The group of children\u2019s eyes were all shining, and their previous lack of interest no longer existed.\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, this can only be considered the basics. Compared to the Heavenly Bone Text that appeared in legends, it is still too far off.\u201d The old man nodded, then shook his head.\u201cCan Grandpa chief tell us about the outside world?\u201d The group of children had hopeful expressions.Everyone within the village knew that when the chief was younger, he left with roughly a dozen individuals for the distant mother earth\u2019s limits and explored the outer world.However ten years ago, only two managed to come back while drenched in blood. One of the two died soon after, and only Shi Yunfeng was able to survive.He spent these past years studying the Bone Text, and from time to time he would test it out on the strong individuals within the village. These kids all knew clearly that when their parents, who were like tigers and dragons, were called over, they would all make howls and shouts that made hearts tremble within the stone courtyard. This made these children feel worried, yet\u00a0at the same time admiration.Only in recent years had the old chief\u2019s research gradually begun\u00a0to lessen, no longer frightening the village\u2019s residents. Moreover, that little guy\u00a0who drank the milk of wild beasts was raised by him, and he became\u00a0his best research candidate.\u201cThe outside world\u2026\u201d The old man began to reminisce. After being spellbound with regret, he said, \u201cThe world is too big. It\u2019s vast and boundless. Just from one region to the next would cover millions of li . No one really knows how vast it was, as a person walking on foot would not completely cover a single region in their lifetime; it is simply boundless and desolate. Different regions\u2019 residents would find it extremely difficult to contact and communicate with each other because it is simply\u00a0too dangerous. The land has too many different tyrannical beast species, and they are\u00a0all formidable and mysterious. Regardless of whether\u00a0it was\u00a0a tribe of several hundred thousand or a magnificent and enormous city, there was still a chance that they would be destroyed overnight by some ancient species. Of course, there were still humans who were unimaginably powerful and comparable to that of Archaic Descendants. They possessed matchless divine power, and these humans were the most gifted ones amongst the human race.The group of children all felt reverence within their hearts, and at the same time, they felt a sense of yearning as they were all curious about the outside world. Someone asked, \u201cWithin this land, are there any earthly gems or legendary elixirs that could enable one to undergo rebirth? Also, the human race\u2019s strongest geniuses, how strong are they exactly?\u201dThe old man laughed and said, \u201cIf you want to know, then you must first become strong.\u201d\u201cIf we can master the Bone Text\u2019s mysterious power, would we be able to explore\u00a0the regions under the sky?\u201d Some of the children began to reveal their yearning.Shi Yunfeng petted a child\u2019s head before saying, \u201cNot mentioning other regions, anyone able to travel across half of this region\u00a0can\u00a0already be considered incredible!\u201dAll of the children were dumbstruck.\u201cAll I can do is guide you towards the correct path,\u00a0however,\u00a0where you end up in the end will depend on you. The things I have taught\u00a0you should not be inferior to the things taught to children of similar ages in the outside world.\u201d When the old man finished what he was saying, his eyes revealed a different light, and he rubbed the exotic jade bone in his bosom.The group of children who sat in a circle around the old chief finally concentrated and began to focus on the lecture. Only at noon did they finally disperse.\u201cIt\u2019s too hard. Chief actually said that it required a few years for the Bone Text to slightly enter one\u2019s body. In addition, most people won\u2019t ever\u00a0succeed at it.\u201d\u201cBut that pea-sized\u00a0little guy\u00a0actually did it.\u201dThe little guy\u00a0innocently blinked his eyes, and then once again began to pull at the tail of that big yellow dog, and the big yellow dog began to bark innocently.The sun began to set in the west, and under the sunset\u2019s afterglow, the entire Stone Village was infected with a faint golden sheet of brilliance. In the distance, various apes and lions cried out, and a large number of stone houses at this moment were like divine ancient temples, holy and peaceful.Roughly a dozen people gathered at the horizon, and their shadows were being stretched out by the setting sun. Their bodies\u2019 outlines appeared golden within the sunset glow, making them appear incomparably tall and powerful. They were each\u00a0dragging the head of an enormous and ferocious beast as they returned from their bountiful journeys.\u201cThey\u2019re back!\u201d The village\u2019s women and children who stood at the village entrance waiting for a long time burst out in cheers, and the uneasiness and fear within their hearts vanished at once. They shouted in a loud voice.\u201cFather and the others returned safe and sound!\u201d\u201cHeavens! To come back with so much prey. This time we reaped a rare and great harvest!\u201dThe hunt this time was extremely successful, and the dozen grown men all returned with their good harvest. Within the prey was the enormous body of a Dragon Horned Elephant, which was a beast with excessive meat similar to that of a cow. Furthermore, the buckets were filled with thick and thin Flying Pythons\u2026The old folk within the village all had shocked expressions on their faces. These beings were normally very hard to deal with, and some of them were even called fierce beasts. For so many of them to be hunted today and covered in blood, it was simply too unexpected.Take for example that Dragon Horned Elephant. The elephant\u2019s body was like that of metal, and it was difficult for even iron spears to pierce through. The pair of Dragon Horns were sharp like knives, easily splitting apart\u00a0boulders. For that one-legged Kui beast, if it managed to make its way up close, it could shock people straight to death. As for those Flying Pythons born with enormous wings, they were known as mountain killers. They would leave the mountain tops and abruptly dive down to\u00a0kill, causing them to be extremely terrifying.Within the prey were some beings that were even more formidable, such as the scarlet bodied Two-Headed Flame Rhinoceros, which was an impure blooded mythical creature\u2026 these were all genuine fierce beasts. If they happened to meet one of them, they would normally take long detours to avoid them, and yet they were able to hunt them today, completely defying common sense.\u201cThis time we really were\u00a0extremely lucky to return from such a rewarding journey without a single casualty,\u201d laughed Shi Linghu, the leader of the hunting group,\u00a0as he explained to the chief and villagers. During these past few nights, there were many supreme enormous beasts passing through the mountains, moving the earth and shaking the mountains. They trampled everything to death, and harmed many mountain beasts. During these past few days, many\u00a0fierce beasts were hurt, and those heavily injured beasts were pursued and hunted by them, becoming easy prey. These were all tyrannical creatures that the village men would normally run away from.\u201cThe enormous footprints within the mountains were similar to those of humans, but they were simply too huge, with each of them nearly 100 meters long!\u201d\u201cThat large?!\u201d Exclaimed the village members. This really was shocking news.Even the Elders who heard this could not help but draw in a breath of cold air. They were increasingly realizing that something happened within the mountain range abyss that\u00a0ended up attracting the Archaic Descendants around the large desolate areas.In any case, it was a one-time plentiful harvest, and everyone was full of happiness. Stone Village was filled with the sound of children\u2019s laughter and the atmosphere was joyful.Chief Shi Yunfeng brought the group of people to the willow tree and brought the dozen dead enormous beasts to the stone platform that was clearly a large altar.Li is a Chinese mile equivalent to roughly 500 metersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was quite wide, and its establishment neighbored the old and broken willow tree. Upon it lied a small mountain of fierce beasts.Sanguine beast blood dyed the large stone platform scarlet as it trickled along the engravings on the face of the stone. A brilliant red shone on the tough and long beasts\u2019 fur, and cold light flickering on their scales malevolent horns as well. It was a horrifying scene that shook one\u2019s heart, and there was a bitter desolate air assaulting everyone\u2019s nostrils.Under the guidance of the old Chief, Stone Village\u2019s residents all gathered to pray and request for the Willow Tree\u2019s protection. This was a solemn event of offering sacrifices, as well as a type of usual practice. This was carried out each time a hunt ended.The scorched black tree\u2019s body stayed just as quiet as before, as if it didn\u2019t react in the slightest. It never used the offerings as always, but some of the village residents knew that it actually had a spirit!Finally, the sacrificial procedures were finished. The villagers all released a large breath of air and once again happily smiled. They began to move the bodies of those fierce beasts in preparation of draining their blood and cutting them up.\u201cMany years have passed already, yet the guardian spirit\u00a0hasn\u2019t moved once after our offerings. Do we still need to offer sacrifices every time?\u201d A youngster murmured in a low voice.\u201cYou stinky brat, what kind of garbage are you spouting!\u201d His father\u2019s bronze eyes opened wide, and lifted his huge palm-leaf hands to beat him.The old Chief gestured with his hands and stopped him from doing so. In a soft voice, he said, \u201cWe have offered sacrifices towards this guardian\u00a0spirit, and it has provided for us. Only by remembering it sincerely within our hearts and treating it piously would it guard, bless and protect our village.\u201dThe youngster\u2019s face was completely red, and in hurriedly replied, \u201cChief, it\u2019s not that my heart is not sincere. It\u2019s just that I think that the guardian spirit does not really need all of these offerings, as it has never moved or utilized them.\u201d\u201cAs long as your intent is good then that\u2019s enough.\u201d Shi Yunfeng patted his shoulders, and carefully explained.The guardian spirit was also called the \u2018Spirit of Sacrifice\u2019. It was an abbreviation for the tribe\u2019s \u2018Spirit of Sacrifice and Support\u2019. It protected the village, and it intimidated the great desolate area\u2019s vicious beasts, keeping them away.The village\u2019s Elder still remembered that this same guardian spirit was not quite the same ten years ago. There was instead a rather strange rock, and each time, the offerings would quickly lose more than half its blood essence from its absorption.One day deep into the night, however, the old willow came, and that block of stone decided to go far away, and everything completely changed after that.Thinking back to that rainy night, the old chief felt slightly distracted. That was when he was still a young youth, and at that time saw for himself that shocking and frightening scene.During that late night, lightning flashed and thunder roared, and the heavy rainstorm was majestic. The rainstorm was violent till its utmost limits, and the mountains were heavily battered by the thunder and lightning. The mountain torrent seemed like an ocean, and vicious beasts were running away frantically like the tides; the scene was terrifying.And right at that time, a large willow tree broke through the boundary of the heavens and appeared within the clouds. It bathed in the sea of thunder, and allowed the lighting from the mountains to course through itself. Tens of thousands of willow branches formed strips of burning divine chains and pierced into the heavens as if it was battling somethingFinally, the large willow tree snapped, and its entire body was charred black. It was reduced to its current size before it fell down and took root within Stone Village. At that time, the lightning disappeared, and the downpour of torrential rain retreated. That night, the stone that the villagers sacrificed to and received supply from left.Every time he recalled this scene, the old chief would always feel his heart tremble. The old willow tree was not created from a random root within the mountains, but rather descended from the heavens. The reason it was damaged was due to the endless seas of thunder, and within the village, not many people knew about this.In its first ten years, its entire body was scorched black and didn\u2019t have a single hint of life force. It appeared as if it was completely dead, and only ten years ago did it finally show a single tender green branch. Since then, it has yet to undergo another change.\u2018Stinky brats, you all should be careful. We rarely reap such good harvests of vicious beasts. Their blood essence, muscles, vessels as well as parts of their bones are all extraordinarily precious, so don\u2019t waste their precious properties.\u201d The old chief warned.The villagers in their prime chopped with silver knives. While they were disassembling the giant creatures, there were sonorous sounds as sparks flew everywhere from hitting the giant creatures\u2019 shockingly hard skeletons.Someone had prepared a large jar long in advance to collect the special blood essence from within the beast\u2019s body. This was a refined blood medicine, extremely rare and precious.Among this pile of beast corpses, the most precious one was the Pi Xiu . Although it was just a descendant and was quite far from a pure-blooded Pi Xiu King, it still possessed a portion of the true blood that had astonishing value.It has already been two years since they last caught a mythical beast type like the Pi Xiu, as they were excessively savage and large. As single swipe from their claws would easily take the life of a strong individual, making them simply too horrifying to handle.One could say that the harvest this time was so luxurious it made them speechless.\u201cWu, the true blood flowing from the Two-Headed Flame Rhinoceros\u2019s horn really is quite extraordinary. It\u2019s not inferior to the Pi Xiu at all!\u201d An older grandpa personally used his knife to remove the rhinoceros horn from the flesh. It was as tough as metal and stone, and from that area dripped out a gush of scarlet-red true blood, making the carcass look like it was releasing fiery light.Suddenly, the blood unexpectedly changed into a clump of red radiance, and a palm-length Two-Headed Flame Rhinoceros appeared before everyone\u2019s eyes. Its entire body was scarlet red, and it was vivid and lifelike as it let out an angry roar.\u201cGood stuff. This true blood\u2019s medicinal qualities are extremely strong, and are not inferior to those of mythical beasts!\u201d The old grandpa who held the knife laughed heartily, and quickly utilized that jar to collect that rhinoceros blood before firmly closing the jar cover.\u201cChief, this Dragon Horned Elephant\u2019s horn is also good stuff. When we found it, it was already close to dying. Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle it.\u201d A youth spoke.Shi Yunfeng nodded and said, \u201cIt really is quite a rare sight. The dragon horn growing on its head has already matured. Once it is carefully extracted, it can be used as a precious medicine that can repair bones.\u201d\u201cThe one-legged demon beast\u2019s leg has really tough and durable strips of muscles. Even axes cannot chop through it.\u201d\u201cThis is all good stuff. You stinky youngsters need to be careful, don\u2019t let the precious blood from the Flying Python\u2019s two wings go to waste!\u201dThe villagers were all happy, and their faces were full of smiles.Only the children withdrew their necks before quickly disappearing. They knew that the majority of these blood and bone medicines would be used on their bodies, causing them to once again need to \u2018suffer\u2019.Only after an entire half day passed did the precious treasure growing from the fierce beasts\u2019 bodies get plucked clean. The Chief as well as several other elders nodded their heads in satisfaction before collecting the jars and storing them.\u201cThere is so much prey. In a little while, we should preserve a portion, and afterwards smoke them and make it into meat jerky.\u201d Some of the experienced elders were saying.With the fierce beasts piled up like a small mountain, the villagers could not finish it even after many days. If they simply allowed it to rot, then it would be too much of a waste. For the villages that have faced food shortages, there was no way they would permit that.The women from each of the households came up to divide the meat. All of them had sincere smiles on their faces, since previously they felt anxious with all the men outside. Now that they all returned peacefully and with such a luxurious harvest, it was truly one of heaven\u2019s best gifts.Smoke rose in spirals from the households\u2019 chimneys, and after half an hour, the fragrant smell of meat began to spread. The households\u2019 iron pots had almost finished stewing the meat chunks until they were soft, and the children couldn\u2019t wait any longer. In addition, the beast meat roasting atop the bonfires were also beginning to develop a golden and oily luster, and as the oil dripped onto the fire, sputtering noises were created. Those sturdy men all could not hold themselves back any longer, and began to tear off strips of meat. With big appetites, they bit into the meat, releasing a mouthful of juices.\u201cSmall child, this is Pi Xiu meat. Eating a lot of it will give you big strength. It\u2019s truly a rare type of meat.\u201d\u201cStinky youngster, eat more, this is meat from the Two-Headed Flame Rhinoceros. Eating more of it can help your skin and bone become tough like iron, so stop eating that useless Tree Pig meat.\u201dAll types of different fierce beasts made up the villagers rich evening meal. The enticing meat fragrance wafted through the streets, drawing in the appetites of the residents as waves of merry laughter rang throughout the festive village.Pi Xiu:Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Males and females,\u00a0both young and old,\u00a0all had smiles on their faces. They were all filled with cheer while talking and laughing.\u201cLittle children, don\u2019t run about carelessly. We are about to conduct the medicinal bath soon. Sleep well at night, and in the future you would definitely be stronger than all of the vicious beasts,\u201d said and elder while laughing.\u201cAww\u2026 I don\u2019t want to!\u201d The group of kids who heard this all stood up and screamed miserably, running away and hiding within different parts of the village.\u201cYou bunch of melon babies, you really do not know what is good fortune. These are rare tonics! If we could have this medicinal bath continuously, your muscles and bones would be able to match that of those giant creatures.\u201d The adults all criticized them, and like grabbing little chicks, they began to catch their children.\u201cIt hurts, I don\u2019t want to go into the medicinal bath. Last time, it felt like I was getting cut by blades.\u201d\u201cDad, let go, I don\u2019t want to be boiled.\u201dThe group of children intensely resisted, but their small arms were no match for the adults\u2019 strength. In the end, they all were\u00a0all\u00a0caught.Inside of an empty space within the village, eight large copper cauldrons had been previously\u00a0set up. The inferno below them raged, and the liquid within the cauldron was boiling. Several elders threw stalk after stalk of medicinal herbs inside, and from time to time, they would also put in foot long centipedes and fist sized spiders. This made the originally clear liquid dark and cloudy as if it was ink; it was extremely frightening.The faces of the group of children all turned green. They all wanted to escape and run away, but they were all helplessly held in place by the adults.Soon after, a few\u00a0villagers arrived with ten jars. Several elders gently and carefully opened them before pouring the dark red liquid into the large copper cauldrons, causing the dark black liquid to boil even more furiously.This was the scarce true blood from the slain vicious beasts\u2019 bodies. It was extremely precious, and regardless of whether it\u00a0was an adult or a child using it, they would all gain tremendous benefits, enhancing their physiques. In addition, with the villager\u2019s understanding of several ancient prescriptions, as well as adding some medicinal herbs etc., this true blood could become even more effective.Besides the true blood, several elders also used the Flying Pythons\u2019 wing bones, the One-legged beast\u2019s foot bone, as well as several other materials and pulverized them with a great deal of effort before tossing them into the boiling water.When the fire died out and the cauldron\u2019s contents no longer boiled, the water temperature finally somewhat dropped in temperature. Screams along with\u00a0putong putong\u00a0sounds rang out as the first batch of kids were thrown inside, and each cauldron held roughly two or three individuals.\u201cIt hurts, this water can completely cook us alive.\u201d\u201cSave me, my body feels like it\u2019s being cut by blades, and my skin and flesh are being split open!\u201dThey were all grimacing in pain, and their hands grabbing their legs. One by one they all rushed for the outside, only to be pushed back inside as they endlessly screamed.In this way, the several dozen kids were thrown in batches into the cauldrons. The majority viciously howled, and struggled constantly. Only seven or eight kids were somewhat better, and\u00a0although they were aching and their brows were soaked in sweat, they endured it and didn\u2019t utter a single word.As for\u00a0the little guy, he couldn\u2019t escape either and was thrown into a cauldron with special treatment\u00a0by himself. Only a little bit of clear water was added to the cauldron, but other than that, all of it was true blood and broken down bones.The villagers did not feel that this was inappropriate, and did not feel that they were favoring him over others either. This was because their own children already couldn\u2019t\u00a0withstand the pain and were crying out heart-tearing screams inside the normal medicinal cauldron, but this little guy\u00a0could actually handle it.In addition, when the little guy\u00a0was within the black cauldron\u2019s thick and boiling liquid, the old chief even opened up two special jars, and poured the contents into the cauldron.Pouring out of one of the jars was a scarlet cloud that formed a palm-sized Pi Xiu. It was mighty and malevolent as if it was about to tear everyone apart\u00a0and escape, and its nature was extremely vicious. From within Shi Yunfeng\u2019s palms shone a character, and the bone text began to rise. A slap made the Pi Xiu scatter and turn into blood, and it dripped into the cauldron.From that other jar rushed out a scarlet red Two-headed Flame Rhinoceros. It was terrifyingly brilliant, and with its head high it angrily hissed, and was similarly released into the black cauldron by the old chief.When the temperature slightly dropped, the little guy\u00a0was picked up and directly thrown into the cauldron while struggling. Because he was still little, he would choke on the water when sitting inside, so just as he fell inside with a\u00a0gudong gudong\u00a0sounds, he immediately drank several mouthfuls of the liquid.The other children all showed sympathetic expressions towards him and suddenly felt quite fortunate. There was only a little water added, and the main portion was the special true blood, beast bone as well as muscle lumps that formed the medicinal liquid. This medicinal liquid would definitely make one\u2019s skin and bones feel even more pain; the little guy\u00a0was truly pitiful.Even some adults couldn\u2019t bear it.\u00a0The\u00a0little guy was exerting as much strength as he could muster while struggling and\u00a0grimacing in pain, and from time to time, he would even drink mouthfuls of the viscous fluid. The adults watching really\u00a0began to feel quite worried.\u201cThere\u2019s no problem since it\u2019s not his first time. Since he could do this before, then he could live past this as well. Drinking more of the medicinal liquid is not bad either, if he can absorb it, it\u2019ll allow him to absorb great benefits.\u201d The old chief spoke, as his care for the little guy\u2019s health was quite expansive.\u201cHis constitution is quite strong, and the Bone Text\u2019s mysterious power might also be at work here by helping him refine part of the medicinal strength. The little guy\u00a0should not feel that much pain.\u201d \u00a0Another elder spoke while stroking his beard.The medicinal bath continued for quite a while, and the group of children were soaked until they looked like red monkeys. All of them looked rather miserable, and while looking at each other, tears dripped down with\u00a0hua hua\u00a0sounds. Only when the medicinal bath finish did they stop sobbing and finally feel relief.While within the black cauldron, the little guy\u00a0did not cry. His big eyes were looking around, and his face had a bit of a red blush, resembling a big apple. When he was lifted out, he looked as if he was drunk, swaying back and forth.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d An elder asked.The little guy burped, and said muddle-headedly, \u201cI drank a lot, full now.\u201dHearing this kind of simple-minded and pure response, the adults were all provoked into laughter.\u201cTired.\u201d The little guy\u00a0staggered from side to side, and his little body fell into Shi Yunfeng\u2019s embrace. He lightly mumbled something and slightly squeaked before sinking into deep sleep.\u201cBring these children back and let them sleep well. By tomorrow, their strength should have increased by a significant amount.\u201d Said chief Shi Yunfeng.Finally, several elders put away the leftover liquid. They didn\u2019t let it go to waste, but rather once again lit up the copper cauldron with fire and added some more medicinal herbs. They were going to cook until the medicine dried up and became medicinal power. Not only was this a type of tonic, but it was also a type of precious healing medicine. Bringing it along for the mountain range hunts could save lives.With vile environments and difficult to hunt magical beasts, true blood really was rare and precious. They couldn\u2019t afford to dispose such precious medicinal powder even after it was used by the children, and\u00a0weren\u2019t willing to\u00a0waste any of it at all.Naturally, the strongest villagers all didn\u2019t care about this, since as long as it could close up a wound and save their lives, it was enough.That night, all the children slept deeply. The next morning, many of these little guys were\u00a0crying out loudly, as the old skin was being shed off in chunks, making their beds filthy.\u201cGo, get a bucket of water and wash yourselves clean. Afterwards, lift that lump of millstone.\u201d\u201cDad, that is what third brother uses to train his strength, how could I possibly lift that up?\u201d\u201cStop speaking nonsense, if I tell you to lift, then just lift. Are you telling me that we wasted all that true blood and bone medicine last night for nothing? If you really didn\u2019t make any progress, then I\u2019ll spank your butt until it turns into eight fragments!\u201dEarly the next morning, Stone Village was active like birds flying and dogs jumping. All of the children were forced to move large rocks and copper cauldrons as they whined repeatedly.The results were clearly obvious. The children all gained a significant amount of strength, and their physiques revealed an increase in power. However, if one were to say that they were reborn, then that was still a bit far from reality.Kacha kacha!The village head, chief Shi Yunfeng\u2019s palm symbol glowed a brilliant light, and within his hand was the shaft of an golden-alloyed hammer. With it, he smashed the most precious part of the Dragon Horned Elephant\u2019s dragon horn into pieces. Following that, he retrieved\u00a0a portion of the Pi Xiu\u2019s amputated claw bone\u00a0as well as a small section of the Flame Rhinoceros\u2019 red horn, and\u00a0similarly pulverized them until they\u00a0became fine powder. He then mixed these crushed bone powders with several fierce beast\u2019s true blood, and put them together into the slow cooking beast milk. At that moment, the fragrance began to rise in spirals.Afterwards, the elder threw in stalk after stalk of medicinal herbs. Soon after, the liquid within the pot became muddled, and the fragrance became even richer.\u201cTime to eat, little guy.\u201dWithin the stone house, the little guy heard the yell and with a\u00a0gulu\u00a0sound,\u00a0he turned around and then stood up. His eyes that had just woke up were still blurry, but as the fragrance leaked in, he quickly took a quick whiff. He immediately felt excited, and began muttering in that direction. \u201cSmells really good.\u201d\u201cOf course, this is genuine precious medicine, so don\u2019t waste any of it and eat\u00a0all of it.\u201d Shi Yunfeng laughed and said.The little guy\u00a0consumed it like a wolf, and before long, the pot\u2019s congee was completely gone. However, the negative consequences immediately appeared since he really was too small, and the medicinal strength was too strong. In this ordinary morning, the adorable little guy\u00a0suddenly began to act like a problem child. His two eyes turned red like a white rabbit, and he began to run all over the place, shouting\u00a0ah yah\u00a0nonstop.The pitiable large yellow dog\u2019s tail was once again grabbed by him, and was continuously being pulled. The tail was almost pulled off, and it howled\u00a0with tears for half a day; it disturbed all the villagers and caused chaos.\u201cWei, little guy,\u00a0why are you pulling up my brother\u2019s wife\u2019s fence?\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the little guy, why did he run up to my family\u2019s roof. Quickly, stop, don\u2019t tear off the tiles!\u201d\u2026\u2026The villagers were all stunned. The ordinarily extremely obedient little guy\u00a0transformed into a little vicious beast. He ran all over the place as he wreaked havoc while using all of his strength.\u201cThe pot of medicine was completely absorbed, and the results are not bad.\u201d Shi Yunfeng and several other elders were standing together, and they were currently quietly commenting, nodding their heads in satisfaction.In the distance, many children saw the scene in front of them and became even more frightful of the chief. All of them were quivering and trembling\u00a0as they\u00a0stayed far away. Gathering together, they muttered in a low voice, \u201cThe little guy is really pitiful!\u201dThe little guy\u2019s palms shone and he lifted them up towards the sky. From those small arms appeared the bone text, and it flickered\u00a0continuously; it was truly quite mysterious. In addition, his physique got stronger, and his speed and power were both promoted by a large margin as well. This was also the reason why the old chief was so satisfied.Only after two hours did he finally quiet down. He scratched his head in a daze, and said in a low voice, \u201cYiya, I\u2019m in trouble.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The little guy\u00a0was now already three and a half years old and had his own name \u2014 Shi HaoWhen he was only one and a half, he could only run along behind the others, and now that he was three and a half years old, his physique became astonishing. He was always running around together with the other big kids.At this moment, a piece of previously empty area of land in stone village was currently filled with people. It was so packed that even water could not trickle through, and everyone within the village was watching the youth practice martial arts.The group of children had extremely sturdy muscles, and their upper halves of their bodies were\u00a0naked. With sweat flying in all directions, they were all working hard. Some of them could unexpectedly lift up maces that weighed more than 100 jin. They waved\u00a0it around, making\u00a0huhu\u00a0sounds in the wind.The ages ranged from six or seven to twelve or thirteen, and all of them looked like small fierce beasts from within the mountain forest. They were extraordinarily strong, and their bodies were astonishingly strong and rugged.\u201cQuickly come and look, that is my family\u2019s baby. He\u2019s only six years old, but he can lift up a limestone weighing over 100 jin and use it as a shield. How many people can compare to him? In the future, he will definitely become an amazing hero in the Great Desolate Area!\u201d\u201cMy family\u2019s baby is the powerful one. You guys can all see that the bow made from the rhinoceros tendons that can only be pulled \u00a0by adults is being used by him. In the future, he\u2019ll definitely be able to kill fierce beasts with one shot, and even defeat an adult Pi Xiu.\u201dAlthough the villagers were all rather down-to-earth, when they were grouped up together, they all still loved to brag about their own child\u2019s strength. After comparing with each other, the group of strong individuals would clenched their fan-sized palms and continuously wave their fists around, smiling in delight.All of the females within the village could not hide their smiles, as this group of children\u00a0really were quite outstanding. All of them\u00a0had a dragon\u2019s vitality and a tiger\u2019s ferocity. Having unlimited strength, the future of stone village will surely to be great due to\u00a0this generation.\u201cMoo\u2026\u201dA fat cow howled, and the sound shook the village.\u201cQuickly come and look, Er Meng is only eight years old, and he actually flipped over a fat cow, impressive!\u201dWithin the large area was a black fat cow, and his whole body appeared as if it was covered by black silk fabric. It was releasing a muffled thunder-like roar, and just before it was about to go crazy, it was stubbornly knocked down by a not very tall child, triggering a gasps of admiration.\u201cOur efforts were not wasted. Several elders gave\u00a0them the true blood from fierce beasts every few days and let the precious medicine repair their bones and refine their bodies. It seems that the results were\u00a0quite effective.\u201d\u201cThe children are all quite strong. In the future, there might actually be quite a few people who can venture out and kill those great desolate species within the mountain range abyss.\u201dWith a loud\u00a0dong\u00a0sound ringing out, an extremely skinny child in the distance tossed a grindstone plate that flew out roughly ten meters.\u201cAiyou,\u00a0hey, the eight or nine year old Pi Hou who looks so dry and thin actually has\u00a0that much strength. People really shouldn\u2019t judge others by their appearances.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. Without looking at whose child he belonged to, I named him Shi Zhonghou. In the future, he will leave the great mountains, and he will have a great reputation. He\u00a0will be bestowed the title of king in front of a large prosperous race.The grown men were all bragging towards each other, and they all thought that their own children were the most outstanding.Honglong!The ground began to shake severely, and a shroud of smoke and dust began to rise. Everyone\u2019s eyes were attracted towards that direction, and to their astonishment, someone was trying to lift up the enormous cauldron!In the center of that empty space was an ancient cauldron that was over a thousand Jin in weight. On the cauldron were engraved with the designs of the beasts of the land and birds of the air; it was\u00a0overflowing with an ancient feeling. The walls of the cauldron were extremely thick, possessing an extremely heavy atmosphere. The legs of the cauldron were always being lifted, and so they were quite glossy. They were polished almost as if they were mirrors, and on them were branded the images of the Vermilion Bird.\u201cLittle Shijiao, you almost sprained your back just now only to lift it a bit off the ground. Right now you are still too young, even in four years you would not be able to lift this.\u201d Some of the older adults made fun of him good-naturedly.The thousand Jin copper cauldron was not something that you could casually mess with or else you could hurt yourself. Normally, no child was able to raise it and they were not allowed near it, as it was simply too heavy.\u201cLet me try!\u201dAn extremely robust lad walked forward appearing to be around twelve or thirteen. One hand was on the cauldron\u2019s ear, while the other one was on its leg. He grabbed it with fierce strength, and the large cauldron began to shake a bit before leaving\u00a0the ground. However, it immediately fell back towards the ground with a hong\u00a0sound, creating a cloud of dust.It was an obvious failure, but fortunately the child wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201cMe too!\u201dA child walked up to the front, and he was the one that previously knocked over that fat cow. His name was Shi Meng, and within his family he was number two. His nickname was Er Meng, and he actually had quite a rather thick and sturdy figure. In addition, he was only eight and a half.With a\u00a0weng\u00a0sound, the copper cauldron left the floor, and was gradually lifted up into the air, causing everyone to be shocked and startled. This was still a child, yet he could actually lift it to such a stage; it was extremely shocking.Hong!Unfortunately, he was not able to lift it above his head, and his two arms were already shaking. He\u00a0released it with a\u00a0honglong\u00a0sound, and a large pit remained\u00a0where the cauldron stood\u00a0as\u00a0granules of earth flew everywhere.Since someone decided to try it first, all of the other kids were eager to give it a try as well. In this way, each kid walked up and tried to move the cauldron, however, not a single person succeeded.A\u00a0big child with thick eyebrows and big eyes called Shi Dazhuang walked forward, and after taking in a huge breath, he used his strength to grab one of the cauldron\u2019s handles and one of its legs to fiercely\u00a0lift it up, and only then did it get successfully get lifted above his head.Although his arms were slightly shaking and both his legs were slightly swaying, he finally succeeded, causing all the adults to exclaim in astonishment. This was because this child was merely nine years old, and could be claimed as being naturally born with divine force!\u201cDazhuang performed really well, in the future he will definitely be incredible!\u201d\u201cThis is only a nine-year old baby. Being able to lift roughly 1000 jin\u2019s worth of weight, there aren\u2019t many people of his age who are comparable to him. In the future, he will inevitably be one of this region\u2019s most powerful individuals!\u201dThe adults were naturally not stingy with their praises, and even gave Er Meng endless encouragement and praise. This was because he almost succeeded as well, and his strength was astonishing.Several elders were smiling as well. The amount of effort they put in over these last few years were not wasted, since these fierce beasts\u2019 true blood were often used to forge and discipline these children\u2019s bodies. Now that these results were visible, in the future, Stone Village will have many ferocious individuals.\u201cLittle guy, you are sticking your head out and looking around, can it be that you want to try it out as well?\u201d\u00a0teased some of the adults.Within the crowd, there was a little guy curiously looking around, and that was precisely the little guy. Now, he finally received a name, and he was named Shi Hao. His figure was still extremely small, and he had to tiptoe while pushing into the crowd to see the big kids lift the cauldron.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone says that little\u00a0Hao has so much limitless divine force that it is astonishing. Although his age is a bit young, he should come and try it as well. Don\u2019t lift up the cauldron first, come and grab this stone lock.\u201dSomeone lifted his head and said, \u201cListening to my child words, little\u00a0Hao Hao\u2019s strength is not any less than theirs. I never believed them, and now that there\u2019s an opportunity, the little guy\u00a0should come and try it out.\u201dShi Hao was now three and a half, and his jet-black hair fell down to his shoulders. His big eyes were black and brilliant and were extremely lively. He was white and clean, pretty and cute.The little guy\u00a0looked toward the several Elders who all had smiling expressions on their faces. Shi Yunfeng said, \u201cGo, I also want to see how much strength you currently possess as well.,\u201d\u201cYa, hey!\u201d Shi Hao was still extremely small, and the sounds he made while using his strength were naturally soft and immature, however he effortlessly lifted the\u00a0big stone roller.\u201cNot simple!\u201d The others all nodded their heads.Afterwards, he also lifted up a stone grindstone plate and suddenly threw it. With a\u00a0sou\u00a0sound, that heavy stone tool looked like it was a common piece of rock\u00a0that was casually tossed aside, and flew a total distance of over sixty or seventy meters.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound, the grindstone plate smashed into the ground and produced a huge ditch, causing sand to fly in every direction. The dust rose everywhere, and the ground violently trembled.Everyone stared blankly, and were unable to say anything.Following that, the little guy\u00a0suddenly ran towards that black fat cow, and quickly used his strength to grab one of its horns, directly caused it to fall towards the ground.Although his strength was used with skill, it still meant that his strength was extraordinary. Accompanied with the sound of cold breaths, the villagers felt that they were looking at a small fierce beast showing off its power, shocking their vision.You have to understand that the current little Shi Hao was still really young and was the shortest inside the village. No matter how you looked at it, he still looked like a small baby, and it was hard to associate his body with his immense strength.Under the shocked expressions, Shi Hao walked towards the large cauldron and tried to stand up as tall as he could. It was impossible for him to grab the cauldron\u2019s handles, and so he directly crouched down his little body to prop up the base of the cauldron. Soon after, he abruptly used his strength, and with a\u00a0honglong\u00a0sound, the bronze large copper was lifted up above his head.Everyone there was stupefied and could not believe what they were seeing\u00a0in front of them. A three and half year old child could actually lift up the thousand jin copper cauldron, this was simply too ridiculous.What in the world is this? This is like a child of the Legendary Golden-Winged Peng , almost like a pure-blooded Pi Xiu Emperor\u2019s son. Little\u00a0Shi Hao might be comparable to a real young ancient fierce beast!Peng \u2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_(mythology)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although they had already heard about this previously and knew that the little guy\u2019s physique far exceeded his peers, no one could have imagined that it was so abnormal.\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have even used the Bone Text\u2019s mysterious powers yet right?\u201d Someone asked.\u201cNo he didn\u2019t. I saw very clearly that he purely utilized his body\u2019s strength.\u201d The hunting group\u2019s leader Shi Linghu replied.Hong!The little guy\u00a0Shi Hao threw the copper cauldron to the ground, and as it smashed into the ground, smoke and dust polluted the air. He quickly took a step back, avoiding\u00a0the rising dust. This loud noise once again made the villagers\u2019 hearts tighten; this truly was a little devil.The\u00a0results were\u00a0really hard to believe: a three year-old infant lifted up a thousand jin cauldron. Not to mention within the mountain range\u2019s vicinity, it would be difficult to find someone like him even within the limits of this earth.The villagers were all mind-blown, and even chief Shi Yunfeng was startled. He did not believe that Shi Hao could lift up such a large cauldron at his current age, and never expected\u00a0it at all.\u201cIs this real? How could that little brat Shi Hao have such a ridiculous amount of strength? I have never heard of a child like this one.\u201d\u201cIt really is quite inconceivable. If he did not have the body of a human, I would have thought that some ancient beast\u2019s child came here!\u201dAll of the villagers turned around, and they were commenting on\u00a0the\u00a0little guy\u2019s striking performance.\u201cChief, you\u2019ve been to a few prosperous regions right? Have you met any children like this one?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Yunfeng you\u2019ve been to many powerful tribes. Have you heard about anyone like this little devil?\u201d Even some of the elders couldn\u2019t hold themselves back any\u00a0longer\u00a0and had to ask.Shi Yunfeng replied, \u201cI was once at a clan that had several million members and met several of their extraordinary children. They all had unlimited amounts of great resources that would cause anyone to be stupefied. Although they were quite formidable for their ages, compared to the little guy, they were\u00a0still somewhat lacking.\u201dThe villagers who heard that all blanked, and then all began to laugh. This was heaven showing favor towards Stone Village! A young child that had power similar to an archaic beast\u2019s descendant, what would happen once he properly grew up?! Stone village would become prosperous because of him.An elder said while analyzing, \u201cThose large rich and powerful clans have as many experts as trees in a forest. They must have killed fierce beasts that were beyond frightening and used the true blood of rarely seen archaic beasts to refine and baptize the bodies of their especially talented children. Otherwise, the difference when compared to the little guy\u00a0would be even greater.\u201d\u201cThere are various limitless fields, vast and boundless. Those great clans and aristocratic territories from legends might have even more formidable children. After all, the world is too big, and the things we understand are merely a small corner of what is truly out there.\u201d Said Shi YunfengThe display of martial arts this time made all of the villagers extremely happy. The children were all quite strong, and the potential for growth was great. As for Shi Hao, that was a happiness beyond their expectations, since his performance was truly too shocking.While everyone began to scatter, several clan elders as well as Shi Linghu and some other important individuals did not leave. They continued to seriously discuss like before, as if the discussion they had previously never ended.\u201cWhen Shi Hao grows up in the future, in a one on one situation, won\u2019t he be able to defeat a\u00a0ferocious, pure blooded juvenile Suan Ni with his bare hands? As long as even one of those legendary archaic beasts comes out, then even an extremely powerful and large clan would be easily destroyed.\u201dTL:\u00a0The Suan Ni is a mythical lion. It was mentioned in Coiling Dragon.One of the elders extinguished his burning thoughts and said, \u201cHaving potential while you are young does not necessarily mean that you will become a powerful individual that will shock the world. You have to know that there are countless geniuses who faded away while they were young.\u201dEveryone was speechless, and soon after nodded their heads.Shi Yunfeng frowned and said, \u201cNow that you mention it, Shi Hao was born in this village, so he was not born with the physique of those other children with Xiantian parents. He had a worst start than them, and we cannot provide for him like those major clans with archaic true blood, mountain treasures, panaceas, etc.\u201dShi Linghu said, \u201cRight now he is still young. If it was before, then maybe he really would have been too late to catch up to the children from those great clans.\u201dShi Yunfeng thought for a bit before saying, \u201cAccording to my understanding, once a talented child reached five years old within one of those great clans inside the great earth\u2019s limits, they would enter their life\u2019s first crucial baptism. They would be placed inside of a\u00a0copper furnace a good deal of panaceas as well as archaic true blood\u00a0and a few other ingredients\u00a0to slowly refine the body, allowing it to increase in strength.\u201dThe others all softly sighed; after all, this was only a small village. Was it really possible for them to compete with those great clans? It wasn\u2019t even possible for them to procure those panaceas and the archaic true blood from legends.\u201cWe\u2019ll just try our best to kill some giant beasts\u00a0and\u00a0extract some of their precious blood. We\u2019ll accumulate it bit by bit and prepare for the little guy\u2019s five year-old baptism.\u201d\u00a0sighed an elder.Shi Linghu frowned and brought up another issue. \u201cIn order to be able to compete with those powerful kids from legends, besides shedding your body and building a strong foundation, practicing an inherited cultivation technique is also an important issue.\u201dChief Shi Yunfeng nodded his head and replied, \u201cI will look for a solution to this issue.\u201dEveryone at that time became stumped for words. They all knew in the past,\u00a0the chief left to explore the distant regions, he\u00a0had entered quite a few sects. In the end, through the price of blood and lives, he brought back some bone texts. Could it be that those were comparable to the ones passed down by those major clans?Ten or so brothers went through life or death struggles together, and only two of them returned while immersed in blood. In the end, only the chief survived, yet he still contracted some strange disease. His past was something that he never talked about, and none of the villagers asked him about it either.What exactly happened that year? There was obviously a secret that he didn\u2019t want to reveal.In the following days, chief Shi Yunfeng was always extremely busy, and would often be slowly refining medicinal herbs. Within the courtyard, the stove cauldron never ran out of fire, and the smell of medicine was extremely strong.\u201cGrandpa chief. You don\u2019t need to work so hard and be so tired. You need to rest too.\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyelashes were rather long, and were prettier than those of little girls\u2019 as he thoughtfully advised the old man to take a break.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Shi Yunfeng laughed while shaking his head.Several clan elders as well as Shi Linghu and the other people who were familiar with the situation didn\u2019t tell Shi Hao too much. He didn\u2019t know that Shi Yunfeng was actually preparing for his five-year old \u2018baptism\u2019.With the setting sun came the returning hunting troop. Each of them had a wild beast on their shoulders. Although there were some that were wounded, they were still all talking and laughing.The chief\u2019s stone courtyard was located near the village entrance, and Shi Hao was currently standing in front of the courtyard entrance while looking at everyone who was returning.\u201cUncles, you\u2019ve all returned.\u201d He lifted his small innocent and tender face. His eyes were clear and were a brilliant black as he politely greeted the returning group of individuals.\u2018Come here, these are your favorite berries. Uncle picked them especially for you.\u201d Shi Linghu handed over a package wrapped in animal skin. After opening it up, the inside was a bright red. A sweet scent traveled around, and each round fruit were like sparkling and translucent carnelians.\u2018Thank you uncle.\u201d Shi Hao blinked his big eyes, and happily received the berries.At night fall, the villagers once again offered the beast corpses to the willow tree as sacrifices. After finishing the ceremony, some of the more spiritual prey was\u00a0delivered to the chief\u2019s courtyard.Soon after, the smell of blood began to spread from the stone courtyard. Several fierce beasts were lined up over there, their bodies trickling with blood. Moreover, the beasts\u2019 bodies were gradually drying up, and were flickering with symbols, making them appear strange and mysterious.That was the Bone Text, and at this moment, it was interwoven within the blood as\u00a0tiny streaks of electricity streaked across. It looked as if Shi Yunfeng was performing sorcery, and he was currently using a mysterious force to slowly refine the best features of the beasts\u2019 blood to obtain\u00a0the \u2018blood medicine\u2019. After undergoing continuous smelting and refining, the amount of beast blood decreased more and more. At the end, there was only a single drop of blood left, and it was collected into a jade container. The blood bead was sparkling and translucent, and was brilliant like a blood diamond.\u201cAccording to what is recorded in the Bone Text, during the five year-old baptism, the panacea, true blood and other mysterious components will have a mystical effect on one\u2019s foundation, greatly affecting one\u2019s future.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng softly spoke.He did not want to waste Shi Hao\u2019s talent, and did not want him to fall behind the other major clan\u2019s geniuses. He\u00a0was always thinking of ways to save up the\u00a0materials needed for his \u2018baptism\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s better to go without than to go with a bad option; only high quality true blood is useful for the little guy. Unfortunately, it really is simply too rare. In addition, if it was excessively powerful, it might be too difficult to handle.\u201d He quietly said to himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Poisonous insects roamed about, and the roaring beasts were oppressive like thunder. There were vicious tigers, poisonous snakes, as well as other creatures that left behind distinct smells that attacked one\u2019s nostrils, making\u00a0people\u2019s skin and bones tremble.Roar\u2026From within the mountain range,\u00a0a thunder-like roar could be heard, causing the mountain stones to tumble. The rumbles echoed, the forest violently swayed, and leaves madly flew about. In the distance, large and ferocious beasts roamed about.A group of kids\u2019 faces were turning pale. There was already some distance between them and Stone Village as they were\u00a0hiding from the adults. They entered the old forest, but luckily they didn\u2019t enter the vicious beasts\u2019 true dwelling areas.\u201cBrother Dazhuang, the mountain forest is too dangerous. We are still too young. We shouldn\u2019t go forward anymore.\u201d A small child said with a trembling voice.They grew up near this mountain forest and naturally knew the dangers associated with it. There were many types of vicious beasts, and even their parents had to be extremely careful when venturing inside this mountain forest, as even they could easily lose their lives.The children in this group were still young, and there were\u00a0a total of around ten kids. The leader of that group was precisely that Shi Dazhuang who lifted up that 1,000 jin copper cauldron. He had\u00a0thick eyebrows,\u00a0big eyes as well as thick and bulky arms, moreover,\u00a0his height almost overtook those of some adults. He looked towards another person and asked, \u201cPi Hou, how much farther is it?\u201dTL: Pi Hou literally means skin monkeyPi Hou\u2019s birth name was Shi Zhonghou and he was born dry and skinny. However, he had great strength as well as being clever and quick-witted. He replied, \u201cI heard from Uncle Linghu that Cliff Village is not very far and is in this direction, so we should be there soon.\u201d\u201cShi Hao, what\u2019s your opinion?\u201d Shi Dazhuang asked.In the past, Shi Hao was only the group of kids\u2019 bum beetle and simple tagged along wherever they went. Ever since he lifted up that copper cauldron and made all the adults look at him like he was a little freak, there was no need to describe the reactions of the kids. He immediately became one of their group\u2019s \u2018backbone members\u2019.\u201cIt will be very dangerous if we keep walking.\u201d Little Shi Hao\u2019s voice was sharp and clear, and his clear black and white eyes were darting back and forth as he realistically spoke.\u201cBut the distance from here really isn\u2019t that far.\u201d Shi Dazhuang said.More than half the children moved and wanted to keep going.\u201cIf you guys want to go, then I am going too.\u201d Little Shi Hao said in a young and immature voice.Just like this, the group of children once again continued their journey and traveled roughly one li. The big trees began to thin out, and the vegetation became more and more scarce. Vicious beasts appeared more and more frequently, and waves of ominous energy permeated the air.Within the rugged stone mountains was the large Stone Forest. It was quiet and noiseless, and scattered on the floor were a few large beast\u2019s dead remains, snow white and astonishing.Pi Hou looked around and said in a soft voice, \u201cIt\u2019s right here, I heard Uncle Linghu talk about it before. Their hideout is located on a cliff in the abyss of Stone Forest.\u201dShi Dazhuang also lowered his voice and reminded all of the children, \u201cThese beast bones are most likely the remains of a beast\u2019s meal. Although at this moment it should not be inside of its nest, we still need to be careful. You absolutely cannot be discovered, otherwise, it\u2019s highly likely that you will lose your lives!\u201dThe ten or so children all grew up within the great desolate area. Their vigilance was\u00a0extremely high, similar to those of small mountain beasts. They quickly and nimbly hid within the cracks of Stone Forest to cover their bodies. They briefly surveyed their surroundings and utilized the wind to scout out odors. Afterwards, they mutually nodded their heads, and with the vigor of apes and monkeys, they charged into the Stone Forests\u2019 deepest parts.Along the way, they encountered many skeletal remains. There were ordinary bones that were snow white and enormous, covering roughly five to six meters in length, as well as large millstone-sized beast skulls. They all came from the various vicious beasts and birds that were feasted upon, causing the place to develop a dead atmosphere.\u201cIt needs to rest here for a bit after all. If it reproduces and produces descendants, when our Stone Village\u2019s residents enter the mountain range, they will definitely be faced with this deadly threat!\u201d\u201cUncle Linghu and the others have already discussed this for a few days and observed its characteristics and habits.\u201dThese children were mumbling while speeding along. Their speed was extremely fast, and they were like ten little tornadoes as they charged into the Stone Forest abyss.In front of them was\u00a0a stone cliff. The area was barren and it became increasingly more silent. There was a huge nest built at the top of the cliff out of\u00a0strips of black wood, and it emanated a\u00a0gloomy feeling.The children, all distantly separated, were hidden\u00a0between the cracks of the mountain rocks. The black nest was gigantic, and its diameter stretched 10 meters long. Anyone could see that the nest belonged to a vicious bird.\u201cSo it was here!\u201d\u201cThis Green Scaled Eagle wandered for a long time before finally building this gigantic nest. So what Linghu uncle said was true, and its going to have babies?\u201dThe eyes of the group of children sparkled. This was their main goal!These were all types of really aggressive and powerful birds, and their bodies possessed magical blood. They were extremely difficult to deal with, and\u00a0if the bird decided to prey on any beast or vicious being, they would be dead \u2026 it would be difficult for them to escape alive.\u201cUnder Uncle Linghu and the others\u2019 observations, that male Green Scaled Eagle had not shown itself lately and there was a chance that some unexpected accident happened within the mountain range that caused it to perish. Every day during noontime, a female bird would appear to hunt prey. If we want to get any closer, now is the best opportunity.\u201d Pi Hou said.The group of kids clenched their fists tightly and it was obvious that they were quite nervous. At the same time, however, there was a look of anticipation and excitement. These kids who all grew up within the mountain forest were all bold and daring, otherwise, they would not have acted on their own and traveled to a dangerous place like this.\u201cEveryone, hide inside these stone cracks. I\u2019ll throw a stone to test things out!\u201d A dark skinned child spoke. His name was Shi Meng, and the villagers all called him Er Meng. During Stone Village\u2019s martial arts practice, he directly knocked down a fat cow and almost lifted up that thousand jin copper cauldron. Within this group of kids, he was second only to Shi Hao and Shi Dazhuang.With a\u00a0hu\u00a0sound, a large piece of rock took flight and charged into the distance before a\u00a0dong\u00a0sound finally rang out. It dropped in front of the stone cliff, and it fell onto a pile of rubble, making\u00a0a large noise.All of them were startled, but luckily, there weren\u2019t any signs of activity on the mountain cliff.\u201cEr Meng, don\u2019t be so reckless. Be a bit more careful.\u201d\u201cI wanted to test to see if it was currently inside of its nest. Now that we know that there\u2019s no problem, let\u2019s hurry and check it out!\u201d Er Meng said while hinting his intent to rush forwards.\u201cBrother Er Meng, let\u2019s first wait a bit.\u201d Little Shi Hao spoke as he grabbed a decently sized rock and threw it with force. With a sou\u00a0sound, it flew towards the stone cliff and landed near the nest with a loud echoing noise.After a short period of time, the mountain cliff became very peaceful again, and the Green Scaled Eagle\u00a0did not actually appear.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe group of children were like a group of beasts, and with loud shouts, they charged at lightning speed towards the rocky cliff.\u201cBrother Dazhuang and the others wait here. Let me go up there and take a look first,\u201d\u00a0said Shi Hao.\u201cYou\u2019re a little baby that hasn\u2019t even stopped drinking milk yet. It\u2019s enough if you just stand on the side and watch. We\u2019ll go.\u201d Shi Dazhuang spoke, and the group of children laughed. Even now, the little guy still drank milk, and was constantly being teased.\u201cI started eating meat a long time ago. I only drink it sometimes as water!\u201d The little guy\u00a0was acting upset and wrinkling his nose. He stared with his big eyes that were like large black gems while trying to defend himself.Of course, the little guy was very smart and knew that the bigger kids were not really mocking him but were rather looking after him. They were not willing to let\u00a0him be the first one to take the risk of going up.\u201cI am faster than you guys so if there is danger, I will also be able to quickly escape.\u201d The little guy\u00a0did not wait for their response, and like a little monkey, he rushed over with a\u00a0sou\u00a0sound and began climbing the stone cliff cleverly and nimbly.\u201cDon\u2019t let it\u00a0notice us. We are going as well!\u201d Shi Dazhuang, Er Meng and Pi Hou all followed closely behind and similarly chased like monkeys.The cliff had many cracks, and the children borrowed them to quickly climb up. They grew up within the great mountains alongside the jungles. Naturally, their climbing abilities were formidable and were not inferior to the mountain range\u2019s fiendish apes by much.\u201cHu\u2026 I finally climbed all the way to the top!\u201dThe stone cliff was three hundred meters high. After the little guy\u00a0arrived, the other three individuals arrived shortly after. Only when all of them stuck out their heads did they walk towards that huge nest.\u201cWhat an enormous nest!\u201d Pi Hou gasped in admiration.Standing a bit closer while watching, they all felt that it was shocking. The nest was ten meters wide and was made out of a black wood. It occupied the majority of the cliff\u2019s apex and it was even bigger than one of Stone Village\u2019s houses.Outside of the bird\u2019s residence, there were also some large, sticky blood covered bones on top of the cliff. Each one was taller than an adult, and was absolutely horrifying.In particular, on top of that millstone sized beast bone, there were still some terrifying claw marks. There were\u00a0still some bloodstains left on them, making them appear extremely sinister.\u201cThese are the skeletal remains of the Dragon Fanged Elephant! It really is scary. A single winged beast could actually feast on such a huge elephant!\u201d Er Meng cried out in alarm.\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about these things for now.\u201d Shi Dazhuang said, and began to climb the black bird nest.Arriving on top of the nest, they immediately felt waves of dense odor as well as a bloody odor. The edges of the nest were\u00a0a dark red color, and it was evident that the Green Scaled Eagle ate its meals at the edge of its nest. After being contaminated with all types of beast blood for such a long time, this place developed an extremely deep baleful aura.\u201cThat ferocious bird is not here!\u201d\u201cCome look, there are several bird eggs!\u201dSeveral children cried out in alarm and were extremely reckless. From what they eavesdropped in the village, the flying beasts all came from eggs.\u201cPerfect, let\u2019s quickly carry them out and raise them within the village. In the future, we will have giant ferocious birds to help us hunt! Bring back the prey!\u201d Pi Hou excitedly yelled.The inside of the nest was layered with soft golden silk grass. It looked really comfortable, and the sparkling and translucent jade-like eggs peacefully emerged from inside that area. On the outside of the egg were net like patterns as well as scattered dots, and its luster flickered in the light.These ferocious bird eggs were all as big as water basins. Beneath the flickering glare, they\u00a0were dark green like cornelian, and under the sunlight, the stripes were bright and dazzling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He quickly walked forward and said, \u201cThis is the biggest nest I\u2019ve ever stolen from and the biggest egg I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\u201cHehe, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s only when I steal from this kind of nest that I feel a sense of accomplishment.\u201d Pi Hou insipidly laughed like a mountain monkey.\u201cTruly beautiful!\u201d The little guy\u00a0Shi Hao\u2019s eyelashes fluttered as his large eyes blinked. He watched the three warm bird eggs that were full of luster glisten like crystals. He could not help but rejoice. Being the youngest, he was extremely curious and wanted to hold the eggs to examine them closely.Shi Meng approached closer, but right when he reached out his hand to touch the giant egg, he let out an\u00a0aiyou sound. He felt like his arm had gone numb, as if it had been shocked by electricity.\u201cWhat is going on?!\u201d The several children were alarmed.On the jade-like egg shell, spots and markings shone beautifully like a star glowing in the sky, and a mysterious power was flowing around it.\u201cTruly powerful. The Green Scaled Eagle is the descendant of an Archaic beast, and although its bloodline has not been pure since long ago, inside its life imprint were still several Bone Texts that had been passed down.\u201d The little guy\u00a0said this with a crisp voice. He studied the Bone Text every day and managed to draw an inkling of insight from this.The children were all startled and happy. The creature who gave birth to these eggs was rare and powerful, and so the hatchlings would definitely inherit its rare and precious bloodline.\u00a0In the future, they could protect the village and be comparable to a village\u2019s guardian spirit.\u201cThe brilliant radiance only flows about the spots on the eggshells. Be careful not to touch those areas, and put them into the animal hide pouches. We need to hurry and leave.\u201d Shi Dazhuang was tall and strong, as well as very sturdy and solid. He urged the others to hurry up, as now was not the time to be idling about.Naturally, they had already made preparations earlier. Each person carried an animal skin pouch, and they quickly opened it and very carefully placed the vicious bird eggs into them. Altogether there was three water basin sized jasper eggs, and other than the little guy, each of the other three individuals carried one pouch.\u201cThis is great, we actually succeeded.\u201d Er Meng was very happy, and he laughed until a snot bubble almost formed.Pi Hou was also giggling, and he said. \u201cIn the future, our Stone Village will have powerful vicious birds as guardians. The chief, uncle Linghu and the others will all be convinced that we have done great and look at us in\u00a0a different\u00a0light.\u201d\u201cAiyou!\u201d Shi Dazhuang staggered and almost fell, but was propped up by the little guy.The vicious bird\u2019s nest was covered in golden silk grass, making it really soft. However, in the center, there were a few hidden scales that gave off flashes of chilly metal luster. Shi Da Zhuang wasn\u2019t paying\u00a0attention\u00a0to the ground and stepped on one. It pierced through his shoe, causing some blood to drip out from his sole. Fortunately,\u00a0only the skin was scratched.\u201cSuch sharp scales!\u201d The little guy\u00a0Shi Hao took the green scales and collected them with his hands. They were each\u00a0the size of an infant and flickered with cold light.\u201cThis has to be the mature vicious bird\u2019s scales, no wonder it is out of the ordinary. I reckon that even a broadsword nearing 100 jin in weight would not be able to split open these scales!\u201d Pi Hou said.The few kids did not dare dawdle around, and they rapidly descended along the cliff like lizards. They reached the ground extremely quickly, wiped off their sweat, and let out a deep breath.\u201cHow was it? Did you guys gain anything?\u201d The group of children all gathered around.\u201cWe succeeded. We smuggled out a bunch of bird eggs.\u00a0Haha\u2026\u201d Er Meng laughed loudly.The children opened the animal hide pouches and looked at the contents inside. They all gasped in admiration when they saw the eggs that were as large as water basins. The eggs were shining like gems with mysterious clear specks.\u201cAwesome! We succeeded!\u201d\u201cThese are actually the powerful vicious bird\u2019s eggs. Our Stone Village will have flying battle birds in the future.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s leave!\u201dThey were happy and excited, and they pranced around like a group of little mountain beasts. Moving swiftly, they soon left Stone Forest and the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s home.\u201cThis time, things really went smoothly. Let\u2019s leave this place quickly!\u201dThe mountain forest was dense with plant growth, and the dead leaves piled up into thick layers, providing soft ground to step on. Large trees reached\u00a0high into the sky\u00a0as they\u00a0covered the scorching sun. Old vines were like dragons as they snaked\u00a0around the trees. In the distant area, various\u00a0beasts roared from time to time, shaking the mountain area.The distance from their current location to Stone Village was not that far. They were in a relatively safe area, and they did not actually go near the dangerous areas within the great mountains where ferocious beasts roamed about.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, one more\u00a0burst of energy! Let\u2019s run back to the village in one breath!\u201dAlthough the group of children were extremely excited, they still felt a bit of worry within their hearts. After all, it was a Green Scaled Eagle that even made all of the strongest and fittest adults from the village feel fear. They successfully made away with the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s eggs from within its nest, and it didn\u2019t feel real.Suddenly, a bird cry rang out within the vast sky as if it could pierce gold and split stones. The sound was extremely sharp and intense, and had a type of penetrating nature, causing the group of children\u2019s eardrums to hurt.\u201cOh no! That Green Scaled Eagle must have return and\u00a0gone mad after discovering\u00a0her\u00a0three eggs missing.\u201d One of the children cried out.\u201cEscape quickly!\u201d Little Shi Hao\u2019 eyes were very bright, and could see through the cracks between the huge trees. He saw that in the sky there was a shadow circling about and heading this way.High up in the sky, the gales were howling. A huge bird casted a huge shadow over the mountain forest and dove down with an extremely fast speed. Its entire body was flowing with a cyan-colored cold light, and the vicious qi was astonishing.By now, all the other kids had\u00a0seen that in the distance, an enormous bird was flying in the sky towards the mountain forest. Its speed was extremely fast, and it was like a star falling from the sky. The speed was frightening.\u201cHoly shit! What a huge bird! Run for it!\u201dThe children were all crying out in alarm, and felt fear grow within their hearts. Its body was seven or eight meters wide, and when it expanded its wings, it would cover fifteen meters. Its entire body was covered in green-colored scales, and they were flickering with a chilly metal luster as its fiendish aura oppressed\u00a0everything!The group of kids were scampering off in all directions, madly trying to escape by relying on their familiarity of the mountain forest. They specifically ran towards the secret areas to hide from the vicious beast that was covered in scales\u00a0and radiating\u00a0cold light.Hong!Several towering great trees were smashed to pieces by its steel wings, causing the branches and leaves to fly all over the place, and fragments to fly everywhere. It appeared as if it was forged out of metal, and while diving down, it crushed all obstacles in its path.This made people horrified, and the children were all screaming loudly. Their faces were all pale and they were running away as fast as they could.This huge monster was extremely scary, and with its steel wings smashing about, it destroyed everything. It scales were flickering with the forest\u2019s cold radiance, and with a single dive, it destroyed a large part of the mountain forest, causing wood fragments and ruined leaves to flutter\u00a0about.It was too powerful. Its body was incomparably solid, and its two wings were like wide blades. It was completely capable of breaking apart a mountain peak; those forest trees did not stand a chance.It was similar to a huge eagle, however its body did not have a single feather. Thick scales covering its body, making it look like\u00a0it was forged out of molten metal,\u00a0full of shocking power.The curved eagle beak gave off a black light and was pointed like a spear. It was almost a meter long, and there was still the blood of vicious beasts on top of it; it was obvious that it had just returned from its hunt. In addition, its claws were even more intimidating. They gave off a cold radiance in the forest, and they were extremely sharp. They were almost a meter in length, and they could easily tear apart an enormous elephant.On its head were some plume-like protrusions, but they were definitely not feathers. Instead, they were sharp bony outgrowths. Like a row of thorns, they could easily\u00a0tear open\u00a0a large vicious beast\u2019s chest.This was precisely the Green Scaled Eagle, and its body was covered densely in ice cold cyan scales. Its body was full of boundless power\u00a0as if\u00a0it was forged out of\u00a0steel. It was sweeping across the mountain forest, causing the large forest to become empty.Hong!Within the rumbling sounds, the towering large trees were being broken tree after tree, and many of the trees were so thick that a dozen men could wrap their arms around it. The Green Scaled Eagle directly swooped down, and its steel wings broke apart all obstacles in its way, making branches and leaves fly everywhere.There was a loud peng\u00a0sound, and\u00a0a giant mountain rock that was in its path was completely obliterated. Sparks flew everywhere and stones scattered randomly. Many 100 jin heavy rocks smashed in all four directions, breaking many huge trees; it was an\u00a0extremely shocking sight.All the kids felt cold from their hair all the way down to their bones. This Green Scaled Eagle was simply too strong. If not for that piece of mountain rock blocking its attacks, many of them would most likely have been killed.After the Green Scaled Eagle destroyed a large area of the mountain forest, it flew back into the sky and hovered in midair. Its sharp eagle eyes coldly stared downwards, preparing to dive down once again to kill the children that were currently escaping.\u201cThe village is not far from here. Let\u2019s rush there quickly!\u201d The children shouted loudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its speed is too fast. There\u2019s no way we can escape back to the village.\u201d\u00a0shouted Pi Hou. He was grimacing in pain, as he had just been pelted in the arm by a rock as a result of the chaos. A huge chunk of flesh was broken, and blood\u00a0flowed\u00a0directly from that wound.\u201cThere is a rather deep cave over here. Let\u2019s hide in there for a while!\u201d The little guy\u00a0Shi Hao yelled towards everyone.They were fleeing within the mountains, and after bypassing some large rocks, they charged into a group of giant vines. The little guy\u00a0stealthily slipped in, and when the other kids saw this, they all followed closely behind.This was a very damp cave, and it was covered with vines. A vague water dripping noise could be heard, and the lighting was extremely dim, making it almost pitch-black. The cavern was incomparably serene and hidden, and after entering, none of the children wanted to stand still. They all madly rushed in, and only after running ten meters did they stop.Within the darkness, there were heavy breathing sounds. After running continuously for 500 meters, the ten or so children were all exhausted. Just now they were frightened and scared; that Green Scaled Eagle was too powerful. If that vicious bird caught up, one claw swipe would turn them into a pile of bloody mud and crushed bones.\u201cHu, so dangerous. Just a bit more and we would have been finished!\u201d After escaping the calamity and getting a renewed life, they all sat their buttocks on the ground.\u201cThis cave entrance isn\u2019t too large, so that vicious bird should not be able to enter.\u201d Although the children began to relax a bit, they did not forget to take precautions.The experience they faced this time was truly dangerous, and their corpses were almost buried within the mountain forest. After escaping that Archaic Devil Bird descendant\u2019s claws, they finally began to feel a bit more tranquil, and their backs were covered with a layer of cold sweat.The cave was extremely deep and was linked up to an underground river. Cold wind swished by, and the children were looking at each other in dismay. Some of them were anxious; how were they going to return to Stone Village? None of them dared to exit this cave.\u201cYi, that\u2019s right. Little guy, how did you know that there was a cave here?\u201d After they calmed down a bit, the group of children remembered that at the crucial moment, the little guy\u00a0found this path of life.\u201cYiya!\u201d The little guy\u00a0was a bit embarrassed, and shyly played with the corners of his clothes. In a small murmuring noise, he said. \u201cLast time, I ran out of the village while chasing after a scarlet sparrow, and almost got lost. I accidentally stumbled here.\u201dThe group of kids became mute.\u00a0The little guy\u00a0was great at everything, but he was too restless, and was extremely curious about everything. When he was little, there was a time when he also ran out of the village chasing the chief\u2019s big yellow dog.\u201cHehe\u2026 the three year old little HaoHao still drinks\u00a0milk and chases after everything!\u201d The older kids were all teasing him.The little guy\u00a0felt embarrassed and was puffing his cheeks. Pouting with rage, he innocently said, \u201cStop laughing you guys. That was a sparrow completely covered in a blood red color. It looked exactly like the Archaic Divine Vermilion Bird recorded in the Bone Texts.\u201d\u201cChe, forget about those legendary existences, even a Red Cloud Bird or a later generation would all be able to eliminate a super clan. If it really was a Vermilion Bird, would it allow you to chase after it? Just a yawn from it would obliterate an emperor\u2019s territory!\u201d\u201cBut it really was exactly the same as what was recorded on the Bone Text. It was a deep red, and extremely beautiful.\u201d The little guy\u00a0was trying to defend himself, and his small white hands were gripped tightly. His little flushed red face was a bit emotional, and his black jewel-like big eyes were radiating in the darkness.Dong!Suddenly, an oppressive sound rang out and roused all the children. They turned their heads to look, and saw a ice cold and metallic radiance flickering at the cave entrance . The Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s head appeared, and its pupils were astonishingly cold and deep\u00a0as it stared\u00a0at the children within the cave.\u201cHeavens, he\u2019s coming!\u201d Many of the children\u2019s faces suddenly lost color, becoming incomparably pale.\u201cThere\u2019s no problem, the entrance is not large, there\u2019s no way he can enter!\u201d Er Meng was quite brave, and while speaking, he picked up a face sized rock and threw it with all of his strength.Peng!With such a huge rock thrown with his thousand jin strength, the speed was fast, and the power was formidable as well. It immediately smashed into the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s head. However, the only thing that happened was a few sparks flew\u00a0and a sound began to echo. That metal like green-colored scale flickered with cold light, and was not damaged in the slightest. Instead, the rock split into four pieces before falling to the ground.Everyone took in a cold breath. This vicious bird had copper skin and metal bones, and it was too powerful; it made people tremble inside.Pu.With one claw, it instantly easily grabbed several hundred jin\u2019s weight of rock, as if it was a sharp iron hook clawing at mud.The group of children were dumbstruck. Could it be\u00a0that not even the cave\u2019s entrance could stop it?Kacha!The sound of rocks shattering once again rang out. The Green Scaled Eagle flapped its wings and streaked across the sky like a\u00a0knife, splitting the rock walls into pieces. Huge rocks rumbled and tumbled, and that huge body stubbornly forced its way in.\u201cToo scary, it could blast open a low mountain like this? It won\u2019t actually collapse this cavern and flatten this area right?\u201dPi Hou took out his bow and readied an arrow. That was a Dragon Horn Hard Bow, and it was cut from the Dragon Fanged Elephant. Normally, only the adults could pull back the strings, as it was made from Stone Village\u2019s best bow materials.Xiu!An arrow flew out with extreme speed, and great power. The arrow flew like a meteor, swift and fierce.Dang!However, what caused people to be shocked was that the arrow shot towards the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s head only created a string of sparks; its scales were truly difficult to penetrate. Even this type of hard bow and sharp arrow were not effective.Everyone felt scared and upset, what were they going to do now? Even such a strong bow could not harm it. Other than this, there was simply no way they would go up and fight it in close combat. They were stuck in a desperate situation.\u201cYiya, let me try.\u201dThe little guy\u00a0borrowed an iron spear from the body of a big child that was only forty or fifty jin in weight. He bursted into a small run, and then he suddenly gained speed\u00a0as he\u00a0rushed towards the entrance. At he end, he ferociously tossed the iron spear, and it appeared as if a strip of lightning pierced the air\u00a0as\u00a0cold light charged\u00a0towards the entrance.Shi Hao, who\u00a0could lift up the thousand jin copper cauldron, used all of his strength to throw the iron spear. Its penetrating power was frightening\u00a0as it\u00a0shot towards the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s pupil. The iron spear covered the sky, made a whistling sound, and pressured air followed it with booming sounds!The Green Scaled Eagle continued to loathingly clawed at the children, and right now was the first moment where it actually expressed\u00a0a hint of amazement. It quickly moved its head, and did not dare let its eyes get pierced by that\u00a0iron spear.After a large\u00a0qiang\u00a0sound, the iron spear shot out with astonishing speed and power as it\u00a0smashed into the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s head. As if two slabs of metal plates were grinded together, sparks flew everywhere, and the emitted sound\u00a0was extremely ear-piercing.Finally, the iron spear fell onto the floor, but a scale on the corners of the vicious bird\u2019s eyes also fell. A stream of blood trickled out, and it was extremely eye-catching.A reverberating sound rang out from the Green Scaled Eagle, and it felt as if lightning was hacking away at one\u2019s\u00a0soul. It was grand and massive at first, before transforming\u00a0into a sharp and penetrating sound. It was like a dragon\u2019s roar, extremely terrifying.Several kids were so startled they took a few steps back\u00a0before falling with\u00a0their buttocks onto the ground. They used their hands to cover their ears at once, otherwise, they eardrums\u00a0would have been damaged.The vicious bird carelessly allowed itself to get wounded, and thus as a result went mad. The eagle\u2019s eyes were cold like sharp blades, and he stared at little Shi Hao. Brandishing its huge claws, it madly clawed at the cave\u2019s walls and vigorously forced itself in.Rocks rolled everywhere, from 10 jin to more than 100 jin, and were crushed as if they were rotting wood. The cavern was being torn open, and the Green Scaled Eagle angrily cried out as it attacked.\u201cShoot, this giant bird is going crazy. We won\u2019t be clawed into pieces by it right?\u201d Pi Hou and the others were all scared, and some of the children were beginning to regret it. No wonder the adults never acted blindly without thinking; this vicious bird was too frightening.\u201cThis place is quite close to Stone Village, grandpa chief and the others will definitely hear the activity and send people to rescue us.\u201d Little Shi Hao spoke.\u201cThat\u2019s right, let\u2019s use all of our strength to attack and infuriate it, causing it to make even more sounds. Chief and the others will definitely discover it sooner!\u201d Shi Dazhuang said as he picked up a large rock and ferociously smashing it towards the vicious bird.The bird\u2019s cry became even more terrifying, and shook the cave until dust began to fall everywhere. Rocks rolled everywhere, and that large and densely covered body approached step by step, furiously tearing open the stone walls.The group of children used their bows and arrows to shoot at its eyes and delivered their iron spears to Shi Hao, Er Meng, and Shi Dazhuang. They allowed the three most powerful individuals to shoot the spears at the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s eyes.The mountain forest rocks collapsed everywhere, and leaves madly danced about. The vicious bird closed its eyes and retreated several steps from the cave,\u00a0completely flattened the surrounding mountain area.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u00a0What caused that Green Scaled Eagle to go so mad as to come to our village and cause such a ruckus?.\u201dThe people inside of Stone Village began to notice the abnormality, and began to become suspicious. They quickly sent people to report to several elders, and\u00a0a\u00a0group of people arrived at the village head\u2019s high platform area to watch from the sidelines.Chief, today I saw Er Meng, Da Zhuang and the little guy\u00a0skulking around furtively. This trouble should not be their fault right?\u201cThese brats!\u201d Shi Lin Hu smacked his thigh, suddenly remembering that while they were discussing about the Green Scaled Eagle, Pi Hou and a few other kids were sneakily eavesdropping.Chief Shi Yunfeng immediately understood the severity of the situation after obtaining this information. In an extremely decisive manner, he said, \u201cQuickly go, go fetch the two Ancestral Artifacts. We will go together!\u201dThe strongest men within Stone Village all took action, and for the sake of the children, their eyes all became red. Who cares if you are some Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s descendant, we will still fight! Some of them carried hundred jin Wolf Fang Poles, and some carried super bows that were as tall as people. Some of them even carried black iron broadswords that were almost as tall as them; they looked ferocious and murderous.\u201cRelax, nothing will happen to the kids . If that featherless eagle dares to do anything, I\u2019ll definitely slice it into pieces and feed it to the pigs in the village!\u201d These men consoled their wives, loudly shouting before rushing out the villager in a clamor.The group of robust men were like a group of ferocious beasts,\u00a0and theyhad powerful imposing manners. From afar, they had already begun firing arrows, and the thick arrow shafts were like javelins. They were also all iron arrows, and their might was astonishing.Dong, dong\u2026After the giant arrows were fired out, many trees were pierced through and broken; they were\u00a0extremely mad and tyrannical. It was like as if a group of tall and savage people screamed by, as they loudly berated the vicious bird.The Green Scaled Eagle had long withdrawn from the cave entrance, and its ice cold pupils were staring at these virtuous fighters. It did not know the meaning of fear because it was a top-notch predator within this area. As long as it did not enter the depths of the mountain range, it could do as it pleased.Extending its wings, the furious wind howled. Many of the heavy arrows and metal spears that were shot towards the eagle were blown away. Amidst the clashing noises, sparks madly flew everywhere as the eagle raised its head and cried out loudly. The fury in its eyes grew, and after flapping its wings, it shot towards the group of people.Its had a seven to eight meter long body\u00a0that\u00a0reached fifteen meters after extending both its wings. Such a giant figure charging over had an extremely terrifying demeanor. Broken and battered twigs and leaves exploded into pieces, and before the eagle even approached near, the horrifying air currents already made the people\u2019s faces hurt.\u201cEveryone should defend together. Lin Hu, you go get the sacrificial artifacts!\u201d Chief\u00a0Shi Yunfeng said.With such a terrifying Devil Bird descendant powerfully shaking about, it would\u00a0definitely cause disastrous damage. Only by using the Ancient Treasure Artifact\u2019s intimidation passed down from the village ancestors would we have a chance of making it run back in fear.\u201cFeatherless eagle,\u00a0come here, charge towards me!\u201d Shi LinHu shouted. Being at the furthermost point, he raised his head and watched as the fierce bird swooped down. Meanwhile he took out a piece of animal bone that resembled\u00a0the arm bone of a vicious beast.The pupils of the green scaled eagle glistened as if it had some sort of reaction and halted its attack. Unwaveringly, the eagle glared at the lusterless bone. It began to take precautions, and its half meter black beak suddenly released a brilliant light. A symbol appeared, and it began to emit a frightening oppressive power.\u201cGood fellow, this green scaled eagle is surely one of a kind. It\u2019s body possess blood that carries the symbolic mark, representing its formidable strength.\u201d Old chief exclaimed admirably.Roar!Meanwhile, Shi Linhu roared while understanding the emergency situation. He persevered, and used\u00a0all his strength to move forward. His left arm glowed, and a bone text appeared and\u00a0dazzled brilliantly. Suddenly, he took that piece of arm bone and press it towards his own arm.Bang!He exhaled powerfully into the air, and it was as if there was a frantic hurricane. It seemed as if the king of beasts has resurrected, and it even frightened the vicious bird in the sky. It rapidly rushed towards the sky to increase the\u00a0amount of distance between them.Shi Linhu\u2019s left arm radiated, and that piece of the vicious animal arm bone fused with his own arm. It became a part of his body, and mixed with his flesh mysteriously as if there\u00a0was\u00a0no distinction.Not only did that left arm\u2019s radiance became increasingly more magnificent, it also condensed an ancient symbol, as if there\u00a0was\u00a0a vicious beast that wanted to escape from the symbol itself!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He became quite a big stronger, and his entire body was surrounded by slips of lightning like light beams. His blood qi was astonishing.Although the Green Scaled Eagle was terrified of the air released by that beast bone, deep within, it was unwilling to resign. The black bird beak that was similar to a curved blade assembled a bright luster, the symbol became more and more powerful, and it was getting ready to attack.This type of mysterious power was accumulating at the bird\u2019s beak, and it became increasingly brighter, causing all the other birds and animals at the mountain to shake with fear.\u201cFeijiao, you come as well!\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng ordered another strong male villager to use the second Ancestral Artifact.Shi Feijiao was exceptionally strong, and he threw the big wolf-toothed club from his hand using his mysterious power. His chest suddenly lit up with the light from the bone text, and the light flickered as though they were shining stars. He quickly retrieved an old and bloodstained beast hide from his bosom and fiercely pressed it onto his chest.Hong!A fierce aura spread out, terrifying all the nearby living animals as if an archaic beast descended nearby, and even the Green Scaled Eagle in the air became terrified. It once again halted its dive and displayed a hint of nervousness from within its eyes.Shi Feijiao\u2019s chest flickered with light, and that old piece of ancient beast hide fused into his chest, becoming a part of his skin. Emitted a formidable life force, and started to release a bright radiance before a mysterious symbol finally appeared.A faintly discernible beast head appeared from that symbol as if trying to free itself from that symbol.Another face seemed to have appeared on Shi Feijiao\u2019s chest. With the Ancient beast hide embedded in his flesh, the text slowly started to take shape and a figure of a vicious beast appeared.An majestic force pressured and engulfed the entire mountain forest, stunning many people!This was precisely the Stone Village\u2019s other ancestral artifact, a piece of ancient beast hide. It wasn\u2019t clear which era this beast hide was from, but it was still evidently shed from the body of an Archaic beast and was also able to form a rare and powerful text.The bone text that mankind possessed was mostly copied from the precious bones of vicious beasts, but it didn\u2019t mean that all vicious beasts had their mysterious powers embedded into their bones. Some had it embedded on their skin, and there were even some in their heart.The light on Shi Fei Jiao\u2019s body grew more and more radiant, making him look like he was ablaze and resplendent all over. From his chest, a beast howled like thunder, causing the entire mountain forest to shake and create landslides.This wasn\u2019t an ordinary bone text that mankind simply copied and later developed, but rather an original source of precious beast hide. It was extremely powerful.An ordinary village couldn\u2019t possible have this, let alone having two ancestral artifacts. It was quite evident that there was a period of time when Stone Village was quite great.Shi Linghu and Shi Feijiao stood shoulder to shoulder and looked towards the sky at the vicious bird before releasing all the strength of the ancestral artifact. A violent stream of air blasted towards the sky.The bushes and brambles nearby were all blown away in front of their eyes.The cold eyes of the Green Scaled Eagle was bewildered. It did not dare approach any closer and appeared to be frozen in fear. Both parties faced each other, and there was a short period of serenity.\u201cAo, the village head arrived, uncle Linghu came to save us!\u201d A few children poked their head out from within the deep cave and began to cheer.\u201cLet\u2019s go, village head and uncle came to take us home.\u201dWithin the stone cave, children came running out like a swarm of bees and ran towards the adults. Even now, Shi Ling Hu and Shi Fei Jiao relied on the ancestral artifacts to provide support as the children and adults quickly came together.\u201cChildren, nothing bad happened, right?\u201d A bunch of adults came rushing, and came and held their own children, and rotated them around for inspection fearing any injuries that might have occurred.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, we\u2019re all good, and there are only a few scratches on some of us.\u201d The children responded.\u201cIt\u2019s good that nothing happened.\u201d The eager adults finally calmed down, and immediately with their palms, spanked all their kids\u2019 bottoms.\u201cOWW!! It HURTS!! Why are you hurting us? Didn\u2019t you just care about us? Why did your face change so fast?\u201d The children screamed.A strong man said: \u201cThis is this and that is that. Since you\u2019re not hurt, then there must be punishment. You guys didn\u2019t even grow any hair yet and you dare to provoke a demon bird. If I don\u2019t spank your butts rotten, then I can\u2019t be considered your father!\u201dThe hostile Green Scaled Eagle was in mid-air as it revealed a hint of ominous aura. However, it never dove down, and rather vigilantly staying there without taking any immediate action.Village chief Shi Yunfeng shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and leave. Linghu and Feijiao\u2019s understanding of the bone text isn\u2019t too profound and can\u2019t use the ancestral artifacts to their full effect. Let\u2019s take advantage of the current situation and return.\u201d He himself secretly had a disease and was not suitable for big battles.All the children were found and nothing unexpected happened to anyone; this is the best news. A group of adults held large clubs and armed their huge gigantic bows while carefully returning to the village with their children in the middle.\u201cWOW! Uncle Linghu you\u2019re so awesome, all these years Grandpa Chief always experimented on you guys, and unexpectedly obtained such wonderful results. You\u2019re geniuses. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true! And also, Uncle Feijiao, what kind of weapons are you using? Why haven\u2019t we seen this before? Is it because you have to understand the bone text to be able to use it?\u00a0Uncle, you guys are so majestic and powerful.\u201dOn the path of retreat, the kids ignored the vicious bird in mid-air. Taking advantage and flattering the adults in fear of being further reprimanded upon returning.\u201cLess smooth-talking, turn around and you\u2019ll be cut!\u201d Pihou\u2019s father eyes widened.The Green Scaled Eagle followed on the entire way back until it saw the old willow tree near the village and it didn\u2019t dare continue further. It circled them in mid-air and cried out angrily.Everyone finally let out a sigh of relief. After being followed by the tyrannical descendant of a Archaic devil bird, their hearts were always tight because if they messed up even a little bit, many people would have died.\u201cThis time we used the ancestral artifacts, hopefully, this doesn\u2019t result in some complications.\u201d The village chief said.\u201cIt\u2019s okay chief, who would pass through this wild and mountainous region? No one could have saw that.\u201d Shi Linghu said.\u201cHopefully it\u2019s as you say, the stuff we inherited from our ancestors had been\u00a0gathering dust for a long time. It would be great if no unforeseeable incidents arrived because of this.\u201d Shi Yunfeng said lightly.The anticipated bloodbath did not occur, and they safely returned to the village. The devil bird\u2019s descendant was still in mid-air, crying out sharply enough to split rocks.After entering the village, everyone started jumping around, and the women rushed forward and immediately embraced their own children. After receiving the news not long along, they couldn\u2019t stop feeling apprehensive and the men immediately started finding planks, preparing to beat up these naughty rascals.\u201cYou little brat, who told you to go cause trouble, stand there now!\u201d\u201cDad stop hitting me! I know I\u2019m wrong!\u201dA group of children hurriedly scampered, and finally all escaped to the chief\u2019s yard, and begged for his help to not let their parents punish them.After arriving at the chief\u2019s yard, the group of children were all angry with envy. The little guy\u00a0didn\u2019t receive any punishment at all. Instead, they discovered he was holding up a small bowl of milk and drinking out of it with a small wooden spoon.\u201cWa, little guy,\u00a0you\u2019re drinking milk again. You\u2019re three and half now.\u201d A bigger kid said.Yiya! The little guy\u00a0was majorly embarrassed\u00a0as he\u00a0held his little bowl, and hid it away from the eyes of the bigger kids with his delicate white hands. His was flushed red and his eyelashes were trembling and said: \u201cYou\u2019re just seeing things. I\u2019m\u2026 actually\u2026 drinking water.\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201d The group of children exploded in laughter.\u201cWe\u2019re all being beaten up, how come you on the other hand have milk to drink?\u201d Pi Hou inquisitively asked.\u201cIt\u2019s because I told Grandpa Chief a story and he thought it was good so he didn\u2019t blame me at all. \u201d The little guy\u2019s big eyes slowly shifted.\u201cWhat story?\u2018\u201cThe story of Little Red.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s Little Red?\u201d\u201cLittle Red is the the baby scarlet sparrow, I told you guys.\u201d The little guy\u00a0was clearly unhappy.The group of kids rolled their eyes, hissing, \u201cIf the chief actually believed that then he\u2019s naive, the Vermilion Bird was a myth even in the ancient times, how there there possibly be one right now, and even chased by you!\u201d\u201cWu, two years ago, there was an unknown Mountain Treasure that appeared in the depth of the mountain region. It drew in many tyrannical ancient species, causing an unimaginable battle. A scarlet flame swept across the sky, and we could see the faintly discernible traces of a ten day fire even from our village.\u201d The chief came and said.\u201dClearly, a fire beast hides in the depth of the mountain region, but it shouldn\u2019t be a mythical vermilion bird since it\u2019s not very realistic.\u201d At this moment, Shi Linghu arrived as well.\u201cTwo years ago, that battle was extremely frightening, yet we truly didn\u2019t know what kind of gigantic and ancient beasts had arrived. One day late at night, I saw a towering man-like figure carrying a black stick, and with one step, it crossed a mountain ridge, but I didn\u2019t clearly see its face.\u201d Shi Feijiao sighed. \u2018Til this day he\u2019s still horrified by the scene.The adults arrived. The group of children\u2019s faces suddenly turned bitter, as the adults were here to pick them up after chasing them all the way to the chief\u2019s place.\u201cChief, we found a nest full of the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s eggs and took them so that we can raise archaic devil birds, perhaps in the future they can collaborate and protect our village. \u201d\u201cRight, in the future, our Stone Village could have flying war birds. These are three eggs from the descendant of an Archaic Devil Bird!\u201dThe kids were all trying to show off as much as possible for the sake of receiving forgiveness.\u201cDo you know how much meat a single vicious bird consumes a day? Even for us, food is always a bit lacking, where do we find extra food to raise three huge monsters.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d The children frowned.\u201cAlso, you think we\u2019re done with this fiasco? Look outside the village. \u201d A village elder sighed.The children stepped on a tall platform and peering outside the village in astonishment. That terrifying Green Scaled Eagle was perched on top of a huge rock. Its eyes were cold, and its green scales shined brilliantly as it guarded the outskirts of the village without any intent of leaving.\u201cThis type of vicious bird is quite\u00a0vengeful; you stole its eggs, how could it let such a thing go? In the future even hunting for our village will be difficult.\u201d Shi Feijiao anxiously said.The children\u2019s faces turned white, knowing they caused a disaster.\u201cYiya, let\u2019s just return its eggs, the Green Scaled Eagle is quite pitiable without its eggs.\u201d The little guy\u00a0winked and quietly said.\u201cThis eagle is really terrifying. If we don\u2019t return its eggs, perhaps it will bother us to no end. Our village will never be at peace. Even if we have ancestral artifacts, it will be difficult to deal with as no one here can truly activate these priceless treasures\u2019 true effects.\u201dThe villagers decided try and deliver the eggs outside. If even that didn\u2019t work out, then they would find another method.Three big water basins were brought out, and each of them held a jade coloured egg. They were sparkling all over with a beautiful translucent radiance, and the mysterious symbols\u2019 strength filled the air, appearing godlike.Right when everyone had just left the courtyard and hadn\u2019t even taken many steps, the altar near the chief\u2019s house \u2014 that old black willow tree, suddenly trembled. A single branch clad in a divine green aura dipped down, and like a divine chain, it gently brushed the surface of an egg, instantly creating rays of radiating light!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its eyes shot out lightning-like beams and vigilantly stared towards the altar.The egg brushed by the tender green willow branch shined in a thousand splendid colors and was surrounded by a dense aura of light. In an instant, it looked like a divine object, bright, sparkly, and extremely shocking.On the eggshell, the spots radiated light like small suns and emitted a strong burning sensation, as if an exuberant life force became more prominent. Furthermore, there were many mysterious patterns that appeared\u00a0near the spots, and they\u00a0looked like awe-inspiring divine serpents. The whole scene appeared as if a vermilion bird was bathing in fire.That egg changed indescribably, and the mysterious patterns inter-weaved. After a short while, the entire egg was covered in a gorgeous pattern. Godly splendor flowed in all four directions.\u201cThe life force in this egg just became many times more powerful, the ancient devil bird\u2019s mark is recovering a lot in this particular offspring. If this egg hatches, the offspring\u2019s strength will definitely far surpass the Green Scaled Eagle.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng said shockingly.This egg was a bit special, as it could potentially inherit many of the ancient devil bird\u2019s imprint fragments. An ancestral inheritance phenomenon was taking place, and its bloodline would definitely be of an extremely high quality, far surpassing its parents\u2019.The scene of the old willow tree branch lightly brushing the egg caused people to be mind-blown! Did the willow tree find the egg special or was it due to some other mysterious force that caused the egg to mutate?The entire village was shocked, and after looking at that splendid and shining egg, their eyes shone brightly. This was a rare war-bird, and its potential was limitless.Outside the village, the Green Scaled Eagle covered in glistening scales perched on top of the huge rock. Both of its eyes staring intently, and didn\u2019t dare to believe what was happening either.It really wanted to rush into village to get a better look, but after seeing the old willow tree, it instinctively kept away and stayed outside to cry.That lovely and jade-like willow branch no longer moved after displaying its lifelike movement of brushing the egg.Clearly, its wasn\u2019t that interested, it just merely brushed the egg.The villagers all reveled, and only calmed down after a long while.\u201cChief, do we keep this egg?\u201d asked Shi Linhu. Right now, the villagers were all moved and full of passion. This\u00a0was a magical and precious egg, and it would be a shame to let such an\u00a0opportunity go.\u201c\u201cDon\u2019t you see the vicious bird outside the village? If we keep the egg, it will go crazy.\u201d Shi Yunfeng frowned.The old willow tree was very mysterious and powerful, constantly protecting the village and obstructing ferocious beasts from destroying the village. Stone Village was its domain, but it was only defending. It would never even move outside the village, let alone voluntarily attack something.That Green Scaled Eagle didn\u2019t dare enter, but it only needed to block the village exit to make Stone Village\u2019s people feel tormented. After all, the villagers still needed to go hunt in the mountain range.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s return this egg to that big furry bird.\u201d An elder said.The villagers were all disappointed but there was no other way. The Green Scaled Eagle was too powerful. It was this region\u2019s apex predator. If creatures that lived in the depth of the mountain range didn\u2019t come out, it could definitely be considered the overlord.A villager, careful and prudent, used the two ancestral artifacts as protection\u00a0to\u00a0deliver the three eggs to the village entrance. He\u00a0laid it on the grass\u00a0before quickly returning.Right now, that mutated egg\u2019s burning aura and radiance already dissipated and was no longer dazzling; however, the newly formed mysterious patterns never faded away, differentiating itself from the other two eggs and making it seem as if two different species of birds laid the eggs.The Green Scaled Eagle flapped its wings, and let loose a violent gust of wind and threw itself over in an instant. Both wings spread, and suddenly protected all three eggs. Afterwards, it stared intently at that striped, lustrous, sparkling, special egg.After letting out a long hiss, this vicious bird seemed extremely excited. Its voice cracked the skies, trembled the fields and forests and left leaves fluttering wildly in the air.After a long while, it raised its head and left a strange look in its eyes, its fearful radiance had long vanished and stared at the old willow tree in the village but didn\u2019t dare take half a step inside the village.\u201cHurry up and leave with your eggs already.\u201d A few adults shouted, as if chasing away an epidemic.However, beyond all expectation, the Green Scaled Eagle spread its wings, and after flapping furiously, released a violent gust of wind that pushed the three eggs back into the village towards the willow tree.\u201cWhat, it doesn\u2019t want them, it\u2019s giving them to us?\u201d Everyone stood there in stupor. What was going on? Strange things were happening one after the other.\u201cIt saw a mutated egg covered in dense mysterious symbols, in the future the offspring will far surpass it. It wants to offer it to us as a sacrifice and wants us to raise it.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng said.\u201cIt had these sort of thoughts?\u201d A group of people were amazed.\u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u00a0this is a vicious bird that condensed mysterious symbols within its body, and it possesses an overflowing mysterious power within its bones. Its wisdom should not be lower than that of a human\u2019s.\u201d The old chief spoke.The more formidable and unique the vicious bird was, the more wisdom it would possess. Legend has it that there were some Archaic beings with intelligence that were vastly superior to a human\u2019s. They overlooked various tribes as if they were deities.The village chief loudly inquired whether or not it really wanted to leave its descendants here. That Green Scaled Eagle actually nodded its head in response, and with its gaze flickering, it looked towards those three eggs before once again glancing at that old willow tree.Hu!After creating a violent gale, the Green Scaled Eagle spread both its wings that spanned roughly fifteen or sixteen meters and rushed into the air. In the blink of an eye, It disappeared into the clouds.Everyone was stupefied; it left just like this? There were three sparkling and translucent eggs left on the ground, and no one had expected that things would end up this way.\u201cUncle Linhu, what should we do now?\u201d Er Meng asked.\u201cWhat to do? This situation was caused by you kids, so you little brats need to take responsibility!\u201d Shi Linhu scowled.\u201cAh, no! Save us!\u201d The group of kids began to miserably shriek.The three eggs were beside the great willow tree altar. Some people were assigned to protect them and to quietly wait until the birds hatched. After all, these were the eggs of a powerful vicious bird, and they were extremely precious.After roughly a dozen days, a clear\u00a0kacha\u00a0sound rang out, and a crack appeared on one of the eggs. The jade colored shell split open, and from inside tumbled out a little guy covered in green flashing scales.Following that, another egg also began to crack open, and what struggled out was a similarly another little guy. It stuck its head out and looked around, eyes bright while examining its surroundings.The third egg was extremely special, and when the egg began to crack open, rays of multicolored light shot in all directions. Afterwards, a chirp rang out, and the solid egg was suddenly completely smashed open into fine powder, and the hatchling possessed a divine splendor.A young hatchling appeared, and its body did not have any green scales, but rather purple scales. Light sparkled all around its body, as if a ball of fire was currently burning. It was quite a bit more mystical and mysterious than its two brothers.After a long while, the purple ball of light dissipated, this spiritually astonishing hatchling was shrouded in brilliant purple scales, vivacious large eyes as if they could speak, curiously looked at everyone. There was no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that this was an extraordinary bird.\u201cThey hatched!\u201d A group of children cheered, ran home, and took some meat to feed the three new hatchlings.Suddenly, a long bird cry sounded. A huge vicious bird dove down from above the clouds, rapidly approaching Stone Village and casting a large shadow.\u201cYi, it disappeared for half a month, and now the Green Scaled Eagle returned once again! Is it going to break its promise and take back its children?\u201d Some villagers cried out in surprise.\u201cWrong, what\u2019s that?\u201d People were shocked showed amazement in with their eyes.Hong!\u00a0Dust flew up into the air, the Green Scaled Hawk loosened its claws, and a colossal monster smashed into the ground creating a huge crater. Earth, smoke and dust all flew outwards.This was a huge Dragon Horned Elephant, 67 meters long and 56 meters tall. The pair of dragon horns gave off a splendid light, and the extremely heavy body easily snapped the ancient trees that reached into the skies. It had been dead for a while already, and its huge skull already had several claw marks embedded into them. Blood was rushing out; it must have been killed almost instantly.\u201cGreen Scaled Eagle what do you want us to do? Is it actually to feed the three hatchlings? You really are like a human, full of mighty wisdom!\u201d The villagers gasped in admiration.After a short cry, a violent wind erupted and roiled up the huge branches and leaves. The Green Scaled Eagle once again soared towards the heavens.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. No one could have thought that the Green Scaled Eagle would deliver them a fierce beast. These types of vicious birds were all intelligent and wise.In the following days, the Green Scaled Eagle unceasingly presented them with fierce beasts. From flying pythons to gigantic elephants, all kinds of fierce beasts from the mountain range were delivered.After only a month, the three little tykes fattened up like balloons. They were almost two meters long, and their food consumption was also extremely shocking, increasing day by day.\u201cThe eldest is called Da Peng, the second is called Xiao Qing, the youngest, Zi Yun.\u201d These were the three names given to them by the children.TL: The literal definitions of the names are Big Peng (Chinese Mythical Creature), Little Green and Violet Cloud.Needless to say, these three Green Scaled Eagle were all very intelligent, extraordinarily magical, and they all excelled at understanding human nature. No matter what was said to them, they would understand; the only difference was that they simply couldn\u2019t speak the language of humans.Especially the youngest, Zi Yun, as it was the most intelligent. At the same time, it was also particularly powerful. After just reaching one meter long, it decided to flap its wings and run out the village. It came back after shredding a few tiger wolves, leaving the villagers stupefied.\u201cLittle Zi, come quick.\u201d Shi Hao ran in front. Zi Yun eagerly chased from behind. This made all the other children very envious. This mystical sparrow was extra amiable towards\u00a0the little guy.\u201cChirp, Chirp!\u201d Zi Yun ran towards the front, using a scaly wing to help the little guy\u00a0massage his back. It\u2019s very hard to associate this with the behavior of a vicious Green Scaled Eagle.\u201cWhat a suck-up, isn\u2019t it just because the little guy\u00a0is teaching you Bone Text?!\u201d A group of kids angrily pouted.The little guy\u00a0took another approach, and insisted on teaching the three Green Scaled Eagles the Bone Text researched by humans. This mutated Zi Yun was actually very enthusiastic in learning; it was smarter than humans and gradually became increasingly close.Xiu!The little guy\u00a0raised his arms, and the symbols on them lit up. Both arms were covered densely in a net-like pattern, and they were brilliant and resplendent. After pointing in a direction, a small scarlet sparrow flew toward a large tree trunk and instantly burned it.Pa, Pa!Zi Yun used both wings to clap, letting out a\u00a0Pa\u00a0sound, as if it was applauding. A pair of large vivid eyes blinked, incessantly chirping and expressing his excitement.\u201cWa, this little bird is so refined. Only a month old, and it knows this much already. Much stronger than a month old human. \u201d A group of kids shouted.Kengchi kengchi. The other two Green Scaled Eagles Da Peng and Xiao Qing also ran close, head-butting the little guy. Wise vicious beasts thirsted for power much more than humans, especially after learning that these Bone Texts could help accelerate their growth.In these past few days, the little guy\u00a0Shi Hao also gained a lot. Because the Green Scaled Eagles were a descendent of the Archaic beasts, their bodies naturally contained tons of precious bones and shockingly powerful mysterious symbols. He was constantly observing them.These ancient and precious bones gave birth to powerful and mysterious patterns exclusive to one type of species. The stronger the archaic descendants were, the stronger their desire to hoard the power of their own mysterious symbols became as well. Otherwise, others would use all their strength to try and gain these powers. These three hatchlings were special, and they were raised by the villagers, so they were much rarer than primitive mysterious symbols. Their symbols far surpassed that of an ordinary human-researched bone text, and to not spread out the secret, they were only called treasured symbols.It\u2019s possible that these types of mysterious symbols were comparable to a strong man-made bone scripture, but all creatures with natural-born mysterious symbols were extraordinary.Stone Village\u2019s two ancestral artifacts were both made from the carcasses of two super high-leveled archaic descendants. Only after undergoing some polishing and smelting did they become the treasures they are now.During this period, Shi Hao always hung out with the three hatchlings and was able to break through a few barriers. Chief Shi Yunfeng was also very happy that they were always together.Especially Zi Yun, as he underwent the phenomenon of Ancestral Inheritance. Even if it only inherited a small part of the original Archaic devil bird\u2019s imprint, it was still extremely terrifying and had an astonishing amount of prospect. The mysterious symbols in its body would definitely be worthy enough to be called a \u201cMysterious Bone Scripture.\u201dIf this news got out, this would definitely arouse the other tribes\u2019 temptations.At dawn, a red sun rose from within the fog, and a soft and comforting light spread out. The mist in the mountains began to develop a red hue as it flowed ever so slowly.The air was very fresh, and dewdrops tumbled along the grass and vines. A group of robust males were planning to once again leave Stone Village to go hunting.\u201cUncle, you have to be careful in the mountains.\u201d The little guy\u00a0Shi Hao was leading the three hatchlings in making noise as he eagerly ran to send them off. He raised his little face that had two bright eyes, and sent his regards to them one by one. He went to bed early and rose up early as well.The group of male at the prime of their lives laughed heartily. They came towards him and pinched his little face that was blushing like a big apple before heading off towards the mountains with big steps.\u201cLittle Zi let me see again, what exactly is happening with the mysterious symbols forming within your body. I still don\u2019t really understand.\u201dAfter the event, the little guy\u00a0extended his white and tender hands and intimately embraced Zi Yun\u2019s neck. It made it rather relaxed, exposing the treasured bone\u2019s imprints so that he could easily look around.\u201cChirp, Chirp\u2026.\u201d Da Peng was a bit discontent, and so it scooted over while head-butted his palm.\u201cDa Peng stop that, I\u2019ll examine your mysterious symbols afterwards, Xiao Qing I\u2019ll help you catch a fish later as well. Don\u2019t disturb us right now.\u201d The little guy\u00a0embraced their necks in a similar fashion to appease them.In reality, the three hatchlings were a head taller than Shi Hao right now. Whether it was the past or present, he was always the little guy in the village.\u201cWOW, so this is how it works, it\u2019s so complicated similar to constellations.\u201d The little guy\u00a0looked at the mysterious symbols that appeared on the surface of Zi Yun\u2019s treasured bone. His eyes were wide open and he finally understood much more.\u201cChirp chirp!\u201dDa Peng and Xiao Qing were also quite curious and looked at the mysterious symbols on their brother\u2019s body. Their eyes never blinked, and it was almost like they wanted to memorize and work hard to digest all the information in their head.\u201cDa Peng, Xiao Qing, let me look at your treasured symbols.\u201d The little guy\u00a0turned around and put his attention on the other two Green Scaled Eagle.He unceasingly felt about while making contact with their treasured bones. Sparkling light emerged and mysterious symbols formed, and even their scales were adorned in a splendid fashion.The little guy\u00a0pondered deeply, perfecting what he acquired over many days and then shut his eyes and muttered: \u201cSo it\u2019s like this, complicated mysterious patterns interweaved like so. Evolving and shining, the mysterious strength would emerge forth\u2026..\u201dXiu!The little guy\u2019s left hand lit up a bit, and a glistening crescent moon rushed out and rapidly flew towards the distance. It snapped a towering tree right in half, and the tree fell to the floor, rumbling and filling the air with dust.\u201cWa!\u00a0The little guy, he succeeded. He succeeded in studying the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s innate skills. That\u2019s their treasured symbol right there, so strong!\u201d Not far away, a group of kids saw and were instantly alarmed.\u201cStop talking!\u201d The chief appeared. Naturally all this commotion made him appear, and had to shut all the kids up so that they did not disturb Shi Hao who had gained a sudden insight and was currently pondering.\u201cLittle Zi, let me see again. I pretty much understood the imprints from Da Peng and Xiao Qing.\u201d Shi Hao held Zi Yun\u2019s neck, eyes bright as if he suddenly understood so much more.Zi Yun let out a long chirp and his revealed his brilliant splendor on his body appearing divine. Although it was still young, it already gave off an atmosphere that was high and mighty, moving the hearts of the villagers.Mysterious and complicated, the ever-changing mysterious symbols on the surface made its purple scales appear sparkling and translucent. It was extremely magnificent!The little guy\u2019s eyes shined brightly, and as if they were shining jewels, he stared at the treasured symbols. After a long while, he raised an arm. A burning light was moving on his arm and rushed into his palm before shooting out.Qiang!That light shot out like an unsheathed sword and made a metallic sound. A divine and bright disked moon flew out. It was embedded in a huge 56 meter tall boulder as it spun in place.\u00a0Kacha!\u00a0That huge boulder was instantly cut in half.The cut was smooth, and after a rumble, the top half of the boulder weighing over a thousand jin fell to the floor. Rubble flew up and dust rose.In the distance, the group of people who were watching became petrified. How strong was this power? A bright disk-like moon was able to chop straight through a boulder that was as hard as metal, completely startling everyone.\u201cSuch an incredibly strong mysterious symbol! This purple hatchling indeed inherited the archaic devil bird\u2019s imprint fragments, once again proving that fact.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng emotionally said. \u201cThe little guy really is formidable. After only a month, he was unexpectedly able to feel out this ancient treasured symbols\u2019 secrets, how shockingly talented\u201dZi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing were all surprised. They were all young, and still couldn\u2019t activate their innate symbols\u2019 strength yet. They were all excited after seeing the result.\u201cGrandpa chief, I think I understand.\u201d The little guy\u2019s\u00a0eyes lit up and happily yelled out.Shi Yunfeng quickly came over, complimenting and said: \u201cThe primitive symbols you just used, it absolutely could be called \u2018Mysterious Bone Scripture\u2019. It is extremely rare and powerful beyond belief. Don\u2019t use it unless you absolutely have to.\u201dThe little guy\u00a0blinked his big eyes before scratching his head and asking, \u201cHow strong can it be? It\u2019s not even perfect yet, I feel like a tree and a palace should appear on that disk-like moon, but I can\u2019t do that yet.\u201d\u201cAt the very least, right now you should be as strong as your uncle Linghu and Feijiao, \u2018Mysterious Bone Scripture\u2019 was a treasure that all tribes absolutely desired.\u201d The chief solemnly said.The little guy\u00a0acknowledged it and consciously nodded, and then giggled innocently. Today, he trained relentlessly and was a step closer to perfection. Even the chief was in admiration, unable to be of any help.At sundown, the horizon was doused in red, and the group of hunters returned. There weren\u2019t that much prey and there were also people being carried home.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, what happened?\u201d The villagers rushed out nervously.\u201cRelax, no one lost their life, but Pi Hou\u2019s father suffered heavy injuries. He was shot near the liver by an arrow. \u201d Shi Linghu showed an ugly face.\u201cHow\u2019d this happen?\u201d A few elders appeared and inquired.\u201cIt was caused by the Wolf\u00a0Village\u00a0ten li out. We haven\u2019t seen a trace of them in half a year. We don\u2019t know the reason why, but they came into our hunting area and fought over our prey and almost shot Pi Hou\u2019s father dead.\u201d1 Li = 500 meters,\u00a01 Jin = 500 grams.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He held one of Shi Shoushan\u2019s arms while tears rolling down. \u201cWhat happened, who injured you?\u201dHis mother ran over with tears dripping and grabbed another one of Shi Shoushan\u2019s hands while crying on the side.\u201cWhy cry? So what if I got shot by an arrow, I often get hurt when hunting vicious beats. Bleeding a bit like this is nothing.\u201d Shi Shoushan stared right at them and did not cry. He was a strong-willed man.Half his body was bloodstained, and an iron arrow pierced through his iron armor. It penetrated his right lung right through the back, and a 1.3 meter long arrow shaft, shiny, cold and stained with blood stuck out. This was a ghastly sight.\u201cElder sister-in-law and nephew, don\u2019t cry anymore, brother Shoushan is still in a critical condition. After supporting him for a while, he will be as strong as an ox. He will get better really quickly.\u201d Fei Shijiao urged.This was not a light injury. Even though Shi Shoushan had a strong body, he could not be incredibly careless or else he might suffer a grave condition and lose his life.Fortunately, Shi Linghu and the others had already treated his injuries using crushed medicine from within the old mountain and applied it to his wound. At the same time he consumed the medicine made from a fierce beast\u2019s true blood that the elder provided.\u201cStop crying, being able to return alive is already a fortunate event.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng approached and suddenly pulled out the iron arrow. A stream of blood spouted out. He rapidly flashed his hands, and mysterious symbols that were as bright as constellations immediately pressed down, closing the wound and stopping the blood flow.Shi Yunfeng took out a jade jar from his chest and poured out two fragrant purple medicinal pills. He squeezed one of them into powder and applied it onto the wound while giving Shi Shoushan the other to swallow.Shi Shoushan was lifted back home. The village\u2019s men and women both young and old gathered to visit him, and they brought all kinds of different supplemental medicine and dried meat as gifts. It was bustling and the villagers were all sincere and warmhearted.\u201cUncle will certainly get better soon!\u201d The little guy also gave his kind regards and brought him a basket of his favorite red berries.\u201cAlright\u2026 what happened?\u201d In the chief\u2019s courtyard, a bunch of important people gathered. Shi Yunfeng furrowed his eyebrows and asked.\u201cChief, it was certainly Wolf\u00a0Village causing trouble. They overstepped their boundaries into our territory, and plundered a six footed camel that Shoushan killed. There was a clear killing intent, but thankfully, Shoushan promptly dodged. That was indeed a shot aimed at the heart.\u201d Shi Linghu angrily said.Everyone\u2019s complexion changed; this was an intent to kill.\u201cTo go this far, they really are ignorant of what is considered upright and honest. Although our two villages are only separated by 10 li, we both have our own territories to defend and almost never meet each other. However, we both live on the same mountain range, so no matter what, we should still give each other some face right? It definitely was not like this before.\u201d An elder exclaimed.Shi Feijiao said: \u201cA child shot the arrow, at least 14 or 15 years old, his outward appearance wasn\u2019t bad, as he was rather fair and attractive. However, he truly had a vicious heart, as he shot the arrow straight at Shoushan as if he was killing a wild beast. There wasn\u2019t a hint of wavering in his eyes; they were cold and fearsome.\u201dAt that moment, Stone Village\u2019s villagers were all infuriated, and all of them rushed forward together. However, their opponents were not weak either, and roughly ten individuals from the opposing party gathered right away while unyieldingly holding their ground.Fortunately, from within the mountain range appeared a mad Suan Ni whose roar made the mountains tremble. Both parties were anxious and rapidly retreated, otherwise, a blood battle might have occurred there.\u201cWhy are they being so aggressive? Don\u2019t tell me that they feel so superior that they can ignore our feelings. How could they take advantage of people like this!?\u201d A few elders were also furious. As they all lived within the mountains, strong and robust males were all extremely important to a village. The other clan unexpectedly acted in such a fashion and dared to kill whoever they wanted.A few people added: \u201cThat child was not very simple. He gave us the feeling that he was up to no good. Looking at him felt like facing an adult Pi Xiu, strong, savage and callous.\u201d\u201cIt seems like Wolf\u00a0Village\u00a0has developed an exceptional youth, and have strengthened by quite a bit. Right now, they are flourishing so their ambitions are also growing.\u201d The village elder said while squinting his eyes towards the Wolf\u00a0Village.Soon after, he turned his head towards Shi Linghu and the others and said, \u201cWe do not want to cause any trouble, but we are also not afraid of trouble. Be mindful of them in the days to come. If they act up again, do not hesitate in taking action.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Shi Linghu nodded.In the blink of an eye, half a month passed. Wolf\u00a0Village\u00a0overstepped their boundaries so often to the point that they even set up many traps for the fierce beasts. Many of Stone Village\u2019s people accidentally set off the traps and were almost stabbed by the iron spikes underneath.Precisely because of these events, blood was almost shed. Ultimately, however, Wolf\u00a0Village\u00a0retreated.\u201cHow can you be this crazy in hunting fierce beasts? Even if their population increased, acting in this way is quite abnormal. A major event must have happened within their village.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng inferred.After several conflicts, Wolf\u00a0Village\u2019s people mostly disappeared. However, the villagers of Stone Village were not relieved one bit. They decided to send some people over at night. The spies heard yelling from within the village; it was quite strange.\u201cDo not take action first. As long as they do not go overboard, there\u2019s no need for bloodshed. Living in this mountain range is not easy.\u201d An elder said.Just like this, peace was restored again.After a few days, Stone Village\u2019s luck was pretty good, hunts were rather successful. In the mountains, they came across several carcasses of fierce beasts after internal conflicts. There were many strong mysterious beasts that engaged in battles, and brought disaster within the mountain wherever they went, causing many wild beasts to suffer.In the depths of the mountain range, Archaic descendants conflicted from time to time. They were fighting with the intent to kill each other, causing irreparable calamities. This was the case, but fortunately, it did not spread to the village.\u201cChief, just Dragon Horned Elephants alone accounted for eight of the bodies, and there were also several Snow White Moon Rhinoceros, as well as other types of huge beasts. If we made them into dried meat, it could feed us for a long time to come.\u201dShi Linghu brought people to drag some pieces home, and gathered even more to once again transport those fierce beasts.\u201cGood, good, good!\u201d The elders were all elated.A large part of the villagers all left together to provide support in the mountains.\u201cAo, so many huge beasts, let\u2019s go too. We can certainly gather a lot of true blood!\u201d A group of children clamored and shouted.After seeing the little guy\u2019s skills improving more and more over these past few years, none of the children could bear it any longer and no longer resisted medicinal baths. They were all very cooperative and obediently baptized themselves within the copper cauldrons. Now that they found out a large amount of precious blood was available, they were naturally all rather excited.\u201cI\u2019ll go as well. Da Peng, Xiao Qing, Zi Yun, wait for me in the village and behave yourselves.\u201d The little guy Shi Hao also followed.However, when everyone were just halfway to their destination, they all saw Shi Feijai covered in blood returning with a group of villager. Their appearances were in a mess and they miserable.\u201cFeijai what happened?\u201d Shi Linghu asked loudly.\u201cBrother Linghu, it\u2019s Wolf\u00a0Village\u00a0again, they wanted to chase us away and take away all the leftover fierce beasts!\u201d Shi Feijai clenched his teeth in anger.\u201cWhat! Truly intolerable. We\u2019ve been putting up with them repeatedly and they take our good temperament as a sign of weakness?\u201d Shi Linghu was furious.Stone Village\u2019s people could no longer ignore this matter. Again and again, the opposing clan arrogantly took advantage of them; this was not the first time the other clan provoked them.\u201cDid any of our brothers lose their lives?\u201d\u201cNo, but there are a few with severe injuries. Their Spleens were penetrated by iron arrows, and we do not know if their injuries are fatal.\u201cWhat! To commit such fierce actions, if it\u2019s a fight they want, it\u2019s a fight they\u2019ll get!\u201dThe villagers immediately exploded. After repeated humiliations, even a reserved person would be somewhat angry.\u201cThat 14 or 15 year-old child was truly vicious. All of those arrows were shot by him, and had it not been for one of their village elders shaking his head at him, he truly would had killed many of us.\u201d Er Meng\u2019s father said while his entire body was bloodstained.\u201cHe\u2019s just a child whose hair hasn\u2019t even grown yet, how strong can he be? Don\u2019t tell me that you guys are unable to do anything about it?\u201d A crippled villager resentfully spoke in support.\u201cNaturally we are not scared, except they have much more people. Their numbers are many times more than we have.\u201d\u201cThat child is quite formidable. Despite having a rather attractive appearance, he truly has a ruthless heart. Do not be careless, a few brothers were covered in three layers of iron armor, yet they were still all penetrated by his arrows. In our village only Shi Linghu and I can do that.\u201d Shi Feijiao added.\u201cWe need to take back what is rightfully ours. We absolutely cannot take this lying down!\u201d Everyone felt as if a flame ignited within their hearts, as if their five viscera were doused with oil, burning with anger.A formidable group of people rushed into the depth of the mountain. This time, Wolf\u00a0Village\u00a0truly went too far and crossed the bottom line.\u201cUncle Fu, you\u2019re hurt too. Everything will be alright, it will get better quickly.\u201d The little guy looked at the bloodied body of Shi Linghu who helped him pick up his favorite berries every time. He clenched his tiny fists, and after comforting him a bit, he began to chase after the group that went ahead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Here, trees that touched the skies were snapped in half, thousand year old vines were destroyed, and all kinds of beast carcasses were scattered in a large mess.Two mysterious beasts were currently engaging in intense combat, invoking riots and causing many ordinary beasts to die. In addition, Wolf Village once again chased away Shi Feijiao and others. This area was currently in absolute chaos.Those beast carcasses were stacked up on a small hill, and were later all carried away by the Wolf Village, completely emptying the stack out. After Shi Linghu came back to the area, he could only grit his teeth in anger; this was truly intolerable. The villagers\u2019 hard work of gathering up all the prey was in vain. The pile of corpses were stolen, just like that.\u201cChase!\u201dThey hardly stopped, and continued to follow the tracks of Wolf Village and expected those people to be slower when carrying such heavy huge beasts. There were obvious tracks left by them on the mountain: fierce beasts\u2019 hair, blood, scales. These revealed the route that the Wolf Village took.\u201cCareful!\u201dShi Linghu who led the way waved his hand and signalled everyone to come to a halt. He pushed aside a large chunk of withered grass and leaves in front of him, revealing a large black hole. Inside of the hole were many steel spears that pointed towards the sky. If anyone fell in, they would immediately have all their innards skewered out.\u201cThis child of the Wolf Village is truly savage.\u201dEveryone from Stone Village grew increasingly furious. This was still within their territory, but the Wolf Village actually dared to do as they pleased. \u00a0If things continued like so, a bloody tragedy was inevitable.After quickly advancing 8 to 9 li, suddenly, a strong gust of wind flew towards Shi Linghu\u2019s throat. A cold light resembling something from hell flew over with a soul-crushing and lightning fast killing intent.This was a 1.3 meter long thick iron arrow. The terrifying power and speed of this projectile could undoubtedly penetrate a Dragon Horned Elephant\u2019s armor. Unsurprisingly, this was the reason why they were able to penetrate the three layered armor that the Stone Village men wore, and it was absolutely terrifying.Suddenly from within the depths of the mountain jungle, a similarly terrifying and cold arrow shot out. It was impossible to effectively defend against it, however, Shi Linghu who was brave and ferocious, surpassed all expectations. With lightning quick reactions, he moved sideways.It was beyond dangerous, and this ice-cold iron arrow scraped his neck, carrying along a string of blood with it. A little bit of skin was ripped open by the arrowhead; just a bit more and the arrow would have instantly bore through the neck.Just now, a sharp whistle sounded. This was the sonic boom caused by the iron arrow, much slower than the arrow itself. This showed just how terrifying the speed was.Qiang!The iron arrow did not enter the lump of boulder far away, instead, it went straight through it. The friction caused sounds of metal clashing and sparks flying, and it was extremely terrifying. What kind of of tyrannical strength was this? This type of heavy arrow, how many people dared to oppose it? If you were actually hit by it, then it would definitely make your heart stop cold!The scene was absolutely silent. Shi Linghu felt the scraped skin on his neck, and his cold eyes flickered. He barely managed to avoid death.In a faraway mountain region, a youth held his bow on the ground with a cold complexion. A grim light flickered in his eyes as he stared in this direction.\u201cIt\u2019s that child again!\u201d At that moment, Shi Feijiao and the others\u2019 anger broke through the heavens. This indifferent youth successively inflicted serious injuries to all the capable men of the village.This was a 14 or 15 year old youth, and he was rather tall-bodied with soft black shiny hair. His skin was fair and he was quite handsome, only that his eyes were unremorseful. This took away from his beauty and gave people a kind of wild and cruel feeling.Behind him, 70 or 80 people were currently dragging huge beasts one after the other, leaving a trail of blood on the mountain floor. Grass and bramble were all being crushed underneath.\u201cChild of Wolf Village, besides shooting some scary arrows, what else can you do? Come here if you have the guts, I\u2019ll peel off your head with one palm.\u201d A few people furiously roared.That\u00a0pretty\u00a0youth blinked his cold eyes, drew his bow, and aimed straight at him.Upon seeing this, Shi Linghu did not utter a single word. His hand held a large black bow made of a Dragon\u2019s Horn that was roughly half a person long, and quickly extended his bowstring. He armed his iron arrow and immediately released it.Dang!Two thick arrows collided in midair, causing sparks to fly out and extremely sharp ear piercing sounds. The two arrows simply neutralized each other before falling straight to the ground.Everyone took in a breath of cold air. That youth\u2019s archery skills were too abnormal. Not even 20 yet, and was able to fight toe to toe with the village\u2019s strongest male, Shi Linghu.Qiang, Qiang\u2026In the forest, sparks flew in all directions. Over ten iron arrows all collided with each other and made metallic sounds. Like a meteor shower, one after another fell to the ground, rupturing people\u2019s eardrums.These godly arrows startled the entire desolate forest.The strongest male in the village, Shi Linghu, was evenly matched with this youth, and neither had the advantage over the other, startling the group of people watching. Using both his arms, this youth could probably lift up a copper cauldron at least 5 or 6 thousand jin.This made people take in a breath of cold air. Such a formidable genius. He was a later generation youngster, yet he was able to produce such shocking godlike strength. This made people fear for their lives.\u201cFriends from Stone Village, forgive us. This time we require a large amount of ferocious beasts. Give us the prey this time and you will be rewarded in the future.\u201d A middle aged man appeared and yelled out in a loud and clear voice.\u201cIn order to steal our prey, you ran our clansman out of our own territory in the middle of the road with such vicious intents. Each arrow you shot penetrated our organs and gravely injured s many, yet you ask for forgiveness? Such a malicious act, and you act so passively, what is the reason behind your actions?\u201d Shi Linghu angrily rebuked.\u201cAfter a dispute, conflicts would arise and there would naturally be bloodshed. Even a negligent child would understand this fact.\u201d Wolf Village\u2019s hunting squad captain said,\u201cUnaccepted, bring it on!\u201d An even tougher lower-ranked male from Wolf Village said.The people from Stone Village all felt as if they were going to explode. Wolf Village ruthlessly attacked and even stole Stone Village\u2019s prey, yet they were still so overbearing and didn\u2019t even try to reason, there really weren\u2019t any good things to say about the current situation.\u201cThen let\u2019s fight!\u201d Shi Feijiao bellowed.\u201cWhy would we be scared of you guys?\u201d The captain of Wolf Village\u2019s hunting squad replied. He appeared quite imposing, and with a height of 2.34 meters, he gave off an oppressing aura.Qiang, Qiang\u2026The sound of weapons clashing unceasingly rang out. Groups of people heaved around broadswords that were roughly half their height, and with the flickering of cold light, murderous aura permeated the air. The shockwaves caused the leaves in the forest to scatter down from the trees.\u201cWe urge you to return to where you came from. If you dare take another step, i\u2019ll kill you all with one arrow. This time there won\u2019t be any mercy!\u201d The handsome youth from Wolf Village said. His words incited anger, and made people wish he were the one shot by an arrow instead.Shi Linghu angrily said, \u201cChild, you\u2019re not even an adult, yet you\u2019re so skillful and already quite formidable. However, by acting so domineering and in such a heated fashion, this won\u2019t end nicely for you.\u201dAt the same time, he arched his bow and shot straight ahead. Since communications between them had already reached such a point, what else could they do? Only war!Dang!The iron arrows collided once again, causing the mountain to buzz and vibrate.\u201cKill!\u201dEveryone from Stone Village extended their huge bows, held their broadswords, and spun their wolf-toothed clubs. They were as uninhibited as fierce beasts as they swept up gales while rushing forward like leaves dancing in the breeze.The people from Wolf Village were all tall and strong. They rushed head on as well, and a battle royale was on the verge of unfolding.At this time, a small silhouette similar to a small sparrow rapidly dashed to the front and yelled out in a loud voice, \u201cYou people steal the food that we depend on to survive and also wanted to kill my uncle. Uncle and the others are such kindhearted and good people, you people are all evil!\u201dShi Hao\u2019s little face was flustered red from being so stirred up. His hands were clasped tightly together, and his eyes were filled with a fiery anger. Since childhood, he had been raised in Stone Village and had been surrounded by warmth and comfort. Never had he faced such barbaric people before.Everyone within Wolf Village was astonished, and then they began to laugh loudly. They did not expect that apart from a few youths, Stone Village also had these kind of children following along. Won\u2019t this just be an inconvenience for the rest of them?Xiu!An iron arrow flew out as if it was splitting apart the air. That 14 or 15 year old youth from v was still cold and indifferent. \u00a0He extended that terrifying large bow and aimed it straight at the little guy.Everyone from Stone Village shot flames out of their eyes, and they could not be any more furious. This was only a child, and the little guy\u00a0was usually clever and cute. The enemy actually treated a child with the same evil intent, making their hair stand up straight.Shi Linghu armed his bow with a large arrow at once. He destroyed that youth\u2019s iron arrow; however, his expression instantly worsened.This was because this time, the youth shot four arrows at once. Four streaks of cold light flew through the air as fast as lightning, but Shi Linghu only had enough time to break three arrows. The enemy was even stronger than he imagined.Dang, Dang\u2026Among them, three arrows collided together, dropping straight to the floor. There was still another 1.3 meter long large iron arrow heading straight towards the little guy\u2019s throat. The cold tranquility made people fear.The little guy\u00a0used his hands to grab the iron arrow, shocking the villagers and exclaimed \u201cStay out of my way!\u201dThey knew that Shi Hao was gifted with incredible natural talent, but he was not even four years old. Although he lifted up a thousand jin copper cauldron, the enemy\u2019s experience was even greater. His force was alarmingly strong, able to lift 5 or 6 cauldrons, on par with Shi Linghu.\u201cYou even made a move against a child?!\u201d Stone Village\u2019s people eyes were popping out of their sockets.Dang!However, even more astonishing was the fact that the little guy\u2019s left hand chopped the arrow shaft in half, making it fly away on a tilt. It made a group of people mouth agape and speechless, unable to utter a single word.There were only a few people who had seen symbol flashing on his palm before it rapidly faded away.Whoosh.The little guy\u00a0jumped forward, and directly threw himself towards that youth from Wolf Village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was only a child, yet he was able to brush away the arrow with one hand. The youth could not help but feel that this was a bit inconceivable.One must understand that just by raising his two hands, he was able to lift five or six copper cauldrons. With thick arrows that could split rocks and crack gold, that tyrannical strength was not\u00a0something an ordinary person could resist, as it was enough to kill a Dragon Horned Elephant.The\u00a0people from Wolf Village\u00a0were all shocked. Nobody knew better than they did how scary Bei Feng was, as he was gifted with superior natural talent and an extremely rare divine strength. How could such a young child block Bei Feng\u2019s iron arrow?!\u201cYou are courting death!!\u201d The young Bei Feng lightly scoffed.\u00a0The light beams within his eyes shot out as if they were two streaks of lightning. He loudly exhaled, drew his bow, and began to continuously shoot out arrows.Chi, Chi\u2026Iron Arrows\u00a0pierced through the vast sky with\u00a0wuwu\u00a0sounds, as if they were\u00a0ghastly sounds from the ninth level of hell.\u00a0The thick arrow shafts emitted a metallic radiance that made people\u2019s heart tremble as it rapidly flew over; it was extremely terrifying.Bei Feng continuously\u00a0drew\u00a0his bow\u00a0until he released\u00a0eight iron arrows.\u00a0As they whistled\u00a0through the air, each and every arrow\u00a0were extremely terrifying, targeting only the little guy\u2019s vitals!Shi Hao like an alert ape,\u00a0dropped down onto\u00a0his four limbs.\u00a0With natural movements, he quickly\u00a0dodged 5\u00a0of the\u00a0arrows. Afterwards, he used both hands to\u00a0hack apart\u00a0the other three arrows\u00a0as the others\u00a0embedded themselves deep into\u00a0the mountain\u00a0boulder\u00a0with\u00a0keng qiang\u00a0sounds.This performance completely shocked everyone there!Even Stone Village\u2019s people were stupefied, as Shi Hao\u2019s display far exceeded their expectation.\u00a0To do all this at such a young age, this really made them feel as if this was surreal.Bei Feng\u2019s\u00a0mouth lightly shouted, and he furiously drew his bow. Those iron arrows shot out like a torrential rain as it poured down, and thick and long iron arrows penetrated one after another into the mountain forest.Although Shi Hao was quite young,\u00a0his speed was incredibly fast.\u00a0Leaping like a tiger and soaring like a dragon, he evaded the\u00a0rain of\u00a0arrows. At the same time, he used both hands to smack the arrows, knocking the\u00a0arrow shafts\u00a0into each other.\u00a0As the arrows collided with each other,\u00a0dang dang\u00a0sounds rang out, causing the arrows in the sky to tremble.His quickness did not resemble that of a child at all.\u00a0He closed the gap in between them in the blink of an eye. His motions made him look like a young\u00a0Gold Winged Peng, and exerted an atypical imposing manner.Dong!The chaotic rain of arrows became more and more concentrated. The little guy\u00a0shouted loudly,\u00a0and\u00a0kicked a thousand jin boulder\u00a0along the way. With a loud bang, it soared through the air straight towards\u00a0the cold-faced youth, Bei Feng.\u201cHow can he have this much strength, this child\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0even 4 years old yet\u201dThe people were terrified, as this simply made them flabbergasted. Only a few\u00a0individuals\u00a0have\u00a0vaguely\u00a0seen Shi Hao use his incredible strength. With his symbols lit up, he was\u00a0too\u00a0fast.The thousand jin rock shrouded the sky,\u00a0and smashed\u00a0straight down.Bei Feng eyes suddenly became\u00a0cold and stopped releasing arrows. He spun his large bow\u00a0that had\u00a0the height of half a person,\u00a0and with a\u00a0Hong\u00a0sound, this heavy rock was instantly ruptured, dispersing in all directions!However, Shi Hao had already grabbed a hold of this opportunity. He leaped forwards before angrily saying, \u201cWhy are you so rude and unreasonable, shooting\u00a0my uncle\u00a0with such killing intent and also stealing the prey that we need in order to survive.\u201dBei Feng let out a cold grunt,\u00a0and\u00a0dropped his large bow\u00a0before grabbing a faint red colored bloody iron-forged lance.\u00a0With both hands gripping the\u00a0lance, he spared no strength and\u00a0thrusted\u00a0towards the little guy\u2019s chest.However,\u00a0at this moment, Shi Hao\u2019s body was\u00a0still facing\u00a0forwards in mid-air,\u00a0making it rather\u00a0difficult to dodge. The onlookers from Stone Village\u2019s hearts\u00a0almost bursted out of their chests. They all endlessly hated Bei Feng because all of his actions were incredibly malicious.Qiang!The metallic sound vibrated through the air,\u00a0and\u00a0Shi Hao\u2019s expression was bright and clear. With a rotation of his right hand, he drew a graceful arc with flawless technique. With a\u00a0Qiang\u00a0sound, he cut the pike in half. Those white and tender small hands did not seem to have any injuries on them at all.The results left everyone dumbstruck. The young Shi Hao was against the tyrannical Bei Feng, yet he was not at in a disadvantage at all. As he closed the distance between them, his performance was incredible.Wu\u2026Bei Feng furiously flung his snapped pike, piercing it straight toward\u00a0the little guy\u2019s right eye, firm and strong. At such close range, this attack was extremely dangerous.Shi Hao tilted his head to dodge. While his body was still in midair, he delivered a roundhouse kick with his right leg, aiming straight for the side of Bei Feng\u2019s face, bringing along with it a strong gust of wind. Despite his small stature, his body was quite graceful. His movements were flowing naturally like a spirited swallow gliding through the air.\u201cBang\u201dBei Feng used his left arm to block, the dull sound of it echoing through the air. It shook the nearby forest, causing leaves to fly wildly like an autumn wind sweeping through.\u201cSuch strong power!\u201dThe\u00a0Wolf Villagers\u00a0let out a look of disbelief. They were fully aware of the astounding godly strength that Bei Feng possessed. He was still young, and within a circumference of a thousand li, few could match him. Right now, however, he did not have any advantage.Shi Hao dropped to the floor. He was still young, and was much shorter than Bei Feng; however, he was not afraid at all. His small face was fuming, large eyes wide open, confronting his enemy.Both sides stopped fighting. They were more interested in the confrontation between the formidable youth and the shocking child, waiting to see the results of the fight.Bei Feng\u2019s face grew gloomy and showed a hint of coldness out of his eyes. He was already 14 years old, but the previous collision against a child who wasn\u2019t even 4 yet did not determine victory or defeat. To him, it was utter humiliation.Bang!Bei Feng\u2019s body was tall and slender. He fiercely displayed the strength of his legs, and like an iron pillar, he swept across. The strength was so fearful that it caused a boom that sounded like a huge monster striking.Shi Hao fell back. He had always been raised in Stone Village. Although he had zero actual experience with combat, he knew quite a bit about it. He dodged the spear point and hopped back several meters.However, Bei Feng had killed many fierce beasts, slaughtered strange birds, and shot formidable humans to death. In terms of actual combat experience, he did not lack any. Naturally, he understood the advantage of striking first and maintaining the upper hand.He leaped in the air, and distanced himself by a couple of meters in an instant. He then rotated his right leg, and like a whip, he hacked forward. It was impossible to defend against, and a strong wind scraped against people\u2019s face, causing injuries.Behind him were a few ancient tree that blocked his retreat path, making dodging difficult. With his back against a huge tree, Shi Hao crossed his hands and did everything he could to support himself up. A few symbols shined momentarily.Boom!Like two huge beasts colliding into each other, rocks and sand were sent flying everywhere. Dust and smoke rushed to the sky, and leaves withered instantly. Both sides shook heavily. When Bei Feng\u2019s legs pressed down, the tree trunk with a diameter of 1 meter behind Shi Hao was cut right in half.With a rumble, the trees that reached into the sky snapped off and fell within the mountain with a sound loud enough to shock everyone.This time the\u00a0Wolf Village\u00a0clearly saw that in the middle of Shi Hao\u2019s palm was a shining symbol. It was this type of strength that was able to resist the innate strength of Bei Feng who attacked with the strength of over a thousand jin.\u201cTreasured Artifact, that child holds a rare treasured artifact!\u201d They all shouted out.No matter what, they could not believe Shi Hao had already familiarized himself with the formidable strength of mysterious symbols. They believed that it was because of the effect of the beast tooth bracelet around his wrist, because there was clearly a sparkling light flowing through.The Wolf Villagers\u2019 eyes all reddened. Although this was not an ancestral treasure, it was still a pretty good treasured artifact. It can augment a child\u2019s strength so much. Clearly, it was extraordinary.After breaking the huge tree with one kick, Bei Feng\u2019s approach did not changed one bit. His assault became even more ferocious. With both legs sweeping like an iron pillar, he constantly broke down giant trees. Broken branches and withered leaves flew about.Shi Hao did not back down and began to retaliate. Although he was small in stature, every time he jumped, he could reach a height of several meters. He flew forward like a baby Peng spreading its wings.Hong!The wind around Bei Feng\u2019s fist flew forward like thunder, and after Shi Hao dodged his strike, it struck the thousand jin mountain boulder behind him. He immediately blew it up into pieces, and sent rocks weighing hundreds or thousands of jin in all four directions.This scene was simply astonishing, as a youth that\u2019s just over 10 has this kind of fearful strength. All the onlookers took in a breath of cold air afterwards.The little guy was still small, and although his power can already be considered astonishingly god-like compared to his peers, his absolute strength was still less than Bei Feng\u2019s. However, with the assistance of the bone text\u2019s mysterious powers, he had nothing to fear either.\u2018Rabbits rising and falcons dropping\u2019, the two people were extremely nimble. Each strike carried terrifying power, and the wind around their fists were like thunder, creating rumbling sounds. The vibrations cause the forest to collapse and boulders to split.After exchanging ten strikes, Bei Feng\u2019s expression turned morbid. He was a genius blessed with talent from the heavens. He couldn\u2019t believe that he did not even have the upper hand against a child who was not even 4 yet. How could he endure this?Peng!After attacking with all of his strength this time, he suddenly bent down and lifted his head. Behind him, a wave of crossbow bolts flew over while flashing in a cold light, heading straight for the little guy\u2019s eyes and face.All the people of Stone Village cried in in alarm; this was too sudden. The group of people were all furious, as Bei Feng was simply too savage. This was merely a small child, and yet they were so shameless and had to commit such underhanded methods.The little guy was startled, but he was not scared. He waved both hands, and mysterious patterns appeared at his fingertip, forming a small crescent moon. He held the moon in the middle of his palms and threw it with all his might. Specks of light spread out, and broken every single crossbow bolt.The people of Stone Villages all let out a deep sigh of relief. The situation just now truly covered their bodies in cold sweat.\u201cThis youngster is too vicious. Letting him grow up will definitely be a disaster!\u201d Shi Feijiao angrily said.Bei Feng cursed inwardly, he still didn\u2019t manage to hit Shi Hao yet. He fiercely jumped six or seven meters high, and from this advantageous position, he stomped straight towards the little guy\u00a0with an unblockable force.Hu!Shi Hao\u2019s large eyes were clear as he decided to charge upwards. His palms were open like an eagle soaring through the sky. His movements were domineering and strong. His stance looked extremely similar to a Green Scaled Eagle breaking through the clouds.Hong!The crescent moon in the palm of his hands shined once again, and with glorious splendor, it flew straight out, meeting Bei Feng and heavily smashing into him, creating a tyrannical explosion.PuThis time, Bei Feng spat out blood. His body flew out horizontally, smashing many branches off of the huge trees before dropping onto the floor. The little guy immediately followed him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With his eyes lit, he looked down.With a\u00a0Hong\u00a0sound, the entire mountain floor lightly trembled. The formidable youth, Bei Feng, was once again on his back.The Wolf Villagers were all shocked. Bei Feng was an outstandingly talented youth, and he was revered by his entire clan. They could not believe that he lost just like this; furthermore, he lost to a young child.Many people from Wolf Village armed their bows with the intent to kill Shi Hao, wanting to improve the situation.Shi Feijiao and the others were furious, and they all armed their own bows as well, aiming at the other party. This was the beginning of a rough battle.With a\u00a0Hu\u00a0sound, Shi Hao grabbed Bei Feng\u2019s collar and lifted him up in front of him like a shield. He placed the body in front of the people from the Wolf Clan to protect himself.Bei Feng was incredibly angry. He could no longer maintain his usual gloomy and cool-headed composure, and could no longer control himself. Today, he was inflicted with extraordinary shame and humiliation. Being caught like this by an infant was a feeling worse than being killed. Struggling with all his strength, he punched towards the little guy.Although Shi Hao lacked sufficient experience, his hands and eyes were quick. With a wave of his hand, symbols rotated as he slapped Bei Feng on the stomach first, vibrating his entire body. Bei Feng\u2019s mouth filled with blood and his fist lost its strength.The little guy didn\u2019t stop here. He lifted Bei Feng who was a lot taller than he was and rapidly rushed towards Shi Linghu and the others.Bei Feng\u2019s body was slender, and more than half his body was being dragged across the ground through thistles and rocks while being carried like this. With dishevelled hair, compared to that handsome cold youth from before, it was like the difference between heaven and earth. He couldn\u2019t bear the current situation.While he was still a distance of around 8 to 9 meters away, the little guy fiercely tossed Bei Feng out of his hands, and with a splat, Bei Feng landed in front of Shi Linghu and the others. He rolled a few times before he spat out some blood. His eyes were filled with anger.\u201cChild, weren\u2019t you acting quite vicious before? Keep acting arrogant, why stop!\u201d After Shi Feijiao finished talking, he took large steps and then stepped on Bei Feng, making a cracking sound. Bei Feng \u2018s sternum immediately snapped.Their strengths were similar, but right now, Bei Feng was a lowly prisoner who naturally could not resist due to having his sternum broken. The pain was so intense that he began groaning and sweating profusely.\u201cLittle guy, you\u2019re too kindhearted. Just then, when facing the enemy, you had plenty of chances to injure him and missed them all. Then after capturing him, your methods were too light. Doing things this wayis very dangerous.\u201d Shi Linghu was teaching him on the side.\u201cYiya!\u201d The little guy a bit embarrassed, and almost seemed to be a completely different person from the little tiger before. This was the first time he fought with all of his strength, and the only reason he acted this way was due to seeing his uncle wounded after almost being shot to death. The enemy was too barbaric, and that\u2019s why he urgently engaged in the fight.\u201cGreetings, friends from Stone Village, show some mercy, ask for whatever comes to mind. We can talk things over.\u201d The Wolf Villagers were anxious. This kind of potential was shockingly desolate in a youth. If he were to die, their clan would suffering huge losses.\u201cNow you want to talk? You steal our prey that we worked so bitter and hard for and attempted to kill our clansmen. When you ruthlessly and cold-bloodedly shot at us, why didn\u2019t you think of the consequences?! \u201d Shi Linghu angrily said.Peng!On the other side, Shi Feijiao directly stomped his foot again.\u00a0Kacha.\u00a0One of the bones in Bei Feng\u2019s arms was snapped off, causing his face to become twisted. However, he still didn\u2019t mutter a word.\u201cDon\u2019t! Stop! Everything is our fault, can\u2019t we apologize for our crimes again?\u201d An elder from the Legendary Wolf Clan yelled out anxiouslyEven their hunting squad captain yelled loudly, wanting to negotiate. He was a towering individual of 2.34 meters and was normally an oppressing and imposing person, however, right now he was no longer the unyielding and overbearing person he was earlier.\u201cYour mom and dad\u00a0we\u00a0talk. We don\u2019t care about anything else, we\u2019ll beat him up first!\u201d Er Meng\u2019s father said this in\u00a0a spitting rage. These days, everyone in Stone Village held back a stomach full of fire. How can this end in just one sentence?Hong!His fan-like palm dropped down in an arc and slapped right on Bei Feng\u2019s face. It directly lacerated a part of his flesh, and his whole body flew over 10 meters horizontally .\u201cYou brat, you dare to scowl at me. Four or five of my brothers were almost killed by you. Each arrow malicious and penetrated their inner organs. Where\u2019s your arrogant strength now! Show me!\u201dPengWhen Bei Feng rolled under Shi Linghu\u2019s feet, he also used his legs to kick out with the force of several thousand jin, which was enough to kick a ferocious beast to death. Despite Bei Feng being so strong, he also had a few bone broken. His mouth twitched, and blood spilt out like water.Not long ago, his arrogance was insulting, callous and tyrannical. Right now he became a prisoner under their feet. His head was cracked, his hair was messed up, his body bloodied, and he was completely silent. The discrepancy was too huge.PengEveryone from Stone Village hated his previous attitude bitterly. That type of grim and arrogant person made everyone\u2019s teeth itch. Now, everyone got a chance to give a piece of revenge, you get a kick and I get a kick. Living in such a desolate place, every person had a well-built physique. After a round of this, Bei Feng was almost tore apart. Who knew how many of his bones had snapped or had gone soft.\u201cStop!\u201dThe Wolf Villagers grew increasingly anxious and armed their huge bows, and wanted to exert pressure to alleviate the situation because if this continued, even Bei Feng will become a cripple and lose all hope in rising up as a genius.\u201cAll of you, stop and go stand on the side, we are not done with him. Let us take out our anger on him \u00a0before we talk!\u201d Shi Feijiao said.Everyone gave a kick and a slap. Not long after, Bei Fen was tossed so much that he quickly lost a human form. His nose was bloodied, his face was swollen, and bones were broken everywhere. He had a miserable appearance and no longer had that a trace of that callous expression.At this precise time, a group of children rushed up, especially Pi Hou. He kicked him with all his might and said: \u201cYou almost shot my father to death. Who cares if you are arrogant, so what! Weren\u2019t you still captured by the little guy!\u201d\u201cOur clan\u2019s little guy is only a bit older than three years old, you\u2019re over 10 years old. You are not even able to beat him. Do you still believe you can act violent and stand above others?\u201d The group of children were beating him up while taunting him.Now, a group of people surround Shi Hao, and were not stingy in showing their praise. Not even the people of Stone Village thought that he was this strong, and was able to directly capture a youth whose terrifying strength was on par with Shi Linghu.\u201cFriends from Stone Village, did you get rid of your anger yet? This should be good enough right?\u201d Everyone from Wolf Village was getting worried. If this continued, a genius would be turned into a cripple. After that, what difference would there be between him and a dead dog?\u201cAlright fine, let\u2019s discuss then!\u201dShi Linghu sat his buttocks on Bei Feng\u2019s body and completely made him his horse. This made the people from Wolf Village want to rip their own hearts out. That strong man, nearly 2.5 meters in height using that much strength to sit, even an oxen would collapse.But under under the house of another, they had to yield and could only use kind words to persuade. They did not dare show their resentment.\u201cWe are friends that live in the middle of this desolate land. Even if we had a few disagreements, we will still see each other often. We beg you to forgive us of our recklessness this time.\u201d A rather eloquent man from Wolf Village\u2019s hunting squad said.\u201cMy ass, what do you mean we meet with each other so often. Everything is so easy to say. What were you doing before? Why did you want to kill our clansmen?!\u201dShi Feijiao criticized.With a wave of his hand, Shi Linghu said: \u201cStop speaking bullshit, we don\u2019t want to hear it. Tell us, how will you compensate us?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe Wolf Villagers all frowned. The captain of the hunting squad said: \u201cWe will make amends and apologize here, and we will give all the prey to you. How about that?\u201dEr Meng\u2019s father rolled his eyes and said: \u201dThe prey was originally ours. You injured so many of us. You think just gifting us some stuff will make us even?\u201d\u201cAlright fine. From now on, we\u2019ll leave this part of the mountain, and we\u2019ll never cross into your territory again. We\u2019ll also return all of the prey back to you. How about that?\u201dA person from Wolf Village said.\u201cBullshit! These were what we had before. After all this talk, you do not have a speck of sincerity!\u201d A person with poor temperament from Stone Village shouted.Shi Linghu waved his hand and said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk with you guys anymore. It\u2019s alright for us to release this youth, but in addition to everything stated before, leave behind all the weapons you have on you. Only then can you carry him back, and don\u2019t ever appear in front of us again.\u201d\u201cWhat, no way!\u201d The people from Wolf Village shouted. To them, weapons were like their second life. Living in the middle of the mountain, they could not survive without these weapons.One must be aware that there are very few metal deposits here, and it was very difficult to extract any. It was very difficult to obtain even one handy weapon, and it took a long time to smelt and polish.\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing more to talk about. Someone come and chop this kid\u2019s brain off for me and bring it back to Wolf Village.\u201d Shi Linghu bellowed.\u201cOkay!\u201d A youthful and loud voice responded, and with a broadsword, he swung down to behead Bei Feng.\u201cDon\u2019t do it, we agree!\u201d An important person from Wolf Village shouted hurriedly to stop him.The faces of the other people from Wolf Village turned ugly. \u201cDo we really have to give away all these weapons?\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t have weapons, we can make more. Although it is time-consuming, in the end we will still have some hope, but people\u2026, we cannot resurrect them. Bei Feng\u2019s potential is extremely high. In these large and desolate lands, a person of his caliber is rare. In the future, it will be him who protects our clan.\u201dThe people from Wolf Village all compromised and piled up the iron arrows, Dragon Horned Bows as well as the sharp broadswords one after another. Their hearts were all bleeding.Originally, there should have been a blood battle, however, with the sudden appearance of the little guy confronting the dreadful innate talent of Bei Feng, the battle changed, and a bloody conflict was avoided. Otherwise, no one knew how many people would have died.The group of people returned from their bountiful journey back to Stone Village.The following days, Stone Village was quite peaceful. However, the depths of the mountain was certainly not calm. Often, the cries of beasts shocked the sky and shook the entire mountain, causing avalanches.\u201cChief, sooner or later that dreadful Suan Ni from the heart of the mountain will die. Recently, it continuously roared and struggled.\u201dA person came and reported directly to Shi Yunfeng.\u201cThat is perhaps a true species of an archaic descendant. It could be considered powerful even within the depths of the mountain. If we could somehow obtain its remains, extract its true blood and copy down its skeleton\u2019s primitive symbols, then it could undoubtedly be considered a heaven shocking treasure!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the face of such a goldmine, who would not be tempted to snatch the precious resource for themselves?\u201cHmm such a treasure really makes one\u2019s eyes glow with greed, almost to the point of charging in right away and snatching away both true blood and original precious symbols in one fell swoop\u201d, a group of adolescent youths were eager to get in on the action..\u201cEven if that Suan Ni is gradually growing older, it\u2019s still not something we are capable of handling. Do not act rashly and wait patiently.\u201d The chief\u2019s face revealed a concentrated expression and solemnly warned.\u201cHaha, this time the reaped rewards are truly great! The little guy has really outdone himself this time around. It\u2019s thanks to him that we managed to avoid a bloodbath\u201d, a group of people praised.\u201cAhhhh\u2026\u201d\u00a0The little guy put on an embarrassed face and scratched his head in confusion. A loud noise emanated in the distance, drawing the attentions of Zi Yun, Da Peng, Xiao Qing to run to the spot.Boom!Atop the clouds a giant bird swooped down and scales flickered with a cold light. The great Green Scaled Eagle eagle had appeared! With a great\u00a0Hong\u00a0sound, it dropped from its talons a giant fire rhinoceros in the village outskirts. Every so often it would come back and drop a huge prey.The hatchlings had been born for almost two months now, and their bodies grew rapidly, approaching 2.5 meters in size. Its body grew sleeker and stronger, and with both wings fully extended, they could almost fly.\u201cLittle Zi and the others, quickly grow up. When you guys grow up, take me with you to see what the depths of the mountain range looks like.\u201d The little guy stroked their necks, and their eyes flashed a glimmer of hope to what they one day may become. Afterwards he once again started examining the ancestral treasured symbols of the three birds in front of him, in hopes of understanding the unique and mysterious power belonging to their speciesWeng!A noise shook the air, and soon after a soft yet holy silver moon emerged from the center of his palm and began to spread its clear splendor. Afterwards, the silvery moon began to rise before rotating to the back of his head, making the little guy seem extraordinary.During the last confrontation with Bei Feng, he only form a part of the precious symbol into his palm and did not use the complete silver moon. Otherwise, its power would be even more formidable.The silver moon rotated and revolved around him. Pure white light scattered around him, making the little guy appear unspeakably holy.\u201cYiya, I figured out a bit more now. On the moon, there\u2019s a huge bird living within a palace. Could it be that that\u2019s Zi Yun, Da Peng and the other\u2019s ancestor \u2014 that Archaic Devil Bird?\u201d Shi Hao muttered to himself.On that silver moon rests a tree, as well as a palace with mysterious and complex patterns. Currently, the little guy had already made some progress while studying the secret bone texts and was able to understand a bit more about the patterns.He released the silver moon, and the complete precious moon disk was brandished in bright and shining light. From within the palace rang a bird cry, and that tree began to shake and scatter out its clear splendor.The silver moon did not look like it was constructed from the symbols, and appeared too real. It was as if the moon in the sky fell down, truly life-like.QiangA metallic sound rang out, as if the bestowed ancestral treasures that had previously been gathering dust were reborn. A\u00a0kang qiang\u00a0sound rang out, and the radiance was pure and holy.The silver moon circled around a five or six meter wide boulder, and with a\u00a0kacha\u00a0sounds, the boulder split open, making a clean and glossy cut. It didn\u2019t disappear, and once again shot out and cult two more boulders before fading away.\u201cYa,\u00a0last time it only managed to split a single boulder. Now it can cut three, how powerful!\u201d The little guy opened his mouth in amazement.The silver moon flickered with symbols and became much more concentrated compared to before. The palace and the tree were vaguely visible, sharp and lifelike. Its strength increased by a whole level.\u201cThe little guy is so formidable, he can release such a powerful disk. I feel that his strength is sufficient to face those desolate beasts within the mountains.\u201d After seeing this display, some of the children began to become incredibly envious.\u201cWu,\u00a0after seeing how terrifying that Archaic Devil Bird was, if it manages to pass down its imprints intact, it will definitely be a divine skill. However, this is quite a rare event.\u201d The chief spoke.This type of powerful attack can be considered a Precious Technique. A technique that will usually be kept as a precious secret!\u201cAfter such a long time, my clan can finally be considered to have a Precious Technique.\u201d Some of the elder were beginning to feel a bit emotional.These types of Precious Technique would normally only be in the hands of powerful clans. If not for the little guy raising these Green Scaled Eagles and carefully researching them from a close distance, it would be impossible to obtain it.\u201cWe still don\u2019t know what the situation regarding Suan Ni. If it really is dying from old age and we manage to obtain its remains, then that will signify us obtaining another Precious Technique.\u201d\u201cThe stronger the Archaic Descendant species, the more it would protects its secrets. Especially the imprints of its Ancestral Treasured Symbols, which would likely be destroyed before death.\u201d Shi Yunfeng frowned.It is precisely because of this reason that Ancestral Treasured Symbols were so rare and precious. It was truly uncommon, as it represented a species\u2019 major inheritance and that there was a chance of obtaining a Precious Technique.\u201cI really hope that Suan Ni doesn\u2019t destroy its own precious bones, as those are from a genuine Archaic Descendant \u2026 The Precious Technique it holds must be astonishingly powerful!\u201d Shi Linhu said.The Chief shook his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be too greedy. For our clan to unexpectedly obtain a Precious Technique is already quite fortunate.\u201dFour days later, a world-shaking roar rang out, and shook all of the mountains and ravines . All of the wild creatures were trembling with fear as they groveled on the floor, and all of the vicious birds fled to the skies. The mountain boulders rolled about, and thousands of trees swayed back and forth as the entire forest trembled.That Suan Ni came out from within the depths of the mountains and arrived in the surrounding area. Since it was on the verge of death, it wanted to find a place of rest. Its power and influence were extremely frightening.\u201cIt really is about to die from old age. Most likely, it will be within one or two days!\u201dStone Village was bustling. If they managed to obtain that Suan Ni\u2019s corpse, then that would be a tremendous treasure deposit. The quality of its true blood would be astonishing beyond belief, and that would truly be blood medicine.\u201cWu, it really is an Archaic Descendant. If the blood vessels are pure enough, then the little guy\u2019s baptism will depend on it.\u201d Even Shi Yunfeng couldn\u2019t remain calm anymore. He paced back and forth rather excitedly. He really wanted to go and take it right now.\u201cSend some people to carefully scout the area. We need to prepare well and be ready to leave at any time!\u201d Several of the elders couldn\u2019t sit still any longer. They were nervous, excited, worried, and it was hard for them to calm down.As for Shi Linhu, Shi Feijiao and some other robust men, they were even more anxious and their eyes were turning red.\u201cI saw that Suan Ni tear apart a bunch of vicious beasts and turned that area of the forest into a forbidden zone. There aren\u2019t even any tracks of beasts or birds left.\u201dA day later, a villager ran back to the village and reported the terrifying scene that he saw when he stood far away on top of a mountain peak.Chief Shi Yunfeng suddenly turned his body around and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we need to start moving. However, we must carefully prepare this time, as we will most likely not be the only ones. There will be other creatures and villagers fighting over it.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Chief, I am going too!\u201d The little guy begged.The villagers did not object, as his current fighting strength was already quite frightening. Although he was extremely young, he was already able to grasp a precious method. At a crucial moment, he could display his divine might.Jiu JiuDa Peng, Xiao Qing, Ah Zi gathered in front and rubbed their heads against his arm. They showed their intimacy and wanted to tag along as well.\u201cBe good, don\u2019t be so noisy, it\u2019s very dangerous within the mountains. You guys haven\u2019t grown up yet, and cannot go take such risks. Wait for me here at home, when I come back, I\u2019ll bring you guys to catch and eat some fish.Shi Hao pacified the three little birds and at the same time warned them. He needed to persuade the Green Scaled Eagle to help him again when the time was right. Since the expedition to seek out the precious body of the Suan Ni was quite dangerous, if he had the help of a formidable vicious bird, everything would become a lot smoother.\u201cLet\u2019s go, to the mountains!\u201dA group of people entered the mountains with their head held high towards the cemetery of the Suan Ni.Hong!The entire earth shook and the mountain quaked, and it seemed as if an earthquake occurred within the depths of the mountain, making the entire mountain tremble. It was truly a terrifying scene.\u201cChief, the Suan Ni is at the end of its lifespan and at death\u2019s door. It entered a mountain cave and caused a cave-in. A few villagers ran back to rapidly and loudly report the circumstances.\u201cGo, we need to move faster!\u201d Shi Yunfeng shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Suan Ni\u2019s life force had been completely exhausted as it passed away, meaning that an entire body of true blood and precious bones had become priceless treasures. How could they not be excited?\u201cFaster, we are moving too slow!\u201d Shi Linghu and the others were anxious. They feared that they would arrive late, since \u2018the early bird catches the worm\u2019.Lofty mountain peaks surrounded them one after the other. The mountains were endless, and the ancient forest was extremely astonishing. The tree tops towered into the towers as they reach over 1000 meters tall. They overshadowed some of the mountains, and were \u2018hiding the sky and covering the earth\u2019. Even vine grew for who knows how long, and even several adults could not wrap themselves around them. They grew alongside the mountains like a vigorous and young horned dragon.The people of Stone Village madly rushed to get there, and when they arrived near the place where the Suan Ni perished, they felt a baleful aura. The aura was overbearing, and it was what the King of Ten Thousand Beasts left behind.\u201cSo quiet!\u201d Everyone felt that something was abnormal. This place was too tranquil, and not a sound could be heard, making it feel as if they were in a graveyard.There wasn\u2019t even a single bird present let alone ordinary beasts. Even the bugs and ants hid themselves within the caves in seclusion. The mountain forest was desolate, silent, and had a death-like tranquility.\u201cBefore the Suan Ni died, it killed many vicious beats and started going crazy. The birds and animals here have all fled.\u201d Shi Linghu said.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong!\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng suddenly said in fright and immediately said in an urgent voice, \u201cLinghu, don\u2019t be in such a rush. The carcass of a Suan Ni is rare and precious, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only ones here. A few vicious beasts here are spying on us, so let\u2019s retreat for now and not act recklessly.He felt waves of dangerous aura, as if some powerful and desolate huge beast was approaching from afar. Its eyes were ice cold, and the old chief felt a chill on his spine, and immediately ordered the villagers to retreat.The little guy also felt this. His hairs stood up and he clenched his fists. Shi Hao also told everyone that he felt this sensation.Everyone rapidly scattered away, and did not approach that crumbled rock mountain.\u201cWe\u2019re just giving up like this\u2026 this is really is difficult to bear!\u201d Shi Feijiao smacked his own chest as he felt an incomparable urge to choke.\u201cLet\u2019s not rush in first, we must wait for an opportunity. A person\u2019s life is the most precious thing. Despite a Suan Ni\u2019s blood being incredibly frightening and possessing precious techniques that defies the heavens, we must still keep our lives to use them.\u201d Shi Yunfeng solemnly said.They sped up faster and faster, and climbed up onto a vantage point on a tall mountain. They surveyed the surrounding from afar, and paid close attention to the circumstances from there.There were a few traces of people. Sounds came out from that mountain nearby, and three groups of people came from different directions. Although they came from different directions, their goals were the same. They all rushed towards that crumbled rock mountain, wanting to excavate that Suan Ni\u2019s carcass.\u201cAs expected, it wasn\u2019t just us who lusted over the ancestral descendent Suan Ni\u2019s remains. Everyone who lives in this desolate area all paid attention to this.\u201dThe three groups of people came into contact, and without any provocations, they immediately conflicted, causing sounds of murder to disperse from within the middle of the mountains.\u201cAWOOOOO\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, five ferocious beasts appeared one after the other, and all of them were as big as houses. They all exposed their white carnivorous teeth, and suddenly pounced onto those groups of people who had the intention of fighting over the Suan Ni\u2019s carcass.At the same time, long cries could be heard from the birds in the sky. Violent gales erupted, and many vicious birds flew over. Each of them measured five to six meters long, and with a wingspan of over eleven or twelve meters, they dove down. Right away, over six or seven people were ripped apart as blood spilt everywhere.This bloody scene was horrifying, and not to mention the people who were personally experiencing this, even the people of Stone Village who were observing from afar were all scared. Soon after, the vicious birds and the ferocious beasts all retreated; this was an absolute disaster.\u201cAWOOOO!\u201dSure enough, beast cries could be heard occasionally from all over the mountains. The vicious birds and ferocious beasts who were scared away by the Suan Ni all came back. Their goals were to obtain the carcass of the Suan Ni and making themselves more powerful.Not only did this happen in this part of the mountain, even other mountains from afar had movements from tyrannical living creatures. Cries of birds and beasts were occurring all over the place, and the entire mountain range was heating up.All of the beasts began to revolt. The larger ones measured ten meters, and the small ones measured a few feet. In just a blink of an eye, over a few hundred of them appeared. These were all formidable species, otherwise, they would not dare to rush over. They resembled a flood as they swarmed over, violently howling along the way.The same situation was happening in the skies as well. All kinds of bird species fluttered about with their steel beaks and sharp claws, \u2018hiding the skies and covering the earth\u2019. It was like they were a gust of wind rushing towards this piece of the mountain as scales and feathers fluttered in the breeze.\u201cRun!\u201dThose three villages lost over forty people, and they all jumped into the middle of a river. They used the water as a mean of escape, otherwise, no one would be left alive.On the peak of the mountain, everyone from Stone Village who were observing all had a blank expression. They had previously thought there would be vicious beasts fighting over the remains of the Suan Ni King, but they never thought that there would be this many.Ahhh!Those who thought they were safe after jumping in the water let out a blood curdling scream. There were several snakes over ten meters long rolling about. They opened their bloody mouth and instantly swallowed four to five people.Kacha!On the other side, a gold colored crocodile over ten meters long showed its presence. It opened its vacuum like mouth and instantly tore five or six people apart. Blood flowed through the cracks of its white teeth, dyeing the river red.This sight made everyone\u2019s bones shiver. The survivors quickened their pace and didn\u2019t dare slow down again.\u201cSo terrifying, luckily we decided to temporarily retreat. Otherwise, we\u2019d likely end up in the situation as them.\u201d Ling Shihu still lingered in fear after finding out his back had been doused in his own cold sweat.\u201cLooks like this Suan Ni\u2019s body is much more precious than we thought, or else why would groups of birds and beasts fight over it with their lives.\u201d Shi Feijiao said.Over by the crumbled rock mountain, there were several hundred vicious beasts and birds of prey. They all fanatically battered ahead, wanting to dig one huge boulder after another to dig out the Suan Ni\u2019s precious remains. They were also fighting each other at the same time; the smell of blood entered their nostrils and all kinds of roars and cries were deafening.\u201cThere is too many fierce beasts, we\u2019re not safe here. We can\u2019t say for sure, but we might get involved.\u201d An elder exclaimed.AWWOOOO\u2026.After his words just finished, a violent gale erupted on the mountain. Two huge beasts suddenly appeared together. They were seventy or eighty meters long each and were covered in brown fur. The long and fearsome beasts appeared side by side.It was actually terrifying tigers, and two of them showed up at once!The tigers\u2019 upbringing were strange. They were disdained by their mothers and never drank any milk. They were discarded since their mortality rates were extremely\u00a0high. If they weren\u2019t starved to death, they would just be fed to other mountainous beasts. If by chance, one survives to grow up, its power would shake the entire mountain, eating all kinds of fierce beasts.Now, there were two tigers that appeared. This was truly shocking. They were much more difficult to deal with than normal fierce beasts.\u201cHUU\u201d, a violent wind blew by. One of the huge tigers took action and dove down. It opened its bloodied mouth, and all of a sudden bit two villagers.\u00a0Kacha, one of them had their body snapped in half. Blood spewing out violently, and it was truly a tragedy to behold.\u201cShi Lin!\u201d\u201cAh Yun!\u201dThe villagers all voiced out their sorrowful anger. Like rain, iron arrows were shot out.This was all too sudden. These savage tigers could fly and they measure seventy to eighty meters long. These kinds of huge monsters\u2019 sudden appearance wasn\u2019t something they could protect against. Naturally, they brought with them a bloody massacre.\u201cBastards!\u201dShi Linhu and Shi Feijiao roared loudly. The others brandished their broadswords and rushed forward. They brought with them a few strong, able-bodied males and charged in the direction of that huge tiger.Despite the fact that these species of animals did not have ancestral treasured symbols on their bones, their corporeal bodies were extremely strong and fearsome. Their killing power was unbelievable. On their normal hunts, the villagers made sure that they avoid these creatures at all cost.AWWWWOOOO\u2026The other tiger fearsomely roared and pounced from a different angle. With a wave of its claws, cold light flickered and the sound of ringing could be heard. Sparks flew in every direction, and broadswords as well as huge clubs flew out of the villagers\u2019\u2019 hands.PuAmong them, two people dodged a bit too slow, and their stomachs were tore apart. Blood spilled on the ground, and they suffered an unimaginably heavy injury. They were dragged towards the back by the other villagers.\u201cYou overgrown cat, give my uncle Yun and the others\u2019 lives back!\u201d \u00a0Shi Hao grew anxious and charged in with symbols on both arms lit up like a shining constellation. In the middle of his palm, specks of light formed and a disked silver moon appeared.This disked moon appeared very real, as if a godly moon fell from the ninth level of heaven. Holy light radiated everywhere and rapidly rushed towards a huge tiger.DANG!The huge tiger waved its huge fan-like claw, and cold light spewed everywhere as it clashed against the silver moon. The sound of metal could be heard, shaking the entire mountain.One must know that this silver moon could split huge boulders. Its strength was limitless, but just now, this huge tiger used its claws to shake it off.In this brief deadlock, with a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, this tiger let out a world shaking roar. One of its claws finally broke off, and blood poured out, painting the ground red.At the same time, that silver moon\u2019s strength did not decrease. With another\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, the moon chopped towards the tiger\u2019s head. All of a sudden, it cleaved a huge crack, and a terrifying wound continuously bled out.The beast\u2019s roar shook the sky and trembled the forest. This huge tiger shook violently, and with a look of disbelief, the light within its eyes gradually faded. With a rumble, it dropped into the middle of a pool of its own blood.This was in fact a precious technique of the Green Scaled Eagle, and its power was astonishing. With Shi Hao\u2019s one strike, it beheaded a terrifying huge tiger.\u201cGood shit! Little guy, do it again!\u201d Shi Feijiao shouted.Shi Hao turned around and charged towards the other tiger. With the light on his palms lit again, the terrifying power of the precious technique showed its horrifying might again. The silver moon streaked across the sky, and that seventy or eighty meter long huge tiger\u2019s neck started to bleed profusely. The silver light turned around, and chopped straight towards its head, and with a\u00a0gudong, it dropped onto the floor.That huge beast\u2019s blood spouted out like a river, splashing all over the villagers\u2019 bodies.\u201cSuch a terrifying precious technique!\u201dThis type of attack method was held in reverence by many of them.After the little guy killed the two huge tigers, he was caught in a daydream. This was still his first time in the forest killing a beast. He looked down on his white and tender little hands and spend a long time speechless.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, don\u2019t fear the smell of blood child. Which male growing up in these desolate mountains didn\u2019t come in contact with blood? Everyone\u2019s like this.\u201d Shi Linhu walked past and patted his shouldersShi Hao lifted his head with some effort. Even though his heart wasn\u2019t at peace, right now, he tightly shut his mouth and didn\u2019t speak too much. If he didn\u2019t just kill those huge tigers, many more villagers would have suffered death.\u201cPrecious techniques are truly difficult to comprehend. It can kill huge beasts and save people. If we can obtain the Suan Ni\u2019s ancestral symbols, it would truly be a great fortune.\u201d After a long while,\u00a0the little guy\u00a0finally muttered to himself.A loud bird cry sounded from the middle of the clouds, and a Green Scaled Eagle appeared before rapidly descending, bringing with it a fierce gust of wind.The little guy jumped up before waving his hands and yelling loudly, \u201cAuntie Green Scaled Eagle, help me! You\u2019re the overlord of the outer mountain region, and I can also help you a bit. Let\u2019s fight over the Suan Ni\u2019s precious techniques together!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It appeared cold and frightening, and the look in its eyes was deep as it gazed downwards.\u201cAunt Green, faster. There\u2019s not enough time.\u201d The little guy was on the mountain peak fiddling with his small hands as he shouted out in a loud voice.Violent gales whistled as the Green Scaled Eagle rapidly descended with its wings spread out to roughly fifty or sixty meters long. Like a black fog pressing downwards, it casted a large shadow, making the people\u2019s hearts palpitate.Shi Hao with a\u00a0whoosh\u00a0jumped five or six meters high and landed on the back of the eagle. He immediately felt a hard surface, and each of her scales were as cold and hard as metal.\u201cLittle guy, don\u2019t be too adventurous.\u201d The Chief loudly yelled. Everything happened so fast, and there wasn\u2019t any time to prevent Shi Hao from leaping upwards.\u201cGrandpa Chief, relax, we won\u2019t take that many risks. We\u2019ll only take action when we find the chance to.\u201d Shi Hao waved his little hand, signaling that there was no need to worry.\u201cLittle guy, you have to be careful! \u201c Shi Linghu yelled out. He knew that he couldn\u2019t prevent this little guy, and could only loudly warn him.\u201cUncle, I know. Grandpa chief, you guys go back first. This place is too dangerous. There are too many clans on the move, so opportunities won\u2019t be abundant anyway.\u201dThe villagers all immediately understood. This was a fact. Right now even if all the males at the prime of their lives were to go, they would drown in a sea of several hundred crazy and vicious beasts, and join the bloodbath in the mountain.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng waved and gave his command, otherwise, he might attract another disaster.\u201cLittle guy you must be careful!\u201d A person from the village yelled, warning him with his large voice.\u201cI know, Grandpa Chief, you guys must be careful too.\u201dThe Green Scaled Eagle hovered, and took off near the side of the mountains. Its speed was incredibly fast, and the wind sounded like thunder as it scraped their faces until injuries ensued; it was practically impossible to open one\u2019s eyes. The little guy Shi Hao laid flat on its back, and his two small hands tightly clung on to its cold, chilly scales as he squinted his eyes to view what is in the distance.\u201cAunt Green, be careful, there are many vicious beasts down there.The Green Scaled Eagle was exceptionally fast. With a flap of its wings, it quickly crossed over from one mountain peak to the other. The mountain trees collapsed, and huge trees were snapped. Broken branches and withered leaves flew everywhere.Over a hundred formidable vicious beasts were in combat, and over a hundred vicious birds smacking their wings as well. They didn\u2019t hold anything back, and even many boulders were smashed, causing a huge mess.The beasts roared, and the cries of birds echoed throughout the mountains. Blood spilled over the surface, dyeing the mountains a deep red. There were many enormous beasts that collapsed and were trampled on until they became a bloody pulp. The area reeked of blood.In front of the crumbled mountain, it was completely filled with dense living creatures that madly fought for superiority. Blood unceasingly spilled ten feet into the air as the creatures tried to dig out the huge boulder that was hiding the Suan Ni\u2019s body.There was a leopard in particular who measured over ten meters long that had a horn growing out of its head. It used its tyrannical strength to rip apart a huge beast\u2019s body with each strike, soaking it in blood. Its two incomparably sharp claws glittered with a metallic sheen as they doused in the blood of its prey.AOOO\u2026An especially large Kui (one-legged monster) roared like thunder. Its huge body measured an enormous twenty meters long as if it was a small mountain. Its weapon was its sound wave, and wherever it passed by, ferocious beasts were knocked out, and blood spilled in all directions.TL:PengAn eight or nine meter long silver pangolin, bore an immense and sharp horn on its head, and it was able to overcome anything. It dug out the mountain rocks, and ruptured them one after the other, directly digging through into the middle of the mountain.\u2026There were too many species and they were all incredibly formidable; otherwise, they would not have decided to participate as they were all intelligent.The huge beasts fought for supremacy, and the group of tyrannical creatures attacked each other as they all lusted over the carcass of the Suan Ni. If they were to devour it, they would become the king of the mountain.Hu!A mighty gust of wind whistled as the Green Scaled Eagle quickly rushed over. With both its huge metallic claws stretched forth, it grabbed straight for the eight or nine meter long silver pangolin with over half of its body was hidden under the surface since it was highly possible it would obtain the Suan Ni carcass first.With a\u00a0Pu\u00a0sound, even though the pangolin skin was akin to iron, it could not avoid being penetrated by the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s cold and shiny pair of claws. Its blood sprinkled out of its body.A large bellow passed through the middle of the mountain, and the silver pangolin went mad. It crazily swung its tail, and at the same time, it dug itself out of the rocks. It stood up and thrusted its two meter long huge horn towards the Green Scaled Eagle.However, the Green Scaled Eagle had even once forced the people of Stone Village to use their Ancestral Artifacts. One must know that these were treasured artifacts made from the kings of Archaic Descendants passed through the generations.Both its wings struck the sky, and in a flash, it rose up. Of course, its two claws did not let go. Like before, it held the pangolin by the tail and rapidly ascended up to the clouds.In this course of events, winds rolled as if it were thunder. The pangolin\u2019s struggles were all proven worthless, and without using the floor to assert its full strength, it was hard for it to wound the fierce bird.Suddenly, after ascending to the clouds, the Green Scaled Eagle released its huge claws. The pangolin fell dropped rapidly from the sky as if a streak of silver light.Bang!A miserable sound rang out from the middle of the mountain, and dust and smoke filled the surrounding soon after. That eight or nine meter long huge pangolin was smashed on site, and many of its strong and tough bones were snapped as his body became a puddle. Even if its body was as hard as steel, it would not have survived.\u201cBig aunt, you\u2019re so strong!\u201d The little guy gasped in admiration.The Green Scaled Eagle dove down towards the mountain again. It was the outer mountain range\u2019s apex predator. Naturally, it could show disdain on the groups of beasts.Wen!\u00a0This time, without using its corporeal body\u2019s strength, it spat out a streak of azure moonlight. There were a few disparities between this attack and the little guy\u2019s silver moon. Its diameter was two meters long as it targeted straight for the twenty meter long Kui.With the activation of this ancestral precious technique, the area was suddenly thrown into chaos. Many vicious birds and fierce beasts were terrified and decided to flee in all directions. However, there were some fierce and violent ones that were extra blood-thirsty, and decided to sweep away the huge mess.Pu.That disked azure moon gloriously dazzled, and with incomparable sharpness, it directly chopped off the Kui\u2019s huge head. Blood spouted out over ten meters high, and that headless body dropped to the floor with a rumble, vibrating the surface. Blood flowed out like a small river.Meow!A sound that made people\u2019s head shiver was heard. It was that huge leopard that measured over several meters long. It hid behind a mountain boulder that was located at a higher terrain, and it fiercely leaped forth from behind with intent to kill the Green Scaled Eagle. On its head was a huge black horn, and it thrusted perfectly straight towards the back of the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s head, as it used both its huge claws measuring over half a meter to tear towards her back.This was a perfect ambush, and it was going to be successful, as the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s steel-like scales might not be able to protect itself. After all, this was a leopard that possessed the original Archaic Blood.At the same time, the sound of flapping could be heard. Seven or eight vicious birds descended from all directions. They all grabbed towards the Green Scaled Eagle since they felt it was the most threatening, and acted together to defeat the overlord of the skies.A hazy light was activated and a round\u00a0silver moon rose up. Symbols flickered, and the disked moon with the palace and ancient tree emitted a brilliant splendor. With a\u00a0ween sound, that fearsome leopard\u2019s horn was split into pieces, and its skull was cleaved into two pieces. It screamed miserably as it dropped to the floor.\u201cAuntie, don\u2019t worry. I got your back.\u201d Little Shi Hao spoke with his childish nature.The Green Scale Eagle shrieked in a loud voice and flapped both its wings. It swept away the other vicious birds and immediately, scales and feathers scattered about as blood spouted out. In just one breath, it ripped apart several large birds of prey that were at least five meters long. However, they were all killed with the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s bodily strength.This was precisely an an Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s descendant. Without using any precious techniques, its corporeal body can sweep away everything before it on the mountains.The wind whistled, and this time when the Green Scaled Eagle rushed downwards, most of the other fierce beasts all avoided it and did not want to provoke it, as its attacks were truly tyrannical.\u201cAuntie, let\u2019s dig out this mountain rocks. The Suan Ni is just under it.\u201d The little guy said.The Green Scaled Eagle landed, and with just a claw, it immediately split apart a huge boulder weighing a thousand jin. With its wings spread, it swept them flying with a\u00a0Hu\u00a0sound. It rapidly excavated since this place was still dangerous. Even something as strong as the Green Scaled Eagle did not dare to stay for too long.Rubble collapsed, and a deep hole was quickly dug out. Suddenly, a purple light flashed and a splendorous whip was shot out, directly flying towards the Green Scaled Eagle.Ding!The purple light whip shot out around the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s left wing, making sparks fly. This made the vicious bird burst out in anger as it felt pain on its metallic wings.\u201cYa, it\u2019s a purple snake!\u201d The little guy cried out in alarm.This snake was too fast, and they couldn\u2019t react to it. It employed a hit and run tactic, and it was only as thick as an adult\u2019s leg, however, it was six or seven meters long. It was much more refined than a huge beast.However, it was really strong. Purple scales glittered with light all over its body as they flowed with a brilliant splendor. It was incomparably sturdy, and using its strength, it could even bite off the metallic scales of the Green Scaled Eagle.Furthermore, the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s wounds were dripping with black blood; evidently, it was poisoned.Pu!The Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s descendant was also straightforward, and from within its mouth it spat out many small crescent moons. With a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, it ripped off that scaled flesh weighing several jin, and immediately blood started to pour out.\u201cAuntie!\u201d The little guy was shocked.No one could have thought that a terrifying snake hid within the middle of the mountains. Clearly, it was formidable as it dared to engage in combat with the Green Vicious Bird.The Green Scaled Eagle shrieked. Several symbols flickering on the wound to rapidly staunch the bleeding, stabilizing the injury. Afterwards, its pupils shot out two streaks of awe-inspiring cold gaze as it stared at that huge, violet and smooth slithering snake.Hissss\u2026.This snake was sensitive. It was extremely wise, rather than impulsive.Moonlight appeared, and light radiated out of the Green Scaled Eagle as it activated its precious technique. It rapidly aimed towards that purple vermin, and it hummed as it traversed the air, causing booms to sound.What was astonishing was that this violet snake\u2019s speed was extraordinarily quick. With a flick of its tail, it rapidly leaped over twenty meters away, avoiding the attack.The Green Scaled Eagle brandished its wings and tried to go in for the kill. It opened its beak and once again, the azure moonlight appeared, this time even more lustrous as it whirled towards the violet snake.Dang!It finally hit its mark; however, what made people even more flabbergasted was that this violet snake wasn\u2019t cut in half. Only, a large piece of its scale was destroyed, exposing strands of flowing blood.It struggled around in pain and quickly leaped, retreating over twenty meters away.ChiThe little guy took action, and a silver moon appeared on his right palm. A pure and holy disk appeared, and like the setting sun, it caused vapors to rise into the air. With a\u00a0Chi,\u00a0it flew out straight towards that shaken snake\u2019s wound.There, many scales had already peeled off. Its defense had dropped, and the shine of blood could be seen. However, just like before, it could not chop the bewildered snake in half, only cutting further in by a thumb\u2019s length. Its flesh and bones were extremely hard and solid as it resisted the attack.The Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s pupils dilated. If it did not enter the heart of the mountain, it was not likely for it to be injured. Today, it unexpected suffered this huge tragedy. Naturally, it would not spare this opponent. It continued to pursue to attack.Unexpectedly, a scarlet body shot out from the side, and it was over two meters long. Dazzling and flickering in a sanguine light, it appeared suddenly, making it impossible to defend against as Its body dropped onto the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s back.This was a blood sable that was over two meters long. Its entire body seemed as if it was made out of sparkling red agate, and it also had a pair of scarlet wings. Despite its body size appearing minuscule next to the huge beast, it was still especially formidable.It had extraordinary strength and was as fast as lightning. It rushed by in a flash and almost tore the little guy\u2019s chest right open as it scraped against his abdomen. It immediately followed with a claw to inflict a half meter long wound on the back of the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s neck.The little guy lightly chanted and a silver moon appeared, startling the blood sable, making it retreat.The vicious bird trembled. Its entire body radiated light, and it was completely angered. It had suffered tragedy after tragedy, causing all of its anger to be curled up as started to murderously chase after the other two strange beasts.The violet snake and the blood sable\u2019s teamwork was impeccable, as if practiced. This caused the little guy to be surprised. These creatures were actually so wise.Hong!A silver alligator rushed out from the middle of the river and arrived here, simultaneously smashing a piece of mountain rock.At the same time, seven or eight tyrannical creatures appeared, far surpassing normal huge beasts. They were all frightful opponents.Finally, as if they all came to a tacit understanding, they stopped their attacks and rapidly excavated the mountain rocks with the intention of seeing the Suan Ni\u2019s carcass before determining the victor.The Green Scaled Eagle also halted its attacks. Its body covered with huge traces of blood, and its Green Scales flickered in a cold like, seemingly very terrifying.\u201cAunt Green, are you okay?\u201d The little guy had begun to worry, there were hundreds of huge beasts. There were even a few that were stronger than the Green Scaled Eagle. The difficulty in obtaining the Suan Ni\u2019s corpse was simply too high.Boom!The silver alligator went crazy and successively tore apart the huge rocks. Suddenly, a beam of brilliant golden multicolored light blossomed, and as if a small sun was rising, it caused the mountain rocks to sparkle.Those leg was as thick as pillars, strong and robust. Densely clothed in dazzling gold fur, it looked like it was made out of gold. It was glistening and dazzling, and its terrible aura reached the heavens.The treasured body of the Archaic Descendant, Suan Ni was discovered. On its body, there were ancestral symbols flashing. This caused all the tyrannical living creatures to shake. Their eyes were red-hot, and all of them wanted to rush forward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was splendid and dazzling, thick and strong like that of a mythological beast. Even after death, it still had a dreadful influence. There were gold rays of light flowing out, making people\u2019s hearts revere.At this moment, not to mention the hundreds of vicious beasts, even the hundreds of vicious birds, silver alligator, blood sable, and violet snake couldn\u2019t help but take a step back as if affected by that terrifying aura.Finally, it was the Green Scaled Eagle that advanced first, followed by a few other beasts. There was a seemingly strong fire unicorn as well as something similar to a Hou. They were all overlords of the outer mountains; however, apart from the Green Scaled Eagle, the others were not from this area.With a rumbling sound, the Green Scaled Eagle extended its wings, shaking many mountain rocks as well as sending rocks and sand flying. This exposed a large chunk of the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body.The few other vicious beasts acted similarly as well. They grouped together, immediately causing rubble to fly into the air, shocking the other vicious beasts into retreating.A piece of brilliant and godly gold splendor trickled out. What appeared was a huge monster, and its appearance was that of a godly lion. On its head was a huge golden dragon horn, and golden scales covered its forehead. Its whole body was lustrous, shining brightly with golden silky fur.This was a Suan Ni, a genuine Archaic Descendant. Despite that fact that its noble blood wasn\u2019t the purest and not as heaven opposing as its Archaic Ancestors, it was still the most respected within the depths of the mountains.Its remaining carcass was not considered the largest, and was only six meters wide. However, a huge beast\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t determined by the size of its body, and the Suan Ni in front of their eyes was the proof of this.Its entire body seemed to be cast in gold. Despite being dead, its might was still present. A dense and vicious aura filled the air, reflecting a golden radiance, brightened the entire region of the mountain.The old Suan Ni, a strong and terrifying creature.Hou\u2026The Green Scaled Eagle, Leopard Hou, Fire Cloud Unicorn and several other birds and beasts of the same level immediately took action. Since the precious body of the Suan Ni was confirmed, now everybody was fighting over it with all their strength.QiangThat Leopard Hou let out a long hiss, and from its back shot out a streak of lightning-like silvery light; its body unexpected held ancestral symbols.PuA huge beast let out a scream. That light was incomparably sharp, and it penetrated through its chest. The front and the back was shining, exposing that broken, bleeding heart.The Green Scaled Eagle took flight a long time ago, and it started diving to execute its crazed attacks. Green moonlight spread out like light rays, sweeping across the mountain forest. A huge beast was hacked in half on the spot.It attacked without any mercy, targeting the strongest enemies with its attacks. The other several hundred huge beasts and birds of prey were not a big problem, as their numbers could not threaten it.The area immediately reeked of blood. Some huge beasts already began to recklessly charge forward and tear at that Suan Ni with the intention of eating its precious flesh and blood.Several huge beast overlords violently roared, including the Green Scaled Eagle. They executed their attacks to inhibit others, creating a huge array of chaos everywhere they went.Zhi\u2026Suddenly, a sharp whistle sounded, making people\u2019s souls feel sore. A Purple Rat, as large as a youth from the Stone Village, leaped onto the back of the Green Scaled Eagle.\u201cAunt Green Scaled Eagle, be careful.\u201d The little guy cried out in alarm.To the eyes of the Purple Rat, the Green Scaled Eagle posed the largest threat, and it wanted to eliminate it first.Its body compared to the Green Scaled Eagle was very small, but its offensive power was quite strong. With just a strike of its claw, it directly tore off over a dozen jin of flesh off of the Green Scaled Eagle\u2018s body. Unexpectedly, it was able to peel off the green scales.The little guy lightly chanted and attacked with all his might. The silver moon rotated before pursuing and attacking the purple rat.Although the Green Scaled Eagle was angry, it did not lose reason. It knew that in a far away part of the mountain, there lived a creature who was feared by hundreds of beasts, a mouse king. It consumed metal for food, and had unstoppable teeth and claws.The Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s entire body shined. Symbols interweaved, extending over its body like streaks of lightning. It confined the rat for a short duration with the goal of using ancestral symbols to wring it to pieces.Shi Hao acted as well, and used the silver moon to attack the immobile mouse king. With a loud\u00a0clunk, it was unable to break through. The little guy shockingly widened his eyes and shouted \u201cYiya, Again!\u201dQiang, qiang\u2026Sparks splashed in every direction, and that silver moon struck consecutively, causing that mouse king\u2019s fur to finally split open. Blood splashed out, but those bones were as hard as treasured artifacts and extremely hard to chop apart.The little guy did not stop there. After the first silver moon dissipated, a second one came and incessantly hacking away. Finally a\u00a0kacha\u00a0sounded, and the mouse king\u2019s bones were broken apart, causing serious damage.Hong!At the same time, the Green Scaled Eagle used the might of its interleaved symbols, causing dreadful bloody scars to appear all over the mouse king\u2019s body. Its injuries were fatal as it dropped towards the mountain rocks below.At the same time, a vicious bird overlord was also killed. Now, there were no more threats to the Green Scaled Eagle. It rapidly ascended, waiting for the mess below to clear up a bit before taking action again.In reality, not only did the Green Scaled Eagle act in this way. After attacking for a bit, the other beast overlords also decided to retreat a bit in order to not get taken advantage of, creating a stalemate.Suddenly, every scale on the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s body expanded up before rapidly contracted as if it was met with a huge fright. It fiercely descended downwards against the side of the mountain and before quickly disappearing.At this moment, the little guy felt a chill on his back, and it felt as if he fell into an ice cellar. Only after experiencing the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s rapid flight for a short while did that feeling slowly disappear.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d The little guy never palpated like he did today before. It felt like his whole body needed to stop breathing; his face turned white.The Green Scaled Eagle flew far away and then rapidly ascended above the clouds. It hid its body and watched intently at that region of the mountain.The little guy used the strength of the bone text, and both of his eyes glowed. Lying on the back of the Green Scaled Eagle, he also gazed towards that direction.Hou\u2026A whistling sound shocked the skies and vibrated the earth. The entire mountain range trembled, and leaves streamed downwards in great disorder. In this entire region, the heaven and earth started to chill. A terrifying aura flooded through, wreaking havoc.Instantly, the heated noise in the mountain calmed down. The birds and beasts all stopped their clamoring for a moment, as they were all trembling with fear, shivering all over, and didn\u2019t dare to make any sounds. Even the Blood Sable, Purple Snake and the Fire Cloud Unicorn did not dare to make any moves.A black silhouette emerged, as if an unparalleled devil king was descending. It emitted a terrifying power throughout the heavens and placed the entire mountains and ravines under a deathly stillness.This was a vicious ape. It wasn\u2019t too huge, and was only two meters tall. Its body was covered in half a foot of long black fur, shiny yet terrifying. What was even more shocking was that it actually had a pair of black corporeal wings. Not only could it walk, but it could also fly, and just like that, it descended from the sky.\u201cYa, don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s a demonic ape; moreover, its noble blood has an extremely high density. Otherwise, it would not have grown demonic wings that were capable of flight!\u201d The little guy astonishingly opened his little mouth in a circle.Demonic apes were too tyrannical. Its awe-inspiring appearance halted ten thousand beasts. Its icy gaze swept through, and not a single thing could resist. Additionally, a black fog curled up around its body, emitting a bitter aura as if it had killed a myriad of formidable creatures in the past.\u201cThis is a king from within a region within the heart of the mountains. It\u2019s not too far off from the Suan Ni.\u201dSou, the demonic ape tread forward with both feet, and leapt over a hundred meters high before diving down and landing on the skull of a massive Bear Bird.The Bear Bird was over ten meters long, and was an absolutely rare and vicious beast. With a manlike body and a pair of bird wings, it was able to rush into sky, making it quite formidable. However, right now, it was trembling with fear and did not dare to make any movements, prostrating in place.The Demonic Ape calmly sat on top of its skull and extended a claw. With a\u00a0pa\u00a0sound, it tore open that skull. With a smack of its lips and without any regard for others, it wanted to use it for food.The bear bird left out a whimper, but even if it were to die, it did not move. It was suppressed by that terrifying heaven-like overwhelming aura into completely immobility.All the vicious bird and ferocious beasts all trembled. This was an Ape King not much weaker than the Suan Ni. It walked out from within the heart of the mountains, so how could it not instill fear into the others?!PengThe Demonic Ape only ate a few mouthfuls before pushing off with its feet and soared into the sky. He landed in front of the Suan Ni, and behind it, that ten meter long vicious beast \u2014 Bear Bird collapsed.That wasn\u2019t a particularly huge black Ape King. It suddenly stomped its feet, causing rubble to fly into the sky and that rock mountain to collapse. The ground split in all directions, and the rocks in the vicinity of the Suan Ni was cleared up instantly.Moo\u2026Suddenly, the roar of a bull was heard and a blazing figured rushed in from the mountains far away. That was a huge, scarlet-colored bull. With a height of over 10 meters and a length of over thirty meters, it charged over with hooves covered in raging flames.Its entire body was doused in a fiery light. Its fur was silky, and it flickered with scarlet rays of light.\u201cCould it be that this was the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull that Grandpa Chief mention?!\u201d The little guy stared with his large eyes in disbelief.Now, Chief Shi Yunfeng was gradually growing older, but when he was younger, he once heard the elders say that within the depths of the mountains lived a flaming bull. Its godly power startled the desolate lands; unexpected, it was still alive.With a cry, the Demonic Ape spread out its wings and rushed towards the sky to confront the Flaming Devil Bull. An overwhelming heavenly aura exploded from within these two like a hurricane, flattening an entire mountain.Ao\u2026Moo\u2026Following the two huge roars, they immediately charged into each other and directly fought with their lives on the line. In an instant, earthquakes shook the mountains, ancient trees collapsed, and boulders flew.Suddenly, golden light flourished and radiance spread, causing the entire mountain to brighten. The forest and mountain rocks were all doused in a dim gold color. No one could have thought that the Suan Ni would jump suddenly with an overflowing vicious power!Hou\u2026.The surprising turn of events was like \u2018thunder in the ninth step of heaven\u2019, and it trembled the entire mountain into chaos. Like a golden flash of lightning, it pounced towards those other two King of Ten Thousand Beasts.PuIt was too fast and too sudden, making it impossible to guard against. A flash of gold light rushed through, and despite the Demonic Ape\u2019s lightning quick reflexes, it still tore off one of its arms. Fresh blood spouted over a dozen feet high.Kacha!At the same time, the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull whose flames soared into the heavens had its horn as well as some flesh torn straight off before dropping onto the floor from a strike of the Suan Ni\u2019s claws.This scene stupefied all of the vicious beasts and birds of prey. They all immediately turned soft, shuddering slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Suan Ni unexpectedly had not died. They were just fighting over its carcass, how could such a terrifying turn of events occur?!\u201cYiya, how is it alive again?\u201d The little guy scratched his head, puzzled.Hou\u2026..A world-shaking roar came through the mountain. That Demonic Ape angrily howled. Its wings got torn off while it was still alive, causing it to go mad. Fresh blood was still spilling out from its wounds.It used his remaining arm to attack, smashing the old beast shining in heavenly golden rays with its fist. The Suan Ni did not appear to be slowed by its age at all, and with a flash, it instantly reappeared over a hundred meters away.With a\u00a0Hong\u00a0sound, the Demonic Ape smashed through the other remaining half of the mountain with a godly might that shocked the desolate forest. After hitting only the air, it did not stop. With one leap, it jumped over two hundred meters high with the intention of spreading its wings and flying away.Although it was angry, it was clear-headed enough to realize it wasn\u2019t the elder Suan Ni\u2019s opponent.The Suan Ni\u2019s pair of golden eyes were extremely cold. Cloud vapors surged from its entire body like a tsunami. Moreover. it rushed forward like a golden streak of lightning, and an explosion sounded as it struck the back of the Demonic Ape.Ao Hou\u2026The Demonic ape howled loudly and its entire body shuddered. Blood blossomed 10 feet into the air, and just like before, it once again suffered a great tragedy under the effects of the Suan Ni\u2019s horrifying precious technique. A shining hole of blood appeared on the front and the back of its chest.The formidable Demonic Ape immediately dropped down. It opened up its bloody mouth, exposing snow white fangs. It charged forward with one arm, and its entire body lit up with symbols as it began activating its precious technique.On the other side, the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull\u2019s entire body was covered in a scarlet fire with a texture similar to a silky fabric. It also went mad, and its entire body was lit up with symbols as well. Its intention was not to battle the Suan Ni to death, but to take advantage of an opening to escape.However, the Suan Ni was too fearsome. It shot two light beams out from the depth of its eyes. Following that, it struck the body of the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull with a thundering sound, causing its symbols to dissipate and streaks of bloody scars to appear.Moo\u2026.The thirty meter long scarlet red devil bull became furious. The flames on its body reached the heavens, and its mythical flames were ignited. It rose up, spread open its huge mouth, and spouted out a stream of flourishing scarlet red in all directions, causing rocky peaks to become magma.With this attack, there were unfathomable numbers of vicious birds and ferocious beasts that turned to ashes on the scene. They did not even have time to scream.The Suan Ni yelled, and the golden light rays on its body intensified. Its gaudy magnificence caused the entire mountain region to become a sea of gold. A mist surged out and blocked the mythical flames.In the cloud banks far away, the little guy murmured to himself \u201cThe Suan Ni was actually feigning its death. Wanting to eliminate its enemies, it deliberately attracted the Demonic Ape and the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull to come. As expected of a wise race, it is sharper than a human.Demonic cries rang out, and mythical flames overflowed the heavens. Mist and lightning interweaved, and the area was already boiling with intensity. In this confrontation between three archaic descendants, the noise shocked the heavens and moved the earth, shaking this entire desolate land.On the Suan Ni, Mythical Flaming Devil Bull and the Ape King\u2019s bodies, mysterious patterns interweaved. They were densely packed together and light rays burning fiercely like an electric snake fluttering in the breeze. Tyrannical strength began to stir, causing the weather to become unstable as the precious techniques began to activate.Hong!Ear-splitting noises spread out one after another, as if an immortal lightning was descending onto the ninth step of heaven. Red lights rushed into the skies as clouds and mists filled the air as electricity and fire fused together. The Suan Ni, Demonic Ape and the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull all trembled. The entire mountain region ruptured as if the end of the world was near.PuThe Demonic Ape flew out horizontally from the mountain with godly golden splendor. Its entire body was bloodied, and many of its bones were broken, however, it finally broke out of the Suan Ni\u2019s mist controlled region.With a\u00a0dong\u00a0sound, it split open the earth with one step, and with a spread of its demonic wings, it transformed into a hurricane. Bringing with it a black mist that overflowed the skies, it charged towards the depths of the mountains.The Demonic Ape not only had one of its arms snapped off. Several of its internal organs were smashed, and even more of its bones were broken. It needed to immediately find a calm place to rest and heal. Otherwise, if it was found by some old enemies, its death was certain.Moo\u2026.The Mythical Flaming Devil Bull shouted out, and the oppressive roar shook the entire mountain. Its entire body was covered in blood as it escaped with great difficulty. Fiery rays of light cooked the entire sky red. It knocked over a mountain peak and treaded on lava before escaping to the mountain abyss as well.There was only a Suan Ni left at the scene. Its entire body covered in gold fur dazzled as It loudly whistled in high spirits. Like the appearance of a tornado, grass and bramble were lifted off from the Earth. Huge trees were snapped in half, and mountain rocks tumbled down, causing a huge mess.The Suan Ni swept its indifferent gaze through the surviving formidable lifeforms. With a low groan, it immediately caused them to scramble into every direction as if they just received amnesty. In a flash, they all escaped.In reality, eighty percent of the birds and beasts were already dead here. Especially after the Suan Ni, Mythical Flaming Devil Bull and the Ape King battled. The effects were widespread, causing an unexpected calamity.The mountains were quiet again. Lava began to cool, only leaving behind the smell of blood on the ground. The old Suan Ni stood alone over there with its huge godlike body enveloped in a godly splendor.It was a bit lonely. The radiance in its pupils gradually dimmed, and from his mouth spilled some blood. After this shocking sight, the radiance on its body exploded, and its body cracked as it collapsed onto the mountain floor with a rumbling sound.\u201cAh, it died again. Is it for real this time?\u201d On the back of the Green Scaled Eagle, The little guy widened his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s truly too old and already at the end of its lifespan. It\u2019s a pity that after using its ultimate technique, it still could not kill its foes.\u201dThe Green Scaled Eagle flashed rays of light from its pupils and wanted to throw itself downwards, but it was still scared that the Suan Ni was not completely dead. If it was really like that, then it was simply suicide.That region of the mountain was tranquil, and not a single thing dared to approach it. All the vicious birds and ferocious beasts were scared away by the Suan Ni and did not dare to turn back, and ran without knowing how far out they should escape.\u201cAunt Green Scaled Eagle, this time the Suan Ni should really be dead. Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d Shi Hao quietly spoke.The sound of wind whistled through and green scales flashed through the clouds.How could this wise creature not be aware? It still moved prudently and carefully, circling for a while before descending downwards.\u201cYa, it\u2019s really dead.\u201d The little guy and the Green Scaled Eagle arrived in front and poked the Suan Ni. Right now, its body had already cooled down, and its life was already definitely gone.The Green Green Scaled Eagle was incredibly roused up, and clapped his wings with great force causing sand and rubble to fly everywhere. Quickly, it came back from afar with the Demonic Ape\u2019s arm. This was also an Archaic Descendant filled with rare True Blood.Kengchi, Kengchi, The little guy carried that Mythical Flaming Devil Bull\u2019s several meter long horn over and laughed simple-mindedly. His eyes quickly took the shape of a crescent moon because this was also a priceless treasure.\u201cAuntie, let\u2019s leave quickly.\u201d The little guy reminded.The Green Scaled Eagle was especially excited and showed a different side of it than its normal fierce nature. Right now its eyes were half blind, practically drunk.\u201cAya, what happened auntie?\u201d The little guy cried out in alarm.The Green Scaled Eagle grabbed the Suan Ni\u2019s body and wanted to flap its wings and never thought that with a stumble, it almost fell onto the floor.\u201cAh! Auntie you\u2019re poisoned. You have not been completely dispelled yet. \u201cThe little guy\u2019s large eyes were filled with worry.In that fight not long ago, it was bitten by that purple snake. Although it decisively cut off a large chunk of its poisoned flesh, it could still not completely block the spreading of the poison.Also, it was attacked by the blood sable as well the fearsome mouse king who consumed metal as food. Its injuries were not light, causing its body to be much weaker; as a result, the poison spread even faster, making it hard to contain.\u201cAuntie, let\u2019s hurry up and leave. Let\u2019s go back to Stone Village and let Grandpa Chief help you cure this poison!\u201d Little Shi Hao anxiously yelled.The Green Scaled Eagle flapped its wings and attempted to fly again. This time, it finally lifted up that huge Suan Ni and took to the skies towards the direction of Stone Village.En route, it shook several times and nearly dropped down. Its body was incredibly weak and almost ran out of strength. On normal days, it could easily lift prey that were twice as heavy as this.KachaAfter flying through a rocky cliff, its steel wings collided with a huge boulder, hacking open a huge chunk of the cliff before almost dropped head first into the ground.The little guy anxiously said \u201cAuntie, if you can\u2019t do it, let\u2019s throw the Suan Ni or the mythical bull horn down here first and then look for it later.The Green Scaled Eagle was strictly against this idea right away. It told him to sit on its back and hold that several meter long scarlet horn and that Demonic Ape\u2019s arm, not wanting to leave anything behind. In addition, both its claws tightly held the Suan Ni, and trembled the entire way. It flew close to the mountain and rushed towards Stone Village.Finally, Stone Village was near. The little guy carried the scarlet horn and the Demonic Ape\u2019s arm. His heart was filled with happiness and laughed heartily.This time, it was very dangerous. They almost lost their lives several times, but they actually brought back the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body. In addition, they also brought back the extra Ape King\u2019s arm and the Mythical Flaming Bull\u2019s horn. Their harvest was truly magnificent.\u201cGrandpa Chief and uncles. You kept hiding from me your worry about my five year old baptism, but I actually knew everything. All is well now, we have three Archaic Descendants. There is definitely enough True Blood.\u201dHe was incomparably happy, and his expression was brimming with happiness. His sweet laughter was so pure. In the middle of the sunset glow, it was especially splendid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During the twilight sun, it was tranquil and auspicious.They were quickly approaching Stone Village, and this area did not many many ferocious beasts. Being a village situated in the vicinity of the mountain range, it was considered fairly peaceful.\u201cWe\u2019re finally back home.\u201d The little guy was finally relieved, and let out a long breath.PengHowever, just at this moment, the Green Scaled Eagle began to fall, causing its wings to snap off a few towering trees. It was gradually becoming exhausted, and its wounds continuously bled black blood. It could no longer continue.\u201cAuntie, just hold on a bit more, we are almost home.\u201d The little guy Shi Hao encouraged.With a huge cry, the Green Scaled Eagle had finally been exhausted. Its huge body fell down, making leaves fly everywhere in disorder. Many ancient trees were smashed apart, resulting in the destruction of many large trees.Fortunately, it glided downwards and did not drop from the sky. Otherwise, if it fell from such a high altitude, broken bones and snapped muscles would have been inevitable.With a loud rumble, the Suan Ni under the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s claws dropped to the ground first and split the huge boulders in the middle of the forest. Afterwards, the huge body of the Green Scaled Eagle descended into a field of vegetation.The little guy who carried the scarlet horn also tumbled down. Fortunately, his body was light and healthy, so he timely dropped the several meter long precious horn and did not injure his own body.\u201cAuntie, nothing bad happened, right?\u201d Shi Hao quickly got up and ran towards where the Green Scaled Eagle was.The Archaic Devil Bird Descendant\u2019s situation was terrible. From its wounds dripped blood as dark as ink, emitting a fishy smell. Its entire body was lacking strength, and getting back on its feet was difficult.The Green Scaled Eagle cried towards the sky, its voice was resounding, entering and splitting rocks. It even shook the little guy Shi Hao so much that his eardrums started hurting, so he had to quickly cover his ears. The surrounding leaves fell in a disorderly fashion.\u201cRight, auntie, if you\u2019re hurt, just use all your strength to cry out. With a few bird cries, Da Peng, Xiao Qing and the others would definitely hear it and lead the chief to rescue us since we are already quite close to Stone Village, \u201dThe little guy was talking while running towards that fiery red horn. He chopped off a piece of the flesh attached to it and delivered it to the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s beak \u201cAuntie, I heard that these rhinoceros horns have the ability to cure poison. This is a horn of an Archaic Descendant, and although it belongs to a cow, it should still have some effect.He helped feed it into the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s beak and helped closed it. Only now, did this vicious bird hold a gentle gaze towards him as if he was its own child. The Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s descendants had extremely high intelligence.\u201cAuntie, you must hold on! Grandpa chief and the others will be here soon.\u201dTime passed by slowly. The sound of beasts roaring was heard from afar. The little guy started worrying because he did not know if the people of Stone Village heard the cries of the Green Scaled Eagle.If he went back by himself first and by chance a fierce beast come, given the current condition of the Green Scaled Eagle, certain death awaited it without any chance for retaliation.\u201cEven if they did not hear it, grandpa chief will certainly dispatch people to rescue us. Auntie, please wait patiently and persevere, all will be well soon.\u201d The little guy used his youthful and tender voice to give it encouragement.Muffled beast howls seemingly neared and rustling noises came from afar. The setting sun almost disappeared and the sky darkened. This part of the forest seemed especially ghastly and terrifying.\u201cAuntie, eat some precious blood again.\u201d The little guy once again cupped his hand with a piece of the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull meat and delivered it.Suddenly, the hair on the little guy\u2019s back stood up. He quickly sidestepped. An ice cold iron arrow scraped past his throat and entered a mountain rock with the sound of a bang and a metallic sound was heard.Only at this moment did the sonic boom pass by. The speed of the iron arrow was too fast, much faster than the speed of sound. Its strength was shocking. If the little guy reacted even slightly slower, the arrow would have penetrated his throat.A streak of cold light flashed through and the second iron arrow was shot. The little guy dodged and with a\u00a0pu sound, blood splashed out. That piece of meat that he originally wanted to feed the Green Scaled Eagle was penetrated.\u201cToo wasteful, for a vicious bird that\u2019s about to die. You might as well give it to me.\u201d A rough male voice came through.\u201cIt\u2019s you guys?!\u201d The little guy was shocked and angry. After seeing the Wolf Village people, the person who shot the arrows was their hunting squad\u2019s captain. His height was a massive 2.34 meters. His muscles were sturdy and strips of tendons that looked like snakes.For four weeks, there were vaguely any signs of them. Now, over twenty of them appeared. Each of them held a stiff bow, and aimed at him with their iron arrows.The little guy was very angry. His eyes wide open and said \u201cLast time, our Stone Village let you guys go, and you guys established your blood pledge. Now you want to kill me\u2026 you\u2026.\u201d\u201cTruly a cute child, is an oath worth more than that Suan Ni\u2019s rare precious body, and more than that Archaic Descendant\u2019s precious scarlet horn?\u201d A middle-aged man from the Wolf Village sneered.HehA silver white sheen shot out in all four directions. The little guy no longer exchanged words. Both arms spread, and cut out a dazzling disked moon just like the descent of a heavenly moon from the ninth level of heaven.He held the moon and rushed towards those people. He no longer paid heed to reason and only thought of fighting. Although he was still a small child, he had often heard of the fierce beasts\u2019 cruelty and dread in this desolate land.Right now, the little guy treated these people like fierce beasts, and no longer saw them as people of the same species. He rapidly advanced with the intention of fighting them and protecting his aunt, the Green Scaled Eagle.Because in his heart, this group of people were far from as kind as the ordinarily vicious Green Scaled Eagle. He would never sympathize with them again.Whoosh Whoosh\u2026As concentrated as rain, these iron arrows flew towards him. Each shot had a thousand jin of force behind it, and they were incomparably frightening. Even huge beasts would die from a single shot.So many people simultaneously shot at such a young child. They were simply cold-blooded and ruthless. They showed no mercy, and only held a cold and cruel smile.DangThe silver moon rotated and knocked down a row of iron arrows.\u00a0Gebeng gebeng, even if they were iron poles, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the attack. They were thoroughly split in half.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate him. Even though he\u2019s still a child, he has a precious artifact on him. He is truly powerful. Cooperate and shoot him down!\u201d A sturdy and built man loudly roared.Wu\u2026The silver moon whizzed past and rotated around the forest. That man who was just shouting was directly hacked in the shoulders, dismembering his arm. Fresh blood spouted out, and with a blood-curdling scream, he fell onto the floor.\u201cSuch a powerful child, quickly retreat and throw the iron spears!\u201dWolf Village hunting squad\u2019s captain loudly shouted and scattered his men before retreating towards the back. They began to utilize even more formidable power to throw their spears, and their spears were even more fearsome than their arrows.Wuwu\u2026One spear pole after another emitted cold light as they ripped through the air. Each pole, roughly two meters long and 10 jin in weight, could easily penetrate the skin of a fire rhinoceros as they whistled straight ahead.Dang, dang\u2026The little guy used his silver moon to intercept the attacks, snapping one pole after another. Ear-splitting clanking sounded, sparks flew, and the situation was dire.\u201cKill!\u201dLittle Shi Hao\u2019s eyes immediately straightened out. Although he was kind-hearted and honest, he was not weak. If others wanted to kill him like this, he naturally had to retaliate and defend himself.WengThe silver moon shuddered, and he hurriedly advanced with all his strength. Using his precious moon to block the arrows, he ran ten meters forwards before striking with all his might. A snow white light flashed passed, and in front of him, blood-curdling screams rang out. Five or six people\u2019s arms were cut off and blood splashed high into the air.A few iron spears flew passed the little guy\u2019s body, barely scraping him and piercing his clothes. However, he simply ignored it, and with all his might, he activated a second disked silver moon. An ancient tree appeared on it, and it flickered magnificently as it sprinkled down some of its brilliance, making the moon appear even more splendid.PuThis time, the silver moon flew a huge distance of over ten meters and almost split the Wolf Village\u2019s hunting squad captain and a few other people in front of him in half. They were all seriously injured, and their captain\u2019s stomach was cut open, causing his intestines to almost spill out.\u201cGo!\u201dThe captain shouted with all his might. After giving this command, his complexion whitened and he started to sweat profusely. A group of people shouted, and they quickly gathered the injured before scattering and retreating into the forest.\u201cThis child is very odd, he\u2019s too strong. However, we already sent a letter back. The chief and the others are not too far away, they should be rushing over here quickly!\u201d\u201cAuntie Green, you\u2019re fine right?\u201d The little guy ran back. After seeing the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s injury pierced by an iron spear and a few iron arrows, he was so heartbroken that tears almost dripped out.The Green Scaled Eagle had a gentle expression. It lightly shook its head and didn\u2019t let out any sounds. It was very quiet.\u201cAuntie, I\u2019m really useless aren\u2019t I? Just then, that sort of thing happened and I still was not able to kill anyone and only wounded their shoulders and arms.\u201d The little guy wept and blamed himself.He was only a child in the end. Even though he matured early, he could not viciously massacre and spill blood like an adult. Although he attacked, his heart and hands were still trembling.However, there were those who were injured to the point of completely losing their fighting strength and could never be considered a threat again. Most of them lost their shoulders and arms, and were destined to become cripples for life.Roughly 10 li away, the Wolf Village quickly assembled. They charged towards this direction, and among them was a youth on a stretcher who was half sitting and half lying. His expression was pale and his eyes were ice-cold as he held a beast teeth bracelet in his palm.An elderly person lightly spoke \u201cHe is actually this strong, capable of wounding over ten of our clansmen. Don\u2019t fear, this time we\u2019ll use the precious artifacts granted to us by our Guardian Spirit and see how he\u2019ll create any more disturbances!\u201d\u201cThe Suan Ni\u2019s precious body is right there, and the Guardian Spirit will personally come.\u201d Another elder said.Several li away, a group people of Stone Village also moved out like fierce tigers, rushing towards the part of the mountain forest where the little guy was at. Taking the helm of this expedition were the three hatchlings, Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing. They were anxiously fluttering their wings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In this darkness, pairs of eyes watched attentively. The smell of blood wafted through the air, drawing the attention of a few fierce beasts. Fortunately, this was the outer region without too many fearsome and vicious beasts.Awooo\u2026A tiger-striped bug scuttled over, and the patterns on its body made it resemble a big silkworm dyed in a strange color. It was five to six meters long and had the head of a tiger, sinister and fierce. This big bug smelled the True Blood of an Archaic Descendent and wanted a bite of the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body.Pu!The little guy tossed out an iron spear, directly penetrating the bug\u2019s head. With a scream, blood splashed out, and the Tiger-Striped Bug rolled on the ground. Not long after, its life ended.Soundlessly, a Flying Python as thick as a water bucket pounced over from the precipice of a boulder. It spread both its wings, and a fishy smell spread through the air. When it almost neared, it opened up its huge bloodied mouth to take a bite.Qiang!Facing this violent large snake, the little guy did not dare to act carelessly. He directly activated the silver moon and whipped it like a rainbow, cutting the snake directly into two halves. Blood sprayed everywhere like rain.This all happened in just a few short moments, and Shi Hao had already killed six or seven monsters. He kept close to the Green Scaled Eagle and guarded its body. However, if this continued, vicious beasts from the heart of the mountain range would soon take notice.\u201cWolf Village\u2019s people will be here soon, don\u2019t tell me that Grandpa Chief did not hear the eagle\u2019s cries?\u201d The little guy started to worry. He could escape, but he would never leave behind the Green Scaled Eagle.Wild birds soared into the sky, and the little guy suddenly raised his head. Right now, there was a torrential downpour of iron arrows concentrated straight at his body.Murderous intent filled the air. The trees in the forest were all twisted and broken into pieces, and the densely packed blanket of iron arrows shot towards them. Even if it was a huge Dragon Horned Elephant blocking their way, it would still be shot full of holes until it turned into a sieve.The little guy exhaled and loudly shouted. From between his nose and mouth, he spouted out a stream of concentrated air. His entire body was shining, causing symbols to interweave. A silver moon like a knife blocked the front, and clanking sounds rang out.Iron arrows unceasingly fell and arrowheads continuously broke. They piled densely on the ground, emitting an astonishingly cold metallic luster.\u201cPeople of Wolf Village, don\u2019t force me!\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes reddened because a few iron arrows landed on the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s wounds.The iron arrows that were like howling winds and torrential rains finally stopped. In all directions, over a hundred people appeared. They had him surrounded from afar and stared at the Suan Ni and the precious scarlet horn, anxiously breathing.Even though they had never seen one before, if one lived in these desolate lands long enough, they would how precious the True Blood of an Archaic Descendant was. It was simply invaluable and priceless.\u201cLittle child, this Suan Ni\u2019s body is a valuable treasure. You can\u2019t guard it by yourself, so be obedient and just leave. We won\u2019t make things difficult for you.\u201d An elder said in an amiable manner.The little guy was immediately angry. They went through hell and back to be able to obtain the precious body of the Suan Ni, and soon they would have brought it back to Stone Village. To be killed off halfway by this group of people who wanted to snatch away these Archaic Descendant corpses, how could they resign themselves to such a choice?He clenched his tender white fists and said \u201cYou guys are going too far!\u201d\u201cChild, life is always like this. We are fighting in this desolate land. If we\u2019re not a bit cruel to others, then we\u2019re being cruel to ourselves.\u201d The Wolf Village elder let out a long sigh. \u201cJust hurry up and leave.\u201dThe little guy started at him without saying a single word, and waited for reinforcements to come from Stone Village.\u201cWu, truly shocking, this is actually a real Green Scaled Eagle. At first I thought this was a spotted unicorn bird. Unexpectedly, this overlord in the sky would submit itself to Stone Village, amazing!\u201d The Wolf Village elder was not just saying empty words. His amazement came from his heart \u201cPity\u2026 it\u2019s poisoned so we need to kill it.\u201dShi Hao heard what he said and held back his tears. He could also see that the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s circumstances were far from reassuring.Seeing his expressions, the Wolf Village elder squinted and said, \u201cTruly a pity, otherwise it\u2019d be a match for our Guardian Spirit. Let\u2019s just send it on its way and release it from its suffering.\u201d\u201cYou dare?!\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyebrows stood up and clenched his fist, blocking in front of the Green Scaled Eagle.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201dThe Wolf Village elder lightly laughed. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re really a good child with a kindhearted temperament that is unable to let this vicious bird go.\u201dAfter saying this, the expression in his eyes became cold. He waved his hands and said, \u201cRelease the arrows, kill this Green Scaled Eagle first!\u201dThe Wolf Village\u2019s people were startled, but they did not hesitate. Listening to the command, arrows like rain, whizzed by non-stop towards the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s wounds.The little guy\u2019s eyes were completely red and spared no effort to resist. He took out that disk-like silver moon and swept the iron arrows away in all four directions, guarding the Archaic Devil Bird Descendant.However, the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s body was too large. There were quite a few wounds that were impossible to block effectively. The little guy shuffled back and forth while moving the silver moon to block. He was so tired that sweat flowed profusely.So far, the people of Wolf Village all clearly saw that their chief, Bei Liqing was using this vicious bird to hold this child in place. Sooner or later, he\u2019ll grow weary and would decide to resort to a simpler method to kill.\u201cChief didn\u2019t you just say you wanted to let this child go?\u201d\u201cI was only scared of him running away, and wasn\u2019t serious. Only after knowing that he cares so much can we deal with him. With a potential this large, if this child grows up, what will happen then\u2026 Naturally, we have to kill him with all our might right now.The dense, iron arrows flashed with a cold light and created\u00a0whooshing\u00a0sounds as they passed by. Each one of them was extremely thick with huge force behind it. The eight or nine huge trees in front of the Green Scaled Eagle were all broken apart.The little guy was coping with his fatigue. He gritted his teeth and activated two silver disked silver moons, but it was still hard to protect the Green Scaled Eagle.Pu!The iron arrows penetrated into the wounds and brought with it a huge chunk of meat, causing great pain to the Archaic Devil Bird Descendant. Its body lightly shook\u00a0as its eyes held anger and grief. Right now, it could not budge at all; otherwise, on an ordinary day, how could these people even dare to approach it.Dang, dang\u2026The arrows were as dense as rain, and the little guy blocked with all his effort. But it still wasn\u2019t enough, and the Green Scaled Eagle had already been pierced by twenty arrows on its wounds. All of them deeply entered within its body and blood gushed out.\u201cAunt Green Scaled Eagle!\u201d The little guy was grieving. With a sobbing tone, he had tears welling up in his eyes. He was nearing his limit.Pu!An iron arrow penetrated a branch and almost tacitly penetrated the little guy\u2019s heart. He reacted extremely quickly and instantly sidestepped. However, it still struck the muscles in his little arm and blood sprayed out.\u201cAiya!\u201d \u00a0The little guy painfully screamed. This was the first time in his life that he suffered such a heavy arrow wound.Not far away, Wolf Village hunting squad\u2019s captain, Bei Shan, sneered. It was precisely his arrow that pierced the little guy\u2019s arm. His complexion was pale since not too long ago as his belly was cut open by the silver moon. He armed his bow once again and hid inside a brush to start a new round of ruthless killing. He did not care about the Green Scaled Eagle, and only aimed for the little guy\u2019s heart or throat.The little guy was hurting so much that his little face whitened. He tore off a strip of his small clothing to bind his wound. Symbols also circulated on his body to stop his wounds from bleeding even more.In these moments, the Green Scaled Eagle suffered another ten arrow shots. His wounds were almost shot rotten. The little guy was weeping because he couldn\u2019t repeatedly guard it. He shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll stake my life against you guys!\u201dHe rapidly dashed forward and activated two disked silver moons. No matter what, he needed to kill those people who were unceasingly shooting those iron arrows.Living in this huge desolate land, the Wolf Village\u2019s arrow techniques were shockingly powerful. Over a hundred people simultaneously aimed in the same direction, and all the arrows were concentrated as they flew together, making it seem as if a huge iron hammer was striking at the little guy\u2019s body. Even though he used the silver moon to block in front of him, he still spurted out blood and was blown away.\u201cShoot him dead!\u201dThe Wolf Village chief, Bei Liqing\u2019s eyes were cold and he lost his smile a long time ago. He ordered everyone to fire their arrows straight at the airborne little guy.Ya!The little guy shouted loudly. Two disked silver moons rotated around his body. Clink Clank, the sheet of arrows all snapped. The broken arrowheads all piled up, emitting their ice cold light.However, his little legs suffered another shot. Fresh blood dyed his legs red. He let out a soft and immature voice and tried to resist. He looked back at the Green Scaled Eagle on the ground and hurriedly staggered forward, rushing towards the group from the Wolf Village.The silver moons were dazzling, and like blades, the two disks shot out. Blood splashed everywhere as he frantically killed and beheaded. Seventeen or eighteen Wolf Villagers collapsed during the bloodbath, causing an alarming array of chaos.\u201cContinue to shoot that Green Scaled Eagle to death. Don\u2019t be lenient this time, nail it down!\u201d The chief of the Wolf Village, Bei Liqing commanded.Wuwu\u2026. \u00a0Ear-splitting whistles came through and a sheet of iron arrows flew towards the Green Scaled Eagle. The situation was now extremely dire.The little guy\u2019s large eyes were thoroughly red. Tears already dripped all over his little face. He felt completely powerless. If he did not go back to help, the Green Scaled Eagle would most likely die. However, if he turned around, he would walk back into the difficult situation and would tire out sooner or later and be shot dead.\u201cYou guys\u2026 are all evil people!\u201d This was the lament of an innocent child.\u201cBei Liqing, you piece of shameless dog shit. You scheme like this against a child, are you still a person?!\u201d A loud shout echoed through.At the same time, arrows as dense as locusts and flying spears like meteors all densely dropped down. Blood-curdling screams came from the direction where the Wolf Villagers were.The reinforcements from Stone Village lead by the chief Shi Yunfeng finally arrived. Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others also came and were all furious as they fired arrows with their killing intent non-stop.Chirp Chirp\u2026..Da Peng, Xiao Qing and Zi Yun fluttered their wings and quickly closed the distance. Although they could not really fly, their speed was still extremely quick. They pounced towards the Green Scaled Eagle and were all saddened.The three hatchlings all threw themselves onto a wound and used their own bodies to block the arrows. Wailing non-stop, they rubbed their heads against their mother\u2019s body, and they cried and wept as blood flowed.The iron arrows from the Wolf Village whistled over and knocked on their scales with a clanking noise. However, they were still young, and their scales were not that hard yet and bloodstains started to appear.\u201cYou sons of bitches from the Wolf Village, go to hell!\u201d Shi Linghu angrily roared.\u201cCounterattack, but do not kill those three hatchlings. Bring them back alive, those birds will one day belong to the Guardian Spirit\u201d The Wolf Village\u2019s chief\u2019s eyes shone red hot. He stared at those three hatchlings, and wanted to grab them right away.A bloody battle started and spears danced through the air as broadswords beheading one after another. Both sides charged right at each other in intense close combat.\u201cGrandpa Chief!\u201d The little guy loudly shouted.A group of adults saw that one of the little guy\u2019s arms as well as one of his legs were penetrated by an iron arrow. Fresh blood flowed, making them all feel sorry. This incited their anger and killing intent.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, child!\u201d\u201cThere is nothing wrong with me, grandpa chief quickly save aunt Green Scaled Eagle.\u201d The little guy wiped away a bunch of his tears, then loudly shouted and charged towards the people of Wolf Village. The silver moon flew about, and blood blossomed in the air. Seven or eight people let out blood-curdling screams as severed arms flew out horizontally, covering the entire area in blood.\u201cBei Liqing, you\u2019re just a lone wolf. Don\u2019t tell me you are going to break the rules in this desolate land. We don\u2019t bother each other in our survival and neighboring villages will not do battle. What do you want to do?\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng angrily shouted.Naturally, although he was saying this, he already gave his command. This time, they definitely won\u2019t be as kind and would kill them all without pardon, fighting to the end.\u201cDon\u2019t blame me, the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body and the Mythic Flaming Devil Bull\u2019s horn are all priceless treasures. Whose heart wouldn\u2019t jump out at this? Also our clan\u2019s Guardian Spirit will be making a breakthrough soon and needs large amounts of true blood.\u201cWhat, their Guardian Spirit is making a breakthrough?\u201d Shi Yunfeng was shocked and his eyes went half blind as symbols faintly appeared on one arm. He made a rapid movement, took out his jade pot and poured out his medicine to help the Green Scaled Eagle detoxify.The little guy\u2019s eyes were completely red from killing. At this time, there wasn\u2019t anyone from the Wolf Village around him. The ground was covered in severed arms, and there were roughly twenty individuals hacked apart by the silver moon.Suddenly, a sheet of splendid light rushed over from a bunch of shrubs, enveloping the little guy.\u00a0Pu pu\u00a0sound echoed through, and six or seven people from Stone Village were penetrated as fell into their own pools of blood, painfully rolling back and forth.DangAlthough the little guy used his silver moon to block, his shoulders were still scraped. A streak of terrifying blood appeared as his blood spewed everywhere.\u201cPrecious Artifact!\u201d Some people cried out in alarm.A youth with a pale complexion like a wolf kept hiding in the middle of the vegetation. He was waiting for the perfect moment to try killing the little guy. One of the light rays practically pierced his throat.It was actually Bei Feng, who was defeated by Shi Hao not long ago and had his bones broken by the people of Stone Village. That genius didn\u2019t even fully recover, yet but he was still calm as kept his gloomy and cold expression.\u201cYou\u2019re not the only ones with Precious Artifacts, I have one too.\u201d Bei Feng did not even take a glimpse at those would were rolling around in the middle of their own blood. Hearing them yelling, he appeared indifferent and cold.After that shower of light, it wrapped around his wrists and formed a beast tooth bracelet. Each tooth was a sparkling snow white, truly beautiful.He did not understand the bone text yet he knew how to use precious artifacts. How could this be? It made people astonished.\u201cElder Uncle!\u201d The little guy was getting anxious, and supported those middle-aged men who were penetrated by the specks of light. Their injuries were extremely severe; their innards were all torn apart and they could die at any moment.Chi!Bei Feng flicked his wrist and a rain of light flew out splendidly and beautifully, once again passing through the air like a meteor shower. Its killing power was extremely shocking.\u201cI detest myself for being too kind-hearted. I let you off last time. This time, I truly will not forgive you!\u201d The little guy\u2019s little face was full of determination and resolution.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The lights\u2019 godly splendor spilled out as it charged forward like meteors streaking across the blue heavens, splendid and beautiful. However, it was emitting a terrifying aura.A disk-shaped silver moon rose up, and as if it was suspended over a clear and gleaming sea, it emitted a peaceful yet auspicious feeling. Suddenly, an ear-splitting\u00a0dang\u00a0sound broke through this tranquility.Bei Feng and the little guy were currently having a showdown. One person used a precious artifact, while the other used his precious techniques. Splendid light drizzled like rain, and the clanking noises never stopped, shaking the entire mountain.There were a total of forty-two specks of light dancing around in the air. They condensed together to become a meteor shower, and were unfathomably dazzling. However, it was an incredible killing weapon nonetheless.With wu sounds, they whistled past the grass, grinding it into fine powder. The six to seven meter long boulders were punctured with holes, and were unable to stop them.The little guy had an unwavering expression. He was nearing the limit of his capabilities. He brought out another two silver moons; one to protect his body and the other to counter and charge forward with killing intent.\u00a0Clank, Clank, the specks of light violently collided.This was like a battle of the gods, bright and resplendent. It didn\u2019t matter whether it was the silver moon or the rain of light, they all sprinkled their godly splendor, illuminating the surroundings. Light, as red as sunset, scattered in every direction and streaks of auspicious vapors gushed out.After colliding a total of ten times, one of the silver moons shattered. The little guy condensed another one to maintain two at all times to block those drizzling specks of light that were fluctuating and attacking wildly from all directions.Weng!A slight tremble was heard, and those specks of light reversed their directions before flying back to reform the beast toothed bracelet on Bei Feng\u2019s wrist. Little grains of white, lustering gems dazzled beautifully in front of the people\u2019s eyes.This precious artifact really made people tremble in fear. Killing people while hardly being visible made it impossible to guard against. Looking at this exquisitely made artifact, one could not discern that this was actually an incredibly murderous weapon.\u201cYou\u2019re not using a precious artifact, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re using the strength of Bone Texts?!\u201d Bei Feng was incredibly bewildered and changed his complexion for the very first time. This little child was able grasp a hold of that type of mysterious power, and was truly terrifying.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Far away, the people of Wolf Village were all flabbergasted. Each of them stared at the little guy with shock and terror, as if they saw a freak of nature.\u201cBei Feng, kill him, we cannot let him live!\u201d Wolf Village Chief, Bei Liqing ordered.\u201cLittle guy, pay attention, that\u2019s a precious artifact bestowed to them by their sacrificial Guardian Spirit. As long as it\u2019s alive, they can use their artifact without understanding Bone Texts. Anyone given the artifact can use it immediately.\u201d Shi Yunfeng warned while speeding up the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s detoxification process; the symbols shined on his arms and palms as he applied medicine over several of its wounds.\u201cI will not let you go this time!\u201d In the span of just one day, the little guy experienced many things. His expression was compelling as he clenched his little fists and spoke with a firm and decisive tone.\u201cThis small child understood how to operate the Bone Text\u2019s mysterious power and attained such depth in understanding. Even in those larger tribes, this must be considered a genius as well.\u201d Bei Feng kept a cool head while keeping his emotion cold. He formed an indifferent smile and said, \u201cToo bad, you will not be living for long.\u201dWith a\u00a0weng\u00a0sound, that beast tooth bracelet flew and dispersed once more. They formed specks of light and charged towards the little guy.This time, the specks of light formed into a monster with the shape of a wolf and pounced forward. It opened up its brilliant, fierce, and huge mouth as it swallowed the little guy.Clank!The silver moon rotated and cut towards that vicious beast. As it whistled through the air, it emitted a divine and peaceful moonlight. The two forces collided and sparks flew in all directions.\u201cSuch a powerful precious technique, it is truly able to match up to a precious artifact, simply astonishing. This child is extremely young and unexpectedly so powerful. His capabilities could probably overwhelm those geniuses from larger clans. We can\u2019t spare him,\u201d Wolf Village\u2019s chief exclaimed with even more resolution in eliminating Shi Hao. Hatred had already been bred, and a benevolent relationship was no longer possible. Only after completely killing this child could they be at peace.Chi!Flames rushed towards the heavens, and that beast took form. The light scattered into different parts, and a sharp claw, bloody mouth, copper head, and iron back all dispersed. They were all comprised of specks of light as they moved towards the little guy.This precious artifact was made from forty-two vicious beasts. They can combine and scatter, and there were many ways to utilize it to attack, making it unblockable.Right now the little guy could activate two disk of silver moons. He was struggling with fatigue as he fought against the opponent\u2019s formidable precious artifact bestowed from their Guardian Spirits\u2019 precious bones.\u201cLet\u2019s see how you block this!\u201d Bei Feng lightly scoffed and chanted the secret incantation taught by their Guardian Spirit. The beast tooth transformed into a weapon and the claws and beast head were all extremely lifelike.Dang!The silver moon struck against the sharp claws and bloody beak, creating an intense collision. Soon after, the silver disk-like moon was suddenly smashed to pieces, resulting in a cloud of silver sheen splashed outward as light specks were blown away.Far away, Bei Feng was shocked and took a few steps back. This was because the little guy used this rare moment to charge towards him with the intention of killing him first.The rain of light combined together before rapidly flying backwards and protecting the front of Bei Feng\u2019s body. His expression was calm and undisturbed. \u201cIf you\u2019re so fast, can you be faster than a precious artifact?\u201dThe little guy did not answer and conducted his attack. Two disk-shaped silver moons rose up, and chopped towards his opponent.At this time, the forty-two beast teeth levitated, emitting resplendent rays of light as they linked up with one another before forming a piece of armor that draped over Bei Feng\u2019s body.The silver moon unceasingly chopped, but couldn\u2019t break through Bei Feng\u2019s body. Those forty-two linked beast teeth had constructed an incomparably hard and resplendent armor of light.At the same time, some of the beast teeth were even more awe-inspiring, forming daggers, arrows, and other weapons. These light-formed weapons all shot towards the little guy.Dang! Dang!The silver moon dimmed, and the little guy was knocked backwards.\u201cIn this desolate wasteland, I am considered a genius. But then you came into existence. Now, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Child, I\u2019ll send you towards heaven to end your short and sad life.\u201d Bei Feng\u2019s expression was overbearing as he advanced forwards.Relying on his precious artifact to protect his own body. He did not fear those two disked silver moons. One beast tooth after another emitted light as they formed arrows, daggers and other weapons before flying towards the little guy\u2019s body.This was the only time Bei Feng killed someone. Ever since his childhood, he was regarded as an unprecedented genius. His nature was tough and tenacious. Right now, to kill a child, he did not have a shred of guilt; instead he had a grim laughter.\u201cBreak!\u201dThe little guy lightly scoffed. He was never a person that felt discouraged. Although the precious artifact was strong, he had nothing to fear and still activated his ancestral precious technique.With a\u00a0boom, two disk shaped silver moons collided together and glaring rays of light exploded outwards. Faint devil bird cries could be heard as they echoed through the air like raging waves striking the shore, causing rubble to fly high into the clouds, shaking a person to the core.The silver moon exploded into pieces as two fuzzy silhouettes flew out and combined together. This scene was somewhat surreal as they formed into the shape of a devil bird. It spread its wings and struck the air as they charged towards Bei Feng.Bang!Like a precious hammer striking downwards, Bei Feng immediately spewed out blood. The precious artifact on his body immediately dimmed by quite a bit. The forty-two beast teeth armour dispersed and fell from his body.Bei Feng turned pale with fright, and others were shaken as well. This was was a precious artifact bestowed to them by their Guardian Spirit. To their dismay, it was broken by just a small child.At a crucial moment, the little guy made another breakthrough in his comprehension of his precious technique. Using this rare opportunity, he leaped high in the sky and aimed his little feet towards Bei Feng\u2019s face.Bang!Although his stature was small, his strength was incredibly shocking. With one leap, he jumped several meters into the air. He dropped down and heavily stepped on Bei Feng\u2019s face; this was a really terrifying action.With a light\u00a0ka\u00a0sound, Bei Feng\u2019s left cheek was deformed. His bones were broken, his distorted face was in pain and his eyes could not help but shed a few tears. He released a wolf\u2019s howl.Bang!The little guy stepped on his face with one foot, and the other towards his chest with the same astonishing force. His sternum creaked, and immediately afterwards, the sound of snapping bones spread through the air.Bei Feng before this day already had many bones broken by the people of Stone Village and had not even fully recover from it yet. At this moment, his whole body flew sideways while spouting out blood, making his condition much worse.The little guy had kicked him in the face, and trampled with his other leg on his chest. He then immediately followed and landed together with Bei Feng.Bei Feng\u2019s painful cry didn\u2019t resemble a human\u2019s because the little guy stepped on him as he fell. Half his face was flattened and the right side of his chest was completely broken; blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.All of this was too fast. No one could have thought that the little guy was so sharp. At a crucial time, activating a formidable precious technique to break apart a precious artifact bestowed by their Guardian Spirit. This strength was truly heaven-opposing.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cQuickly seize the precious artifact!\u201dWolf Village\u2019s chief, Bei Liqing and the hunting squad captain, Bei Shan both loudly yelled.The little guy brandished his hand and a silver moon rotated before bringing the beast tooth bracelet towards himself.This bracelet was truly beautiful. Forty-two beast teeth, all as lustrous as pearls, flickering with sparkling light. It was splendid and dazzling, yet it contained a powerful and bizarre strength.The little guy felt it with his hands and then immediately wore it on his wrist. After seeing this, the people of Wolf Village were all shocked and angered. This was an important clan treasure, and it was stolen just like that by the little guy.Bei Feng screamed under the strength of the little guy\u2019s feet as it was destroying half his body. After seeing this and being made angry, they all rushed forward.As a response, the little guy powerfully stamped his feet on Bei Feng\u2019s body, breaking over 50 percent of the bones in Bei Feng\u2019s body. Afterwards, the little guy did not even turn his head around and without batting another look, he used a silver moon and chopped down. The sound of liquid flowed, and a bloody light splashed out as both of Bei Feng\u2019s arms and legs were severed.\u201cAoo\u2026\u201d Bei Feng howled like a wild animal, painfully screaming and crying. This genius was completely finished. Although he was not dead right now, being alive was more painful than death.\u201cGuardian Spirit, why haven\u2019t you arrived yet? I beg you, come quickly!\u201d The Wolf Village chief\u2019s expression was completely ashen.In the middle of the mountain forest,\u00a0wuwu\u00a0sound echoed through as if a terrifying creature was approaching. The entire heaven and earth was suddenly filled with a cold killing intent.\u201cLinghu, Feijiao, are you two ready? Those f*ckers! If the Wolf Village Guardian Spirit dares to show itself, kill it!\u201d Shi Yunfeng shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The genius, Bei Feng, was already a cripple, and their treasured artifact had been stolen. This was a massive setback to the Wolf Village.\u201cIf it dares to come, we dare to kill!\u201d Shi Yunfeng was stern and grave, he was truly angry.The sky had already blackened a long time ago. The mountain forest had become cold and serene as the smell of blood lingered in everyone\u2019s noses.\u201cWuwu\u2026\u201d Everywhere, beasts were howling. A cold aura filled the air and made everyone\u2019s hair stiffen. It seemed like there were evil spirits crying and howling; it was terrifying.Bang!Seeing the Wolf Villagers rushing towards him, the little guy kicked Bei Feng into the air with one leg, making him fly straight in front of the Stone Villagers.\u201cAlthough he\u2019s now handicapped, leaving him will eventually bring another disaster. End this matter with one strike!\u201d Er Meng\u2019s father said. He was extremely vicious. Without uttering another word, he spun his great swords in his hand.\u00a0Pu!\u00a0He chopped Bei Feng\u2019s head straight off, causing his blood to spout several feet into the air.\u201cAhhh, my son!\u201d Bei Liqing shouted. He placed his hand in front of his chest, hurting so much that he coughed out a mouthful of blood. That was his grandson, and in the end, he was beheaded just like that right in front of his face.\u201cWe spared him once earlier. For things to have ended this way, you only have yourselves to blame,\u201d Shi Linghu said indifferently.Shi Feijai grabbed the bloody head with his palm and threw it over saying, \u201cBury it back home.\u201d\u201cGuardian Spirit, come faster!\u201d Bei Liqing\u2019s hair was disheveled and his face swelled up with blood and then became ashen. His expression was intimidating and no longer as easy-going as before.The people of Stone Village gathered and prepared to guard against that Guardian Spirit at a moment\u2019s notice. They feared that it would suddenly appear and start its onslaught. The people of Wolf Village retreated to the side. This time, their losses were too great, so they were on alert until the arrival of their Guardian Spirit.The dense forest was completely black, the roars of beasts repeatedly echoed through. However, there were no formidable creatures rushing towards them.The people from Stone Village surrounding the Green Scaled Eagle to protect it. Chief Shi Yunfeng tried all his methods and spread all the medicine he used on a daily basis everywhere and finally he gave a dose of the Archaic Descendant\u2019s blood extracted from that horn that was red as jade.Chi!A cold arrow shot through the air. Its accuracy was impeccable, targeting only the eyes of the Green Scaled Eagle. The cold light was astonishing, and this arrow was probably shot by a fierce person that was able to lift five or six thousand jin with his arms. It was truly terrifying. The people of Wolf Village feared that the recovery of the Green Scaled Eagle would most likely end in a disaster for them, so they started to execute any measures to disturb and kill.Dang!Shi Linghu spun the broadsword in his hand and chopped the arrow shaft in half, knocking it away.\u00a0Chi!\u00a0The iron arrow was embedded into a mountain boulder, emitting strings of sparks.Yiya!The little guy raised his eyebrows and rushed forwards. Today, the Wolf Village wanted to kill them and the Green Scaled Eagle. He bitterly hated this group of people. A silver moon swept across like a bright whip, passing straight through.Like a stellar river from the highest level of heaven, the silver-disked moon glided forward like white waves passing through the ocean, buzzing, rumbling, and shaking the entire mountain region.Pu, pu!On the other side, blood-curdling screams could be heard. Right away, four or five people staggered backwards as fresh blood sprayed outwards. Their wounds were intimidating, and soon after, another three or four arms fell off, causing the expressions of their owners to pale. They were all in such pain that they started sweating profusely.The little guy\u2019s movements were quick, leaping like a little Pi Xiu. He used his hands to smoothly stroke that crystalline, snow white beast tooth bracelet. Symbols flashed and he lightly scoffed.Xiu! Xiu!The beast tooth bracelet released splendid rays of light. Each beast tooth was adorned with beautiful and eye dazzling mysterious patterns. They separated from the beast bracelet and flew forward.A gorgeous shower of light rained down, but its murderous powers were shockingly powerful, causing people to be unable to react. Beast teeth like white gems penetrated many people\u2019s bodies.One flower of blood after another blossomed. Their bones were shattered as the people of Wolf Village wailed in fear, unable to protect themselves from the treasured artifacts\u2019 killing blows.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Guardian Spirit? You should be here by now! Why aren\u2019t you appearing yet? Come quick and rescue our clansmen!\u201d Bei Liqing shouted in fear, his heart full of dread. If this continued, everyone from the Wolf Village would be forced to hand everything over.\u201cRetreat!\u201dThat resplendent, treasured artifact was several folds stronger in the little guy\u2019s hands than it was in Bei Feng\u2019s hands, as he understood the Bone Text and how to operate it. The strength of the treasured artifact was now on a completely different level.The people of Wolf Village fell apart. Even if they hadn\u2019t heard the chief\u2019s order to retreat, they still would not have loitered around any further. They all fled for their lives, as their Guardian Spirit still hadn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201cLittle guy, do not chase!\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng was afraid of an unexpected accident.\u201cYa, this beast tooth bracelet\u2019s strength is truly formidable.\u201d Shi Hao lackadaisically scratched his head. He was surprised as well. Forty-two small beast teeth flew back and once more transformed into a bracelet of white gems wrapped around his wrist.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly leave as well, the Wolf Village\u2019s Guardian Spirit is innately doubtful. I said we would kill it, and so perhaps it restrained itself and did not show up.\u201d Shi Yunfeng muttered.The chief was merely bluffing. It had achieved a great effect, leaving the people of Stone Village speechless.Around a hundred people moved one after the other to lift up the Green Scaled Eagle, tend to the injured and carry the mortally wounded before they could quickly flee. They all grew up in this desolate wasteland. If they still had even one breath left, perhaps they could be saved. This group of people was following Shi Linghu\u2019s lead.Another group was in Shi Feijiao\u2019s squad. They were in charge of carrying and protecting the Suan Ni, the precious Scarlet Horn, and the Demonic Ape\u2019s arm. All of them were excited yet nervous at the same time. These were genuine pieces of priceless treasures.On the mountain floor where shrubs grew and ancient trees reached towards the heavens, a group of people moved quickly despite suffering many setbacks.Wuwu\u2026\u00a0A gloomy whistle sounded, rising and setting, echoing in all directions.Their distance from Stone Village was gradually lessening, so much so that they almost arrived. However, in this mountain forest surrounded by darkness, one pair of dark green eyes after another appeared like will-o\u2019-wisps.\u201cHeavens, such a large wolf!\u201dThe people of Stone Village were shocked; they were surrounded. A group of huge, dark-backed and white bellied wolves appeared. Each one was as large as a house. They opened their huge, bloodied mouths, revealing their half a foot long snow-white teeth as well as their scarlet colored tongues, making them seem incomparably sinister.There were not just one or two, but in fact over forty to fifty of them. A group of savage huge beasts surrounded them, much more threatening than the Wolf Village.\u201cDamn, the Guardian Spirit of Wolf Village is crafty as expected. It went so far as to gather up this huge group of mutated huge wolves.There were many wolves, and each were as large as a huge elephant. On normal days, even one would be considered a rare sight. This time, forty to fifty had arrived; it was simply a disaster.In the dark midst of the mountain forest, those pairs of sinister and cold dark green eyes were all as large as little bowls. Their vicious auras were extremely overbearing, unable to determine just how many fierce beasts they had hunted down in the past.Awoo\u2026\u00a0The wolves\u2019 howls echoed through like sudden claps of thunder. A huge silhouette pounced forward and blood-curdling screams sounded from the rear of the Stone Village.One villager was bleeding from losing half his body. An arm was torn off by the shoulder by the claws of a huge wolf, creating a fatal injury.Pu!At this crucial moment, Shi Linghu threw forward an iron lance, penetrating the huge wolf\u2019s skin, causing blood to drip from this injury.\u00a0This only redirected its bloodlust, allowing that villager to temporarily avoid being torn apart.A wolf as large as a huge elephant was too terrifying. If there were only a few, it was still possible to deal with them. However, forty to fifty of them came all at once. This was not something a hundred or so people could deal with.Awooo\u2026The huge wolves let out long howls. Leaves withered in the mountains and were shook off from the vibrations. Vicious auras surged like waves.Ahhhh\u2026Two more blood-curdling screams were heard from two different directions. Several huge wolves executed their attacks at the same time. With those claws as sharp as spear points, one swipe could cause trees to tumble down. Despite them being grouped tightly together, two villagers were still gutted, revealing their flowing intestines.\u201cQuickly, reform!\u201d Shi Feijiao loudly ordered.The mountain and forests were dark and gloomy. These huge wolves were ferocious and powerful. They had absolute superiority yet they still did not directly attack, relying on flanking and guerrilla warfare.This time, over 10 huge wolves simultaneously moved out and attacked the villagers from the darkness.Chi!The little guy made his move and raised his wrist. Symbols interweaved, and in front of his body, those forty-two crystalline beast teeth appeared, emitting a magnificent light.Pu! Pu!The foremost huge wolves had their skull pierced from their eyes, and fresh blood spilt out. They let of wretched screams and immediately fell to floor, tumbling.Even these huge creatures could not block the treasured artifact. They were simply target practice, and if they did not suffer fatal injuries, they were dead.\u201cYou evil wolves, back off!\u201d \u00a0The little guy shouted.He activated two disk-shaped silver moons and leapt forward. With two\u00a0pu\u00a0sounds,\u00a0he sliced \u00a0two of the stronger and larger wolves in half from in between the eyebrows all the way to their legs. Fresh blood spouted out.The remaining huge wolves all became cautious and no longer dared to rashly attack.\u201cIf we are truly at our wit\u2019s end, we should use an Ancestral Artifact and hide the other one. At a crucial moment, we can surprise attack that Guardian Spirit. If it knew about everything, it will be more on guard,\u201d Shi Yunfeng muttered.Dark green eyes stared from every direction, and the huge wolves surrounded them. One nose after another spouted out white vapor as the vicious killing intent sent chills down people\u2019s spines.\u201cYou guys are definitely going to die. It is your destiny today to be exterminated!\u201d Bei Liqing appeared once again, and his expression was gloomy and cold. His eyes were like a viper as he rode on the back of a huge, silvery-white wolf.The Wolf Villagers had returned. Many robust men climbed up onto the backs of huge wolves, each armed with bows and arrows. Their eyes were filled with hatred and coldness as they glared at the Stone Villagers.The people of Stone Village breathed in a breath of cold air. With the help of the huge wolves, the people of Wolf Village became formidable. This was not a power that a village should possess at all.\u201cOur clan\u2019s Guardian Spirit arrived. None of you can think about living!\u201d The Wolf Village\u2019s hunting squad captain, Bei Shan loudly shouted.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just an old wolf? It has been alive for so long that I bet even its teeth have begun to fall out. I\u2019m guessing it can\u2019t even walk anymore. What use does it have?\u201d Shi Yunfeng sneered with deliberate contempt.The Wolf Village\u2019s Guardian spirit was a legendary wolf. Both the Wolf Village\u2019s and Stone Village\u2019s clan names originated by using the Guardian Spirit as a pretext.Over ten huge wolves bellowed and howled. The vicious aura in this area was flourishing. They could start killing at any moment.\u201cNone of you will live!\u201d Bei Liqing coldly said.\u201cYou\u2019re not scared of breaking the rules of this desolate land and being attacked by every village?\u201d Shi Yunfeng said indifferently.\u201cAfter killing you guys and then capturing your women and children, we will just say our villages combined together. If our Guardian Spirit makes a breakthrough, no one would dare question any further.\u201d The Wolf Village hunting squad captain coldly smiled.Forty or fifty huge wolves tested the waters with their attacks and struck occasionally. Everyone in the Stone Village was defending, while the little guy was in charge of offense. Every time he attacked, he would kill eight huge wolves. Huge wolf bodies fell to the ground, and the forest became saturated with the smell of fresh blood.After a full two hours, the Guardian Spirit of the Wolf Village still did not show up. Only the huge wolves attacked while Bei Shan and others shot arrows.A few other people from Stone Village were injured. The sweeping claws of the wolves slashed open their bodies.\u201cAs expected, the wolf was paranoid, and it could not take this much. Ancestral Artifact, break out!\u201d Shi Yunfeng commanded.Stalling did not benefit them at all, and there was no way to know what that cunning Bei was devising. The earlier they returned to Stone Village, the better. There, they were under the protection of the old willow tree.\u201cChief, if we exposed our Ancestral Artifact, will that bring about a lot of trouble?\u201d Shi Feijiao asked.\u201cLet\u2019s protect our lives first, and then we\u2019ll kill everyone from Wolf Village at the scene. Since they forced our hand by being so heartless, don\u2019t blame our injustice!\u201d Shi Yunfeng coldly said, exposing a terrifying expression that he has never revealed in the past.They lifted up the Green Scaled Eagle very carefully, protecting it in the center. This was a strong power for their vengeance in the future. Perhaps it could even resist the enemy\u2019s Guardian Spirit.Everyone quickly scattered, and Shi Linghu took out a beast arm with the intention of activating it. This was precisely an Ancestral Artifact filled with an incomparably formidable strength.Suddenly, before he could even move, the distant mountains exploded like a flood. Ear-splitting beast howls never stopped and rushed towards where they were.\u201cA horde of beasts, damn it. That old wolf went to the heart of the mountain and chased a group of huge beasts here to attack. It\u2019s truly too devious!\u201d Shi Yunfeng\u2019s expression changed.Shi Linghu also shouted loudly, \u201cDamn that savage old wolf, using a flood of beasts to trample us to death. Everyone be on your guard!\u201dNot only their own side, even the people of Wolf Village changed their mood. Their Guardian Spirit was so fearsome. Even they would suffer from the terrifying stampede. Not everyone mounted on the back of a wolf; half of them were standing on the ground.\u201cQuick, get on the back of wolves,\u201d Bei Liqing ordered.However, there wasn\u2019t enough time left. Rumbling noises arrived in front of them. Even these huge wolves were not safe and they fled quickly to hide.Awoooo\u2026A howl echoed through like the cries of a mountain ghost, unspeakably terrifying. On top the flood of beasts, there was a strange creature flapping both its wings while coming towards them.It was only two meters long. Its tan skin was glossy all over. However, it looked very old, and a wolf face appeared with several wrinkles. This was a rarely seen legendary wolf; even in countless groups of wolves, it was difficult for one to be born.Its front legs were short, seemingly impossible for it to walk by itself. Usually it needed to lie on the back of a huge wolf. It\u2019s fortunate that its own blood was extremely powerful allowing it to grow a pair of wings, enabling flight.Clearly, this old wolf was terrifying. There were faint traces of ancient symbols flashing on its body; it was an extremely tyrannical vicious beast!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many towering trees were knocked over as if the mountains were met with a huge flood of darkness, pressing downwards.Messy leaves flew in the air and huge boulders tumbled downwards. The entire region\u2019s earth shook and mountains trembled; It was a terrifying scene to behold.Ahhh\u2026The people of Wolf Village were the first to suffer from this wave due to the direction they were in. In the blink of an eye, over ten people were knocked several meters into the air by huge beasts before getting trampled upon. Their bones broke and they became meat paste.Tens of huge wolves turned around and escaped immediately. The Wolf Villagers sitting upright on the back of them turned pale. The people who just died were relatives that they had known for a long time. In a blink of an eye, they became separated forever.\u201cGet ready!\u201d Shi Yunfeng loudly shouted.The huge beasts arrived as if they were a flood, charging towards Shi Yunfeng and the others, pulling huge trees up by their roots and snapping them in half. There was not much resistance against their advance.\u201cKill!\u201dShi Linghu shouted. He took out a rather dull beast bone. Symbols flashed on his left arm that bone artifact perfectly merged with his arm, creating an immense surge of light. The beast bone blended with his blood and bones, becoming one; the two were indistinguishable.A loud\u00a0hong\u00a0sound echoed throughout the area as if an Archaic Descendent resurrected. A vicious aura that shook that heavens appeared, shaking the entire region of the mountains as if an earthquake was occurring.All the huge beasts were scared stiff; their bodies trembled as if they were facing a King of Ten Thousand Beasts and did not dare to offend it. They rapidly halted and took a detour instead.Wuu\u2026\u00a0In the air, that wolf was crying out loudly like the howl of a malicious spirit. Its voice intimidated everyone. It was currently directing the huge beasts to attack and eradicate everyone from Stone Village.\u201cOpen!\u201dShi Linghu shouted loudly. The densely packed, resplendent, and mysterious patterns on his left arm flashed, before finally becoming the runes of an Ancient Beast King\u2019s ancient imprints. A gateway opened and a tremendous vicious beast appeared.\u201cRoar!\u201dAn oppressive roar shook the entire mountain region. Shi Linghu\u2019s body, all of a sudden, grew rapidly and bursted out of his clothes. He was standing in place with his three meter tall bronze colored body.He smashed his fist forward, and with a rumbling sound, a huge beast released its wretched scream in place before its body exploded. Blood and flesh flew everywhere as broken bones splashed out in all four direction. The scene reeked of fresh blood.The most important thing was that an extremely overbearing Beast King aura was covering the sky and the earth, oppressing these huge beasts in place. These beasts trembled and didn\u2019t dare to advance another step.Wuuuu\u2026The eyes of the old wolf changed its expression in mid-air. It was frightening, avaricious and even craftier. It figured out where the confidence of the Stone Village originated from. This fact made it feel boundless threat, but it definitely would not give up. The Suan Ni\u2019s precious body was too important for it; it enabled itself to be reborn!The old wolf started its attacks, but it did not charge towards Shi Linghu. It was in fact aiming directly for the other people of Stone Village. It was cunning and cruel, and its intention was to force Shi Linghu to use his precious artifact for defense and tire him out.\u201cSpiteful!\u201dShi Linghu\u2019s three meter tall body released an explosive strength. His tendons swelled, and the rays of light on his left arm flourished. He exploded towards the sky, and with a buzzing noise, a silhouette of a fierce beast appeared. It charged forward like a hurricane rising towards the heavens, causing all the surrounding vegetation to shrivel up and die.The old wolf was shocked and rapidly dodged. The symbols in its mouth flashed before condensing into a red light light and gushing out.\u00a0Hong!\u00a0It collided with that indistinct vicious beast.Shi Linghu staggered a bit and blood spilled out of his mouth. Ancestral artifacts were incredibly shocking, but he did not possess a strong knowledge of the Bone Text, making him unable to handle the power only be able to activate a part of its strength.But even so, the strength was enough to astonish anybody. Clashing with the body of the old wolf, the red light was blocked. It showed its shocked expression, and became even more intense.Right now, it was not just the Suan Ni, the precious Scarlet Horn and the other stuff that attracted it. Even this Ancestral Artifact became something it wanted to acquire. A pair of wolf eyes flickered with cold and vicious rays of light. With a howl, huge wolves from all directions appeared once again after hearing its commands and aided with its attacks.The situation had become critical. This old wolf never approached and always watched from afar. It was in the air as it conducted its cowardly killing spree.\u201cCrippled old wolf, do you have the guts to come down?\u201d Shi Linghu pointed.As a Guardian Spirit, it would usually make clans in this desolate land shiver with fear. However currently, it was holding back without a hint of anger. Its pupils still showed its cold expression and was never impatient.It was incredibly strong, able to destroy a village on a whim. Now it was being prudent, making people feel helpless.In every direction, huge wolves howled and unceasingly mounted their sneak attacks. The villagers were in extreme danger, growing wearier by the second.Hong!The old wolf made its move. Runes flashed and its little front claws flashed with a splendid reddish-gold light. Its ancestral treasured symbols condensed and charged down with a boom. Anybody could clearly see a huge claw filling the air quickly approaching.Everyone from Stone Village was frightened. This was an experience with an Ancestral Imprint that formed into a golden claw. It rushed out from its corporeal body, aiming to kill everyone\u201cYou crippled old wolf, go die!\u201d Shi Linghu shouted while nearing complete exhaustion. He urged himself to use the strength of Bone Text again. He lifted up his resonating left arm, and an Ancestral Rune flashed and another vicious beast appeared. He condensed quite a few runes to form a beast that resembled a Hou as it left the runes; its vicious might reached the heavens.\u201cRoar!\u201d An earth-shaking roar was heard. It collided with the gold colored claw. Lightning flashed and thunder rolled, illuminating the night sky. It was truly a sight to behold.The gold-colored claw was unable to descend any further. It streaked across the air, and with a snapping sound, a faraway mountain boulder snapped in half. Rumblings were heard as boulders tumbled down.Everyone was dumbstruck. This old wolf was too terrifying.Shi Linghu panted loudly as he had difficulty bearing his own weight. The Ancestral Artifact was too powerful, and he had difficulty getting up again.Wu\u2026The old wolf howled, and stirred up a group of wolves to charge forward with all their might. At the same time, those huge beasts began to move as well. Seeing Shi Linghu in a disadvantageous position, they started listening to the commands of the old wolf again.The situation was extremely critical. The lives of everyone from Stone Village were on a knife\u2019s edge; they could be cut off at any time.Now, the old wolf calmed down, confident in his estimation of Stone Village\u2019s strength. It was no longer bewildered and began to dive down unrestrained as it started to launch its attacks.Chi!The little guy made his move and activated his beast tooth bracelet. The Treasured Artifact emitted light, and every grain was as bright as a star as it rose into the heavens to penetrate the old wolf\u2019s body.This was the first time the wolf became angry. These were its own fallen teeth that were refined in every way possible. It was its own exclusive Treasured Artifact, but now it was in the hands of a child.It ferociously charged down and incited a chant to forcefully take back those crystalline snow-white beast teeth.Suddenly, the little guy\u2019s entire body dazzled. Bone Text twisted around him like cobwebs, illuminating his entire body. He quickly applied a bloodstained piece of ancient beast skin to his stomach.There, constellations flashed. The beast skin mixed together with the flesh and blood in his chest and was absorbed into his body. A terrifying aura was emitted like a hurricane engulfing the heavens and the earth.Long howls fell incessantly on everyone\u2019s ears. Many huge beasts were shocked into trembling, and many more even kneeled down.The beast skin became a part of the little guy\u2019s flesh, becoming a pattern of an ancient symbol, and his little body began to dazzle and spark like an ignited flame. A power that overflowed to the heavens filled the air, sending shock and awe into every direction.This was Stone Village\u2019s second Ancestral Artifact. It was originally used by Shi Feijiao, but the little guy\u2019s understanding of the Bone Text was as deep as the night and was secretly given to him, enabling him to become a murderous weapon.A barbaric beast roar sounded, trembling the desolate wasteland. Near the little guy\u2019s chest, runes transformed into a gateway. A terrifying vicious beast that resembled a Bi\u2019anrushed out, charging straight for the descending wolf.The old wolf was shocked. This was all too sudden; to dodge it was already impossible. It only waved its claws and a huge gold colored claw took form before pressing down once again.With a snapping sound as if the entire mountain broke down, the gold colored claw disintegrated. That vague Archaic Descendant wrapped its arms around the wolf\u2019s body, and with all of his killing intent, it released a blood-curdling screech into the heavens.The cunning and crafty old wolf\u2019s two meter long body was almost snapped right into two pieces and it had a tough time trying to escape. However, it was still struck by a claw on its back. With a snapping sound, that crippled leg was instantly twisted into a complete deformation.The little guy when using the Ancestral Artifact was on a whole different level than when Shi Linghu and Shi Feijiao used it. The strength was upgraded by a huge amount, but he was unable to activate the full might of the Ancestral Artifact.Evidently, Stone Village had a glorious past. These two Ancestral Artifacts should not be exposed; otherwise, it might incite the greed of larger clans to bring about calamities.The old wolf became furious and rushed towards the sky, spiraling high into the air. Not only was it unable to take back its own Treasured Artifact, it also suffered excruciating injuries. Considering its extreme craftiness, it had never suffered such a tragedy before. It could not tolerate this at all.It angrily howled while spiraling in midair. However, the other huge beasts and the vicious wolves did not dare to attack, and did not listen to its orders right away. They all took notice of the Ancestral Artifact in the little guy\u2019s hands.The old wolf went wild and spiraled unceasingly and occasionally dived down to attempt an attack. Its speed was quick; thus, it was difficult to predict its path and none of the attacks of the Ancestral Artifacts hit its mark.\u201cNot good, it wants to expend all of our energy and then kill us. Using the Ancestral Weapon uses too much of our strength.\u201d Shi Yunfeng furrowed his brows.The little guy blinked towards him and saw a face of happinessThis time, the vicious wolf raided again, nearly tearing apart ten people. That huge golden claw was too terrifying. Its strength was enormous. Luckily it was blocked by Shi Linghu.Even so, there were still gold colored rays of light that dropped down. It made seven or eight people roll over right away. They appeared badly mangled and were very miserable.Qiang!Suddenly, the heavily injured Green Scaled Eagle swiftly opened up its eyes. It flapped both of its wings, creating a huge violent gale and rushed towards the sky. Its half meter long beak released a glaring green light. A disked silver moon appeared and rapidly flew outwards.The old wolf could never have imagined that this half-dead bird could suddenly revive and become so fierce. It let out its ghastly cries and quickly dodged; however, it was a step too late.Pu!\u00a0Blood burst forth. One of its hind legs were smashed to pieces by the green moon. Its mangled flesh splashed across the sky.Bang!At the same time, the Green Scaled Eagle rushed forth, its incomparably sharp large claws stretched forward, and with the same eye-dazzling green light, it captured the wolf. Suddenly, its blood splashed out.The old wolf was frightened, angry, and tried to do everything in its power to struggle free. It was almost torn apart by the Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s claws, but it regained its freedom. Gold colored runes swirled around\u00a0its body with the intention of killing this vicious bird.Boom!Suddenly, it was shocked once more. Shi Linghu borrowed the strength of his Ancestral Artifact and threw the little guy into the sky. Shi Hao\u2019s expression was as bright as day. He used the beast skin\u2019s mysterious power to kill this vicious wolf.A Bi\u2019an rushed forth. Its vicious might terrified the desolate forest. Ten thousand beasts knelt down and hundred birds quaked in fear. The Heaven and Earth all quieted down.Boom!The vicious beast struck the old wolf on its body. Runes interweaved and godly splendor blossomed like two comets colliding; sending out powerful, glaring light all over the night sky.Huge pieces of blood rained downwards. The old wolf let out its mournful cries; its flesh and body were basically smashed apart. A large part of its lower body disappeared. This was an appalling scene and it did not even dare to look far behind itself.The Green Scaled Eagle swayed its body and caught the falling little guy. After swaying a bit more, it dropped straight into the middle of forest. With a\u00a0bang\u00a0sound, it smashed straight into the ground.\u201cQuickly, return to the village!\u201d Shi Yunfeng loudly shouted.This time they won by a fluke. That vicious wolf was careless and was severely injured by the Green Scaled Eagle that suddenly revived. Otherwise, everyone might have died here.They feared that after the old wolf calmed itself down, it would become furious and turn around to kill them. If that happened, everyone would be in the same danger as before. That vicious beast\u2019s strength was too terrifyingly strong.Everyone stayed close together and rushed back to Stone Village. They did not dare to stop for even half a breath\u2019s time.As far as the people of Wolf Village were concerned, their casualties were too heavy for them to continue. When the huge beasts rushed towards them, over half of them became mincemeat.Right now, it was not time for them to settle their debts. Stone Village did not care about them and rapidly made their escape to avoid further disasters.However, when Stone Village was in sight, that old wolf that had half its body cut off by the little guy chased behind them. It could not lose the chance to obtain the precious body of the Suan Ni. If it obtained it, not only could it recover its wounds, it could also make another breakthrough.\u201cDrat, an injured vicious beast is the most terrifying. It wants to fight with its life on the line!\u201d A dark shadow began to creep into the Stone Villagers\u2019 hearts.They were just one li away from the village, but it felt like there was a heavenly moat around it. The vicious wolf was blocking right in front of them, using all its power to stop their advance.\u201cGuardian Spirit, please protect your clansmen. Do not be so old-fashioned. Please leave the village and protect us.\u201d A few people prayed.A large, charred black willow tree with only one tender green branch was emitting one gentle thread of red light after another in this dark night, and a indistinct halo of light enveloped the entire village.Suddenly, that tender branch moved and transformed into a godly, green-red chain. Unexpectedly, it rushed outwards as quickly as lightning to over one li away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its fur was flowing with a bright luster. A pair of eyeballs flashed with an ominous glint and its entire body blossomed with a jewel-like splendor. However, right now it was in a horrified state.That alluring, emerald, green, and tender branch stretched closer and made it so it couldn\u2019t help but howl out. The old wolf\u2019s eyes were brimming with fear. Both its wings flapped, and thunder interweaved with lightning as it charged towards the heavens with the intention of escaping.This tyrannical vicious wolf did not have a shred of thought to resist. It only wanted to quickly leave this place. Every hair on its fur exploded upright anxiously as if it was a stray dog.The vicious wolf broke through the sky and continued further. However, when it was on the verge of disappearing into the middle of the night, the willow tree emitted a gentle light like a divine chain. It rushed toward the heavens and quickly overtook the wolf.Ao\u2026The old wolf cried out in alarm; every hair on its body stood erect. It did everything it could to flap its wings. Gold colored runes interweaved, and it rapidly reached as high as it could, but everything was futile.That gentle willow branch with brilliant lights and vibrant colors had a dense foggy light rising out of it. The green buds pierced through the vicious wolf from its front all the way to the back and a flower of blood splashed outwards.Wuwu\u2026\u00a0The old wolf struggled. Its eyes were filled with dread and fear and let out a heart tearing, lung-splitting howl to shake the entire mountain and ravine.Everyone from Stone Village there were dumbstruck. They knew that the old willow tree was very mysterious and was not exactly the same as ordinary Guardian Spirits, but they truly couldn\u2019t have known it was this shocking.This was the first time they had seen this. The formidable Guardian Spirit of the Wolf Village had its body penetrated without any ability to resist. This disparity was far greater than anyone could have imagined.Where did this willow tree come from? It made many people start questioning. Chief Shi Yunfeng\u2019s heart trembled. In his younger days, he once saw the old willow tree bathe in an ocean of thunder and lightning. It was an unexpectedly scary scene.The lush, green willow branch lightly trembled. Red light blazed, and the Wolf Village\u2019s Guardian Spirit let out its wretched howls as its body started to rapidly shrivel and disintegrate. Its fur and bones started to age rapidly and crack like rotten wood. Finally, it dropped down from the night sky.A small drop of gold-colored liquid condensed and dripped onto the tender branch to be absorbed. Green light started circulating vibrantly. The willow branch then retreated back to the village.A night wind swept past. On the tree charred black by lightning, a willow branch emitted a gentle light, enveloping the entire Stone Village in a white haze, peaceful and tranquil just like a painting.Everyone from Stone Village was stupefied and they were not able to utter a word for a long time. This was the first time that the old willow tree displayed its terrifying firepower in front of them. Even if it only had one branch, it was still able to kill the old wolf.Formerly, it was continuously emitting tranquil rays of light at night time to protect the village. It never took the initiative to attack anything outside the village, but it made an exception for today.\u201cThe old wolf died just like this?!\u201dMany of them felt as if everything was surreal. They expended so much energy to battle the vicious wolf and even fought on the brink of death. In the end, the Wolf Village\u2019s Guardian Spirit was directly penetrated by the tender green branch of a willow.From start to finish, the disparity was huge, and was much different from what they had imagined.\u201cBack to the village!\u201dThe villagers were trembling with excitement as they averted this crisis. They lifted up the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body and raised the precious scarlet horn before taking large strides towards the village.\u201cQuickly tend to the wounded!\u201d Shi Yunfeng anxiously shouted.This time, Stone Village\u2019s loss was not negligible. Many people suffered serious injuries, and a few of them even lost their limbs, destined to become a cripple for life. Some even lost their lives.Living in this middle of this desolate land was just this cruel. Every day, they battled with ferocious beasts. Injuries and death were plenty, but slaughter between humans were rarely seen.\u201cLinghu, Feijiao, you two bring the Ancestral Artifacts and go massacre those people from the Wolf Village. Don\u2019t leave a single one of them alive!\u201dShi Yunfeng was very decisive. He settled down the wound and then immediately gave this murderous command to kill those people from Wolf Village. They knew Stone Village\u2019s secret of the Ancestral Artifacts, and to avoid the information from leaking out and causing a disaster, they had to be eliminated.The little guy had an entire day\u2019s worth of adventure. He fought with other vicious beasts to obtain the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body and fought in close-quarters with the people of Wolf Village. He suffered a few arrow wounds, and afterwards had a huge fight with the vicious wolf. He was exhausted a long time ago.However, he still welcomed a fight and wanted to participate in this excursion. Shi Yunfeng hesitated slightly and finally nodded his head in agreement. A jade cannot make something out of itself. Only after experiencing a baptism of fire and blood could the little guy grow up.This was destined to be a sleepless night. Shi Linghu and Shi Feijiao carried their Ancestral Artifacts and brought their clansmen to relentlessly exterminate those men from the Wolf Village.Blood splashed, lives were taken, and the night froze. Mountains were dyed in blood, beasts grieved, and the atmosphere was somber and chill.In the cruel desolate lands, lives were as common as grass. Many healthy males died in the mouths of vicious beasts, and death rates were extremely high. However today, both their clans had a massacre.The Wolf Village this time sent out a hundred and twenty three individuals. Half of them died in the flood of beasts and the majority of survivors were severely injured. When they noticed that their Guardian Spirit died, their morale was extremely low and they almost collapsed.After that, it was simply a one-sided search and kill. Everyone from Stone Village checked the head count. They kept on chasing and killing, not leaving a single one of them behind.The vicious wolf had died. Those huge wolves threw those from the Wolf Village off and returned to the mountains. There were even some huge wolves that became hostile, and right away chewed many people from Wolf Village to death.\u201cVicious old bastard, where are you going?\u201dShi Linghu loudly shouted and armed his huge bow. An iron arrow flew outwards with a cold glint, illuminating the forest.\u00a0Pu, the arrow was embedded into Bei Liqing\u2019s back. The thick arrowhead ran through his body, and blood blossomed.\u201cHate!\u201d The chief of the Wolf Village angrily yelled.\u201cOld man, you went too far with your evil deeds. I\u2019ll end your life as soon as possible\u201d Shi Feijiao then spun his broadsword then swung in a beheading motion.\u00a0Pu, a bloodied head flew several meters outwards and landed on the floor.Bei Liqing died. All the survivors from the Wolf Village paled and trembled with fright. They all fled for their lives.Sou!A cold arrow shot out accurately towards the back of the little guy\u2019s head. If it hit the target, naturally it would pierce right through.Shi Hao heard the sound of the cold gust of wind and rapidly dodged. He then suddenly turned his body and stared towards towards that part of the forest. His pupils shot out with flaming fury and shouted \u201cYou again!\u201dIn the middle of some shrubs laid a strong man. However, he had already been exposed. His height was a towering 2.34 meters. His muscles were formidably strong. Flashing in a bronze metallic light, it was the hunting squad captain of the Wolf Village \u2014 Bei Shan.When the little guy started fighting with the people of Wolf Village, his first arrow wound was inflicted by Bei Shan. That time, he hid in the darkness and with one arrow after another, he shot through Shi Hao\u2019s arm. A lot of blood splashed out and now he attempted it again.WengShi Hao raised his hands, and the bracelet of beast teeth flew out like a string of gleaming white divine chains as it emitted its glorious splendor. With a\u00a0kacha\u00a0sound, Bei Shan\u2019s huge bow twisted into pieces.The vicious wolf had already died so this Treasured Artifact no longer had any connection with him. The little guy had perfect control over it and was doing whatever he wished. The brilliant crystalline beast teeth broke through every obstacle with its enormous power.Bei Shan armed his broadsword and rushed towards the little guy. A cold and threatening light flashed through the forest. A shocking man with arm strength of around five or six thousand jin used both his arms to revolve his broadsword to slash downwards like lightning.The little guy\u2019s fingertips flashed with symbols. The brilliant star-like beast teeth had completely tangled up the dazzling broadsword. With a kacha sound, the teeth snapped it into pieces of scrap iron. This was the power of the Treasured Artifact.Pu, pu\u2026..42 gentle crystalline beast teeth scattered outwards and transformed into a divine spear as arrows of light and other weapons collided into Bei Shan\u2019s internal organs. Blood spilt outwards and his arms, and legs were all broken instantly. The two meter tall body full of grandeur dropped to the ground, causing a rumble.The specks of light gathered together and transformed back into the brilliant, vibrant beast teeth bracelet before wrapping itself around Shi Hao\u2019s wrist\u201cLittle guy, kill him!\u201d Shi Linghu took large strides and came over and solemnly said.Shi Feijiao also carried his bloodied broadsword over and said \u201cHow can a boy living in these desolate lands not take others\u2019 lives. Although you are still young, your strength has already surpassed ours. If you never kill another person, eventually you will pay bitterly.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026.\u201d Little Shi Hao blinked and his long eyelashes trembled. His face showed a complicated expression: nervous, suffering, struggle, firm all combined into one.\u201cChild, I did not think I would truly be done in by you. Too bad my one arrow only tore through your little arm and not your throat.\u201d Bei Shan grinned and exposed a mouthful of terrifying, snow-white teeth.The little Shi Hao shut his eyes and thought about his uncle being shot through in the chest by an arrow. His eyes fiercely opened, and chopped down with the broadsword in his hands. PU, a head tumbled down, spraying out tons of blood.\u201cUncle Linghu, I\u2019m tired.\u201d The little guy threw away his broadsword and said wearily.He had just went through a whole day of intense combat. He continuously using his silver moon, faced enemies after enemies that grew increasingly fearsome, there were vicious beasts, ruthless people, and a vicious legendary wolf. Injured with a few arrows, he was tired out a long time ago. After saying his last words, he shut his eyes.\u201cJust sleep then.\u201d Shi Linghu carried him on his back.When Shi Hao woke up again, the night had already passed. His wounds were all treated and getting better. As far as chasing and killing everyone from the Wolf Village was concerned, that ended as well; all of them were cleanly beheaded. This time, Stone Village\u2019s iron was struck with blood. They were ruthless with their executions and did not leave a single one of them alive. Over a hundred heads were piled together and some took the initiative to fed some to beasts.Hong!Suddenly, in the heart of the desolate lands, a flaming light that overflowed into the heavens exploded out. This magnificent blaze was unparalleled. A world-shaking birdcall pierced the heavens!The flaming scarlet light was extremely magnificent and it was burning so fiercely that the sky looked like it was on fire. A little scarlet bird flew across the sky, and it divine powers were extremely shocking.A\u00a0wenglong\u00a0sounded, and in that thick layer of clouds, an earth-shattering huge golden claw stretched out and captured the little scarlet bird with is unparalleled might.ChiThe little red bird shifted horizontally and rapidly avoided it. That huge hairy golden claw crushed a mountain ridge with a single strike and rubble flew into the air, terrifying beyond belief.\u201cYa, that\u2019s the little red bird I saw before!\u201d The little guy was shocked with his eyes wide open. He saw this shocking scene immediately upon waking up.\u201cWhat happened in the end, could it be that the terrifying battle from two years ago hasn\u2019t ended? Could the tyrannical Archaic Descendent still be guarding its treasures in the mountains and they are currently fighting over it?!\u201d Shi Yunfeng was also stupefied.Hong!The gold claw descended downwards again. Its demonic powers were unmatched and it scattered blazing scarlet light everywhere. It was impossible to imagine just how large its actual body was, since just its claw was already in the clouds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed as if everything that was happening came straight out of a legend; the earth-shattering gold claw would destroy a mountain ridge each time it descended.That little scarlet sparrow was not inferior in any way and melted many mountain peaks as it passed through. Scarlet liquid erupted into the blue heavens like red rivers connecting the heavens and earth. In addition, this was only the repercussions of their battle, as the actual great battle was still taking place high up in the skies!The little scarlet sparrow was only the size of a palm, and its feathers were alluring and bright red. However, it was incomparably bold and fierce as it dove deep into the clouds to confront the terrifying unknown creature.Everyone from Stone Village was left with their mouths gaping. Cold air softened their spines as they all knew that some unfathomably formidable Archaic Descendants were near them. With just a wave of its hands, it could eliminate a super large clan. These creatures were just like gods, and after watching, the villagers could only remain speechless.\u201cToo bad we can\u2019t see it\u2026.\u201dThe thousands of clouds were incredibly thick, as if a mysterious force wanted to isolate and prevent them from seeing it. It left them wondering where in the heavens was this battle was actually occurring.\u201cSo it turns out Little Red was actually this powerful?\u201d The little guy held his little chin, blinked his eyes and murmured softly.After an hour, the heart of the mountain calmed again, but the clouds of fire did not dissipate and still hung around. The horizons were tinted in red, as if it was dyed in divine blood.\u201cWhat an eventful series of times. We still don\u2019t know what kind of treasure appeared in the mountains that was worth fighting over for two years. Could it be that there were still no results?\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng wondered.\u201cThis mountain treasure must truly defy the heavens!\u201d Shi Linghu said.\u3002There were many strange things in the most inner region of the mountain range. No one in Stone Village had gone that deep inside before, so no one knew just what kind of mountain treasure had actually appeared.During the following half month, the heart of the mountains were incredibly tranquil. There were never any battles occurring, so people gradually forgot about that hair-raising battle.However, the regions even further away certainly weren\u2019t calm at all.These were pieces of rich and fertile land filled with vast and expansive fields, beautiful mountain peaks and flowing rivers.Scaled Horses like ocean waves galloped in huge herds. Those were squadrons of armored horsemen that covered the earth in their bright and shining armor as they roamed. Their murderous spirit overflowed the heavens while practicing their drills.On the horizon, there were continuous blocks of buildings as far as the eyes could see. This area was where a huge clan with millions of people flourished.The experts in this clan were like trees, passing on their generations until now without extinguishing. Geniuses appeared from every city within the clan to guarantee they can flourish to even greater strengths.Groups of buildings were veiled with golden canopies. A scaled horse charged in and an expert jumped off of it, landing on the ground. He reported in a loud voice \u201cClan master, there are great events occurring in the south, and rumors have it that a world-shocking mountain treasure has appeared!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t it appear two years ago, how can it still be there?\u201d The sound of an elder echoed through.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, however, the most formidable creatures were still engaging brutal combat.\u201d\u201cIf you say it like that, then a holy object that shouldn\u2019t be there has probably appeared and no Archaic Descendants has obtained it yet, drawing attention from every direction!\u201d A tall and sturdy elderly man walked out from underneath that golden canopy. His eyes flashed with threads of golden lightning; he was incredibly terrifying.\u201cClan master, should we head over? Although our population haven\u2019t yet reached ten million, our strength certainly isn\u2019t below any of the others.\u201d Several experts walked over. Each of them were surrounded by an oppressing aura as if they were reincarnations of vicious beasts.\u201cHmm, don\u2019t take any risks. Bring a few young guys and take them on a walk to see the outside world. Don\u2019t take any actions without my command!\u201d The elderly man warned and shot a terrifying glance at everyone.\u201cYes!\u201dIn the distance, in another huge piece of land.A huge lake as blue as the ocean was blessed with a beautiful scenery. Islands one after another scattered like stars in the sky. The waves billowed and several children were riding a water dragon. It leaped from the surface of the water into the rolling clouds. Its scales dazzled as it rushed into the sky.On the island, in front a grand palace, A group of adults pampered them as they watched.\u201cDon\u2019t be so annoying. We\u2019ll bring you guys on a long journey later to see what an otherworldly genius looks like.\u201d\u201cChe,\u00a0all mediocre. Didn\u2019t we see an unfathomable genius last time? Weren\u2019t they still defeated by us? If he didn\u2019t escape on his Flame Unicorn into a blazing cave, then we definitely would have caught him.\u201d A youngster refuted.At another country, just as far away.This was a land ruled by its sovereign, and its borders had no boundaries. Their population reached ten million, and one huge city after another were filled with heavy traffic. People came and go, and it was flourishing with life.The majestic and imposing city walls of a huge metropolis were built by laying hard metal on top of one another. It was as if a black mountain ridge was laid across a flat land, giving people a strong and oppressive feeling.The imperial palace was quite developed, and it looked as if a heavenly temple descended onto the human world. The interior was furnished with dazzling gold and jade, and the luxuriously ornamented building showed an abundance of wealth and honor.\u201cThe Archaic Descendants fought for two years and they still never backed off?\u201d Inside the grand silver palace, a serene and dignified voice sounded from the tallest throne.His face was hidden, but his entire body was like a purple sun. His entire person was bathed in its magnificent splendor.This was his incredibly frightening life force, naturally flowing out like a huge stove. He seemed like a Deity\u00a0in this glaring purple light, making people feel as though they couldn\u2019t approach and could only hope to look from afar.In the main hall, an expert kneeled on the ground and did not dare to lift his head, kowtowing there and said \u201cYes, it\u2019s been going on for two years, it\u2019s suspected that a world-shocking divine object has appeared.In the silver throne hall, there were a few other people lined up in their seats. One of the youngsters among them stood up and said \u201cAhh, so unexpected. That piece of barbaric wilderness had this kind of opportunity awaiting there. Perhaps we could obtain it.\u201cGo find your Grand Uncle and tell him to bring you guys and those children to increase your knowledge of the outside world. However, without my command, no one can take any action. Otherwise, you will be convicted to death without any chance for pardons!\u201dA dignified voice passed down from the tallest throne. That purple sun continued to tremble, filling the air with its frightening aura and causing the entire main hall to shake.On another huge piece of land, there were many buildings constructed in a similar fashion, and its population also reached ten million. This was another place ruled by its sovereign. Inside the huge, grand palace, thunder-like rumblings sounded, shaking many armored soldiers to the floor, making them kneel.That was the sound of a person talking. It was incomparably terrifying and shook the entire palace like exploding thunders in the highest level of heaven.\u201cZishan \u00a0Hou already made his move and sent his heirs out as well. Yunkun, go and bring your younger brothers and head out as well. If you meet up with those geniuses from the Purple Mountain\u00a0family, beat them up for me.The thunder-rumbling voice echoed throughout, and inside the throne hall, several streaks of black lightning interweaved, wrapping themselves around a faint, but imposing silhouette. An ocean of thunder was forming in that direction.\u201cYes!\u201dFar away, in another valley surrounded by majestic mountains that reached the clouds. On its summit was a land adorned in silver and bound in white. Heavy snow thickly accumulated from the freezing temperature.However, a huge city was also built here. Situated in the middle of this huge mountain, it looked down upon all living things in all directions.The population here was few, but this was still a shockingly ancient clan with frightening inheritances from its ancestors. A lord ruled on this land once upon a time.\u201cA holy object actually appeared in that piece of barren and desolate forest, simply inconceivable.\u201d An elder spoke.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been continuing for two years, and the Archaic Descendants still haven\u2019t left. It\u2019s worth investigating to finally understanding what is over there; however, we can assume that there would be a lot of other people thinking the same thing.\u201cZi Shanhou and Lei Hou, these two old rivals, will certainly plan a confrontation between their heirs. Bring our young geniuses and go over to see the world.\u201cGrandfather, we all want to go.\u201d A few beautiful young maidens tread through the snow, each as beautiful as a little elf. Their eyes were sharp and their charming faces were as bright as gems. Their shiny black hair fluttered in the wind as two youth followed closely from behind.\u201cAlright, go. When the time is right, go and see how strong those other geniuses are.\u201d An elder smiled.This piece of land was quite bustling. The commotion within the depth of the desolate wasteland spread far and wide, drawing the attention of a few super large clans.Inside Stone Village, chief Shi Yunfeng was currently talking to the little guy.\u201cYour innate gifts are very good. You\u2019re so young yet your knowledge of the Bone Text is so incredibly shocking. From today onward, I\u2019ll lead you towards your next step in your transformation.\u201cIs it different from what I studied before?\u201d The little guy asked in a daze.\u201cBone Texts are born from mankind observing and imitating the ancient imprints of other species to activate mysterious patterns. This means that it is simply a trick, and the final result must come from within yourself.\u201d Shi Yunfeng said.\u201cGrandpa chief, explain it to me slowly.\u201d The little guy\u2019s desire to learn was very strong. Right now, his eyes were bright and clear.\u201cEn,\u00a0take this time to concentrate and study hard, and then I\u2019ll prepare your true blood baptism with the precious body of the Suan Ni, the precious scarlet horn and the Demonic Ape arm early. Otherwise if you leave those things out for too long, the divine powers of their true blood will depreciate. We won\u2019t wait for you to become five years old anymore. Hopefully you can bear through it!\u201dZi Shan means Purple Mountain. Lei means thunderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stolen powers, relationships spread far and wide.\u201d The chief spoke in a low voice as he looked towards the endless desolate lands while thinking about the ancient times.\u201cGrandpa chief, what does this mean, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d The little guy was very studious. His black jewel like eyes blinked, shining with a radiance of thirst.Shi Yunfeng rubbed his head and said \u201cIn the far distant past, mankind had just started their legacy. They first built a tree in the middle of everything and then spread their roots outwards.\u201dThe chief slowly explained from the start to reconcile the little guy\u2019s doubts and told him everything he knew to make him yearn for it from the bottom of his heart. This was equivalent to \u201cpath of growth\u201d.Shi Yunfeng wasn\u2019t actually too strong, but as a result of his instructive nature, he naturally said these things. Right now Shi Hao\u2019s eyes showed precisely reflected this \u201cpath of growth\u201d\u201cThe true state of society naturally spread, and everyone had their own souls. A few intelligent species, especially their representatives, were taken care of extremely well by the heavens, gifting them a reincarnated body.\u201d\u201cGrandpa chief, are you talking about those Ancient Symbols branded onto the bodies of Archaic Descendants in the form of imprints?\u201d The little guy was quick-witted.\u201cYou\u2019re so smart.\u201d The chief smiled and praised him.\u201cThe ancient natives noticed this. During their barbaric battles with beasts, they slowly began to get the hang of the rules of heaven and earth. Through the remains of powerful creatures, they gradually understood a few simple divine abilities.Consequently, the Bone Text was slowly developed like this. Mankind borrowed their powers and began to fumble around with the powers that dictated heaven and earth. Finally, from their weak state, they took small steps and eventually prospered.\u201cUnfortunately, the head seniors of the humans were still few and pitiful. The Archaic Beasts were too powerful. If one appeared, it only needed a wave of its hand to eliminate a few super large clans.\u201dRelatively speaking, mankind was still weak. Many other races were far more powerful as if they were Deities.In fact, the ancient natives had a firm conviction and often prayed and sacrificed to these divine deities.\u201cGrandpa Chief, be a little more detailed.\u201d The little guy was really thirsty for knowledge, wanting to learn more about those formidable and divine vicious beasts of the past.\u201cI only know so much, grandpa has only traveled 80000 li. Although this sounds like a lot, even the region we live in has several 80000 li at least. You need to travel at least several million Li before you reach the end of the world.Shi Yunfeng spoke softly. The places he had been to weren\u2019t few, but they were only a corner of an entire world. It was pointless to ask him about the mysteriousness of the outside end of the world, as those other huge worlds were entirely outside the realm of his comprehension.\u201cLearning a hundred thousand techniques is still inferior to walking a hundred thousand li. If you\u2019re strong enough, you should explore the outer world by yourself. Grandpa is old, so I don\u2019t have this opportunity and strength anymore.\u201d Shi Yunfeng sighed.\u201cGrandpa, I know you\u2019re suffering from internal injuries. In the future, I will promise that I\u2019ll bring you the mythical Precious Heaven and Earth Medicines to cure your illness and bring you along to see the entire world.\u201d The little guy said.Shi Yunfeng showed a bit of agony, but he was also very happy. All his wrinkles scattered and he smiled \u201cAs long as you\u2019re safe and grow up without a hitch, grandpa will be relieved of everything.\u201dIn the past, he suffered from a strange internal injury and he needed a special medicine to cure it. However, even those huge clans with population of over several million might not have it available. Everything was easier said than done.\u201cAowu, grandpa chief is lecturing again, quickly let\u2019s come and listen.\u201d A group of children clamored and shouted. Right now, they were all different from before, and the children no longer complained. They all had a greater desire for strength, and every time Shi Yunfeng would teach about the Bone Text, a group of children would all rush over to listen attentively.Now, a few children already had already shown some initial signs of symbols on their body. Without a doubt, they would be able to tread upon this path in the future. They were determined to be stronger than their parents.\u201cYou bunch of naughty monkeys, hurry up and sit down.\u201d The chief smiled.A light wind blew over. On a big, thick, and charred black willow tree, a single tender branch as sparkly as gems swung back and forth in the wind. A group of children circled around the elder\u2019s body to listen to his lectures underneath the tree.\u201cTo grasp the Bone Text is just like picking up a broadsword or arming a bow. But if you put these weapons down? Then your cultivated fundamentals still required you to have a strong body.A few children were confused and another few had flashes of sudden insight.\u201cBone Text is only a form, only a method. To truly make that power become yours is the true path. Otherwise, everything you learn is just duckweed. The only real way is to make yourself stronger.\u201cHow do we achieve this?\u201d\u201cYou need to make the Bone Text become a part of your body, and your flesh and bones must become like those creatures blessed by the heavens in order to become one with the heaven and earth. Otherwise, an imitation will only be an imitation in the end, and it will be difficult to display genuine power.The chief explained according to his ideas. The Bone Text was like your flesh and your hair. To truly make that power yours, you must make it a part of your body, and only then would it be considered true power.\u201cChief, teach us quick.\u201d\u201cBe patient, take your time.\u201d Shi Yunfeng said.In reality, using symbols takes one\u2019s own life force. When the little guy was using his precious techniques, his consumption was tremendous. Continuously using such powerful techniques would harm one\u2019s own body, weakening them overall.Strictly speaking, it is not a bad thing to learn the bone text if they don\u2019t succeed. If they do manage to learn it and they end up using it a lot during some special circumstance, it would gravely harm the body.After hearing the chief explain, the children\u2019s expressions all paled.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, just pay attention to it. As long as you\u2019re not risking your life and limb to continuously use ancient precious techniques, then you\u2019ll be fine. You guys aren\u2019t like the little guy who grasped the obscure precious techniques. Also, even if you do lose a little bit of life force, you can always recover it later.Not only the Bone Texts of Stone Village was like this, even the huge clans of the outside world were the same. To be somewhat successful, one must always be like this initially. To learn it, one must all experience this incident.\u201cThe little guy\u2019s already had a deep understanding of the Bone Text and we can learn from him about how he became like that.\u201dTo actually gain understanding, and also after attaining certain levels of understanding, one\u2019s cultivation practices have to change. The chief carried over a few bone books, and imparted to the little guy those last few symbols.After this, the chief lectured every day and taught these children. He taught each of them differently according to what their strengths were.Evidently, the little guy was a level above everyone else. Even if you put him in a huge clan in the outside world, his innate gifts would still leave people dumbstruck.These days, the little guy was intoxicated. Every day he would listen attentively and study the bone book. A smile always hung on his little face and his eyes were almost becoming the shape of crescent moons.At the beginning, one must use their own life and blood to cultivate the Bone Text to make them stronger. Only when the power truly takes shape and their understanding proceeded even more could they can reverse the flow of the power.\u201cTo become one with the symbols, to change it into a multi colored splendor and to transform it into divine light, each of them must be like an everlasting furnace within every inch of your flesh. Refining of heavenly and earthly powers, drawing divine life force into body to completely transform your flesh and soul.\u201dThis was the path that the little guy would undertake. He had already built a sturdy foundation that shocked everyone. His symbols had taken form a long time ago, and undergoing this transformation would not expend a great deal of effort from him.After only a few days, the little had some extraordinary results.After using his Precious Technique again, every inch of his blood and flesh emitted light. The symbols were vaguely visible like precious furnaces unceasingly supplying him with power.This outcome left Shi Yunfeng stupefied. He knew that the little guy had a shocking powerful innate talent, but he was surprised once again.This was but a few days, yet little Shi Hao had already succeeded in reversing the flow. If it was an ordinary person, it would have taken him several years. Even geniuses required several months.\u201cI predicted you would need two months, but after seeing this pace, you might only need one month, or perhaps even only twenty days.Little Shi Hao\u2019s performance was too stunning. A group of elders and children laughed to their heart\u2019s content. Even Shi Linghu and Shi Feijiao and the others adults also cracked a smile, revealing their snow-white teeth and laughed non-stop.\u201cMaybe he could compare to an Archaic Vicious Beast\u2019s offspring. Our Stone Village might be able to develop a person who could combat true Archaic Hou or a pure-blooded Pi Xiu.\u201cThis was a child bestowed to us by the heavens. Naturally he would be extraordinary.\u201dEveryone was extremely happy and had a scrumptious banquet to celebrate on the same day. They had all kinds of different creature\u2019s meat. The fragrance filled the air in the village, making people drool with desire.\u201cDon\u2019t be too pleased with yourselves. At the ends of the earth, there are large super clans that are powerful beyond belief. In those advanced and prosperous territories, there has to be some heaven-defying geniuses.\u201d The chief warned.Naturally, whether it was praises or warning. No one said anything in front of the children, fearing the growth of the little guy would suffer.During the next few days, Shi Hao advanced at a breakneck pace. Every inch of his flesh and blood were releasing sparkling light, becoming more and more like a god. Those symbols were transforming and recombining to thoroughly transform his entire body.Shi Yunfeng was very excited and happy. If he kept continuing like this, perhaps he would not even need twenty days; in just half a month, he might succeed. At that time, he could undertake his baptism.\u201cGrandpa chief, what path would I take in the future?\u201d\u201cThe road is very long. Right now you are in the \u201cBlood Transformation\u201d period. You are a long way off in your walk on the path of self-discovery. Genuine experts would be reborn with divine bones and develop their own ancient imprints to utilize their own exclusive Ancient Precious Technique.\u201cIt really makes people look forward to such things!\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes were bright and grasped his own little fists.Shi Yunfeng said \u201cThe ancient natives had already walked far along this road. This road is extremely long. When you are powerful enough, you could journey outside this piece of desolate land to take a look. There are things that I can\u2019t teach you that you\u2019ll have to experience for yourself in the outside world.\u201dWhen he talked about such things, chief Shi Yunfeng\u2019s expression would shift. He touched around a shining white bone on his chest, and his entire body shivered.\u201cEternally respected, the first to arrive. Stolen powers, relationships spread far and wide,\u201d the little guy chanted, and gaped into the boundless desolate land. His gaze seemed to penetrate the endless mountain ranges and view a different heaven and earth filled with unlimited possibilities.This paragraph gave us headaches to translate, so just think of it as something profound.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its population was a bit over 2000 and just over a hundred Li from Stone Village.This world was boundless. The forests were endlessly vast and flooded with vicious beasts and poisonous bugs. Human territories were situated within this ancient mountain range, and they were isolated, making contact with the outside world was difficult.Although this was a town, neither Stone Village nor Wolf Village would visit during the year. The hundred Li of mountain road were sealed off by ancient trees, and there were extremely dangerous birds of prey, poisonous bugs and vicious beasts.In fact, it was like this everywhere. This was a widespread situation. Even Stone Village and Wolf Village, being separated by just ten Li, would not meet each other for months on end.However, today, Little Lonely Mountain Town was filled with shining armor and the neighs of foreign horses. A group of armored horseman that had tread through the mountains arrived. They passed through the endless mountain range, crashed through the domains of all kinds of vicious creatures and safely arrived here.These ten mounts were all Scaled Horses. The few people in the center were riding on long unicorns. Its body was pure white and silver scales flickered on these mutated scaled horses; its divine presence was out of the ordinary.Lead by a middle-aged male with his black hair draped over. His eyes shone with a blossoming multicolored gold light and even his pupils showed traces of gold. When he gazed into the middle of the town, he shot out two terrifying beams of golden light from his eyes.Riding on the other unicorns were two young men, a young maiden, as well as a little boy and two small girls. They looked smart and intelligent, and they were all cute and adorable.People of Little Lonely Mountain Town were bewildered. Normally, very few people would come to their town. However, for the past few days, waves after waves of people came. People from over ten different huge clans all arrived, and they were all unimaginable experts.According to this trend, the amount of people would only increase. The forgotten hostels in the middle of the town were all filled up with people. Other people who could not find a place to stay and had to live in other people\u2019s households.After one group of people had just entered, another group arrived. Their prestige was even more shocking. There was a legendary flood dragon that headed the way. It was over twenty meters long, and it was covered with dazzling scales all over its body. It also had a huge pair of wings that allowed it to cross the sky. It casted a huge shadow over the ground, and a middle aged man as well as three children were sitting on it. One of them was about five or six, another eight or nine, and the last one looked to be around eleven or twelve; all of them were brilliant and promising youngsters that had extraordinary gifts.Around ten meters from the ground, the three children jumped down. The wind whistled beneath them, and after seeing this, the middle-aged man shouted \u201cSlow down, don\u2019t be too rash.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201d The youngest child shouted. His eyes were shining and beaming, and it looked as if they belonged to a Golden-Winged Peng\u2019s offspring. He descended in a spiral and with a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound,\u00a0he landed on the ground with an imposing aura.Upon seeing this, the town folks\u2019 hearts all skipped in fear. That was only a child who was five or six years old, yet he had that kind of vicious and fierce aura around him. He could jump from a height of tens of meters into the air, and could certainly tear apart a vicious huge beast with his bare hands.\u201cThis town is called Little Lonely Mountain. Could it be their Guardian Spirit it a mountain?\u201d That eleven to twelve year old child said to himself.Near the entrance of the town was a stone tablet. On the tablet, three words were inscribed: Little Lonely Mountain.\u201cYou guys look, it\u2019s actually a living mountain. It could be assumed that the townsfolk all sacrificed many vicious beast to it. Its interior could perhaps be filled with strange and rare true blood. Third uncle, kill this Guardian Spirit for us. After we get back, I want to use its True Blood to refine my body. There would certainly be great benefits!\u201d The youngest child was only five to six, but he had a incredibly imposing aura. His eyes terrified people like a vicious beast with its mouth wide open.The townsfolk hear this and all paled. To kill their Guardian Spirit was no different than destroying their town.Fortunately for them, the middle-aged man did not do as he was told and reprimanded \u201cJiao Peng, if you dare babble such nonsense again, I\u2019ll really send you back home!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t killed one before. When I bathed in a Guardian Spirit\u2019s blood years ago, it possessed a strange effect to it.\u201d The youngest child was called Jiao Peng.\u201cShut up!\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes shined with conviction like two streaks of lightning flashing across. He opened his eyes wide and said \u201cWe can\u2019t disturb Mountain type Guardian Beasts; otherwise, we could be provoking a Mountain Deity.\u201d\u201cSo boring. Can\u2019t look for treasures deep in the mountain and can\u2019t capture Guardian Spirits. Why did we come to this barren land anyway?\u201d Jiao Peng murmured.\u201cChild, you are quite spirited.\u201d A laughter echoed from far away.Outside the town in the middle of the Ancient Forest, a thick beast bone over six to seven meters long floated an inch from the ground. It was an unknown vicious creatures that emitted brilliant white rays of light, and its dense symbols flicked before rapidly charging forward while floating.There were a few silhouettes standing there lead by an old man wearing feathered clothing. He wore a golden crown and his entire body was covered with strands of purple air. He was faintly distinguishable, and it was difficult to distinguish his power.At his side, there was a young man around twenty years of age. He had a pressuring heroic spirit. There were also two young maidens around ten years old. They were as extremely beautiful, and looked as if they walked straight out of a painting. Additionally, there were also two more young boys with sharp and spirited eyes.When they came close, they strode down the beast\u2019s bone. With a flash of light, that huge six to seven meter long bone shrunk to the size of a palm. Gentle like a sparkling gem, it dropped into the hands of the elderly man.Clearly, this was extremely valuable Precious Artifact, as it was able to fly off the ground while also having the ability to shrink down to size of an inch.\u201cTurns out it\u2019s the Purple Mountain clan\u2019s heirs. Nice to meet you!\u201d The middle aged male riding the Jiao opened his mouth and said.The elderly man was Zishan Hou\u2019s uncle. He smiled and said, \u201cThe Great Floating Pool is quite fine, being able to develop this kind of youngster. He\u2019s not even six years old yet and is already this strong. After ten years, his name will certain shake the world.\u201cYou\u2019re praising him so much that his tail is almost pointing up.\u201d The Great Floating Pool\u2019s middle aged man shook his head.\u201cElder of the Purple Mountain clan, how about letting me and that your grandson have a fight?\u201d The five to six year old Jiao Peng said. He had a fierce gaze in his eyes while looking towards those two children with a provocative expression.One of the children\u2019s eyes suddenly started shining purple like a hibernating Suan Ni. His aura immediately became much stronger.Evidently, these two clan\u2019s adults did not have a harmonious relationship. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be such hostility between their children. After just seeing each other, they wanted to fight.\u201cWhat an interesting little guy. Do you really want to exchange pointers? How about this, this old man will add an incentive. I have a very rare and precious jar of a vicious beast\u2019s True Blood here. Whoever wins gets it.\u201d The elder smiled and then looked towards those middle-aged men.\u201cWu, let it be so. I have no reason to say otherwise. I have here a rare jar of a strange vicious bird\u2019s blood.\u201d The Great Floating Pool\u2019s middle-aged man said.\u201cHeh, fights, my Lei Clan likes that the most. How can you have these types of things without us?\u201d A rumbling of thunder passed through from afar.In the ancient jungle, an ancient beast\u2019s skin was flickering with symbols. It was floating three inches from the ground and was several meters long. A plain azure aura circulated around it as if it was an Archaic Descendant reborn, causing people to tremble in place.The beast skin carried several people. One of them was a young man of roughly twenty, and the others consisted of an old servant as well as several children both male and female varying from five to ten years old.There were black lightning flowing around their bodies. From a long distance away, one could already hear the rumbling noises, and it was loud enough that it violently shook the mountain earth.\u201cI will also wager the True Blood I have on me. Ming Yuan and Ya Ya, you two come over. Make Zishan Hou\u2019s two dearest children kneel before you!\u201dWith a flash of brilliant light, the beast skin became the size of a palm and landed in the young man\u2019s hands. They were already standing on the ground.\u201cAll geniuses together in a fight to determine who is the strongest. We have also fought many times in our lifetimes, so let the young ones exchange pointers as well.\u201d The townsfolk also spread rumors and started coming over.\u201cNaturally, we have to gamble. Don\u2019t bring anything other than an Archaic Descendant\u2019s True Blood.\u201d Someone spoke out. This made many people take extra-long breathes as the stakes were truly shocking.Little Lonely Mountain Town was bustling over the last few days. In the middle of the town, the indigenous people\u2019s hearts were all jumping out of their body. During these past few days, many experts had come, making them very restless.\u201cCorrect, let those children around ten or younger fight to determine who\u2019s the strongest, revealing the absolute number one genius!\u201d\u2026Little Lonely Mountain Town\u2019s weather all began to converge at this time. Over a hundred li away, Stone Village was quite peaceful and auspicious. All of the villagers were in a cheerful mood because some large event will happen soon.Little Shi Hao took barely half a month to finish his cultivation, and completely merged the Bone Text into his own flesh and blood. His entire body was shining all over and there wasn\u2019t a single speck of dirt on him; using Precious Techniques would never harm his own body again. Now, he was starting to refine it into heavenly and earthly powers, drawing divine life force into body to lighten and invigorate his body.The chief decided to use the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body, the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull horn and the Demonic Ape\u2019s arm to start his baptism, refining his body with the True Blood of Archaic Descendants and Treasured Bones.The other children would naturally not be left behind. There was such a large Suan Ni and an abundant amount of blood, so the children were all able to experience such fortune.The chief\u2019s expression was solemn and asked: \u201cChild, are you ready yet. Typically, you need to be five years old before undergoing the baptism, however, now you\u2019re doing it in advance. You are still young, and I\u2019m scared you won\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d\u201cGrandpa chief, I\u2019m not scared. I can certainly hold out until the end.\u201d\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll have those people carry the golden Suan Ni, the Demonic Ape\u2019s arm and start today!\u201d Shi Yunfeng made his serious decision.\u201cGrandpa chief. If the baptism is successful, how would my strength evolve?\u201d The little guy blinked his large eyes and asked inquisitively.\u201cThere will be a nice surprise, and you won\u2019t be inferior to those geniuses from those large clans. Even if you do end up facing off against them in the future, although you\u2019re younger, I believe that you will still display an extraordinary performance.\u201d The chief said conscientiously.Despite seeing little Shi Hao grow up, he was still shocked one time after another. The little guy\u2019s displays were extremely shocking, making people wonder whether he was an Archaic Descendant\u2019s offspring in human form.Jiao is a flood dragon, and surnames in this novel are usually related to their guardian spirits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The body of the tree is shaped like a hornless dragon, snake-like yet robust. Drenched in complete black, even its leaves were like black jade.This strange wood was solid and profound, and could be refined into any type of weapon. At the same time, it had another use. After being ignited, it would produce a vigorous and flourishing flame;\u00a0even a palm size piece of it would be able to thoroughly cook two pots full of meat. Typically, regarding the smelting of ores and weapons, this was the best type of flame.\u201cHey, chop this down for me!\u201dIn front of a vacant lot in Stone Village, Shi Linghu and a group of able-bodied men were all hammering down with their huge hatchets. This Black Dragon Wood was not something ordinary men were able to chop down.Kacha\u00a0sounds echoed through occasionally, and sometimes even a\u00a0Keng Qiang\u00a0sound could be heard as strings of sparks bursted out. The wood was truly too sturdy.For the sake of Shi Hao\u2019s baptism, the village was undergoing all kinds of preparations. Old medicines, poisonous bugs, ancient cauldrons were brought out, and even the wood used to refine the True Blood was the best Black Dragon Wood.On top of a huge piece of jade, the little guy was currently taking a bath. The villagers unceasingly rinsed his body in sweet mountain spring water to clean his body as much as possible before letting him into the cauldron.Everyone was serious, including the little guy. He did not mutter a single word the entire time and silently prepared.The Suan Ni was carried over a long time ago. Its entire body was golden as it flashed with brilliant radiance. Its golden fur was as shining like silk under the illumination of the multi colored sunset. It was extremely beautiful as it glistened and dazzled.The several meter long scarlet colored horn also laid nearby. It seemed as if it was made out of cornelian as scarlet light radiated around it. Like other Archaic Descendants, it contained the Mythic Flaming Bull\u2019s most precious True Blood.The Demonic Ape\u2019s arm was similar in length to that of an adult\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t actually too large, but it emitted an aura that overflowed into the heavens. It contained Archaic True Blood, making it very rare and precious.A black cauldron was emitting a simple odor. A sun and moon, as well as the mountains and rivers were engraved upon it. Birds, beasts, fish and bugs decorated the exterior alongside them, and the ancient natives\u2019 offering ceremony looked mysterious and enigmatic. Right now there was a lot of water in the cauldron. Under the cauldron, the Black Dragon Wood burned, and the water rapidly boiled. The water needed to be as hot as possible in order to boil the most potent precious medicine.The chief had a serene expression on his face as he stood in front of the cauldron personally, tossing in one pellet of old medicine after another. They were all treasures saved from last year. In the guarded desolate lands, medicine leaves were abundant.Not long afterwards, the boiling water released all kinds of medicinal fragrance. It was quite refreshing as the water changed colors.Soon after Shi Yunfeng took out over ten jars. Carefully and prudently, he opened them one by one. From the first jar, a\u00a0Chi\u00a0sound was heard and a big purple centipede scurried out. It was half a meter long and shocked many people.Pa,\u00a0the chief\u2019s finger flashed with some symbols and held a little purple hammer before lightly striking, knocking out the purple centipede and throwing it into the boiling water.Afterwards, the second one was a jar wrapped in thick iron sheets. After it opened, silver light radiated outwards and a pangolin rushed outwards. It was only an inch long and its entire body was shining with a dazzling silver. It was similarly knocked out in the head before being tossed into the boiling water. After a violent yet short struggle, it finally quieted down and became part of the auxiliary medicine.Over ten jars were opened. There were strange little beasts and poisonous bugs inside them. They were all special, and critters such as golden snakes as long as chopsticks and silver flying spiders were among them.This cauldron water immediately became multi-colored. All kinds of eccentric fragrances wafted out.The group of children\u2019s faces turned green at that time. This was too terrifying; all of these different types of poisonous vermins were packed so closely together, and all those old medicine were mixed in as well. No matter how you looked at it, it gave off an ominous presence.Fortunately, this cauldron was prepared for the little guy and those who needed to undergo refinement.As the water gradually boiled more and more, the water in the cauldron lessened and almost dried up in the end. Medicinal grass and all kinds of strange bugs were all boiled into a paste. This was the auxiliary medicine to ease the little guy\u2019s suffering and to help him refine the True Blood.\u201cDismember the Suan Ni and prepare to pour the True Blood into the cauldron.\u201d Shi Yunfeng shouted loudly.The Suan Ni\u2019s entire body looked as if it was molded in an awe-inspiring and brilliant golden brilliance. Although it was dead, it was still emitting an utmost powerful aura. Its fur was incomparably sturdy, and normal hatchets could not hope to chop it off. Streaks of sparks would fly and\u00a0keng qiang\u00a0sounds echoed as if they were forging iron.The good news was before the old Suan Ni died of old age, it had engaged in its final combat and wanted to destroy itself. Although it did not succeed, its entire body was already cracking and in its golden divine splendor had streaks of bloody scars.The villagers followed the split wounds and brandished their huge hatchets before chopping it open with great difficulty.Every person was incredibly shocked. Shi Linghu and Shi Feijiao both had godly arm strengths of five to six thousand jin. In this desolate forest, they were already considered one of the few stronger people. However right now, they were out of breath and drenched in sweat. They were simply following the cracked flesh, yet chopping it tired them out to such an extent.Clearly this showed how tough and durable the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body was, vastly exceeding a person\u2019s imagination.After completely splitting it open, a few elders personally took on the task of retrieving the True Blood. The True Blood contained a little bit of eye-dazzling and splendid golden liquid.This was where its treasures were hidden. This was the source of the Archaic Suan Ni\u2019s divine strength. Hidden within its blood was a tiny bit of priceless gold colored blood coveted by even the largest of clans.Although the Suan Ni was dead, its blood did not congeal and it was quite easy to deal with. They brought silverware to store the True Blood, and the floor was covered in brilliant and shining large silverware that were eventually filled to the brim.The chief decided to take action, and he brandished a jade knife filled with symbols. Hundreds of colored lights rushed outwards as he dug towards the precious heart. It was as large as a sink and faint gold all over. It contained an incomparably strong divine force, and when it was shaken, gold colored rain began to fall out.The chief did not dare to dawdle and immediately put this precious heart directly into the middle of the huge black cauldron in fear of wasting the Suan Ni\u2019s precious divine splendor. At the same time, he shouted \u201cPour in the True Blood!\u201dSeveral able-bodied men carried the huge silverware over.\u00a0Gudong, gudong\u00a0sounded as the blood was poured into the middle of the black cauldron, replacing the spring water. The precious liquid blood was the catalyst in mixing together the medicinal paste.The Black Dragon Wood beneath the cauldron was burning ever so intensely, cooking this huge cauldron until it was rumbling. That most precious heart was even more eye dazzling. Golden rain erupted and brightened up the entire cauldron. The liquid on the inside became gold in color and an especially fragrant smell wafted into the air.This was an Archaic Suan Ni. Its entire body was an extremely valuable treasure!\u201cCook it until it boils into the medicine. Little guy, prepare yourself to quickly enter the cauldron.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng said earnestly.\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Shi Hao agreed with a loud voice.The raging inferno cooked the medicine, and the intensity of the fire was ferocious. Inside the cauldron, everything became a faint gold colored liquid. From time to time, shouts from Archaic Descents could be heard, terrifying the human heart and soul.Sometimes, a golden Suan Ni faintly appeared before their eyes, terrifying even the heavens, swallowing the sun and the moon and trembling even the constellations.Everyone was dumbstruck and breathed in a large breath of cold air. Many people could not help but shudder.\u201cThis is a fragment that the original Archaic Suan Ni left behind within that diluted golden precious blood.\u201d An elder calmed down and exclaimed.This was not the end. \u00a0Villagers also pulled out a few tendons and released them into the cauldron. They extracted some faint golden marrow from its precious bones and also released it into the black cauldron, making the medicine appear even more splendid as the fragrance became even more concentrated.\u201cChief, there is a symbol on this piece of bone flowing with mysterious divine power!\u201d At this moment, Shi Feijiao cried out in fear.\u201cWhat?!\u201d The older generator of the clan all rapidly rushed over and could no longer keep a steady head.After peeling away the Suan Ni\u2019s flesh, a symbol appeared on its forehead. It was complicated yet subtle, dazzling and glistening as it constantly changed like the endless stars moving in the heavens.\u201cWow, it was actually preserved!\u201d Shi Yunfeng was shaking with excitement and then bursted out into laughter towards the sky and tears almost flowed down.The Suan Ni was self-destructing before dying, and its entire body cracked. According to the villagers\u2019 speculations, all of its primitive symbols were most likely destroyed. Archaic Descendants would think of any way possible to destroy the imprints it inherited from its ancestors to prevent it from falling into foreign hands.This was the rare treasure of a vicious primitive bone. The reason precious techniques were priceless was because of this!Truly huge clans often only had one type of strong precious technique and some weaker abilities on the side. This was the extent of their treasures.No one from Stone Village could have imagined that the fight between the Suan Ni, Mythical Flaming Devil Bull and the Demonic Ape would unexpectedly fail to destroy that piece of imprint on its precious bone.\u201cHide it well, no one can spread this information\u201d Shi Yunfeng quickly came back to reality and his face became serious and said \u201cThe heavens spared my clan, and gave us such a strong precious technique. This matter is of the utmost importance, we must protect our secret well.Afterwards, the chief turned his head and urged \u201cLittle guy, quickly enter the cauldron to start your baptism. When you come out, you can start comprehending the Suan Ni\u2019s most powerful and tyrannical precious technique!\u201d\u201cGrandpa chief, I was prepared a long time ago!\u201dAfter the bath, the little guy was sparkling all over. He looked pretty and adorable as symbols flickered on his body. He leaped right into the boiling cauldron and was immediately submerged in this brilliant and splendid golden liquid.\u201cSeal the cauldron!\u201d Shi Yunfeng shouted. The villagers brought over the huge black cauldron lid and a few people cooperated to put the lid on and sealed it tightly.The other children all felt dizzy as their faces paled. If they sealed the lid this tightly, wouldn\u2019t the water in there be so much more painful? How would they breathe?The chief looked towards them and said \u201cWhen you guys have also practiced to the point that the Bone Text has entered every inch of your body, you will no longer need to worry. You will be able to refine it into a multi-colored light, transforming it into a divine radiance. You will be able to draw the divine force of the heaven and earth to nourish your body. Entering water or fire for a long time without breathing for a long time will no longer be a problem.The multi-colored precious horn and the Demonic Ape King\u2019s arm were not boiled inside, because Shi Yunfeng was wary that the little guy might be unable to handle it. After all, the little guy was still too young and he would make a decision later based on the current circumstances.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The little guy had already been sealed inside for more than two hours. The cauldron lid would sometimes shake open, and golden liquid would splash outwards, intoxicating many people with its rich smell.A faintly visible golden Suan Ni would seemingly charge out and continuously roared like thunder. The sound was truly genuine, scaring everyone from Stone Village until their scalp turned numb.It wasn\u2019t too big, and was only an inch long. When it used its force to collide against the cauldron, its entire body\u2019s golden rays of light would dazzle the eyes. It would sometimes even charge and roar towards the little guy.The cauldron lid violently shook. All of the onlookers\u2019 hearts trembled with fear. The Villagers were tempted several times to seal the lid even more tightly, but were prevented from doing so by the Chief. Inside the cauldron was a medicine spirit, and it was the most important part of this process. It needed to be slowly refined like this, and must not be agitated.The fragrance became increasingly dense. The heavy black cauldron continuously leaked out divine splendor from cracks under the lid. The little guy inside was floating and sinking, closing his eyes to accept the baptism.Dang, dang\u2026The inch-long golden Suan Ni struggled even more intensely. Its entire body was engulfed in flames like a Deity, charging left and rushing right, colliding against the black cauldron.Everyone\u2019s expression changed, and even Shi Yunfeng became nervous. He stared with his eyes round and closely observed the medicine spirit \u2014 It was precisely the Emperor of the Archaic Suan Ni race\u2019s inherited divine fragment.\u201cLetting it continue like this won\u2019t be good. Would it break out? Chief really won\u2019t allow us to interfere?\u201d Shi Feijiao asked.Shi Yunfeng\u2019s face became serious and said \u201cThe medicine lid is already sealed. If we move it as we please, then it might cause the medicine spirit to explode, dissipating it between the heaven and the earth.\u201cYa,\u00a0not good. It\u2019s starting to attack the little guy.\u201d Er Meng cried out from within the group of children.Everyone\u2019s hearts tightened. That divine Suan Ni\u2019s radiance became even more dazzling. It bore its fangs and brandished its claws, spouting out a mist. It emitted a thundering roaring before charging straight towards the little guy.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, it died a long time ago. This is only a divine fragment without an actual consciousness.\u201d Shi Yunfeng said.The little guy\u2019s appearing was very dignified. He never moved as his flesh emitted light. He was submerged within a strange situation, isolating himself from the outside world. Refining and wrapping himself within the divine radiance, he absorbed the symbols into his own flesh, refined them into a multi-colored splendor and transforming them into divine light. Each drop of his blood was a symbol, becoming like an eternal divine furnace emitting immeasurable amounts of light to nourish himself.This time, every pore on his body expanded, and each drop of blood\u00a0had a divine property to it. Taking in and sending out the divine light, it looked as if a deity was sitting within the cauldron.His entire body overflowed with godly splendor. The specks of dense light were like innumerable Deities chanting their sutras as they emitted radiance, illuminating the heavens.That golden colored Suan Ni rushed over, and under the guidance of those specks of light, it transformed into strands of radiance. It was changed by those specks of light, and refined into Shi Hao\u2019s body.\u201cThis type of event is so mysterious!\u201d The villagers became stupefied, however, the tension in their hearts also eased up by quite a bit.Aoo\u2026.The Suan Ni struggled and resisted violently, avoiding where the little guy was and crazily rammed the side of the black cauldron, emitting waves after waves of rumbling sounds. It made the onlookers shiver, as they were afraid of this cauldron suddenly bursting open.Ultimately, the golden Suan Ni became increasingly fierce, knocking the black cauldron until it started to boom and shake endlessly. However, at this precise moment, the cauldron also began to undergo a transformation. On top of it, the sun and moon, the mountains and rivers, the birds, beasts, fish, and bugs all seemed to be resurrecting.\u201cYi,\u00a0could it be the ancient artifact passed down by our ancestors was originally a precious cauldron used to refine medicine?\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng was amazed. This behavior was similar to a large clan\u2019s cauldron.The golden Suan Ni was angry and charged even more violently. However, this cauldron became less plain and simple. It emitted a mysterious aura, and on the walls of the cauldron, symbols flashed one after another like a spontaneous reaction.All kinds of different vicious birds and ferocious beast\u2019 roars echoed through. Although they were very indistinct, they did not only appear within the villagers\u2019 imaginations. At this moment, the cauldron walls gradually began to shine and refine the golden liquid inside.The Suan Ni trembled with fright; its angry cries were extremely painful to the villagers\u2019 ears. It was originally a divine body image, but now its voice was actually resounding, scaring many people. It was preparing its final stand and everyone stood up as it they were going to vomit rays of electricity. It was almost as if it had the intention of completely shattering the cauldron walls.The big black cauldron shook, and the primitive residents carved into the cauldron became increasingly lifelike. They chanted waves of sacrificial prayers, and soon endless sutra chants could be heard as well.\u201cThis artifact passed onto us by our ancestors was apparently a genuine and rare medicinal cauldron!\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng trembled. Never had he thought that the ordinary and unremarkable black cauldron was unexpectedly this mystical.At the same time, the little guy within the golden liquid was covered in even more specks of dense light. It seemed as if a deity was becoming complete as he sat there chanting sutras that resonated within the cauldron.The Suan Ni was constantly trembling in fear before it finally disintegrated. The black cauldron refined it into streaks of divine golden beams of light, drowning the inside of the cauldron in a golden liquid.Finally, everyone calmed down. The cauldron lid joined up at the seams, tightly sealing the medicine inside and closing off everything inside from the outside world.\u201cIt\u2019s over, the cauldron is finally sealed. If nothing unusual happens, then the little guy will succeed!\u201d Shi Yunfeng said excitedly.\u201cChief, how long would this normally take?\u201d Shi Feijiao asked.\u201cNot sure, the baptism can vary quite a bit in length, from a single day to over three.\u201d \u00a0Shi Yunfeng frowned\u201cWhat?\u201d Everyone was stupefied. No wonder the chief let them chop the Black Jiao Wood and prepared so much firewood.After an entire day and night, the golden juice was boiling, but never dried up. The little guy was in there, floating and sinking with his entire body covered in a scarlet red as if he was the one dripping out the blood. The golden liquid unceasingly entered the pores of his body before seeping out with the impurities from within, repeatedly baptizing him.This was a scary process, incredibly overbearing and arduous. A normal child could not possibly handle it and would die from the pain.The golden liquid was not simply just washing, but was intruding and crazily battering the inside of his body as if it was splitting bones and mincing meat, frequently snapping tendons and muscles.The little guy gnashed his teeth tightly while remaining motionless, drawing in the golden liquid to baptize his flesh and blood. He was shining both inside and outside, and although it was incredibly painful, he felt his spirit was becoming increasingly powerful.Divine radiance tyrannically attacked him to the point of almost splitting open his internal organs. In the end, however, they were nourished before recovering with a sparkling luster. His bones were practically on the verge of collapse, but in the end they were all restored to a white and resplendent state that was stronger than they ever were before. Also, not only did his flesh obtain the effects of the baptism, the divine power also strengthened his spirit.After another day and night, the little guy experienced an unimaginable transformation.When dawn approached, he opened his eyes and yelled out \u201cGrandpa, the juice is almost dry.\u201d\u201cSuccess!\u201d Shi Yunfeng was elated and told others to uncover the lid. They saw the pores all over the little guy\u2019s body overflow with magnificence. The villagers were all shocked, and they didn\u2019t need to think and already knew that the little guy has gained tremendous benefits.Shi Yunfeng hesitated for a moment before finally clenching his teeth and saying, \u201cPrepare to release the blood of the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull\u2019s Scarlet horn and the Demonic Ape\u2019s arm!\u201dShi Linghu drew out the Archaic True Blood that was as red as the sunset from within the precious horn of the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull, and also let out the black liquid from inside the ape arm before poured them into the cauldron.Moo!In that instant, a bull\u2019s voice tightened everyone\u2019s scalps and practically made them drop straight to the floor.Hou\u2026.Immediately following that was the long howl of a demon. \u00a0A Demonic Ape suddenly appeared in the middle of the cauldron and became angry along with the scarlet Mythical Flaming Bull before striking the sides of the large cauldron.Afterwards, that golden treasure \u2014 the heart, once again leapt out a Suan Ni. Ten thousand golden rays of lights shone outwards to batter the cauldron together with them.\u201cSeal the cauldron!\u201d The chief commanded.This time, it was even more intense. Three types of True Blood blended together: the scarlet Mythical Flaming Devil Bull, the golden Suan Ni, and the black Demonic Ape. They fiercely struggled and collided with the cauldron, wanting to smash it to pieces.On the walls of the cauldron, the first natives appeared once again. Chants started up once again, and countless sutras were being repeated to suppress these three Archaic Descendants.On the inside, the little guy was also like this as countless specks of light floated within his body. His bones and organs shooked rhythmically as if it was a sonorous and divine sound. He emitted precious splendor as he resonated with the large black cauldron.Both the person and the cauldron were shining brightly, emitting all kinds of symbols and noises. Here, the clouds evaporated splendidly, flowing with kinds of different colors.This process continued for two days and two nights, before finally calming down. The cauldron lid was knocked open and the little guy jumped twenty meters, charging straight towards the sky.\u201cBurning, burning!\u201d He continuously rubbed his butt, and his entire body was pitch black, and only a pair of eyes could be seen rolling around excitedly. Everywhere else was covered in charcoal; he looked just like a Pi Hou.Everyone in the village was stupefied. Just then, the little guy rammed the heavy lid right off and rose up into sky along with it. To their surprise, he was able to leap twenty meters into the sky.The chief let out a hearty laughter; he knew that it succeeded. The little guy\u2019s actions clearly showed that, and after calming down a bit, he shouted \u201cQuickly, put out the fire under the cauldron with water. The remaining medicine is still rare and precious.The little guy descended down to ground, and a group of children surrounded him. They poked and petted while teasing him. A few people poured fresh water to help rinse him off.People had shockingly discovered that he shed a layer of his old skin. After the black skin was peeled out, a sparkling and spotless little body was exposed with light surrounding him.\u201cWow, little guy, are you a type of silkworm, how did you shed that layer of thick skin?\u201d A group of children fussed. A few little girls also joined the group. After seeing the shining and glowing\u00a0body, they showed endless admiration.The little guy was embarrassed and quickly stole some cloth and covered his body, making everyone roar with laughter.\u201cChild, let us look at what kind of transformation happened.\u201d An elder said.Shi Linhu and the other took large strides and came over and each extended their large hands and groped him all about. They were all astonished; it felt as if they were stroking a piece of warm jade.The little guy\u2019s face blushed all over. \u00a0People even played with his little thing, and the adults still treated him as though he was a newborn baby. He strongly resisted and pushed them away, almost pushing Shi Linghu right on to the floor.The group of adults burst into laughter, and the startled Shi Feijiao into saying \u201cYou guys stop laughing, this little thing\u2019s strength is actually terrifying!\u201dOne must know, with a swing of both arms, he can exert five to six thousand jin of force. Unexpectedly, a four year old almost pushed him to the ground. How could he not be shaken?\u201cCome, little guy. Come and lift the cauldron to test the strength of your body.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng said.\u201cOkay.\u201d The little guy felt as if he dodged a bullet. He rapidly broke away from the crowd of laughter. The men surrounding him all moved to the side.\u201cUp!\u201dThe little guy started off with the thousand jin cauldron and gradually pushed himself further. After that, he unexpected lifted up a black cauldron over five thousand jin. Everyone in Stone Village was petrified.One must know, the little guy was really special in the past. Being able to lift a thousand jin cauldron was enough to completely astonish anyone. Now, he can lift up the five thousand jin black cauldron in one breath. Everyone was stunned and speechless.\u201cThis isn\u2019t his limit yet! More!\u201d Shi Yunfeg trembled with unimaginable levels of excitement.Hong!The final time of lifting a cauldron, the little guy lifted the clan\u2019s heaviest cauldron right above his head. That was a eight thousand jin cauldron with a terrifying Hou engraved on it.The group of people were all incredibly shocked. This age with this type of godly strength, they had never heard of it before!\u201cChild, when you grow up, if you don\u2019t kill a genuine Archaic Descendent \u2014 A True Hou, or in other words an actual Deity that the first natives worshiped, then you will be letting me down!\u201d Shi Linghu turned around and shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For a child that wasn\u2019t even four yet was unheard of in Stone Village. All of them were stupefied, and were gaping in awe.The group of people shouted with strange noises and hurried to the little guy\u2019s side before hoisted him up in the air and pinched him all over. Is this really not a Hou in human form?\u201cLittle guy, what are you made of?\u201d Er Meng\u2019s father was rather rough, and with his mouth wide open, he exposing his snow white teeth while pinching him.The entire group of strong men were all like this. They were all pretty rough. Afterwards, a group of children also made a large commotion and ran towards him. They pinched him all over for a long time until they released him after a long while.The little guy\u2019s body was spotlessly white, sparkling and translucent. Divine splendor covered every precipice of his body, and pitch black, soft and long hair draped all over his shoulders. His eyes were sharp; he was full of energy and was in very high spirit.\u201cThe heavens truly spared my clan, giving us this kind of child!\u201d A few clan elders were incessantly chatting amongst themselves while trembling with excitement.\u201cChild, do you feel uncomfortable anywhere at all?\u201d Shi Yunfeng asked, afraid that the transformation would leave behind some dangerous side-effects.The little guy\u2019s voice was young and tender and earnestly replied \u201cNope, I feel really good. I feel so energized, like I have unlimited stamina.\u201dThe chief laughed heartily and completely now. He examined the little guy all over, and he suddenly looked as if he was ten years younger as many of the wrinkles on his face disappeared.Soon after, the little guy lifted up the 8000 jin Hou symbolled cauldron again and walked around the empty space. Although it was extremely heavy, he wasn\u2019t panting at all. This divine strength was truly startling.When he put down the Hou symbolled cauldron, the earth shook around it, causing cracks to appear as the surface shook. The villagers were shocked to the point that their eyelids started jumping out.\u201cSuch a powerful strength, making a weapon for you in the future will be annoying.\u201d An elder smiled with delight. There wasn\u2019t a trace of annoyance on him, but rather a very happy expression.\u201cBring the clan\u2019s strongest bow over here. Let\u2019s see if the little guy can pull it!\u201d Shi Linghu said with a smile on his face.This was a huge Precious Rhinoceros Horned Bow, however it was a pity that it was too thick. Although the little guy was able to pull the bow right away, his arms were not long enough, and could not completely pull it backwards.\u201cFortunately, your arms are short. Otherwise, you might pull too hard and snap this precious bow.\u201d Shi Linghu wiped off his sweat, and the villagers all bursted out in laughter.The villagers were all down-to-earth people, and all of their feelings were sincere. Everything they had on their mind could be seen on their faces. Although they were all quite crude, the feelings they send off were all very warm.\u201cLittle guy, come eat barbecue at big Auntie\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cChild, you\u2019re almost four years old, you should be considering your marriage by now. What do you think about Uncle Linghu\u2019s daughter?\u201d\u201cWe were talking about weapons, where are you guys going?\u201d\u2026The villagers were all elated. Having a child like this, as long as he grew up, he would undoubtedly shake the world. He would protect this region, and help Stone Village grow to the peak of its power.\u201cLittle guy, although your baptism was successful and your strength raised tremendously, you cannot be too prideful. There are many experts in this world, and they are all extremely terrifying.\u201d The chief warned seriously\u201cGrandpa Chief, I know!\u201d The little guy nodded.Shi Yunfung was still not completely at ease and intentionally said \u201cThey say that, during the Archaic Period, there were Divine apes wielded iron sticks that weighed 108,000 jin. They did this without the use of any precious techniques, and only relied on the strength of their flesh.The group of children were petrified and the adults were even more shocked as they became speechless. This was simply too terrifying; to simply lift up a weapon and actually wielding it were two entirely different concepts. How strong was it to actually be capable of such a feat?Afterwards, the villagers told Shi Hao to jump to see how high into the air he could leap. This time, they were frightened right away. The little guy jumped as high as he could and ended up 30 meters above the ground, and with a dong sound,\u00a0he dropped to the floor. Like a steel spear, he inserted himself solidly into the ground, cracking the earth in all four directions.\u201cMy god, when we go hunting in the forest from now on, you should follow too. I feel with your strength right now, you are on par with those huge beasts!\u201dHis body was extremely strong. The little guy\u2019s organs were sparkling and his bones were shining. His entire body was baptized, as the flickering symbols had combined with his flesh. His entire body was doused in a divine light.There was a speck of light on every inch of his flesh making him look like a deity. They embodied the symbols, and endless extracted luck from the heaven and earth before drawing it into the body.Chirp Chirp\u2026.Three little birds made their way towards the group of people. Their scales were emitting light as they fluttered their wings. Their eyes contained traces of divinity, and looked as though they wanted to open their mouths and speak. They had extraordinary strength, and so the group of children were easily pushed aside when they made their way inside.\u201cDa Peng, Xiao Qing, Zi Yun!\u201d The little guy shouted and rushed over.The three hatchlings chirped in high spirits, and used their heads to rub against his arm, showing great affection and joy. During the past half month, they were protecting a cave behind the village to guard their mother. They would only occasionally run inside the village to find the little guy.\u201cAunt Green Scaled Eagle should no longer be in any trouble right? Using the medicine by Grandpa Chief and the Mythical Flaming Devil Bull\u2019s True Blood. A complete recovery should will definitely happen.\u201d The little guy asked in concern. These two days, he was in his baptism and did not know the condition the Green Scaled Eagle.\u201cWhen we dismembered the Archaic Descendant\u2019s precious body, we already delivered it a lot of the Suan Ni\u2019s flesh. It should currently be working hard to refine the essence inside the blood.\u201d The chief said.This time, the reason they were able to fight over the Suan Ni\u2019s precious body was all because of the Green Scaled Eagle, and it fought life and limb in several bloody battles. If they didn\u2019t have its support, it would have been impossible to return with such rewards. \u00a0Stone Village would naturally not forget its kindness and bravery. These past few days, under the utmost care of the clan, the vicious bird that was on the verge of dying was slowly making its recovery. Only, since it was in such a terrible state before, unless it consumed a bit of the Bull\u2019s True Blood to detoxify itself, there might have been permanent damages. Recently, it had been gradually began to recover as the people of Stone Village fed it the flesh and blood of the Archaic Suan Ni.\u201cIf it consumed a bit more of the Archaic Descendant\u2019s flesh and blood. Perhaps it could obtain some great benefit.\u201d The little guy said.A bird cry pierced the vast skies like the descent of thunder and lightning, shocking everyone\u2019s ears until they were in pain. A huge vicious bird with green light circulating around its body soared into the skies from behind the village. It hid within the skies and covered the earth before circling around the village for a bit and then charging straight into the depths of the mountains.\u201cIt had recovered already. Could it be that it left?\u201d The little guy waved and yelled \u201cGoodbye, Aunt Green Scaled Eagle!\u201d His long cry echoed through as he said his farewells. Then, it disappeared into the clouds.\u201cIt might be making a breakthrough and decided to isolate itself in another place.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng\u2019s face congealed and said.\u201cBreakthrough?!\u201d A group of men exposed a bewildered look on their faces as they looked towards the clouds in the sky. If it strength advanced to another level, it would definitely be stronger than that vicious Wolf from the Wolf Village.Afterwards, the villagers were all extremely happy. The Green Scaled Eagle already owed them its life and also entrusted its three children to them as well. The stronger it was, the better it was for Stone Village.\u201cYou guys grew up even more!\u201d The little guy smiled.The hatchlings\u2019 body lengths had already reached three meters. Their scales were shining with precious splendor. For the past few days, they had also been eating the flesh of the Archaic Descendant and gained tremendous benefits.\u201cChief, when will we have our baptism?\u201d The group of children looked impatiently. After seeing the little guy become so strong, they were all envious, and were no longer afraid of any sort of pain.\u201cWe start now, but you guys would never be able to bear a medicine that powerful. We can\u2019t use that; we\u2019ll have to dilute it.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng stated.Suddenly, Stone Village was bustling once again. One huge cauldron after another started boiling. Archaic Descendant\u2019s True Blood filled them up, and the villagers all benefited from it.Today, Stone Village wailed like ghosts and howled like wolves. Although the children all clenched their teeth to bear their pain, they were still unable to endure it and started to cry incessantly.After sundown, everything was over. A few able-bodied men also consumed some flesh and blood. Of course they were the same as the children, unable to eat a lot of it and baptize themselves. Normal people could definitely not bear the pain.Stone Village finally calmed down after two days. The remaining True Blood and precious meat were all sealed up. They would all be slowly refined, and not even a single bit would go to waste.After handling it for several days, chief Shi Yunfeng took out a glowing\u00a0white bone as big as his palm; it was precisely that bone with the primitive symbols left behind by the Suan Ni. After the able-bodied males\u2019 several days of effort, they finally manage to retrieve that bone from its body.Luckily, after the bone produced symbols, it was no longer connected to the forehead. It had been separated for a long time and became another piece of bone all by itself. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to move.The chief said with an extremely serious tone \u201cLittle guy, don\u2019t do anything else for a few days; instead, remember these symbols safely within your heart. After a few more days, the activity on this precious bone will disappear and this symbol\u2019s mysterious imprints will disappear along with it. After it disappears, the bone would only become a precious artifact and would not yield any precious techniques.It was similar to the white gem-like beast tooth bracelet from the Wolf Village; if the white beast teeth had already condensed its symbols, its most divine secrets would no longer visible. It could only become a precious artifact and did not contain any precious techniques.The little guy heard what was said and nodded earnestly. For the entire rest of the day, he single-mindedly carried the glowing white bone while carefully analyzing it. His eyes didn\u2019t even blink, and he was concentrated to the extreme.Although it was just a symbol, it represented an entire race, and the precious technique would soon shock the world. The imprint constantly fluctuated like the stars in the vast sky. They moved about incessantly, complicated and mysterious. Only until late at night did the little guy finally successfully force himself to remember all the different variations, storing them inside his heart.\u201cGrandpa, I remember them now, but the Suan Ni\u2019s precious technique is too complicated. I won\u2019t be able to understand it for a while.\u201d The little guy said honestly.Shi Yunfeng did not say anything. If someone understood it, then they would be able to recreate the Archaic Descendant species\u2019 divine power. No one could do it right away, as this took time to digest and comprehend.\u201cTake your time, you\u2019ll understand it sooner or later. Right now, you should first comprehend the Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s precious technique thoroughly. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew, keep that in mind.\u201cGrandpa, I understand!\u201dTwo days later, groups after groups of experts charged into the mountains with the intention of entering the heart of the mountains. There was a clan riding on silver unicorns, a group of\u00a0aristocratic heirs flying on top of a large beast bone, and a group of powerful individuals sitting on a flood dragon.\u201cYa, grandpa, quickly look. This village\u2019s Guardian Spirit is so strange, why does this thunder-stricken willow tree have only a single tender branch?\u201dAn old man as well as two youths and two young maidens as pretty as fairies stood atop a snowy feather measuring five to six meters long. The pupils of their eyes were lively, as divine and holy light circulating around them.\u201cWhat an ancient and strange Guardian Spirit. Even in such a condition, it\u2019s still not dead with only one branch remaining; it must be extraordinary. After being struck by lightning, it must have given birth to a powerful force. It must certainly be rare and valuable treasure; no one fight with me over it, this willow tree is mine!\u201d A five or six year old child that was still ten meters above the ground jumped off the back of the Jiao.\u201cWhat kind of village is this, how can there be this kind of Guardian Spirit?\u201d Within the people and horses of another group, a youth stared at the old willow tree that was charred black with a startled expression.\u201cSo odd, it was met with a calamity and yet it gave birth to such power from its destruction. This tender branch must be an absolutely priceless treasure.\u201d A few people said.\u201cYou few people all want to fight over it with me, I want to see you try. Let\u2019s see who the number one genius is!\u201d The child who jumped off the back of the Jiao sneered.\u201cGood, then let\u2019s have a fight. This time, we are gambling with absolute treasures. If it\u2019s not precious blood that can transform your entire body, then don\u2019t take it out!\u201dThen, a group of adults also stopped. Their eyes contained a strange light and stared towards the willow tree. They did not oppose to the children having a battle and even encouraged the gambling over precious blood.\u201cFight then, and see who amongst you is an absolute genius. In twenty years here, let\u2019s see who sinks or floats.\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t easily go around and killing people\u2019s Guardian Spirits!\u201dA few adults opened their mouths. They were all experts whose names shook the lands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he was small, he was still very powerful and threatening. With a sneer he said \u201cThis willow branch is mine. If you guys have a problem with it then just come and give me a try.\u201dOne of Zishan Hou\u2019s children was rather handsome and pretty. He steadily and patiently said, \u201cJiao Peng, don\u2019t say such conceited words. Even if you have some skills, there\u2019s no need for such arrogance. Take care of yourself to not die within this harsh, desolate land.\u201d His name was Shan Kun and never got along with Jiao Peng from the very start. In addition, their clans were did not have a peaceful relationship, so they always opposed each other.\u201cThen let\u2019s have a fight to the death, do you dare?\u201d Jiao Peng\u2019s tone was very aggressive. His \u00a0eyes were shooting out cold beams of electricity, and they were threatening like the offspring of an Archaic Golden Peng.\u201cWhat are you arguing about? All of you immediately settle down!\u201d On the other side, a large child\u2019s eyes shot out beams of cold electricity. Above his head, black air swirled about and coldly swept over. He came from an aristocratic area and was the son of Lei Hou. He was named Lei Mingyuan, and he originally wanted to deal with Zishan Hou\u2019s most beloved son, Zishan Kun. After seeing Jiao Peng\u2019s bossy and domineering attitude, however, he became irritated.Jiao Peng and Zishan Kun heard what was said and raised their eyebrows. They were all geniuses, and had tremendous confidence in themselves. They would never lower their heads toward anyone.\u201cLei Mingyuan, are you courting death?!\u201d Jiao Peng was young, but he had a very lofty attitude. He took a step forward and the entire ground shook with a huge\u00a0dong\u00a0sound, like a huge monster was on the move.\u201cShut up!\u201d Zishan Kun also very direct and shouted. They had a grudge with the Lei clan and sparks flew whenever they met. Although the tension eased up a bit during the past few years, they still never stopped their hidden battles.\u201cOne fight to determine the victor and the loser!\u201d Lei Mingyuan shouted. He leapt vertically, and his body flew twenty meters into the air before striking towards Zishan Kun with his palm. Despite saying all this, he was still trying to carry out the commands of his father.The wind caused by his fist were black as they crackled in the air. As a result, lightning interweaved within the air, forming bristles of concentrated lightning that descended down from the skies.This was only a child, yet he had such a remarkable ability. A strange symbol appeared in his palm; it was the obscure imprints of his clan\u2019s secret and rare precious technique.Weng!Purple clouds filled the air. Zishan Hou lifted up his right hand to defend himself, and symbols flickered from his palm as well, forming a blazing light. It surged out to form a purple sun before releasing outwards.Similarly, this was also a terrifying precious technique. It was precious technique that only the Purple Mountain Clan possessed. Practiced to perfection, its power could move the heavens, as well as tremble the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers.The two forces collided, and both the black lightning and the purple light exploded. The two techniques exploded into symbols, leaving marks in the air. This scene astonished everyone.\u201cWho is the number one genius? Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m still here!\u201d \u00a0Jiao Peng suddenly executed his attack.The force from his palm was astonishing. A symbol flashed in the middle of his left palm and a Flood Dragon made completely out of light rushed outwards. This was a genuine Archaic Flood Dragon\u2019s imprint, and its aura was completely horrifying.The Great Floating Pong\u2019s ancestors met an Archaic Flood Dragon before and unexpectedly inherited its strongest precious technique. Although the descendants could not use its ability to the fullest extent, it was still extremely powerful.The Flood Dragon made bared its fangs and brandished its claws. Its entire body was a grayish brown color, and it was signaling great misfortune, as if it had just awakened from its ancient slumber to wage war in the skies!This precious technique was incredibly powerful and attacked both Zishan Kun and Lei Mingyuan at the same time. Jiao Peng was very small, but he was extremely violent. He needed to take them both on at the same time to prove that his abilities were granted by the heavens.\u201cYou\u2019re looking for death!\u201d Lei Mingyuan scoffed coldly. Black lightning gushed outwards and spread out to all ten of his fingers. Ten streaks of black light shot forth, and bristles of lightning shout out as bird cries rang out. A purple vicious bird too form from within the lightning, and its terrifying power was shocking as it dove straight down.Zishan Hou also retaliated, and purple clouds floated about as a sun flew outwards. There was a Fire Unicorn in the middle of it, emitting a frightening purple blaze. It leapt into the sky with its unmatched ferocity.Just like this, the three children were engaged in a muddled battle. They all attacked each other and drew surprising glances from everyone.Although they were still young, each of them were incredibly powerful. Their seniors all secretly nodded in approval and at the same time, they were in awe of the abilities of their opponents possessed.\u201cSo boring, they can\u2019t even fight with the intent to kill. With all these old men here, they can\u2019t fight with all their might.\u201d A child from the spectating group of children sneered.\u201cExactly! True geniuses blessed by the heavens are born from great internal wars. What does this count as?\u201d Another child sneered as well.\u201cWhat are you guys talking about? This is also a life and death battle!\u201d The three children who were fighting fiercely were immediately angered. They expanded the range they fought in to include involved those two children as well.This was a chaotic battle. Although they were still young, they all possessed breathtaking abilities as they demonstrated their terrifying talents, shocking all the spectators.Inside Stone Village, a group of naughty children were entertaining themselves when they were suddenly startled by the activities in the forest. They ran towards the front of the village and saw many villagers suddenly scared off their feet. They were all focused on what was happening outside.\u201cHow did so many people appeared?\u201dAfter seeing Jiao Peng and the others battling, they were all speechless. They were all able to grasp the strength of the Bone Text so well that the children all became jealous. Quickly, all of their attention had been diverted again. They saw a mutated scaled horse \u2014 a unicorn. Scales all over its body shone in a bright light, and the horn on its head shone like crystal; this was an extraordinary horse.\u201cI heard uncle Linhu say that this type of mountain beast\u2019s speed is extremely fast and that it can travel ten thousand li in a day. Last time, they met some in the desolate lands and chased them for several days without seeing a trace of hair.\u201d Shi Dazhuang said.Those experts in the forest were sharp and naturally heard everything, however they all stared blankly at what they heard. According to them, this was a mountain village that fell behind and was not able to produce any experts. However, these children\u2019s words amazed them. Unicorns were a type of rarely seen ferocious beast. If they truly went berserk, then their \u201cvicious\u201d descriptions would be evident. They were powerful, yet a few villagers dared to chase them?How could they know that Shi Linhu and the others begged the chief for the two Ancestral Artifacts in order to wildly chase after them? A unicorn was able to traverse ten thousand li in a day. For men in these desolate lands, the unicorn was incredibly enticing.\u201cYou guys, look, there\u2019s a twenty meter long Jiao spiraling in the air. It has water sacs both thick and thin, and was actually hiding two long wings. Such a strong vicious beast, It must certainly taste good right?\u201d\u201cEr Meng you food tank, is this stuff for eating? This stuff is to be refined into medicine. Even though it\u2019s not a pure-blooded Archaic Descendant, its blood is still very precious.\u201d Pi Hou retorted.Outside the village, a group of experts were petrified and were a bit stupefied. Such a strong Jiao would unexpectedly be treated as food or medicine? What kind of village was this?\u201cThis Jiao certainly looks really good to eat, but it can\u2019t possibly be sweeter than the flesh of a Suan Ni. If it\u2019s not an Archaic Descendant species, then its true blood can\u2019t possibly compare.\u201d Another nasally child added.They had eaten the flesh of a Suan Ni for the past few days and also baptized in its true blood. After that, their expectations were extremely high. They thought they had been talking quietly, but they were definitely heard by those groups of experts.Whether it\u2019s the Purple Mountain Clan, Lightning Clan or Jiao Clan who came from the Great Floating Pool, all of them felt their nerves burst. Did they hear wrong?Where did this village come from? Casually eating the flesh of a Suan Ni and didn\u2019t look up to this formidable flying Flood Dragon in awe? One must know that this was an extremely terrifying vicious beast; normal experts would be far from being its opponent.\u201cChild, what did you say?!\u201d Jiao Peng who was in the middle of his intense battle became angry. His eyes were cold and shot out a terrifying look towards the village entrance.\u201cHis eyes are so clear, chilling people down to the bone. Why do I feel that it\u2019s similar in strength to that Guardian Spirit we killed, that vicious wolf?\u201d Er Meng muttered. He believed that he was talking quietly, but just like before, he was still heard by those people in the forest.What? Killed a Guardian Spirit? The group of experts all trembled and almost turned to stone. Even they did not dare to easily provoke a Guardian Spirit. Even the people from the Great Floating Pool were rather prudent in killing Guardian Spirits.This was because behind each of those lifeforms potentially stood a terrifying and ancient deity. Recently, they came out by themselves for the sake of finding nirvana within human clans. They also wished to tread on the path towards becoming an ancient deity.\u201cWhat a pity, we couldn\u2019t eat that Guardian Spirit since it was instantly turned to dust.\u201d Pi Hou regretfully said.The group of people were stunned. How terrifying is this village? Why did all of this seem so fishy? Everyone was at a loss.\u201cIt\u2019s so infuriating, are you babies looking for death?!\u201d Jiao Peng was infuriated from being ignored.\u201cWow, so vicious!\u201d\u201cYi, could that idiot hear what we\u2019re talking about?\u201d Pi Hou was doubtful since they were very far away.\u201cGe ji\u201d\u00a0A light laughter echoed through as they heard everything. Standing on the snowy feather, those two young maiden in the air laughed with glee as they swayed back and forth. Although they were wearing different attires, their appearances were identical. Their skin was as white as gems, and they were otherworldly beautiful as they vividly glanced everywhere with their big eyes.\u201cVery interesting, is he naturally stupid or doing it on purpose?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s on purpose, Jiao Peng\u00a0almost went crazy after hearing him.\u201dThe two young maidens laughed nonstop. Although they were young, they were clearly identical peerless beauties with their bright eyes, long lashes, sparking and adorable.The elders of Lightning Clan and Purple Mountain Clan all stepped forth and told the children to stop their battle. They wanted to personally see what was going on with this strange village. Could this actually be a hidden family of terrifying experts that still remained from ancient times?\u201cYou bunch of wild children, you dare to laugh at me!\u201dAfter they stopped their fight, Jiao Peng shook both his arms. Like a vicious bird, he leapt twenty meters towards the village entrance, wanting to take action on those children.In a stone house at the village entrance, the little guy ran out. He was pretty and tender and said \u201cYa, how come so many people came?\u201d\u201cWei, little guy you\u2019re still secretly drinking milk right? When did you stop?\u201d A group of bigger children teased when they found out the little guy had milk stains at the corner of his mouth.\u201cNo, no, you guys have problem with your eyes!\u201d The little guy hastily wiped his mouth and didn\u2019t want to admit it even if he was beaten to death. He put his little milk-stained hand behind his back as his eyes turned back and forth.\u201cWhat a cute child.\u201d The two young maidens on the snowy feather were incredibly surprised. After seeing the jade-like little guy being this charmingly naive, they happily started smiling.At this time, Jiao Peng came towards them, and lifted his palm and made a slapping motion. The sound of wind whistled through as this this terrifying and shocking thousand jin strength made its way through the air.\u201cYa, big bro, what are you trying to do?\u201d The little guy opened his eyes wide when he found something fishy. Jiao Peng\u2019s strength was too great as he charged towards Er Meng and Pi Hou.He rapidly came to the front and his aura suddenly changed. As he extended his little tender hand to collide with Jiao Peng\u2019s palm, the sound of wind and thunder was produced.Hong!Sand and dust flew everything and shook the mountain. The little guy stood there motionless. Jiao Peng, seemingly as if he was struck by lightning staggered backwards. Wherever his step reached the ground, a terrifying crack appeared as the ground shook back and forth. One step after another, he backed up almost ten meters and almost fell straight on the ground.\u201cWow, what a strong child!\u201d The two young maiden\u2019s eyes shone bright and leaped off the snowy feather and ran towards the front with the intention of pinching the little guy\u2019s cheeks.The little guy bashfully stepped back. His big bright eyes blinked and looked towards Jiao Peng and said \u201cBig bro, what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\u201dThe corner of his mouth still had some milk stains that he did not completely wipe away. With his black eyes that looked like precious gems shone in addition to his earnest attitude, it made those two elf-like maidens like him even more as they wanted to tease him.At the rear, the group of experts were petrified. This little f*cker was still a milk-feeding baby, yet he was able to deflect the palm of the famous genius Jiao Peng? It was like they\u2019ve seen a ghost!What kind of terrifying village was this? The group of people were dumbstruck and speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt a fracturing pain. He absolutely did not think that a child still feeding on milk was almost able to knock him to the ground.Everyone was shocked. Was this really a desolate village? It was most likely a hidden clan of ancient descent!Many people were held back by their fear. If it was true, then a hidden clan that lived in seclusion in the middle of the mountains would be too terrifying. Although their population was low, each of them must be terrifying experts.Those two beautiful young maidens walked forward with a glitter in their eyes. A smile hung on their faces as their lustering white foreheads shone with intelligence. One of the young maidens asked \u201cLittle brother, how old are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m almost four years old.\u201d The little guy\u2019s big round eyes showed a clear expression as he answered. At the same time he quickly wiped away the milk stain at the corner of his mouth to cover it up more.What? A baby who\u2019s not even four years old? This was too shocking, and everyone lost their cool as they breathed in cold air.Jiao Peng\u2019s eyes shot out beams of like a wild beast. His expression was terrible and he wanted to immediately activate his clan\u2019s strongest precious technique to beat the little guy down into the ground with a single palm.\u201cAgain!\u201d \u00a0He did not use the Jiao clan\u2019s precious technique and still used his corporeal strength. He charged forth like a violent gale as his fist whizzed through the air. The trees in the vicinity violently trembled and all the leaves and foliage fell to the ground.Like huge beasts making movements within the boundless mountain range, he brought with him a violent gust of wind. Jiao Peng\u2019s momentum was astonishing as he pounced towards the little guy.\u201cBig bro, why are you trying to bully me?\u201d The little guy did not understand as his big eyes shined with purity and innocence. He stared at Jiao Peng, extended his arms and swatted in front of him.Hong!This time, everyone clearly saw this cute child used only the strength of his flesh and did not incorporate any mysterious power or precious techniques and simply just pushed outwards. However, his power was incredible and his strength was ferocious. It left people speechless. With a\u00a0Weng sound, he pushed Jiao Peng back.The genius from the Great Floating Pool was continuously forced backwards, and the earth cracked with each step he took. His arms spasmed as he groaned in pain.\u201cSo strong!\u201d Jiao Peng clenched his teeth and exposed an incomprehensible expression. This time, he truly lost face because he was dominated by a baby still feeding on milk. His face burnt up with fury.\u201cHaha\u2026.\u201d Lei Mingyuan was over six years old. He took joy in seeing Jiao Peng in pain as he swayed back and forth in laughter.Aside from his, the others did not have a trace of laugher. If one considered Jiao Peng a genius, then what was this child?\u201cThis child\u2019s potential is frightening. If he participated in the great competitions within huge clans, then he might actually\u2026\u201d A few people casually discussed.The children shook as they heard everything, and they kept looking at the little guy. These types of geniuses were destined to participate in that terrifying competition. Sooner or later, they would certainly meet.\u201cHai\u2026\u2026\u201d Purple Mountain Clan\u2019s elder Zishan Shou sighed. He had a high standing within his family and had great influence. Right now, he still had a kind expression as he said \u201cChild, what\u2019s this village called.\u201d\u201cStone Village.\u201d The little guy replied with a crisp tone.\u201cCan you let us inside to rest a while and get a drink of water?\u201d Zishan Hou asked in an amiable manner.Right now, Jiao Peng was already restrained by that middle-aged man from the Great Floating Pool. The experts from all the other villages also walked forward since they wanted to clearly explore this strange village\u201cSo adorable.\u201d The two young maidens as pretty as fairies stood beside the little guy for a long time. They adored him as they pinched his little cheeks.\u201cSisters, what are you doing?\u201d Little Shi Hao evaded.\u201cCan you bring us into the village for a look?\u201d The two young maidens asked.\u201cLittle guy, what happened?\u201d The adults from the village appeared and approached the forest.Finally, those from the Purple Mountain Clan, Great Floating Pool and the other experts all entered the village. They observed every detail and paid especially close attention to the old willow tree.However, the burnt black willow tree did not have a trace of movement. Even though there were people moving around secretly, it never paid attention to them.After entering the village, these experts began to have some doubt. These stone houses and the limestone streets all seemed very ordinary and did not possess any extraordinary attributes. It was no different from any other villages within the desolate lands.\u201cYi, these cauldrons are ancient. Many of these had already experienced years of hardship.\u201d Zishan Shou came from an aristocratic territory and had a high standing within his clan. Naturally, he was rather experienced.The few cauldrons in the middle of the village held an ancient history. Simple and natural carvings of birds, beasts, fish and bugs attracted many people\u2019s attention.\u201cThese cauldrons seem out of the ordinary, what do you do with these normally?\u201d The middle-aged man from the Great Floating Pool, Jiao Cang asked.\u201cOh, we use these to train our strength.\u201d \u00a0Er Meng replied as picked up a thousand jin cauldron over his head.Everyone\u2019s hearts skipped. An eight or nine year old child lifted up a thousand jin cauldron with such ease. Even though it didn\u2019t mean much within a large clan, but for a little mountain village, it was a great deal.Additionally, none of the children here looked simple.These experts began to doubt again. Was this actually a hidden clan? So mysterious!Er Meng originally already could lift the thousand jin cauldron, and after baptizing in the true blood of the Suan Ni, his strength had improved by an entire level. Doing these types of things would naturally be much easier.But these experts didn\u2019t know that and thought every child was like this. Within their clans, the number of geniuses were limited. Not everyone was like Jiao Peng or Zishan Kun.The majority of children were far from Er Meng. An eight or nine year old with such strength was remarkable.\u201cBig uncle, did you bring that flying Flood Dragon to eat or to refine its True Blood?\u201d Er Meng dim-wittedly asked.\u201cWhat does a dumb kid like you know? Don\u2019t speak anymore!\u201d Er Meng\u2019s father slapped his head and said \u201cThese types of vicious Flood Dragons are rare and hard to tame. They must bring them back and breed baby Flood Dragons before you can eat them or refine their true blood. That\u2019s a true long-term plan.\u201dThe people from the Great Floating Pool became depressed. They thought this rough looking man would originally lecture the child or say something reasonable. Instead, these barbaric words came out, could it be that everyone in this village was this weird?This wasn\u2019t a Tree Pig or a Mud Cow, and it certainly wasn\u2019t food. This was an ultra-strong vicious beast. Such terrifying power, who would be willing to part with it.Everyone\u2019s eyes began to burn intensely as they stared towards Er Meng\u2019s gather. They wanted to carefully observe him, but they did not discover any traces of a symbol\u2019s power. Could it be that he\u2019s hiding his power?\u201cThe vicious aura in these few cauldrons are so strong. You just bathed in the true blood of Archaic Descendants not long ago right?!\u201dLei Hou\u2019s fourth son was a twenty year old young man. His name was Lei Yunkun. He stood tall and upright as black lightning appeared in his eyes. He left the group and stood in front of the medicine cauldron, showing a shocked expression.The group of men all followed and closed their eyes. They carefully felt their surroundings and then opened their eyes in shock. It was absolutely the blood of a terrifying beast king that unexpectedly died here.\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t refine an Archaic Descendant here right?\u201d His balloon was just popped, the depressed Jiao Peng finally could not bear and opened his mouth.\u201cScared yet?\u201d The nasally child was resentful towards Jiao Peng as he said with a childish\u00a0tone.\u201cWhat kind of vicious beast?\u201d The genius Zishan Kun said and showed a curious expression.\u201cAn ultra-strong Suan Ni.\u201d The nasally child blurted out.\u201cYou dumb kid!\u201d His father scolded but it was already too late.The nasally kid just remembered the warnings of the Chief. \u201cDo not speak of the Archaic Descendants, otherwise, it might instill a huge disaster.\u201d The kid felt stupid and said in a light voice \u201cI forget, the Chief said, we had to keep this thing low-profile.\u201dHowever, after it reached the ears of those experts, these words held significant meaning. These mother f*ckers were definitely a hidden clan. These people wanted to keep a low-profile and didn\u2019t want to show off.Otherwise, who would just casually eat Suan Ni\u2019s meat? With just a tiny amount of pure blood, these types of creatures\u2019 power would overflow the heavens, and even more so with an Archaic Descendent that would be able to able to instill endless fear to the largest of clans.\u201cYou are positive that you guys ate a Suan Ni?\u201d Jiao Peng asked with his eyes wide open. He lost his domineering attitude for the moment and showed the curiosity and astonishment of a child.One must know that even the Great Floating Pool wouldn\u2019t indiscriminately disturb Archaic Descendants like a Suan Ni. Although they had baptized in similar blood, it didn\u2019t mean they could eat their meat often.Because in large clans, the rarer the Archaic Descendants, the finer they would prepare them. Every inch of its blood and bones would be refined into medicine. How could they afford to just eat it like that?The group of experts were left completely speechless. How strong was their background if they dared to directly eat the flesh of a precious Suan Ni?At this moment, although the group of experts came from large clans and knew many things, they felt suspicious of their surroundings. They had already determined that this was a terrifying hidden clan that absolutely could not be provoked.\u201cWhere is your Chief, this senior wants to pay his respects.\u201d Zishan Shou was in feathered clothing and a gold hat. Strands of purple clouds surrounded his body, and he had a strong and imposing aura. However, he constantly held back and did not dare to do as he pleased.\u201cThe Chief closed himself off in isolation and will not come out for a while.\u201d Er Meng said.\u201cDumb kid, you really have a lot to say don\u2019t you!\u201d His father extended his fan-like palm and spanked him with a loud\u00a0Pa\u00a0sound.Er Meng felt wronged and didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. He wasn\u2019t warned to not speak of this matter. When the Chief drank the precious blood of the Suan Ni, he felt the disease within his body getting better and therefore decided to concentrate on cultivated in isolation.Zishan Shou, Jiao Cang and the others looked at each other. They had a clear understanding and felt that this was definitely an extraordinary Chief. The stronger a person is, the longer they would seal themselves off in isolation.Finally, the group gazed towards the old willow tree again. With such a mysterious village, the willow tree that\u2019s rooted here must certainly be extraordinary right?\u201cThis is a Guardian Spirit right? What do you call it?\u201d Lei Yunkun carefully asked.\u201cOh, just call it Guardian Spirit or call it Willow Deity.\u201d Pi Hou answered. Children\u2019s words were the most genuine, naturally making it sound more believable.\u201cWhat, Willow Deity?!\u201d The group of experts almost leapt up. Even Zishan Shou with his powerful influence and a mighty aristocratic background almost staggered back in shock.A mysterious village and a terrifying Guardian Spirit Name\u2026 this made everyone dumbstruck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This word must not be used carelessly. To ordinary clans, this was an omnipotent and supreme being.During the ancient era, the first natives held firm in their beliefs and paid close attention to the offerings they made to the Deities. They believed that Deities certainly existed, and in the utmost important times, they could be summoned for protection.In fact, through the insights gained by later generations, it came to light that what the tribes kneeled down and worshiped to were actually unique and powerful creatures. These creatures included the true Hou and pure-blooded Pi Hou, and they were all creatures that could be considered the pinnacle of life.In the distant past, the first natives worshiped these creatures with their respect and sacrifices in order to receive their protection.However, there were mortals that dared to call themselves Deities, and they had the strength to battle with ancient vicious beasts. They had strength that defied the heavens, and with a wave of their hands, they could exterminate huge clans with an unfathomable level of divine power; it was simply impossible to resist.Rumor has it that vast and boundless ancient countries were still sacrificing to the heavens and conducting ancient ceremonies to this day. Although endless years had passed by, there might be traces left behind by these ancient countries\u2019 mysterious and terrifying deities.The people of Stone Village addressed this willow tree as a Deity. How could people not be surprised? This title couldn\u2019t be given sparingly.\u201cYou are positive this senior Guardian Spirit did not oppose being called a Deity?\u201d A youngster slightly over ten from the Purple Mountain Clan asked with careful consideration.\u201cNot at all, the Willow Deity is kind and always protected our clan.\u201d Er Meng recklessly saidA Guardian Spirit that did not oppose being called a Deity. When this information was released, all of the experts immediately had a change of heart. They couldn\u2019t help but take a step back, as they all feared this burnt back and dying willow treeBut all those life forms that became a human clan\u2019s Guardian Spirit had some relations to a Deity. They could have even been a direct descendant of an ancient Deity. They were especially afraid of a title like this and did not dare to provoke and ridicule Deities; all of them held themselves back.The willow tree in front of them had the impertinence to continuously act in such a manner, and did not oppose being referred to in such a way. This proved that its power was terrifying, and it most likely had the strength to defy the heavens long ago; it didn\u2019t care at all.There\u2019s no way that it is actually an ancient deity whose strength was already on the decline and on the verge of dying right? This was what many people thought in their heads but did not dare to speak out.Faced with this turn of events, they all felt reverence within their hearts and felt rather uneasy. They no longer dared to act as they pleased, and began to walk carefully and cautiously.However, they still felt unresigned, and wanted to understand where this hidden clan came from. They also wanted to find out what kind of divine powers the \u201cWillow Deity\u201d had, and what divine artifacts it bestowed.One must know that an artifact made by a genuine ancient Deity had to be extraordinary and heaven-defying. Everyone secretly hoped that if they offered their best sacrifices, the willow tree would in turn help them.They politely said that they wished to stay for a while. But although Shi Linghu and the others were simple-minded, they weren\u2019t foolish. They realized something was fishy and stated that there were only a few rooms and that there weren\u2019t many places to live.Although Shi Feijiao and the others wished that they left as soon as possible, these people certainly didn\u2019t give up. One after the other, they expressed that they did not need to enter the village and that simply living outside would suffice. They claimed that their only wish was that they could drink water from inside the village.Those powerful experts from the Purple Mountain Clan, Great Floating Pond, Lightning Clan, the Golden Wolf Tribe and the Heavenly Cloud Palace all stayed behind. They originally wanted to enter the depths of the mountain and scout out the mysteries behind the mountain\u2019s treasures.\u201cVenerable brother, do you know about the matter within the mountains? I heard that there was some extraordinary mountain treasure that made the Archaic Descendants go mad over them. Did you guys go look for them?\u201d The Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s leader said to Shi Feijiao amiably as he tied up his unicorn.\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it, but our Chief won\u2019t let us go. To obtain those things, you need to be either an especially talented individual or a vicious beast; otherwise, only death awaits.\u2026On the other side, Lei Yunkun took out a jar of Spirit Flowers and placed them into boiling water. Soon after, they became a fragrant perfume, overflowing with spiritual essence. He invited the villagers who were close to him in age to drink and converse with them.Comparatively speaking, the children were a bit purer.The two young maidens from the Heavenly Cloud Palace were chatting and laughing with the little guy. Sometimes, they pinched the little guy\u2019s tender cheeks because they felt that this child was too adorable.\u201cWe\u2019ve drank the rich, sweet milk of the Snow Scaled Leopard. When I was young, I drank a cup every single day.\u201d A young maiden said happily.\u201cEn, a beast\u2019s milk is really fragrant and very delicious.\u201d The little guy nodded as they unexpectedly started talking about milk.\u201cLittle guy what kind of milk do you like best?\u201d The two young maidens were identical. They were fine, exquisite and pretty. From time to time, they would rub the little guy\u2019s shiny jet black hair.\u201cFire Tiger, Moon Rhinoceros, Dragon Horned Elephant\u2026. if you mix these together into a hundred beast milk then it\u2019d taste the best.\u201d\u2026Zishan Kun, Lei Mingyuan and the others walked past here and rolled their eyes. What was this; they were unexpectedly talking about this stuff.Especially Jiao Peng, the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He was defeated and humiliated by a milk-feeding child. However now, under the assumption that this was a hidden clan under the protection of a deity, he could only be extremely angry; he did not dare to act imprudently.After four hours, the group of experts began to have some doubts. Stone Village was a bit odd. They\u2019ve been repeatedly investigating, only to find that most of them did not understand the Bone Text at all! Shouldn\u2019t a hidden family be able to at least reflect that?\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, it shouldn\u2019t be possible that everyone is hiding right. Why can\u2019t the presence of an expert who has mastered the Bone Text be felt?\u201cEn, there\u2019s a problem. It shouldn\u2019t be that we\u2019re scaring ourselves right?\u201dThese people were sharp. If even the tiniest traces of evidence were placed before them, they would immediately find a trail or a loophole. Earlier under their first impression, they were misled by various weird things.Only now did that end. After getting into contact with the people of Stone Village, they slowly detected abnormalities. They began to realize that it might have been possible that they were overly nervous and made a mistake. Many people\u2019s faces were starting to become unpleasant.Jiao Peng\u2019s lungs were about to burst. Zishan Kun, Lei Mingyuan and the other geniuses were also depressed and those strong youths began to develop a downcast expression. All of them did not look well as they believed that they had been played.If this news got out, they would become a laughing stock. A few strong clans were almost scared by Stone Village; this would eventually become a fantastic story.\u201cUncle Cang, I just found out, this burnt willow tree had only appeared several tens of years ago. It can\u2019t possibly be a Guardian Deity from the ancient era. Also, after so many years, this willow tree had never talked with this village at all. I feel like it has already lost many of its powers as a Guardian Spirit.\u201d Jiao Peng\u2019s face was ugly as he clenched his teeth.Jiao Cang and the other could not hold out any longer. They made such a mistake under their first impression. Fortunately, no one did anything that would truly cause them to lose face such as offering a sacrifice in front of the willow tree.The people from the Purple Mountain Ranges were muttering as well and came to the same conclusion. Purple clouds were rising above Zishan Shou\u2019s head and mist began to curl around his entire body like a great purple furnace. He was furious, but he did not explode and quickly restrained himself.\u201cGrandpa, they won\u2019t become angry right? If they find this village unfavorable, then what would we do?\u201d The two young maidens from Heavenly Cloud palace began to worry.\u201cThe majority of them won\u2019t go far\u2026.\u201dAn elderly man who held the Snow Feather said.When the sky darkened, these groups of people began to get a gist of what\u2019s going on. They knew they were wrong. This wasn\u2019t some hidden family, but it was certainly possible that they accidentally obtained the carcass of a Suan Ni.After this speculation came to light. Not only the people from the Great Floating Pond, but even the Golden Wolf Tribe began to tremble as they thought about what kind of powerful precious techniques this Stone Village could hold.Without a doubt, a Suan Ni\u2019s primitive symbols were extremely precious, and it was to the point that even a large clan would covet and envy it. An expert\u2019s precious techniques from an Archaic Descendant would usually be a family\u2019s strongest and most remarkable ability.For these types of things, the more the better. Moreover, under normal circumstances, a clan would only have one extremely strong precious technique with many other smaller abilities to assist that main technique.It was precisely because they were so rare that made them so precious!\u201cWei, you wild children have been boasting too much. Talking about chasing a unicorn and killing a Guardian Spirit, you\u2019re not scared of lightning striking your tongue?\u201d Jiao Peng\u2019s face was terrible as he stared at Er Meng, the nasally kid and the others.The villagers were astonished, especially the children. They felt waves of chilling air. How could they have a change of heart so quickly?As geniuses, they were certainly unruly, and ordinarily, they were untamable. Jiao Peng had been holding out for so long; now he wanted to take matters into his own hands.Jiao Cang did not stop him to see what kind of reaction Stone Village would have. The others watched with folded arms as they watched these course of events unfold.\u201cBig bro, why can\u2019t you see reason?\u201d The little guy walked forward and stretched out his little arms to block his path. He faced Jiao Peng before and knew how difficult he was to deal with. He feared that he might hurt Er Meng or the nasally kid.Jiao Peng was young, but right now he gloomily replied, \u201cReason? You\u2019re just a milk-feeding baby who doesn\u2019t understand that in this world, reason could only reached as far as where your fist could!\u201d\u201cBig bro, we stay away from worldly affairs and like peace. We do not want to have a conflict with you. Please don\u2019t be offended or get angry. If we had mistreated you, we will apologize.\u201dA child talking with milk on the corner of his mouth made some of the experts feel embarrassed.The elderly man from the Heavenly Cloud Palace stood up and said \u201cLet it go. The people here are unsophisticated. Why make things difficult for them.\u201d When he said these thing, he looked towards the middle-aged man from the Great Floating Pond, Jiao Cang, because he was needlessly polite towards Jiao Peng.However, everyone from Stone Village ate a Suan Ni and obtained a holy object \u2014 the precious bone. It made many of these experts\u2019 eyes green with envy. Many of them wanted it for themselves and had a hard time composing themselves.\u201cThis village was playing with us. There were indeed things wrong here.\u201d The people from Golden Wolf Tribe said.Chirp Chirp\u2026.Suddenly, a few chirping sounds echoed through. Da Peng, Xiao Qing and Zi Yun, the three hatchlings all fluttered their wings and ran towards them. They were incredibly intelligent and rushed towards where the little guy stood.These few days, they constantly underwent transformations. After devouring the Suan Ni\u2019s flesh, to these devil birds whose blood vessels were strong, they obtained unimaginable benefits. Da Peng\u2019s eyes became gold, and splendid stripes appeared on Xiao Qing\u2019s wings. Zi Yun\u2019s purple scales became even more splendid.There was no need for explaining. After seeing those three hatchlings, they immediately understood that these were rare birds who had certainly inherited the true blood of an Archaic Devil Bird. Additionally, they underwent some transformations, so they were even more precious.\u201cThese are my prey, none of you will steal them from me!\u201d Jiao Long said in an overbearing tone. He removed a precious bow from his back and directly pulled it fully to shoot an iron arrow.Jiao Cang from the Great Floating Pond did not stop him. He only watched coldly from the sidelines.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s yours just because you say it is?\u201d ZiShan Kun and Lei Mingyuan also came and similarly took out their bows and considered those three hatchlings their prey.The group of experts were all amazed. These were three abnormal transformed hatchlings. If they grew up, they would be extremely powerful, and would become incredibly powerful Guardian Creatures.\u201cYou can\u2019t hurt Zi Yun and the others!\u201d The little guy and the others became angry. His eyes lit up and stared at Jiao Peng and the others as he extended his little snow white hands to block them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He used his strength to arch his bow into a full moon armed with a cold iron arrow aimed straight towards those three hatchlings.ChiA cold light whistled through the air with\u00a0wuwu\u00a0sounds, and a strong gale that made sounds like the cries of a ghost threw itself at Zi Yun. He designated this bird as his prey, because it was the one that appeared to be the most mystical. It\u2019s entire body unexpectedly gave off a glistening and dazzling purple and golden luster; this made him want to capture it after injuring it with his arrows.With a\u00a0qiang\u00a0sound, the little guy threw himself in front of the attack. His snow white hands slapped the iron arrow, causing it to stray from its trajectory. Everyone was shocked stiff; this little fellow\u2019s speed was simply too fast! With just a leap, he was able to intercept such a ferocious and powerful arrow.\u201cWhy are you being so fierce? Why do you want to hurt Zi Yun and the others?\u201d Shi Hao was angry as his eyes widened.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d Jiao Peng shouted in a loud voice. His eyebrows stood up and aimed his arrows towards the little guy as he held a cold smile on his face.He was tyrannical and powerful, and it made Er Meng, Pi Hou, the nasally kid and the others mad with fury; they\u2019ve never met anyone so unreasonable. These three birds were raised by the villagers, yet he wanted to injure them and take them for himself!\u201cWhy won\u2019t you be reasonable?\u201d Shi Dazhuang was angry. He lifted up a thousand jin cauldron and wanted to charge forward right away.\u201cBig bro Dazhuang, back off!\u201d The little guy said because he knew that aside from him, no one was capable of being Jiao Peng\u2019s opponent.\u201cIf you don\u2019t back off, then don\u2019t blame me for ruthlessly shooting my arrows!\u201d Jiao Peng said coldly and indifferently. His age and his expressions did not seem to match at all.\u201cDa Peng, Zi Yun, you guys go back.\u201d Shi Hao opened his mouth and told them to retreat in advance. He was afraid that they might be injured, and protectively stood in front of them.\u201cNot one of them will leave, these three vicious birds are my prey!\u201d Jiao Peng said coldly and once again drew his bow. He aimed his bow forward, and the cold radiance from the arrowheads assailed flickered as it permeated the air with a murderous aura.Hu\u2026.\u00a0the sound of wind whistled past. One the other side, Zishan Kun and Lei Mingyuan also began to take action as they were afraid of falling behind Jiao Peng. They charged towards the three hatchlings with their bows in hand, aiming to hunt them down.Da Peng, Xiao Qing and Zi Yun all understood human nature. Apart from not being able to speak their language, their intelligence were not any bit inferior to humans. They already figured out what was happening in front of their eyes, causing them to be extremely angry.The little guy jumped up and stood in the way of these two. He said in his soft and tender voice \u201cThese are my partners, you cannot injure them!\u201dAt that moment, Shi Linghu and the others were all alarmed and a group of people rushed out in spitting anger. They considered these people guests before and never thought that they would actually be such tyrannical bullies.\u201cThis isn\u2019t too good right?\u201d The elderly man from Heavenly Cloud Palace spoke again to mediate the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s just a few angry children. Just let them have a fight to see who the number one genius is. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Some of them were trying to smooth things over, as they wanted the precious bones of the Suan Ni from Stone Village, but didn\u2019t have any excuse to do so. They wanted the situation to become a bit noisier.As for Jiao Cang from the Great Floating Pond, he was always cold and indifferent. He did not show any didn\u2019t move in to stop Jiao Peng. The Purple Mountain Clan and the Thunder Clan were also expressionless, and had the detached views of bystanders. They all allowed their own children take actions while awaiting the results.\u201cGood, since this is the children\u2019s problem, then let us simply spectate well and not take part in this.\u201d The elderly man from Heavenly Cloud Temple nodded and didn\u2019t add anything else.Although Shi Linghu and the others were in rage, after seeing the little guy wave his hand, they suppressed it. They understood that the situation in front of their eyes was critical, and that these were all frightening people.Chi, Chi\u2026..Jiao Peng suddenly armed his bow and shot out a string of dazzling cold arrows. all of them whistled viciously through the air towards those three birds.The little guy quickly stopped them, but it wasn\u2019t only Jiao Peng who took action. The other two, Zishan Kun and Lei Mingyuan also needed to be guarded against. In addition, Jiao Peng shot quite a few arrows and it was difficult to stop all of them.Dang!Immediately, sparks flew everywhere. The iron arrows landed on those three young bird\u2019s bodies and\u00a0keng qiang\u00a0noises sounded out, as if it were metal colliding against each other with extreme force.Da Peng cried out and fluttered his wings with all his strength to smack the iron arrows. Although it had powerful scales for protection, it still sustained some injuries. Fresh blood spilt out and many green scales dropped to the ground.Qiang, qiang\u2026.The other two hatchlings were also struck by arrows. Xiao Qing wailed as blood splashed out.Jiao Peng\u2019s strength was incredible. Although he was only five years old, his arms contained several thousand jin of force. The penetrative power of his arrows were terrifying.Although the three hatchlings were extraordinary and learning the Bone Text with Shi Hao, they were only born only around three months ago. They were too immature and had great difficulties using the precious technique. The protection offered by their scales were far inferior to those of an adult Green Scaled Eagle\u2019s scales. Apart from Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing were both injured; their scales fell and blood splashed out.The little guy was extremely angry. He flew over and used his body to block in front of the three hatchlings as he stared toward Jiao Peng.\u201cF*ck off!\u201d Jiao Peng was domineering. His eyes were ice cold as he aimed his iron arrows straight at Shi Hao. He pulled his bow back all the way, aiming straight at his throat.The villagers were angry. The three hatchlings grew up in Stone Village and would eventually become members here. Unexpectedly, there were people brazen enough to run inside the village to hunt and steal them; it was truly intolerable.\u201cDon\u2019t force me!\u201d To force the little guy to speak these words, anyone was able to see how angry he was.\u201cSo what if I force you?\u201d Jiao Peng provoked. He lost a confrontation with his corporeal body before and that made him feel quite unwell. He had decided to reveal his precious technique a long time ago.Xiu!A cold streak of radiance flew through the air as Jiao Peng released his bow, aiming straight at the little guy\u2019s throat. It was fast and terrifying as it whistled and ripped through the air.Bang!The little guy\u2019s movements were simple, yet they were steady and accurate. With a\u00a0Pa\u00a0sound,\u00a0he grabbed the cold and terrifying iron arrow. After exerting his own strength, the cold bristles flourished and the iron arrow flew back towards Jiao Peng. At the same time, he instantly leapt twenty meters as if he was a dragon and dove past. Although he was small, his strength was terrifyingly strong.The little guy took the initiative and attacked Jiao Peng!\u201cI\u2019ve waited for a long time already for this!\u201d Jiao Peng stood with his head held high. He had already lost once before, and it was now time to win it back.He threw away his bow and arrows and spread out his body like a strong and flexible Demonic Ape. He shifted his feet and moved ten meters horizontally across the ground. Symbols flickered on both his arms before quickly shining and wrapping him in a layer of precious splendor, enshrouding him underneath.\u201cUncivilized baby, living in the mountains, you have no idea how vast the heaven and earth in the outer world is. Right now I\u2019ll show you the power of the Bone Text!\u201d Jiao Peng\u2019s words were ice cold.After both his arms were completely shining, he began to feel confident in his own power, and actively rushed towards the little guy. He wanted to oppress him with his absolute strength. As symbols flickers, his speed was shockingly fast.The little guy did not utter a word as he descended from midair in order to confront the enemy\u2019s killing technique. Multicolored light blossomed from within his body, and divine light gushed outwards. Heavenly and earthly powers were refined, and his fingers suddenly shined in a precious white.Hong!The two people\u2019s palms collided and a huge sound rang out, and it was as if a landslide suddenly crashed down from a mountain peak! Jiao Peng groaned as he flew horizontally outwards. The webbing between his fingers split open, and fresh blood sprinkled out as his palm continuously spasmed.If not for the string of mysterious symbols on his arms shining at that crucial moment, causing two vicious Flood Dragons to wrap around his arms, his fingers would have most certainly been horrifyingly fractured.Pu Tong!Jiao Peng flew outwards several tens of meters before dropping to the ground. He tumbled another few meters until he finally stopped and stabilized.Instantly, the entire scene was completely quiet; even a pin drop could be hear. Everyone stared blankly. No one had thought this type of result would occur. With just one exchange, Jiao Peng was blown back flying!\u201cAmazing divine strength!\u201d The elder from Heavenly Cloud Palace gasped in surprise.At the very least, in his age range, the little guy\u2019s corporeal body had long surpassed Jiao Peng and those other geniuses by an entire level. He could be praised as a heavenly gifted genius.Jiao Peng leapt to his feet and stood upright. His face was almost bleeding. This time he suffered a terrible tragedy and it felt as if he had just been slapped on the face. His power level began to rise.Boom!A muffled noise echoed through and the little guy kicked up that thousand jin cauldron with one foot and sent it flying towards Zishan Kun and Lei Mingyuan, as those two took advantage of their exchange to aim their bows towards those three hatchlings.The huge cauldron covered the sky!They were all stupefied; was this truly a four year old baby? He sent the huge thousand jin cauldron flying with one foot. Such a tyrannical strength, it really did not resemble his ordinary appearance as a white and tender baby.With a rumble, the copper cauldron flew over. Such deep ferocious power was truly terrifying.The geniuses in this age range could easily lift a cauldron, but to use it as a weapon to hack horizontally and smash vertically, no one dared to do such a thing.The two geniuses quickly dodged, as they were afraid of being hit. If they were merely rubbed by it, then their bones would definitely break and their tendons would snap!Kacha!Finally, Zishan Kun\u2019s precious bow was snapped as the copper cauldron ferociously collided with it. It was very sudden, and he was afraid that he couldn\u2019t dodge, so he used his bow to block as he moved. Nothing happened to him, but his bow was snapped on the spot.\u201cYou two come.\u201d The little guy stared at two people as he berated. He then looked towards Jiao Peng, pointing at three people and said \u201cYou three can come at me together!\u201dThe group of people were dumbstruck. Experts from the Purple Mountain clan, Lightning clan\u00a0and the Great\u00a0Floating Pond\u00a0were all flabbergasted. Those were their clan\u2019s geniuses. They came to a wild mountain village and needed to work together against a milk-feeding baby?If Jiao Peng, Zishan Kun and Lei Mingyuan were geniuses, then what would you consider this child who wasn\u2019t even four years old yet?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Being repeatedly suppressed irritated him, making it was simply unbearable.He was an untamable person and also a genius from a huge clan. His name was known in a vast circumference of over 50 thousand li. To be defeated in a mountain village, it was truly too shameful and humiliating.Things had already reached such a point, so Shi Hao did not want to talk any further and only wanted to battle.\u201cJiao Peng, are you okay? You were knocked away several times and now you\u2019re in rage from being humiliated?\u201d Zishan Kun strode over. Although he was taunting Jiao Peng, he had a cold glint in his eyes as he stared towards the little guy. His precious bow was destroyed, making him feel rather uncomfortable. He was prepared to take action at any time.\u201cYou want to fight us three by yourself? You overestimate your abilities!\u201d Lei Mingyuan stood at the side as he smiled coldly out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cJust because your body is strong, it doesn\u2019t mean anything. In this world, precious techniques are the strongest things. Without the backing of divine abilities and only relying on your corporeal strength, how far can you go?The little guy did not say anything and only stared at them. He then turned his head towards the group of experts and said towards the elderly man from Heavenly Cloud Palace, \u201cI request grandfather to bear witness and judge who is strong and who is weak.\u201dEveryone was amazed. This little kid was truly clever and saw who was the strongest amongst them. He spoke towards the elderly man holding the Snow Feather and spoke in such a way to fairly administer and judge the fight.Buzz!This time, it was the little guy who took initiative. He first charged towards Zishan Kun, who held dense enmity towards him and reached out his hand. His fingers shined like a crystal of divine jade.\u201cGood, let me try and have a taste of just how powerful your body is!\u201dHe was known as a genius since he was young. Zishan Kun was always proud and arrogant. He side-stepped back a few steps to dodge Shi Hao\u2019s sharp strike. As the strength in his opponent\u2019s palm nearly faded, he ferociously brandished his palm to counterattack.Although he wanted to measure how strong the little guy\u2019s flesh was, he wasn\u2019t reckless. Seeing Jiao Peng suffer such a tragedy, he decided to use cheap tricks while fighting.However, the little guy did not have a fighting style. Growing up in the desolate lands, he did not learn any proper killing styles. He killed ferocious beasts and vicious birds using the most primitive methods. As his strength was fading, he lowered his entire body and kicked his right leg forward like lightning. Like a scorpion arming its tail, his attack was fast and powerful.Zishan Kun was shocked. This type of fighting style would only be learned after they grew up a bit. Their seniors have always told them that a style only set them on a path, and that a true fight to the death would have a thousand variations; life and death was decided in an instant.He rapidly dodged as that attack almost struck his skull. It continued sweeping towards his chest, and Zishan Kun used all his strength to block the attack with his palm.Boom!Like a fierce rhinoceros colliding against a cliff, a rumbling noise loudly sounded, sending rocks and sand into the air as dust and smoke filled the skies.Zishan Kun\u2019s felt an acute pain within his palm, as if something was fractured. If not for the ring on his thumb shining and mitigating some of that terrifying force, his arm would have most likely snapped off.Even like so, he flew backwards. Having been hit into the air by a single kick from Shi Hao, he flew back horizontally over ten meters.\u00a0Plop,\u00a0he dropped to the ground. During this time, the little guy also flew out. However, it wasn\u2019t because he was retreating but rather because he was moving by his own will. He rushed towards Lei Mingyuan to once again violently strike with his fist.\u201cWow, this doll-like baby was actually this strong.\u201d Those twin sisters were both watching the fight. They had clear eyes, long eyelashes, and a spirited nature. Their identically beautiful faces warmed the heart and delighted the eyes.After seeing those two other geniuses ferociously beaten flying by this little child, Lei Mingyuan did not want to compete with just his body anymore. His eyes blazed brilliantly and a black lightning surged around his body. A symbol appeared in his palm as lightning interweaved and surged outwards.The air was filled with the sounds of popping and banging. Sparks flew in all directions, creating turbulent electricity. A thick streak of black lightning charged frighteningly towards Shi Hao.The little guy was not scared in the slightest. He shook his right arm lightly and symbols immediately flourished through his arms. Divine light filled his body, making him shine brilliantly like delicate gems all over.A loud\u00a0Boom\u00a0sounded, and the little guy wasn\u2019t obstructed in the slightest. His right leg swept across and kicked out a large millstone towards Lei Yuanming.Ka Cha.\u00a0Lei Mingyuan snapped it with one palm. At this moment, the little guy arrived in front of him. He soared into the sky and stamped his feet down from the air. After a large\u00a0Bang,\u00a0Lei Mingyuan flew out. Although he crossed his arms to block, he was still struck by the heavy blow.The little guy could exert a godly strength of 8000 jin with just his arms, and his legs were even stronger. Lei Mingyuan looked as if he had been struck by a bull. Blood spurted out of his mouth, and both his arms shined and trembled as if they broke.\u201cThose must be the weakening symbols discovered by Lei Hou. Otherwise, both his arms would have been broken!\u201d People were genuinely shocked.In such a short time span, the little guy struck those three geniuses one after the other and held the upper hand. The experts of the three clans had ugly expressions on their faces. This was too hard to believe. Such a small mountain village had this kind of world-shaking genius that could have actually been called a heavenly gifted genius.Right now, not only was Jiao Peng\u2019s anger filled to the brim, Zishan Kun and Lei Mingyuan\u2019s faces also turned red with embarrassment. Their eyes shined with a cold glint as this made them lose a lot of face. They were unexpectedly knocked away flying with one foot; this was truly an embarrassment and a disgrace.Weng!Jiao Peng\u2019s gaze was ice cold. After watching for a while, he decided to take action and activate his precious technique with the intention of killing the little guy.In the middle of his palm, an ancient symbol appeared. It dazzled the the air as its radiance was reflected in the sky.\u00a0Hong, a vicious aura filled the air and a grey-brown Flood Dragon took shape from within the symbol, charging towards the little guy.Shi Hao did not panic. He cut across the empty air with his right hand, causing silver splendor to sprinkle outwards. A disk-like moon emerged and multi-colored light reflected everywhere as it blocked in front of his body.The Flood Dragon was violent. Its water sacs were thick and thin, and its scales were dense as it brought with it an ancient power. It was as if it crossed over from ancient times to participate in this battle.Hong!The silver moon disk rotated in front of the little guy\u2019s body, and the essence energy between heaven and earth surged and accumulated into a vast ocean. As he rose from the middle of a vast ocean, he also grasped boundless divine power as he chopped towards the Flood Dragon.This was a confrontation of Precious Techniques. When the Flood Dragon collided with the Silver Moon, brilliant light flowed in all four directions and splashed outwards.This Flood Dragon danced across the Heaven and Earth as it raged up and down. One burning light after another surged out, snapping the trees and breaking the rocks within the vicinity.\u00a0Kacha kacha, the continuous sound of snaps and cracks sounded.With a bird\u2019s cry, the divine splendor of the Silver Moon flourished even more. A vicious bird flew out from the middle. Its image increased in size dramatically in just an instant, and like a cloud, it floated above the battlefield in the sky. Its violent killing aura shocked everyone.\u201cWhat, that is an Archaic Devil Bird! Is it a Heaven-Swallowing Sparrow or a Green Sky Peng? Such a powerful precious technique!\u201d The experts from the Golden Wolf Tribe, the Great Floating Pool and the other clans couldn\u2019t help but be amazed.Although Shi Hao only activated an incomplete technique, it still made other people aware of its terrifying aura. This was an extremely powerful precious technique.If this technique evolved towards completion just a bit further, it would not be a bit inferior to the oppressing divine abilities of the Purple Mountain, Thunder Clan, and the Great Floating Pool. This was an ancient precious technique coveted by all huge clans.Very quickly, everyone\u2019s gaze shifted towards those three hatchlings. Their eyes were blazing. If they had to guess, this precious technique definitely originated from those three mutated Green Scaled Eagles.\u201cAn ancestral inheritance occurred. The Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s strongest fragment appeared!\u201d A few people were keen on discovering where it originated from.Boom,\u00a0that huge devil bird, not knowing whether it\u2019s a Heaven Swallowing Sparrow or a Blue Sky Peng, dove down. With a pair of huge claws covered in drizzling mist, it grabbed the vicious Flood Dragon.With a\u00a0beng\u00a0sound,\u00a0it used its strength and completely tore it apart. That grey vicious Flood Dragon\u00a0dissipated into light, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.In the days after his baptism, the little guy\u2019s understanding and comprehension of the precious technique deepened, and that\u2019s how he rapidly increased the might of the precious technique to easily oppress Jiao Peng.At this moment, Zishan Kun, Lei Mingyuan also took action and attacked intensely.Hu\u2026.The Archaic Devil BIrd flapped its wings and instantly covered the earth and shrouded the sky. Violent gales erupted everywhere and the terrifying aura spread. It dove towards Zishan Kun while covered in a mist. It appeared even more frightening since its body was barely visible.The little guy went on the offensive. He used the Silver Moon to protect his body and ordered the Archaic Devil Bird to dive down and attack his enemies.Zishan Kun shouted loudly and his entire body shined. Purple mist soared to the sky and a purple sun flew out while rapidly enlarging. A Purple Flaming Unicorn stood in the middle with its head held high, steaming in raging flames.Hong!The Purple Flaming Unicorn was angry. It rushed towards the sky to meet the Archaic Devil Bird in a head-on collision. Brilliant splendor emitted from between those two. Like two star systems colliding into one another, all four directions illuminated in a boundless white light.With a wail, that Purple Flaming Unicorn trembled and retreated. The Archaic Devil Bird dove toward it at the same time.\u00a0Pu,\u00a0with one claw holding its head completely in place, it smashed it apart.Hong,\u00a0purple flames overflowed the heavens as the Flaming Unicorn fell and became essence energy. Rays of light were released as it disappeared between the heaven and earth.Zishan Kun trembled and with extreme speed, he used a precious technique to defend himself.The Archaic Devil Bird flapped its wings and transformed into a demonic cloud. It filled the vast empty skies and charged towards Lei Mingyuan.The sound of wind whistled and the little guy leapt 30 meters toward the retreating Jiao Peng. A silver moon suspended high in front of him as it shined down hundreds of thousands of rays of light.\u201cAh!\u201dJiao Peng shouted loudly. His expression was of pure dread. He could no longer protect himself. The little guy tread down from the air as the silver moon sprinkled its radiance when the bone text was utilized. With a\u00a0bang sound,\u00a0Shi Hao kicked his chin. He tumbled out several revolutions until both his mouth and nose spurted out blood.The little guy landed on the floor, and his eyes were clear. He grabbed a several hundred jin millstone beside him and swatted the top of Jiao Peng\u2019s head.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d Jiao Peng cried miserably. Although his body was strong, he was about to be struck by such a huge millstone. His face held a bitter and unendurable expression as he could hardly believe the situation.Pu,\u00a0he spouted out a mouthful of foaming blood and then spat out two broken teeth. His entire face was in pain as he let out his blood-curdling screams.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Otherwise, the people of the Great Floating Pond would definitely not take this matter lightly. Perhaps he might provoke a large tragedy in Stone Village.This was reality. To live in the middle of the desolate lands, apart from defending themselves from all kinds of desolate beasts, they sometimes had to lower their heads to prevent their clan from being exterminated.This was the first time Shi Hao thirsted for more power!\u201cTogether!\u201dLei Mingyuan lightly shouted and began his attack. Zishan Kun also charged forward once again.The little guy threw away Jiao Peng like throwing away a broken jar. \u00a0He used his precious technique and invited the other two to attack him. Rays of light burned brightly. Purple lightning emerged, and a vicious bird cried, starting the intense battle once more.Lei Mingyuan extended his ten fingers. In the middle of the glaring lightning, a vicious bird covered in black lightning flew out and attacked the little guy.Unfortunately, it was ineffective. Shi Hao activated his precious technique, and the Archaic Devil Bird opened its terrifyingly huge mouth. To everyone\u2019s surprise, it swallowed that lightning bird whole and the technique crumbled.Everyone who saw this was alarmed. What an incredibly powerful precious technique!Xiu!Suddenly, a cold light sped toward the back of the little guy\u2019s head as quick as lightning.Jiao Peng was very firm and decisive. He crawled up from the ground and did not accept Shi Hao\u2019s kindness. He activated his precious technique again and this time, the vicious Flood Dragon was transformed into a vicious arrow. He armed the arrow on his bow and aimed for a surprise attack. The light beams were shocking and the arrowhead was chilling.This made everyone in Stone Village cry out in fear as their faces paled.\u201cAi ya!\u201d The two young maidens from Heavenly Cloud Palace also cried out in alarm.The little guy felt something was off and suddenly turned his entire body. His eyes were clear and pure. With a shake of his arm,\u00a0flickering symbols appeared, and a second silver moon emerged. With one in each hand, he joined them together.\u00a0Weng,\u00a0the two silver moons combined into a spotless disk.The vicious Flood Dragon arrow shot through and he lightly rotated the silver and shiny disk. Suddenly,\u00a0kacha kacha\u00a0sounded,\u00a0and he ground that vicious arrow into nothing.Everyone exposed their shocked expressions. The Heavenly Cloud Palace\u2019s elder lightly sighed and said, \u201cSo amazing. So young yet able to refine and combine precious techniques. Simply a heavenly gifted genius!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time he praised the little guy. The other experts also had no choice but to keep silent.In fact, whether it was the Lightning Clan, Purple Mountain Clan or the Great Floating Pond, all of their main precious techniques had a huge reputation. Except, those three children did not fully utilize them, so they were defeated.Jiao Peng\u2019s expression paled. From the start until now, every time he fought this child, he was oppressed and never held the upper hand. It hit him really hard, and it was a huge blow to his self-confidence.\u201cIf you don\u2019t step down this time, you will take full responsibility of the consequence!\u201d Shi Hao said only this.Jiao Peng heard what was said and his face whitened. However, his eyes immediately shone with a frightening light. With a fierce expression, he charged forward once again.The three geniuses combined their attacks against the little guy. This place was currently filled with ear-splitting thunder rumbles, unicorn howls, and vicious Flood Dragon roars.The Archaic Devil Bird cried and beat both its wings. It covered the entire sky and casted a large shadow underneath. A vicious aura filled the air and made the people nervous and stifled.Its strength oppressed the Flame Unicorn, Thunder Bird and the Vicious Flood Dragon. Its vicious might was unrivaled and it ruthlessly suppressed them.The Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s killing intent overflowed into the heavens. That Flood Dragon was torn apart into three pieces and the Thunder Bird was swallowed whole. That Flame Unicorn was smashed apart by both its wings.Hong!Jiao Peng, Zishan Kun, and Lei Mingyuan were knocked away and sent flying. They all spouted out mouthfuls of blood as they tumbled through the ground while covered in smoke and dust.The experts were amazed. These were three geniuses that were unparalleled within a circumference of 50000 li. Even after combining their attacks, they were still shocked that they were defeated by a baby from a mountain village.This\u2026 was too shocking and hard to believe.This time, Jiao Peng, Zishan Kun and Lei Mingyuan were all angry and embarrassed at the same time. Normally, they would be known as geniuses. No matter where they went, they would be showered with praise. Right now, they lowered their head in shame and became tumbling piles of dust. This was hard to look at. Such a huge difference in strength made them want to go mad and loudly shout toward the sky.The little guy rushed forward and kicked Jiao Peng into a huge rock like a ball as soon as he came to his senses. Jiao Peng let out a wretched blood-curdling scream like he never yelled before.Zishan Kun and Lei Yuaning wanted to retreat a long time ago, but they failed. The little guy chased after them and similarly kicked them twice in their mouths and noses. They rolled all over the ground, bleeding in pain.Finally, the little guy charged past and lifted both of them up. He lined them up and beat them with a millstone that he grabbed.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dZishan kun and Lei Mingyuan were beaten until they cried. Although their bodies were strong, they were unable to withstand the torment of Shi Hao. They were limp, and their bodies were hurting all over.\u201cYou dare, if you treat me this way again, I\u2019ll massacre your Stone Village!\u201d Jiao Peng angrily rebuked. Seeing Shi Hao carrying a several hundred jin stone roller, he rushed towards him.Bang!The little guy did not even blink once and immediately crushed his face with the millstone.\u201cAo\u2026\u201d Jiao Peng let out a cry that barely resembled that of a human\u2019s. His face was crooked and his nose was broken. This time, every teeth in his mouth broke from being smashed by that millstone.Not only himself, even the people watching felt as if they were hurt. The face of the middle aged man, Jiao Cang, from the Great Floating Pond twitched. He took a step forward and began to charge with great killing intent!\u201cJunior brother Jiao Cang, what are you trying to do? Didn\u2019t you say earlier that these children were just angry at each other and they were to have a little fight with each other? The adults do not need to participate.\u201d The elder from the Heavenly Cloud Palace said.\u201cThat\u2019s right, just a few kids having a little fight with each other. Why get angry over it.\u201d The leader of the Golden Wolf Tribe reconciled.This made others flabbergasted. Many people on this stage wanted to obtain the precious bones of the Suan Ni and looked at Stone Village unfavorably. The leader of the Golden Wolf Tribe was also very proactive. Why did he suddenly change his mind?\u201cChild, your heavenly gift is amazingly rare and you amazed everyone here. However, continuing to live on in this desolate land, you would eventually be left behind. Our Golden Wolf Tribe is looking for a disciple and we don\u2019t know whether or not you wish to join? When the time comes, I\u2019ll teach you the strongest Bone Texts and pass on our most powerful precious technique to you,\u201d said the head of the Golden Wolf Tribe.Many people were startled and then lightly cursed. So cunning\u2026 like this, he would obtain a genius and would also very peacefully be able to pocket the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones for himself.\u201cLittle guy come to our Heavenly Cloud Temple. We\u2019ll bring you to look at the Sea of Snow and drink the most delicious milk.\u201d The two young maidens opened their mouth as little Shi Hao blinked.\u201cI love drinking milk.\u201d The little guy blinked his large eyes as he said.Having heard that, the leader of the Golden Wolf Tribe frowned. This kid is doing this on purpose and actually wanted to refuse them right? Although he looked simple-minded, his choice certainly wasn\u2019t bad.\u201cChild, a master is very important. You must certainly make the correct choice of inheritance. We can control lightning and are we are able to turn into the embodiment of divine thunder. Would you be willing to consider joining us?\u201d \u00a0Even the old servant from the Lightning Clan started to talk. Even though their genius was already stepped all over, he still tried to persuade him.Everyone changed their expressions. Being able to take such an apprentice, take away the Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s descendants, and also obtain the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones was simply too great of a fortune. Therefore, the other powers started to persuade as well.\u201cLittle brother needs to leave these great desolate lands, you can\u2019t stuff yourself within the mountains your entire life. The outside world is so amazing and our clan\u2019s strong precious techniques will allow you to step into the heavens.\u201d\u201cOur clan has a mythical fire precious technique. If you master it, you can melt the mountains into a sea of fire and burn all your enemies within this world. Child, you should join our clan and maybe someday, you can inherit from our ancient god \u2014 Fire God\u2019s Will.\u2026Not everyone was like this. Some people secretly sneered and said \u201cEveryone, stop being so artificial just for the sake of obtaining the precious bones of the Suan Ni. Why should we take away a child? Sooner or later, we will just kill him to get rid of an annoyance.The little guy stopped a long time ago. The other three children were helped up and brought back by their clansmen. They were badly battered and bloodstained, and they were angry and embarrassed as they lost face for their family.The expert from the Great Floating Pool sneered and said \u201cWhy be so pretentious. Our Great Floating Pool just want to obtain the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones. This village certainly cannot hide it forever.\u201cEn\u2026 indeed. A Suan Ni\u2019s bones certainly can\u2019t be guarded by a village. If we left it to them, their village would be exterminated. We could discuss how to handle this situation.\u201cCorrect, let it be so. Also, three hatchlings of a Devil Bird is not something a small village can have. They should also be handed over.\u201d\u2026Many experts also joined him. They all completely ignored the people of Stone Village and did not ask for their permissions at all. Everything would be handled by the experts here to see who would get what.Everyone from Stone Village became furious after hearing this. This was simply too much. Just because they were weak, they were put into a position like this? They did not give them a single greeting or ask a single question. It was utter contempt.\u201cUncles, the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bone belong to us. We paid the price for them with our lives and blood. Da Peng, Xiao Qing, and Zi Yun are also my partners.\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes were clear and his voice was crisp. He carefully picked his words and put the entire place into a state of silence.The three hatchlings leaned against his sides. Their eyes flashed intelligently. They rubbed their heads against his arms to show their intimacy.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be exterminated, you should hand them over. Whether it\u2019s those three birds or the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones, they are not things that you can have,\u201d said an expert\u00a0from a large clan.\u201cYours? After a while, Stone Village would cease to exist and these objects would have no owners!\u201d Turning around slowly, the bloodstained Jiao Peng angrily said after wiping his away his blood stains.\u201cYou\u2026 are such bullies!\u201d The nasally kid sobbed. He understood the situation in front of his eyes as Stone Village could not keep these people away.A vicious aura emerged from Jiao Peng\u2019s body. He looked towards the flying Flood Dragon that was spiraling in the air and said, \u201cUncle Jiao, teach those wild children, especially that child with milk on the corner of his mouth. Grab his head, leave him with just one breath, and bring him to me.\u201dAoo\u2026A muffled roar echoed. That flying Flood Dragon exposed his head from the sky and stared towards the children at the village entrance. Its gaze was awe-inspiring and its killing intent filled the air.\u201cYou guys are bullying us way too much!\u201d Shi Dazhuang trembled angrily.\u201cSo what if we\u2019re bullying you. If you dare to talk back, we\u2019ll exterminate your village right away.\u201d Jiao Peng leapt up and sat on the back of the flying Flood Dragon as he stared down with his ice-cold expression toward the little guy.The middle-aged expert from Great Floating Pool, Jiao Cang did not stop him. With his ice-cold face he said \u201cHand over the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones and offer us your three bird. Otherwise, this village might not exist for much longer.\u201dThis was a mountain village. Their customs were simple, but their village certainly did not lack a bloody nature. Shi Linghu and several others were angry and said \u201cWe\u2019d rather be broken jade than a complete roof tile. If you\u2019re truly forcing us into a bloody battle, then we\u2019ll fight down to our last drop of blood.They knew that even if they handed over the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones, these experts would most likely exterminate them anyway. After all, the things they were doing were truly disgraceful, so no one wanted to give away anything.\u201cDoes your village really want to be massacred?\u201d The Great Floating Pool\u2019s expert Jiao Cang coldly said.\u201cUncle Jiao, start right away. Shred these people for me!\u201d Jiao Peng sat on top and pointed toward where the little guy was.\u201cWillow Deity, I know that you can certainly hear my words. We also know that you can protect us. Please guard this place,\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes were clear as he lightly spoke towards the scorched willow tree.\u201cYou truly want to pretend it\u2019s a Deity Spirit? Uncle Jiao, massacre this place for me and also snap that willow branch of their Guardian Spirit and give it to me!\u201dJiao Peng shouted without any restraint.Jiao Cang did not speak a word as he coldly watched over everything.Hou\u2026.The flying Flood Dragon started to move. Its huge body swooped down towards the Stone Village as it brought a violent gale with it.\u201cGrandpa Chief, stop them quick!\u201d The two identical young maidens were anxious and pleaded their own grandfather to help Stone Village.\u201cDon\u2019t rush!\u201d The elder from Heavenly Cloud Palace said lightly. Right now his heart was beating quickly and the hair on his back stood straight.Chi!Suddenly, a bright ray of light rushed forward. A dark green willow branch, as if it was sculpted out of divine jade, sparkling all over and emitted resplendent multicolored light \u00a0as it pierced the sky.That flying Flood Dragon dove down with its mouth wide open. It intended to massacre Stone Village, however, it suddenly widened its eyes. It was startled to its limit and let out a terrifying screech.Aooo\u2026.Soon after, its cries were immediately silenced. A dark green willow branch, like a neat divine chain blazing in green multicolored light, pierced through its body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looked incomparably soft, but when it pierced over, it seemed as tough as divine steel.\u00a0Pu,\u00a0that flying Flood Dragon was nailed in the air, and its blood trickled down the other-worldly and mysterious tender branch.The Flood Dragon could no longer utter another sound, and every scale on its body immediately lost all of its former luster. Its fear reached the extreme and it was quickly beginning to lose signs of life as it lightly shivered all over.\u201cWhat happened? Uncle Jiao!\u201d Jiao Peng shouted from the back of the vicious Flood Dragon in dread.This was a terrifying scene. The Flood Dragon was as thick as a water tank, and it stretched several tens of meters long. It was covered densely in scales, and on its back were a pair of wings. It was majestic and ferocious, however, it was still nailed in the air by the strange, tender branch, and was unable to move an inch.\u201cHow can this be?!\u201d The experts cried out in alarm.Was this considered a Guardian Spirit of a mountain village? How could it be this dreadful? With just a single strike, it was able to pierce the body of such a powerful vicious beast.\u201cQuickly, save it!\u201d Shouted Jiao Cang, the middle aged man from the Great Floating Pool.Ten shadows emerged from within the forest, their palms flickering with symbols. Suddenly, light beams shot toward the sky, covering the entire village. They wanted to kill the willow tree.The Lightning clan, Purple Mountain Clan and the Golden Wolf Tribe all shivered within their hearts. Great Floating Pool seemed to only have a few people on the surface but a group of people secretly followed. They previously already made ample preparations.However, everything was too late. In just a split second, the thick flying Flood Dragon in midair had already lost its gaze in its two eyes. Its dazzling scales seemed to have aged ten thousand years, and were beginning to split apart. Its body began to rapidly age and disintegrated as it fell down.This unforeseen event was too frightening. How could such a terrifying and mighty Flood Dragon turn to dust just like that as if it died of old age?Jiao Peng became terrified and fell onto the ground. He was really frightened. How powerful was this Guardian Spirit? He tumbled outwards and no longer held a shred of haughtiness. His face was deathly white as he trembled all over.The tender green branch had a drop of grey liquid on it, and the grey drop held an exuberant amount of life force as it lightly rolled around. This was extracted from within the flying Flood Dragon, and was absorbed by the branch.From the Flood Dragon being penetrated to splitting into pieces and dropping to the ground, it was all completed within a split second.Those ten experts who emerged from within the forest filled the skies with dancing rays of light and flickering symbols. Ancient and vicious birds took shape, and they all curled up in their dazzling lights as they attacked the scorched black willow tree.Xiu!The willow branch extended and transformed into a dark green chain. It quickly drew a beautiful, sparkling arc in the middle of the sky. However, the terrifying aftermath sent fear into everyone\u2019s hearts.Pu.The willow branch streaked past and snapped an expert in half along the waist. It looked feeble, but it was undoubtedly a divine knife. It directly cut that individual in half as his blood gushed everywhere.\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d Everyone was stunned.That was just the beginning. The experts who rushed forward began to enshroud the surroundings in sparkling light.The willow branch swayed with the wind as its multi-colored green light blossomed. It streaked across the sky like a divine chain and hacked as if it was an immortal sword. One after another, the experts were either snapped into two pieces, or cut into two parts.The attacks were absolutely dreadful. It was clearly just a willow branch, yet it streaked across the sky like the sharpest of swords, cutting everything in its path.Pu, Pu\u2026.Blood blossomed and splashed everywhere. As the willow branch brandished quickly in the air, bodies dropped to the ground, and they were either split in half or broken. Blood bloomed like flowers, one after another.The sunset glow was cast on the horizon. It dyed the entire village in a golden splendor. During this sunset, on top of a scorched black willow, a willow branch swayed lusciously. However, the floor was filled with the bodies of the bloodstained dead. This unforgettable scene was permanently painted within every expert\u2019s head.In this way, all the experts from the Great Floating Pool was killed in an instant without any suspense. All of the onlooking experts were cold all over from fear.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dJiao Peng let out a blood-curdling screech. He was frightened. A few carcasses landed on top of him as their blood sprayed all over his body and face. He was crying as he crawled and tumbled in an effort to escape.Jiao Cang\u2019s face paled. He had already lost all color from his face a long time ago. His entire body was covered in cold sweat, and this insurmountable fear lingered within his mind.What a powerful Guardian Spirit!!All the calm and composed experts from before all became dumbstruck. Just a few moments ago, they were looking at the people of Stone Village with utter contempt. They were discussing how to seize the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones and take those three birds for themselves. Now, each and every one of them were staring in horror.Shi Feijiao and a group of able-bodied villagers, as well as the children, women, and elders were all at a loss for words. They stared stupidly at everything in disbelief.Absolutely mind-blowing. A single willow branch was able to pierce the heavens and the earth, killing and beheading all those experts; it made people shiver.For the last ten years, the willow tree never made any attempts to communicate with the village or show any signs of abnormal behavior. Now, however, it brought about such a shocking scene, giving everyone a surreal feeling.Perhaps, only the Chief who isolated himself and the few people who had prior knowledge of this were not shocked. This was because over ten years ago, during that flooding thunderstorm, they saw an even more terrifying scene.\u201cWa\u2026\u201d Jiao Peng finally crawled out of the pile of dead bodies and jumped towards Jiao Cang\u2019s side. He held his legs as he cried and shouted in fear.Only now was this peace disturbed. Those experts in shock gradually came back to their senses. They held reverence, yet they also held fear and did not dare face that willow tree.Jiao Cang was unwilling to give up, yet he was the one with the most fear. He stood at the village entrance and said \u201cMighty Guardian Spirit, please excuse my ignorant and offensive behavior.\u201dAs his voice just sounded, a gust of wind swept past. The willow branch swayed in the air as it brought about mists and vapors. It gradually descended downwards.\u00a0With a pu sound,\u00a0that willow branch pierced his right arm.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dA miserable shriek echoed through the air. No matter how hard Jiao Cang struggled, it was useless. The divine light within his body rapidly vanished. His right arm was being absorbed, and then it began to crack.\u00a0Pu,\u00a0it snapped off like rotten wood as it fell towards the floor.Jiao Peng howled miserably. He was right underneath Jiao Cang, and was holding his legs as this dry and cracked arm smashed onto him. He looked up and saw a sparkling, tender branch. He immediately rolled his eyes back in fright and passed out.Jiao Cang smiled bitterly. Not only did he lose an arm, he also lost half of his cultivation. He was teetering on the verge of collapse and was incomparably bitter in his heart. Just a moment ago, he was still thinking highly of himself as he looked down at the villagers. He previously looked down on all of them with disdain, but it all changed in a flash. Never would he have thought that he could be crippled so easily, turning into a powerless man.The other two youths that were slightly older from The Great Floating Pool walked forward to support Jiao Cang. The hands and hearts of these two geniuses were trembling. Everything they just saw would be forever imprinted within their hearts and would be difficult to forget within their entire lives.All the experts kept quiet in fear. Their hearts were still in terror. This Guardian Spirit was too frightening, as it sent a shiver down everyone\u2019s spines.Everyone from the Golden Wolf Tribe, Lightning Clan, and Purple Mountain were all intimidated. They were just talking about how to punish Stone Village a moment ago to seize the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones for themselves, but after this spectacle, they could only stand still in fright.Everyone was absolutely regretful. If they had known that this willow tree was this terrifying, even if they were demanded to hand over their treasured artifact, they wouldn\u2019t say anything against it.\u201cWei\u2026\u00a0didn\u2019t you guys want to steal our treasures? Just try it.\u201d The group of children were acting extremely indignant. After their mood recovered, they all started to rile up.\u201cGolden Wolf Tribe, Great Floating Pool, Lightning Clan and Purple Mountain Clan, weren\u2019t you all acting high and mighty just now,\u00a0completely\u00a0looking down on us with disdain? How come you\u2019re all pale now?\u201d Er Meng said as he stared blankly.\u201cFurthermore, didn\u2019t several experts just now say that you\u2019d massacre our village?\u201d The nasally kid clenched his fists as he brought up what they just talked about, rubbing salt on their wounds.The group of experts heard everything, and they all quivered; their heads were about to explode. \u00a0They looked towards that willow tree, afraid that it will begin to display its divine might once again.\u201cJunior brother, we were just joking. None of it was real, don\u2019t hold it within your hearts.\u201dThe group of experts shivered with cold sweat. They were all incredibly high and mighty, and they would never have cared about these villagers normally. They would be respected wherever they went, so why would they act differently in this kind of mountain village? However now, they had to summon up the courage and apologize to these villagers.\u201cElder brothers, can you overlook our mistakes this time. You would be rewarded if you let us go.\u201d The leader of the Golden Wolf Tribe said as he looked towards Shi Linghu\u2019s group.Chi!A streak of multi-colored green light flashed past. The willow tree was on the move. That branch rapidly descended and pierced his shoulders. Half of the blood on his body dried up and an arm shriveled up and cracked as it dropped to the ground. Half of his body was crippled just like Jiao Cang.Afterwards, the willow branch quickly moved like a divine spear. It penetrated seven to eight experts in succession. These were people that either threatened or wanted to massacre Stone Village. Now, a large part of their strength and life force was absorbed by the willow branch.\u201cYou guys leave.\u201d Shi Linghu said.The group of experts trembled. This willow tree was too terrifying. It was impossible for them to deal with it unless they begged their clan heads to personally come. Otherwise, the experts here would simply be seeking death.The group rushed out of Stone Village. The Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s Leader\u00a0and the\u00a0Great Floating Pool\u2019s Cang Jiao held a grieved smile on their faces. Zishan Hou\u2019s uncle, Thunder Clan\u2019s elder servant were speechless. This time they were met with an absolute tragedy.Only the people from Heavenly Cloud Palace were unperturbed because they had absolutely no losses. The elder who lead those two pretty young maidens squinted his eyes and didn\u2019t say much. The two young maidens blinked their large round eyes and looked towards Stone Village. They wanted to talk so much more, but they were stopped.The sunset glow had disappeared long ago and the sky began to darken. Looking from afar, the willow tree from Stone Village was emitting hazy haloes of light, enshrouding the entire village.\u201cOur population is over ten million and we hold vast amounts of territory. It treated us like this, does it not fear that a great catastrophe might befall it?\u201d From a distance of over one li away, a few people were extremely angry.\u201cWe have to report this to our clan head and beg for him to come personally. Apart from the other stuff, the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones and this Guardian Spirit is an opportunity that we can\u2019t miss!\u201d A few people were in complete anger.However, as soon as they spoke, although they were so far away, the Guardian Spirit also responded. A lush green willow branch shrouded in multi-colored light extended out over one li away as it thrashed across.Pu, Pu\u2026.The angry people were immediately cut in half, as if they were split by the sharpest demonic knife. Their upper and lower bodies were completely separated and blood began to gush out.All of the clan leaders were already wounded. The old servant from Lightning Clan\u00a0and\u00a0Zishan Hou\u2019s uncle both lost an arm as a warning.All the experts\u2019 heads became numb and they didn\u2019t dare utter another word as they disappeared into the night. They held their shining precious artifacts, stuck close to the ground and charged into the heart of the ancient forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019ll see you another day.\u201dUnder the night scene, a five to six meter long Snow Feather radiated a pure and holy white splendor, and a few figures stood on top of it. Those two fairy-like sisters were waving their delicate little hands. They were identical in appearance and their skin shined like gems. Their large eyes were spirited as they bid their farewells toward Stone Village.The shining Snow Feather levitated three inches off the ground and quickly disappeared into the distant forest. They were the last departing group, and the sole group that left safe and sound.\u201cGood bye sisters. If you return, don\u2019t forget to bring some sweet beast milk from the Snow-Horned Leopard and Ancient Frozen Elephant\u2026.\u201d The little guy exhorted in his loud voice.Suddenly, laughter arose from within Stone Village. A group of children heckled and shouted \u201cThe four year-old sparrow chasing little Hao Hao who can\u2019t stop drinking milk.\u201dA large crisis was averted. Everyone\u2019s mood began to relax and began to laugh rowdily. The little guy\u2019s eyes were clear and his face was flushed red. He explained in a tiny voice \u201cI just wanted to have a little taste of the Snow-Horned Leopard\u2019s milk. I heard it was quite unusual. You guys don\u2019t laugh. I don\u2019t really want to actually drink it.\u201dHaha\u2026Shi Feijiao and the others walked forward and rubbed the little guy\u2019s hair and pinched his apple-like face. They all thought it was quite amusing.Stone Village began to calm down again and the villagers\u2019 expressions gradually became serious. They held all kinds of offerings and stood in front of the willow tree, earnestly offering their gifts. Everybody was praying piously, and it resonated with the heavens and earths as strange powers began to arise.Everyone was startled, especially the few elders. They heard that when the first natives offered sacrifices to their gods, all kinds of strange and mysterious powers would arise.Never would they have thought that their pious ceremony today would also have such mysterious developments. Although it was quite weak, everyone still felt it. Moreover, the black medicine cauldron they inherited from their ancestors started shaking as well. The sun, moon, mountains, rivers, and even the first natives engraved on the cauldron became clear as they all began to flow with light.The only unfortunate fact was that they did not know how to utilize this mysterious power.\u201cThe power from sacrificial ceremonies do exist, and they were incredible. If an entire country offers the sky to them, then what kind of power would be produced?\u201d A few elder\u2019s minds began to tighten and did not dare to think any further.This ceremony continued on for quite a while before it finished.The night was deep and the sky was dark. One lofty and majestic mountain peak after another towered above everything. All kinds of different roars echoed from within the ancient mountain ranges, shaking people\u2019s souls.Within the dark depths of the mountains, there was only one tranquil piece of land. From afar, one could only see a scorched black willow tree that only had one sparkling and tender branch. It emitted haloes of light, covering all of Stone Village and isolating it from the outside world. This piece of peaceful and tranquil area became the only pure land within the mountain range.Lightning Clan, Purple Mountain Clan, the Great Floating pool and the Golden Wolf Tribe utilized the entire night, and they were in such a hurry that they didn\u2019t make a stop even within Little Lonely Mountain Town. They were truly terrified. That willow tree was too mysterious, and made their hearts trembled with incomparable fear.At this very moment, they only wanted to quickly return and leave this demonic ancient mountain range in fear of encountering another disaster.The Scaled Horses\u2019 galloping was incredibly fast, especially the mutated one \u2014 the Unicorn. Their entire bodies were covered in dense glistening scales, and a single horn sat on top of their head. They were able to travel ten thousand li in a day.The Golden Wolf Tribe was over forty thousand li away from the endless mountain range. These people needed to rest. They had been escaping with all of their might for four days, and the unicorns as well as the people all dropped to the ground in fatigue.At the end of the horizon, buildings started to come into view. The center of the tribe was covered by a huge golden canopy, and it was embroidered with a huge, majestic and fierce wolf head.Pu tong.Just before arriving in front of the golden canopy, the few people atop the Unicorn rolled down. The middle-aged man with one of his arms broken looked pale and immediately passed out.\u201cBa Tu, what happened to you guys?\u201dIn the middle of the canopy embroidered with the golden wolf head, a tall and elderly man walked out. Strands of golden light flashed whenever he blinked, terrifying one\u2019s soul. He held the broken armed man and a symbol emerged from within his palm. Multi-colored light shot out and entered his body.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d The cripple middle-aged man looked as if he just woke up from a nightmare and shouted, \u201cClan head, you must avenge me!\u201d\u201cSpeak, what happened!\u201d\u201cWe entered a weird village and discovered the precious bone of a Suan Ni\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere was a thunder-stricken willow tree, and you people weren\u2019t able to resist at all? Many people were cut in half or pierced dead?!\u201d After the Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s old clan head heard everything, he couldn\u2019t help but feel his emotions stirring.From his gut feeling, he knew that the Guardian Spirit must have been extremely powerful. It was certainly nothing a mountain village could possibly possessed, and it definitely wasn\u2019t any inferior to their tribe\u2019s Guardian Spirit that overlooked ten million people.\u201cClan head, there are also some Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s descendants there, as well as the Suan Ni\u2019s most precious imprints. We cannot miss this opportunity.\u201d The other people spoke out as well and begged the clan head with all their might.After contemplating for a long while, the lofty old clan head whose eyes shined in dim gold nodded. Two golden flashes of lightning shot out from his eyes as he said, \u201cAn incredibly powerful Guardian Spirit appeared, so we must take a look no matter what. As extra precautions, I\u2019ll plead our Wolf God to follow us on this journey.Everyone\u2019s hearts trembled and then they exposed a cheerful expression. The clan head planned to plead their powerful Guardian Spirit for help, meaning that they no longer had anything to fear. That golden life form was truly terrifying, and it was revered by every single person within this tribe.Wu wu\u2026\u00a0Not long after, a golden whirlwind rapidly approached this huge field.Similar affairs also went down within the other large tribes.This was a vast and boundless lake as dark blue as the ocean. Jiao Cang and the other returned and entered within a holy island. They reported everything and instilled raged within the tribe. They pleaded their Ancient Barbaric Flood Dragon to appear, and as a result, the entire lake shook with white tsunamis that reached the skies.Within another vast and aristocratic tribe, the population reached ten million. Huge cities covered the lands one after the other, and they were extremely prosperous.In the middle of a grand and dignified ancient city, its black city walls rolled with a never-ending metallic sheen. The grand steel wall was situated within this flat plain, and it gave a feeling of oppression to all who laid their eyes upon it.\u201cA powerful Guardian Spirit\u2026\u201d Within a palace at the center of the capital, an awe-inspiring voice sounded.A round sun illuminated the entire palace hall. Sitting within the palace hall was a supreme expert. He was vaguely visible as a purple light blazed around him. His aura was like the ocean, exerting pressure on every expert within the palace hall, forcing all of those before him to lower their heads.That day, within a circumference of fifty thousand li, all the huge clan were shaken one after the other. As news regarding a powerful Guardian Spirit appeared, namely the thunder-stricken willow tree, it swept across the entire region like a great wave.News of the mountain treasure within the desolate mountains, the appearance of the precious bones of a Suan Ni within Stone Village, and the mysterious Guardian Spirit shook all the experts\u2019 hearts. All of the tribes\u2019 strongest experts were unable to sit around any longer.\u201cWe haven\u2019t moved in so many years. I think it\u2019s about time to take a look to see what kind of secrets that place holds!\u201dAfter several days, Little Lonely Mountain Town\u2019s peace was no longer peaceful. Some people saw the huge clan\u2019s lords personally come visit these lands, and all the powerful individuals who came in search of the mountain treasure were amazed.Kacha.Lightning interweaved as the head of the Lightning Clan stood beside a mountain wall. Huge flashes of lightning interweaved around his entire body as he easily hacked off half of the mountain cliff. It was a truly a sight to behold.\u201cSo strange. Ordinary people are unable to notice anything, but the more powerful the individual who gazes upon that direction, the faster their heart would beat. This willow tree truly isn\u2019t simple.\u201d The Lightning Clan head did not act rashly. His voice was like rolling thunder, and it shook the forest around him. All the ancient beasts quickly left the vicinity.After four hours, water vapors drifted around the area above the ancient forest\u2019s rivers. A low muffled roar could be heard, and it sounded as if a vicious Flood Dragon descended into the world. All of a sudden, mist and fog rushed towards the heavens as a silhouette emerged.In the middle of the mist, its figure was very indistinct. Only a pair of bright and fiery eyes could be seen. It penetrated the mist, and its appearance was soul-crushing. From a distance, it overlooked Stone Village and lightly said \u201cIs it this the Guardian Spirit that killed many of our clan\u2019s experts?\u201dAfter two days, a golden whirlwind passed through the ancient forest, terrifying many of the native vicious birds and fierce beasts into fleeing. The region was suddenly put in a deathly silence.A tall and dignified elder stood atop high ground and gazed toward Stone Village as he said to himself \u201cAn encounter with a lightning strike, and was still able to gain rebirth from its destruction. This willow must be truly terrifying!\u201dA golden Wolf God stood beside him. It wasn\u2019t tall and only five meters long, and was far from the size of other wolves within the mountains. However, it was discharging a terrifying aura. Its body and its eyes flashed in gold. Symbols were vaguely visible, and it was extremely terrifying.Their arrival wasn\u2019t slow, after all, they were the strongest experts within their respective tribes. They lingered around outside of Stone Village as they carefully surveyed the area in preparation for the great storm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some of them were here for Stone Village\u2019s Guardian Spirit, while others wanted to investigate the mountain treasure. They came quickly and in bunches, so Little Lonely Mountain Town was packed with people.The head of each clan did not act blindly without thinking. They all felt that this willow tree was extremely mysterious, and held a deep and immeasurable feeling.During these past few days, quite a few experts entered the depths of the mountain range. They wanted to see just what kind of divine object was worth fighting over for more than two years non-stop by these Archaic Descendants.The group of experts made up of individuals from different tribes combined to form an incredibly powerful army. They broke through the outer region, massacring all the fierce beasts in their way before entering the heart of the mountains.\u201cWhat kind of treasure do you think it is? To be able to hide for over two years without being found, could it possibly be a living creature?\u201d\u201cWu, perhaps it could be a holy medicine that\u2019s capable of flight.\u201dThe group was chatting amongst themselves, but they didn\u2019t neglect to make some preparations. They set out towards the mountains and each of them had some sort of expectation. If they couldn\u2019t obtain the treasure, then even obtaining some sort of legendary medicine would make this trip worthwhile.Of course, if they were to see for themselves the carcasses of Archaic Descendants who fought to their deaths, their hearts would be much more anxious. Without a doubt, each and every one of those creatures was a priceless treasure.Ao\u2026.Suddenly, a dull roar echoed from within the heart of the ancient mountain range, shaking the entire mountain. Huge rocks tumbled down and crushed the towering trees. It was as if the mountain exploded.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even enter that deeply yet, how can there be such a terrifying roar?\u201d Everyone was startled.Violent winds whistled past, swaying the ancient trees. A strong odor assaulted everyone\u2019s noses from within the forest, making them all feel disgusted. At the same time, a wave of frightening and fiendish aura assaulted them.\u201cNot good, the vicious beasts are moving about. Quickly get into the defensive formation!\u201dA Golden-Furred Bear rushed out while running upright. It was over ten meters tall, and a large horn stuck out between its brows as it rapidly arrived.Pu!Although its body was huge, it wasn\u2019t clumsy at all. Its speed was incredibly fast as it arrived. It slammed a palm into the ground before anyone was able to react. One unlucky person was directly squashed by the fan-like bear paw into a pile of meat.Chi.One of the experts activated his precious technique and attacked the single-horned Golden-Furred Bear. Bone Text spread out and flames blazed downwards toward the bear. However, this bear was not at all interested in fighting with them. It leapt up over twenty meters before disappearing far away in a flash.\u201cNot good, quickly run away! It\u2019s a beast flood!\u201dEveryone cried out in alarm. That bear was incredibly powerful and ran at the forefront. Behind it was a huge horde of other vicious beasts that flooded over like a vast expanse of darkness.Their hearts and bladders began to tremble; no wonder there was such a strong odor that previously assailed their nostrils. Frantic winds whistled past, and an enormous group \u00a0\u00a0of vicious beasts advanced.The ground was shaking, and many ancient trees were broken apart. Groups of huge beasts ran away violently, flattening the mountain ground. They ran from within the heart of the mountains in tight groups, and all of them were incredibly powerful.\u201cMotherf*cker\u2026 what happened? Why are there so many vicious beasts?!\u201d Everyone ran without the slightest hesitation. Within such a large beast flood, even the clan lords would find it to escape; no one dared to face this head on.Ao\u2026.Another thunderous roar echoed from within the depths of the mountains. Rubble flew into the sky and mountain peaks began to vibrate. Huge mountain rocks incessantly tumble down. An extremely terrifying situation was occurring.\u201cHeavens\u2026 an Archaic Descendant! That\u2019s a Devil Ape!\u201dEveryone turned around and shockingly discovered that a black ape king appeared. It was shrouded in a black mist that overflowed into the heavens, making him look like an unrivalled demon king. It stood upright in the sky and flapped its two large demonic wings as it looked down on everything. It was the Ape King that was driving away this group of beasts.What shocked people even more was that this tyrannical Archaic Descendant had one of its arms snapped off, and it had only one arm left. Its eyes revealed a vicious light as it stared at this place.The group of experts escaped as fast as they could, yet they were still discovered in the end. The Demonic Ape flapped both its wings and with a flash of black lightning, it stirred up a violent gale. Rubble began to tumble as it swooped down from the sky.The person running at the head of the group suddenly stopped dead in his tracks. His eyes lost all expression as blood began rushing out of his head. His skull flew away from his body, and that Demonic Ape opened its mouth to directly suck out all the brain tissue within his head.It did not stop there. Its body suddenly flashed in front of another person like black lightning. It was a speed that no one could react to.Pa.With a light flick of its fingers, another head flew off. It opened its mouth to suck the brain from within the skull, and it licked its scarlet lips before finally letting go.In the face of death, that person who had his brain emptied released a miserable howl that stopped spontaneously due to all of this happening way too quickly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dEveryone was in absolute horror, and couldn\u2019t help but scream for their lives. Their heads became numb with fright, and none of them could have ever imagined that they would meet an Archaic Descendent as soon as they entered the depths of the mountains. It was an enemy they absolutely could not attempt to fight with, and the only option was to run for their lives.However, this struggle was obviously in futile. The Demonic Ape began to flash about, leaving the place in a wretched state. Heads flew off of people\u2019s bodies non-stop as it basked in the pleasure of this delicacy.Ultimately, not a single person was left alive. Each and every one of these experts lost their lives in that place.If the people of Stone Village were here, they would recognize the creature right away. This was the Archaic descendant that fought against the Suan Ni back then, however now, it was even more ferocious.The beast flood was astonishing as it destroyed huge portions of the forest. They converged into a great tsunami and rushed out of the mountains like a tempest. Not only were the villages within the vicinity nervous, even the experts who came from far away were apprehensive. They thought that something definitely happened within the depths of the mountains for so many beasts to be scared like this.From afar, a large black shadow emerged. It looked as if it was covering the entire mountain range, and countless vicious birds escaped from the mountains at their utmost speeds.\u201cWu, what a terrifying beast flood. Originally, I thought this desolate and harsh land lacked spiritual essence, and it was improbable that an extraordinary creature would appear. I never could have thought there could be so many vicious creatures!\u201d Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s clan head stood atop a mountain rock as he overlooked the beast flood. His brows were locked. A Golden Wolf Deity stood beside him on the mountain summit all high and mighty as they stared toward the distance.\u201cYi, It\u2019s an Archaic Descendant that\u2019s driving away this group of beasts\u2026.\u201d The Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s clan chief exposed a shocked expression and said to himself, \u201cSuch a powerful descendant, it seems like it\u2019s taking orders from something else?\u201dAfter he came to this conclusion, he was suddenly shocked. That was an Archaic Descendant! No one within a large distance from here could be its match, yet currently, it was under the bidding of another.He understood vaguely that since the mountain depths were being forcefully evacuated, the mountain treasure must be coming into existence!At the same time, the Lightning Clan and the Great Floating Pool\u2019s most powerful individuals understood as well. They were the strongest within their respective clans, and although they controlled enormous tribes within their lands, currently, they could only let out a sigh. They knew that it was impossible for them to claim the mountain treasure, as they lacked the strength to seize it.After four hours, the beast flood dispersed into every corner of the outer forest. Also, this was merely the first beast flood. The weakest creatures were chased out. Clearly there was a second wave. This huge land would no longer be in peace.The experts retreated back to Little Lonely Mountain Town as they felt that the situation was becoming more and more problematic. The scene at the mountain range was too terrifying, and it was impossible for them to even enter. Forget about the mountain treasure, they could not even obtain the carcass of a beast descendant.\u201cAi, we came for nothing. I never thought the mountain range was this frightening. A powerful Demonic Ape was only in charge of driving away beasts, and this wasn\u2019t even the deepest region of the mountains. What kind of inconceivable thing do you think appeared within this endless mountain range?\u201d\u201cPerhaps a holy medicine or a heavenly bone from ancient myths?\u201d\u201cI have no idea, but we wasted our time here today. I don\u2019t want to stick around any longer. I\u2019m leaving tomorrow, otherwise, I might just die here.\u201dEveryone became dispirited. Many tribes joined together to muster up this large force, yet , the end result made everyone irreconcilable.\u201cEi,\u00a0right, within this territory, didn\u2019t some of the strongest tribes come here to fight against some small village? What happened, I heard they suffered some major losses?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a disciple of the Golden Wolf tribe and an expert from the Great Floating Pond here? Let them speak.\u201dLittle Lonely Mountain Town was bustling. The foreigners almost reached the number of the native population. Golden Wolf Tribe, Lightning Clan and large quantities of other experts entered and awaited orders.\u201cThat village wasn\u2019t simple, it caused the strongest groups within this vast land to experience great losses.\u201d\u201cAre you bullshitting me? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. The Golden Wolf Tribe and Great Floating Pool were both aristocratic groups. Don\u2019t they have the power to shake this boundless land?!\u201dNone of them could believe it, and they all revealed astonished expressions.A cold grunt echoed through, and an expert from the Golden Wolf Tribe came. He had an indifferent expression, and he spoke with ice cold eyes. \u201cThat village is almost finished. They are going to be wiped from existence!\u201dHe was extremely confident since the Golden Wolf Deity from his tribe came with them. This was the strongest Guardian Spirit within a circumference of 50000 li, and it had already lived for a long time. His clan lord might not be this area\u2019s number one expert, but this Golden Wolf Deity could certainly be the guardian spirit of any of their clans!All the experts were alarmed. Golden Wolf tribe is instilling such thunderous methods, how could the village possibly resist?\u201cWithin the mountain range, kings of Archaic Descendants lived there. Our tribe has no methods of fighting over the mountain treasure. However\u2026 eradicating a village that does not know how high the heavens or how thick the earth is wouldn\u2019t take too much effort.\u201d A disciple from the Great Floating Pool said in awe.Not long ago, they were met with a huge tragedy. Their leaders as well as Jiao Cang suffered great losses. The experts they dispatched were practically all exterminated, and this made their entire clan furious. This time, the strongest experts within their clan came personally, so how could they lack the strength to exterminate a simple village? They wouldn\u2019t believe it even if they were beaten to death.\u201cRight. We don\u2019t stand a chance for the mountain treasure, so we\u2019ll settle with getting revenge on that village. They obtained the precious carcass of a Suan Ni. How could a simple village possess such a holy creature?\u201d The people of Lightning Clan said.\u201cAh, Zishan Hou arrived!\u201d At this moment, voices of shock swept through Little Lonely Mountain Town.A round purple sun covered the sky. It was three feet above the ground as it rushed straight past the front of Little Lonely Mountain Town,\u00a0heading straight in\u00a0the direction of Stone Village. Although he passed by instantly, the terrifying aura that followed behind made everyone shudder.Apart from the hidden family \u2014 Cloud Clan, that is to say the powers from the mysterious Heavenly Cloud Palace, everyone knew that within a circumference of 50000 li, Zishan Hou was the number one expert.Even he came! Could it be he also wanted to eradicate this no name village?\u201cThe number one expert came. If he took action, perhaps only the Lightning Clan, the Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s Guardian Spirit and a few others could resist him!\u201d\u201cHeavens\u2026 It\u2019s actually Zishan Hou! Let\u2019s quickly take a look and see what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d The other experts were inspired because these utmost powers rarely went into action. Each time they did move out, however, a great tsunami would occur.\u201cClan head made his move, and naturally it\u2019s to flatten that village. They offended our clan Lord!\u201d A youngster from Purple Mountain Clan said proudly.\u201cIf Zishan Hou made his move, who could fight him? It he truly went all out, that group would certainly be extinguished,\u201d said a few people as they sighed. They had experienced this long ago. In the past Zishan Hou personally exterminated powerful tribes.Precisely at this moment, the people of Lightning Clan, Great Floating Pond, and the Golden Wolf tribe all seemed to be acting on some kind of order as they rushed into the forest. Soon after, Purple Mountain Clan\u2019s people started moving out as well.Several huge clans were actually moving in one direction. What was their target? Stone Village.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t obtain the mountain treasure, so they left to exterminate that village.\u201d Someone said with a sigh.\u201cTo actually go as far as to make several huge clans act against them and even making the four clan lords come, this mountain village really isn\u2019t simple!\u201d Quite a few people were surprised.Purple Mountain, Great Floating Pool, Lightning Clan, and Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s people moved out in an orderly fashion. This was a rare occurrence, and when people discussed it, they all became excited.

The strongest experts all left together, and everyone followed the four huge clans\u2019 experts out of the village to witness the upcoming large-scale battle.The forest was lush, and over the years, the leaves on the ground accumulated to over a foot thick. The ground was incredibly soft, and this didn\u2019t include the leaves that had decomposed into black soil ages ago, otherwise, it would be even thicker. The mountain ground was fertile, and ancient trees reached the skies.Many fierce beasts lived within the mountains, but with so many people moving together, whether it be huge beasts or vicious birds, they all withdrew from fear due to the number of people flooding through.\u201cThis is the village?\u201dThere was still quite a bit of distance in between them, yet the four huge tribes stopped roughly two or three li away and no longer moved forward. They scaled the cliffs, ascended onto high ground, and took advantageous positions as they overlooked that village.This common and simple village did not seem to contain a trace of abnormality. Stone houses built from mountain rocks had beast skins drying on them, and smoked meat hung nearby. Chickens and dogs moved about as elderly people basked in the sun while leaning against the walls. A group of children were running around each other for amusement.\u201cIs a village like this worth mustering such a large force over? In my opinion, a random horse running in this direction could flatten this entire village,\u201d said a person from the Golden Wolf Tribe. This was a group of armored horsemen, and all of them rode on top of Scaled Horses while clad in shining armor. Their spears were sharp and their swords were dazzling as they pointed forwards.\u201cThey dare to offend our Great Floating Pool\u2019s prestige, so they must be punished by death. This village must certainly be extinguished today!\u201d The group of young men clamored, and their expressions were cold. Jiao Cang lost an arm and became a cripple, so they had to avenge him.However, the four great clan heads ordered that no one was allowed to act blindly without thinking. They had to wait for upper command before moving out, and anyone that dared to act without permission would be severely punished.\u201cLooks like this village truly isn\u2019t simple. They made these groups of powerful people so careful and prudent.\u201d\u201cYi, where are the four tribe\u2019s leaders? Why aren\u2019t they here, what are they doing?\u201dThe experts who followed along struck up a discussion, and they were closely observing everything.Stone Village was tranquil. In the courtyard at the front of the village, the little guy held a pot and was preparing to boil some beast milk. He was trying to be sneaky, and looked toward the village entrance once in a while to avoid being discovered by the big kids.\u201cSo sweet.\u201d On top of a campfire, beast milk began to boil within a jar. He opened his nostrils and closed his eyes halfway. His eyes held an intoxicated expression.Pulengleng.Suddenly, the sound of bird wings flapping sounded. The little guy raised his head and showed an alarmed expression. \u201cHow come there\u2019s so many birds? Could it be that there\u2019s another beast flood?\u201dHe stood upright and left the courtyard before gazing towards the sky. He quickly discovered that something was strange. All kinds of flying beasts were scared off from the surrounding forests, and it looked like they all flew over two to three li away.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. There probably either vicious beasts or humans surrounding us right now!\u201d Shi Hao was quick and intelligent. He shouted out warnings to the other villagers right away.As a matter of fact, Shi Linghu and Shi Feijiao both sensed it immediately as well. The villagers were simple-minded, but it didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t vigilant. To live in these vile desolate lands for so long, they had to constantly hone their acute perception.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be those bastards who came last time right?\u201d Er Meng\u2019s dad shouted.On the hilltop, the four tribe\u2019s experts were all amazed. This village\u2019s reactions were too fast; the village was in indeed quite abnormal.\u201cYi, the chief came!\u201d The people of Golden Wolf Tribe cried out in alarm.A bold and powerful elderly man appeared. Dim golden light shined inside his eyes as if lightning was shooting out. The appearance of this incredibly powerful old man made it impossible for anyone to stand still.A Golden Wolf Deity also stood at his side. It wasn\u2019t too tall, but it took long strides with its head held high as it looked down on everyone else. It had a domineering attitude that made everyone revere it.Golden splendor circulated all over this wolf\u2019s body, and it was more awe-inspiring than any human could ever be. Its golden eyes held a callous feeling as it swept through everyone, and anyone who saw it began to take a step back. Everyone found it difficult to breath; it was even scarier than that old man.Everyone knew that this must be that so called \u2018strongest Guardian Spirit within a circumference of 50000 li\u2019.\u201cGolden Wolf Tribe, you people cannot hastily send out your troops. Please back off another li and wait for my command.\u201d After hearing these words, the bold and powerful old man disappeared into the forest like a streak of golden light.He quickly shortened the distance to a single li. Meanwhile, that Guardian Spirit stood on top of a mountain peak while staring down at Stone Village.At the same time, three supreme experts appeared at the same time from three different directions. They scaled the mountain cliffs and also began to survey Stone Village.Lightning Clan, Great Floating Pool, Purple Mountain Clan, and the Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s clan lords had all arrived. They each occupied one direction, and they wanted to employ a lightning method to carry out the extermination.A huge wave of sound exploded like thunder. From the west, a large river snaked its way in from the mountain forest, and the Great Floating Pool\u2019s clan lord currently stood on top of it. His entire body was enshrouded in water vapors, and light radiated about him from head to toe. A huge vicious Flood Dragon was beginning to take shape.This was caused by the activation of their blood essence, and he was trying to summon a huge Flood Dragon. Unexpectedly, it slowly struggled free out of his pack, and it was rather intimidating as it coiled around itself on the ground.He was using a precious technique, but his method seemed to be a bit strange.This Flood Dragon appeared from within his spine and it rapidly expanded. It was ten feet thick and over two thousand feet long, and its terror overflowed the heavens. Grey mist curled around it and huge flickering symbols appeared within the hollow sky.The vicious Flood Dragon roared, and the various lands around them all erupted into chaos. Boulders began to tumble down, and leaves began to madly flutter about.Aooo\u2026.With a roar, the grey vicious Flood Dragon swooped down from the skies to initiate its powerful offense on Stone Village, and this was a mind-blowing type of attack. The body of the huge Flood Dragon covered the sky, and the thick grey mist surged forth as if it appeared from primal chaos. It hissed and spat out a huge terrifying ray of light, shaking the mountain boulders below until they shattered.Outside of Stone Village, those mountain rocks and trees were long destroyed by this attack, and even the ground was cracked as a result. This vicious Flood Dragon was huge, and its terrifying attack shook everyone\u2019s hearts.\u201cWhat a powerful precious technique!\u201d Two to three li away, everyone was amazed. Their hair all stood upright, as this type of technique was simply too shocking. It really had the sufficient firepower to wipe out an entire tribe.\u201cThat\u2019s not right\u2026 that village isn\u2019t affected at all!\u201dAt the village entrance, the tender green branch of the willow tree was shining. It was emitted hazy halos of light to protect the village, blocking the vicious strike of the Flood Dragon.Afterwards, the branch quickly extended and rushed into the sky. It wanted to penetrate a hole out of that vicious Flood Dragon!Hong!Suddenly, a blazing and thunderous light shone from the north. Those were streaks of black lightning that struck down from atop a mountain summit, aiming to intercept the willow branch that stretched toward the sky.Lei Hou decided to make his move. When such a powerful emperor used all of his strength to activate his strongest precious technique, it appeared as if he had transformed into a Thunder God.\u201cThe spring comes upon a withered tree? I represent the Thunder God to once again destroy you. This time, you will be thoroughly disintegrated!\u201dA huge voice was released, and it sounded like the rolling of thunder, shaking the entire area. All the experts covered their ears, as the penetrative force of this voice was simply too powerful, causing leaves to fly about frantically.He did not attack the trunk of the willow tree, but rather to intercept that slender branch. This black lightning danced wildly through the air and oppressed its surroundings. Even the Heavens and the earth became dark, and the black light surged violently.Directly south, a wolf\u2019s howl resounded through the heaven and earth. The Wolf Deity howled towards the moon, and a veil of bright golden light covered the entire mountain peak. That Guardian Spirit was undergoing a terrifying transformation.Its back split apart and a golden crack appeared. Its hairs moved apart as its howls shook the entire mountain.Unexpectedly, it was molting. After the golden hair split apart, an even brighter Wolf Deity appeared from within. Each hair on its body looked as if it was casted out of gold.\u201cYa, that golden wolf is indeed terrifying. No wonder it was known as the most powerful Guardian Spirit within a circumference of 50000 li. \u00a0It already obtained a new body and shed its old skin, refining it into a precious artifact.\u201d Everyone was startled.Ordinarily, this golden wolf would wait patiently and continued to wear its old skin on its body. But today, it exposed its real body and its real strength.Multi-colored golden light flourished intensely. That wolf skin rapidly expanded and became life-like. It was as if a second Wolf Deity was alive, and it even had teeth as it flickered in cold light.Clearly, this Guardian Spirit was very thorough when it shed its skin. The skin it shed was completely intact, which made this treasured artifact very rare and powerful!\u201cAo\u2026.\u201d The Wolf Deity released a long howl that moved the heavens and the earth. The treasured artifact that the wolf shed began to send out immeasurable amounts of light, dying the heaven and earth in gold. It charged toward Stone Village to attack that willow tree.Everyone was shaking in fear. It was deserving of its title as the strongest Guardian Spirit within a circumference of 50000 li. This type of might was simply dreadful, and everyone felt fear from the bottom of their hearts.The Wolf Deity that was transformed from the golden wolf skin pounced directly towards the thick black trunk of the willow tree to pull it from its roots. Golden Light began to submerge the village.Hong!Purple clouds came from the east. These thick drizzling purple clouds covered the entire forest. It\u2019s terrifying might flowed into the heavens, and the number one expert, Zishan Hou, also began to make his move!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The clouds were majestic and boundless, and it was so oppressing that the onlookers felt their souls shudder. The clouds and mist transformed into a purple-colored giant, and the giant stamped down with one of its feet before heading towards the thick willow tree. It seemed to carry a divine power of the heaven and earth, as if heaven itself decided to take action.This kind of scene and atmosphere stunned everyone. Zishan Hou was indeed exceptional! His reputation was not in vain, and with that single foot alone, a tribe could have been completely destroyed!No wonder there was a rumor that whenever Zishan Hou decided to undertake a task, several enormous tribes would completely disappear. This method frightened everyone, and it was indeed a divine power that was hard to resist against.Stone Village was in a state of crisis. The willow tree was under joint attacks of four powerful supreme experts, and from top to bottom, each and every attack were astonishingly powerful.The willow branch did not change its trajectory and continued to advance upward like before to face the attack of The Great Floating Pool\u2019s clan lord.That creature in the sky was a vicious Flood Dragon over two thousand feet long. It filled the western sky as it emitted powerful multi-colored rays of light. Its offensive power was terrifying, and it caused many of the mountains and forest stones to disintegrate into fine powder.Chi!The green tender willow branch was able to overcome any obstacles in its way, and to everyone\u2019s surprise, it directly pierced through the forehead of that vicious Flood Dragon. It pierced all the way through, and like a divine chain with the might of heaven, it swept away everything in its path.The Flood Dragon was too large. Although it was penetrated thoroughly, causing its divine essence quickly dissipated, it was still making threatening gestures. It flew between the sky and the earth as it spat out multi-colored light to attack downwards. That terrifying attack struck Stone Village from all four sides. Rocks flew, mountains disappeared, and the great earth cracked.Xiu!The tender branch swayed back and forth as it emitted bright rays of light. The dark green branch wriggled around like a dragon before rapidly twisting itself around the neck of the vicious Flood Dragon. Then, with a fierce pull, the head of this Flood Dragon dropped straight towards the ground.From afar, the Great Floating Pool\u2019s clan lord who stood in front of the river in the forest spat of a mouthful of blood. Both his eyes emitted rays of light as he expressed his astonishment. He knew that the precious technique that contained his divine essence had been broken, and a split second later, it become that willow tree\u2019s \u2018tonic\u2019. That vicious Flood Dragon was shriveling at a visible rate as its divine essence was being sucked dry by the green tender branch, dispersing its divine light.Meanwhile, the willow branch was met with an attack from the north. Over ten lightning strikes arrived, and the black lightning danced violently in an attempt to intercept the alluring emerald green branch.Could it resist such an attack? No matter how you look at it, this tender and sparkling branch seemed weak and soft, while the lightning seemed so crazy and violent. The dark lightening interweaved, and even if it was fine metal, it would still be blasted into dust.Everyone held their breath. Thunder and lightning were some of the strongest forces between heaven and earth, and in particular, this willow tree was met with a similar attack before. It was burnt black previously, which meant that it was vulnerable to lightning. Confronted with this type of attack again, would it be able to survive?\u201cBy my name, I\u2019ll destroy you!\u201d Thunder God howled loudly and magnificently. The mountains resonated, and the earth trembled.However, an unexpectedly shocking event occurred. The thunder covering the sky surged forth and submerged the willow branch within it. Despite that, it seemed greener and more replenished than before, almost to the point that fresh dew was about to drip out.Everyone was overwhelmed with amazement. Lei Hou was tongue-tied, and it was the first time in first entire life that he lost his confidence.The willow branch swayed back and forth and sent out green ripples. The thunder and lightning was absorbed completely and disappeared from the sky. All this happened within a split second, causing everyone\u2019s mouth to be agape and speechless.Chi!Specks of green light rippled outwards. The willow branch gently swayed and drew a beautiful arc before extending towards the large river to the east.There was a figure standing there. He was shrouded by hazy water vapor, and emitted a formidable aura; this was precisely Great Floating Pool\u2019s clan lord. They were over one li apart, however, the willow branch arrived in the blink of an eye, and it was so fast that no one could react to it.Wu\u2026The tender branch slammed down with all its might, and Great Floating Pool\u2019s clan lord shouted out. At the extent of his resistance, he managed to bring out a beast bone. That beast bone was an extremely powerful precious artifact that acted as a substitute while his real body rapidly ran away.The entire region was brilliant and dazzling. Both the forest and the river reflected a brilliant light, however, this powerful precious artifact was not able to block the attack. With a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, the tender branch smashed it apart into powder. Symbols immediately disappeared, and its essence was absorbed into the green branch.\u201cAhhh\u2026 Nooo!\u201d Great Floating Pool\u2019s clan lord shouted in dismay. Although he fled quickly, it was too late. The willow branch that descended from high in the sky was sharper than an immortal sword. With a light stroke, it cut him into two pieces, causing its corpse to land in his own blood. Afterwards, essence began to boil and the man seemed to have aged ten thousand years. His flesh began to dry and crack apart as the corpse lost all of its divine powers.At this moment, everyone there became absolutely terrified and kept quiet out of fear. The faces of the people from the Great Floating Pool all paled to the limit. Not long ago, they were still talking big. If their clan lord came, then a simple village would be completely flattened to avenge Jiao Cang. Now however, the results were simply cruel and frightening. Great Floating Pool\u2019s most powerful expert, the clan lord, was directly chopped into two, and his blood spilt everywhere as he dropped straight to the ground.\u201cClan lord!\u201d Many people were grieving.At this moment, countless people\u2019s hair began to stand up, and their scalps began to numb. This willow tree was too frightening and it simply wasn\u2019t an enemy they could face.\u201cClan lord! Run away!\u201d Lightning Clan\u2019s people cried out in alarm as they warned Lei Hou.Because, the tender branch was emitting specks of divine light. It turned around and changed its direction towards the north to attack Lei Hou.In reality, Lie Hou discovered that something was off long ago. He reacted immediately and took out his precious artifact to draw out the power of thunder and lightning. He elevated three feet off the ground as he prepared to escape into the distance.However, the willow branch\u2019s speed was too fast. Like a green beam of light, it swept across the northwest direction until it arrived.With a\u00a0xiu\u00a0sound, the mountain where Lei Hou stood was cut off like a hot knife through butter. It still did not stay still, and within a breath\u2019s time, it sculpted upwards towards Lei Hou\u2019s back with the intention of penetrating his heart.\u201cOpen for me!\u201dLei Hou shouted out loudly. Every hair on his body stood up, and rays of electricity shot out everywhere as he was enveloped in a sphere of glaring lightning. He released incredibly large amounts of electricity and collapsed that mountain.The willow branch stopped at this moment and did not pierce his body, but instead absorbed the electric light. Then, it suddenly curled around Lei Hou and hung him on the branch before returning back to Stone Village.To many people\u2019s surprise, the powerful Lei Hou was captured just like that. The willow tree did not kill him but instead brought him back.Lei Hou hissed and continuously tried to struggle free. His precious artifact emitted light and resonated as he wanted to snap the willow branch apart. However, everything he did was futile, as it didn\u2019t harm the branch at all. The willow tree pleasingly absorbed all the electricity he released.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Everyone was astonished and figured out what the willow tree wanted to do. It wanted Lei Hou to continuously use his precious technique to constantly shoot out lightning so that it could absorb everything.\u201cBeing reborn from within its destruction, it was unexpectedly nourished from the lightning\u2026.\u201dEveryone was scared stiff. This willow tree was too demonic, and could not be measured by common sense. The four huge clans attacking it together like this, yet it was still such a fatal miscalculation.Lei Hou was hung from the willow tree at the village entrance as he continuously struggled, but his strength was gradually weakening. It did not look like he could live much longer.Everyone trembled. This was the magnificent Lei Hou, one of the two clan lords of an aristocratic territory, yet he became a prisoner just this. It was truly inconceivable!The things that happened today were destined to spread throughout the land. The name of Stone Village would shake the world. It was just a Guardian Spirit that looked as if it was on the verge of death, scorched black all over, yet it was so terrible. It killed one, and hung the other; those were two of the four huge clan lords! It truly held a world-shocking divine power.Lightning Clan\u2019s people expression were ugly to the extreme. Their majestic clan lord that commanded everything and taken control of countless territories had actually been taken prisoner.Not long ago, the experts from their clan were still talking about how effortless it would be to get rid of Stone Village, and how the Suan Ni\u2019s precious bones as well everything else in the village would be theirs. The things that happened now wasn\u2019t just a slap on their face, this was peeling off their skin. Their clan lord was going to die!Everything happened within a spark\u2019s time. One clan lord was killed right away, and another was taken prisoner. The attacks from the other two directions just barely started.That golden wolf skin precious artifact and the genuine Wolf God weren\u2019t too different from each other. Their entire bodies looked as if they were casted from metal. They pounced right in front of the willow tree and used their huge claws to dig away the soil and the rocks in order to uproot the tree.However, after the surface barely exposed a root, the Wolf God immediately became horrified. The root rushed out like a dragon and constricted it right away before dragging it through a crack in the ground.Aoooo\u2026The Golden Wolf God let out a long wail. Each and every strand of dazzling hair stood up from its body, and they emitted brilliant light as it struggled violently. It grabbed toward the root using both its claws with all its might.Kacha!What shocked people was that those huge sharp golden claws were directly snapped apart into three pieces by the root. With a brush of its roots, soil and rocks flew up, submerging everything within.Everyone stared blankly and were stupefied. Such a powerful precious artifact, practically identical to the personal strength of the Wolf God, was immediately destroyed.Before the sandy soil completely covered up, the people discovered that the golden wolf skin began to rot and break down into fertilizer.\u201cThis powerful precious artifact, the skin of the number one Guardian Beast within fifty thousand li could only become fertilizer?!\u201d Everyone present was terrified.The faces of everyone from the Golden Wolf Tribe lost their color. That was their supreme Wolf God with the reputation of being this land\u2019s number one Guardian Spirit, and it was oppressed just like that.They remembered what they said not long ago: to ride their horses over and flatten this land. Now, those words seemed like a joke.With this willow tree here on this huge piece of land, who else would dare be called the number one Guardian Spirit?Honglong!In midair, a huge purple foot descended and treaded toward the willow tree. That was Zishan Hou\u2019s attack. He was the number one expert in this piece of land, and this attack could be said to shock even the heavens.The willow branch coiled around Lei Hou and swayed with the wind. It then lifted up its most tender part, the tip of the branch, and lightly flicked. Suddenly, a green whirlpool appeared that gradually grew in size until it created a hurricane!This scene was absolutely astonishing. All the experts who looked at this became stupefied. This change was all too sudden. It was just a tender bud flicking lightly, yet it created this dreadful force of nature.This was the first time the willow branch employed another attack. It saw Zishan Hou was out of the ordinary, and that he deserved his reputation as the number one expert.Hong!That green whirlpool expanded and connected the earth and the sky. It was lofty and imposing as it shook everything in all four directions. Like a violent mountain torrent, it struck the sky. Rumbling sounds followed, shaking all the experts until they collapsed and choked.That big purple foot was pulled into the middle of the whirlpool, and then the entire huge purple giant toppled over with a rumble. It entirety collapsed within the hurricane and was torn apart.Now, the scene only contained shock and dismay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The green whirlpool reached the skies and ripped everything apart. That huge purple giant was obliterated into fine powder.The clan lord of the Great Floating Pool met his death, Lei Hou was taken prisoner, the golden wolf\u2019s precious skin artifact was destroyed and the collapse of Zishan Hou\u2019s giant all happened in an instant.Ao\u2026.During the course of these events, the Wolf God\u2019s reaction was quick. When the clan lord of the Great Floating Pool was killed, it turned around and fled, leaving behind a golden trail.A wolf\u2019s nature was cunning. It immediately felt that something was wrong. Its golden body collided against mountains and destroyed forests, and its speed reached its peak as it charged into the dense forest.In reality, when it activated the golden wolf skin to attack, it had already became a golden light beam as it fled into the ancient mountain range.Known as the number one Guardian Spirit in a circumference of fifty thousand li, its instincts and perception were both extremely strong. Right now, however, it did not hold a tyrannical aura and instead only had fear; it did not dare to stop for even a moment.Although the strength of the old man from the Golden Wolf Tribe was powerful and controlled a lot of territory, in the end he was still no match for the Wolf God. His reactions were slightly slower. As soon as he snapped back to reality, he hurriedly tried to escape.\u201cRelease the arrows!\u201dAt the same time, he gave the orders for the experts of his tribe to stop and buy him time. At just that moment, ten thousand arrows flew up and the sound of air cracking continuously rang out. The dense sheet of iron arrows flew together in the direction of Stone Village.However, this act was absolutely useless. The green whirlpool expanded and distorted the trajectories all the flying arrows. They were snapped and broken one after another. This spectacle shocked and stunned everyone in place; it was too terrifying. This willow tree was absolutely too powerful, how could anything oppose it?Wu\u2026The hurricane whistled like the howl of an Archaic Descendant, trembling the entire mountain range. The Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s clan lord screamed out as his body involuntarily flew into the eye of the storm.\u201cNo!\u201d he cried out in horror. If he were to enter inside, his death would be certain. Even with his immense powers, he could not possibly defend against the attacks of the willow tree.Shua!An incredibly shocking streak of golden light rushed forth and fluctuated like the rising tides. This sun-like ray of splendid light made everyone shudder as it hacked towards the hurricane.\u201cAncestral Artifact!\u201d\u201cThe clan lord brought the Ancestral Artifact!\u201dEveryone from the Golden Wolf Tribe cried out in shock and became excited. They awaited the destruction of the hurricane and the death of that willow tree.However, right as they began to get excited, everything changed. When the golden light beam met the green whirlpool, the Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s clan lord lost control. The light began to darken and was expelled out.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dGolden Wolf Tribe\u2019s clan lord let of a huge scream. His own body was being torn apart and his blood began to float outwards. He became a muddled pile of blood within the hurricane, and ceased to exist.Everyone was terrified, and they all felt waves of dread.Pa!The Ancestral Artifact that escaped landed in front of the people from the Golden Wolf Tribe. This was a dagger over a foot long, and a golden shine flowed from its tip to its shaft. After encountering the green whirlpool, the symbols on the dagger dimmed, but it still managed to finally escape.If one examined carefully, one would discover that it was polished from a golden beast tooth that held a mysterious and terrifying strength. All the experts from the Golden Wolf Tribe began to tremble. An elder shuddered as he cupped the artifact in his hand, and his heart began to bleed. Never could he have imagined that even this wasn\u2019t enough to defeat the willow tree.This wasn\u2019t a tooth dropped by their Guardian Spirit, this was an artifact that came from an ancient country.In the past, before the Golden Wolf Tribe migrated, they had to present tribute to an ancient country each year. Their ancestors offered their great services to them and also bestowed their tribe with a precious artifact \u2014 the Wolf Tooth Dagger.At that time, the Golden Wolf Tribe was extremely powerful and incomparably glorious. Later on, it began to decline, and after many years, a branch of the original tribe migrated here to form the tribe here today.This precious artifact fell into their branch\u2019s hands.The Wolf Tooth Dagger was a tooth dropped by the ancient country\u2019s Guardian Spirit. Although the innate divine essence was extracted by the ancient country, after being transformed into precious artifact, its might was still beyond comprehension. However, it unexpectedly faced the tragedy of meeting this willow tree, and so it ran away with only a dim luster remaining.\u201cZishan Hou ran away too!\u201dOnly at this moment did the people discovered that the reputed number one expert within a circumference of fifty thousand li had long transformed into a purple sun and fled into the ancient mountains while sticking close to the ground.He fled at the same moment the Golden Wolf did, and he left a precious artifact where he originally stood. It emitted multicolored light that condensed into a human body to become his scapegoat.In the end, there was only one willow branch. So after sweeping in all four directions, it only had enough time to pursue and destroy the precious artifact. It withdrew its divine essence and did not chase after the number one expert. The hurricane that reached the sky began to rapidly shrink and\u00a0disappear, returning tranquility back to the area. The four experts\u2019 attacks were all fruitless; thus, everybody there felt deep dread!Silence spread throughout the four huge clans. They mustered up their forces to come here, but in the end only one clan lord managed to escape. The rest were either killed or taken prisoner. This slap on their faces was too loud and clear.They believed that since they had control of this great land, no one could resist them. Each time they moved out, they would gather all the tribes. The reason for their arrival this time was to flatten Stone Village, however, this was the final result.Looking back, their powerful extermination operation was simply a joke. In front of this terrifying willow tree, they really were insignificant.Right now, the four huge tribes were scared, afraid, and angry. Their emotions were complex, as their clan lords were killed. This sort of disgrace made them indignant yet fearful as they clenched their fists.\u201cMy father cannot die like this for nothing. I need an explanation!\u201d One of the majestic youths of the Golden Wolf Tribe roared. His eyes were like a wolf\u2019s, flashing with violent radiance.\u201cLittle clan lord, calm down. We have no way of resisting against this demonic willow. No matter how many people we send, it will all be for naught. Even the clan lord has perished.\u201d\u201cWolf Tooth Dagger fell here, but the demonic willow did not pursue and attack here. I speculate it could only stretch out over one li, and not any further,\u201d said the youth in a cold voice. His eyes swiveled and he prepared to dispatch his army.After saying this, everyone became startled.Bang!At this moment, Lei Hou who was hung on the willow tree finally exhausted all of his divine essence. He had difficulty activating his thunder again, and his entire body dried up before fell falling to the ground like a broken teapot, cracking into pieces.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dWithin the Lightning Clan, many people were letting out long cries. They were angry and mournful. The eyes of Lei Hou\u2019s heir were completely red. He wanted to start a huge battle with everything on the line.\u201cOur Great Floating Pool would not back off easily as well. Since it can\u2019t attack here easily, let\u2019s cook Stone Village from afar and start a massacre!\u201d shouted a few people from the Jiao Clan. Their clan lord died here, so their animosity was too great to hold back.Only Purple Mountain Clan did not show any expression, because Zishan Hou had fled.\u201cBack off, let\u2019s try an attack!\u201dGreat Floating Pool, Golden Wolf Tribe, and Lightning Clan all backed over five li. They left some people at the original location. They armed their huge bows and shot out one arrow after another towards Stone Village.These archers\u2019 arm strengths were incredibly strong. Accurately and steadily, they concentrated all of their firepower on Stone Village.Sure enough, their distance was far enough. The willow branch did not start any of its attacks. Only a layer of light shrouded the entire village, breaking all the arrows on impact and preventing them from entering.A huge fire ignited outside the village, however, the raging flames were unable to extend into the village.\u201cIt\u2019s useless.\u201d Everyone sighed and at the same time were afraid.\u201cSiege here, the villagers here cannot leave. If they can\u2019t hunt, sooner or later they will starve!\u201d Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s little clan lord fiercely shouted.\u201cLittle clan lord, let\u2019s just back off. Otherwise, a clan extermination calamity will occur,\u201d some people urged.In actuality, all the experts of the four huge clans still had some lingering fears. The vast majority of them wanted to escape right away, and did not wanted to stay here for another second. However, the clan lord\u2019s heirs and the other authoritative personnel only had blood within their eyes, losing all reason. They wanted to take revenge no matter what.\u201cOur Great Floating Pool will never cower. We will certainly avenge our brethren. Siege this place and starve those people to death!\u201d Roared the clan lord\u2019s younger brother.Jiao Clan\u2019s people had a huge fear within their hearts. Some unwilling people were opposed to this.\u201cYou know that death is certain, so why fight. We can\u2019t do this. That\u2019s your brother, so you take revenge. We don\u2019t want to give up our lives for nothing.\u201cWhat did you say? Our clan lord just died and you guys don\u2019t want to take revenge and instead want to run away. Are you still men of the Great Floating Pool?\u201dSuddenly, the Great Floating Pool almost rebelled and started a revolution.The same thing was happening within the Lightning Clan and the Golden Wolf Tribe. No one wished to throw away their lives, and they all wanted to get as far away from that demonic willow tree as they could.In the end, some people ran away while others obediently surrounded Stone Village, preparing to sever them from any food source.Hou\u2026That Golden Wolf God rushed back and directly returned in front of the Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s little clan lord. He sent him flying with a slap, and afterwards, it put the precious artifact \u2013 Wolf Tooth Dagger into his mouth before turning around and fleeing. It became a streak of golden light beam, and it disappeared within the blink of an eye.Everyone was dumbstruck and cried out in fear again.\u201cLittle clan lord, let\u2019s back off, this is a bad omen! Our Guardian Spirit abandoned us and took away our tribe\u2019s ancestral artifact!\u201d a clan elder shouted in dismay.Not only their clan, but even the Great Floating Pool and the people of Lightning Clan were frightened, and all of them wanted to leave. As far as Purple Mountain Clan was concerned, they left a long time ago. Not a single one of them stopped, and it was obvious that Zishan Hou gave the orders to back away and discontinue the struggles.Xiu!Suddenly, that willow branch moved again. This time rays of light flourished greatly and was far more dazzling than it had ever been before. In the blink of an eye, it shot out over four to five li. It fiercely waved and peeled off the mountains and cut off their peaks. Rumbling noises sounded all over and the forests were swept away.The Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s little clan head screamed loudly. Heads started flying and many of the people who remained to fight were chopped directly into two pieces. Carcasses dropped to the floor and blood splashed everywhere.Soon after, the Jiao clan of Great Floating Pool also became like this. Many of the people in power were killed as the willow branch swept through. Blood blossomed into the air as one head after another flew up.At death\u2019s door, these people\u2019s faces froze in horror as they felt endless remorse. It wasn\u2019t that the willow tree couldn\u2019t stretch to this place, but rather that it was merely ignoring them.Pu! Pu!After beheading the important characters, the willow tree did not massacre wantonly and only targeted their mounts. The willow branch successively penetrated one mount after another until it pierced the majority of them.Finally, over a hundred mounts, including the Scaled Horses, Unicorns and Moon Rhinoceros, were all pierced by the willow branch and dragged back into Stone Village. This time, it did not absorb their divine essence, but rather threw them right onto the streets.\u201cRun!\u201dThe experts of the four huge clans were appalled. They fled for their lives and did not dare to stay another second.Everyone within Stone Village became stupefied. The willow tree was too powerful.After a long while, Shi Linghu turned around and begrudgingly said, \u201cThis is an Unicorn, able to run ten thousand li a day. It\u2019s such a rare mount.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a couple of feathered tigers here and some other rarely seen beasts!\u201d a few village elders said in surprise.Every one held the willow tree in an incomparable and heartfelt reverence. The willow tree protected their village. In everyone\u2019s mouths were the words \u201cWillow Deity\u201d as they piously prayed to it.Suddenly, a divine message rang out, \u201cThis is food, prepare an adequate amount of it. A great calamity approaches.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Everyone was shocked.\u201cIt\u2019s the Guardian Spirit. The Willow Deity that defended us has spoken.\u201d The little guy stared with his eyes wide open. Bright rays of light flickered within his eyes as he stared at the scorched black willow tree in amazement.\u2014Author Notes: Some people were calculating the length of 50000 li and say it\u2019s only 130 li, and I began to sweat a waterfall! This is just an estimate and not exact. The 50000 li in the novel means a radius of 50000 li or a length of 50000 li. This wide of a range is bigger than even the earth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It only had a single willow branch that was glistening and replete with moisture as it swayed freely in the wind.For over ten years, it never said a single thing. Why did it decide to speak today? The little guy blinked his large eyes; he was extremely curious.\u201cWe pay respects to the Willow Deity!\u201dThe villagers were all frightened, and their hearts were extremely reverent. The willow tree\u2019s actions greatly exceeded their imaginations. Everyone prostrated themselves in front of it as they prayed for Stone Village\u2019s continuous protection.A few older elders trembled as they lead the prayers. With devout hearts, they spoke out sincerely to convey their respects.A mysterious power appeared, and it was extremely bizarre. It was similar to the power that the first natives received when they sacrificed to their gods as recorded in the ancient Bone Texts. Power rippled and began to spread outwards.The ancient cauldron that they inherited from their ancestors began to resonate. The sun, moon, mountains, rivers as well as the first natives on the cauldron began to appear more distinct. A simple ancient and mysterious power circulated about as it filled the air.However, the willow tree stayed silent just like it had been for the past ten years. It was almost as if it never even spoken at all.\u201cListen and obey the warnings of the Willow Deity. Start storing up food!\u201d a village elder calmly gave out instructions.The village suddenly became busy and bustling. Over 100 mounts\u2019 corpses laid in the middle of the street like a mountain. There was enough food to last the villagers for quite a while. To prevent it from rotting, they had to find ways to preserve it.Today, the smell of meat wafted throughout the village. All the households were either nervously making jerky or smoking meat. Even the children helped. The willow tree spoke; this had never happened in the past ten years. The villagers did not dare treat its words as a hollow threat. Their hearts were anything but calm as they earnestly prepared for an imminent disaster.Purple Mountain, Lightning Clan, Great Floating Pool, and the Golden Wolf Tribe all mustered up huge forces. In the end, however, they all fled for their lives. They were put into an extremely difficult situation, and Little Lonely Mountain Town was in a state of chaos.All the humans and creatures within the four huge clans were dejected. They all became birds that were scared away by the twang of a bow. Dread lingered within their hearts, as they had truly lost all face this time. They were resting and reorganizing within Little Lonely Mountain Town, none of them as valiant as they were before. No one dared to raise the subject of attacking Stone Village again, and many of them no longer dared to utter that name.\u201cSuch a disgrace. The powerful four great clans that controlled so much land and commanded so much prestige in these lands weren\u2019t even able to strike down a little village.\u201d A few clan elders were angry beyond belief.After venting out their anger for a bit, many people shivered. The willow tree was too powerful, and it was impossible for them to defeat it. This time their losses were too great. They beat their chests and stamped their feet in regret.This type of huge event would naturally instill a great commotion and attract many misfortunes. The four clans decided to leave as soon as possible.For them, this was a demonic land stained with blood. A village was actually able to cause three lords from the great clans to die. This defeat was simply unimaginable.At this moment, the heart of the mountain range began to rile up as well.Strands of mist rose up into the air, and the mountain scenery began to distort as if it was put into a state of chaos. Suddenly, the cries of the beasts stopped, and a deathly silence loomed over.A huge silhouette emerged, curling around the dense mist. Its body wasn\u2019t visible, but its terrifying aura trembled the heavens and the\u00a0earth. The ravines and mountains shook, and all the birds and beasts trembled on the floor as they paid their respects.It was holding up the heavens while standing on the earth; its height was immeasurable. Its figure entered the clouds and only its huge eyes could be seen. They were shining with a ghastly green, as if they were two lakes floating in the sky. Their diameter was several li and its murderous aura shocked the heavens!It was difficult to imagine exactly what kind of creature this was. The immensity of its body was unknown. If news of this spread into the outer world, the entire world would tremble.\u201cThis divine object is mine!\u201d It bellowed out with a deep voice that was as oppressive as a thunderclap. It shook the mountains so much that they practically collapsed. The birds and the beasts in the far distant mountains were all shuddering slightly.Dong!What he got in response was a huge iron rod, and it was so thick that it seemed like a pillar that supported the heavens. It swept past, bringing with it whistling violet winds. Mountain rocks flew about, and a fog surged up.This attack looked like it could destroy the world and pierce the heavens!Aooo\u2026A demonic roar engulfed the nine heavens. That huge silhouette stretched out its enormous earth-shattering claw. It was powerful enough to crush the mountain ridge, and cold light flickered about this incomparably sharp claw.Dang!The huge claw collided with that iron rod above the clouds, and it looked as if the sky itself was being torn apart. Clouds dispersed, and all kinds of multi-colored light burst forth. This supreme precious technique erupted, drowning the heaven and earth.Xiu, xiu!In the sky, one strange bone after another fell down. Some had the scarlet color of a blood diamond, others were as pitch black as ink, and there were even many that were spotless and shiny; they were all mysterious precious bones that blossomed with a precious light.If the experts outside of the mountain range saw this, their eyes would all become red. These were all bones from the bodies of Archaic Descendants. There were over ten pieces, how shocking of a treasure was this?!These precious bones that had primitive symbols condensed on them flew down, scattering everywhere within this boundless mountain range and fixing themselves to the insides of the valleys. Astral winds from the upper heavens once again powerfully smashed down, yet it was still not enough to collapse the great mountain.That huge body surpassed the clouds, and it towered between heaven and earth. With two ghastly green eyes as large as lakes, it opened its ice-cold mouth and said \u201cToo soft-hearted!\u201dHong!It spurted out terrifying rays of light that directly engulfed the heaven and earth. If the precious bones from earlier suppressed the boundless mountains, people would be inevitably be put into grave danger. It shook the clouds in the sky loose and hacked forth with a resplendent divine light; this was its strongest precious technique.Dong!Once again, the only response it received was an iron rod. It split the bright precious technique open, and huge soundwaves exploded through the air. Moreover, an extremely powerful primitive symbol appeared and with a keng qiang\u00a0sound,\u00a0the rod emitted immeasurable amounts of dense light. With the addition of this light, the divine might of this rod rapidly increased.This was a fierce battle. Two unimaginable existences were laying down their primitive symbols within the mountain valleys as they fought a life or death battle.\u201cYou and that little scarlet sparrow both suffered from the previous fight, so retreat is your only option!\u201d \u00a0Its green eyes only held a terrifying ghastly cold light, exposing its endless killing intent.The great battle continued!Hong!Suddenly, from the other side of the heart of the mountain range, a blazing light shot into the heavens. A little red bird appeared as it battled with another frightening creature in a world-shaking battle.\u201cI never thought you\u2019d still be alive in this world.\u201dHou!Altogether, there were four supreme creatures whose terrifying might surpassed all imaginations as they battled. Even the Demonic Ape, Flaming Devil Bull and other strong Archaic Descendants were trembling as they hid in the distance without a trace of movement.Within Little Lonely Mountain Town, the experts were shocked as even they heard the noises within the depths of the mountain range. They gazed in that direction, and saw chaotic mist swirling about and over ten pieces of beast bones suppressing the mountain range, but no one was able to see what exactly was happening.\u201cWhat happened? Could it be the mountain treasure actually appeared, and that they are currently fighting a final decisive battle over it?\u201dJust as they spoke, a divine light broke through the skies within the boundless mountain, and a chaotic mist surged violently. Even though over ten precious bones suppressed the valleys, the mountain range still trembled violently.A peerless precious technique was activating, and the heavens and the earth quaked in fear. Everyone was scared and overwhelmed. At this moment, their souls began to throb as many of them kneeled onto the floor.Everyone\u2019s bodies shook and shivered. That was the most powerful pressure they\u2019ve ever faced, and it made them involuntarily kowtow and worship.How frightening were these creatures? Everyone was cold from head to toe. A few people thought back to when they still had thoughts of searching for the mountain treasure; those truly were thoughts belonging to those who were tired of living! It was fortunate that they backed off!Run!This was what everyone thought within their heart. In this desolate land, staying still for even a moment could increase the dangers by tenfold. If they messed up by even a small bit, they would cease to exist.Lightning Clan, Great Floating Pool, and Golden Wolf Tribe\u2019s mounts and men were trembling even more. A willow tree already made them feel such dread, yet with these existences within the heart of the mountain, they felt that this place was not a place people could stay at. Their best choice of action was to turn back and escape as quickly as possible.The villagers of Little Lonely Mountain Town were frightened. Even the huge clans and their utmost experts were fleeing for their lives towards the open land, and none of them wanted to be near this place for a second longer.Hong!Suddenly, in the middle of the boundless mountain range. A world-shaking sound was produced. Rubble penetrated the sky as they bursted in mid-air. A chaotic mist began to spread, covering the entire mountain range.An immortal light rushed towards the heavens, and auspicious vapors surged up as they arrived in front of the open skies. It was like the birth of the most valuable treasure since the creation of the world. It floated and sank there and it shook the entire desolate region.\u201cThe mountain treasure has entered the world!\u201dAt this moment, no one needed to say anything. Everyone knew that it was the divine object that emitted that light.With a rumbling sound, the far side of the mountain range began to boil, and the battle increased in ferocity. The four incomprehensibly powerful beings were fighting life and death for the mountain treasure that had just appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The experts who were running away immediately began to feel weak, and many of them fell onto the ground.Their mounts stopped listening to orders a long time ago, and their bodies were weak as they laid on the ground. They were shivering non-stop, and they were so terrified that they didn\u2019t even dare lift their heads as they kowtowed towards the desolate lands.At the farthest ends of the mountain range, dreadful auras shocked the world as the four great creatures engaged in a fierce battle. Just like the birth of a new world, fire sometimes pierced into the heavens, black mists sometimes covered the sun, and sometimes an iron rod would fly across the vast sky\u2026This was a world-shaking battle. If not for the ten or so precious bones within the valley suppressing this vast mountain range, it would be hard to imagine the state these lands would be in right now.In this chaotic mist, a bird cry pierced the nine heavens. The little fiery red sparrow fought angrily against its opponent in close-quarters. It controlled scarlet flames that pierced the heavens to cook half of the sky in unbearable heat.Hou\u2026A large roar shook the heaven and earth. Its opponent swallowed mountains and rivers, and it possessed majestic aura that overlooked the world. Multi-colored light exploded into the heavens to suppress the blazing fire in the sky.If anyone was here, they would be left dumbstruck. The little red sparrow\u2019s opponent was a huge bird that sounded just like a beast. It swayed the mountains and rivers, and if not for the precious bones suppressing the mountains, everything would have been destroyed.Honglong!Its huge wings covered the sky, and like a black cloud, it concealed the heavens. It unexpectedly dimmed the scarlet fire by a great amount, and a pair of huge talons probed downwards in an attempt to grab the little red sparrow.That vicious bird was too big, and it filled the entire sky. The pair of feathered wings lying across the sky covered a hundred thousand mountains. Its strength was tremendous, and it made the human\u2019s souls shiver with fear.Jiu!WIth a shrill chirp, the fiery red sparrow flew up. Although its size wasn\u2019t great, its power was incomparable. After It collided against the huge talons, sparks flew in every direction.The two exchanged blows with all their might. The huge bird shrouded the skies and covered the earth. Its entire body was surrounded by black fog, so it was difficult to see its body. From the distance, only its huge bloody red eyes that looked like two bloody moons were visible in the sky.Hong!That huge vicious bird was simply too large. As its two wings flapped, it seemed as if the skies could no longer contain it. Its attack power was unmatched, and it shook the heavens with each movement.The little red bird was struggling from its injuries. It had already fought day and night against that iron rod creature, and both sides suffered as a result of that fight.Xiu, xiu\u2026Multi-colored scarlet rays broke through the skies. Dense symbols interweaved as they flickered all over the little red sparrow\u2019s body. It opened its sparkling red diamond-like beak and spouted out streaks of blazing light.This was an incomparably powerful precious technique. Divine light transformed into sharp scarlet immortal swords that brought out heavenly flaming light as it chopped towards the huge bird.Hou\u2026That huge black mist-covered vicious bird let out a wild roar. It sensed a great danger approaching, and therefore unraveled its wings before entering the blue skies.At the exact same time, a black mist began to boil. After entering the boundless blue skies, all of its iron feathers spread open. Symbols flickered and covered the entire heaven and earth. It rained down endless black light onto the ground.Qiang, qiang!Divine rays of light exploded out of the sky. Black and scarlet divine swords collided with each other like comets, and clanking noises resonated outwards, shocking the desolate lands.Wuwu\u2026On the other side, strong winds whistled through the air and broke through the nine heavens. That huge iron rod held by the large hairy hand swept through the sky and earth as its fierce battle with the indomitable creature reached its climax. Each time the two collided, the skies would be torn open, and their chaotic auras would spread out.Multi-colored light was released in all four directions, and sharp vapors cut through the air. The artifact that appeared bobbed up and down in the air, however, the four great creatures did not take control of it right away and instead focused on taking care of their opponents.With these four creatures here, no other lifeforms dared to approach. Even Archaic descendants like the Demonic Ape and the Flaming Devil Bull could only shiver with coldness. They hid far away and feared getting any closer.The intensity of the great battle gradually increased. The four unimaginably powerful existences were risking life and limb as they fought. A terrifying atmosphere rushed out into the desolate lands, frightening the spectators until their souls trembled.Weng!\u00a0The heaven and earth shook dramatically. A huge dreadful claw that covered the skies struck towards the little red sparrow. Divine light surged like raging waves beating against the shore. This was a surprise attack. That towering creature with ghostly green eyes suddenly unleashed an attack, ignoring its iron rod opponent, and aimed towards the little red sparrow.The fiery red sparrow was angered. Both its wings spread out violently and a scarlet hurricane that was able to rip apart the heaven and earth surged forth. Terrifying flames filled its interior as it swept towards that huge claw.At the same time, that huge bird on the other side swooped down right away in a criss cross path towards the iron rod. The creature amidst the chaotic mist cut horizontally across the sky. It appeared more majestic than the black clouds and emitted black fog that reached the heavens. Its pair of blood moon like eyes shot out two bloody spears as thick as the loftiest mountains and flew forward.Honglong!The heaven and earth shook and violently swayed. The four great lifeforms switched opponents in the blink of an eye. They used everything they had to kill each other in this life and death battle.The mountain range was endless and majestic. There were tens of thousands of lofty peaks situated side by side. One patch after another of flourishing symbols flickered. Some symbols were scarlet red like blood, some were pitch-black like ink, and some were as pure-white as crystals. However, they all blossomed between the heavens and the earth, and these symbols represented the \u00a0Archaic Descendants\u2019 precious bones suppressing the entire mountain range. Otherwise, during this fierce battle, even if they did not bring the entire sky down, a difficult to deal with disaster would be imminent.On the far reaches of the mountain range\u2019s border, those experts endured this soul-crushing fear. They staggered as they fled for their lives. This area was too frightening, and it was difficult to imagine just what kind of creature those were. Even the light they emitted made their knees weak, and their hearts were in a constant state of fear.At this very moment, they wished that they could escape into another country and avoid this calamity!In Stone Village, the towering willow stood there with its single swaying branch. Although the villagers were palpitating, they weren\u2019t like those experts from the outside world whose souls were trembling. Evidently, they were receiving some protection.\u201cA large battle is occurring in the middle of the mountains. We truly have no way of knowing just what kind of divine creatures are causing such an intense battle.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that there was a mysterious power locking the mountain valleys in place. Otherwise, everything within a range of fifty thousand li might have encountered disaster a long time ago.Shi Feijiao and Shi Linghu were muttering. The two became anxious and frightened at the thought of how long this terrifying battle would continue for.Suddenly, a loud bird cry echoed through the sky, and a large vicious bird covered in dense green scales appeared, and its silver polished wings were dyed in different hues.\u201cYa, it\u2019s Aunt Green Scaled Eagle, its appearance changed. Its green wings became silver wings!\u201d The little gazed into the sky in surprise.Jiu Jiu\u2026Da Peng, Xiao Qing, Zi Yun were all very excited. They flapped their wings and rushed toward the village entrance towards the cry in the sky.The Green Scaled Eagle transformed. Silver light flickered along its metallic pair of wings as a holy aura flowed along it. It devoured the meat of a Suan Ni and underwent this transformation.One could clearly feel that its aura became even more fearsome, and its power greatly exceeded before to a whole level!Hu\u2026A violent gale whistled past and the Green Scaled Eagle descended. It withdrew its pair of huge wings and those three hatchlings pounced towards it immediately before continuously rubbing their heads against its body.Right now, this vicious bird was very uneasy. It escaped from the mountain ranges because the battle within the heart of the mountains was too terrifying. Even though it sealed itself away, its soul was still trembling.\u201cAuntie Green don\u2019t go out again. Stay in this village for a while.\u201d The little guy walked forward.The villagers all came up as well. They were quite familiar with this Archaic Devil Bird\u2019s descendant now, and as they all experienced trials of life and death together, they did not want it to leave anymoreThe Green Scaled Eagle nodded, since its original intention was to avoid disaster.The desperate battle continued. Within the heart of the mountains, if it wasn\u2019t a tsunami like beast cry that engulfed the nine heavens and trembled everything between heaven and earth, then it was an astonishing bird cry that sounded like the soul crushing voice of a deity.This battle unexpectedly went on for several days with no sign of stopping!All the clans finally escaped back from whence they came, but their hearts were still beating incessantly. Even though a distance of over ten thousand li separated them, a dark mood loomed over them as they all felt as if an ominous event was about to occur.Three of their clan heads had perished, and they were all defeated by a single village. This news naturally shocked all the large clans. Moreover, the mountain treasure finally appeared and it was unimaginably powerful. Supreme existences were fighting over it, and their battle was even more soul-shaking.1\u201cThe land is going to go nuts. There\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d a few tribe elders muttered.\u201cHopefully the confusion would stopped soon.\u201d Many people were praying.In the far reaches of the boundless mountain range, a pure white divine object was being battered between these four supreme lifeforms. Their fierce fight never stopped as they sometimes reached out to try and grab the divine object.Hong!Chaotic mist surged up, and that pure-white divine object was knocked away flying into a distant location. It unexpectedly pierced the dense mountain valleys covered with symbols, and those ten or so precious bones were unable to lock this place down anymore.Hong!A huge beast\u2019s foot treaded outwards. It stood in place with mist curled up all around it, and is ghostly eyes swept in all four direction as it said, \u201cThis divine object is of utmost importance, the fewer the amount of people who know about it, the better!\u201d\u201cThen kill them all, starting with all the humans. Wipe all these loose-lipped humans and creatures clean,\u201d retorted the vicious bird. It also rushed out while covered in a chaotic aura. Its omnipresent wings flapped and covered the entire mountain range below. Its size was unrivaled, and with a pair of eyes like blood moons, its vicious might astonished even the heavens.Dong!\u00a0An iron rod as large as a mountain ridge stabbed outwards. It was majestically held within a huge hairy hand. This creature was also shrouded within a mist. Each swing of its iron rod contained an unrivaled divine might!A little red sparrow followed, and a blazing light covered the entire sky.Four creatures with unimaginable divine might fought and roared as they shook the entire area. The ancient precious bones were struggling to restrict the area.\u201cEvery soul listen to my commands, flatten the entire area!\u201d In the middle of the mist, a pair of ghastly green eyes increased its ice-cold intensity as the frightening, towering creature ordered.\u201cGo! Sweep everything in your path flat!\u201d That vicious bird no longer produced a beastly cry, and started using human speech. Its voice rumbled as it ordered, and those blood moon eyes were incredibly cold and terrifying.Chaotic air filled the area as that pure-white divine object bobbed up and down. It was on the verge of falling into the hands of that creature with the iron rod, and the other three terrifying existences all cried out as they charged and chased after it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ancient beasts roared, and fierce birds struck the skies; this entire area was in complete chaos!Moo\u2026A bull roared, and its voice echoed over a distance of a hundred li. Flames rushed into the heavens, and a crimson red Blood Bull with a height of over ten meters and a length of roughly thirty meters hacked open an enormous mountain. Wrapped in flaming light, It created a trail of magma as it charged outwards.This was the same Flaming Devil Bull that fought with the golden Suan Ni and had its scarlet red horn torn off as a result. It had lived for so long within this desolate land that even the elders of Stone Village heard stories about it growing up. Its four hooves were engulfed in flames, and its entire body was bathed in a blazing light. With its silky red fur flickering in scarlet light, it quickly rushed into the distance.Behind it was an inexhaustible amount of densely packed vicious beasts. They followed it outside the boundless mountain ranges, and killed everything outside while avoiding the magma and flames.\u201cAh\u2026 No!\u201dA village with a population of several hundred was in complete dismay. With so many vicious beasts charging forth with a Flaming Devil Bull in the lead who was vastly superior to their own Guardian Spirit, what could they possibly do?This village\u2019s Guardian Spirit found something was off and immediately decided to give up on the village. It didn\u2019t dare to resist, and immediately escape. In the end, it even assimilated into the beast flood, and became one of its members.This was an utter calamity. The Flaming Devil Bull charged right past it, and let alone their Guardian Spirit, even the Guardian Spirits of larger tribes were no match for it. There was simply no way for them to possibly resist its power. Their stone houses, altars and other things were thrown in the air by its big scarlet horn as it ruthless knocked away everything in its path.Smoke and dust filled the air as it headed to an even more remote region.Behind it, beasts as far as the eyes could see bore their fangs and sharpened their claws as they pounced right through. These village defended to their last breaths, however due to the scale of this beast flood, they were insignificant.\u00a0Pu pu\u00a0sounds rang out non-stop. Those big sharp claw and snow-white fangs took one life after another.This was an absolute calamity. A village was wiped out by the beast flood in the blink of an eye, and not a single survivor remained.The same scenario occurred in many other regions as well. In a brief moment, seven to eight villages in the outer regions of the boundless mountain range were instantly leveled, and only large pools of blood remained.In the far reaches of the mountain range, those two frightening existences gave the order and none of the beasts or birds dared to disobey. They charged out from the desolate lands and shed bloodbath to the entire area.In reality, a portion of these vicious birds and fierce beasts had been hindered. The little scarlet sparrow and that creature armed with the iron rod forced them to stop, otherwise, there\u2019d been even more casualties.Within Little Lonely Mountain Town, a lion with glossy fur and an entire body doused in multi-colored golden light rushed in. It unexpectedly stood on its hind legs and was over twenty meters tall. Between its brows was a large horn that flashed with rays of electricity. With a pair of blood-red eyes, it rushed into the town.\u201cHeavens, that old golden lion actually came!\u201d The townsfolk began to dread. This was an ancient beast, and many old men heard legends of it in this desolate land, but they never would have thought that it would actually come here.\u201cQuickly run!\u201dNo one could defend against this extremely terrifying descendant. With a single wave of its palm after entering the town, over seven to eight people were smashed rotten into badly mangled pieces of flesh. A claw followed and several stone houses collapsed and over ten people were crushed to death by the huge rocks.Chaos brewed in Little Lonely Mountain Town as people fled in all directions. However, they soon discovered that the little town was surrounded in every direction by vicious beasts. They had nowhere left to run to after their town was submerged in the beast flood.\u201cWhy must the heavens punish us like so?\u201d bellowed the elders towards the skies in rage.\u201cFather, save me!\u201d children wept in terror.\u2026Little Lonely Mountain Town sank into a state of panic. Doomsday approached, and many people wanted to flee for their lives. However, they soon discovered that there was nowhere to go, and so they angrily gave up all hope.\u201cOld Golden-Furred Lion, fight to the death with me!\u201d The strongest middle-aged man in the town who held a broadsword measuring half a person\u2019s body in length charged towards the shining beast.Pu!Unfortunately, he was far from being this descendant\u2019s opponent. With just a single claw, it cut both him and his sword in half, and his blood gushed high into the air.Dong!In the center of the town, that short rock mountain shook intensely. A huge glistening rock rushed out from within. Covered in dense symbols, it rapidly collided with everything in its path.Dang!The Golden-Furred Lion waved its large claw and smashed the ground. Suddenly, sparks flew in every direction and huge boulders tumbled out.Hou\u2026The beast blood drowned Little Lonely Mountain Town and a group of beasts ripped at the huge rock covered in symbols. With\u00a0keng qiang\u00a0sounds,\u00a0fragments of rock flew off. The huge rock shone with light, and a boundless strength jolted out. It continuously smashed about, and with\u00a0pu pu\u00a0sounds, it instantly turned the groups of beasts into meat paste and fresh blood.The Golden-Furred Lion released a huge roar that shook the entire town. The horn on top of its head released a bright light. A streak of lightning struck forth towards that huge rock. With a\u00a0kacha\u00a0sound,\u00a0a few streaks of cracks appeared on its body.\u201cBeing this savage and massacring the entire land, are you not afraid of punishment? I am the descendant of the Mountain Deity!\u201d The huge rock shone, and divine powers spread out.\u201cSay these things to those existences within the mountain!\u201d The Golden-furred Lion also released its divine powers. It opened its big bloody mouth and spouted out even more dazzling electricity before throwing itself towards the huge rock.Kacha!Although Little Lonely Mountain Town\u2019s Guardian Spirit resisted intensely as its symbols interweaved, it was still smashed to pieces by that Golden-Furred Lion. Glittering blood splashed outwards as the vicious beast swallowed it whole.A brief moment later, Little Lonely Mountain Town fell into ruin, and the area was filled with bloodstains and broken rubble. Everyone died and was eaten by the fierce beasts without even a trace of a bone remaining.There were vicious beasts as far as the eyes could see; doomsday struck the outer regions of the desolate lands. Under the guidance of a few powerful descendants, the beast flood massacred everywhere as they rushed toward the ends of the earth.In Stone Village, the willow tree was soundless. That tender branch shrouded the entire village in halos of gentle light. Even though the beast flood surged outwards, they stayed far away from this place.Perhaps, this was the only place that narrowly avoided the calamity.\u201cHumanity is in a terrible situation\u2026 I can only imagine how many people passed away in this disaster. I fear that the nearby villages are no longer in existence.\u201d A few elders were sighing, and sorrow hung from their faces. Struggling in this desolate land together, they sympathized with everyone in this coming disaster.They couldn\u2019t possibly have imagined that this disaster was actually several times more severe than they had thought. The chaos was no longer restricted to the area surrounding the mountain ranges, and also radiated out into the boundless earth.This day, the fresh blood of many tribes spilt over the earth. Vicious birds and fierce beasts ran amuck as they engulfed the region in disaster.In the vast mountain range, chaotic auras filled the air. Divine light rushed forth from time to time as the four supreme and powerful existences engaged in a fierce battle over the divine object.Divine fire burned half the sky and the huge bird swept the nine heavens. The fierce beast ripped apart the sky and the iron rod pierced into the heavens. The huge battle became increasingly intense!The owner of the pure-white divine object was constantly changing. The four creatures all had their hands on it at least once, but none of them could truly possess it as this intense battle continued.The ten or so primitive precious bones of the Archaic Descendants could no longer protect this mountain range together. The decisive battle of these four utmost powerful creatures caused rubbed to fly into the sky, collapsing one mountain after another into ruins.They constantly moved towards the distance as they battled. Their battles spread into the vast lands, but their power wasn\u2019t something that several thousand li of the boundless mountain range could handle.In Stone Village, the scorched black willow tree suddenly shook. The tender branch shone magnificently, causing people\u2019s heart to shake. Gorgeous multi-colored rays of light spread outwards, covering the entire village.\u201cYa, what happened?\u201d The little guy who was playing with the three hatchlings beneath the tree lifted up his head and exposed a shocked expression.Everyone inside the village trembled as if they were confronting a deity. The medical cauldron they inherited from their ancestors began to shine and resonate as the pictures of the first natives above the cauldron became more distinct.Weng! The green light of the willow tree broke into the heavens and the divine chains orderly interweaved, making people unable to open their eyes. Afterwards, it enveloped the village and suddenly disappeared from the world. Nothing else remained in this place.Its entire body was scorched black and it suffered from devastating damages. When disaster approached, it could only protect itself and could not fight against those terrifying creatures.\u201cEh?\u201dIn the far reaches of the endless mountains, a pair of ghastly green eyes within a thick mist gazed towards here. It was extremely sensitive and had a feeling as it muttered \u201cIt escaped\u2026\u201d\u201cWith this speed, who knows how many days it\u2019ll take to massacre this entire place, too slow.\u201d The vicious black bird that looked like black clouds streaked across the sky, and its blood moon eyes emitted a ruthless strength that overflowed the heavens.\u201cI loathe the humans. Their reproduction rate is astonishing. Let\u2019s do it ourselves and finish this job faster!\u201d roared the vicious beast. Its dark green eyes were filled with killing intent. It shot out two thick streaks of light as it struck towards where Stone Village was originally.Hong!The mountain range collapsed, the earth split, and smoke rushed into the heavens. A deep crater appeared where Stone Village was originally. It became a huge, deep and bottomless pitch-black dark hole.\u201cYi, there was a deity who perished here, no wonder it took root here. What a pity that I let it get away!\u201d The creature with flashing dark green eyes roared as its killing intent reached the heavens.The pure-white divine object bobbed up and down as light flowed out from it. The four great creatures continued to battle with their precious techniques. The entire endless mountain range was destroyed as there were broken mountains everywhere. Their battle extended outwards several thousand li into the vast earth.\u201cYour murderous nature is so heavy. Are you not afraid that someday that you\u2019ll receive retribution?\u201d\u201cWho can stop me?!\u201d The creature with the pair of terrifying dark green eyes roared. After it roared, all the black clouds within the sky dispersed.That vicious bird was even more straightforward. Shaking both its wings, it covered the sky. Black fog sealed the heavens, and its entire body was even larger than the black cloud. This time, it grabbed the pure-white divine object with its claws and flew outwards several tens of thousands li.The other three creatures naturally pursued closely behind and activated their most powerful attacks.\u201cI loathe the humans. I\u2019ll massacre them for you guys to see!\u201d That vicious bird released a long cry. It flapped both its wings and swept across the endless earth in an instant, and the mountains behind it disappeared in an instantVery quickly, it reached the aristocratic land of the Lightning clan whose population reached ten million. It threw down the divine object and directly massacred this entire region.Hou\u2026It was clearly a vicious bird, but it let of the cry of a beast. It opened its beak and a terrifying stream of black light shot out, covering the entire population of ten million within this aristocratic land.The Lightning clan was vast, and one huge city was laid after the other. Its population was numerous and they were very prosperous. However today, they experienced a genocide of its people.Like an avalanche flowing backwards and the vast oceans striking the sky, after this aristocratic land was enveloped in this black light, the entire population rushed into sky towards the huge open beak.This was a dreadful scenery. It was impossible to prevent, as after these ten million people were enveloped by this black light, their lives were already forfeited.If they struggled even the slightest within this black light, they would exploded into blood!\u201cHeaven Devouring\u00a0Sparrow, it\u2019s a mythical Heaven Devouring Sparrow!\u201d\u201cHeavens, how did my clan mess up to provoke this legendary devil bird into punishing us!?\u201d\u2026Cries echoed throughout the Lightning Clan. Everyone was stunned because they simply had no way of resisting.Resistance was futile, because there was no one to save them. The black light was omnipresent as it shrouded the entire region. The only thing they could see were people being swallowed into the bird beak.This was a hideous scenery. A huge vicious sparrow with a pair of eyes like bloody moons was curled up in black fog. It covered the entire sky, and as it opened its huge mouth, over ten million people were swallowed within.Pu! Pu!After these people entered its mouth, they all exploded into blood as they entered its stomach.\u201cSo much blood essence, I can be a little satisfied with this.\u201d With a huge nourishment of blood essence, this Heaven Devouring Sparrow seemed revitalized as its weary expression disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a flap of its wings, it ripped the sky apart and ran far away in the blink of an eye. Although its body was incredibly large, it was extremely nimble and possessed lightning-like speed.\u201cWhy are you so savage? Aren\u2019t you afraid of heavenly consequences?\u201d A sound transmitted out from within the mist as the iron rod swept across again.\u201cWhy does the heavens matter? God can\u2019t do anything to me!\u201d The huge body of the vicious bird filled the entire sky. It fiercely flapped its wings with the desire of shaking the world into pieces. A violent gale erupted, shrouding the entire world in darkness.This huge vicious bird was using its unrivaled demonic precious technique. Ghastly sounds echoed through the air as if it originated from the nine hells. Thick black feathers filled with innumerably dense terrifying symbols shot out and whistled through the air, and as if they wanted to destroy the world, they charged towards the creature holding the iron rod.Another intense battle began. That iron rod pierced the heaven and earth, striking against the infinite numbers of black feathers. The brilliance of its precious technique blossomed; it flipped the world upside down, making it unstable and illusory.Chi!The black light flourished as the entire sky was filled with dense black feathers. Suddenly, they all transformed into a black furnace that was larger than thousands of mountains combined. Its aura was intimidating yet majestic as it stood between the heavens and the earth. This was a Great Heavenly Earth Furnace.The Heaven Devouring\u00a0Sparrow\u2019s demonic feathers weaved, and the symbols condensed into a terrifying demonic furnace. A light\u00a0weng\u00a0sounded and it started absorbing that creature holding the iron rod.Weng!That huge creature exhaled hot air like a bull as it brandished its iron rod, and a vertical eye appeared in between its brows at the same time. Golden light flourished, and symbols filled the sky as it transformed into an immortal sword before chopping towards the furnace.This was a battle of life and death, and they finally began to use their true strength!On the other side, the scarlet sparrow was engaged in a fierce fight with that huge vicious beast with everything on the line. Flames collided against that huge claw, and the clanking sounds of the battle resonated with the heavens and the earth.They fought this great battle along the way, covering the skies and passing over the endless mountain range. Their battlefield gradually became larger and larger.On the great lands, a huge calamity befell the prosperous Lightning Clan, and they became a thing of the past. Huge cities were deserted as the tens of millions of people were swallowed by that Heaven Devouring Sparrow.The four great creatures went further and further. Wherever they brushed past, cities and walls collapsed instantly into rubble.They once controlled a great deal of territory, yet the most rich and powerful Lightning Clan was now history, and no longer ceased to exist!\u201cWithin a circumference of one hundred thousand li, not another life form would exist again. Only dyed in blood could the mountains and rivers be considered beautiful!\u201d That vicious beast shrouded in the dense mist stood between the sky and the heaven and earth. Its ghostly green eyes reflected its terrifying killing intent.It had commanded over ten thousand beasts, but now it also began to act by itself. It broke away from the little red sparrow and rushed into the distance towards the end of the horizon.\u201cHeavens, what kind of divine object is this?\u201dWithin the territory of another aristocratic land, the entire Purple Mountain Clan were shocked. They were looking at that boundless mist, and as those lake-sized green pupils closed in, they were oppressed to the point of suffocation.Xiu!A little red sparrow chased from behind with its mouth wide open. It spouted out multi-colored light that formed into a divine heavenly fire. From within the fire emerged an immortal scarlet sword, which hacked towards that vicious beast.Unfortunately, it couldn\u2019t prevent it in time. This indomitable creature\u2019s body was in the clouds as it opened up its huge mouth. It swallowed the entire region as if it was an ocean of blood.\u201cHeavens! No! What kind of vicious beast is this, how can it be so strong?\u201dThe Purple Mountain Clan was horrified. The entire capital city, along with its black mountain ridge-like walls, were ripped off of the ground. Many structures, including the palace, cracked apart, and the entire population of the clan entered within that huge bloody mouth.The little red sparrow wanted to prevent this from happening, but the humans were just too weak. Just a tiny bit of force would cause their human bodies to burst and transform into a bloody mist; this was due to the fact that everyone was within the range of this vicious beast\u2019s precious technique.A demonic light rushed into the far ends of the open earth as it engulfed every living being in its path. The tens of millions of people within the Purple Mountain Clan all flooded into the creature\u2019s bloody mouth and swallowed into its stomach.Even that powerful Guardian Spirit lacked the strength to retaliate. It exploded into bloody mist in the air as it floated into that huge beast\u2019s mouth.A genuine disaster for mankind!Purple Mountain Clan was exterminated. Apart from Zishan Hou who was in an unknown land, not a single person survived.The little red sparrow was angry. It tried to do its best to prevent harm to these innocent people, however, this vicious and violent creature was not so scrupulous. It swallowed over ten million people whole.A wind blew past, and an air of chaos permeated into every direction. Every city in this place collapsed into rubble.\u201cWithin a circumference of one hundred thousand li, whether it\u2019s humans or other creatures, as long as they\u00a0formed a tribe or clan, not a single one will remain. I\u2019ll purge them all!\u201dThe four utmost powerful creatures were struggling for supremacy. Two of them were crazy, ordering the beasts to flatten the earth and turning the territories into dust.Over ten Archaic Descendants lead the way as they ran amuck in this land. They attacked the shelters of one tribe after another and eliminated them all, turning this entire place into a river of blood.Hou\u2026A thunderous roar echoed from within this ancient tribe.A single-armed Demonic Ape with tyrannical eyes and a body enshrouded in black mist appeared, and it was as if it a demonic spirit came from the underworld. Both of its wings flapped, and like a streak of black lightning, it cut across the horizon as it dove downwards.\u201cHeavens! Archaic Descendants are invading!\u201dThis tribe wasn\u2019t considered small, and their population reached two to three hundred thousand. There wasn\u2019t a lack of experts among them. A few experts who studied the strength of the Bone Texts rushed out to help.Pu!However, before they even barely met face-to-face, their heads were instantly smashed open by the Demonic Ape. It suddenly inhaled with its mouth, and their brains were cleanly sucked into its mouth.There was no way of stopping such a powerful Archaic Descendant. Not even two to three hundred thousand people combined was enough to be its opponent. It wasn\u2019t something numbers could make up for.This tribe\u2019s Guardian Spirit, a Silver Crocodile, appeared. But after only a few exchanges, it was ripped apart by this single-armed Demonic Ape into two pieces. Silver blood bubbled outwards as it met a violent death.Not far away, a beast flood appeared and rapidly drowned this entire region. A two to three hundred thousand population tribe became a thing of the past. The ground was stained with blood as everyone became buried inside the stomachs of these beasts.The beast flood became larger and larger because as they rushed into the ends of the earth, more and more vicious birds and fierce beasts joined in. This was a magnificent sight that caused everyone to feel numb.Vicious birds and fierce beasts rebelled as they obeyed these new orders, massacring in every direction.\u201cLet\u2019s dye this entire earth in scarlet blood. I\u2019ll bring the most excellent one among you onto my divine mountain and allow you to cultivate there,\u201d roared one of the supreme creatures.With this said, there wasn\u2019t a single beast among the flood who wasn\u2019t excited. If they were allowed to follow alongside this kind of existence and cultivate where it lived, they would eventually obtain great benefits.This earth was completely filled with violent actions. The sound of roars boiled and beasts surged out like a flood as they slaughtered everything along their path.A long bird cry sounded, and a huge vicious bird flapped its wings before disappearing into the clouds. The vicious bird brought with it a densely packed group of vicious birds, and they rushed a tribe with a population of over a hundred thousand.\u201cRelease the arrows!\u201dThe tribe leader shouted, and all the warriors arced their bows toward the sky. Iron arrows ascended into skies and shot down many vicious birds.However, most of them were unaffected because the bird in charge was a terrifying Archaic Descent. It opened its mouth and symbols began to interweave into a splendid flame that covered the earth.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dBlood-curdling screeches occurred again and again within the tribe. Entire groups of people were buried within the sea of fire. Unable to resist the flames, they were cooked into ashes.Two hours later, a tribe with a population of a hundred thousand turned into dust. Vicious birds flew over the sky and scattered broken pieces of feather on top of these ruins, indicating their pain and death.\u201cWhy? Are the heavens punishing my tribe?\u201dSome people were shouting loudly as during this day, many tribes were attacked without any chance to resist. Once their Guardian Spirit was killed and their strongest experts perish in battle, their entire tribe was inevitably going to perish as well.\u201cMankind already has enough difficulty surviving. We struggle day after day in this desolate land. Why would such an extreme disaster fall upon us?!\u201dOrdinarily, fierce beasts walked all over the great earth, and vicious birds streaked across the sky; this was what humanity faced against in order to survive. They needed to struggle, they needed to fight, and there were no other ways to survive.Now, even if they struggled and fought for their lives, their tribes were still doomed to be extinguished.This was an apocalypse engulfing the great earth. Under the guidance of that Heaven Devouring\u00a0Sparrow and that indomitable vicious beast, the rivers and mountains were dyed red as entire tribes were wiped out.Destruction was eternally easier than creation. Even though the little red sparrow and that creature with the iron rod was considerate enough to prevent some of this disaster, their results weren\u2019t good. If they got a bit careless while fiercely battling against the Heaven Devouring\u00a0Sparrow and the vicious beast, mountains would collapse and cause an even greater disaster.The mountains and rivers were scarlet red as blood flowed through them.The Golden Wolf Tribe and Great Floating Pool eventually met their destruction as well. Their entire clans were left without a single survivor. As of now, the four strongest clans in this huge region were already completed extinguished, and their resting places became bloody ruins.Many other tribes followed in their footsteps and weren\u2019t able to avert the disaster, eventually resulting in the same fate. On this day, the heavens and the earth were sobbing as countless humans died under the vicious birds\u2019 and fierce beasts\u2019 sharp claws and snow white teeth.Apart from the humans, the Winged races, Tree races, as well as several other large groups also suffered from the terrifying attacks. They were wiped completely clean from this land.All the large tribes were exterminated, and the calamity rippled to an even greater distance.It was precisely as the Heaven Devouring Sparrow and that other utmost powerful creature said. Everything would be extinguished within a range of one hundred thousand li; the mountain valleys would be dyed with blood, and people cried during this doomsday.The once prosperous cities turned into ruins. Vast lands suitable for living turned lifeless as bones covered the land and blood flowed through them.No one could have avoided the current disaster because this great calamity affected the heavens and the earth. The people wailed in\u00a0anguish\u00a0as blood and disaster spread across the entire world.Hong!The life and death battle of the four utmost powerful creatures concluded after several days. Then, a curtain of silence draped over the heaven and earth.Gazing from afar, if the lofty mountain weren\u2019t collapsed, they were broke. The great land was split apart, and life could no longer be supported. The bloodstained area became a graveyard.This was the current situation, and the environment was vile and nasty. Beasts flooded the land, birds covered the sky, and poisonous bugs hid within the forests. For the sake of survival, they had to continuously resist and struggle.Today\u2019s terrible tragedy played out in every region.As the silver moon rose into the night sky, the mountains were quiet as a deathly air loomed over them. The night wind whistled mournfully across the great earth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one from Stone Village knew as they all stared blankly. How could they have suddenly left those desolate lands and from that mountain range?The little guy looked left and right within the hazy mists, and what seemed like a chaotic world loomed outside of Stone Village. There was a desolate yet ancient aura colliding against him as he walked forward; it was quite easy for a person to get lost.The thick willow tree was ingrained at the entrance of the village. The scorched black bark of the old willow was split open, and its single branch no longer seemed tender and alluring; it only emitted a dim light.What the villagers saw in front of them made them frightened. A beast flood ran through the endless mountain ranges and they suddenly detached themselves from the mountain grounds. Where did they end up? Everyone stood in front of the willow tree and piously prayed.\u201cWillow Deity used its supreme technique to help us avoid disaster.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng said. With such major events unfolding, he was naturally alarmed and came out in advance.Where they were wasn\u2019t important. The most important thing was that they were all alive.\u201cDon\u2019t get flustered. We prepared enough jerky, nuts, grain and enough dried vegetables to last several months.\u201d A village elder said.\u201cThat\u2019s right. As long as we wait patiently under the protection of the Willow Deity, we won\u2019t face any problems.\u201d Shi Linghu added.After several authoritative members of the village spoke, everyone began to calm down and no longer worried. Everyone started to handle their own affairs, such as grinding dried vegetables and taking the dried jerky off of the rooftops.In a flash, two months passed by and the little guy became four years old. His soft hair reached his shoulders and his divine black jewel-like eyes shone even brighter and lovelier. Although he looked like a little white baby, he had extraordinary strength. He became the number one expert of Stone Village, and he was able to leap thirty to forty meters away instantly.\u201cLittle guy, why are you lost in thought again? Were you drinking milk again? Quick! Come here. There\u2019s a bowl here.\u201dHe held both his knees as he sat below the willow tree. The little guy who was in a daze heard what was said and quickly stood up. His large eyes swiveled as he shouted \u201cWhere? Where?\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026. you actually were thinking about milk. We can\u2019t leave right now, so without the taste of milk in your mouth, you\u2019re being smothered now right?\u201d A group of larger kids all started laughing.The little guy was greatly embarrassed as he explained \u201cWhat\u2026 I\u2019m just asking around a bit.\u201dThe group of kids broke out into a huge laughter. The nasally kid had a rotten idea and whispered, \u201cA little child was just born into uncle Linghu\u2019s family. Little guy\u2026 if you truly want it\u2026\u201d\u201cGo away!\u201d The little guy hastily stopped him in the middle of his sentence as he stared at the nasally kid. The nasally kid was just a few months older than he was, yet had so many evil tricks up his sleeves.\u201cA gentleman uses his mouth and not his fists.\u201d The nasally kid wiped off his mucus and quickly backed off.Kacha!Suddenly, the sky split open and a ray of sunlight shone upon them, dispersing the ashen mist around them. The entire space instantly brightened up.\u201cYa,\u00a0It\u2019s daylight again!\u201d A group of kids shouted loudly and all of them let out a pleasantly surprised expression.The adults were alarmed as well, and they all stood up while gazing towards the sky in excitement. They were trapped for over two months, and their bodies were beginning to get rusty.Kacha!Like a jade vase cracking apart, the area violently shook. Then, with unceasing flickering and a final\u00a0weng\u00a0sound, the hazy ashen mist completely dissipated. The chaotic world was no longer visible as sunlight finally shined down.The sun was suspended in the sky. Although it was rather glaring, everyone was still very excited. They kept gazing towards it as they cheered. They finally escaped from that prison and arrived on the great earth again.A group of children were unable to wait any longer. They loudly cried as they rushed out of the village. They greedily breathed in the smell of plants and fresh air as they jumped up and down.\u201cYi,\u00a0something\u2019s wrong. This isn\u2019t the forest outside of our village.\u201d Er Meng was stunned. What was in front of him right now was completely different from what he had experienced as a child.A river flowed past the front of the village and large fish leapt out from within. Their golden fish scales flickered splendidly as they stirred up ripples in the river. Not far from their location was a clear and dark blue lake. A few beautiful bright-winged birds were leisurely pacing back and forth. Each of them were over two meters long as multicolored light surrounded them. Lastly, there was a group of unicorns flickering in silver while drinking from the side of the lake.\u201cWhat a beautiful scenery!\u201d The group of children were shocked as they stared in amazement.The adults were all dumbstruck as well. When they broke out from within the strange space, what was in front of their eyes wasn\u2019t the forest they were familiar with for over ten years, but a completely different one. They were surprised that they arrived at such a beautiful place.Jiu Jiu\u2026.Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing rushed out in excitement. They were salivating at the sight of the big fish in the river. Currently, their body lengths were 3.5 meters long. For the past two to three months, their growth rate had finally slowed down.The Green Scaled Eagle appeared and flapped its enormous silver wings. Waves crashed against the shore and seven to eight big golden scaled fish flopped up and down on the shore. Each of them weighed over ten jin, but what was most mystical about them was that at the side of their mouths were two sparkling dragon whiskers, and they emitted a sweet smell.The three hatchlings cheerfully rushed up to enjoy their delicious food.Shi Yunfeng was shocked and quickly followed. He held a big fish and turned it over and around several times and alarming said \u201cIt\u2019s actually a genuine Dragon Whiskered Fish? A really high quality one at that. This certainly is valuable stuff. They contain plenty of spiritual essence, so if we eat them for a long time, our strength will increase and our bones and muscles will grow strong as well. It will greatly benefit our children!\u201dA group of children heard everything and immediately shouted as they charged towards the river shore.Fish that contained such abundant spiritual essence was quite rare and very costly in the outside world. Now, there were enough of them within this lake to sustain the village for a long time.\u201cChief, look, isn\u2019t that flock of large birds beside the lake made of Five-Colored Chickens?\u201d Er Meng\u2019s father was a bit emotional as he pointed ahead. He once met one from very far away in mountains, but he wasn\u2019t able to catch it.\u201cLooks like\u2026. it actually is!\u201d Shi Yunfeng stared with his eyes wide open, and he also became emotional as soon as he saw them.Five-Colored Chickens had very gorgeous feathers. Their appearances were close to a Luan , and were all over two meters long. They could be made into a type of rare bone-repairing medicine.The Five-Colored Chicken was a divine medicine. If one fell and broke their bones or injured their muscles and ate a cauldron-full of Five-Colored Chicken as well as drank its soup afterwards, their broken bones would be repaired.Shi Yunfeng turned around and carefully warned, \u201cThere are a lot of them living here, don\u2019t rush out indiscriminately and kill them as you wish. I\u2019ll support you guys if we need its medicine. We can\u2019t startle them, as we need them to stay by this lake all year round.\u201dA group of able-bodied men all nodded in agreement because their gazes were not on the Five-Colored Chickens. Their state of mind weren\u2019t clear, and they were actually all staring toward the Unicorns on the other side. Those precious silvery mounts made their hearts beat in excitement.After living for such a long time in the middle of the mountains, all the strong males wanted a mount that could run ten thousand li a day. This was the males\u2019 dreams and wishes.Unicorns were mutated from Scaled Horses. They were extremely rare, yet there was an entire herd of them present. There wasn\u2019t any less than fifty to sixty of them, and it naturally made a bunch of old men\u2019s eyes turn red. They all knew however, that these were hard to deal with vicious beasts as well.\u201cSlowly, we will catch a few sooner or later. Don\u2019t startle them. So long as they live year round in this beautiful land, they will eventually be ours!\u201d Shi Feijiao whispered.The scenery outside the village changed greatly. After their initial shock, none of the villagers were frustrated anymore because this place was just too wonderful. They were surrounded by many rare and intelligent creatures in this beautiful and precious land.The little guy was stupidly lost in his thoughts. After seeing the Golden Scaled Dragon Whiskered Fish in the middle of the lake and those Unicorns on the shore, he became distracted as well. He muttered to himself \u201cI\u2019ve seen this place before. A large lake, and birds more beautiful and larger than these little Luan being hunted by an aristocratic tribe.\u201dSeeing him like this, Chief Shi Yunfeng\u2019s wrinkled face trembled. Even Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others\u2019 expressions changed as they looked away from those Unicorns.\u201cFather, mother, I miss you.\u201d The little guy said in a saddened voice as he sat by the lake despondently while embracing his knees.Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others looked at each other without saying much.\u201cGrandpa Chief, are they still on this earth or not? I miss them!\u201d The little guy suddenly raised his head with a watery mist in his eyes as he carefully asked. This was the first time that he was this direct.Shi Yunfeng remembered all kinds of things about the past and his heart suddenly became complex. He squatted down and rubbed the little guy\u2019s head with affection, but he did not know what to say.Suddenly, a splendid scarlet electricity streaked across the sky. It immediately dyed the entire sky red like the sunset glow.A sparkling blazing red sparrow, bright, red and alluring and only the size of a palm fell from the sky in front of the willow tree at the village entrance.\u201cYa,\u00a0Little Red!\u201d The little guy immediately stood up and rushed over.This sparrow\u2019s entire body was scarlet red, but after falling down, all of its divine light had dimmed. Its scarlet feathers darkened and a terrifying wound cut across its chest, practically splitting it in half. Furthermore, there were a few claw marks on top of its head that practically penetrated into its skull.This scarlet sparrow looked miserable, and its injuries were incredibly severe. Terrifying symbols flickered by its wounds, and they were still destroying its life force.The little guy didn\u2019t dare act prudently because after this red sparrow dropped from the sky, it immediately burned the entire ground like a frighteningly high-temperature furnace.\u201cLittle Red, what happened to you?\u201d The little guy quietly asked.The only part of the sparrow that weren\u2019t red was its two eyes as it layed on the ground, and they were distinctly black and white. They were like gems, and they blinked at the little guy with superiority. The extreme bitterness and anger it showed made the little guy scratch his head in embarrassment.Luan is a type of phoenix.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed as if it left all of the whites of its eyes for him, and seemed to have taken great offense.The red sparrow who fell from the sky left all the children stunned. Could it be that this was what was always on the little guy\u2019s mind? Was this creature the little bird that the little guy chased after until he left the village back then?However, the people who truly understood this situation, such as the Chief and some other elders, became stiff all over. Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others\u2019 hairs stood straight up and did not dare to make any movements in fear of angering the little red sparrow.They once saw from far away that a little red bird was engaged in a great battle in the endless mountain ranges, and they saw that it was able to burn up half the sky. That scene was too terrifying, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to forget it for the rest of their lives.Now, this scarlet-red bird fell from the sky, and it even dyed the horizons into a deep red, as if it was a scattering sunset. Even without thinking too much, they all felt their scalps go numb; it most likely was that supreme creature.\u201cChild, come here,\u201d said Shi Yunfeng gently. He feared that the Little Red Sparrow would feel provoked, and so he called for the little guy to return.\u201cGrandpa, there\u2019s no problem. I know Little Red is powerful, but I can\u2019t feel any killing intent from it. It does not have any animosity towards our Stone Village,\u201d explained the little guy as he blinked his big round eyes.The scarlet red sparrow leaned against the ground as it widened its eyes. It opened its mouth as it spouted out a streak of weak multi-colored light in front of a huge piece of rock. With a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, a strand of weak smoke began to burn, and the entire huge rock melted into magma.Everyone was frightened. This was merely just a tiny strand of multicolored light, and it wasn\u2019t a real flame, yet it already reached such a terrifying temperature. When one associated it with the the scene from back then where the entire skies were filled with inextinguishable flames that burned for half a month, exactly what kind of divine might was this?!Everyone was sweating because of the little guy. Shi Feijiao and the others carefully walked forward and wanted to drag him back.\u201cLittle Red, don\u2019t be angry. Look, even your head is smoking. Be careful to not burn away all your pretty scarlet feathers. Otherwise, that would be too unfortunate,\u201d said the little guy.A bunch of scarlet feathers on top of Little Red\u2019s head straightened and began to flicker with multi-colored light. Evidently, it was very angry, but after a while it calmed down. It began to continuously glare at the little guy with a bizarre gaze.\u201cGrandpa look. Little Red is very kind and is no longer angry.\u201d The little guy happily laughed sweetly and purely. He wanted to hold up this little red bird so much.The little red sparrow flapped its wings and stood up with great difficulty. Symbols flickered near the injury by its chest and continuously ate away at its life force.\u201cYou were looking for the Willow Deity right? Last time you came, you landed right in front of the tree trunk. You want it to help you heal this time right?\u201d asked the little guy.\u201cHeng!\u201d After having its thoughts read by a mere child, the Little Red Sparrow appeared to be extremely dissatisfied. It released a snort, and no longer paid attention to him; it instead raised its head and gazed towards that willow tree.The thick and scorched willow tree was quiet and soundless. That dim and carefree branch swayed back and forth. However, right now, it soundlessly reach down and emitted multi-colored green light.The little scarlet red bird began to cry out softly as it walked forward with great difficulty to face the tender green branch. It exposed its injuries and held back the last bit of its flames.A drop of sparkling jade-like liquid that emitted multicolored splendor appeared on the willow branch. Waves of fragrance spread out and made everyone inside Stone Village feel refreshed.The willow branch draped down and the tender bud touched the blazing red sparrow. The sparkling liquid rolled off the branch and onto that terrifying wound. Immediately, flames began to burn splendidly and symbols flickered non-stop. The little red bird cried out lightly and began to shudder all as it had great difficulty bearing this pain.The willow branch lightly swayed and several more drops of liquid appeared before rolling down the tender bud. Each drop sparkled all over like pearls with splendid colors, and lights flowed through them as they emitted waves of sweet fragrance.When the drops of liquid trickled down, the symbols gradually disappeared. The injury that cut across its chest completely closed, and the Little Red Sparrow\u2019s pain seemed to have been alleviated instantly.Soon after, the green tender bud touched its head and a sparkling liquid dripped down, causing those claw marks on top of the little red sparrow\u2019s head to slowly disappear. All the severe injuries that it had suffered seemed to have completely disappeared.A flaming light began to flicker, and a scarlet light began to dance splendidly all over the Little Red Sparrow\u2019s entire body. It was so dazzling that people could not open their eyes, and the boundless divine light made it appear extremely bright and beautiful, as if it was a completely different creature compared to before.The villagers were shocked. A scarlet sparrow the size of their palms was emitting such powerful divine might. Right now, it seemed as if they were facing an ancient deity. Everyone would have limped onto the ground if not for the willow tree shrouding them with light to counteract this divine power.A little further away, for example the vicinity of the lake, those Five-Colored Birds and those Unicorns seemed as if they were on a pilgrimage as they worshiped and kowtowed towards that place.The little red sparrow\u2019s was extremely cheerful again and began to lively cry out. It bounced up and down where it stood after it retracted all of its divine power. It spoke out towards the willow tree in human language, \u201cI owe a huge favor.\u201dThe scorched black willow tree did not utter a single sound. The tender green branch swayed as it pointed toward the villagers.The scarlet red sparrow was bursting with life. It swept away all of its distress and was sparkling all over. It had ample divine essence, as its vitality had already been restored.With a\u00a0qiang\u00a0sound,\u00a0a scarlet feather was shed from its body, and the multicolored light that it released looked like lightning. It was extremely mystical, and with a\u00a0chi\u00a0sound, it inserted itself into a block of stone.\u201cYou guys accept this. If somebody were to bother you, show this to them!\u201d Its voice was very pleasant and sweet like the sound of jade beads dropping onto the ground. It was obviously giving them a gift.However, after the scarlet feather was inserts into the rock, that place began to melt immediately into magma. Scarlet red rays of light flowed about as liquid began to boil while rapidly spreading outwards.Everyone took a step back in the face of this high temperature.The little red sparrow was startled and stared at everyone. It opened its mouth and began to inhale. The burning splendor on that scarlet red tail feather began to flicker intensely as strands of divine light flew into its mouth.It drew away the divine essence, and left behind only the bright scarlet feather. It then nodded towards the willow tree before flying into the heavens.\u201cLittle red! In the future, come back often to play!\u201d The little guy stood at the village entrance as he waved towards the sky with all his strength.The scarlet sparrow staggered a bit in midair and almost fell down. It turned its head around and fiercely stared at him. Then multicolored light gushed out all over its body and rushed off into the distant without even turning around.\u201cPut away this tail feather carefully!\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng solemnly said. The little scarlet feather meant a lot, and no one would treat it as an ordinary feather.This place finally calmed down after a long while. The villagers began to familiarize themselves with their new environment.A group of children were shouting loudly as they ran around the beautiful lake that was surrounded by green meadows. They discussed ways to catch those Dragon Whiskered Fish, and since they already had strong muscles, they thirsted for even more strength.The feathers of the little Luans were bright-colored, and their body lengths reached over two meters long. They leisurely swam towards the middle of the lake and did not fear the group of children at all. As for the unicorns, they were only a bit wary of the adult males of the village and did not care for the children at all.After everything calmed down again, the little guy sat on the shore by himself and held both his knees before losing himself in his thoughts again. For a long time, his large eyes looked towards the dark blue lake, and he didn\u2019t move an inch.\u201cChild, what are you thinking about?\u201d Shi Yunfeng walked over and sat on the green grass by the shore as well.\u201cGrandpa, it\u2019s about time you tell me.\u201d Shi Hao turned his head around and showed his clear expression.\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll tell you everything I know.\u201d The Chief nodded. Shi Hao was smart enough a long time ago, and it was no longer fitting to treat him as a ignorant baby.A cool breeze blew past, bringing about the refreshing fragrance of earth and grass into the air. Large golden fish leapt out from within the lake from time to time, creating a seemingly calm and peaceful atmosphere.\u201cMy Stone Village came from an astonishingly grand origin. However, even we began to quickly forget who we were, and only a few phrases of words passed on by our ancestors remain,\u201d muttered Shi Yunfeng.Stone Clan was ancient. According to the tribe elders, it could be traced back to the ancient eras. Only, after endless years, everything became blurry, and not even the villagers themselves believed those rumor anymore.\u201cSo ancient.\u201d Shi Hao was amazed.The chief lightly sighed and said, \u201cThere were so many things that even I forgot them all, and the traditions had broken off a long time ago. Only when a young couple who was searching for this placed arrived and mentioned these thing again one day did we understand that what the ancestors spoke of might actually be true.Little Shi Hao widened his large eyes. He knew\u2026 that couple could have been his parents.\u201cWhat do they look like?\u201d The villagers were very nice to them, but all the other children had parents while he was the only orphan. Although he was very carefree and optimistic, within the depths of his heart, he was still fragile and was full of incomparable longing.\u201cThe women was extremely beautiful. The man was also very handsome, but had a sickly look,\u201d said the Chief truthfully.The little guy clenched his fists, and from his brightened eyes, it was clear that he was feeling a bit happy. He had a look of anticipation as he looked up with his little face. \u201cGrandpa, quickly continue.\u201d\u201cThey came from an ancient country, and they said that Stone Village was their ancestral land. Although they were extremely prosperous, they had lost track of their ancestral land a long time ago.\u201dThis tribe was powerful beyond imagination, however due to their ancestral training, they could not return to the ancestral land whenever they wanted to. They wanted to avoid drawing their enemies here, therefore after many, many years, they eventually lost track of how to return.Their actions were for the sake of leaving behind a stick of incense; to continuously maintain their bloodline. Just in case their glorious tribe was extinguished, this place could continue to live on in this pure land.The bloodline they left behind was incredibly powerful, however, due to mishaps here and there, Stone Village gradually declined. Now, the cultivation methods had already been lost for a long time.\u201cThe couple during that time accidentally found the path that returned them to their ancestral land, so they arrived here.\u201dThat couple was incredibly powerful. They crossed the great desolate land and treaded past endless territories until they had finally arrived. However, they were disappointed because Stone Village was far from the powerful and prosperous place they had imagined it was, and it had already lost all the might it had from the ancient times.\u201cThat time, they carried you here. You were very feeble when you arrived and seemed to have been only a few months old. However, they said you were already one year old.\u201dThe little guy widened his eyes and listened carefully. At this time, a group of children ran up and sat on the floor without muttering a word as they listened earnestly.\u201cThe condition of your body was extremely bad, and you were suffering from a serious illness. They asked us to raise you as if you were only a few months old, and if you truly couldn\u2019t survive, then they wouldn\u2019t blame us.\u201d The chief sighed and patted the little guy\u2019s head. Not even he could have thought that a child this feeble could live, moreover becoming the heavenly gifted genius he was today!The little guy had a distracted expression on his face. A cloudy mist appeared within his mind. A child that young shouldn\u2019t have been able to recollect what happened when he was one year old, but this memory was deeply ingrained into his unconscious mind, and it left its mark.\u201cThey\u2026 relatives, to help my older brother, I\u2026\u201dWhile he was distracted, the little guy appeared to have seen something, and he couldn\u2019t help but weep in sorrow. His tears slid down his cheeks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the image was inarticulate, it still made his heart ache. He tried his best to see the ending, but a fog rolled over and he could no longer see anything.At that time, he was still too young, and it was impossible to have retained any clear memories from back then. It was only a memory carved deeply into his subconscious mind, and it only appeared when he was truly emotional.\u201cChild, don\u2019t cry. Everybody within this village is your close relative, this is your family.\u201d Shi Yunfeng used his rough hands to wipe away the tears on his little face.\u201cLittle guy, don\u2019t cry. We are all your brothers. Don\u2019t think unhappy thoughts,\u201d shouted the group of children as they gathered around him.Little Shi Hao wiped away his tears and said, \u201cGrandpa, continue talking.\u201d\u201cNothing much happened afterwards. Your parents did not say much more.\u201d Shi Yunfeng explained what happened during the past.That couple took care of Shi Hao within Stone Village for a couple of months, and after making sure that he would survive, they left. At that time, the feeble Shi Hao was a year and few months old, yet he looked like a child who was only half a year old.\u201cThey don\u2019t want me anymore\u2026\u201d Tears dripped from little Shi Hao once again as his big eyes began to tear up again.\u201cNo!\u201d Shi Yunfeng shook his head and said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to, but they had to leave. They wanted to permanently stabilize your condition, so they went out to search for the holy medicine.\u201dPi Hou scratched his head and quietly said, \u201cThat time, I was still young, but I still have some memories. That uncle was very heroic, but he carried a sickly expression. However that auntie was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.\u201d\u201cMy impression was comparatively deeper. The little guy lost his parents when he was half a year old, and they disappeared around that time.\u201d Shi Dazhuang nodded.Although a few years had passed, the couple were sad and reluctant to depart. The old chief still remembered clearly and said, \u201cYou were their only child. If they said anything, they would die. They couldn\u2019t bear to see you continue on so feebly.\u201dLittle Shi Hao\u2019s tears endlessly dripped out of his eyes. He called out, \u201cFather, mother, where are you?\u201dThe chief told him everything that happened that year, and the little guy\u2019s heart lightened up a lot. The couple that arrived that year was extremely powerful, but they didn\u2019t mention much about the ancient country they\u00a0came from, because they weren\u2019t clear about many of the things.The couple went to find the holy medicine, and naturally, they had to tread into the most dangerous ancient lands. They had to travel to the Divine Archaic Mountain, and there was a high chance that a True Hou was guarding it. If they actually found one, many Archaic Descendants would be attracted to it, causing them to fight over it.\u201cWillow Deity, can you help me see clearly what is in my subconscious mind?\u201d When he was alone, little Shi Hao quietly said this in front of the tree, and he was extremely hopeful.\u201cI am about to sink into deep hibernation. Wait until you grow up a bit when your blood essence becomes more powerful, maybe a year or two later.\u201d What was extremely astonishing was that the willow tree actually responded.\u201cAlright!\u201d The little guy widened his eyes. He was filled with hope as he clenched his little fists. He was no longer heartbroken, and he needed to figure out what his body\u2019s condition was like back then, as well understand where his parents went. These were his clear goals.The villagers found that this place was very suitable for living. There weren\u2019t many beasts that were too vile and vicious, and the forests in the distance had many prey. Although many vicious birds and fierce beasts lived there, they weren\u2019t that tough to deal with.Within the lake lived all the types of fish one could think of. The Dragon Whiskered Fish, in particular, could create truly precious medicine, and the villagers couldn\u2019t help but laugh in amazement. In the old days, even the Purple Mountain Clan, Lightning Clan and the Golden Wolf Tribe could not enjoy such precious strength boosting fish luxuriously like they did on a daily basis.\u201cWe should go to the outer world to find out exactly what kind of place this is. We need to see just how far away this place is from that boundless mountain range as well as exactly what happened to our original living area,\u201d Shi Linghu said.\u201cUncle, let me go. I\u2019ll follow aunt Green Scaled Eagle for a careful look.\u201dIn the envious eyes of a group of children, the little guy climbed onto the back of the Green Scaled Eagle. With a flap of its wings, wind whistled and they skyrocketed into the clouds.Vicious birds were extremely sensitive of their directions. It spiraled in the air and very quickly found a direction to fly towards. Like a streak of silver lightning, its speed was extremely fast.\u201cYa.\u00a0What happened? How did these mountains collapse?\u201d Little Shi Hao was shocked. After flying out for several hundred li, he discovered the strange events that occurred on the great earth.The earth cracked, and death filled the air. Mountains and rivers had completely collapsed, and they were no longer fit to sustain life.Following deeper, he saw broken walls and ruins. Huge cities were destroyed one after another, becoming ruins. Blood stained everything, however no skeletons were found.After a few thousand li, they did not discover a single trace of humanity, only blood. Many huge tribes were destroyed, and these boundless territories transformed into a graveyard.\u201cThere\u2019s a giant footprint!\u201dThey were high up in the clouds as they gazed down towards the great earth, yet he could clearly see that there was a huge footprint. It left its mark on a mountain range, and smashed apart many mountain peaks.The little guy trembled at the thought of how huge that creature must have been.After flying a bit further, a few deep dark holes appeared on the ground. They were incredibly huge, but after careful observation, they could see that they were actually claw prints dug out by a vicious bird\u2019s claws.\u201cThis vicious bird\u2026\u201d Little Shi Hao was dazed.The Green Scaled Eagle only trembled within the depth of its soul, and it had a feeling of reverence towards the supreme creature. They were both birds, but the gap in power was extremely large.Travelling a bit farther, scarlet land covered a thousand li of the desolate land. Entire mountains had been melted and burned flat.\u201cCould this be the result of what Little Red was\u00a0forced to do?\u201d The little guy muttered to himself.The Green Scaled Eagle was very intelligent, and it spiraled for a long time above this battlefield. It understood the details of the battle between the supreme creatures, and it gained many insights. Moreover, the scars of the battle were left by bird creatures, so it was very beneficial for it.\u201cAunt Green, after Zi Yun, Da Peng and the others learn to fly, I\u2019ll accompany them here to have them comprehend this as well,\u201d the little guy said.The Green Scaled Eagle responded with a long cry to show its appreciation for the little guy\u2019s intelligence and benevolence.Travelling a bit further, the endless mountain range collapsed. Many of them were swept flat by various creatures. This was an extremely terrifying scene of over a thousand broken lofty peaks.After half a day\u2019s time, they traveled quite a distance along their route. The Green Scaled Eagle turned back to avoid any accidents, as the remains of a battle could be hiding some huge unexpected dangers.They returned when the sun set. They travelled for a long distance and the Green Scaled Eagle flew for an entire day. Although it was the descendant of the Archaic Devil Bird, it was still a bit exhausted.\u201cAoooo\u2026 Aunt Green Scaled Eagle returned!\u201d clamored a group of children.\u201cChild, what did you find out? What is this place? How far is it from the boundless mountain range?\u201d asked Shi Feijiao. A huge group of people including a few village elders surrounded him. All the villagers were very concerned about this matter.\u201cI know how far this is from our original place. I think it would be at least 50000 li. The entire earth was beaten up and the mountain collapsed\u2026\u201dThe little guy explained everything he had seen along the way, and everyone who was present was overwhelmed with shock.\u201cIt was a calamity\u2026 No wonder the Willow Deity brought our Stone Village away!\u201d The chief sighed. He knew that if it were not for the willow tree, Stone Village would be razed to the ground, and not a single person would remain. The bitter scenery of the great earth completely explained everything.During the following month, the little guy would head out with the Green Scaled Eagle sometimes. They sometimes disappeared for many days, and they finally understood the entire situation.\u201cGrandpa chief, over a thousand li of the boundless mountain range were completely broken. I can\u2019t even find our original home.\u201d The little guy brought some news that stunned everyone.A circumference of 100000 li, and not a single trace of life remained. Even those fierce beasts and omnipresent vicious birds disappeared without a trace. Perhaps they were also devoured by those supreme creatures.100000 li of territory became a graveyard without a single form of life remaining; they were all exterminated!\u201cWhat a disaster. The Lightning Clan, Purple Mountain, Great Floating Pool, Golden Wolf Tribe were all huge tribes. Their aristocratic lands contained over ten million people. How could they just disappear?\u201d A few village elders couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Although they were once enemies and disheartening things happened between them, in face of such a calamity, those grudges didn\u2019t mean much. All those huge tribes put together had hundreds of millions of people, yet they all died. This was a loss that terrified the heavens!\u201cGet stronger!\u201d\u201cWe need to get stronger. Only then, can we protect our home!\u201dA group of children shouted out. This kind of tragedy shook them to the core, but it also evoked their inner fighting spirit. All of them shouted out that they wanted to become stronger.\u201cRight, we need to start now and earnestly cultivate the Bone Text. Recently, a circumference of one hundred thousand li became barren. Perhaps we can make it our own country,\u201d a few older children stated.\u201cTheir dreams aren\u2019t small, but it\u2019s too difficult. The reason those ancient countries were able to pass on their inheritance until now was due to their ancient deities still being alive, as well as the fact that they were rather powerful themselves. Any random family from those ancient countries could exterminate clans like the Golden Wolf Tribe or the Great Floating Pool. From the ancient era until now, the everlasting ancient countries were simply incomprehensible in power.\u201d The chief sighed.\u201cDon\u2019t fear, we have the Willow Deity. When we\u2019re older, we will all be stronger. The little guy right now is a genius comparable to an Archaic True Hou, how can it be that we can\u2019t make a large country in the future?\u201d The group of children were unconvinced, and they all clenched their fists.\u201cGood, I\u2019ll wait for you guys to create your own brilliant country. According to the words of the elders, during the ancient era, our tribe was extremely powerful. We had an ancient deity once that was on par with\u00a0a genuine Archaic Descendant. I hope as well that you guys can one day restore us to our former glory, and make our so called ancestral land able to shake the entire earth!\u201d said Shi Yunfeng as he patted the heads of this group of children as encouragement. For a boy to strive for self-improvement, they needed a big dream.During the following month, the children of Stone Village were all vigorously striving to improve themselves. They bitterly studied the Bone Text and trained their blood essence. Every one of them was as strong as a vicious beast.This living area was rich with resources. Apart from the Dragon Whiskered Fish, the villagers also discovered Dragon Tendon Snakes. Although it was an extremely vicious snake, they were still able to hunt it. Its tendons could be used as an extremely precious medicine that upon consumption, one could significantly improve their physique.Not only were the children growing up really fast, even the adults gained incredible benefits. They were strong up to the point that they could never exhaust their energy.Time past by quickly and in an instant, a year went by. If one were to use his original age, then the little guy was a bit past five years old, but in reality, if the \u201clost\u201d time of several months counted, he was six years old.\u201cI am six years old now and I can lift a thirty thousand jin rock now. Willow Deity, when will you wake up?\u201dThe little guy lightly spoke in front of the large willow tree. He grew a lot taller, and his eyes were flashing with intelligence. He grew even prettier and appeared even more handsome now.Jiu jiu\u2026.Bird cries echoed in the sky. Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing did not grow very fast. Their bodies were about four meters long now. However, they could already spread their wings into the skies and break into the clouds extremely quickly.\u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming to help you guys study the battlefield!\u201d Shi Hao waved his hand and then fiercely stamped his feet on the ground before jumping into the sky and stably landing on Zi Yun\u2019s back.Wu wu\u2026A violent wind whistled past and in the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the horizon towards that lifeless earth in the distance.These were collapsed valleys, cracked earths and toppled mountains; it was an incredibly desolate and quiet atmosphere.\u201cThis time, we should change our direction towards the west.\u201d After they entered the battlefield, Shi Hao pointed towards a collapsed mountain in the west.The sound of wind whistled past as they travelled quickly. Soon after, they arrived in this toppled mountain range, and they carefully looked for the remnants of the battle.Jiu jiu\u2026\u00a0Xiao Qing cried out and rushed towards a huge depression in the ground. Its stripes shined brightly because after eating the Suan Ni meat, he transformed along with Da Peng.\u201cYi,\u00a0it\u2019s not a depression, this is a huge lake. Only that during that world-shaking battle, it dried up.\u201d The little Shi Hao was amazed.Suddenly, Zi Yun also cried out and indicated that there was life below.Da Peng, who had dim golden rays of light flowing about it, dove down a huge distance and spiraled about the dried lake.\u201cWhat kind of creature is that?\u201d The little guy was astonished.At the bottom of the dried up lake, there was a creature who laid inside. Its entire body was covered in soil and it remained motionless. It seemed like it had been gathering dust for many years. If not for its shining eyes, it would have truly made people doubt whether or not it was alive.\u201cYa,\u00a0it\u2019s a monkey who is only a foot long. It\u2026 why does it have three heads and six arms?!\u201d Shi Hao was amazed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looked like a monkey, but at the same time it seemed like it wasn\u2019t. What kind of creature was this? The little guy began to be doubtful and apprehensive; no creature within a circumference of one hundred thousand li survived, so how could this kind of strange creature have survived? It\u00a0definitely wasn\u2019t simple.The huge lake was dried up, and even the mud at the bottom had solidified into rocks. This creature had a leg buried underneath\u00a0the mud. It seemed like it was sealed within the rock and was\u00a0unable to\u00a0pull it out.The surrounding mountains were all broken, as if someone used a huge tool to flatten the area. All the mountains were destroyed to the point that only\u00a0half the mountains remained.This large lake also dried up due to the violent transformations of these mountains, becoming\u00a0lifeless. It could never again contain\u00a0waves that reached the sky or be the vast body of water it had once been.The three young birds spiraled. Sometimes they would rush into the clouds, and sometimes they would hover near the bottom of the empty lake. The little guy sat on Zi Yun\u2019s back and stared downwards. Then, he grabbed some food from his beast skin bag and threw it downwards.This creature looked like it was starving. It picked up the dried meat by its side and ravenously devoured it in a few bites. Then, it expressed that it wanted more by raising its head towards the sky.\u201cThis creature\u00a0doesn\u2019t seem dangerous, but it is a bit strange. Zi Yun, descend a bit further so I can have a better look,\u201d said little Shi Hao.Zi Yun dove down and spiraled within the dried lake. The little guy\u2019s arms shined and symbols appeared. He drizzled down a large rain of light onto that creature.The\u00a0figure that looked like a foot long monkey widened its eyes. It was a bit nervous and puzzled. The rain of light poured over, making its body sparkling and translucent.This was a technique that used the Bone Text to probe its opponent\u2019s status. The little guy let out a surprising cry on the spot and said, \u201cIt\u2019s suffering from a great injury. There are complicated symbols within its body that are almost gone. I can\u2019t see the rest properly since it is being blocked by a mysterious power.\u201dAfter he ascertained that there were no dangers, little Shi Hao leapt down and landed on the ground. The three young birds gently\u00a0cried and spiraled in mid-air. Their entire bodies lit up and they waited on the side as they were prepared to fight at any time.\u201cThis lake has been dry for over a year. Could it have been trapped here without anything to eat or drink?\u201d The little guy was astonished.The bottom of the lake was as hard as a mountain rock. This foot long creature had silkworm-like skin, and there were\u00a0portions of it that had just\u00a0been\u00a0shed off in front of it.\u201cCould it be that it underwent\u00a0some type of transformation, and only finished just now? After being covered\u00a0up in mud, it must have been sealed for at least a year of two.\u201d Shi Hao said with\u00a0a surprised expression.\u201cZhi zhi\u2026\u201d\u00a0The three headed, six armed creature lightly howled. Its six arms waved together towards Shi Hao, hinting that it wanted something to eat.The little guy opened his bag and handed over some more dried meat before\u00a0asking, \u201cWhat kind of creature are you, and why are you trapped here?\u201dThe little foot long monster stared with its perfectly round eyes. It wolfed the food down as it pondered, and in the end it revealed a blank expression. While pondering, it realized that it actually forgot to eat, and began to rub its head with all of its strength. It seemed to be extremely angry as if\u00a0it was extremely unsatisfied with itself.\u201cYa, you\u2019re actually transforming. Another chunk of your old skin just fell off.\u201dThis creature\u2019s old skin stuck to the hard and dry mud. After some of the old skin shed off from its arms, it unexpectedly exposed new and shining\u00a0fur. The fur was brilliant and splendid like golden silk, and it was much more pleasing to the eye than the muddy old fur it previously had.It was extremely weak, and after coming to, it didn\u2019t even have the strength to free its sealed leg. In addition, it was grabbing its ears and scratching its cheeks while trying hard to recall something.The little guy was curious. His palms shone, and a rain of light once again drizzled out onto its body.Zhizhi\u2026\u00a0It immediately began to scream out, and it seemed to be terrified. Its whole body became sparkling and translucent, and the complex broken symbols inside\u00a0it flickered. The symbols wrapped itself around the creature, and it was no longer possible to examine it.\u201cCould it be that you suffered a serious injury, and in order to survive, you had to\u00a0undergo a transformation?\u201d Shi Hao watched and felt that this creature was seriously injured.Kacha!This monkey shaped creature suddenly shined brilliantly all over. Its entire body cracked and the sound of snapping echoed through. All of its old skin fell off, exposing its real body.Furthermore, during the process, its three heads and six arms became indistinct, and rapidly transformed into an ordinary appearance with one head and two arms.\u201cYa,\u00a0a transformation. Could that just have been a precious technique?!\u201d The little guy was amazed.After shaking off the old skin and retracting the precious technique, its entire body glittered. It struggled and freed that sealed leg. It shrieked incessantly and it became even smaller. It was now only three inches tall.This was too shocking. How could there be such a huge change? It looked like a completely different creature took its place. It was plump like a golden fist, and could be rolled around\u00a0like a golden ball.It still looked like a monkey, but it became golden, round, and fist-sized. It had a pair of spirited large eyes that were as large as Shi Hao\u2019s, and each time it blinked, sparkling rays of light would shine.\u201cSo cute!\u201d The little guy cupped it in the\u00a0palm of his hands right away. He pinched and rubbed it, making\u00a0golden light flow out.Zhi zhi zhi\u2026 The golden ball tried to struggle free. It widened its large eyes and shrieked non-stop.Zhi\u2026 wu! The little guy directly stuffed a piece of dry meat into its mouth and it immediately stopped shrieking. It looked like a reincarnated demon that was starving. It held the food in its palms and rolled around as it nibbled quickly.Shi Hao grabbed the monkey\u2019s tail, but this ball of gold seemed\u00a0unaffected. It allowed its body to be\u00a0suspended there while holding and nibbling on its food,\u00a0completely ignoring him.The little guy immediately smiled. He was extremely happy, and he was having the time of his life as he fiddled and rolled it around back and forth.Finally, the ball of gold became angry, however,\u00a0it wasn\u2019t because it was being played around with, but rather\u00a0because it ate all its food. He found that the little guy wasn\u2019t paying attention and didn\u2019t continue feeding it.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The little guy happily laughed and handed over another piece of dry meat. The result was that the ball of gold didn\u2019t care about anything else again. Whether he lifted it up and rubbed it around, or swung it by the tail, it didn\u2019t care at all. It simply allowed itself to be played with, and used its pair of claws to hold the food while engrossing itself in nibbling.Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing were all stunned. They descended and stared at that ball of gold and showed an expression of surprise. Just a moment ago, this creature had the appearance of three heads and six arms due to the effects of a legendary precious technique. Although this made them very nervous, right\u00a0now this ball of gold was acting like nothing else mattered as long as it had food.After finding this creature, they naturally couldn\u2019t go and obtain insights from the battlefield now. The little guy grabbed the golden ball\u2019s tail, sat on Zi Yun\u2019s back, and charged towards Stone Village.Wu\u2026\u00a0Strong winds surged. The three young birds descended onto the grass by the lakeside. A group of children surrounded them with a look of surprise on their faces.\u201cWhat is this, a newborn monkey? Why does it look like it was forged out of gold with such shiny and dazzling fur?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so round. If you put it on the ground, it would probably roll.\u201d\u201cWow. It can eat so much. Even if you pull its tail, it wouldn\u2019t get angry. It only knows how to immerse itself in nibbling.\u201dThe beautiful lake was a clear dark blue, and green grass decorated the shore like cushions. In the distance, a few big, beautiful, and brightly-colored feathered birds paced back and forth. Sometimes, incredible beasts would appear.A group of children formed a circle on the grass and stared at the creature, laughing from time to time.Its mouth never stopped and finally, the golden ball directly dug into the little guy\u2019s beast skinned bag. Unexpectedly, it ate an entire bag of dried meat, and only at this moment did the children feel that something was strange.\u201cHeavens, it\u2019s only the size of a fist. How can it eat such a large bag of food? How can its belly fit all of that?\u201cWhat kind of monkey is this?\u201dThese alarming cries drew the attention of the adults, causing Shi Feijiao and the other adults to walk over.\u201cIt\u2019s not a monkey. It underwent some transformation. When I found it at first, it had three heads and six arms, but it shed its skin like a golden cicada\u201d explained the little guy.\u201cWhat! Three heads and six arms? That\u2019s a supreme precious technique only heard of in legends!\u201d Shi Feijiao was shocked. During these past few years of cultivating with the chief, he learned many mysterious things.\u201cWhat a pity. It almost died and the symbols within its body broke.\u00a0The technique can no longer be researched.\u201d The little guy was regretful.At this moment, several older clan elders were startled. The words \u201cthree heads and six arms\u201d made the elders distracted. Chief Shi Yunfeng also came over, and he crouched down while he carefully observed.Zhi zhi\u2026\u00a0The ball of gold was angry and never stopped shrieking because it ran out of food.With a\u00a0pa\u00a0sound, a\u00a0child threw down a red fruit from\u00a0its hands, and then the creature became obedient again. It held up its butt and immersed itself in nibbling, allowing everyone do whatever they wanted to it.\u201cThis thing isn\u2019t simple!\u201d The chief took a quick look and jumped back in fear, showing a serious expression.\u201cChief, what kind of monkey is this?\u201d some children asked.\u201cThis isn\u2019t an ordinary monkey.\u201d Shi Yunfeng explained as he lifted up its two small legs and carefully observed. Everyone else followed in observing and were surprised to find that both its feet were scarlet-colored like burning charcoal. If one didn\u2019t look carefully, it would have been hidden beneath its golden fur. One could only find that its feet were extremely bright-red like the color of fire if they lifted up its golden fur.\u201cIs it actually something from legends?!\u201d The chief trembled with shock like he was face to face with a peerless terror.\u201cGrandpa chief, what is it?\u201d\u00a0asked little Shi Hao.\u201cIn an ancient legend, there was a peerless vicious beast named Zhuyan. It was shaped like a monkey with scarlet feet and a white head. Its appearance foretold which place would end in chaos.\u201dEveryone jumped in fear and couldn\u2019t help but take a step back. How could this golden monkey be so fearsome?\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 an archaic vicious beast?!\u201d Everyone\u2019s hearts were thumping violently. This was a bit scary. Unless a deity came, who could handle an Archaic vicious beast?\u201cWrong. Its head isn\u2019t white,\u201d the nasally kid said.\u201cNaturally, it can\u2019t be an archaic vicious beast. It should be a descendant, and its blood perhaps isn\u2019t pure. We don\u2019t know why it suffered such a serious injury,\u201d the chief said.With this, everyone became fearful. Even without the purest of blood, as long as it could be called an Archaic Descendant, it could still rampage through the desolate lands like a terrifying creature.The only thing that relieved the people was the fact that\u00a0this golden ball seemed\u00a0harmless. It was just a food whore without much dangers to it.In addition,\u00a0it also suffered a heavy injury that shattered the symbols within its body.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the supreme legendary precious technique was broken as well.\u201d After calming down, the group of people all felt very regretful.\u201cYi,\u00a0there\u2019s a horn on its head.\u201d The little guy rubbed its head. Not only did he not find any white hair, he actually found a pair of little protrusions inside its golden fur.He only found it after careful examination: a\u00a0pair of little protrusions stuck out of its fur as they radiated and flickered.\u00a0They only found out it was a pair of horns after close examination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stay still for this old woman!\u201d A big burly woman chased a fist size ball of gold holding a hundred jin beast leg within the village. It escaped in a way that seemed like it was rolling on the ground while also rapidly nibbling at the food during its escape.What made this unbelievable was that it was only three inches tall; however, by the time it escaped to the village entrance, that hundred jin of smoked meat all went into its stomach with only a bone remaining.\u201cDamn monkey, can\u2019t you go to another family. This is the sixth time in half a month!\u201d The middle-aged woman shouted like a lion, took the half meter long bone and directly whacked its head.Dang,\u00a0sparks flew everywhere like iron striking against a rock. A look of innocence loomed over this golden ball\u2019s face. Its eyes were wide open, and it wasn\u2019t retaliating, nor responding.\u201cAunt Hu, it\u2019s not a monkey, it\u2019s a Zhuyan,\u201d the little guy corrected and then he picked up the golden ball and carried it backwards by the tail.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s also very annoying. I hate it more than pigs!\u201d The middle-aged woman was still angry. She used the big bone to whack its head again, but it was as useless as trying to hit metal.\u201cLittle Zhu, for the past half month, you stole from the entire village. Is your little stomach still not full?\u201d Shi Hao pulled its ears several times.\u201cZhi! Zhi!\u201d\u00a0the golden ball protested in dissatisfaction to the nickname.\u201cNot Tree Pig\u2019s Zhu, it\u2019s Zhuyan\u2019s Zhu . If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll call you hairy ball.\u201d Little Shi Hao laughed as he let it roll around his palm.The golden Zhuyan was extremely angry. What kind of nicknames were these. It was very displeased since it was either a pig or a ball.Shi Hao pinched and rubbed it all over. In the middle of the Zhuyan\u2019s protest, they arrived by the lake and prepared to cultivate.A group of children had gathered here in a circle on the grass a long time ago. They were all very serious in bitterly cultivating the Bone Text. After a huge battle, everything within a circumference of one hundred thousand li was extinguished. This stirred the children\u2019s fighting spirits and made them strive to become stronger.\u201cHairy ball got into trouble again right? I just heard Linghu family\u2019s aunt Hu roaring like a lion.\u201d\u201cHaha, when does it not get into trouble? It\u2019s really puzzling how it can eat so much; its stomach is like a bottomless pit.\u201dThe group of children got up and smiled as they circled over. They pinched the spherical body of the Zhuyan since it was very comforting to touch.\u201cThis past half month, it must have stolen smoked meat in the weight of a Dragon-Horned Elephant already right?\u201dThe little guy heard and nodded. \u201cIt could just be really hungry. It was sealed under the lake for over a year without anything to eat or drink. It must be recovering its energy right now.\u201dThe jade lake was crystal clear and sometimes a big golden fish would leap out of the water. The group of children sat in a circle by the lake again and continued cultivating.For the past year, Shi Hao\u2019s strength advanced leaps and bounds like a butterfly breaking out of its cocoon. Just by using his flesh, he could already lift a huge thirty thousand jin rock. He was only a six year old child when he did it, and the entire village was amazed.Furthermore, he was still cultivating in the essence of the Bone Text and had already gained extremely profound knowledge of it. With this speed of growth, it\u2019s hard to imagine what kind of stage he will reach!Actual cultivation didn\u2019t just include refining the human body; it also involved understanding the primitive symbols to tap into the strength of heaven and earth. Otherwise, no matter how strong one\u2019s body is, it\u2019s hard to step onto the peak.Actual Divine Beings didn\u2019t differentiate between the flesh and the Bone Text. While they were\u00a0refining their corporeal body, they could create traces of mysterious power to break them down to be absorbed by their body. This was done by transforming the Bone Text into divine light to nourish blood and body and refine it like a furnace when practicing.Then humans began to become aware of this. As soon as they started, they tried to combine as much of the Bone Text and the corporeal body as possible and cultivated both as a whole.Naturally, this road was\u00a0very challenging. In a village of several hundred people or even a town of several thousand, it was tough to find even one person who can walk the path of cultivation.The realm of Blood Transformation is the genuine first stage of the path of cultivation. Under normal circumstances, one person out of ten thousand people who achieved this in a tribe would already be lucky considering the difficulty of walking this path.This realm required circulating all the blood essence within one\u2019s body, roiling it like thunder, refining the Bone Text, and emitting divine light from one\u2019s own blood to achieve the refinement of heavenly and earthly fortunes to nourish the body.Simply put, the realm of Blood Transformation is combining blood and symbols and transforming them into divine light to nourish the corporeal body; to seize the fortunes of heaven and earth in order to strengthen the body and achieving the goal of cultivation.The initial stages of Blood Transformation already had an astonishing destructive capability. One could easily suppress Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao or other people who had five to six thousand jin of godly strength with a wave of their arms.If one really wanted to measure this with numbers, the initial stages of the Blood Transformation realm had a destructive force of at least eight thousand jin!The little guy also absorbed symbols into his flesh and blood to create divine light. Only after attaining an eternally burning furnace constantly supplying him with the divine essence of heaven and earth did he truly step into the realm of Blood Transformation.People as strong as Shi Linghu or Shi Feijiao were not in this realm either because it was truly too difficult. If one person within a tribe with ten thousand people could pass this threshold, it was really good already.Mid stage of the Blood Transformation realm had a destructive power of twenty thousand jin and the late stage was even more shocking: able to explode with fifty thousand jin of divine strength. This strength allowed people to push and shove their way through a group of huge beasts.Even if a tribe had several tens of thousands of people, and a few were able to step into the Blood Transformation realm, in the end it would be extremely difficult for them to reach the late stages to able to utilize such shocking strength.The little guy was only six, but with only the strength of his flesh, he could already lift thirty thousand jin. If one added the mysterious force of the symbols to his flesh and blood, he would be even more amazing, practically be considered at the apex of the Blood Transformation realm.In the past two years, Shi Hao advanced at lightning fast speed. Shi Hao had already read all the bone books that the chief had gathered and his comprehension was incredibly profound. He already reached the extreme limit of his refinement, and was at a point where he was ready to break into the next realm.However, Shi Yunfeng did not let him to do so because the little guy\u2019s cultivation speed was too fast. It was unbelievable that at such a young age, he already reached a point where many people couldn\u2019t for their entire lives. He felt that he needed to let Shi Hao establish a better foundation first, and that it was better to wait for the recovery of the Willow Deity and listen to its suggestion.During these past few days, the little guy had flipped the pages of the bone book rotten, and he had completely mastered all the symbols within. He didn\u2019t have much to study anymore, and the only thing he could do was to experiment around and research slowly.Additionally, he was also researching precious techniques. One of them was the primitive symbols of the Archaic Devil Bird, and the other was the Suan Ni\u2019s divine powers. Both of them were able to make a tribe with a population of ten million\u2019s eyes red with envy.When the sun was about to set and the sunset glow dyed the horizon red, the lake appeared even more gorgeous. A group of birds frolicked on the water until they were suddenly thrown into chaos. All of the huge birds flapped their wings and cried out incessantly.Within the water, an egg that was the size of a human head rolled at an incredible speed. One could see it was being dragged by a hairy golden ball from far away.A group of children looked dumbstruck. The golden Zhu Yan stole an egg of the vicious birds. Those several meter long Scarlet-Feathered Cranes which were fiery red colored all over were angrily crying out non-stop.\u201cHairy ball, although this type of egg is very sweet after cooking, it\u2019s not considered a good medicine. Go and take some of those little Luan\u2019s eggs from their nest. Those are the good stuff.\u201d The nasally kid instigated. Although he wasn\u2019t very big, he was pretty naughty.\u201cZhi! Zhi\u2026\u201d\u00a0Hairy Ball cried out. It became a streak of golden light and suddenly disappeared with a\u00a0whoosh. Its speed was too quick!By some grass at the lakeside, a group of little Luan were angrily chirping soon afterwards. They fluttered their wings and splashed out big ripples of water to relieve their rage within their hearts.The efficiency of the fist-sized ball was extremely high. In a short amount of time, it stole over 20 eggs. If Shi Hao didn\u2019t restrain it, it would have continued.\u201cSo sweet!\u201d The children raised a fire and cooked the bird eggs by the lakeside to enjoy the delicious food with Hairy Ball.Although there weren\u2019t that many eggs, they were very fresh cultivation medicine. They ate to their heart\u2019s content, but were worried all over. The golden Hairy Ball was not hogging all the food as well and happily shared.However, its large eyes kept rolling around and had already started pondering which of these children\u2019s family it would visit next. It couldn\u2019t just steal eggs for them for nothing right?The night descended and the willow tree at the village entrance suddenly emitted a shroud of light that enveloped Stone Village like it did in the endless mountain ranges every night.The hibernation that it was in for the past year had only ended just now.\u201cWillow Deity recovered!\u201d the villagers cried out in alarm.At this moment, all the golden hair on the Zhu Yan\u2019s body were erect and it stared nervously yet tenaciously at the lustering green branch of the scorched black willow tree with its perfectly round eyes.Sou!It suddenly scuttled towards the willow tree and wanted to nibble on its tender bud. It sensed the abundant divine essence and the incredible life force it contained.\u201cHairy Ball, don\u2019t!\u201d Shi Hao cried out in alarm.The lustering green willow branch dropped down and immediately constrained Hairy Ball in mid air. If someone didn\u2019t examine it too intently, they would have thought it was suspending there by itself. This unforeseen event caused both its eyes to widen with amazement as it tried its hardest to struggle free.The little guy hastily explained. \u201cWillow Deity, don\u2019t bother with it. Although it\u2019s an Archaic Descendant, the symbols in its body already shattered and it might have lost all its memories.\u201dThe Willow Deity only let go after a long while. Obviously, it was very mindful of this golden Zhu Yan, but it didn\u2019t say much about it.After Hairy Ball broke free, it shrieked and tumbled down onto Shi Hao\u2019s shoulder right away and hid behind his hair. Both of its big eyes stared at the willow tree and didn\u2019t dare to mess with it again.Everybody from Stone Village came over and piously prayed to the willow tree to express the reverence in their heart.Finally, the chief with an daring attitude, recounted the little guy\u2019s cultivation results and asked how he should proceed.No one thought that the willow tree would actually answer, but instead, its divine message was \u201cDuring the ancient era, the descendants of the strongest vicious beasts such as the Genuine Hou or the Golden Winged Peng could lift a hundred thousand jin of divine metal when they are young.\u201cAh!\u201dEveryone was shocked because this was too mind-blowing.What kind of existence was the Willow Deity? It would never speak any lies and was much more reliable than any legends they had heard before. It was only because this information was too astonishing.\u201cThat strength came purely from the power of their flesh, without any of their species\u2019 special supreme precious techniques.\u201d The Willow Deity added.Golden Winged Peng, Genuine Hou, these Archaic vicious beasts could step into the heavens without even thinking. Their precious techniques would be absolutely unrivalled and unparalleled.All the villagers were stupefied and speechless.\u201cTherefore, you don\u2019t need to be anxious in making a breakthrough. It would be most beneficial if you strive to break through the barrier of having a corporeal strength of one hundred thousand jin in the shortest amount of time possible,\u201d warned the willow tree.The villagers stared blankly. Clearly, the willow deity treated the little guy favorably and spoke more things than it had in the last ten years because of him.\u201cI will do my best!\u201d The little guy blinked his large eyes and clenched his little fists. Then afterwards, he timidly asked, \u201cWillow Deity, can you help me look into my subconscious? I want to know what happened in my past.\u201dHe was very nervous and was afraid about learning the cruel truth, but he truly wanted to know what exactly had happened during his past.\u201cI can,\u201d the willow tree succinctly responded with these two words.Pig = Zhu in chinese. Zhu Yan = different Zhu in Chinese.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As if everything fell into primal chaos, the entire world became quiet just like the days before the creation of the world.Everyone was fearful. There was only a single branch that emitted light in the past, but now that broken trunk also underwent an unexpected transformation and produced such an astonishing scene that they could not help but take a step back.Zhi Zhi\u2026.The fist-sized fur ball scurried away with a\u00a0chi\u00a0sound as screeching sounds endlessly came out of his mouth. It nearly tripped and fell into the lake as it stared from the distance with its perfectly big and round eyes.The villagers all kept their distance as well. The only person remained near the village entrance was the little guy. As he was slowly enveloped by that hazy mist, it became difficult to see everything clearly.Little Shi Hao remained motionless as if he was standing at the edge of the world. Chaotic air filled the atmosphere; he once saw this, but he was too young to remember any of it. The memories hidden within his sub-consciousness were now being recreated right in front of his eyes.Eternally respected, the first to arrive. Stolen powers, relationships spread far and wide.\u00a0Moving the five virtues, bearing the burden of life\u2026.A massive serene and solemn voice resounded between the sky and the earth. This scene seemed straight out of a legend.A huge, ancient and simple altar reached into the clouds. It released an aura that was able to change the world, and it appeared to have existed for millions and millions of years. There were many ancient images engraved on it, such as the sun, moon, stars, Archaic Descendants, first natives and even a deity. It was entirely awe-inspiring.The alter was grand and imposing, and its size was without boundary. It reached above the mountains, and was surrounded by clouds. The carcass of an Archaic descendant laid upon it, and its blood trickled onto the diagrams. In addition, there were strange divine treasures, and rarely seen precious medicine\u2026 This was the sacrifices an entire country made to the heavens!A golden sun emitted an utmost powerful aura. Its glare was so powerful that people couldn\u2019t open their eyes. A terrifying silhouette stood in the middle, illuminating the entire sky. The silhouette looked like a god of heaven who disdainfully looked down from the heavens above. Its golden blood essence naturally proliferated outwards as it created this appearance.This was the emperor of an ancient country that controlled millions and millions of li\u2019s worth of mountains and rivers. Today, he was personally making sacrifices to the heavens while being incomparably solemn.Behind him were the strongest experts of the imperial family that all had a terrifying amount of influence. When they opened and closed their eyes, it seemed as if rays of electricity appeared. Even further behind stood the lords and their endless court subjects.The people alone numbered in the tens of thousands, and many of them came from different lands. All of them were terrifying experts within their regions, and the aura they emitted trembled even the heavens and earth.Behind them was an endless army that never ended. It was impossible to know just how many people there were as they filled up the entire visible earth. Even while standing on the altar, it was impossible to see the end of them.Even a feudal prince commanded an innumerable amount of men, and none of these individuals were simple. With so many feudal officials and aristocrats assembled, even if each of them only a few of their men, the total was still an astonishing amount.The entire country offered sacrifices to the heavens. This was a seemingly unbelievable event straight from the legends!There were some wives and children of important characters on the side who also participated in this sacrificial ceremony while bathing in that vast ocean of divine splendor. One of the young women held a baby in the early stages of his infancy. The baby laughed happily as he kept his hands outstretched. His eyes were incredibly similar to Shi Hao\u2019s.Under the willow tree, the little guy stared blankly as if he was lost in thought.The scene of the sacrificial ceremony disappeared and another scene appeared.The huge lake was dark blue and clear, and it was also incomparably beautiful. The spiritual essence within it was dense and did not disperse, making it an extremely suitable place for cultivation. Many precious birds and beasts walked along the shore, and that place did not lack Archaic Descendants at all.No ordinary people dared to approach this kind of holy lake.In the distance, there were tens of thousands of fiercely mounted soldiers. On top of powerful vicious beasts sat soldiers clad in shining armor. Their divine spears pointed towards the sky, flashing in a cold metallic sheen that had a harsh aura about them. They stood there motionlessly, as they were standing guard; there were aristocrats hunting ahead.On the shore of the holy lake, terrifying descendants roamed about, and holy birds perched everywhere. Ordinary people could not enter this area; otherwise, they would lose their lives.But at this moment, several hundred people were appreciating the view and fearlessly shooting their arrows. Every one of them had an aura that overflowed the heavens, and they were so powerful that people trembled in their presence.A group of gorgeous bright-winged fierce birds who were perched by the holy lake were disturbed, and they immediately turned angry. Each of the vicious birds were six to seven meters long, and they were covered in feathers that shined like a burning divine flame.In particular, one of the bird kings that was 17 to 18 meters long had a five-colored divine light flowing about it. The beauty of its wings was astonishing as every type of divine light circled around it. Its power made the tens of thousands of mounted soldiers in the distance tremble with fear.It let out a long cry and produced a divine light that rushed into the heavens. It startled the endless number of mounted soldiers to retreat a step as its power shook the holy lake.\u201cHaha\u2026 such a good Luan. Unexpectedly, it\u2019s a powerful descendant that has the blood of Archaic Divine Birds flowing inside of it. Its truly a rare and treasured medicine. Look at how I\u2019m going to shoot it to death!\u201d An old man laughed.He drew a huge black bow that was strung with the muscles of a Flood Dragon. With his entire body emitting a bitter killing intent, he instantly arched his bow like a full moon and shot towards the sky.Chi!This one arrow shot out like a Flood Dragon, sending out sound waves of wind and thunder as it rose into the sky. At the same time, it emitted rays of flickering light and endless divine splendor that flowed into the heavens as it shot towards the Luan.With a\u00a0honglong\u00a0sound, a thread of lightning appeared in the sky. When the arrow collided with the Archaic Divine Bird descendant, endless multicolored red light exploded into an energy storm.An angry bird cry sounded as it was unexpectedly injured. It no longer dared to attack and escaped into the clouds after transforming into a streak of five-colored divine light.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d The old man arched his bow again and another divine arrow shot forth. The arrow had a terrifying trajectory, and it emitted light beams as it entered the sky. After disappearing within the clouds, a\u00a0pu sound echoed through, and a rain of blood splashed out as the Luan fell from the sky.\u201c15th elder, I didn\u2019t know you had such a divine mastery in archery. With two arrows, you shot down a powerful Luan. Others certainly have to experience this great battle. This method would certainly shake the capital city,\u201d praised an old elderThe elder who shot down the Archaic Descendant burst into laughter. Then with his own hands, he split apart the Divine Bird\u2019s descendant\u2019s body with a silver knife. He poured the most precious blood out and collected it into a bowl. Just this bowl alone contained the majority of the bird\u2019s essence.He then took large strides towards a young couple. The male was tall and majestic, and the woman was beautiful like flowers and the moon. She held a baby in the early stages of infancy.\u201cBe obedient my grandson, try out some of the divine bird\u2019s precious blood. Someday, you will certainly surpass your grandfather and your parents.\u201d The elder took out a jade chopstick and dipped a few beads of sparkling blood on it as he put it into the infant\u2019s mouth.\u201cDad, Hao\u2019er is still this small, can he handle it?\u201d The young couple tried to dissuade him.TL: Er is a term of endearment.\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt!\u201d The elder waved his hand and then fed a few big drops of the divine bird\u2019s blood to him in succession. That infant wasn\u2019t against it at all and instead used his strength to suck them in. His eyes shone brightly as he laughed. All the onlookers clicked their tongues in surprise.\u201cOur king\u2019s bloodline is at its peak with this generation. This will be an outstanding and prominent generation. This little guy will perhaps not be too different from the Yi child. In the future, perhaps he could suppress the entire land and be feared by all the large tribes out there,\u201d said an even older elder.After mentioning the two words \u201cYi child\u201d everyone gazed towards the child and all exposed an affectionate and concerned smile. He was truly unusual; he was born with two pupils in each eye, and this was the appearance of a saint from the distant past.This was a child who was around three years old. He was standing close by, and turned towards them. Although he was young, he was already well-built. He had four pupils that flowed with divine light, holding a sort of imposing presence that completely did not match his age.In the ancient era, those people that had those double pupils were known as saints or deities. Those people had world-shaking abilities and were unrivalled characters under the heavens.As soon as Shi Yi was born, his double pupils were discovered. Naturally, the news riled up a huge shock within the tribe. Everyone had extremely high expectations of him, and in fact, he was indeed very extraordinary. He was a heavenly genius that studied everything so fast that he vastly exceeded a normal person.\u201cAlthough we have a king\u2019s bloodline, we are the relatives of the emperor. The blood of the emperor flows within us. According to the rules, we could fight for the position of emperor,\u201d said an elder.Everyone once again shifted their gazes towards Shi Yi as they had very high expectations for him.\u201cYi ya\u2026.\u201d That infant cried lightly. His face was flushed red as he charmingly and naively smiled towards everyone.Everyone exposed a smile on their faces. An elder said, \u201cNaturally, our little Hao is very obedient and extraordinary. In the future, he can be his elder brother\u2019s right hand man when he becomes king.\u201cThe younger generation is quite numerous, there shouldn\u2019t be so many of them such that they have to be divided up into the bitter desolate land to become the rulers there instead right?\u201d Some people joked.They knew that there were some self-bestowed emperors within this great desolate land. They weren\u2019t conferred the title from an ancient country, and so the two emperors were at completely different levels.\u201cA place with a population of ten million dare to have a king. They abuse the people of the bitter desolate lands and exploit the people. No one cares about them, it\u2019s just something that the people who overestimate their abilities call themselves. Any truly powerful king who controls billions of people could easily exterminate a ten million population tribe by sending out a single family.\u201dThe stage changed again and the beautiful lake became fuzzy.A grand and imposing imperial city that looked like something that dropped down from heaven towered over the people. It occupied a vast region and had an uncountable population. The imposing city walls that shocked the citizens themselves seemed like an endless mountain range\u201cThe fifteenth elder in the hundred clan battlefield shot dead an archaic descendant \u2014 Pi Xiu. We don\u2019t know why this even shook the lands and caused such chaos!\u201dThe news spread and was hotly debated.\u201cAccurate information just came in, the one involved was just a cub, but it was much more powerful than a regular Archaic descendant. It is suspected that a matured Pi Xiu who possesses extremely pure blood is about to enter the hundred clan battlefield!\u201dThe Imperial City began to tremble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Spiritual essence filled the air and splendid lights shone faintly. Large groups gathered around a palace that was like a heavenly imperial watchtower established in the human world, and auspicious animals guarded the front entrance, roaring from a crouched position.\u201cDad killed a young Pi Xiu that had a very pure bloodline. This\u2026 he provoke a huge disaster!\u201d \u00a0A young man with a heroic appearance was terrified as he paced back and forth within the hall, completely restless.Dense fogs of light circulated within a king\u2019s mansion, and precious birds cried above the palace skies, sketching out streaks of dazzling radiance across the sky. The lake within the mansion was clean and clear, and water drained out in all four directions. A rocky mountain sat on the side, and beautiful flowers were everywhere within the incredibly huge and elegant garden. This was a heavenly paradise filled with dense divine essence.\u201cI hope father can leave the hundred clan battlefield as soon as possible.\u201d A beautiful woman was holding an infant. Her incredibly beautiful eyebrows were locked in a worrisome expression.\u201cNo matter what you say, it\u2019s too late. The news had already spread into the empire. Killing the Pi Xiu youth should have already happened several days ago. The things that should have happened should have most likely already happened by now.\u201d A young man grasped his hands tightly. His eyebrows stood straight as lightning shot out of his eyes. Rumbling noises began to sound indoors.The infant who was sound asleep opened his large clear eyes as he didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u201cDon\u2019t scare the child,\u201d said the beautiful woman.\u201cThese past few days have been torturous, and we even neglected little Hao. How can he keep sleeping like this and why do I feel the aura of symbols within his body?\u201d The young man turned around.\u201cYa, you sensed it too. I thought I felt something wrong. He\u2019s so young, how can symbols already appear within his body?\u201d The young woman doubted.\u201cCould it be\u2026.\u201d The heroic suddenly widened both his eyes and two bristles of lightning shot out towards the window. He scared a bunch of birds into rapidly fleeing.\u201cWhat did you just remember?\u201d The woman who was as beautiful as the flowers and the moon asked.\u201cThe truly most powerful experts within mankind are ultimately be born with holy bones, and would be born with their own primitive imprints, gaining their own exclusive precious technique!\u201d The young man\u2019s voice resounded and then emotionally said \u201cThere are several others who are naturally born with primitive precious bones such as the Golden Winged Peng and the True Hou. The precious technique they are born with could defy the world, such that even calling it a Supreme Being Bone wouldn\u2019t be excessive!\u201dHaving heard that, the woman was shocked and showed an expression of disbelief. She looked towards the infant in her bosoms and was so nervous that her hands were trembling.\u201cLet me have a careful examination!\u201d The young man was very decisive and walked over in large strides.The infant was very curious because he didn\u2019t know what they wanted to do. He blinked his large eyes and happily extended his little arms to show that he wanted the man to carry him.After examining the infant, the man was so shocked that even his fingers were trembling. The ordinarily calm and collected man\u2019s words were barely audible as he said, \u201cSupreme Being Bones\u2026.naturally born!\u201dWhat did this signify? In the future, this child could stand shoulder to shoulder with the heavenly ranked Archaic Vicious Beasts. He would be engraved into the history of mankind as someone who was able to fight with the pure-blooded unrivaled Golden Winged Peng, or the True Hou who had their own primitive precious techniques that could tremble heaven and earth.The woman held the infant and gently kissed his little red face. Her eyes glittered with radiance and said, \u201cWhether or not he truly has the Supreme Being Bone, he is still our child. He must grow up happily.\u201dSeveral days later, news came from the hundred clan battlefield. Like snapping apart rotten twigs, that adult Pi Xiu violently swept through the vast battlefield while blood-soaked. No one was able to be its opponent.Even though experts surrounded the fifteenth elder like clouds, they couldn\u2019t stop it either. They were chased for over a hundred thousand li until their arms were snapped off, and practically all the bones on their bodies were broken.Finally, he obtained the help of others. He arranged many pieces of the Archaic Descendant\u2019s precious bones to activate a divine spell, enabling him to escape in the end. His whereabouts, however, were unknown.His injuries were incredibly severe. Whether or not he would live was uncertain, but he did not return to the capital city.\u201cNot good, I have to go look for father!\u201d After the young man received the news, he stood up and decided to leave for the southern borders.\u201cThe tribe already sent out a large amounts of experts. The emperor even spread the news to feudal princes everywhere to aid the search. How much use would it be for you to go?\u201d The young woman was scared that his husband would place himself in danger to look for that Pi Xiu.\u201cWhether father is alive or not is still unknown. No matter what, I have to try my best to look for him!\u201d The man was very decisive and insisted on going.The beautiful woman understood her own husband\u2019s temperament. Whenever he had decided to do something, nothing else would change his mind. But as she was truly fearful that he would go look for that terrifying Pi Xiu, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. There are two precious techniques that will only reach its maximum output if we combine our powers.\u201d\u201cNo, you have to take care of little Hao!\u201d The man refused.\u201cI won\u2019t feel at ease with you like this.\u201d The woman shook her head. With a mild expression, she said \u201cThe tribe has so many people, could it be they can\u2019t take care of little Hao? Unless an Archaic Vicious Beast broke into empire\u2019s capital city, otherwise, who dares to break into our king\u2019s mansion and create chaos?\u201dThe man thought about it and felt that it made sense.He had already reported the news of Shi Hao being born with Supreme Being Bones to the two old Lord of Affairs. He thought that they would definitely treat this as a rare and precious baby so that nothing would happen to him.This matter was classified as top secret since this was an extremely important matter. Publicly, one Shi Yi was enough. Since he was born with double pupils, it was easy to see just by looking at his face, however, Shi Hao would not be so easily discovered unless a close relative examined him. Thus, this news would not leak out and would not concern other people and prevented a young death.\u201cEleventh brother and wife, are you really leaving for a while? You really don\u2019t have to. The experts of the tribe were already dispatched, they will certainly bring back fifteenth elder.\u201cRight, you don\u2019t need to worry. The heavens will help the worthy, fifteenth elder will certainly be okay!\u201dThe tribesmen persuaded, but the husband and wife insisted on leaving.\u201cEleventh brother, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll look after little Hao. Let him spend more time with little Yi and when they grow up, these two brothers will flatten the world and conquer ten thousand tribes!\u201d A young married woman laughed.Her appearance was outstanding, and she was precisely the mother of Shi Yi. The corner of her mouth bent as she laughed, and her sparkling pearl teeth shined. She was very warm and friendly, and had a heavenly gifted genius for a child. Her position within the tribe was extremely high.\u201cMany thanks sixth sister. It\u2019s fine if several tribal elders look after him. It\u2019s not good to worry you too much.\u201d The couple thanked.\u201cYounger sister-in-law, you\u2019re too courteous. We\u2019re all from the same family, don\u2019t say these type of things,\u201d said the young married woman.In the end, the couple began their travels and left the ancient country, heading for the hundred tribe battlefield.\u201cLittle Yi, in the future you have to become more familiar with little Hao. His gifts are extraordinary. When he grows up, he will be your right hand man.\u201d Go to the back of our palace crowd, the young married woman warned the double eyed child.\u201cEn!\u201d The three year-old child was unflustered. His actions far surpassed that of his age.The tribesmen all helped look after Shi Hao together along with many servants. Naturally, there weren\u2019t any problems. The first few days were rather noisy because he missed his parents, but he was very easy to take care of afterwards.After many days, the young married woman took Shi Hao to her own residence. Looking at her own child who stared at that infant with a glint of divine light within his eyes without blinking, she asked in confusing, \u201cLittle Yi, why are you always staring at your younger brother.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s very complicated. There\u2019s an unfathomably mysterious bone in his body that has a complicated symbol.\u201d Shi Yi calmly said.The young married woman was shocked. She knew her child was extraordinary and had the dual pupils that were of the same origin as ancient divine saints, and was able to clearly see the source of things.Suddenly, she was frightened and suddenly thought of something. She urgently asked, \u201cYou said that there\u2019s a bone in his body densely covered in primitive symbols?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied the young child calmly.\u201cNaturally born\u2026 Supreme Being Bone!\u201d The young married woman trembled on the spot. She thought back to that ancient legend and couldn\u2019t control her heart beat.After a long while, she had a shady expression as she stared at that naive and pure infant. Her eyes contained a flash of evil and then turned towards her child and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell this to anyone!\u201dThe child nodded and didn\u2019t say anything.Instantly, several months passed and little Shi Hao grew cuter as he aged. In the blink of an eye, he was eight to nine months old. He was able to walk by himself a long time ago, and was now even able to talk. His eyes were lively and his skin was pretty like porcelain. Anyone who saw him couldn\u2019t help but pinch his little face.During this time, the young married woman took care of little Shi Hao meticulously, as if he was her own. In the end, she simply brought him to her own residence and cared for him along with Shi Yi.\u201cAunt, I want to go to the garden to watch the Scarlet Feathered Cranes. Sister Mang said that they were very pretty. Their entire bodies are like scarlet fore, and their sounds are very pleasant to listen to.\u201d The little guy blinked his large eyes and spoke while his long eyelashes lightly shook. His voice was very infantile, and had a lovable and soft milky sound to it.Ordinarily, a child this young could not talk this freely and even walking was difficult, but for him, it was simple.\u201cSister Mang? That\u2019s a girl from a servant family. Don\u2019t listen to her nonsense, aunt will take you to see a Luan, and the Five Colored Peacock King,\u201d said the young married woman.\u201cSister Mang is a good older sister. She\u2019s very kind-hearted and pretty. She tells me stories quite often.\u201d Little Shi Hao blinked his large eyes and sincerely said.\u201cOkay, after dinner, we\u2019ll go see the Scarlet Feathered Crane, and then after that, I\u2019ll bring you to see the Luan and the Five Colored Peacock Ping.\u201d The young married woman smiled.\u201cAunt is the best!\u201d The little guy raised his head. His two hands clasped together and his eyes shined like stars, full of hope and desires.After that, he turned around and said, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s go to the backyard and play. There are many children there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going!\u201d Shi Yi declined and sat cross-legged on the ground. At a very young age, he was already steady like a boulder, silently cultivating the Bone Text.\u201cEh, then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d The little guy ran to the backyard on his toes to find a bunch of servant children to play with. There, he happily laughed and played.The little guy was pretty and adorable, and he was very kind-hearted. He never bullied the servant children, and often played with them. Therefore, everyone in the mansion liked him.After a few days, the young married woman took Shi Yi and the little guy to visit the king\u2019s mansion together. She took a chariot to another manor to look at the Luan, Five Colored Peacocks and other descendants of the Archaic Devil Bird.\u201cAunt, where is the Luan?\u201d The little guy curiously asked. At the same time, he was a bit puzzled. After arriving at the manor, they went directly into an underground palace.\u201cWe\u2019ll see them soon,\u201d the young married woman expressionlessly saidAfter arriving at a private room, the young married woman\u2019s fingers flashed with a string strange of symbols, and she pressed against the little guy\u2019s body. However, the precious bones within his body directly appeared and shined. Even after that he still didn\u2019t faint.\u201cWorthy of being a Supreme Being bone!\u201d The young married woman\u2019s eyes grew even fiercer. She knew that the precious bone just started to grow!She clapped her hands and a figure soundlessly and breathlessly approached like a ghost from not far away. He grabbed the little guy and pressed him down on the ice cold bed.\u201cAunt, what\u2019s happening?\u201d He bewilderedly asked. This was an eight to nine month old child. Other children were still confused and ignorant, but he was innocent and kind-hearted.A gorgeous silver knife flowing with a fascinating luster flashed past. It sliced open the little guy\u2019s chest and fresh blood suddenly spilled out. At the same time, a lump of hazy divine splendor circulating with heavenly mysteries containing uncountable symbols flashed there non-stop.\u201cIt hurts!\u201d The little guy painfully cried. His eyes were full of surprise. He never could have thought that he would be treated like this. He was still eight to nine months old, what could he have known?\u201cUnexpectedly, he didn\u2019t pass out, so troublesome.\u201d The young woman indifferently said.At the other side, there was another child \u2014 Shi Yi. He calmly looked on in silence. It was really questionable whether or not he was actually four years old.Fresh blood flowed and the little guy\u2019s face paled. His big eyes were expressionless and he continually cried out in pain as his blood continued to spill out.\u201cLet there be no accidents! I researched the ancient bone books and remembered that this method will be successful. My child was born with double pupils, he will certainly be honored in the heavens and earths!\u201d The young woman nervously shouted out.\u201cAunt\u2026.\u201d The little guy lifted up his little face filled with tears. He extended both his hands and wished that he could alleviate the pain.However, the young woman was indifferent. Her face was ice-cold. She only warned that ghostly figure to be careful and not let the Supreme Being Bone lose its life force.\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d In the end, that figure produced a muffled voice that sounded like a wild animal after cutting open a lump of light from the little guy\u2019s chest. There was a hard to describe mystical power around it, and as soon it started growing, it became soul-shaking. It emitted endless divine radiance as it illuminated the entire room.\u201cLittle Yi, it\u2019s your turn. You must hold on!\u201d The young woman nervously warned the child at her side.The child nodded without saying a word.He laid on a jade bed. With a streak of the silver knife, his chest split open and blood began to spill.\u201cBe careful, don\u2019t make any mistakes!\u201d The young woman\u2019s eyes were vicious and loved her child very dearly.On top of that ice-cold bed by the side, the little guy was withering in pain. His large eyes were full of tears. Every time his long eyelashes moved, sparkling tears rolled down. He extended his little hand with great difficulty, and he seemingly wanted to reach out to even a bit of warmth. He implored in a trembling voice \u201cAunt\u2026\u201dThe young woman coldly gave him a glance and then ignored him. She turned her head towards the other bed. With an affectionate expression and a gentle voice, she quietly asked \u201cLittle Yi, you must hold on. In the future, this entire land will be yours, because\u2026 you\u2019re the natural born Supreme Being.At the side, the little guy who lost his Supreme Being Bone laid on the ice-cold bed by himself. His snow white face was full of tears. He slowly lost consciousness and muttered \u201cMother\u2026\u201d At his most painful moments, he called out his true relatives in a sorrowful manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he began to lose consciousness, he weakly called out. Only his mother was the best and the most gentle. Only she wouldn\u2019t harm him.When his mother left, he was only several months old and only had a fuzzy impression of her. Now, however, her warmth was what he longed for the most, and he wanted to fall asleep within her bosom.Tears endlessly rolled down from his small pale face, and his entire body was curled up. He was shivering and trembling as he huddled towards the corner of the ice-cold bed.A muffled groan came from the jade bed on the other side. Although Shi Yi was young, he didn\u2019t have any fear. His double pupils concealed a divine light, and he bit into a piece of soft wood. His body was drenched in cold sweat as he persevered through the pain.\u201cGood child, you will certainly be able to bear it. After today, you will soar into the heavens and no one will be able to stop your rise to the top. You will be the most prominent heavenly genius in this entire land.\u201d The young woman nervously held the child\u2019s hand to help him feel some warmth and resist some of the pain.That lump of light had an uncountable number of densely-packed symbols, and those symbols circulated with complicated and heavenly mysteries. Anyone who saw this scene would immediately feel their hearts palpitating, and would immediately feel a need to worship it.The young woman\u2019s eyes were crazy, and she was becoming more and more certain that what she was doing was worth it. Even if she ended up being exposed, it was fine as long as the Supreme Being Bone was implanted within little Yi. This Supreme Being Bone had just begun its growth, yet it already had such power. If it were to grow in the future, it would certainly be outstanding.The Archaic Golden-Winged Peng and the True Hou were supreme beings that dared to massacre the gods, yet naturally born Supreme Beings were able to fight with them. In the future, who would dare oppose him?\u201cSoon it will be finished. Little Yi, hold on!\u201d She continuously encouraged. Her face was gentle as she helped Shi Yi relax, guiding him through this difficulty.Brilliant light radiated everywhere, and it seemed as if a Supreme Deity lied dormant there. It released divine rings, gorgeously illuminating the entire room. The divine radiance sprinkled everywhere, and made it appear like the world of gods.Shi Yi\u2019s chest was fully filled with the dazzling source of light. His struggles became even more intense. He yelled out like a wild beast in unimaginable pain as his entire body was drenched with sweat.\u201cYou be careful. Don\u2019t hurt my little Yi!\u201d The young woman\u2019s face appeared evil as she shouted at the shadow. She was even more nervous and afraid of failure now.\u201cAlthough the records are detailed, this is after all a Supreme Being Bone. The transplant procedures are extremely dangerous. Even a little mistake will cause it to explode and you and I might be buried here alive.\u201d The ghostly shadow said in a deep voice.\u201cI don\u2019t care. I just need this to succeed. Since the bone book has records of this, this must have been done before. There\u2019s no reason that we can\u2019t succeed.\u201d The young woman lightly shouted and her pretty face turned a bit ugly. She held Shi Yi\u2019s hands and said, \u201cWe all belong to the Stone family bloodline, so we came from a common origin. The success rate must be high. Little Yi stay strong!\u201dThe shadow lightly bellowed and afterwards, the entire room began to boil. Gorgeous divine radiance began to blossom into every inch of the room.Multicolored flames exploded, thunder descended, and lightning danced around, causing divine rumbling noises. All kinds of strange sights began to emerge.In the end, the light began to weaken and the symbols began to condense into a single Supreme Being Bone after it entered into Shi Yi\u2019s chest. The shadow quickly moved, and various symbols rushed forth to heal the wound and staunch the bleeding.\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201dAfter a deep voice, the room completely quieted down, and the strange sights began to disappear.\u201cGood child, you are mother\u2019s pride. From now on, no one will be able to stop you. This entire land will tremble under your feet!\u201d The young woman was incredibly emotional and held one of Shi Yi\u2019s arms. Her face was full of joy and her eyes burned with incredible radiance.She grabbed a soft blanket and very carefully covered Shi Yi who passed out. Finally, she stood up and couldn\u2019t help but let out a loud, crazy, and maniacal laughter.\u201cAunt\u2026 I\u2019m cold.\u201d Curled up on top of the ice cold bed, the little guy shivered. He was woken up by the laughter. His chest was in pain and his face was pale as he weakly called out.The young woman suddenly turned and did not get a blanket, but instead stared at him with a cold and merciless gaze. She told that shadow \u201cExtract the remaining true blood within his body to nourish the Supreme Being Bone inside of little Yi.\u201dWhere the Supreme Being Bone grew, there was the corresponding true blood to nourish that unique and powerful primitive precious bone that had an astonishing divine nature.\u201cIf we extract it out, this child most likely won\u2019t survive past two.\u201d The shadow said.\u201cTwo? A year and a half is enough. During this time, anything can happen.\u201d The young woman coldly said.The shadow heard and no longer said anything. It then took out a jade jar and symbols flickered as it utilized a secret technique to extract the blood. Immediately, a hazy light began to shine and illuminate the room.\u201cUse the technique as soon as possible. Use the jar to store the precious blood that will nourish little Yi\u2019s body to help him fuse with the Supreme Being Bone as quickly as possible.\u201d The young woman urged.\u201cIt\u2019s best to take it one step at a time and proceed slowly.\u201d The shadow warned.\u201cNo harm, little Yi was born with double pupils, so how can normal children compare to him. Furthermore, the sooner he fuses, the sooner I\u2019ll feel at ease. At the very least, even if someone discovers within half a year, they will have no way of transplanting the Supreme Being Bone. Doing that excessively will cause it to wither and die.\u201cSo cold\u2026\u201d The little guy passed out again and even his mouth turned white. His little body constantly shivered as he curled up in the corner of the bed.After everything was finished, the room became quiet again. That black shadow left and the empty underground palace seemed a bit eerie.The young woman paced back and forth by herself. Her brows were furrowed as she pondered about how to explain herself. It was likely that no one within the clan had discovered the secret Supreme Being Bone within his body unless they had a high cultivation and carried him daily. People who met these conditions should only have been his parents, and right now he was already eight or nine months old. He had long passed the need for someone to carry him.\u201cLittle Yi was naturally born with double pupils and can see through many origin of powers. No one else should have this kind of power, so no one else should be aware of this!\u201d The young woman\u2019s eyebrows relaxed after thinking about this matter.\u201cIf that couple die under the Pi Xiu\u2019s claws or perished out there for whatever reason, then everything will be perfect.\u201d She lightly spoke to herself and hung a cold expression at the corners of her mouth.Hong!Suddenly, a terrifying noise echoed through, and the underground palace collapsed. The exit was destroyed by a tremendous force. A majestic elder with a full set of white hair and beard rushed in. His entire body was covered in endless arrays of light like a burning divine flame.The young woman was alarmed. The underground palace entrance wasn\u2019t something that a normal person could forcefully break through. It was only something that could only be done by the clan\u2019s supreme experts.Divine multi-colored light gushed out into ten thousand directions. An old man broke into the secret room like an angry lion. After seeing the scene in front of his eyes, his eye sockets practically bursted out. He shouted out in a world-shaking voice \u201cSlut, you vile and poisonous woman!\u201dThis was one of the two lord of affairs within the clan. His seniority was well respected and his strength was extremely powerful. Usually he wouldn\u2019t appear in public and would cultivate his body and mind within an ancient cave to gain enlightenment.Shi Hao\u2019s parents entrusted their child to him and one other person. Only they knew about the Supreme Being Bone within his body as this was considered classified information.Originally, it was him and another elder who were supposed to look after Shi Hao to ensure he was protected. In the end, they were old as well as being males, so they didn\u2019t really know how to take care of a child. \u00a0After that, they agreed to let the younger generation look after him.The tribe was always peaceful. The wives of their grandson all tried their best these past few months to healthily raise little pretty Shi Hao to relieve them of their worries. Never did they think that such a disaster would have happened today.This elder was always careful and dispatched experts to follow the little guy. Today, this young woman spent too long taking two children to look at the Archaic Divine Bird\u2019s descendants. The experts who followed rushed back in confusion and reported that a few people entered the underground palace. After finding out they couldn\u2019t open the door, they rushed back shocked.\u201cYou vile women. I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d The old man\u2019s hair and beard were all shining and a golden lion. Instantly, he pounced forth. Like squeezing a little chick, he grabbed her neck and lifted her up with one hand.Although the young woman\u2019s position was very high and had exceptional strength, compared to this elder, she was absolutely nothing. Her face paled on this spot, and all the symbols on her body were going to explode.\u201cFourth grandfather, don\u2019t kill my mother!\u201d Shi Yi was woken up by the roar. He took that silver knife by the bedhead and pressed it against his own neck until a bloody scar appeared.\u201cYou\u2026 little bastard!\u201d The elder was angry.\u201cFourth brother, let her go first.\u201d Another elder walked in and his entire body bursted with scarlet light like an old phoenix. Although he was old, he had eyes like golden lamps and appeared spry and nimble.\u201cFifth elder, what do you mean. This is one of your younger generations, so you want to selfishly forgive her?\u201d The old man with the appearance of a golden lion shouted.\u201cFourth grandfather, please don\u2019t kill my mother!\u201d On the other side, the double pupiled Shi Yi spoke once again. The silver knife was soaked in blood against his cut neck.\u201cDo you see? We lost a Supreme Being! Could it be that you want to look on helplessly as another double pupiled child dies? In the ancient era, this is a saint, a god. Let her go first and argue later.\u201d The elder with the appearance of a phoenix said.Hong!The golden lion elder viciously tossed the young woman against the opposite wall. A huge sound was produced as the trembling caused many stones to fall. She couldn\u2019t stand up for a long time.\u201cZiling, I\u2019ve let you two down. I couldn\u2019t take of little Hao and let him suffer a gargantuan amount of grievance and torment.\u201d The elder snarled towards the sky.\u201cFourth grandpa\u2026 I\u2019m cold, it hurts.\u201d The little guy who curled up by the corner of the bed feebly opened his mouth.\u201cGood child, it\u2019s all my fault!\u201d The elder took him into his chest and his tears almost fell down. He activated the mysterious powers of the precious symbols and wrapped him in the multi-colored light that he emitted.\u201cWhere\u2019s the Supreme Being Bone?\u201d His body was scarlet red. His divine splendor surged as Blood Phoenix elder askedThe young woman\u2019s face was pale. She stood up without a word.\u201cGrandfather, it\u2019s inside my body.\u201d Shi Yi threw down the silver knife and calmly said.The Blood Phoenix elder heard this and an unusual light flashed in his eyes. He did not speak for a long time.The elder who held the little guy became even angrier having hearing that. He said in a trembling voice \u201cMy Stone Tribe has ancestral rules. We cannot cause internal strife and must unite against the foreign powers. Otherwise, how can we walk out of our ancestral land and conquer this vast territory? How could we control millions and millions of people with an emperor on the throne and countless number of kings? You woman, too vile, this tribe cannot tolerate you!\u201d\u201cThis affair has gotten complex and now involves a Supreme Being Bone. This is the highest level of classified information within the tribe that cannot be leaked out. This isn\u2019t a place for talking. Let\u2019s go back first then talk.\u201d The elder on the side said.\u201cFifth elder, you think we can\u2019t hide this anymore?!\u201d The Golden Lion elder shouted.\u201cNo matter what, we can\u2019t let the naturally born Supreme Being disappear. Let\u2019s return to the mansion then talk.\u201d The elder who emitted scarlet light said.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m not taking any actions now. When Ziling returns, he won\u2019t let this slide. With his temperament, if he doesn\u2019t destroy your family, he will wipe out a majority of it. If you treat him unfairly, he is not the type of person that will let it go!\u201d The Golden Lion elder spoke with bold and powerful words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Perfect WorldCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58 \u2013 Shi ZilingThe mansion was grand and magnificent, and majestic palace halls decorated the interior. Its grandeur was boundless, and it was just like a heavenly temple situated in the human world. It was dyed under the golden radiance of the sunset, solemn and serene. It gave people a spiritual mood, making them want to bow down and worship it.However, under this blessed atmosphere, a dark wave was billowing within this building. Great waves of darkness rushed forth, and killing intent permeated the huge palace hall. Within one of the palace halls, the atmosphere was extremely tense, and ten or so elders were sitting upright. Symbols flickered about, and they could erupt at any time.The little guy was on the verge of death. His Supreme Being\u00a0Bone was taken out, and this matter shook the higher officials. These elders who all had high positions were dragged out, as this matter could not be concealed from them.These tens of people were ordinarily in isolation, and did not partake in any worldly affairs to the point where some of these elders had not appeared in front of the tribe for over twenty years. However, they were all disturbed from their isolation, and were asked to come out from seclusion.\u201cA natural born Supreme Being was unexpected injured by the tribe. Did the sky turn upside down? Kill this woman by death of a thousand cuts right away!\u201d An elder was absolutely furious.\u201cHer grandfather and clansman aren\u2019t simple people; they are quite strong. If we kill without saying a word, it will be rather troublesome. The inner members of the capital were already discussing this matter. Words will spread like wind, if we explain about this matter, the news of the Supreme Being Bone will inevitably be exposed to the world.\u201d Another elder gently said.\u201cEven if the emperor did this, he would still have to explain it to everyone under the sky, let alone her family. You want to hide this matter, so you place emotion over reason and bend the law to help your own?\u201d cried out an elder on the side. His eyes contained the sun, moon and stars, and the aura he gave off even twisted the tables.The palace hall was covered in terrifying dense symbols. \u00a0Electricity interwove, and the smell of conflict was dense to the extreme.The little guy was at his last breath, and was carried within an individual\u2019s chest. He was currently protected by a divine light that was as vigorous as the ocean, nourishing his life force and preventing his weak essence from dying out.\u201cShe will naturally be dealt with, so we can talk about it later. Right now, the important matter is not losing the Supreme Being Bone. A Supreme Being that belongs to our Stone Tribe cannot simply disappear because of this.\u201d spoke an elder with a penetrating gaze. His scarlet body seemed like it was bathed in a heavenly flame, and he was calm and steady.\u201cFifth elder, what do you mean?\u201d The elder that looked like a golden lion shouted as he stood up, \u201cWe have to take it out and put it inside Shi Hao to let him continue growing it. This belongs to him, no one else should think about taking it!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s taken out, it\u2019ll be difficult for it to continue growing right away.\u201d\u201cJust because little Yi is part of your family, you have to protect him until the end. The Supreme Being Bone should belongs to whom it rightfully belongs to!\u201dDivine light flashed between these two people and the palace hall rumbled like mountains; the entire holy palace hall was shaking.\u201cFourth brother, it\u2019s not because I gave in to bribes.\u201d The elder who looked like a Blood Phoenix stood up and pointed towards the little guy and said, \u201cYou guys look. This child is so weak and feeble. Even though he is being fed precious medicine daily, it\u2019s still hard for him to recover. How can he nourish the Supreme Being Bone?\u201dWith these words, the quarreling sounds suddenly lessened. Many people stopped talking because this was the truth. \u00a0Whether or not the little guy could still live was hard to say.\u201cIn my opinion, I\u2019d rather not want the Supreme Being Bone than break tribe rules. Behead that mother and child!\u201d An elder with a fiery temper said.After saying this, everyone jumped a bit in fear. Not only would the tribe lose a Supreme Being, the double pupil child will have to perish as well?\u201cSecond brother, calm down. Little Yi is still an ignorant child. This matter is unrelated to him. He is like the ancient saints and possess a deity\u2019s potential. In the future, he will eventually disdain ten thousand tribes. Don\u2019t involve this with him.\u201d A few people reconciled.\u201cIgnorant child? How does he even resemble one! After he came back, he was desperate and put a knife to his throat and said if his mother dies, he would die with her. This kind of crime, how can we let that vile women go and make everything go her way?\u201d said the elder coldly. His entire body was covered in a brilliant splendor like a river of stars, and it circulated with frightening power.\u201cWe can push back the topic on how to handle that vile women until later. Right now, we need to first talk about the Supreme Being Bone.\u201dMany people were silent within the palace hall. No matter what, they couldn\u2019t bear to see both children being wasted. The strongest bloodlines must continue.\u201cThe Supreme Being Bone is already implanted within little Yi\u2019s body, how are the results?\u201d Right at this moment, the one with the highest seniority, an old man who hasn\u2019t left his private dwelling for thirty year suddenly opened his eyes like the emergence of two golden suns. Splendid rays of light burst forth causing rumbling sounds that terrified others to an extreme.Everyone suddenly calmed down and no longer quarreled.\u201cIt already fused together with little Yi and gained the nourishment of his flesh and blood. You already can\u2019t tell that it once belonged to another person; the results were astonishing. It was like it was born naturally within his body,\u201d said the fifth elder.Everyone\u2019s hearts trembled and felt emotional; it actually succeeded. Double pupil in addition to the Supreme Being Bone, how high will he reach in the future? That kind of accomplishment was simply inconceivable.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this in a few days, let\u2019s end this today for now,\u201d said another elder. His position was incredibly ancient, and he also had not shown his face for twenty to thirty years.Everyone nodded. The fourth elder who seemed like a golden lion and that elder with the fiery temperament were speechless. They knew that the tribe would not allow the Supreme Being Bone and the dual pupils\u00a0perish.Several days later, news came through. The Supreme Being Bone was unaffected within Shi Yi\u2019s body. It was bound by a powerful life force and was practically fused into his body.\u201cSpiteful!\u201d The fourth elder lightly bellowed. He knew that he lacked the power to reverse this desperate situation, and what this signified was obvious. He held the feeble little guy with an unpleasant emotion.The little guy\u2019s aura was weak. His eyes were dim without expression. Although he was nourished by the spiritual essence of the tribe\u2019s experts, it was still difficult for him to make a recovery. Everyone sighed within their hearts.The clansman found many spiritual medicines, but they were all useless. It was hard for him to recover. His little face was pale and he was continuously coughing, and would often shiver with coldness all over.After half a month, his state worsened. His large eyes did not contain a trace of brilliance and looked even sicklier, as if he could die at any time.Moreover, at midnight, the little guy\u2019s bones would creak and his entire body would decrease in size. His entire body lost its spiritual essence, and it severely degenerated.He was clearly eight to nine months old, but because of his critical injuries, he seemed like he became several months younger. His body worsened by the day.\u201cAre you\u2026 my fourth grandpa?\u201d The little guy laid on his bed and opened his emotionless and expressionless eyes as he feebly asked.He continued to degenerate. It was as if there was a bottomless pit within his body eating away at his blood essence and bones. He seemed like he was only a few months old and did not seem as intelligence as he was before, practically unable to recognize the people beside him.The elder was heartbroken and unceasingly lightly patted him and coaxed him to sleep.\u201cWhy am I almost forgetting the people beside me? It\u2019s becoming more and more fuzzy\u2026\u201d The little guy tried his best to recollect his memory, but his eyes became increasingly bewildered.He was clearly an intelligent and lively child, but now he became like this. It made the servants sad, and it was difficult for them to watch this.After several days, even talking became a strenuous task. His eyes lost all traces of light. He looked at the little girl who stood beside his bed and asked in confusion, \u201cSister, who are you?\u201dThe pretty little girl wiped away her tears and light replied, \u201cI\u2019m sister Mang, young master, how could you not remember me?\u201d\u201cSister Mang, so familiar. How can I not remember?\u201d The Little Guy tried his best to think back. He stared at the ceiling with his large expressionless eyes that had lost the liveliness it had in the past.The little girl wept. Fearing others would hear, she covered her mouth. Tears stringed out of her large eyes as she finally lightly said, \u201cI heard fourth elder\u2019s words. You are a Supreme Being. No one could compared to you, but you were harmed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a Supreme Being\u2026\u201d The little guy muttered.\u201cRight, you\u2019re a Supreme Being. A natural born Supreme Being. Little Guy, you will certainly get better!\u201d The little girl wept.\u201cI will, I\u2019m a Supreme Being. I\u2019ll get better.\u201d The little guy lightly spoke.\u201cYa, I remember. You\u2019re sister Mang. You told me many stories and told me that you\u2019ll take me to look at Scarlet Feathered Cranes. You are so nice to me.\u201d The little guy suddenly remembered who this little girl was.\u201cEn!\u00a0Young master, you have to remember. You\u2019re a Supreme Being, and don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m sister Mang. Everything will get better.\u201d The little girl wept continuously.\u201cEn!\u201d The little guy made great effort and nodded, and it seemed as if he remembered something else, he said \u201cI seem to have some memories now. How come several other brothers and sisters did not come?\u201d\u201cThe other servant\u2019s children did not come. Young master Shi Bing\u2026 they went to cultivate.\u201d The little girl smiled with great difficulty.These few days, the other children within the tribe came less and less to the point that they disappeared. Even the other uncles and aunts of the tribe were practically unseen either and no longer came to look after him.The little guy grew weaker by the day, and he was no longer the intelligent and dazzling child who was destined to become a supreme expert.No one within the tribe said much. They weren\u2019t that superficial. They came less and less and became more detached than ever, however, a child that young couldn\u2019t understand these facts.Eventually, the little guy became weaker and weaker and degenerated into a critical state. Even sister Mang and the fourth elder could no longer recognize him.\u201cYoung master, you have to remember. You are a Supreme Being. Don\u2019t forget me either, I\u2019m sister Mang.\u201d The pretty young girl stood by the bed weeping with her large swollen red eyes.But the little guy could no longer speak and didn\u2019t know how to open his mouth to do so.After month later, Shi Ziling returned. He did not find the thirteenth elder, and after entering his mansion he immediately felt something was wrong since the mood was strange.\u201cWhere\u2019s little Hao?!\u201d He shouted.When the couple saw the little guy they were shocked to the point that they shivered. Was this a child that was around ten months old, how come he\u2019s this weak and small? His eyes did not have any shine to it. Where did the intelligence and spirited light he once had go?When the feeble little guy saw the couple, he subconsciously extended his hands and simple mindedly laughed like he felt an affection and warmth coming from they. He wanted them to carry him.\u201cLittle Hao!\u201d Shi Ziling yelled. His eyes almost bled. His father disappeared and his child was sabotaged. He was about to go mad.\u201cMy child, what happened to you?\u201d The little guy\u2019s mother was practically about to faint. She held him tightly within her bosoms right away.\u201cZiling, I\u2019ve let you couple down. I didn\u2019t take care of little Hao well. I shouldn\u2019t have let others raise him. You guys should punish this old man!\u201d The elder that seemed like a golden lion painfully said.\u201cWhat exactly happened?!\u201dWhen Shi Ziling learned the truth, he went mad. All the black hair on his hair stood upright. WIth a golden spear within his hand and symbols surrounding his entire body, his fighting spirit boiled. With a rumbling sound, a spear directly uprooted a portion\u00a0of the palace as he fought his way towards the direction where Shi Yi\u2019s bloodline lived.\u201cEleventh elder calm down. If you have something to say, say it nicely. We\u2019ll give you a good explanation!\u201d When a group of people heard the commotion, they rapidly rushed over.The so called ranked eleventh wasn\u2019t because he was the eleventh relative, but it was because he was the eleventh most powerful within the tribe. For the sake of appearing close, the tribe amalgamated and established this ranking.\u201cGo away!\u201d Shi Ziling\u2019s eyes stood upright. With the divine golden spear in his hand and symbols overflowing into the heavens like the ocean surging violently, his rage struck the heavens.With a\u00a0honglong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the group of people all rapidly fled. Every one of them was spitting out blood as none of them could block. All the mysterious patterns protecting their bodies exploded.Like a golden god of war, Shi Ziling doused in a golden divine flame that overflowed into the heavens as he advanced in large stride with a golden spear in his hands. Divine radiance shot forth from within his eyes, and with his incredibly cold voice, he said \u201cWhoever dares to block my way, I\u2019ll kill them no matter who it is or where they came from!\u201d\u201cEleventh elder, don\u2019t act so impulsively!\u201d A young man said while blocking the way.\u201cImpulsively? Hahaha\u2026\u201d Shi Ziling laughed madly. With ice cold eyes and yelled \u201cYou are little Yi\u2019s own uncle right? The one responsible for bullying the people of our family? Get lost!\u201dThe golden spear within his hands stabbed forth. An incredibly heavy divine light filled with uncountable symbols constructed battle spears made of light one after another. They emitted a foggy light that overflowed into the heavens as they flew forward.Pu!The youth across from him also began to act, but he was simply unable to defend. His weapon snapped and his precious artifact broke, then he was pierced by a divine golden spear and flew into the distance.\u00a0Boom, he was pierced onto one of the doors within the palace upstairs. He coughed out large mouthfuls of blood. Shock filled his eyes as their difference in power was too great.\u201cZiling, don\u2019t create such a mess. You can handle that vile woman, but little Yi is still a child, you can\u2019t kill him.\u201d A group of elders appeared.\u201cAll of you, go away. When my son was suffering, where were all of you? She broke one of my son\u2019s bones, I\u2019ll break a hundred of her son\u2019s bones!\u201d Shi Ziling shouted with rage with tears flowing within his eyes.When he returned to the tribe, seeing his adorable and intelligent child that he was before put into such a state, it made his heart twitch and bleed.Hong!Shi Ziling swept with the golden battle spear within his hands. His heavenly shocking precious technique activated. Like all the gods in heaven chanting together, ear-splitting cries began to erupt.The few elders who blocked his way all flew away from the shock. They spat blood violently from within their mouths with incomparable horror.When Ziling thought of his own child, it felt as if a knife was twisted within his heart. The little guy was too pitiful. He was originally a Supreme Being, but his Supreme Being Bone was taken away. As\u00a0his tears flew, he released his murderous aura.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An elder took out a string of bone beads the size of goose eggs, and each of the beads sparkled with a precious light. They looked like stars flying in the sky, and power fluctuated terrifyingly.They constructed a diagram of the stars and expanded outwards like a net, as if a river of stars were flowing. It contained a boundless aura and immediately enshrouded Shi Ziling below.\u201cLet me through!\u201dShi Ziling shouted loudly, and his full head of black hair went crazy. With a wave of his spear, golden light overflowed the skies and trembled the heavens. Even the corners of his eyes were split apart as he cried tears of blood. For his child to suffer such a disastrous tragedy, it made his heart drip blood. Right now, he would kill whoever stood in his way!The precious technique shocked the heavens. With a rumbling sound, he hollered out the incantations, and as if he was renouncing all deities through this chant, endless divine radiance scattered about, enshrouding this area. That diagram of stars was immediately broke apart.\u201cBreak!\u201dShi Ziling shouted loudly. He raised the spear in his hand, and the primitive symbols began to take shape as he rushed forward. Golden rays of light submerged everything in front of him.With\u00a0kacha\u00a0sounds, the strings connecting the snow white bone beads were broke one after another. The powerful strength of the symbols dissipated into a vast body of divine light as it began to disperse in all four directions.Many palaces abruptly flew into the air as if they were dead leaves. Under this berserk attack, they were all insignificant. Immediately after, they shattered in the air, turning into dust.This string of bone beads was a rare and powerful precious artifact, yet it was broken so easily by the battle spear and dissipated into heaven and earth divine essence. It made all the tribe elders\u2019 hearts sore.Stone Clan\u2019s members were all relatives of the emperor, however, even though they were bestowed the status of kings and were quite formidable, they still couldn\u2019t casually waste rare precious artifacts. The corners of this elder\u2019s mouth was bleeding, and his body was violently trembling. Many of his bones were broken, and he flew across the air before smashing into another palace. It was smashed apart, causing smoke and dust to rise.\u201cZiling stop. We\u2019re all family. Don\u2019t make such a big fuss and hurt family!\u201dA group of elders walked out from within the dust. They were covered in dust and had bloodstains all over. There was a look of anger and astonishment on their faces. This nephew was too powerful, and he was chasing right in his father\u2019s footsteps.\u201cInjuring family? The Supreme Being Bone within my son\u2019s body was taken away. His life\u2019s in danger, but that vile woman\u2019s family is still living well. Doesn\u2019t that already break our relationships?!\u201d Shi Ziling was seething with anger. The golden light over his body was flourishing even more now, brightly illuminating the sky and the earth like a burning divine flame. His voice was cold and reprimanded loudly, \u201cAlthough we have the same grandparents, none of you are my opponents. Apart from that vile woman\u2019s bloodline, all of you get out; otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless and massacring you all!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Angry looks appeared on some of the people\u2019s faces.\u201cZiling, if you have something to say, say it properly. What is there that we can\u2019t sit down and talk about?\u201d An elder advised.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about? You already made the decision to protect that vile woman and leaving the casualty of this to lick his wounds all by himself? Whether my son can even survive right now is tough to say, and you guys are telling me to sit? Very well, chop that vile woman and Shi Yi apart for me!\u201d\u201cImpudence, this is the decision made by over ten elders and you want to oppose it?\u201d An elder shouted loudly with a feathered fan that was wrapped in thunder and wind in his hand. He waved the fan with all his strength, and divine thunder descended onto earth, creating endless purple rays on the spot.\u201cYou\u2019re Shi Yi\u2019s granduncle?\u201d Shi Ziling\u2019s footsteps basically never stopped. He was charging forward from start to finish. A long whistle sounded, and endless burning rays of electricity shot forth from his eyes like golden lightning.Kacha!Suddenly, deafening rolls of thunder packed the heaven and earth with bristles of electricity, creating a huge violent explosion.The fan within that elder\u2019s hands bursted open. When the lightning withdrew, that entire person was burnt black and his head was smoking. Whether he was dead or alive was unknown. Afterwards, he was once again sent flying by a beam of golden light that was released from Shi Ziling\u2019s eyes. He collided into a palace, and never stood up again.Everyone breathed in a breath of cold air. Shi Ziling was too powerful, and he was worthy of being called the genius of the generation. With these methods and the heroic appearance of a god of war, he eclipsed those of the older generation as they were simply incapable of being his match.\u201cFifteenth elder truly gave birth to a good child.\u201d A few people muttered.The fifteenth elder\u2019s prowess were rather renowned within the empire. With only two arrows, he shot down an Archaic Descendant \u2014 a Luan. Who else could accomplish this? His cultivation was world-shaking.It was truly because of this that he dared to kill an extremely pure-blooded Pi Xiu youth in the hundred clan battlefield. Many elders of the older generation all guessed the fifteenth elder\u2019s intentions. He wanted to baptize his grandson\u2019s body with the true blood of a genuine Pi Xiu.Right now, his son was just as emphatic and decisive. His power shocked the capital city, and none of the elders of the older generation were his opponent. Like a golden god of war, he trembled the hearts of others.If could be\u00a0said that\u00a0if not for the fact that another family gave birth to Shi Yi, who was naturally born with divine gifts and the dual pupils possessed by ancient saints, Shi Ziling would inevitably be the one bearing the flag of the tribe in the future.In actuality, even if there was a Shi Yi, Shi Ziling\u2019s family would inevitably rise in power. No one could cover up the radiance because his son was born with a Supreme Being Bone.Unfortunately, things ended up like this in the end, and it made people want to wring their own wrists while deeply sighing.Honglong!Shi Ziling walked forward in large strides. With each step, huge cracks would be left in the ground below. It was as if a giant golden giant was moving, and nothing could stop him.\u201cBind!\u201dAn elder shouted loudly. He held a vine in his hand, and that vine was a precious artifact created from a powerful botanical creature. It was entirely black, but currently, it was shining with luscious light.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the floor of this palace was penetrated by one spirit vine after another, each of them emitting precious light. Like flood dragons, they crazily charged towards Shi Ziling to bind him.\u201cSuch despicable creatures. The people of your bloodlines, blocking me means death!\u201d Shi Ziling shouted loudly.He travelled like a dragon and took steps like a tiger; his might overflowed the heavens. All the hair on his head instantly rose up violently, and every strand of hair was sparkling. Afterwards, they emitted golden rays of light like a sun god, making his entire person seem incomparably resplendent.Hong!This thick golden hair poured down like a waterfall, charging towards the spirit vines. as if they were breaking and pulling dried up and rotten weeds, he twisted all the spirit vines into pieces and then struck towards the precious artifact in that old expert\u2019s hands.With a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound,\u00a0that precious vine exploded on the spot and burned into ashes. This powerful technique shocked and stunned the onlookers, sending chills and shivers down their spines.\u201cF*ck off!\u201dShi Ziling shouted. He brandished the long spear in his hand, and with a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, \u00a0fresh flood splashed outwards, directly tossing up that elder right into a man-made mountain. It broke apart, and the elder spat out blood from his mouth.\u201cZiling, you\u2019re turning into a demon. Stop immediately!\u201d A group of elders shouted loudly.\u201cIf doing this for the sake of my child makes me a demon, then today I might as well degenerate into a devil!\u201d Shi Ziling roared. His hair madly danced as he was bathed within a burning golden light. With large steps, he rushed forward and no one was able to fight him.He brandished his golden spear, and fresh blood spilt ten inches into the air from time to time. No one dared to stop him, since they would just be killed. This made everyone involuntarily fall back and turn pale.\u201cLay out the symbols to lock this area and suppress him!\u201dAt this moment, he had already entered the place where Shi Yi\u2019s family lived. Everyone in that family became nervous as they arranged the precious bones into a killing formation to suppress Shi Ziling.\u201cI\u2019ll see who can stop me!\u201d Shi Ziling was like an unrivalled demon king. Right now the killing aura around his body reached the heavens. The light within his eyes shocked a group of elders into trembling and retreating. \u00a0He looked towards them, and unexpectedly, no one looked back at him. Shi Ziling grasped his battle spear and with one step, he advanced ten feet. He fought as he advanced, and the palace his target\u2019s family lived was collapsing.\u201cSubdue and kill!\u201dThe precious bones shined, and one patch of symbols after another interweaved on the ground, densely covering the air. They formed an inescapable net and suppressing Shi Ziling within.Hou\u2026.Shi Ziling was crazy. He madly rushed into the air. Like a burning divine flame, his entire body exploded with unmeasurable amounts of light as if he was forged in gold. With his indomitable spirit, he waved the battle spear within his hands with all his might.Immediately, the chants of heavenly deities were heard once again. Endless amount of power surged forth violently. With a precious technique that shook the heavens, he was like a divine golden deity as he swept across in every direction.Hong!A gigantic and violent explosion occurred where he stood, and rubble flew into the clouds. Divine light was released outwards like a boundless ocean. Shi Ziling\u2019s battle intent rose into the heavens. His battle spear danced and the entire area collapsed, and all the precious bones exploded.\u201cAll of you, die for me!\u201dHe brandished the golden battle spear within his hands. All those who were a part of the formation flew outwards like scarecrows before toppling over. Their blood splattered everywhere. No one was able to stop him as he pressed forward with large steps.Shi Ziling\u2019s wife carried their child. Sparkling radiance circulated her entire body as she followed closely behind the entire way.The little guy was very bewildered. Looking at the figure that seemed like a heavenly deity in front of him, he kept extending his little hands and stretched towards it as he felt an intimacy towards it. He tried to shout\u00a0yiya from his mouth, but he was unable to speak a single word.His mother\u2019s nose was aching, and teardrops gathered within her beautiful eyes. The once spirited and intelligent child she once had now degenerated into this state. It made her feel so sad that her heart was bleeding.\u201cStop him!\u201d Many people shouted out in horror.Shi Ziling became a demon, and he became completely insane. It made them fear that he was going to completely exterminate all of them.\u201cKill him for me, kill him!\u201dAs a king, he naturally had many servants and even more scapegoats. This family feared that Shi Ziling would come and settle his debts with them, and naturally made many preparations. A group of densely packed people rushed forth. They were all experts that had no fear of death, and like ants with the will to bite an elephant to death, they wanted to completely tire out Shi Ziling while he was alive before killing him.\u201cCowards!\u201dShi Ziling did not show any fear. He stuck his battle spear onto the floor and activated his most powerful precious technique. At that moment, he was like a deity they offered sacrifices to. His aura was as powerful as a saint.A heavenly shocking sound was produced. Endless divine light bursted forth as if he stood in the center of the world. The sun, moon and stars revolved around him, and a huge vicious beast appeared, sweeping in all four directions.Aohou\u2026A deafening beast cry sounded out. This was a world-shocking precious technique. \u00a0This fuzzy Archaic vicious beast frantically wreaked havoc, and nothing could hinder its rampage. With a single drop of its claws, over ten people fell victim to the bloodbath.This area became a scene of slaughter. That huge body was powerful and unrivaled. As it soared, over a hundred experts were quickly killed, and everyone was terrified.This terrifying technique made people\u2019s hair stand up. With just one person, he was shockingly confronting an entire family of experts.Hong!Ultimately, Shi Ziling himself also began to move. His entire body began to emit an unfathomable amount of golden light. He swept forward, and the remaining people all flew away as their blood splashed out.In this short moment, the space in front of him was emptied. There was no one left to stop him, as they had all been disposed of.\u201cZiling, have you killed enough and released some steam?\u201d A group of people appeared in front of him. The one speaking was indeed the Fifth Elder. Scarlet clouds surged from his body like a noble Blood Phoenix from Nirvana, and his golden eyes were like two golden lamps.At his side was an extraordinarily gifted child with natural born double pupils. Although he was young, his presence and calmness put even adults to shame.After Shi Yi obtained the Supreme Being Bone, he became even more extraordinary. When he blinked, divine light circulated around his eyes. With every movement, he unexpectedly exerted a frightening and imposing aura.He was still young, yet he already possessed such an exceptionally terrifying aura, as if he was destined to rule over every living being. He was like a deity who had just descended down into the world, looking down on everyone.\u201cNot enough!\u201d Shi Ziling responded coldly. He looked back towards the little guy who had expressionless eyes. He was full of worry since the little guy was on his last breaths. With his battle spear in hand, he pointed forward and said \u201cUnless you restore my son, a debt in blood must be repaid with blood. You people committed such malicious actions, even heaven cannot tolerate this. Since you broke my son\u2019s Supreme Being Bone, pay it back with a hundred of yours!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How can this matter be compensated? Do not hesitate to ask, however, you can\u2019t destroy my clan\u2019s right hand,\u201d the elder calmly said.\u201cFifth elder, what are you saying?!\u201d Shi Ziling\u2019s eyes widened with his golden battle spear vertical on the floor. He stared towards the group of experts across from him and said, \u201cSeizing my son\u2019s Supreme Being Bone and causing him to degenerate nearly to death, moreover allowing that disastrous piece of shit become the clan\u2019s right hand man, how ironic that these words are coming out of your mouth!\u201d\u2018Fifth elder\u2019 meant that he was ranked fifth in his generation. His name was Ming Yuan and was a generation older than Shi Ziling\u2019s father. He was a clan elder within the tribe and had a powerful and unfathomably deep cultivation.\u201cZiling, whether this complicated matter is right or wrong should be discussed. You don\u2019t need to be angry. Let\u2019s sit down and talk it over slowly. We would certainly compensate you to your satisfaction.\u201d Shi Yuan blinked his eyes; divine light circulated around him and his aura was terrifying.\u201cSave it!\u201d How could Shi Ziling not be aware that the tribe had already made a decision a long time ago? How can it be taken back? He coldly said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about other things, hand over little Hao\u2019s Supreme Being Bone.\u201dThe expressions of the group of people across him all changed. They were all experts from Shi Yuan\u2019s family and they numbered over ten people. This request was impossible to fulfil; they couldn\u2019t hand over the Supreme Being Bone no matter what.\u201cZiling, if the Supreme Being Bone is taken out again, it will be hard for it to continue working. Use something else as compensation.\u201d Shi Ziling gently told him.\u201cWhether or not it will continue working, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. What belong to little Hao cannot be owned by anyone else!\u201d Shi Ziling shouted. There was a melancholic feeling within his heart. The precious bone that originally belonged to his child was taken just like that by someone else.\u201cNo!\u201d Shi Yuan shook his head resolutely and said, \u201cFor our tribe\u2019s prosperity, this type of thing cannot happen. The natural born Supreme Being cannot disappear.\u201d\u201cYou refuse?\u201d Shi Ziling\u2019s imposing manner was like a rainbow. His eyes accumulated thunder and lightning. With his battle spear in hand, he began to take large steps. he looked forward and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll take it myself!\u201dHe stared at Shi Yi and pointed the golden battle spear at his chest from afar. Multicolored light began to surge, and symbols rumbled like thunder as he began to take action.At Shi Yuan\u2019s sides, many experts held their weapons. A furious look gathered in their eyes as they prepared to take action. They were not going to allow a natural born dual pupiled saint to die young; they wanted to fight right then and there.\u201cGood, good, good!\u201d Shi Ziling said the word \u2018good\u2019 three times consecutively. His rage began to surge violently, and the golden light within his pupils flourished even more.\u201cZiling, any other request is fine. You just can\u2019t hurt little Yi.\u201d Shi Yuan walked out with a calm and steady gait. Scarlet light surged around his body and his shocking might fluctuated up and down like an ocean. He was an absolutely top-level expert. Let alone within the tribe, his name was even reputed within the entire empire.Shi Ziling raised his spear. What else was there to be said? The only choice now was to fight. Around his golden battle spear, divine symbol appeared one after another, and they looked like they were forged from metal. There was a cold feeling about them as they surrounded his battle spear, and they were emitting incomparable divine might.\u201cKill!\u201dShi Ziling charged forward. With a shake of his battle spear, the entire sky began to shake. Those symbols, seemingly lifelike, emitted divine splendor and pressured downwards.With a\u00a0honglong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the ten or so experts across from him involuntarily backed off. Like the weight of ten thousand mountains crushing down, it made all of their hearts quiver, and their bodies knelt down.This was the difference between them. Shi Ziling was a genius even recognized by the emperor, and his name was known everywhere. His strength was something that far surpassed what they could handle, and only clan leaders stood a chance against him.Only Shi Yuan remained on the battlefield. All the others staggered away without the strength stand on their feet, otherwise, their flesh and bones would have been crushed under the pressure of his aura.Rumbling sounds echoed as Shi Yuan\u2019s arms shook. Like a Blood Phoenix taking off into the skies, the scarlet light around him flowed into the heavens. His imposing aura suddenly increased by tenfold in power, blocking the incoming might of the golden battle spear.Hong!The battle spear was like a rainbow as its might pressed forward. It gathered up all the golden symbols within the air, trembling the heavens and the earth.Symbols densely covered Shi Yuan\u2019s right hand and transformed it into a divine wing as he struck forward. Splendid and dazzling scarlet phoenix feathers curled around him as the world-shocking cries of a phoenix were released.The divine phoenix wing collided with the golden battle spear. Like two active volcanoes, magma flowed into the sky and flames covered the air. This entire area was glaring, and nothing else could be seen.Both sides violently clashed. In the blink of an eye, they had over ten exchanges. One person was wrapped in golden light like a god of war, and the other was bathed in scarlet clouds like an Archaic Devil Bird, the Blood Phoenix. Both their speeds were extremely fast, and they unceasingly collided with each other, each time releasing an intense light that reached the skies.The spectators were all shocked. Shi Ziling was too powerful; he was able to force such a powerful clan elder to fight for his life. None of them could believe it as the difference in the amount of time they had spent cultivating differed by an extremely large margin!An shrill phoenix cry sounded, cracking open all the metal and rock in that area. Palace halls collapsed one after another, and it startled all the experts. They immediately used their symbols to protect their bodies, otherwise, they would have inevitably received injuries.Shi Yuan\u2019s hair and beard extended. Lightning accumulated within his eyes, and his entire body shined. An Archaic Devil Bird rushed forth from within his body, and it was scarlet red all over with pretty and colorful tail feathers. It expanded its wings, took to the sky, and aimed to kill Shi Ziling.He utilized his most powerful precious technique. Killing intent surged, frightening the onlookers into a state of incomparable shock. The clan elder was forced into using this method.Hou\u2026A dull roar sounded from where Shi Ziling stood. His entire body blossomed with golden light, and a huge vicious beast emerged as it squeezed between the heavens and the earth. Its head was held high as it roared, and it was as if a sovereign king who was served by over ten thousand creatures appeared as it overlooked the boundless earth.The figure of this beast was fuzzy, but no matter who it was, they knew this was one of the most powerful vicious beasts. Otherwise, there was no way it could possess such a tyrannical presence.With a rumble, the huge vicious beast\u2019s claws descended, covering the palace halls below. Its vicious aura shook everything within ten squared meters, and everyone couldn\u2019t help but tremble and kneel down.The Archaic Devil Bird released a long cry. It swept with its colorful wings toward that beast\u2019s claws and the two clashed violently.This was a battle of precious techniques; a battle of life and death between two experts who stood at the very peak. Boundless divine light swept in all four directions, terrifying everyone.\u201cGrandfather, hit his left rib!\u201d At this moment, Shi Yi suddenly opened his mouth. His eyes held two pupils flowing with divine splendor. At a very young age, he already possessed a terrifying presence. His eyes were able to see through many things in this world, and he saw an opening in Shi Ziling, directly yelling out to remind his own grandfather to attack that weakness.Hong!Electricity shot out from Shi Yuan\u2019s eyes. He directed his precious technique, and that Archaic Devil Bird immediately dove downwards towards the left rib of Shi Ziling to target his weakness.Hou\u2026.Unfortunately, that huge Archaic vicious beast released a cry that shook the mountains and rivers while instantly blocking that terrifying Phoenix like vicious bird. The heavens and earths trembled with a strike of its claws.\u201cGrandfather, attack the left armpit of that vicious beast!\u201d said Shi Yi once again. His eyes were incredibly profound and emitted strands of divine radiance. Incomparably frightening divine powers circulated.With a\u00a0honglong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the Archaic vicious bird attacked once again. Both its wings were spread out and its beak was wide open. It sprayed out endless amounts multicolored light, and a single one of those strands of light was able devastated a group of experts.Peng!The vicious beast lifted its huge claws and directly slapped the Archaic vicious bird\u2019s beaks to block all the multicolored light, not allowing it to attack.\u201cStrike its stomach!\u201d shouted Shi Yi once again. His eyes were now like two burning divine lamps. The aura that circulated around him could make many people palpitate in fear.With another\u00a0honglong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the Archaic vicious bird rapidly and viciously flung its tail feathers towards the chest of the vicious beast. Unfortunately, it failed once again and was almost countered by that huge beast claw, leaving it no choice but to rapidly retreat.\u201cNot good, his speed is too fast!\u201d Sweat dripped from Shi Yi\u2019s forehead. He kept pointing out the weaknesses, however Shi Ziling was incredibly calm and incomparably indifferent. His actions were like lightning, and his control over his precious technique was nimble and masterful without any points to exploit.Shi Yi had dual pupils and was able to see the origin of many things. He saw the weaknesses, but his the speed at which he pointed them out was fundamentally unable to compete with Shi Ziling\u2019s speed.\u201cFifth elder, you\u2019re not enough!\u201d Shi Ziling said. Even more splendid light exploded forth from within his body. That figure of the huge beast rapidly expanded and then exploded into the symbols of the Archaic vicious beast. They rushed in and fused with his body.His radiance was magnificent as he walked forward with his battle spear in hand. With every step, he shook the earth. He rapidly thrusted forward with the battle spear, and golden light penetrated that Archaic vicious bird, killing it immediately.Hong!The tip of the golden spear changed direction and struck forward once again. Shi Yuan exposed his fearful face, but it was already too late. Symbols wrapped around the spear tip and penetrated his shoulders.Shi Yuan released a huge scream. He exhausted all the strength within his body and concentrated all the symbols toward his shoulder. It was incredibly dazzling and magnificent. He flew backwards and interweaved his mysterious symbols to stop the sound from expanding. A shining and bloody hole appeared through the front and back where the spear penetrated.If it was anyone else, their entire body would certainly have split apart before exploding. Even if they were more powerful, that arm would most likely be completely smashed apart, however, Shi Yuan had a shocking precious technique that could freeze his wounds. Although it was half crippled, at least his arm wasn\u2019t smashed apart.Even so, he had already lost his fighting strength. His entire body seemed like it had aged roughly ten years. He had abruptly fallen into the realm of ordinary men, as it was tough for him to fight every again.Their clan elder lost the fight. In Shi Yuan\u2019s family, no one was a match for Shi Ziling. This was simply too mind blowing. How old was he? He was only twenty or so this year, yet he already thoroughly suppressed the strongest people within the tribe!The scene was completely silent. Shi Yuan\u2019s family was dreadful.Shi Ziling walked forward one step at a time. The golden battle spear in his hand was pointed forward as he stared at Shi Yi and said, \u201cMy dear nephew, it was you that told your mother that little Hao had a Supreme Being Bone within his body right? How considerate of you.\u201dShi Yi didn\u2019t say anything and stood where he was. The divine light within his eyes dimmed.\u201cThe tribe has to punish you mother. You\u2019re threatening suicide so she doesn\u2019t get killed right? I\u2019m curious as to whether or not you really would slit a knife through your own throat if I kill her today.\u201d Shi Ziling calmly said.\u201cClan elders, why are you still not doing anything?\u201d A few people shouted.Shi Ziling didn\u2019t turned around at all. He knew that the instant he made his move, the clan elder had already appeared and sealed off the entire palace with the precious bones of Archaic Descendants, preventing the sounds of shouting and battling to transmit outside.\u201cZiling, thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes, it\u2019s all our mistakes. This vicious woman is here, it\u2019s up to you how you want to deal with her; however, you can\u2019t touch little Yi.\u201d At this moment, several clan elders appeared together.Each of them had shockingly powerful abilities. They were all old senior elders who had lived in seclusion for many years, and they were several generations older than Shi Ziling. Their eyes were all splendid like little suns as they were the true experts of the tribe.In front of them, there was a woman who was bound together and was currently being escorted forward.\u201cSister-in-law, is your heart red or is it actually black?\u201d Shi Ziling clenched his teeth and then shouted loudly, \u201cAble to be so cruel and unscrupulous!\u201dNot far away, Shi Yi had an indifferent expression. His double pupils were shining and emitting an incomparably terrifying aura. There was unexpectedly a bone chilling wind that made everyone shiver.Shi Ziling continued and said \u201cI told you already. You break one of my son\u2019s bones, I\u2019ll break a hundred of your son\u2019s bones. Today, not even the Sovereign from Heaven will be able to stop me!\u201dThe young woman raised her head and held an ice-cold expression on her face. She said nothing, but her heart was indeed full of fear and regret. Their family had obviously already sent out many of their most powerful experts to kill this couple, how could they have still be alive?\u201cI\u2019ll let your own eyes bear witness!\u201d Shi Ziling shouted and then abruptly turned around to face Shi Yi. He raised his golden battle spear, and as if it was a metal rod, he prepared to throw it.\u201cYou dare!\u201d Some of the clan elders were furious.\u201cZiling, stay your hand. You can\u2019t hurt little Yi, anything else can be discussed!\u201d Other clan elders also shouted.\u201cShi Ziling, are you rebelling?!\u201d The clan elders who were more partial towards Shi Yuan were shouting even louder.All these people blocked him at the same time and immediately used their heaven-shocking precious techniques, illuminating the entire sky.\u201cSo what if I rebel? What I say goes. No one will stop me!\u201d Shi Ziling shouted loudly. He continued to swing the golden battle spear in his hand without changing directions, directly smashing towards where Shi Yi was.However, the group of tribe elders stood in his way with all kinds of precious techniques were activated. Symbols sealed the direction where the spear descended.Shi Ziling shook his arm, and incomparably complicated symbols began to interweave and descend along with the golden battle spear, emitting a strange power.\u201cNot good!\u201d All the clan elders were gob smacked.They felt a hidden force penetrate straight through their precious techniques, heading straight for Shi Yi. Although the power continuously weakened as it passed through them, it was still very frightening.\u201cThis\u2026 what is this precious technique?\u201d They were fearful since the tribe had no records on it. It was extremely strange, and unexpectedly passed through their bodies and precious techniques as it traveled forward. Even if they wanted to stop it, it was too late.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dShi Yi released a blood-curdling scream. His entire body flew across horizontally into a rock garden. Blood was all over his body, and the bones within his body began to crack and pop. Over a hundred of his bones were broken instantly.\u201cLittle Yi!\u201d The young woman was dreadful and shouted out in fear. Then, she suddenly lifted her head and released a vicious aura while staring at Shi Ziling. She coldly said \u201cMy father and the others won\u2019t let you go!\u201dChi!Golden rays of light flickered and Shi Ziling indifferently tossed out the golden battle spear in his hand. With a pu\u00a0sound,\u00a0it penetrated her body and sent her flying. She traveled over ten feet away, and her body was nailed onto the floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even with several clan elders fighting together, they surprisingly still couldn\u2019t stop Shi Ziling. He was like an unstoppable god of war as he bathed in the splendid radiance between the heaven and earth.The young woman was drenched in blood while pinned to the ground. That golden spear was still vibrating, and this killing attack was incomparably terrifying.Over a hundred bones within Shi Yi had snapped. His entire body was drenched in cold sweat as he lifted his head to see the young woman. His dual pupils immediately shot out two astonishing beams of light as he shouted in an overcast manner.This was absolutely not the voice of a child. That was an ice-cold, angry, and tyrannical voice that sent chills down everyone\u2019s spines.Shi Ziling was astonished. Although his strongest attack was ninety percent mitigated by several clan elders, it wasn\u2019t something that a normal person could live through.It was merely a child who wasn\u2019t even four years old, yet he was already this astonishing. Although hundreds of bones had been broken, he became increasingly tyrannical as his divine furnace burned even brighter on the verge of death.\u201cLittle Yi!\u201dSeveral clan elders shouted loudly and became several flashes of electricity. They immediately surrounded him and guarded all sides. They were previously terrified, as this was a child who possessed the dual pupils of the saints and a fused Supreme Being Bone. He was destined for greatness, and in the future, he would rule this ancient country; how could they lose him?\u201cZiling, how can you act like this?\u201d A few clan elders shouted.\u201cShi Ziling, you overstepped your bounds and had the heart to attack little Yi. Do you truly have a heart of a stone, and want to cripple our tribe\u2019s future?\u201d The voice of the clan elders who were partial towards Shi Yuan were even more severe as they berated.The group of were all worried. The dual pupiled child cannot be allowed to die. The natural born Supreme Being Bone also could not disappear, otherwise, the loss would be disastrous. This was their clan\u2019s pride that they placed their futures on.\u201cWho feels pity for my child then?\u201d Shi Ziling calmed said. That cold intention, that tone of voice and that expression made others tremble. They clearly invoked his wrath.The little guy was originally intelligent, adorable and was born with a Supreme Being Bone. ly, he could have looked down on both the heavens and the earth, but in the end, his precious bone was taken away from him. His body went through severe atrophy, to the point where he couldn\u2019t recognize the most intimate people in his life, and couldn\u2019t even speak a single world. He was at his last breath, and even his life couldn\u2019t be guaranteed.How could he be willing, how could he not be angry? Shi Ziling was spiteful and mad. After hearing these condemnations, his eyes became terrifyingly cold. Who would pity the little guy, why didn\u2019t they care about him?Two golden rays of light shot out of his eyes as if they were lightning streaking across the air, shocking the group of people into retreat. They were speechless, and a portion of the clan elders were silently ashamed.\u201cThe little guy is really pitiful\u2026\u201d Finally, one of them sighed and stated.Not only did the naturally born Supreme Being Bone not bring glory and splendor to the clan, he was even back-stabbed. It was truly lamentable. What kind of naive and kindhearted child could make others feel so sad?\u201cZiling, no matter what, please stop what you\u2019re doing!\u201d An elder urged.The other clan elders crouched to examine the state Shi Yi\u2019s body was in. As long as he wasn\u2019t dead, they would treat his wounds no matter how high the price was.Strands of multicolored light seeped out of Shi Yi\u2019s eyes. It was a strange sight. It slowly wrapped up his body like a cocoon and nourished his body. After some\u00a0pi pa\u00a0sounds, his broken bones actually returned back to their original positions.Although they couldn\u2019t be connected immediately, his body was no longer soft, and he could already sit up. His eyes were as deep as a sea of stars as his dual pupils emitted a mysterious power and continuously released multicolored light.This astonished many people and sent them into a state of stupor.\u201cSuch a powerful dual pupil individual. It\u2019s even more powerful than the legends!\u201d After the fearful events, some clan elders couldn\u2019t control their admiration.With a\u00a0weng\u00a0sound,\u00a0his chest began to flicker and brim with holy light, solidifying all of his bloody wounds. Furthermore, his bones began to move rhythmically all over to the tune of a divine sound, as if they were slowly growing well again.This was the power of the Supreme Being Bone. The people were stunned; it hadn\u2019t even been two weeks, yet it was this already this terrifying. It truly lived up to its reputation!Shi Ziling\u2019s heart was in pain. This was little Hao\u2019s bone, but it unexpectedly displayed such a shocking effect in the body of another person. If it fully matured, how heaven defying would it be?\u201cZiling, give up,\u201d advised a clan elder.\u201cShi Ziling just retrain yourself now. If not, you\u2019ll be put down today!\u201d Those clan elders who were biased towards Shi Yuan weren\u2019t courteous at all, and their eyes were full of cold intentions.Shi Ziling waved his hand and the battle spear that was nailed into the ground was pulled out. Golden rays of light burned magnificently, and with a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, it brought with it a blossoming string of blood as it returned.\u201cMother!\u201d Shi Yi loudly called out. He unexpectedly left the bosoms of the clan elder and rushed over. His eyes emitted a light with divine splendor that terrified others as he wished to mend that body.However, before he even approached, the young woman let out a wretched scream as a small portion of her body exploded.Meanwhile, Shi Ziling took large strides forward and pointed his battle spear forwards with his imposing killing intent.A clan elder held Shi Yi back immediately and rapidly retreated. Shi Ziling was like a demon king right now, and he would kill everything that blocked his way; they had to avoid the tip of that spear.\u201cTo the several ancestral elders here, you guys were here a long time ago. Why haven\u2019t you shown your face until now?\u201d Shi Ziling suddenly said.The mansion had been shrouded by hazy light a long time ago. It was the precious bones of an Archaic Descendant that locked this entire area up, preventing the battle and shouting noises from leaking out.Four elders appeared, and they each appeared in a different corner. They sat upon the palace, and mist curled up around them. They appeared to be hazy and indistinct, as if they were primordial gods that appeared before the heavens were created. They were so terrifying that it made people shudder in fear.They didn\u2019t make any actions, but they certainly suppressed all four directions.\u201cBefore I entered the mansion and had the chance to take action, you guys already locked down this entire area. Since it already turned out like this, why won\u2019t you guys take action?\u201d Shi Ziling asked.His eyes were filled with anger. As soon as he returned to his mansion, he felt a strangeness and peculiarity. The supreme experts within the clan had already begun plotting everything before he even went wild.\u201cZiling, put everything behind for now. In ten years, you will govern our Stone Clan.\u201d An ancestral elder said.\u201cTo let me keep the seat warm for little Yi and hand it over to him in twenty years?\u201d said Shi Ziling with an indifferent voice as he turned to look at his wife and child. His child was born with a Supreme Being Bone, yet he fell to such an extent. Right now, he had absolutely nothing.\u201cZiling, you already killed many people. You should be done venting already. Just give up.\u201d spoke and ancestral elder.\u201cI can. Just return the Supreme Being Bone back to my child!\u201d Shi Ziling shouted loudly.The four ancestral elders were silent as they sat in their spiral position. Mist curled around them, making them barely visible and indistinct like the chaos before the birth of the world. However, their seemingly hidden yet terrifying aura trembled the heaven and earth.\u201cShi Ziling, you\u2019re being too excessive. Do you know who you\u2019re talking to? Those are our clan\u2019s ancestral elders, do you even have a shred of respect left?!\u201d shouted a few elders.\u201cF*ck off!\u201d Shi Ziling shouted. Even the clan elders lost to him, how could this ordinary elder who depended on others still dare to provoke him? With a poke of his spear, divine light was released in ten thousand directions. A thousand different colors were displayed, and golden symbols pressed outwards like the sea. With a\u00a0pu sound,\u00a0that person\u2019s exploded on the spot and only left behind a blood mist.\u201cShi Ziling, the clan have not been unkind towards you. This ancestral elders still promises that you\u2019ll have control of the clan after ten years. How are you still unsatisfied?\u201d A clan elder grimly stated.\u201cTry and say this same bullshit after someone takes a sword and beheads your son!\u201d said Shi Ziling without a trace of politeness.\u201cThen there\u2019s no other way but to put you down and banish you into the wild and bitter lands!\u201d a person shouted.An extremely imposing elder walked forward and concentrated all of his spirit to fiercely battle Shi Ziling with the intention of capturing him. The entire area suddenly overflowed with divine light, and the entire heaven and earth lit up as it received the embrace of this resplendent radiance.However, this imposing elder still flew out in the end while spitting out large chunks of blood. He suffered a serious injury and was almost cut into pieces.The clan\u2019s experts all came, but upon seeing this, their hearts shuddered. Shi Ziling was truly too powerful. It really was too unfortunate to banish such an outstanding person.The clan elders were all emotionally stirred, but there were still some people who took action. All of a sudden, three of them walked forward while activating their precious techniques to attack him.Immediately, this entire place was filled with deafening and ear-splitting noise. Divine light tore through the heavens, and thunder roiling like the ocean. The killing intent was incredibly severe as they destroyed the entire place. All kinds of holy light danced in the air as their supreme precious techniques wreaked havoc.\u201cShi Ziling, you have so much nerve. Do you intend to betray and destroy our clan?\u201d The clan elders who were biased toward Shi Yuan shouted and took large steps forward with the intention of entering the battle.\u201cNinth grand elder carry me!\u201d Suddenly Shi Yi spoke and and told a clan elder to bring him into the battle.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Shi Li was amazed.\u201cI have dual pupils. I can instill my mysterious powers into your body and assist you while fighting!\u201d Shi Yi said to him quietly while leaning towards his ear.Shi Li immediately carried him and discharged his symbols while wrapping him within. The two suddenly felt like they were connected together. He felt an acute pain within both his eyes and then he was able to see through everything. All the precious techniques and attacks became slower in front of his eyes.Even though he was a clan elder and had a noble status, he was still shocked. This child was truly inconceivable. He was so young, yet he had such a remarkable precious technique and ability.With a\u00a0shua\u00a0sound,\u00a0Shi Li rushed into battle and launched his attack. His eyes were brilliant like the blazing sun, and were able to see through every opening as he took his tyrannical and violent actions.Chi!A precious technique activated, and gorgeous symbols converged together into a dagger shaped like a Flood Dragon covered in dense scales and sinister claws. It rushed forward with its tip in front and streaked past Shi Ziling\u2019s hair, cutting off a black strand.\u201cGood!\u201d Shi Li achieved success with just a single strike, so he was immediately pleasantly surprised. He secretly muttered to let few other people cooperatively carry Shi Yi in order to launch an unrivaled and powerful killing blow.Shi Yi\u2019s dual pupils began to emit like as he leaned on the back of a clan elder. He coldly stared at the figure of the golden war god who stood in the midst of the battlefield. Although he was still very young, the gaze in his eyes could already make people\u2019s heart beat irregularly.The four clan elders had a huge and incredibly intense battle with Shi Ziling. The onlooking clansmen were all fearful in the face of the disaster.Weng!Suddenly, Shi Yi began to transmit a sound. With the cooperation of the clan elder, he drew out a huge amount of his spirit essence to nourish his own body. His dual pupil discharged a light that shot forth a bunch of densely packed symbols into the air. It was unexpected able to influence all the precious technique in the area, and greatly interfered with Shi Ziling\u2019s attack.\u201cSo powerful!\u201d Many people cried out in alarm.\u201cAlthough this child is still young, he\u2019s truly complicated!\u201d \u00a0This made all the elders who sat in the mist from afar stare widely.Hong!A multicolored light blazed magnificently, and the four great elders\u2019 attacks were like howling winds and torrential rain, and their precious techniques shocked the heavens. Shi Ziling\u2019s body flashed, and his precious technique was interrupted and he was almost met with a disaster. His eyes suddenly became ice-cold as he stared forward.\u201cProtect little Yi well!\u201d shouted a clan elder with fear swaying in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I believe they\u2019ve purposely allowed a hundred of little Yi\u2019s bones break earlier because they were allowing Shi Ziling to vent out a bit of his anger.\u201d Another clan elder calm and collectedly said.Shi Ziling held his battle spear and flew forth like a demonic god. After a long whistle, a huge Archaic Vicious beast emerged from within his body and followed him in his killing path.Xiu!Shi Yi raised head. His eyes were deep and profound as if the sun and the moon rotated within them, and a river of stars fell in between; extremely terrifying. Soon afterwards, he released two beams of magnificent light forged out of symbols. The symbols were densely packed, and they violently shot into the sky.Once again, he sent the heaven and earth into chaos to interfere with Shi Ziling\u2019s technique, however this time, it was useless. With a sweep of his golden battle spear, the heaven and earth began to rumble. Ten thousand golden waves surged forth and crushed each and every corner.With a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound,\u00a0several clan elders began to spit out blood as they were swept away. After Shi Li landed, he began to stagger, spitting out blood with every step. He almost allowed Shi Yi to fly away as his body shuddered from nearly falling over.Hou\u2026\u00a0By Shi Ziling\u2019s side, that Archaic Vicious Beast was also displaying its earth-shaking might. Its demonic aura was like the sea as it began to spread into every direction.The four clan elders were shaken once again, and they spat out blood.\u201cKeep fighting!\u201dThe four rushed forward and attacked together.These several individuals were engaged in an intense battle. Their precious technique rushed into the heavens and shook every direction. Intense rays of light flourished as Shi Ziling had the appearance of a golden war god. Under the combined attack of the four experts, he was unexpectedly able to gain the upper hand!The great battle reached its climax, and the four clan elders\u2019 clothes were all dyed with blood. However, as the battle went on, Shi Ziling became even more valiant. His divine splendor overflowed into the heavens as it oppressed and suffocated those people.Suddenly, a terrifying wave of fluctuation began to emit from Shi Li\u2019s body as if an Archaic Divine Monarch was appearing. It shook the vast heavens and the earth, and his chest was emitting light.\u201cHuh?\u201d Shi Ziling was shocked.This was too sudden. This terrifying strength was able to oppress everything. It even surprisingly stopped the golden battle spear and obliterated that Archaic Vicious Beast by Shi Ziling\u2019s side.The divine light within Shi Ziling\u2019s eyes began to increase dramatically. By shooting out two golden rays of lightning from within his eyes, he was able to scatter that terrifying fluctuation. The battle spear within his hands once again lit up with light, and a large cluster of symbols rotated about is as it exerted its intimidation in every direction.Hong!The golden battle spear pierced forward as if it were penetrating the heaven and earth. The chants of deities began to sound as the incredibly divine and genuine radiance sprinkled everywhere. He was using an attack to defend himself!Shi Li\u2019s attack was truly terrifying, and it was almost as if he was one with Shi Yi. His chest began to emit light, and complicated net-like patterns covered his body as it circulated various heavenly mysteries.That aura was too terrifying. It shook the other three clan elders until they all spat out blood and began to retreat. It overwhelmed all of them, because even though this attack wasn\u2019t directed at them, they still felt such a strong backlash.In the distance, all the spectators felt like they were struck by a hammer. All of their bodies began to tremble, and they couldn\u2019t help but stagger backwards. The people who were a bit closer had blood coming out of the corner of their mouths and their breathing practically stopped. They couldn\u2019t help but feel the need to kneel and bow.\u201cIt\u2019s little Hao\u2019s Supreme Being Bone!\u201d Shi Ziling\u2019s gaze suddenly turned as cold as possible as his anger reached its peak.Shi Li carried Shi Yi on his back. The two of them together forcefully operated that bone to utilize its divine might, shaking everyone in every direction with no exceptions.However, with just this one attack. Shi Li\u2019s spirit essence was completely empty. He couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and began to continuously cough out blood. His body began to swing to and fro as cracks began to appear throughout.As for Shi Yi who was on his back, his chest began to emit\u00a0kacha\u00a0sounds. The bones which returned back into place began to jolt out again. He suffered serious damage from the backlash since the Supreme Being Bone wasn\u2019t completely matured yet and shouldn\u2019t be used like this.Shi Ziling was vigorously blazed all over with golden light. He stood over the entire sky and was so powerful that it made people shudder. He was actually unaffected by the precious bone\u2019s attack as he continued to force his way forward.Dong!With each step, the heavens and the earth trembled. He was like a death god who broke out from his fetters, bringing about an aura of misfortune. His entire body emitted bone-splitting killing intent as his spear swept forward.The three clan elders were sent flying. Their bodies were bloody all over as they fell in between a group of people. They were unable to crawl back up again as many of their bones were broken, and they had difficulty using their symbols.As for Shi Li, he had to face Shi Ziling\u2019s most powerful attack. The spear tip began to radiate and fly into the sky like a golden Flood Dragon. It penetrated through his protective precious technique and spilt a great deal of his fresh blood.Pu,\u00a0a small chunk of his body exploded. The sharp pain caused him to tremble, and his symbols were immediately obliterated. They were completely ineffective, and fear was written all of his face.Like an ancient god king, Shi Ziling was bathed in radiance all over. He took a step forward and pointed his golden battle spear forward with the intention of piercing both Shi Li and Shi Yi and impaling them into the ground.\u201cZiling, you should restrain yourself now.\u201d Precisely at this moment, the ancestral elder on the east suddenly made his move. He was still sitting just a moment ago, but he arrived in front of them like a streak of lightning. His entire body emitted a mist, and his figure was indistinct. He stretched a hand forward to block that terrifying spear tip in order to protect those two people.In actuality, they were always here. From the moment Shi Ziling stepped into the mansion, they made their move and sealed this entire region.At the earliest moment when Shi Ziling stepped into the clan, he felt a weird atmosphere. He sensed the aura of the four ancestral elders and immediately had a terrible premonition.The four had extremely deep cultivation, and it was difficult to sense just how deep it was. As long as they were here, it was far too difficult to rely on force to achieve justice. It was absolutely unknown just how long they had cultivated for.\u201cAncestors, is this how you administer justice?\u201d Shi Ziling shouted.\u201cI know that you feel wronged. The entire clan feels sorry towards little Hao, but please believe us when we say that we will certainly make it up to you.\u201d the ancestral elders said.At this precise moment, mist began to fill the air and the other three ancestral elders also appeared, trapping him in the middle while remaining silent.\u201cI refuse!\u201d Shi Ziling roared loudly. His entire body began to emit light and the golden spear within his hand tilted toward the south sky. Symbols surged forth as he activated his supreme precious technique to initiate a battle once again.No one could contain their emotions. He dared to fight with the ancestral elders. This was the first time in clan history where someone dared to act like this! Shi Ziling\u2019s power shocked everyone!\u201cZiling, you\u2019re being too excessive. If you insist on fighting, then don\u2019t blame us for putting you down!\u201d An ancestral elder said.\u201cThen let\u2019s fight!\u201d Shi Ziling waved his battle spear again as his entire body brightened. Symbols began to interweave and an Archaic Vicious Beast rushed forth. This world-shaking precious technique was his most powerful attack.The day seemed to have been torn apart as the dazzling holy light obscured the entire area. No one could face it head on, and everyone was trembling without exception. They felt the need to kneel in face of this divine power.\u201cSuppress him!\u201d The ancestral elders took action.The most terrifying battle was currently happening at this place. It shook the heavens and the earth, shaking everyone to the core. Everyone\u2019s soul was shivering uncontrollably as they felt waves of fear.\u201cI can\u2019t see\u2026\u201d In front of the Stone Village\u2019s big willow tree, the little guy\u2019s face was full of tears, and he couldn\u2019t see that battle.\u201cSince you were too young, you couldn\u2019t see those series of fights.\u201d The willow tree\u2019s voice sounded. Chaotic air began to fill the atmosphere and this place was still in a state of indistinct haziness.\u201cI want to keep looking. I need to know the results.\u201d The little guy tightly clenched his fists. Although he knew these things happened a long time ago, he was still feeling nervous.The stone mansion was filled with a dazzling splendor. All kinds of holy light flew about while it overshadowing the daylight. It covered the entire mansion, and it was absolutely impossible to see anything else.\u201cTwo hearts beat as one!\u201d Finally, the little guy\u2019s mother entered the battle as well. She held him as she entered the battlefield to cooperate with Shi Ziling, and they were going to activate a precious technique that could shake the entire empire.Unfortunately, the little guy couldn\u2019t see anything. The only thing that entered his eyes was the light caused by the precious technique. It was gorgeous to the point of making people\u2019s hearts shudder. The entire world was dyed in a faint gold by this divine and holy light.Finally, he passed out in his mother\u2019s bosoms because he was too weak. Right before he shut his large eyes, he saw his young older brother on the outskirts of the battle.Although Shi Yi had many of his bones broken, his spiritual essence did not weaken. His dual pupils were still deep and profound as he stared at Shi Ziling with a chilly look. Then he turned to look at the little guy and a smirk was formed at his mouth. His eyes contained a glittering radiance that shunned the entire world. After looking at the little guy for only a moment, he lost interest.Since the little guy was at his last breath and lost his Supreme Being Bone, his life was basically lost and was unworthy of his interest.For a long time after that, the little guy was in a dizzy state. He lingered around on the brink of life and death, and was became incredibly weak. His life force seemed like it could dry up at any moment and he didn\u2019t know what was happening in front of him at all.Once he woke up again, he had already arrived in a wild and desolate land that was far away from the vast ancient country. They had left the bustling empire to a place that held a world of difference.They arrived at a large shabby manor. This was the recovery place for the ancestors of the Stone Family, and could be considered as a second ancestral land.\u201cZiling, you\u2019re truly exceptional!\u201d An elder with white hair and bear patted his old desk in excitement. He was also furious and said, \u201cIf I was fifty years younger and had your power, I would wreak havoc within the empire as well. They dare to bully the people of our family?!\u201dShi Ziling shook head and his face was somewhat pale.An elderly old man opened his mouth and said, \u201cTo go as far as sending you to this bitter land, they are truly excessive. You\u2019re still so young!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They call this their second ancestral land, but what is it really? It\u2019s cold and barren. This place isn\u2019t a happy paradise at all, and it absolutely isn\u2019t suitable for long term cultivation.This shabby second ancestral land was located on the outskirts of the desolate lands. Only those who committed huge blunders or provoked some huge disaster would be exiled to this place.\u201cThis was the agreement I had with them. Little Hao is to be raised here.\u201d Shi Ziling said.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same thing? You\u2019re being exiled to this place!\u201d An elder angrily said, and then asked in confusion, \u201cWhat did they give you after all was said and done?\u201d\u201cIf little Hao could recover his exuberant life force, they would return his Supreme Being Bone right away.\u201d Shi Ziling said.\u201cChild, how can you believe such things? This is just their way of stalling. With little Hao\u2019s injuries like this, even if he could live on, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t be able to nourish a Supreme Being Bone!\u201d The elder beat his chest and stamped his feet.Apart from the servants here, there were four special elders. They were all characters who were once famed for their outstanding performance and had extremely high positions in the family. The only thing was that they committed some huge mistakes in the past, and were exiled to this wild and desolate land.If not for the fact that they didn\u2019t want to make their heirs\u2019 lives complicated, they would have escaped a long time ago since their cultivation levels were extremely frightening. Many years passed by in a flash, and those people were already in their declining years without much time left.\u201cThe four elders gave me a ruined drawing behind everyone\u2019s back and told me if I could find the real ancestral land of our clan, then perhaps little Hao could recover there.\u201d said Shi Ziling lightly.A look of concern lingered over his wife who stood at the side while holding the weak little guy. A smile hadn\u2019t appear on her beautiful face for a long time.\u201cWhat, our clan\u2019s real ancestral land?\u201d Several elders all widened their eyes since that wasn\u2019t an ordinary place. There were many mysteries and legends that talked about the first ancestors of the Stone Clan originating from that place. They founded the endless glory and established the ancient country.Those people were all excited. That ancestral land was attached to the hearts of many people within the Stone Clan. It held many mysteries, and there were rumors of that place being able to give birth to saints! However, their ancestors severed connections with that place, and it became impossible to find.\u201cIs that real or fake, they\u2019re not lying to you right?\u201d One of the elders wasn\u2019t very convinced.\u201cNo matter what, I have to give it a try and use my greatest effort to restore Hao\u2019er!\u201d Shi Ziling\u2019s face was unwavering and determined.\u201cWhat if you can\u2019t find it?\u201d An elder mentioned.\u201cThen I\u2019ll look for an ancient sacred mountain within the vast reaches of the wasteland and find a divine medicine. I absolutely won\u2019t allow Hao\u2019er to fall into oblivion like this!\u201d Shi Ziling said.His wife who stood by his side nodded. Her beautiful eyes was brimming with determination as she held the little guy.The elders immediately jumped in fear. They all opened their mouths and solemnly warned.\u201cZiling, don\u2019t just randomly do things. An ancient sacred mountain isn\u2019t a place you can just randomly walk into. There might be a Genuine Hou, Golden Winged Peng and those types of creatures living there. You\u2019d be throwing your life away!\u201dShi Ziling was always researching that diagram. If it wasn\u2019t his last resort, he naturally wouldn\u2019t step into an ancient sacred mountain. He still hoped that he could find the ancestral land.\u201cIf Hao\u2019er died, then my life and death struggle with them will be imminent. I will kill until their world is turned upside down!\u201d Shi Ziling\u2019s gaze was terrifying as he exposed his frightening aura.\u201cAccording to the promise, Hao\u2019er should remain here in order to recover. They acted like this because they don\u2019t feel at ease around you. This is their way of putting you under control, and they fear that you might go back and start killing everything\u201d said an elder.\u201cI won\u2019t allow Hao\u2019er to stay here!\u201d Shi Ziling naturally wasn\u2019t that type of inflexible person.\u201cLet\u2019s do this, let\u2019s not give them any excuses. If we can\u2019t be certain whether or not you can cure Hao\u2019er, then we\u2019ll find a child as a substitute. In the future, we must get back that Supreme Being Bone!\u201d\u2026Afterwards, Shi Ziling and his wife experienced countless trials and tribulations in order to find Stone Village. When they saw the scorched black willow tree, they were truly shocked. They were very powerful, so they naturally found out that this tree was extraordinary.However, they were disappointed at everything else in Stone Village.A gust of wind blew by and dispersed the mist. Under the willow tree, the little guy stood in isolation with tears all over his face.After a long while, the willow tree finally asked him, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\u201cMy heart aches so much. Father, mother, where are you right now?\u201d The little guy continuously wept.\u201cYou really are a kindhearted child, you aren\u2019t aroused by the hatred, and you haven\u2019t lost your reasoning to seek revenge.\u201d The willow tree transmitted its voice through, and then it said once again, \u201cYou lost the Supreme\u00a0Being Bone, don\u2019t you hate it? The brilliance of Shi Yi will certainly be world-shaking. He would be enveloped in endless divine glory, and an ordinary person could never hope to look up to him.The little guy naturally knew that Shi Yi\u2019s destiny was bound to surpass ordinary people, and \u00a0he could picture Shi Yi\u2019s glory transcending the earth.He calmed replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a bone? Supreme Being isn\u2019t a title that can be bestowed, it\u2019s not something that a piece bone can decide. It\u2019s something that you create yourself by taking one step at a time.\u201d\u201cSince you are able to speak such words, then I\u2019ll tell you a secret.\u201d \u00a0The willow tree was very happy and reassuring.\u201cWhat secret?\u201d The little guy was astonished.\u201cHave you ever seen wilted grass and dried wood prosper again?\u201d asked the willow tree.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Perfect WorldCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 \u2013 The True Primordial Record\u201cI\u2019ve obviously seen it before.\u201d The little guy lightly nodded and quietly said.\u201cAutumn winds will shed yellow leaves, wildfires will burn the withered greenery. Winter winds will whistle past, new branches will arrive with the spring scenery,\u201d spoke the willow tree.Wilted grass and dried wood prospering again was a natural occurrence, but right now, this was extremely emotionally touching for the little guy. He understood what the willow tree meant.\u201cWillow deity, are you saying that one day the Supreme Being Bone within my body will be reborn?\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes were brightly lit with tears. A vigorous surge of life emerged from within his softness and immaturity.\u201cNothing is absolute. I\u2019m only saying it\u2019s a possibility.\u201d The willow tree didn\u2019t deny it.The little guy immediately clenched his little fists and his eyes were blinking brightly. He gained a sense of yearning and expectation.Although he was optimistic, he didn\u2019t believe that a single Supreme Being Bone could determine a person\u2019s life. However, after recalling that he was originally born with a power that rivaled a Genuine Hou or a Golden Winged Peng, yet it was cruelly stolen from him and bloodily implanted into the body of another, it still made gave him a sense of loss.Right now, a single beam of light was shining down onto his heart, making him feel so much more joy and invigorated his fighting spirit even more.\u201cWillow Deity, can you explain in more detail? Help guide me on the correct path.\u201d The little guy\u2019s big spirited eyes were black and white. His appearance was quite immature, yet it was still rather brilliant.\u201cTo be honest, there isn\u2019t much to be said. The most simple and ordinary principles are gathered in the most common objects. When an ancient tree snaps, perhaps it might die because its life force had been exhausted. On the other hand, when chives are planted, they seem to be yellow and frail at first. However, after being planted again and again, it becomes increasingly dense and green, gradually thickening. And then there is the silkworm. If it\u2019s trapped within its cocoon, it would only be stifled to death and killed. However, if it managed to break out, it would transform into a butterfly, bright and beautiful. This is a once in a life-time nirvana, detaching itself from its past.\u201dThe Willow Deity calmed spoke. The news wasn\u2019t very astonishing since these were only ordinary events.The little guy\u2019s large eyes then began to become brighter. He looked as the scorched black trunk, as well as its only tender green branch and said, \u201cLike Willow Deity, who shined with opportunity through destruction. The Willow Deity will grow even more powerful, and this is a type of refinement, as well as a unique way of cultivation. After nirvana, you will far exceed everyone else.\u201d\u201cYour comprehension is very good, but as for my situation\u2026 it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t make any more wild assumptions.\u201d The Willow Deity spoke with a faint trace of smiling expression. It was rare for its expression to fluctuate.\u201cWillow Deity, was it you who saved me?\u201d The little guy seemed like he thought of something. He was so feeble back then, and his body seriously degenerated to the point that he almost perished.The mountain wind breezed by and that sparkling green branch swayed. The willow said, \u201cIf I bestowed you with an opportunity to live, you would only have been able to survive. You would have had to live the rest of your life ordinarily. At first, I only watched quietly.\u201d\u201cI survived by myself?\u201d The little guy was astounded.\u201cCorrect, when you almost withered, your life force began to reconstruct and strengthened bit by bit until you finally straightened it up yourself without my interference.\u201d replied the willow tree honestly.\u201cWilted grass and dried wood prospering again. So it turns out that I endured it myself.\u201d The little guy began to understand, and his large onyx eyes shined even brighter.When the willow tree watched the little guy\u2019s withered life began to reborn, it was somewhat emotionally moved. Its situation was similar to the little guy, and was able to sympathize with him through similar pains.\u201cI must also warn you, nothing is absolute. \u00a0Although you survived by relying on yourself and invigorated your own life force, being able to give birth to another Supreme Being Bone is whole different story.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201d The little guy carefully nodded and wasn\u2019t optimistically ignorant, because he had still never felt the appearance of a Supreme Being Bone appear in his body.The Willow Deity spoke again: \u201cHowever, once it\u2019s reborn, it\u2019ll be destined to surpass the past. Your foundation will undergo nirvana, and your symbols will become even more complete and mysterious, containing even more divine powers. It will surpass the past and be completely different!\u201dThe chaotic mist dispersed and the village entrance was clearly and peacefully restored. A streak of golden light scuttled near, and Hairy Ball who seemed like a plump golden fist landed on the little guy\u2019s shoulder, endless crying out with\u00a0zhi zhi\u00a0sounds.The chief and the group of other people all surrounded him when they saw the tears on the little guy\u2019s face. Linhu\u2019s wife and various others all began to comfort him as they wiped away his tears. They were all extremely caring towards him.\u201cLittle guy, this place is your home. No matter what kind of past experiences you went though, we\u2019re all your family.\u201d said a group of middle-aged men.Then a group of elders extended their rough hands as well and rubbed his head. Their mouths split open and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Our Stone Village had even given birth to a deity. In the future, you\u2019ll certainly be able to compete with experts on the level of the Archaic Devil Bird \u2014 Golden Winged Peng. You must understand, that\u2019s an existence able to kill even gods.\u201d\u201cLittle guy, don\u2019t cry. You have us too. We\u2019re all brothers who have grown up together. Whatever happens in the future, we\u2019ll shoulder it together!\u201d The group of children also shouted.\u201cEn!\u201d The little guy wiped his tears dry and nodded with all his might. The villagers were all kind towards him and let him grow up joyfully and happily. His childhood wasn\u2019t filled with hatred or regret at all.Of course, he would inevitably walk into that ancient country in the future and demand an explanation!\u201cGrandpa, I want to become stronger!\u201d The little guy had never thirsted for more power like he had today. However, his cultivation had reached its limits within Stone Village. There was nothing else he could learn here.But that ancient country controlled millions of millions of li, and it had incredibly vast mountains and rivers as well as a population of over billions. With such an unimaginable number, there would inevitably be many geniuses in every generation that had world-shocking powers.His \u2018little older brother\u2019 was even more of a bright blazing sun. His radiance was destined to illuminate the great earth. He was born with dual pupils and had the gifts of ancient saints and deities. Moreover, he also obtained the little guy\u2019s Supreme Being Bone. If he were to mature, he would absolutely be a heavenly deity!Shi Yi was almost ten now. His name must have certainly spread within the empire already.To be faced with a \u2018little older brother\u2019 who had so many eyes on him, who was destined to reach even higher than the heavens, and who could compete with a heavenly Archaic vicious beast \u2013 True Hou, the little guy still felt quite a bit of pressure.\u201cBecome strong\u2026 my clan\u2019s inheritance is so unfortunate. The ancestral land should have been destined to pass on the most terrifying Bone Texts and precious techniques, but they all disappeared throughout the years.\u201d The chief sighed with an incomparable regret.But immediately after, his heart began to violently beat again. He felt the bone within his chest, and had difficulty calming down again.When everyone had dispersed until only chief Shi Yunfeng, the little guy and that golden Zhuyan remained, the chief became incredibly solemn and pulled the little guy under the willow tree. He said, \u201cChild, I have no way of teaching you anymore. You\u2019re a true heavenly gifted genius, however, I have a bone here. The degree of complexity of the symbols on it will make people spit out blood with a single look. I never dared to show it to you in fear that you might suffer some serious injury, but now that I have absolutely nothing left to teach you, only this remain. If you want to see it, you must be careful!\u201dThe chief was very cautious and prudent. He took out a lustering and sparkling bone from within his chest. It seemed to be a beautiful piece of palm-sized jade that was unspeakable dazzling and pure white.Although it was big, there were an unknown number of tiny symbols etched densely upon it with absolutely no space in between. It seemed as if there were heavenly gods magically chanting, shocking to the point where one\u2019s heart and blood would churn.This was too mind-blowing. It was obviously just a piece of bone, but as soon as it was exposed, it was actually this astonishing.\u201cDon\u2019t just keep staring. After you take a look at it, look into the distance for a bit. Otherwise, you\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d The chief solemnly warned\u201cEn, grandpa chief, I know.\u201d When the little guy received it into his hands, he lightly stroked it and felt its incomparable luster and gloss. The bone was cool and refreshing, and holding it in his hands made him feel extremely comfortable.Even without being explained to in detail, this bone definitely had an astonishing origin. With a single glance, one could tell that it was extraordinary, as if the Bone Text recorded upon it described a supreme righteousness.Zhi zhi\u2026\u00a0The fist-sized golden Zhuyan jumped up and down with extreme unrest. Its pair of sharp large eyes were perfectly round as it screeched intensely, wishing that it could seize it right away. \u00a0After it saw the bone, it became extremely restless and impatient.\u201cGrandpa, how did you obtain this? This precious bone seems extraordinary.\u201d asked the little guy.\u201cOf course!\u201d When the chief mentioned this bone, his voice began to shudder. He raised his head toward the thick scorched black willow tree and his heart couldn\u2019t help but beat wildly.\u201cThis has some relationship with the Willow Deity?\u201d Little Shi Hao was surprised.The chief nodded. During that night over tens of years ago, lightning struck, thunder rumbled, heavy rain poured, and violent gales angrily cried. It was extremely violent. Many huge mountains were hacked down by lightning, and the mountains flash floods were like the seas. Beasts flooded frantically, and its terror made people shiver.The willow deity bathed in this sea of thunder. Lightning as thick as mountains lingered around it, and a myriad of willow branches formed streaks of divine chains, penetrating into the heavens. Finally, it snapped and became burnt black all over. It fell from the sky with a lump of light still lingering outside of it. It wrapped up this lustering white bone as it descended down into Stone Village together.\u201cYa!\u00a0It descended from the sky together with the Willow Deity?\u201d The little guy was astonished.\u201cRight!\u201d The chief nodded with all his might. He was still young back then as he witnessed this entire thing; one could very well imagine the trembling within his heart.For the past tens of years, Shi Yunfeng held that bone and worshiped the willow tree many times to conduct the sacrificial ceremony. However, he never obtained any responses from the willow tree, and never received any divine communications.From the chief\u2019s point of view, perhaps the Willow Deity was only interested in the little guy. It only spoke a few times, and it was related to him each time.\u201cWillow Deity, what does this mean?\u201d \u00a0This little guy opened his mouth and couldn\u2019t help but asked.The willow tree remained\u00a0silent, and it did not make a single sound. It didn\u2019t reply, and its thick and burnt trunk was like a huge black rock.Zhi zhi\u2026\u00a0The fist-sized golden Hairy Ball became to reveal its yearning more and more, as if it was trying its hardest to remember something. A pair of large sharp eyes rolled and swiveled. It pounced towards the sparkling white bone and wanted to embrace it in its bosom.Without knowing how much time had passed, the willow tree sounded out again by speaking only four words, \u201cThe True Primordial Record.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Perfect WorldCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 \u2013 Cultivation\u201cTrue Primordial Record?\u201d The little guy was amazed, as this name sounded completely out of the ordinary. In the past, it was wrapped in light as it fell together with the Willow Deity, so its origins must have been heaven shocking.The fist-sized Hairy Ball was squeaking non-stop, grabbing its ears and scratching its cheeks. It pounced into the little guy\u2019s hands liked a little golden koala and embraced the sparkling white bone. No matter what anyone said, it wouldn\u2019t let go. Its actions suggested that this belonged to him, and that no one could take it away from him!\u201cPlease advise me Willow Deity, how does one cultivate the True Primordial Record?\u201d asked the chief in the little guy\u2019s place, since this related to his future.\u201cTo comprehend the True Primordial Record\u00a0requires the most solid foundation. From a young age within the Blood Transforming Realm, you must be like the child of a heaven rank Archaic Vicious Beast. Your flesh alone must be able to lift a hundred thousand jin of divine metal, and attain a willpower that is even tougher than steel; only after possessing these strengths would you then be able to!\u201d replied the willow tree, and its words made the chief\u2019s heart shudder.This was just too difficult, how could a child accomplish this? Even an adult expert couldn\u2019t do this. Without the activation of the Bone Text\u2019s powers, how many people\u2019s flesh could be that powerful?\u201cI will do my best, and accomplish this in the shortest time possible.\u201d The little guy conscientiously nodded and emitted a determined gaze.From that day forth, Shi Hao began his bitter cultivation, and would sometimes obtain suggestions from the willow tree. He earnestly refined his flesh and strengthened his bones.Honglonglong!The earth trembled. Smoke and dust filled the air.\u201cHoly shit! What is the little guy doing? He lifted the huge Dragon Horned Elephant and ran out from within the mountains?!\u201dEarly morning, a group of child were dumbstruck. If they didn\u2019t pay close attention, they might have though a huge beast was charging towards Stone Village. After they looked carefully, however, they found that it was lifted off the ground and was endlessly struggling.Underneath the Dragon Horned Elephant, there was a little fellow. He raised the huge body of the Dragon Horned Elephant with its four feet facing towards the sky as he rushed towards Stone Village, and each step he took greatly trembled the earth.A Dragon Horned Elephant was extremely huge. Every one of them weighed over several tens of thousands jin. Its entire body was covered in dense scales, and with a pair of huge dragon horns on its head, it was incredibly vicious.However right now, the little guy made one of them yield and carried it back just like this. He swiftly ran over and made a group of precious birds and weird beasts who were drinking by the beautiful lake extremely shocked. They raised their head and gazed incomprehensibly.The children were all practicing by the shore of the clear, dark blue lake, but they all stopped down. They were shocked yet excited since this was too astonishing. This wasn\u2019t something that was dragged back after killing, but a still alive Dragon Horned Elephant that weighed over several tens of thousands of jin. Carrying it while running back really made everyone speechless.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the little guy threw the Dragon Horned Elephant at the village entrance. A group of able-bodied men who heard the news immediately came out and took care of this huge prey on the spot.Zhi Zhi!!\u00a0\u00a0Hairy Ball leapt from the little guy\u2019s shoulders and landed on the elephant\u2019s head while screeching continuously, as if it was declaring that this prey belonged to it.\u201cLittle guy, your strength is too scary!\u201d A group of children surrounded him. They lively discussing with yearning and excitement as their emotions were revealed with every word.\u201cRegular practice is enough.\u201d The little guy bashfully shook his head. Since he was carrying such a heavy prey on his back while running, he was panting mildly. His little face was rosy all over like a big apple.\u201cChild, so courageous. Right now, you\u2019re the number one hunter in our village,\u00a0haha\u2026\u201d A bunch of adults all laughed and patted him on the shoulders.The second day, the ground trembled and the mountains swayed. The little guy ran over again while carrying another huge Dragon Horned Elephant. The several tens of thousands jin weight trembled the earth time and time again.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound, he threw the beast in front of the village entrance, causing the chickens to fly and dogs to jump again. All the children who were practicing by the lake were shocked, and quickly ran into the vicinity. They watched as the adults began to do their thing again.The third day, the fourth day\u2026When the little guy carried back another Dragon Horned Elephant half a month later, the children weren\u2019t even distracted anymore. The adults were also extremely unperturbed, and everyone went about their own business. Only the two uncles who were responsible for the prey immediately cleaned it up.Everyone was used to it by now since this had been going on for two months. They quickly got over their initial shock and numbness.\u201cLittle guy, too much meat. We can\u2019t finish this at all. We\u2019ve also been eating Dragon Horned Elephants every day and we\u2019re sick of it,\u201d complained a group of children.The two who were currently cleaning up the prey calmly raised their heads and concisely said, \u201cIndeed.\u201dZhi Zhi\u2026Hair ball protested, only it wasn\u2019t sick of it. For the past half month, it\u2019s been eating a large portion of the Dragon Horned Elephants every day. The quantity of food it consumed almost scared people to death. It was clearly only the size of a fist, but its appetite seemed like a bottomless pit. It could chew through a mountain of cooked meat clean.\u201cNo problem, give all the leftovers to hairy ball. From tomorrow onward, I\u2019ll switch to another fierce beast. Always catching Dragon Horned Elephants isn\u2019t good either, they\u2019ll run out.\u201d The little guy embarrassingly scratched his head.During the following two months, the little guy would capture a completely different huge beast every day. They were all tens of thousands of jin in weight, and were shockingly huge.During this period of time, the chief would also personally take on the task of boiling a special cauldron of meat soup for him daily. The soup would be made of things such as the dragon tendon snakes which could strengthen bones and nourish flesh, and he also supplemented it with all kinds of old medicines that caused his strength to increase dramatically.Stone Village was right next to a lake, and within the clear and dark blue waters, there were many Dragon Whiskered Fish. These were rare creatures that could strengthen power, and the villagers would practically dive into the lake every day to catch several of these big and spiritual fish. Their scales flickering with golden light, and their sparkling dragon whiskers alone weighed over ten jin. The value of their blood essence was high, and they were deemed an extravagant commodity even by large clans.These naturally fell into the stomachs of the children, and their strength increased rapidly.This was especially true for the little guy, since his physique was out of the ordinary. The villagers gave special treatment to him alone, and his strength could practically be said to be exploding. The ancient methods that the village had recorded down were all used on him.One must know, these ancient methods weren\u2019t ordinary. They didn\u2019t understand it in the past, but the clan members now knew. They were extremely glorious in the past, and even deities had walked out of here. These ancient methods were the accumulation of countless years of experience, so how could they possibly be ordinary things?The fortunate things was, the Willow Deity found them this precious land. Not only had their predicament with a lack of food been settled, they could find all kinds of spiritual creatures. The materials listed in those ancient methods were practically all found, and the meat soups and refined medicines created from those materials all had powerful effects.After three months, the little guy could lift something that weighed 50000 jin without using the Bone Text. Purely by relying on the power of his flesh, his divine strength was shocking since he was barely over six years old.\u201cThere\u2019s an area with a stony waterfall 70 li away. You can go over there to cultivate. Additionally, I have an ancient method here that\u2019s used to establish the fundamentals for the child of a heaven rank Archaic vicious beast.\u201d The willow tree passed on its voice as it informed the little guy of an ancient method.Little Shi Hao was immediately stunned. The Archaic vicious beasts\u2019 prescriptions for old medicine were too shocking. Perhaps even extremely large tribes with populations of tens of millions to hundreds of millions wouldn\u2019t be able to take them out.Forget about the rare and precious medicine, even the blood essences or the precious bones of the descendants were hard to obtain. This was all unexpectedly a necessity that needed to be used daily. How could Stone Village obtain all of this? These things were excessively astonishing and mind-blowing.Why were archaic vicious beasts powerful? How could they be so heaven-opposing even as youths, far exceeding the ordinary? They were completely indistinguishable from the things straight out of legends!\u201cWillow Deity. These things, we can\u2019t find them.\u201d The little guy lightly said and lowered his head.\u201cNo matter, apart from the master medicine, you can use ordinary things as substitutes.\u201d The Willow Deity passed on its voice.\u201cThat master medicine\u2026\u201d The little guy widened his eyes and understood the willow tree\u2019s meaning.\u201cThis Zhuyan that you raised, you can\u2019t let it freeload forever. Let it offer a drop of blood every few days as a replacement for that master medicine.\u201d The Willow Deity said.Ao\u2026\u00a0The golden fist sized Zhuyan\u2019s hair stood erect all over. It had unexpectedly stopped screeching, and emitted a roar. Its large eyes stared like balls as it angrily stared at the willow tree.\u201cHairy ball, I\u2019ll bring you to ancient divine mountains to eat precious medicine. Right now you have to help me first\u2026\u201d The little guy grabbed it and shook it with all his strength.Zhi Zhi\u2026\u00a0the golden Hairy Ball let out its miserable shrieks. It was a hundred and twenty percent unhappy.Over ten li away, the rocky mountains stood side by side. Violent waterfalls suspended from them. Perhaps they couldn\u2019t even be called waterfalls anymore, but mountain torrents instead. Their rumbling practically deafened the people\u2019s ears.Three large rivers converged and rushed out from within the stony mountain. Below it was a valley, and a boundless cliff formed here. The power of water was frantic as if they descended from heaven. That area of the waterfall had rubble unceasingly tumbling down.After arriving here, forget about climbing against the water flow, even approaching it would make people panic stricken. That boundless mountain torrent was too terrifying, and the huge boulders that fell as a result of the waterfall weighed thousands to tens of thousands of jin. After building power from traveling down the waterfall from such height, how fearsome was the force behind them? It was simply soul-crushing.This was precisely the little guy\u2019s new cultivation location. He had to go against the flow of the mountain torrent, and push against the huge tumbling boulders to climb up the cliff. It was obviously excessively dangerous.Hong!When he just entered the waterfall, he was thrown away by the white waves. The waterfall descended from mountain cliffs that were hundreds and thousands of meters above him, and it carried with it a ferocious power.The little guy wasn\u2019t discourage and stood up again. With a pair of hands like iron pincers, he grabbed the rocks, stopped his breathing, and climbed upwards one step at a time with extreme difficulty.That white wave flooded over him, and there was a visible convex point within the white waves on the cliff. Due to the force of the water being too ferocious and strong, ordinary strength couldn\u2019t resist it at all.Dong!A rock weighing over a thousand jin smashed into the little guy; its speed and ferocity was heart trembling.Although he was submerged in a white wave, he still reacted and rapidly dodged to one side. Although he avoided the bombardment of this huge rock, his own body staggered, and with a rumble, he dropped down along with the might of the water.This was just the beginning. The final cultivation required going against the boundless waves as well as the huge boulders that weighed over ten thousand jin. Going against the mountain torrents to climb this broken rampart was destined to be a difficult and terrifying cultivation method.When the sun was about to drop below\u00a0the horizon, the little guy returned to the village bruised and battered. No matter how powerful his flesh was, it was ineffective against that terrifying rocky waterfall.His body had patches of green and purple all over his bruises, and those who saw him like this felt their hearts ache. During the past cultivation processes, he was never injured. When the villagers saw this, they were opposed tp him undergoing such a dangerous trial by fire.They had gone to the site before. That terrifying scene was more dangerous than a battle between an army of thousands. How could the strength of a huge rock that dropped down from that height be just ten thousand jin? If one actually got hit, they would instantly turn into meat pulp.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I will try my best. I must attain the power of a heaven rank Archaic vicious beasts as soon as possible.\u201d The little guy blinked his large eyes with an unwavering gaze.Underneath the black cauldron passed on by their ancestors, flames burnt vigorously. The cauldron was boiling with all sorts of ingredients. Old medicine, dragon tendon snakes, golden centipedes, and dragon whiskered fish had been cooked into a soup a long time ago, and it emitted a special fragrance.\u201cOnly that master medicine is left,\u201d said the chief as he looked at that golden fist-sized Zhuyan.Hairy Ball\u2019s fur emitted light all over and its large eyes rolled and swiveled. It wanted to escape, but it was grabbed by the little guy who had been prepared a long time ago. He lightly said, \u201cHairy Ball, can you help me please?\u201dThe golden Hairy Ball suddenly let out a miserable shriek and began to twist in every way possible. Finally it used one of its paws to cover its own eyes and fiercely bit into the meaty pad of the other paw.Everyone started laughing. Hairy Ball seemed like it was killing chickens and slaughtering ducks. It cried non-stop as it covered its own eyes, and unwillingly allowed a drop of golden blood to drip into the cauldron.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound, the black cauldron began to emit light. The boiling cauldron began to emit rumbling noises as the chanting of deities began to spread outwards, and the even louder noises of sacrificial ceremony began to sound. This stunned the villagers, and they couldn\u2019t help but feel dumbstruck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The mountain peaks were lofty and majestic, the sun and moon rotated about, and the ancient natives sacrificed to the heavens; their grand voices were divine and solemn.It was as if they returned back to the ancient eras, and they could hear the chants of various gods.On top of the cauldron, hornless dragons, Pi Xiu, and other Archaic vicious beasts with fearsome auras came to life. They looked like they were trying to break out of the cauldron walls, and it made people\u2019s souls throb.This was truly shocking! It was as if the cauldron had a soul!\u201cThis is\u2026 a supreme treasure!\u201d The chief\u2019s voice shuddered. It turn out the medicinal cauldron they inherited from their ancestors was this unusual.Sparkling liquid appeared on the inner walls of the cauldron like drops of sweet nectar. Although there weren\u2019t that many drops, the fragrance they emitted made their bodies stretch comfortably and their pores unfold.Using the Zhuyan\u2019s golden blood as the master medicine, the results were extremely shocking, as it was actually able to restore the power of the cauldron they inherited from their ancestors. The appearance of this strange scene made everyone flabbergasted.The chief had previously heard some insider information and legends, and so he said, \u201cThis cauldron is unspeakably precious. As it refines the rare and precious medicine over the years, the medicinal properties will be absorbed into the cauldron walls. The golden Zhuyan blood that was used today was what made the cauldron resonate.\u201dThe contents of the cauldron boiled, and the golden medicinal liquid was incredibly fragrant. Together with the sounds of the sacrificial ceremony and the divine chants, it made the atmosphere feel extremely mysterious. It was as if a furnace of divine medicine was being created.\u201cGood, good, good!\u201d The bodies of the group of elders were all shivering. They extended their folded and elderly hands, and wanted to caress the cauldron; this cauldron was unexpectedly so mystical.On the cauldron walls, those dew drops tumbled down and blended with the boiling medicinal liquid, making the fragrance even richer. The villagers opened their eyes wide and carefully watched.\u201cThis \u2018medicinal base\u2019 is warming up this entire furnace of medicinal liquid!\u201dThis cauldron had refined many precious medicine in the past, and ample medicinal properties have nourished and blended into the cauldron. The drops of liquid that appeared on the cauldron walls were the \u2018medicinal base\u2019 that had been deposited over the years, and they could improve the quality of medicinal liquid that\u2019s being refined right now.A cauldron that is able to produce \u201cmedicinal base\u201d is an incredible and priceless treasure. Once it reaches this level, it could communicate with the spirits and could extract the divine essence between heaven and earth by itself, absorbing them into the cauldron walls. This medicinal base is created through the fusion of the deposited medicinal properties together with the divine essence of heaven and earth, and it was extremely powerful.Sure enough, after the medicinal base slide inside, the dim golden liquid became even more fragrant, making this cauldron of medicinal liquid sparkle all over. Smelling a breath of this freshened the soul, relieving and relaxing the bones.\u201cThis is already considered a furnace of precious medicine!\u201d Shi Linghu was shocked and practically couldn\u2019t believe that a village like this could refine such a high level of medicinal liquid.The group of children couldn\u2019t help but salivate. The medicinal juice was too fragrant, and they wanted to drink a mouthful of it right away. Right now, they felt as if their tongues were melting within the liquid.Zhi Zhi\u2026Hairy Ball became agitated as well. It scuttled and jumped all over while almost falling into the cauldron, but was quickly caught by the little guy.\u201cAlthough we\u2019re just a village without any Archaic Descendant blood, precious bones, or rare spirit medicine, we can rely on this cauldron and the Zhuyan\u2019s golden blood to refine some pretty good doses of medicine.\u201d Shi Feijiao clenched his fists in excitement.The little guy didn\u2019t conceal anything from the villagers and had told them his past long ago. It made every one of them sob, and they all cheered him on, hoping that he could rise up quickly within these desolate lands.Shi Yi who had the potential to be like an ancient saint, who had the aptitude of gods, who even obtained a Supreme Being Bone, was destined to far surpass any ordinary genius. He was born within an ancient country, and was raised by the power of the clan. He would eventually become extremely terrifying.Even the villagers knew that with such a heavenly gifted opponent, it would make anyone feel uneasy. They naturally wished for the little guy to charge into the heavens as soon as possible.\u201cThat little brat Shi Yi was born in a noble family and could use its endless resources. He wouldn\u2019t lack the blood of Archaic Descendants, nor would he have a lack for any rare spirit medicines. After maturing like this, he would definitely be extremely terrifying.Right now, Shi Yi\u00a0was already nine and was almost ten. Even without thinking, everyone knew that he was destined to become like a splendid divine sun that hung over the sky of the ancient country, and the dazzling rays of light from the tens of thousands of gazes would rest on him.Shi Linghu groaned and said, \u201cOur Stone Village isn\u2019t lacking either. We have this cauldron here that can refine precious medicine not inferior to anything, and so we definitely won\u2019t fall too far behind.\u201d\u201cNot bad, that glorious ancient country originated from Stone Village, and they eventually moved away. Now, we are starting over, and we can see whether their family\u2019s genius is more powerful or the people of the ancestral lands are more powerful.\u201d Several clan elders seemed like little old kids and didn\u2019t want to concede defeat. They told the villagers to search all over for ancient objects left behind by their ancestors, and to check to see whether or not they could find something extraordinary.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the medicine cauldron trembled and gushed out a multicolored light. The Zhuyan\u2019s blood dyed the cauldron walls in a dim gold, and the medicinal liquid violently boiled.Steam began to rise all over this place, and rainbow lights flowed all over. They looked dazzling and beautiful, and their fragrances penetrated into the people\u2019s souls, making them feel as if they were levitating.\u201cSo sweet!\u201d Everyone swallowed their saliva and waited patiently. The group of children were sniffing their noses non-stop.The cauldron walls were brilliant, and the incredibly loud sounds of first natives\u2019 sacrificial ceremonies sounded again. Archaic vicious birds and fierce beasts were tyrannical and fierce, and vaguely visible gods sprinkled their glory. It was incredibly mysterious.The medicinal cauldron shook, and the flames beneath it went out by itself. The dim golden medicinal liquid was complete!Zhi Zhi\u2026\u00a0The little guy hadn\u2019t even moved yet and the golden Zhuyan couldn\u2019t hold itself back any longer and was prepared to be the first one. It wanted to sample it.\u201cHairy Ball, this master medicine is refined using your own blood as the master medicine, do you actually want to drink your own blood?\u201d Er Meng asked.This made Hairy Ball feel embarrassed. It grabbed its ears and scratched its head, but it couldn\u2019t stop the the enticement of the medicine fragrance. It stole a porcelain bowl from the hands of a villager and directly scooped out a bit before beginning to drink..\u201cIt even drinks its own blood?\u201dZhi Zhi..\u00a0Hairy Ball cried out non-stop. It was implying that this wasn\u2019t a big deal, and that it was satisfied.After that, the little guy drank a bowl of this golden medicinal liquid, and he suddenly felt a flame escaping from inside his body. His entire body shined and following that, he immediately broke out into a huge sweat. In the blink of an eye, he seemed like he was scooped out from water. Steam began to evaporate from atop his body, and multicolored light overflowed in every direction. His skin became sparkling and translucent, and his bones were creaking non-stop.The strength of the medicine was too great, and it made him clearly feel right away that his four limbs and hundred bones were being hammered and refined. The blood clots all over his body faded, and the green and purple patches rapidly healed. The bones inside his body were also shining.Strands of light were emitted, forming into a lump of misty light and submerging the little guy within. Only after a long while did it dissipate.\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d The group of villagers anxiously gazed.\u201cThe results are surprisingly good,\u201d the little guy said.The chief scooped out another bowl and handed it over to the little guy for him to drink. To refine and hammer the body, it was necessary to take care of the body well; otherwise, it will give root to future troubles.Evidently, this cauldron of medicine liquid couldn\u2019t be finished by the little guy himself. The group of children lifted their little bowls and all received some, and it rapidly entered into their mouths. Only, their flesh had a huge disparity compared to the little guy\u2019s. After drinking a mouthful, their noses and mouths began to spout out the multicolored light like a fire.Aooo\u2026This group of children was scuttling and hopping before all rushing into the lake. After making\u00a0pu pu pu\u00a0sounds, they suddenly all ran into the water. Otherwise, their bodies would have continuously felt that burning heat, as if they were being cooked alive.None of them could calm down during the entire night. After drinking just a little bowl, they all decided to soak in the lake until sunrise.A cauldron of medicinal liquid was boiled into a thick juice. A large portion of it entered the little guy\u2019s stomach, and the rest was divided amongst the children and the adults. Naturally, they wouldn\u2019t leave out the three young birds either. Everyone\u2019s bodies were incredibly hot and dry, and it became a sleepless night.The little guy on the other hand slept very soundly. His inner organs were sparkling and translucent, and his bones were white all over as if they had been washed. When the dawn arrived, he discovered that all the residue within him had been expelled, and a layer of stickiness covered his body.He picked up a set of clean clothes and placed them by the lake side. He jumped into the lake with a\u00a0pu\u00a0sound, he suddenly scared a group of children whose eyes were as red as rabbits.\u201cYou guys are so early.\u201d The little guy greeted.\u201cWuwu\u2026\u00a0we haven\u2019t slept yet.\u201d cried out the group of children. However, they weren\u2019t fatigued at all and were exuberant with energy instead; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have soaked here for so long.\u201cOh, you guys continue then. I\u2019m going to go train.\u201d A new day had started, and after the little guy had his breakfast, he sprinted towards the rocky waterfall.Day after day passed by, and the little guy left early and returned late each day.The waterfall was like a river of stars. It was deafening, and rocks dropped from atop the mountain. The little guy stared at the waterfall\u2019s vast expanse of whiteness, and tried to climb up with great difficulty.Boom!When the several hundred jin of rubble fell down again, he no longer dodged and endured the collision head on. He held firmly on the cliff and scaled upwards. In a short three months, he trained his body to be as hard as metal.Hong!Suddenly, a several thousand jin boulder fell down from above. Although it didn\u2019t fall down from the highest point, with the rushing of the waterfall, its power was shocking. It was obviously only a few thousand jin, but the collision would have behind it a force of at least several dozen thousand jin.The little guy was submerged within the white waterfall and he was currently grabbing\u00a0onto\u00a0a white protrusion on\u00a0the cliff. However, his perception was incredibly powerful and felt the incoming danger. This time, he decided not to avoid it and used his body to resist it instead.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound,\u00a0the huge boulder descended and collided into his back, causing a dull noise. White billows rushed into the sky, enshrouding this entire area.The little guy didn\u2019t use the Bone Text, but his flesh was already sparkling and translucent. It emitted a hazy radiance of light that hardened his entire body. He succeeded!His body violently shook, and the shroud of light withdrew. Although his back was in serious pain, his muscles and bones weren\u2019t injured. He astonishingly resisted the entire force.This was only the fruit of several months of labor. He bitterly trained\u00a0each day, and ground\u00a0his body to the point that there was be a layer of precious light enveloping his body even without activating the bone text. This was purely the power of the blood essence, which automatically protected his body.\u201cIs this the true meaning behind the Blood Transformation boundary that the Willow Deity mentioned?\u201d the little guy said to himself.What the willow tree said had the same name as what was happening now, but the cultivation results were completely different, as it used Archaic vicious beasts as a standard for comparison.Just like this, day after day and month after month, the little guy left early and returned late. He would become riddled with scars every day, but with the willow tree\u2019s ancient methods, precious medicine would often be refined. He would instantly recover using the dim golden liquid.He was still as pretty and delicate as before. His little face was tender white and his big eyes were very spirited, but his flesh had clearly improved in strength. When he received an attack, his blood essence would surge, and it was as if his body was filled with the power of the Big Dipper, making his body sparkle. If an ordinary boulder smashed into his body, it would immediately split open, and wouldn\u2019t harm even a fraction of his body.In the blink of an eye, he had been cultivating for almost a year, and the little guy was almost seven years old.Early in the morning, at the rumbling\u00a0waterfall, the little guy carried a thousand jin boulder and scaled up the vast waterfall against the descending boulders. He only used a single arm and two legs.Boom!Stones tumbled down and struck him, but it couldn\u2019t stop him at all. His entire body was steady like a divine ape. He rapidly charged up, and even the waves or boulders had difficulty shooting him down.Finally, he climbed up the rocky mountain. He stood there and his entire body shining with precious light. This past year of cultivation had caused his flesh and body to undergo a terrifying transformation.This was all achieved as early as a month ago, and recently, he had only been solidifying these results.\u201cRise!\u201dOn top of the vast waterfall, a little figure faced the morning light. He lifted up a ten thousand jin boulder, and his entire body dazzled as his flesh emitted precious light.This scene startled the nearby ferocious beasts into roaring, and the vicious birds took flight. They were all trembling in fear of this little figure.In the morning light, that little figure was completely splendid. A terrifying aura was being released, as of the child of a divine god towered over the waterfall and displayed an indescribable spirit.Only the young of an Archaic vicious beast could do this. The extreme hundred thousand jin boundary was broken through by the little guy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was an insanely hard to accomplish task, and that was why it was called an extreme boundary!During the Archaic era, heaven rank divine birds and vicious beast used this system to measure their offspring and predict their future accomplishments. Not every offspring could achieve the potential of that extreme boundary.Right now, the little guy had successfully completed it. He lifted up a hundred thousand jin boulder, and his body was shimmering in the splendor of the morning light. His actions trembled the entire desolate land, and many vicious birds and ferocious beasts anxiously escaped in fear.\u201cYa, I did it.\u201d The little guy released the boulder, and it descended alongside the waterfall. A rumbling sound shook the heavens and the earth, as if a great earthquake suddenly occurred.To have such strength at such an age while purely using the flesh, this was absolutely world shocking. This was an accomplishment that surpassed the ordinary. Under normal circumstances, this was absolutely unattainable with just the physical body.The little guy faced the light of dawn as he stood on top of a boulder. The vast and rapidly flowing white water rumbled beside him like thunder, trembling this entire rocky mountain. His body glowed with a unique luster, healthy and translucent. He seemed as if he had an endless supply of energy, and even the hundred thousand extreme boundary was broken by him, laying down an incredibly firm foundation.\u201cI can see the \u2018True Primordial Record\u2019 now, but it\u2019s better if I\u2019m a bit stronger!\u201d said the little guy to himself. He had broken through the extreme limit, but this wasn\u2019t his destination.He didn\u2019t end his training, and instead prepared to spend a little while longer, refining his flesh to an even higher level. He rigorously demanded from himself that he had to surpass his own limits!Whether it was windy or rainy, the little guy never stopped for a single day. He was already seven years old.Hong!Lightning flashed, thunder rolled, and a heavy rain flooded the entire desolate land. Although it was daytime, the sky was instead frighteningly dark. One couldn\u2019t even see their own fingers if they stretched out their arms, and the only time the earth lit up was when lightning filled the skies.In the middle of the torrential storm, a little figure was sprinting across the earth while dragging with him a hundred thousand jin boulder. He charged against the mountain torrent, and only used the strength of his body to resist this heavenly might.This wasn\u2019t a showering of rubble, but a true mountain torrent!Huge waves crashed into the sky, and mountain boulders tumbled into the flood. It wiped away everything, destroying ancient forests one after another. This was an unbelievably powerful heavenly might! In the face of nature, mankind seemed incomparably tiny and feeble.Groups of vicious beasts fled, in fear of dying alongside this collapsing country.However, the little guy wasn\u2019t afraid in the slightest, and went up against this force with the strength of his flesh. He sprinted forcefully against the mountain current, all the way into the heart of the mountains.Honglonglong!The muddy waters and vicious boulders unceasingly rushed forth from within the mountain range. This was an enormous natural disaster, however, the little guy didn\u2019t fear this at all. Sometimes, the torrents that reached into the skies would send him flying into the mountain cliffs, but he still never stopped. After regaining his footing, he would once again advance forward.Without any symbols flickering, and without any heavenly precious techniques, he only used the body that he attained after his arduous training to face this torrential storm. His body was glowing with a sparkling luster, and he did not make a single noise; he solitarily advanced forward and faced the heavenly might.When the torrential storm stopped, it was already evening. The black clouds dispersed, and huge trees within the mountains were snapped. Torrential waters flowed, boulders tumbled, and many places were turned into large ponds.The little guy was dripping wet and bruised all over, but he didn\u2019t have a single fracture nor was bleeding. It was possible to see just how powerful his body had become as he survived this ordeal.Just like this, day after day, the little guy used these various heavenly calamities to cultivate. Sometimes he jumped off of huge cliffs, and sometimes he even agitated some enormous vicious beasts in order to fight them.Each\u00a0time, he returned riddled with scars. He would consume the golden liquid in the medicine cauldron and undergo constant metamorphosis, improving his physique day by day. Some of the villagers didn\u2019t dare to believe that he could improve at such an absurd speed.When the little guy was seven and a half, he stopped. After such a long period of tampering and refining, not only was his body strength shocking, even his willpower became as strong as steel.\u201cWillow Deity, my physical body has finished the first period of cultivation.\u201d The little guy came to the village entrance and faced the scorched black willow tree.\u201cWhat kind of results have you seen?\u201d asked the willow tree.The little guy walked to the lakeside and single-handedly raised a hundred thousand jin boulder. Every creature near the lake were absolutely shocked. Regardless of whether it were the children, adults, or even the precious birds and strange beasts, they were all dumbfounded.What kind of power was this? Single-handedly raising a hundred thousand jin boulder was too astonishing; no one had heard of such a thing before.Then, he switched to his other hand and similarly raised it up again. His entire body was covered in a layer of radiance, and that radiance was automatically emitted, representing the extreme boundary!Even the willow tree was silent, and didn\u2019t speak right away.\u201cChild, put it down quick. Don\u2019t hurt yourself!\u201d shouted a few of the village\u2019s adults.Who could move that huge boulder? Ordinarily, they used it to dry the meat and beast fur. They were incredibly enormous, yet currently, they were in the hands of the little guy. They were all emotionally shocked.\u201c108000 jin of divine force with just a swing of your arm. You did very well, greatly exceeding my expectations!\u201d said the willow tree, and it appeared that it was astonished as well.Let alone human, even the strongest Golden Winged Peng or the Genuine Hou youths could only achieve this result. It was incredibly difficult to become this powerful, and this was truly emotionally touching.Divine strength was not mankind\u2019s strong point, yet the little guy managed to reach the pinnacle of this aspect, shocking even the willow tree.This little fellow\u2019s potential was truly great, even greater than it imagined!\u201cLittle guy, how did you accomplish this?\u201d A group of children rushed forth and pinched his little arm. They all felt that this was simply inconceivable.\u201cThat thing is practically a rock mountain. Little guy, you\u2019re truly not bad, actually lift it up with one hand. This kind of strength would shock even the Archaic descendants within the mountains. Their children are far from capable of achieving this.\u201dThe group of children were shocked and excited. They surrounded the little guy and chattered about many things.The group of adults were dumbfounded as well, because it was truly ridiculous that a child could be this powerful and dauntless.\u201cLittle guy, uncle\u2019s request isn\u2019t much. In the future, give me the child of a Suan Ni for the sake of protection and gate guarding\u201d\u201cHah, this request isn\u2019t much? The first thing out of your mouth is one of the strongest vicious beasts. What else do you want? Little guy, this uncle\u2019s request is quite simple. Capture a genuine pure-blooded Pi Xiu youth in the future for me okay?\u201d\u201cGet lost, how is a Pi Xiu worse than a Suan Ni? Aren\u2019t they\u2019re both equally powerful?\u201dA group of adults were making jokes and having fun. They didn\u2019t want the little guy to forget Stone Village when he became stronger, and wanted him to capture a young genuine Archaic vicious beast to guard this place.Only after a long period of time had passed did the villagers disperse.\u201cWillow Deity, can I cultivate the \u2018True Primordial Record\u2019 now?\u201d The little guy raised his head. He was now seven years old and grew a lot taller, but he was still young and tender. There was a clear distinction between the white and black parts of his large eyes, making him seem exceptionally bright.\u201cYou can.\u201d The willow tree made an agreeable response.Not only did the little guy\u2019s flesh surpass the requirement, his willpower was also shocking. During this year and a half of bitter training, he was undaunted by setbacks. He trained under all kinds of different heavenly powers, and his willpower became as tough as steel.\u201cBut, what is the \u2018True Primordial Record\u2019 actually about?\u201d The little guy took out that lustering white bone and modestly asked for guidance. He had a hopeful radiance within his eyes.\u201cYou should finely study it yourself. A journey must be taken one step at a time. The bone is world-shaking, so you can\u2019t show this to others casually,\u201d warned the Willow Deity.\u201cEn!\u201d The little guy earnestly nodded.Since that day, it was as if the little guy met the devil. \u00a0He studied while sitting, pondering while standing, and even frowned while sleeping. He was comprehending and understanding this heavenly book whenever he could.The characters on the pure white bone were densely concentrated. They described the origins of these symbols, and explained the mysteries of this ancient precious bone. It also described the strengths and weaknesses of various Archaic Vicious Beasts and Divine Birds.This bone book originated from the ancient times, and explained the mysteries of the heaven and earth. It has survived through so much, and everything was recorded upon it. Unfortunately, there were no precious techniques on this bone.One could use it as a guide for cultivation, helping one make breakthroughs. It could certainly be called a priceless heavenly book, and would become a treasure within any clan, only that it lacked an unrivaled precious technique.The little guy became silly, and spat blood several times when reading it. He was much stronger than the chief, but he was injured several times as the things recorded on this bone book were too terrifying.For the sake of explaining the symbols from the ancient past, it contained examples of battles. A picture of a battle between a Clear-Sky Peng and a God was distinctly visible, creating a bitter and omnipresent aura. He almost wanted to spit out blood, as this was like stepping into the ancient past to genuinely re-envision that battle.This was merely a picture, and there was a lot of other information on the topic of symbols that did not involve precious techniques. At least ten different scenes of actual battles were miniaturized onto this pure white bone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It contained endless mysteries as well, and upon it were engraved pictures of confrontations between Archaic Vicious Beasts and Gods. Everything began from the most primitive origins.The little guy had a silly look on his face, and he was incomparably fascinated. As he embraced the sparkling piece of bone, he was constantly pondering and comprehending it, almost as if he was bewitched by a devil. It was to the point that one time, he accidentally walked straight into the lake. Only when the waters reached his nose and mouth did he snap back to reality, and all the villagers didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cI put a bowl of\u00a0beast milk in front of his eyes and he actually didn\u2019t see it. This isn\u2019t normal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over. Little guy\u2019s gone silly. Will he become stupid?\u201dThe group of children were muttering amongst themselves. Seeing him act like that, they all felt as if he had been bewitched by the devil.\u201cDon\u2019t work your brain too much and be careful of injuries,\u201d the village chief solemnly warned. This wasn\u2019t the first time the little guy had spat out blood, so even if his flesh was powerful, he still needed to pay attention.The little guy was so completely into it that he neglected sleep and food. The shining bone never left his hand as he continuously turned, studied, and tried to comprehend it. He forgot about everything else, and was completely immersed in his studying.He saw another example of a battle, a Golden Winged Peng against a Deity. The symbols on the bone were dense, and the engraved picture was very small, but it was very genuine; the passion seeped out of the bone!The little guy became increasingly concentrated and never blinked. The divine essence was incredibly condensed, and he was practically drowning into the bone. Being so engrossed like this, even the engraved pictures looked different.That Golden Winged Peng emitted a faint golden luster, and gradually, its entire body became bright and resplendent. It became extremely prominent on the bone fragment, and it was as if it was casted out of golden metal. Vivid and lifelike, it seemed as if it was going to fly out of the picture!An incredibly decisive and violent battle was taking place between the Golden Winged Peng and the Deity. The two sides were both injured, and it was dyed in both the God\u2019s blood as well as its own golden blood essence. It was the lord over heaven and earth, and its huge golden wings practically covered the entire dome of heaven; its power was unrivaled.It hadn\u2019t recorded any heaven shocking precious techniques, and instead, it only elaborated on the ancient and unique usages of symbols. This object drew out several crucial points of the battle, and it truly contained boundless mysterious meanings.After looking at only a single picture, the little guy was already bewitched. He was so engrossed in it that he completely blocked out everything else. Only when his energy had been completely emptied and when he spat out a few mouthful of blood did he slowly start to open his eyes.When the villagers saw this scene, they couldn\u2019t help but feel their hearts ache. The little guy was so engrossed and obsessed that he might eventually run into some big problems. They all advised against acting like this.\u201cEn, I know. These engraved pictures are too profound, and it\u2019s not an area that I can comprehend yet. It\u2019ll be fine if I take things slowly.\u201d The little guy listened and obeyed the advice and carefully came to this conclusion.If these fight diagrams and engraved pictures were leaked to the outside world, it would certainly arouse a huge ruckus. Although there weren\u2019t any precious techniques on it, it could definitely be called a \u2018divine battle record\u2019.A Golden Winged Peng in a confrontation with God, how many people could actually see a scene like this? If a picture like this was exposed, it would certainly shock the world. It was a treasure that experts dreamt about. It wasn\u2019t just true for humans, this was something every race wanted to obtain!This was where the \u2018True Primordial Record\u2019 was scary. When it explained symbols and mysterious meanings, it explained through examples of battles both shallow and deep, from deep to shallow; it touched upon a heaven and earth that was impossible to see.A small boat floated on top of a lake and the clear lake water rippled with the wind. Golden Dragon Whiskered Fish glittering with brilliant splendor leapt out, creating large water blossoms.The little guy laid on the small boat calmly and peacefully. His entire body was shining, and strands of divine light flickered. He reconstructed the symbols within his body again to fuse with his flesh.Once he finished reading the True Primordial Record, his comprehension considerably deepened and far surpassed his knowledge from before. He understood the most fundamental meaning of symbols, and began to practice Blood Transformation again. One speck of light appeared after another like the magic of Gods, and permanently integrated into his body. They chanted scriptures, protected his body, nourished his spirit, shed his mortal body and continuously strengthening him.The results were shocking. The little guy looked like a furnace and shined for days on end. His internal appeared external as strands of sparkling and brilliant mysterious patterns appeared on his body one after another.The villagers didn\u2019t bother him and allowed him to comprehend and cultivate. The little guy was half awake, and he focused all of his mind into it as he roamed within that beautiful world.Divine light was brimming outside his body like divine wings. The blood essence within his body rumbled, and every drop of blood contained a symbol. As they condensed together, their auras became increasingly rich and powerful.The divine light outside his body was sparkling and holy. He looked like he would grow wings and fly away. His body scattered a rain of light, illuminating the surface of the lake.The villagers were all startled as they surrounded and watched from the lake shore. Even those precious birds and strange beast such as the little Luans or the Unicorns were dumbfounded as they looked towards the middle of the lake in a daze. Groups of Dragon Whiskered Fish all swam close and bathed in the shower of light. They used their dense golden scales to reflect the light at each other.The little guy shut his eyes. The light on his body constantly circulated, and the shower of light swirled about as he underwent constant transformations.The spirit essence between heaven and earth rushed into his body and nourished his inner organs, making him look sparkling and translucent all over. His blood essence was like a long river, constantly rumbling and turned as if they were turning into celestial bodies.With his previous test completed, he started cultivating anew. The Blood Transformation was perfect, and he had reached an extraordinary state.The little guy opened his eyes, and the divine light was retracted into himself. His body was translucent like a tender jade sculpted to perfection. The large golden fish within the lake were all startled and rapidly moved their tails as they wanted to submerge into the lake bottom.Putong.The little guy jumped into the water and caught a Dragon Whiskered Fish that weighed up to three hundred jin. Golden light swirled all around its body, and its whiskers were sparkling and fragrant. Every part of its body was a treasure.\u201cNasally kid, catch.\u201d The little guy yelled as he raised his arm and threw it onto the shore.Then, he entered the water again to rapid chase and catch another huge 200 jin golden fish that emitted a sweet scent, directly tossing it onto the shore.\u201cWow, it\u2019s a fish king. Several tens of jins were already considered big before. I never thought that this kind of precious fish could grow this big!\u201d\u201cLittle guy, there are many large fish. I just saw over twenty that were at least this big. Catch them quickly!\u201dThe group of children shouted and cried. Fish kings like these definitely had extremely good medicinal properties. Once they were eaten, it could significantly increase their blood aura and strengthen them considerably.The little guy didn\u2019t continue catching them at all, but leapt to the shore instead. It wasn\u2019t easy for the dark blue lake to give birth to such precious fish. He shouldn\u2019t catch all the fish king since they had to lay their eggs first.\u201cGrandpa, I want to take a long journey away from home.\u201d After the little guy finished dinner, he suddenly spoke these words.The chief\u2019s rough hands trembled and raised his head before asking, \u201cChild, you\u2019re so young. Your cultivation still hasn\u2019t truly reached the point where you can go wherever you wish in these desolate lands. Where do you want to go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t truly want to leave Stone Village, and I only want to finish the self-improvement process explained by Willow Deity. I want to travel around and quickly return,\u201d the little guy gently said.Although he was leaving for self-improvement, the location was still up to him to decide.His eyes were filled with mist as he recalled his missing his parents and relatives. It\u2019s been over a year since they departed, but Shi Ziling unexpectedly never returned; he was incredibly worried.\u201cChild, you\u2019re not going to go to the ancient country right?\u201d The chief was concerned, since how could a little child like him go alone into such a powerful kingdom. It was truly too unrealistic.The little guy shook his head and said, \u201cI won\u2019t take any risks. I\u2019m only going near the great desolate area\u2019s borders. Willow Deity told me to fight with ferocious beasts of the desolate wastelands, and sharpen and improve under dangerous situations. Only like that could I solidify my comprehension and quickly mature.\u201dRight now he had already re-cultivated the Blood Transformation realm into perfection. He followed the Willow Deity\u2019s warning and didn\u2019t rush his breakthrough. He paused his cultivation in this realm for another month in order to experience more, and comprehending more would benefit his future cultivation.The little guy wanted to go take a look at the second ancestral land. There were a few accomplished elders in the banished land, and they once chatted very agreeably with his parents. They should know where his parents went in the end.The child had been away from his parents for many years. When he found out that they were searching for a holy medicine for his sake, and even braved death to enter an ancient divine mountain, it was easy to imagine how much longing and worry was in his heart.Perhaps he couldn\u2019t do anything, but he wanted to hear about their whereabouts. He was brimming with emotions, and he longed for his relatives. Even if he couldn\u2019t see them, obtaining even the slightest bit of information about them would be comforting.Besides, there was another child who substituted for him there and was sent to the desolate land as punishment. He didn\u2019t know whether the child lived his life comfortably or in danger. The little guy was a rather emotional person, and felt that a child shouldn\u2019t have deserved such a fate.\u201cChild, it\u2019s too far. This journey is too dangerous!\u201d The chief didn\u2019t agree.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s far, this path really isn\u2019t impossible to overcome. Through my unconscious memory, Willow Deity once estimated that there was a distance of 300,000 li between here and there,\u201d the little guy said.The second ancestral land was located in the ancient country\u2019s borders, and it was savage and cold. Its distance from the ancestral land was truly not too far, only 300,000 li. Clearly, the Stone Clan\u2019s people were always searching for their roots.Over 300,000 li away compared to the ancient country\u2019s vast and boundless territory really wasn\u2019t much, but to a child like the little guy who had never journeyed far away, it was truly an astronomical number.\u201cYou never traveled so far away before. How can I feel at ease?\u201d The chief didn\u2019t agree.After a short while, the villagers all found out and also firmly opposed. This long and dangerous road was fraught with dangers. A single accident would spell certain death within the mountain ranges.\u201cWillow Deity said that this was a very important part of training, and demanded me to take this journey,\u201d said the little guy.When the villagers heard, they immediately became silent. The scorched black willow tree was a supreme being in their hearts. It truly would do no good to oppose its words.\u201cThis kind of training, you can refuse. You don\u2019t have to accept it. I\u2019m only training you in accordance to the methods used by the young of the Genuine Hou, Suan Ni and other Archaic Vicious beasts. 300,000 li is truly very terrifying. There are many strange species within the great desolate lands. If you suddenly meet one without prior avoidance, it would become really dangerous,\u201d Willow Deity said.During the ancient era, all kinds of supremely powerful creatures was\u00a0very harsh towards their heirs. For the sake of their maturity and becoming an unparalleled power in the future, they would often undergo hellish training.They had to travel alone within the desolate wasteland, with ferocious beasts everywhere. They had to journey through the incredibly dangerous mountain ranges, and this was an enormous trial. Although they didn\u2019t have explicit enemies, this was possibly even more dangerous.The Willow Deity\u2019s training fundamentally couldn\u2019t be measured with the average villager as the norm. Everything was done according to the world\u2019s most powerful species.\u201cI\u2019ll give it a try. If it\u2019s truly impossible, I won\u2019t take any risks and return early.\u201d The little guy\u2019s gaze was unwavering.In his subconscious memory, his grandfather once killed the young of a Pi Xiu with extremely pure blood in the Hundred Clan Battlefield. Thinking back, it was definitely because the supremely powerful vicious beast deliberated released its heir inside to conduct cruel training.\u201cI can do it too!\u201d The little guy clenched his fists and encouraged himself as he wished to journey in the direction of the ancient country.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A string of red light appeared on the mountain top and the sun struggled to seep out. It sprinkled its warm and comforting radiance, dying the fog in light gold and circulating multicolored light.The people of Stone Village had woken up a long time ago, and a group of children faced the morning light while training. They puffed out their essence energy and each of seemed as strong as a Pi Xiu youth.The little guy sat on the side as he watched them. On the verge of leaving for a long journey, he was reluctant to go. Zi Yun, Da Peng, and Xiao Qing snuggled against his side. They were very unwilling to let him go and wanted to follow him, but he didn\u2019t agree.This entire journey was very dangerous. Taking him 300,000 li away, this long of a journey would pass through a great number of mountain ranges, and was filled with all types of dangers. After entering the lofty mountains, there would often be enormous figures streaking past the sky. All kinds of uncommon yet terrifying vicious birds passed by.When the little guy went to cultivate, he personally saw a huge bird over 50 meters long streaking across the sky while spitting out flames, directly melting a mountain top into magma. Another time, he even saw a ferocious bird over 100 meters long entering the clouds to catch a Flood Dragon. He tore it into two pieces to devour it within its stomach, and blood sprinkled down onto the mountain like specks of rain.Although Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing weren\u2019t ordinary and they could fly across the sky as well as hide on the ground, after all, they were still immature. If they were used as transportation in this long and endless journey, it would truly be too dangerous.Only heaven knew what kind of fierce birds would suddenly charge out from a mountain range and rip them apart while they were still maturing.Fierce birds could spread their wings to approach the clouds and soar between the heaven and earth. They possess extreme speed, but they were excessively eye-catching and might end up become an airborne tyrant\u2019s hunting targeting. It was possibly even more dangerous than passing through the forest.\u201cLittle guy, are you truly going?\u201d The group of children stopped their training and all surrounded him.\u201cEn!\u201d Little Shi Hao nodded. He had already decided yesterday, and he wasn\u2019t going to change his mind now.\u201cA journey of 300,000 li, so far. We\u2019re all still so young, why are you going to such a distant place?\u201d The child widened their eyes as this astronomical number made them feel a bit dizzy.\u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d\u201cTomorrow!\u201d The little aimed his gaze towards a group of unicorns. If he couldn\u2019t soar across the sky, then using an extremely fast vicious beast as transportation wouldn\u2019t be bad either.\u201cAh, you\u2019re going to catch a unicorn?\u201d The group of children all exposed their excitement. They wanted to do this a long time ago, but they didn\u2019t have enough power.Even Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and those other adults were always scheming, but they didn\u2019t dare to act blindly without thinking. With pure white bodies and flickering silver scales, those unicorns were very strong; they wouldn\u2019t surrender to any normal person.However, their fame didn\u2019t come from their battle strength. Compared to their ability to rapidly travel 10,000 li in a day, that so called \u2018strength\u2019 really didn\u2019t account for much.The little guy stood up and identified one of the tall and spirited male unicorns. Its its body was burning with a silver fire, and its sturdy figure stood on four tall and thin legs. With eyes like crystals and a horn on its forehead, it was wrapped in silver light.\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201dAfter little Shi Hao acquired his target, he took a detour around Stone Village and entered some shrubs in order to cut off the unicorn from the other side. The group of children all stared their eyes wide open, and held their breaths as they calmly watched.\u201cWhat are these children doing?\u201d A group of adults were alarmed.\u201cWhat, catching a unicorn?\u201d With a shout, a bunch of males and females came out of the village to watch from the lake side.The little guy rushed out and appeared by some nearby shrubs, and sprinted towards the lakeside in order to surround and block the group of unicorns. He marked that particular tall target among them.The lakeside was suddenly disturbed, and all kinds of precious birds and strange beasts perched here began to cry out at this uninvited guest. The approaching figure was full of hostility despite being so young.The group of unicorns were startled in particular, since they were obviously an intelligent species. They still remembered the fact that the little guy once single-handedly lifted up a huge hundred thousand jin boulder by the lake. Every one of them were worried as they shined all over.\u201cLittle guy, careful!\u201d The villagers cried out in alarm.The group of unicorns suddenly moved and stamped their four hooves into the the ground. Symbols interweaved all over their bodies as they all faced outward while simultaneously activating their attacks.With a\u00a0weng\u00a0sound,\u00a0silver like light poured down like a storm, creating a huge area of vast whiteness that was difficult to dodge. Some of the rocks on the ground had even been penetrated.The little guy didn\u2019t slow down, but instead spread his two arms. He rapidly streaked horizontally thirty meters forward like an eagle soaring through the sky; his movements were beautiful yet powerful. It absolutely didn\u2019t seem like something a child could do.\u201cSuch a fast movement technique!\u201d Even the village elders were shocked.This was a movement technique that the little guy had seen studying from\u00a0the True Primordial Record\u2019s \u2018divine battle records\u2019. It was the battle spirit of a Golden Winged Peng, and that kind of mysterious movement as well as usage of symbols left him with a deep impression.Right now, golden symbols flickered on both his arms and began to whistle like the wind. Like a Golden Winged Peng, he streaked across the sky with a beautiful appearance that contained a formidable strength.Chi Chi\u2026The unicorns released a lone hiss. Their horns were shining as they all shot out beams of light formed from their symbols, striking forward. If one didn\u2019t examine it closely, they might have thought it was actually lightning.The little guy quickly dodged behind a boulder that weighed over ten thousand jin. However, as he leaned over, that boulder was smashed apart, causing rubble to fly into the sky.He quickly charged toward the side in a shocking path just like a Golden Peng flying across the sky. He unexpectedly spiraled half circle in the air as he charged into the group of unicorns.\u201cWow!\u201d The group of children shouted. The little guy\u2019s body was in the air, yet he could actually change directions. He was truly like an Archaic Divine Bird that was spreading its wings with lightning fast speed.A wave of restlessness spread across the group of unicorns. Their hooves treaded the ground with no chance of initiating a group attack again. Their silver scales flickered all over their body as each of them held their heads and hissed while trampling forward.\u201cThe little guy is too fast. In a short distance, he\u2019s absolutely much faster than those unicorns. It\u2019s simply impossible for an ordinary person to approach them, but he was actually able to charge into the herd of beasts!\u201d admired Shi Feijiao. It would still be impossible for people like him even if their strength was drastically improved.With an astonishing speed that surpassed the speed of those vicious beasts, the little guy entered the herd, however, it was even more dangerous now. On one side, hooves stamped over ferociously and on the other, light beams struck towards him. It was incredibly difficult to avoid.Like the sound of a divine clock, the little guy\u2019s entire body began to shine. Divine light transformed into symbols, and after arranging themselves in the air, they wrapped themselves around his body to block this round of incoming attacks.\u201cGo away!\u201dThe little guy violently pushed, and seven to eight unicorns immediately flew out horizontally. How strong was he? Without the mysterious power of the Bone Text, a fling of his arm would be able to exert a divine power of 108000 jin. However, he didn\u2019t deliver any killing blows, as these strange beasts were rare. In the future, if they could make them all yield, they would be an incomparably valuable treasure for the villagers.Xiu.The little guy rushed forwards and leapt on the back of that tall unicorn. Although it was covered densely in silver scales, there were still some silver white hair on the back of its neck. He grabbed that spot and wasn\u2019t willing to let go even if he died.This precious mount neighed with its resonant voice as it was reigned by the neck. Like a huge boulder, it soared into the sky. It could be called a fine and robust divine spirited horse, and it was incredibly outstanding!\u201cLittle horse, don\u2019t be so noisy. Go with me together to look around in the outside world. It might be greatly beneficial for your cultivation,\u201d the little guy leaned over its ear and lightly said.However, this unicorn went into a fit of rage. It was a vicious beast, how could it compare to ordinary horses? No matter what, it was a strange species with a speed that was extremely formidable within the mountains.Under normal circumstances, a unicorn wasn\u2019t a creature that a normal expert in the Blood Transformation Realm could capture. They had extraordinary strength, and dashed with a divine speed. They also inherited some simple symbols, so they were very special.The unicorns and the scaled horses were both descendants of the Archaic Heaven Horse, and were considered the posterity of a mythological beast. Although their blood were extremely diluted, they could still show some power.This tall unicorn violently neighed like the sound of thunder and struggled endlessly. However, under the huge strength of the little guy, its so called divine strength was too weak, and it had difficulty struggling.Little Shi Hao exerted some strength and pushed downwards. Its head that was previously held high up in the air directly hung down. Finally, Shi Hao jumped down onto the ground, lifted it up, and charged violently out of the beast herd.The group of unicorns were in huge disorder and neighed unceasingly, but they couldn\u2019t do anything since the little guy was too powerful. With his boundless strength, he continuously sent ten vicious beasts flying.\u201cCaptured alive\u2026getting one just like that?\u201d The group of onlookers were all dumbstruck.The little guy made whooshing sounds as he sprinted, and directly carried a tall unicorn back. Its four hooves faced the sky, and it struggled fruitlessly.Shi Feijiao and the others had been planning for many days, yet they still hadn\u2019t taken any actions so they did not capture a single one. Now, the little guy did this and unexpectedly succeeded so easily.That was a precious mount, yet it was captured so easily.\u201cLittle guy catch a few more.\u201d A group of adults salivated.\u201cUncle, if I catch anymore, they are going to be frightened and escape, perhaps never returning in the future. After I tame this unicorn and treat it well to make it feel our goodwill, perhaps in the future the other unicorns would see this and voluntarily approach us.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dThe villagers nodded since this methods was not bad. A group of elders were all gurgling water within their mouths because they never even dreamed of possessing such a precious mount.That day, the unicorns never stopped neighing by the beautiful lake. Although the little guy caught one, he didn\u2019t truly tame it. It neighed non-stop as it ran wildly on the green grass.\u201cLittle White, don\u2019t be angry anymore. Just follow me and I\u2019ll teach you some profound Bone Texts and in the future, genuine symbols will form on your bones and your horn. At that time, you might become like Zi Yun or Da Peng and create your own primitive precious bone. Only at that point would you truly be considered a powerful vicious beast,\u201d advised the little guy.Only until dusk did this tall and divine mount, a unicorn, surrender without any resistance anymore. The little guy didn\u2019t say much and showed it a bunch of symbols right away.\u201cAh, this unicorn isn\u2019t making noise anymore?\u201d The children all ran over in anticipation to ride it.However, Little White almost kicked backwards into the nasally kid, and made him so scared he fell downwards onto his buttocks.\u201cOh my goodness. You almost made me spout out large mouthfuls of blood.\u201d The nasally kid still had some lingering fear, and excessively beat his own chest.Although this unicorn had surrendered, it didn\u2019t allow anyone else to approach it.The next morning, the little guy told the villagers that he was preparing to leave.All the villagers came, including elders as old as eighty to ninety years old and babies that were still suckling on breast milk. The chief, uncles, older brothers, older sisters, and aunts all came to send him off.\u201cChild, don\u2019t force yourself. If you find danger after travelling a bit, you must return.\u201d\u201cLittle guy, be careful on the road, don\u2019t show off, and protect yourself well!\u201dEveryone warned and urged him, and all of them were reluctant to part with him. A few aunts\u2019 eyes even turned red. They thought back to this kid who had once drank their breast milk, and they considered him a true member of their family.Finally, the little guy set off on his journey. He rode on the unicorn and charged into the distance as he waved goodbye behind him.With a\u00a0sou\u00a0sound, a\u00a0golden light rushed forth and rapidly caught up, hanging itself on the tail of the unicorn.\u201cAya! Hairy Ball followed.\u201d\u201cNo problem, having this little thing in the village is completely harmful. It wants to eat a large portion of Dragon Horned Elephant daily. Without the little guy, we wouldn\u2019t be able to raise it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a golden Zhuyan, perhaps it could help the little guy out a lot.\u201dIn the air, Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing chirped and followed for over a hundred li to see him off. Under little Shi Hao\u2019s constant warning, they reluctantly turned back.\u201cAncient country, here I come!\u201d The little guy told himself and clenched his fist, then he urged the unicorn on and it became a streak of silver light. It rushed into the endless mountains to traverse the mountain range before dashing into the distance.The unicorn\u2019s speed was truly fast, and it also had a keen perception, allowing it to avoid many dangerous vicious birds and fierce beasts. Just as noon hit, it had already sprinted a distance of three to four hundred li.This unicorn was truly extraordinary. It pierced the valleys and climbed the mountains. When it tread on flat ground, its speed was extremely fast.Zhizhi\u2026\u00a0Suddenly, the fist sized golden Hairy Ball began to scream. All the hair on its body stood erect, and its eyes were staring wide open as it fidgeted restlessly.At the same time, that tender green branch of the willow tree within Stone Village flourished with light. It charged into the horizon, and its scorched black tree trunk unexpectedly also ferociously swayed. With a slight rustling noise, a large portion of its cracked old skin fell to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were completely grey and brown, and for an unknown reason, no vegetation grew within this area.Along the way, there were many enormous rocks scattered on the mountain ground. They weighed from tens of thousands of jin to hundreds of thousands of jin.When the little guy saw the hair on Hairy Ball\u2019s body explode, he was amazed at first. However, after seeing it shiver all over, he felt a bit of fear. This was its instinctive sense, and it did not necessarily mean that it saw something.The cold hair on its body was erect and its large eyes stared all over trying to find something, but it could not find anything after all.\u201cHairy Ball, what did you find?\u201d The little guy inquired.The golden fist sized hairy ball was screeching as its large and round eyes stared. It didn\u2019t know what was happening either, only that it instinctively felt a sense of danger as it fidgeted around restlessly.Finally, the unicorn\u2019s four hooves stamped on the spot and became restless as well. It felt a terrifying aura, and didn\u2019t want to rush into the mountain range any furtherZhizhi\u2026\u00a0Suddenly Hairy Ball rushed out like a streak of golden light. It wanted to pass over the mountain ridges and enter the depths of the mountains.\u201cHairy Ball, don\u2019t be reckless!\u201d The little guy shouted loudly and urged his mount to chase after it.The unicorn was completely unwilling, but it couldn\u2019t resist the little guy. Its entire horn flickered with silvery light and emitted crackling sounds as symbols converged together.After rushing in several hundred li, Hairy Ball suddenly stopped. A wave of doubt appeared in its eyes as it lost its previous feeling of danger, and he began to calm down again.The mountains ahead of them were full of vegetation, and ancient trees reached into the skies. It greatly contrasted with the barren mountains behind them, and life was flourishing here. Vegetation was rich, the chirping of birds could be heard, and ferocious beasts appeared.Looking back, that grey brown colored mountain was lifeless. Without a single blade of grass growing, it made it appear even more desolate. There was an indescribable mist that surged forth, as if a devil\u2019s den covered in endless years of dust was going to open.\u201cYa, we passed through?\u201d The little guy was shocked. He believed that there was danger in front of them, and never imagined that it actually came from that land without a single blade of grass.Kacha.A strange sound transmitted from the huge mountain behind them, and it sounded as if the ground was cracking. Large boulders were being shifted around, and close behind,\u00a0hualala\u00a0sounds could be heard from iron chains.This sound was suddenly emitted from that lifeless land, and it sounded like the voices of demons from the depths of hell. Mist bubbled up as a wretched aura surged forth from that direction.Suddenly, with a\u00a0peng\u00a0sound, several large mountains collapsed without the slightest warning, and a grey brown colored mist rose, terrifying everyone.\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d The little guy opened his eyes wide. The unicorn he sat on began to tremble slightly, as if it was going to limp on the ground.Hairy Ball screeched and jumped onto the little guy\u2019s shoulders. It made threatening gestures towards that area over ten li away while being impatient and restless.Several large mountains collapsed and the earth cracked open. Those pitch black cracks were so shockingly huge that even an entire mountain could fall through. However at this moment, a huge green claw reached out, but it was sealed in pure gold.\u201cHeavens, what kind of creature is this?\u201d The little guy was astonished.It was merely a claw, yet it was already bigger than several large mountains put together. Just by reaching out, it caused many huge mountains to collapse and the earth to crack.The mist was like the ocean, and dust soared into the sky. Its huge claw stabbed high into the sky, and it was trying to struggle free with all its might; it was as if it wanted to break out of the ground.Between the thick paws and those not so sharp claws, there was a layer of stone that practically sealed its claws. One could imagine that it had been trapped for many years.The large claw violently struggled, and the sounds of rocks grinding became even louder. They resonated between the heaven and earth as the pure golden chain became taut. It was using all of its strength, making the chains created\u00a0hualala\u00a0sounds, as if it was a frightening song originating from the underworld.Dong.In the end, that huge green claw powerlessly fell down. Smoke and dust raised into the air as it disappeared beneath the floor. The sounds stopped as well, and the mist gradually retreated, leaving behind a terrifying area of destruction.After a long while, there hadn\u2019t been any more commotion, and it was almost as if nothing had happened in the first place.The little guy\u2019s mind was blown and was speechless for a long time. The great desolate lands indeed had many vicious birds and fierce beasts. After leaving just a few hundred li, he had already encountered such a huge creature. Furthermore, with Hairy Ball being so restless, that had to have been an incredibly powerful Supreme Being.The golden Zhuyan was constantly angry. It gestured and grimaced at the chaotic land, and it looked as if it wanted to fight with that thing. The little guy directly grabbed that golden tail and carried it backwards, ignoring its resistance. He urged his unicorn to quickly run forward without stopping.An early morning several days later, the little guy opened his eyes and washed himself in the mountain springs. After that, he ate some meat, drank some water, and took to the road again.\u201cOnward towards the direction of sunrise. Ancient country border, here I come!\u201d The little guy clenched his little fists and encouraged himself.During the course of several days, they advanced tens of thousands of li. With a creature like the unicorn, the speed of the journey was extremely fast. During this entire journey, they bore through valleys and climbed over mountains, avoiding quite a few vicious beasts.Naturally, there were several unavoidable situations where battles occurred. Up until the current moment, they still hadn\u2019t completely shaken off their pursuer. A five color striped bug had been chasing them for two days.That descendant had perseverance. So long as the little guy\u2019s group stopped, it would follow their scent and catch up. It\u00a0endlessly chased after them.This was a striped bug over ten meters long that had terrifying strength. It had rough skin and thick flesh, and it could spit a liquid from its mouth that was able to penetrate a mountain boulder.According to the little guy\u2019s speculations, this was much more powerful than that divine wolf from the Wolf Village. It comprehended the strength from a powerful mysterious symbol that caused its entire body to shine. The only thing to rejoice about was that it couldn\u2019t catch up to the unicorn.\u201cLet\u2019s go; otherwise, that big bug will kill us.\u201d The little guy flipped himself onto his mount. He believed that after a few days of chasing and not sleeping, that big bug would eventually get tired and give up.The Unicorn held its head high and released a long neigh as silvery light flickered all over its body.Suddenly, the little guy became startled and said, \u201cQuickly, it\u2019s coming again.\u201dPu.As soon as they rushed out, a wave rushed over, and mist descended onto the mountain floor. Suddenly, all the ancient trees and mountain boulders melted. As\u00a0chichi\u00a0sounds rang out, they became white smoke.With a\u00a0weng\u00a0sound,\u00a0the area began to flicker with symbols, and like an inescapable net, it dropped towards this area.\u201cFaster!\u201d the little guy shouted.With a\u00a0hong\u00a0sound,\u00a0that area of the mountain floor cracked in every direction, causing smoke and dust to surge. The situation was incredibly dangerous, and they ran away as far as they could.A large five colored bug appeared. It was only as thick as a water jar but brilliant symbols flickered all over its body. It wasn\u2019t a python, but it was even more sinister. It angrily yelled out after barely missing them again and twisted its huge body, razing this entire mountain forest to the ground.Suddenly, a bird cry sounded. Like a black cloud descending from the sky, an enormous figure of a huge bird over a hundred meters long swooped down from the cloud bank.The big bug panicked and hastily raised its head. It spouted out a multicolored light in order to defend itself with its symbols.Pu.The vicious bird covered the sky and hid the sun. It opened its mouth, and a light beam that seemed like a river of stars descended. The entire mountain floor was flattened, and rubble flew into the sky as this big bug was immediately hacked into many pieces.The huge bird swooped down and began its bloody feast!This was the great wasteland; there were dangers and terrifying creatures everywhere. A moment before it could have been an awe-inspiring force, but the next moment it could turn into another creature\u2019s food.This was a world where the strong ate the weak, and blood was spilt everywhere, and it was a place without reason.But the little guy who was going to traverse the wilds for 300,000 li could be said to be on a journey filled with untold dangers and difficulties, and it was possible that he could lose his life at any moment.Following this, the little guy had repeatedly fought bloody battles and encountered many great dangers. He beheaded many ferocious beasts, as there was no other way. If his actions were a bit weaker, he would have become something else\u2019s food.This was merely eight or nine days,\u00a0yet\u00a0his clothes were already ragged. All his clothes were dyed in blood\u00a0and\u00a0ripped apart, and in the end, he could only change into the peeled skin of beasts in order to cover himself.This type of uninhabited land often had unimaginably terrifying creatures, and at that moment, the only choice was to hide far away. The good news\u00a0was, however, that excessively powerful existences only\u00a0had other\u00a0tyrannical creatures in their sights, and wouldn\u2019t pay much attention to them.However, creatures as powerful as the big multicolored bug, which were not the strongest creatures, posed the greatest threat to them. On their journey, there was a strange ape. Once its symbols were shown, the world shook, and a rocky mountain collapsed. It chased them for three days and three nights until it finally gave up.On this journey, he encountered countless bloody battles. If he couldn\u2019t win, he would run, and in less than ten days, he looked a little savage. His body was covered in the blood of vicious birds and fierce beasts, as he did not even have time to wash himself.Currently, he was rushing along the route, and whenever he stopped, he would immediately eat and rest afterwards. The mountains were incredibly dangerous, and they couldn\u2019t afford to waste any time. They had to conserve as much of their strength as possible.Following this, he suffered a heavy injury. When he went to find a water source, an Alligator Flood Dragon suddenly rushed out of the cold water and pounced on him. Its symbols activated and suppressed each direction, and it seemed as if it wanted to kill him.This was the first time in the little guy\u2019s life that he suffered such a heavy injury. His powerful flesh had been destroyed, and his bones were exposed. Under the Alligator Flood Dragon\u2019s mysterious symbol power, he was almost crushed to death.In the end, when this Alligator Flood Dragon wanted to swallow the little guy for his meal, the little guy found a chance. He swung one of his arm that had a divine strength of 108,000 jin, and when it approached, he immediately ripped apart the Alligator Flood Dragon\u2019s claws, dying the cold water in bloody red.He used this chance and took it a step further, stomping open the Alligator Flood Dragon\u2019s skull and nearly smashing it into pieces.This Alligator Flood Dragon was in serious pain as it struggled violently. It dove into the cold water head first, and the little guy used this opportunity to escape far away from this place.The unicorn in the distance heard some commotions and quickly galloped over. It carried him on its back, and escaped from this area to escape this near death situation.That Alligator Flood Dragon was extremely savage. While it was suffering from pain, it rushed out of the water surface and opened its mouth to spit out multicolored light, immediately flattening the top of a mountain. If it wasn\u2019t for a terrifying huge bird streaking across the sky and forcing it to retreat back into the water, it would have certainly chased after and tried to kill them.The following few days, Hairy Ball found all kinds of strange fruits, and in a rare feat of generosity, it bit open its own skin to squeeze out three drops of golden blood, helping the little guy\u2019s wounds heal and feel better.It was quite obvious that the fist-sized golden Zhuyan\u2019s blood possessed a divine effect. After the little guy\u2019s injuries healed, not a single trace of a scar remained.After half a month, the little was already 200,000 li away from Stone Village. This unicorn\u2019s speed was extremely fast, and was quite a bit stronger than others from its species. There was only 100,000 li remaining from the ancient country.The little guy truly became a little savage. He was covered in dirty blood all over, and after completely drying up, they turned into bloody scabs, and his pitch black hair began to stick together.Zhizhi\u2026At dawn while the little guy was still sleeping, Hairy Ball rushed out from within the heart of the ancient mountain range. It was carrying an egg that was as large as a stone roller while emitting a shocking multicolored light.Little Shi Hao heard some noise and suddenly sat up, and he immediately saw this scene. Hairy Ball was blinking with a joyfully satisfied expression, and it carried an extremely large egg. Who knew how many times larger the egg was than the Zhuyan\u2019s body, and it was very as it happily endlessly shrieked.This sparkling egg was covered densely with rainbow stripes. It was very beautiful, and streaks of multicolored light shot out, making it seem extremely extraordinary. Despite the fact that it was still an egg, it already emitted a terrifying aura.Without needing to think much, this was definitely an extraordinary object. The little guy even suspected that this was the heir of a divine bird; otherwise, how could it be so abnormal?\u201cYou\u2026 stole it?\u201dZhizhi\u2026\u00a0Hairy Ball protested. With an innocent and earnest expression, it slapped its little chest. It was as if it was asking \u2018am I that type of person\u2019?Suddenly, within the heart of the mountain, a terrifying bird screech rang out, shaking the entire mountain range. An astonishing killing intent exploded forth like a violent tsunami.With a\u00a0ba ji\u00a0sound,\u00a0Hairy Ball immediately threw the egg towards the little guy and escaped onto the back of the unicorn. Without any sense of loyalty, it wanted to forcefully escape.After seeing this, how could the little guy not know what the situation was? He held the rainbow colored egg and immediately jumped onto the back of the unicorn, frantically making his escape.\u201cHairy Ball, you stirred up trouble again!\u201d criticized the little guy.Hairy Ball looked up into the sky and ignored it, but in the end it secretly shot a glimpsed into the heart of the mountain range. After seeing a demonic and omnipresent aura coming over, it began to worry. With a screech, it jumped onto the ground and found a sturdy rock before scuttling back. He took the rock and began to dig into the shell.\u201cAh, you are going to dig straight into such a mystical egg?\u201d The little guy was hesitant.Hairy Ball made a gesture with the meaning that it was\u00a0for \u2018supplementing the\u00a0body\u2019. In reality, its own saliva was gurgling\u00a0as it fell onto the unicorn\u2019s back.Over ten li away, there was a party of people in another region headed by a graceful beauty that was out of this world. Her charming face was sparkling white, and she had big spirited eyes. Her body was elegant, and white clothes covered her body. She followed the wind as she hunted as if she wanted to use the wind to her advantage. Beside her, there was an old woman, as well as over ten other extraordinary experts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her beautiful hair was dark and soft like smooth silk, and her sparkling white and oval face did not reveal any nervousness as she gazed into the heart of the mountains with her vivid eyes. \u201cBeing so distant, it should not be able to discover us.\u201dIn the heart of the mountains, bird cries resounded like the sound of ten thousand interweaving swords and ten thousand galloping horses. Its voice shook the entire mountain, and huge boulders were tumbling down, as if an earthquake was occurring. It was clearly visible just how scary this vicious bird was.From a\u00a0distance, rays of light that collided with the heavens and fluctuated like the seas were emitted, and it was as if an eternal divine furnace burned between the heaven and earth. As if a deity was descending into the world, light illuminated every direction.\u201cThis vicious bird should be a descendant of an Archaic Divine Bird. Originally, we thought it was undergoing a breakthrough and needed to swallow a tribe with over a million people to develop its blood essence. Only later did we find out that it was actually laying an egg,\u201d spoke a middle aged male.\u201cThis is a powerful descendant that has the blood of the Archaic God Bird, the Peacock King flowing through it. Its egg is extremely important, and we have to get our hands on it. After carefully raising it, it might even reconstruct a portion of the Archaic God King\u2019s might. Its precious technique was once reputed as unparalleled!\u201d The old woman cried out in excitement, and although she was old, she still had a bright spirit and her eyes flickered with silver symbols.This kind of Archaic Descendant was already a rare and powerful creature. Tracing back to its origin and root, its egg seemed even more mysterious and precious.To obtain a mature Rainbow Peacock\u2019s precious technique from its body was fundamentally impossible. Let alone the terrifying price one would need to pay to capture it, in just a single moment, it could\u00a0easily shatter its own symbols, making the entire process pointless.That time when Stone Village obtained the Suan Ni\u2019s corpse and discovered that it still had its primitive symbols was actually an extremely rare event. That was a unique circumstance that only happened then.If one wanted to trace the origins of the Archaic God Bird\u2014Peacock King\u2019s secrets, it was impossible to obtain it from a mature descendant. The only way was to aim for its egg and breed its descendant beside them. Only then could they peer into the boundaries of the Archaic God Bird\u2019s precious technique.\u201cThere might have been an accident, so we need to chase it down quickly. Everyone, deal with this carefully.\u201d The white-clad woman\u2019s eyes swiveled as her rosy lips gently informed. Her teeth were sparkling white, and she had a very pleasant voice that had a unique beauty to it.\u201cIt just laid\u00a0an egg, so its body should be in a weakened state. This is the best opportunity.\u201d Everyone nodded.They didn\u2019t know that what they were worried about came true. The Archaic God King\u2019s descendant had lost its own egg and was going crazy. It flew everywhere while searching and chasing after the one who stole its egg.\u201cLittle White, run faster. It appeared!\u201d The little guy turned around and saw a divine rainbow of light rush into the heavens. That vigorous life force that seemed like an ocean wave that struck against the shore; it was extremely shocking.An enormous peacock came out from the heart of the mountains by itself. It was enveloped by a layer of light, and it emitted a rainbow colored light. With a beat of its wings, it swept away everything clean, including the trees and boulders.Pu.Hairy Ball\u2019s little claw was very sneaky. It grabbed a solid rock and waved it with all its might in order to pierce through this rainbow colored egg. The outcome was that the rock had been smashed to pieces, and the eggshell was not damaged in the slightest as it still circulated in sparkling radiance.The little guy was immediately scared and said, \u201cHairy Ball, don\u2019t do anything rash. That vicious bird will catch up quickly. From my point of view, let\u2019s just throw this egg away and run for our lives.\u201dThe fist-sized golden Hairy Ball\u2019s large eyes swiveled within its sockets as it embraced the rainbow colored egg. It glanced at the little guy from its side with the meaning, \u2018this is mine, throwing it away is forbidden.\u2019In addition, it suddenly made an astonishing action at this moment. If a rock couldn\u2019t pierce through it, it was going to bite through it, and it used its mouthful of sparkling little teeth to bite the eggshell.\u201cAya!\u00a0Hairy Ball stop biting!\u201d shouted the little guy. This was a mysterious and powerful precious egg. He was always thinking that if it truly gave birth, he might be able to obtain one more world shocking precious technique.Right now, he had already grasped the \u2018True Primordial Record\u2019, so his cultivation was not a problem anymore. What he was missing the most was a precious technique.At the present age, a precious technique was extremely rare. Even a large tribe with tens of millions of people might only have one clan-suppressing precious technique supported by a few other abilities. Wanting to look for some more was simply impossible.Kacha.Under the little guy\u2019s shocking gaze, Hairy Ball\u2019s little snow white teeth actually succeeded in biting open the eggshell. Rainbow colored divine light circulated as a scary powerful essence energy fluctuate violently.\u201cHair Ball, you wastrel!\u201d The little guy was angry and regretful as he gripped its leg and carried it backwards. Even like this, Hairy Ball still did not let its mouth go as it forcefully bit into the eggshell while hanging there, biting as if his life depended on it.Everything was too late. This precious rainbow egg was split open, and the little guy didn\u2019t say anything more either. After all, this was something that Hairy Ball carried back from the heart of the mountains, so he had authority over it.Baii, Baji\u2026Hairy Ball began to sucking happily with all of its strength, and it completely ignored that heaven overflowing rainbow colored divine light behind it. Its little stomach bulged outwards as it sucked with all its might.The sweet fragrance of the sparkling and brilliant liquid seeped out from within the precious rainbow egg and assailed the nostrils. Hairy Ball energetically ate, and it soon forgot itself as it started screeching.Hong!Boundless divine light covered the earth as rubble flew into the air, and almost sent the unicorn flying. If not for the fact that it was extremely quick while rapidly changing directions, it would have been struck by one of the huge boulders from the collapsing mountains.\u201cIt caught up!\u201d The little guy\u2019s scalp numbed. This was an extremely powerful Archaic Descendant. It was a being they had absolutely no chance of resisting right now.The Rainbow Peacock did not see them, but it knew that the thief who stole its egg went in this direction. It killed everything as it chased in extreme anger.The only consolation was that the unicorn ran really fast. If it was any other creature, they might have been caught in the blink of an eye. However even like this, being caught was an eventual matter.The Archaic Descendant\u2019s speed far outstripped that of the unicorn\u2019s. If it wasn\u2019t for the forest blocking its line of sight, it could have killed them with a beat of its wings.The golden Hairy Ball finally became a bit nervous and ditched the precious rainbow egg to the little guy. It grabbed its ears and scratched its head, wanting to use its precious technique. However, after whimpering for a while, it still hadn\u2019t displayed its three heads and six arms, and began to anxiously cry.Upon seeing this, the little guy couldn\u2019t attend to this much longer anyway. He carried the sparkling egg and began to suck it into his mouth as well. Shortly after he gulped it down completely, his body began to emit various gorgeous and dazzling colored lights.With a\u00a0weng\u00a0sound,\u00a0his entire body began to shine, and symbols converged densely. He was unexpectedly about to make a breakthrough into the next realm.\u201cYa, not good, Willow Deity naturally had a good reason to tell me to suppress it for a month. Right now, breaking through to the next stage isn\u2019t too good.\u201d The little guy was alarmed.He remembered back in the \u2018True Primordial Record\u2019, there was a record of an Archaic Devil Bird, the Heaven Swallowing Sparrow that could swallow 100 million creatures in one mouthful. The blood essence it refined was stored within its body, and it would only use it when it needed to.The little guy had been comprehending that engraving picture for a long time. Although he didn\u2019t have the Heaven Swallowing Sparrow\u2019s symbol activation methods, he was still able to understand a little bit of it. He could store the essence energy into his own body.With a\u00a0weng\u00a0sound,\u00a0his entire body shined. One symbol after another brightened into miniature divine furnaces, and stored all of the essence energy inside.His body shined all over. Each of them were genuine, however, the divine furnaces were rather small. It emitted light from every inch of his flesh, swallowing the essence energy and storing it inside.\u201cWillow Deity said that it was better to enter the next realm with as thick of a foundation as possible. The more abundant essence energy I have, the better my accomplishments will be. Right now, this should be an adequate prior preparation.\u201d The little guy kept gulping down the rainbow colored bird egg\u2019s contents. Sparkling luster circulated all over him, and he had practically forgotten the danger he was in since he was so engrossed into it.Zhizhi\u2026\u00a0Hairy Ball was crying out nonstop. Although this good-for-nothing sensed the danger behind it, it still had not forgotten to eat. It wanted to snatch that precious sparkling egg from the little guy to continue devouring it.The entire egg was as large as a stone roller. It was bright and shiny all over as it emitted multicolored light in every direction. A large portion of the juice inside had entered the little guy\u2019s stomach, but his little stomach had not seen any swelling.His insides were shining as one symbol after another brightened up to absorb the essence energy. The contents were all refined into light, and stored into these glittering symbols.The little guy burped loudly as he truly could not drink anymore. Rainbow God King\u2019s descendant \u2014 an Archaic Descendant, the essence energy its egg contained was extremely abundant.Hairy Ball snatched it over immediately and embraced it while gulping it down. His large eyes swiveled as it glanced at its rear. That Rainbow Peacock had discovered them, and it was absolutely furious; it wanted to kill them immediately.\u201cLittle White, charge forward!\u201d the little guy shouted.They rushed onto a lofty mountain peak that had a torrential river below them. The water surface was unexpectedly ten li wide, and the surging waves sounded like thunder. It was incredibly astonishing.Furthermore, this large river was so dark that it was rather frightening. One could sense its cold aura from far away, and there were no creatures in its surroundings.The Archaic Descendant released a long cry as its killing intent poured into the heavens. Rays of light exploded all over its body as it dove down immediately with the intention of devouring them whole. Not long ago, it had devoured over a hundred million people, and that kind of extremely terrifying demonic aura had not yet dispersed.\u201cLittle White jump down!\u201d The little guy shouted loudly. Right now, they could not care much more. The large black river below the huge mountain obstructed their path. Their only option is to enter the waters for a chance to escape this disaster.The unicorn hesitated. In its opinion, this river did not make it feel more at ease than that Archaic Descendant behind it, as it made its heart tremble in the same way. However, in the end, it still clenched its teeth and jumped in.The little guy immediately snatched away the rainbow colored egg from Hairy Ball, and held the unicorn\u2019s neck in order to pour the rest of the juice into its mouth. Soon after, it fell into the river with a\u00a0putong\u00a0sound.Just as it entered the river, the unicorn\u2019s blood had practically frozen over due to the extreme cold. Although the water was not frozen, it contained a mysterious power that made it so cold that bodies would shatter.The little guy felt as if his entire body was being stabbed by needles as the cold penetrated into his bones, practically piercing into his soul. It was extremely uncomfortable.Even the golden Hairy Ball was grimacing. It flailed its little claws and kicked its little feet; evidently, it was very uncomfortableThat Archaic Descendant dove down from mid-air, but it hesitated after approaching. In the end, it did not enter the water, and angrily cried out instead. Its rainbow colored divine light surged and destroyed the lofty mountain below.Underwater, the unicorn struggled since it was in great discomfort. Its blood had nearly stopped flowing, however, fortunately in the end, it drank the rainbow colored egg\u2019s juice, which transformed into a multi-colored light that prevented it from dying.They did not expose themselves out of the water surface and continued to endure the pain, as their bodies flowed downstream to avoid being killed.Not being able to breathe did not mean much. Back when the little guy was sealed in the medicine cauldron to make a breakthrough with the Suan Ni\u2019s blood, he was isolated from the outside world. Divine light circulated within his body, and provided everything he needed.Above the river, the Archaic Descendant released its long cries. Its gorgeous tail feathers were bright like the color of flames. With a wing beat, it collapsed all the nearby mountains and followed into the river to chase.However, this black river water was extremely mysterious, and prevented its divine sense from being able to detect a hint of the egg thief\u2019s aura.Even so, it still chased for four hours and continuously paced back and forth between this region of the river to find its enemy. Unfortunately, it finally gave up and angrily cried as it left.After roughly half a day, water splashed in all directions, and the little guy\u2019s head was revealed. His body was purple all over, and he spat out a bunch of icy sediments.Hairy Ball shrieked as it jumped out of the water and landed on his head. It embraced its own arms while scuttling and jumping around. It shrieked non-stop since it was ridiculously cold as well.The little guy swam towards the shore while dragging the frozen stiff unicorn and finally carried it onto the grass. As soon as he put it down, the nearby rocks and vegetation suddenly froze over.It was so strange. There was no ice in the water, but it became like this immediately after they climbed to the shore. This kind of cold air was startling.The unicorn suffered a heavy injury from practically being frozen. If the little guy hadn\u2019t used the divine light on his body to nourish its flesh, it would have died in the future without any chance of survival.Even so, its injuries were still extremely heavy. Without any precious medicine, it might not be able to survive.\u201cHairy Ball, you scoundrel. You caused this problem, so quickly make a drop of blood to bring it back to life!\u201d The little guy\u00a0shouted.Hairy Ball was shaking the droplets of water from his fur. After uncontrollably shaking its body, it rolled its eyes with all its strength.The little guy only recovered after a short moment, as he was just about to be frozen over, despite the fact that his body was even stronger than the youth of an Archaic Vicious Beast, he was still almost badly frozen within that river.Finally, the wastrel who caused trouble twice \u2014 Hairy Ball unwillingly squeezed out a drop of its golden blood to revive the unicorn.Beside the large black river, a party of people halted while looking at the mountain peaks the Archaic Descendant destroyed. They were lost in thought because in the old woman\u2019s hand was a little piece of the eggshell that was bitten through and dropped onto the road by Hairy Ball.\u201cWhat kind of creature is this that could actually eat the egg of an Archaic God Bird\u2019s Descendant? This\u2026 is simply too much of a waste, I wish that I could swallow him alive!\u201d a young man angrily said.They never could have imagined that they would discover such a shocking result during their chase.\u201cThe egg thief jumped into Moon River. Whether its alive or not is unknown.\u201d A middle aged man sighed.This river was extremely famous. There was a legend that there were ten heavenly moons. During an ancient battle, nine of them fell and one of them fell into this river, making it a life extinguishing site.During the following few days, the little guy became a savage again. He had no choice but to kill vicious birds and fierce beasts. During his journey through the mountains, his entire body became bloodstained and even the beast skin clothing on his body became worn-out. He was not journeying very fast because the unicorn had not completely recovered yet. Thus, his journey was delayed.After another two days, the unicorn\u2019s wounds were finally almost healed. Not only that, he benefited greatly from drinking the juice of the rainbow bird egg as well as the golden drop of Zhuyan blood, making it an even more lively and spirited mount. The symbols inside its body gradually condensed, and were imprinted onto its bones.Zhizhi\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Hairy Ball warned and suddenly reacted. Its golden fur lost its luster and turned into an ashen white color. At the same time, its large eyes became dispirited and lost all expression.The little guy was flabbergasted, as this Hairy Ball actually pretended to be stupid and became like this. At around the same time, he suddenly also felt a reaction as over ten people surrounded him from all four side.They were headed by a woman in white clothing. Her beautiful hair were draped over her shoulders, and her snow white sparkling skin were as exquisite as jade. She had long eyelashes on her oval face, and her eyes were as bright as crystals. A set of pure and white pearl-like teeth were lined behind her scarlet red lips.Suddenly seeing a group of people within the great wasteland naturally shocked the little guy as he gazed toward them.However, these people were even more shocked since the human across from them was just a child. Being so small, how could he just show up in the wasteland by himself? It was simply preposterous!\u201cLittle junior brother, are you by yourself?\u201d The female leader began to smile brilliantly, and her pair of vivid eyes were extremely lifelike. Her red lips were moist, and her pearl-like teeth flashed, and it made all the hearts of the men present shake.\u201cHello elder sister, I came here with my grandfather,\u201d the little guy bashfully laughed. Although his entire face was stained and the beast skin clothes were worn out and full out blood, his large bright eyes still made people feel a sense of sincerity and simpleness.Everyone nodded as they simply could not believe that a child could journey through such a great wasteland alone. The only explanation was that there was another adult following him nearby.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Such shyness and simplicity made this group of people smile.\u201cLittle junior brother is shy, so cute.\u201d The lead female gently laughed. A rippled circulated within her pupils, and her eyelashes trembled. Her charming pure white face was sparkling as it flickered with an emotionally touching luster.The little guy scratched his head and laughed foolishly without saying much. Hairy Ball, who was beside him, looked even more foolish, like an unintelligent little beast who lifelessly laid on his shoulder.\u201cChild, you\u2019re truly not so simple. Looking at the bloodstains on your body, you should have killed many vicious birds and fierce beasts right?\u201d The older woman spoke, and the silver symbols in her eyes flickered with a deep and unfathomable light, making people shudder.\u201cThat right! It is very dangerous in the mountains and they are so vicious. I could only passively fight back.\u201d The little guy carefully nodded.\u201cLittle junior brother, have you been separated from your grandpa for several days? Otherwise, how can your beast skin clothing be worn out like that?\u201d The lead female lightly laughed. The luster within her eyes seemed dreamlike and was so pretty that it made people\u2019s hearts tremble. Even the expressions of the people by her side changed.\u201cEn, grandpa brought me here for training. He said I could only depend on myself during this severe and rough journey. If my life was not endangered, he would not care.\u201d The little guy appeared to be extremely honest, as if he didn\u2019t conceal anything.The hearts of everyone in the group trembled. No matter how you looked at it, any person who dared to bring a child on a journey into this great wasteland to conduct such cruel training must be an ultra high level expert.The old woman\u2019s eyes were silver, and symbols swiveled like the ebb and flow of the sun and moon; her aura was very powerful. She nodded because outstanding disciples of various nobles all had terrifying experts accompanying them while they trained. Except, letting a child journey within such a terrifying wasteland by himself while fighting vicious birds and fierce beasts was still very rare.A middle aged man nodded and said, \u201cIn recent years, there were a few children that surpassed the ordinary who came out of this vast piece of land. Without the supervision of a senior, they traversed hundreds of thousands of li in the vast wasteland while fighting all kinds of vicious birds and fierce beasts before successfully returning to their clans.Clearly, this group of people were not simple. Although the little guy acted very plain, they did not completely believe him since they were all very astute.\u201cLittle junior brother, you shouldn\u2019t be one of those heaven warping geniuses right? You traveled hundreds of thousands of li of the great wasteland by yourself without the protection of adults.\u201d The pretty and quick-witted woman laughed while speaking. She played with her long black hair, and revealed her fairy like white ears. It was such a small action, yet it moved many of the onlookers\u2019 hearts.\u201cTraversing hundreds of thousands of li alone, they really are strong. Are they not scared of running into any Archaic Descendants?\u201d The little guy shockingly stared wide and said.The group of people all looked at each in belief of his words because those pair of eyes were so pure that it did not contain a hint impurity. He was naturally able to easily gain a favorable impression and trust from people. A child able to traverse a hundred thousand li of a savage mountain alone. How astonishing was that? How could they just randomly encounter such a person.Suddenly, the young woman moved. Her white clothes fluttered as her hips twisted. Her whole body approached like a delicate willow tree. With her pure white jade arm, she struck towards the little guy.The little guy what shocked. They were talking so nicely yet how could they suddenly take action? However, he reacted at lightning speed. During the past two years, he was always fighting against the heavenly might of nature, such as being baptized within a mountain torrent and fiercely battling fierce birds. As soon as he moved, his temperament changed completely.The beams of light within little guy\u2019s large eyes were like two frightening torches. His figure seemed like a crane spreading its wings as he drew out a beautiful trajectory. His right arm stretched forward. With a peng sound, he grabbed that sparkling arm then he fiercely dragged it, making the beautiful woman stumble and lower her body.Who could have imagined a wave of this child\u2019s arm could contain such a world-shocking divine power? At this young age, his large eyes were still so innocent, but his movements were as fast as thunder.All of this happened extremely quickly. The little guy\u2019s figure rapidly turned and stuck behind that beautiful girl\u2019s back. With a peng sound, his left arm pulled in her snow white and jade-like neck, and his right hand\u2019s fingertips lit up. Symbols flickered, and they were pressed against her heart, ready to penetrate through at any given moment.All of his movements finished within a spark\u2019s time, and they were carried out smoothly. The fast as lightning speed shocked the party of people. What kind of position did this white clothed girl have? Yet she actually suffered a huge misfortune under the hands of a child.\u201cElder sister, why did you want to hurt me?\u201d The little guy\u2019s tender voice had an incomprehensible manner. However his very bright eyes were not looking at the white clothed girl but staring at the old woman and the others instead.His beast skin clothes were worn out and covered in red beast blood. Even his little hands contained traces of dry blood. As he pressed against that sparkling and snow white chest, he immediately left behind a few dirty little hand prints.In addition, that swan-like neck was no exception, and had several streaks of black imprints on it, making a distinct contrast with that snow white smooth skin.Not far away, the few young males all had a peculiar expression, but that old woman said in an amiable manner, \u201cChild, we do not have any evil intentions.\u201d\u201cXiu!\u201dSeveral patches of symbols appeared from the white clothed girl\u2019s sparkling skin like a heavenly book. They densely imprinted themselves in midair as they wrapped up her entire body in a splendid light. Like a little fish, she broke out of the little guy\u2019s control.The little guy\u2019s heart was shocked; this girl was truly extraordinary. Like a slippery thing that couldn\u2019t be contained in the hand, her exquisite snow white body seemed to be as agile as a fish in water, and couldn\u2019t be captured easily. She swam out instantly.\u201cLittle junior brother is truly not very simple.\u201d The young girl laughed in genuine amazement, since she was caught by a child in such a short period of time. If the news of this spread, with her position, it would certainly evoke some commotion.After the instant that the beautiful girl swam out, the little guy relaxed and did not give chase. Very innocently, he looked towards her and said, \u201cElder sister, what are doing?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to see little junior brother strength. It\u2019s indeed astonishing. You\u2019re so young and I already sensed a potential as flourishing as the sea.\u201d The white clothed girl nodded.\u201cOh, so it\u2019s like that.\u201d The little guy exposed a smile and embarrassingly laughed and said, \u201cSorry elder sister.\u201dThe group all looked towards the beautiful girl\u2019s chest. The hand print which was exposed on her sparkling skin was too obvious, and her snow white neck was the same as well.The beautiful woman laughed and did not feel awkward or angry at all. Her delicate hands gently brushed, and after brilliant lights and vibrant colors flourished, all those marks disappeared immediately.\u201cI\u2019m Xia Youyu. Little junior brother, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Shi Hao.\u201d The little guy crisply responded.\u201cThis name\u2026\u201d Everyone was stupefied.\u201cIt has spirit. A very good name!\u201d Xia Youyu smiled sweetly.The old woman also showed a benevolent smile and said, \u201cChild, you are truly not simple. No matter what, even if Youyu was any less careful, being able to catch her for an instantly is still extraordinarily amazing.\u201dXia Youyu used her hands to gather up her dark and shiny hair. Her lustering white and charming face, her ears that sparkled like a fairy, and those vivid eyes made her seem otherworldly. Multicolored light flickers on her palms and a tool appear. It seemed like gold but it wasn\u2019t, it also seemed like a rock but it wasn\u2019t either. It was engraved with strips of complicated lines.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d That little guy asked curiously.Xia Youyu handed it over onto his hands and said, \u201cLittle junior brother, protect this well. When the time comes, hand it over to your senior and let them take you to the \u2018Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019.\u201d\u201cHeaven Mending Pavilion\u201d The little guy was puzzled since he did not know what kind of place that was.\u201cThen you should have heard of Zhulu Academy right? They find people who pursue supremacy, and recruit the geniuses of this vast earth in order to show them how to cultivate. The Heaven Mending Pavilion, Divine King Hall, and some other schools are also like this.\u201dThe little guy thought for a bit and did not ask any more questions. He earnestly expressed his gratitude.The people at the side were all shocked. They never could have imagined Xia Youyu would give this talisman to suck a savage-looking child, as this was no ordinary item.Finally, the little guy bid them farewell to express that he was going to continue strengthening himself. He straddled onto the unicorn and traversed into the mountain range. During this course of events, Hairy Ball was constantly lifelessly smacking its lips, and had expressionless eyes like an ordinary little mountain beast.\u201cYouyu, this time you received orders to journey to the western border and only have eight talismans with you. This was the final one and you gave it to that child just like that?\u201d asked a middle aged man.A young man sighed, \u201cA person holding this talisman can enter the Heaven Mending Pavilion, and that signifies that he can reach into heavens with a single step! He would gain priority on all kinds of precious medicine and secret methods of using symbols. This talisman is priceless!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Youyu, Stone Country\u2019s Rain Clan wanted the last talisman that you had. They wanted to pave the way for their extremely powerful heir by letting him enter the Heaven Mending Pavilion. Are you not considering it anymore?\u201d the middle aged man asked.\u201cWith his position and status, it\u2019s clear that the heir won\u2019t be too bad, so passing through Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s trial test won\u2019t be a problem either. The precious medicine that this talisman can obtain, would their clan lack any of that?\u201d Xia Youyu objected.\u201cThis kind of ancient clan cares about its face,\u201d the old woman said.\u201cThen they can seek it from someone else. I set out for the western border and gave away all my talismans.\u201d XIa Youyu laughed.The middle aged man warned and said, \u201cRain Clan is very powerful. You can\u2019t easily offend them, especially in the upcoming years. They are destined for extreme glory, because they are the family of that kid\u2019s mother\u2019s uncle from the Stone Family.\u201dThe old woman heard and frowned, \u201cAlright fine, I\u2019ll go request another talisman. There are a few kingdoms that we cannot easily offend.\u201cNo matter what, that child back then is truly complicated. I feel that if I did not act and he was found by Zhulu Academy, they would definitely snatch him away. If that happened, Heaven Mending Pavilion will regret it.\u201d The white clothed girl said. Searching for the Archaic Descendant\u2019s divine rainbow egg was something they did decided to do along the way, but was the real purpose for this journey.\u201cIs he really strong?\u201d A person from the side asked.\u201cHis potential is terrifying. A wave of his arm contained at least a divine strength of at least \u00a0tens of thousands of jin.\u201d Xia Youyu held back her smile and solemnly said.\u201cSo young yet his body already contains such divine strength?\u201d None of the others could believe it, but they suddenly understood why the white clothed girl was dragged stumbling and almost fell to the ground.\u201cWu, I estimate from looking that if this simple-looking kid did not conceal anything, a swing from both arms together would generate at least a divine strength of 80 to 90 thousand jin purely with the flesh!\u201d The old woman solemnly added.\u201cWhat?!\u201d The group of people all cried out in alarm.\u201cHow could that be possible? 80 to 90 thousand jin of divine strength with a swing of both arms is approaching the checkpoint of the extreme boundary for an Archaic Vicious Beast\u2019s test for their youth!\u201d\u201cThis is an absolute world-shocking genius who is worth snatching and nurturing!\u201dZhulu in chinese means the pursuit of supremacyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was only an estimate, and wasn\u2019t a completely accurate description of the little guy\u2019s hidden strength. However even so, it was still so incredibly astonishing, and it made the group of people sigh endlessly with admiration and regret.\u201cYi\u2026\u201d The old woman frowned, and she felt as if she overlooked something. Her eyes flickered with silver symbols like an illusory celestial river.Suddenly, she raised her head and shot out two frightening beams of light from her eyes. \u201cWe made a mistake!\u201d\u201cHow did we make a mistake?\u201d A youth on the side asked.The old woman took out an lustering eggshell from her bosom. It had stripes like rainbows, and specks of multicolored light all over, making it seem as exquisite as jade; it was precisely that broken piece of the Archaic Descendant egg.\u201cI was careless a moment ago, and just realized it just now. That child and the little mountain beast on his shoulder had a seemingly familiar aura. At first, I thought \u00a0they smelled weird because they were dyed in the blood of many vicious birds and fierce beasts. After thinking over it now carefully, that should have been the aura of the egg birthed by Archaic God\u2019s descendant.\u201dEveryone who heard was shocked.\u201cThat can\u2019t be. That child ate the egg of the Archaic God King\u2019s descendant? That\u2019s way too frightening!\u201d A youth\u2019s mouth was so wide that he could swallow half a fist.\u201cA harmless looking kid actually acted so recklessly and dared to journey into the Archaic Descendant\u2019s nest to steal its egg?\u201dThe group of people practically could not believe it. After reaching this conclusion, all of them were left speechless.Only a few people would believe this situation if someone told them this. He was nothing more than a child, but he actually dared to enter the nest of an Archaic Descendant to create such a shockingly large affair.Their hearts simultaneously became apprehensive, but was also filled with sudden regret. They felt an extreme pity since that was an egg of the Divine Bird\u2019s descendant. As long as they bred and nurtured it, they could definitely have peered into the secrets of the Archaic God King\u2019s precious technique.A precious egg like that was eaten by a child and a mountain beast just like that!What a loss this was. What kind of clan would have a child that did things like these?\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. That little mountain beast ate the rainbow bird\u2019s egg as well? Could it also be extraordinary?\u201d A middle aged man from the party of people questioned.The others who heard this were suddenly startled. How could an ordinary little mountain beast bear the essence energy of an Archaic Descendant? It would inevitably be battered to death by its effect.\u201cThe fist sized little beast\u2026 I vaguely saw the bottom of its foot being scarlet-colored,\u201d said another personThe old woman was emotionally startled, and as if she thought of something, she said, \u201cCould that be the legendary Zhuyan?\u201dAccording to legends, the descent of this vicious beast would inevitably bring chaos. The whole world would fall into a calamity of war, and the earth will become a battleground; this was a horrifying omen.Everyone was stupefied since they unexpectedly met such a strange kid. Everyone in the group was mistaken.The lead white-clad female in the lead laughed, and her black hair drifted in the wind. Her sparkling white skin flickered with a hypnotic luster, and her eyes swiveled as she said, \u201cThis child isn\u2019t very simple. Let\u2019s just treat it like bearing good karma.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hope he will enter the Heaven Mending Pavilion and not be snatched away by any other means!\u201dIn the distant mountains, the little guy urged his mount to madly sprint forth. The unicorn transformed into a silver streak of light and passed through the mountain ridges. It quickly reached the pinnacle of its speed, and the forest on both sides quickly passed by. Soon after, they were several hundreds of li away.The fist sized Hairy Ball completely resurrected. The grey white hairy all over its body flickered and turn gold once again. Its pair of large lifeless and expressionless eyes shined as well, and it weirdly jumped up and down on little Shi Hao\u2019s shoulders.The little guy grabbed its tail, carried it backwards and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t run all over the place, and you can\u2019t get into trouble again. You can only stay by my side!\u201dHe had left Stone Village for twenty one days already, and had already completed a large portion of this endless journey. He was already less than 100,000 li away from Stone Clan\u2019s second ancestral land, and would reach it in just a few days.During the next few days, the little guy rode through thistles and thorns while advancing through the great wasteland, meeting one batch of fierce beasts after another. He experienced hundreds of bloody battles before he finally arrived at the border of Stone Country.He was just a child, yet he traversed the endless mountain ranges within a month. He battled with many vicious birds and strange beasts as he dashed through 300,000 li, and this was an absolutely shocking feat. If news of this got out, it would trigger a lot of controversy, and shake even those deep and hidden ancient families.Even when the Bi\u2019An, Pi Xiu and the other most powerful Archaic Vicious Beast trained their young, this was as far as they pushed. This kind of dangerous ordeal was easy to talk about, but when it came to actually putting it into action, it definitely resulted in death nine out of ten times.For an ordinary child travelling alone, let alone 300,000 li, even 300 li or 3,000 li would be dangerous, and might easily result in them falling prey to the mouths vicious beasts.The western border was full of dense ancient forests that had many fierce beasts residing within. There wasn\u2019t a trace of human establishment, and there were malicious beasts and fierce birds everywhere, making this the most terrifying piece of primal land.Let alone a child, even a group of adult experts together would have difficulty traversing through this land. They might be suddenly eaten by an Archaic Descendant at at any time without even a skull remaining.The little guy had sharp senses, and avoided many terrors and dangers while on this journey, yet he still encountered many life and death ordeals. He had suffered multiple serious injuries along the way, but he still finally made it out in the end.He was just over seven years old, yet he already completely such a magnificent feat!If people knew of this, this would inevitably become stunning news, and it would shake every direction and spread to the rest of the world. If this was known by the likes of Zhulu Academy, they would instantly dispatch experts to find him, making him a member of their academy.When he finally saw the village, the little guy galloped out of the great wasteland while riding on the back of the unicorn.When he stopped and asked around for directions, he couldn\u2019t help but feel stupid. His general direction was not wrong, but he was off by more than 20,000 li.\u201cWu, I\u2019ve obviously followed the route given Willow Deity, but in the end, I was still off by so much. I most likely made a wrong turn somewhere after falling into that long river.\u201d The little guy scratched his head and once again set off.After leaving the endless mountain ranges, there were far less vicious birds and fierce beasts. Relatively speaking, it was much safer, and in two days, he arrived near one of Stone Country\u2019s important border towns.The ancient country was extremely vast, as millions upon millions of li of rivers and mountains rested within its domain. A powerful kingdom within it could have up to hundreds of millions of people, or perhaps even billions; its vast territory was boundless.Such a vast territory would naturally be rather hard to supervise. They could only establish a huge city in the middle of each region to control them. Once a riot occurred within that region, the huge city commanding the area would rapidly send out their experts to calm the insurgency.In reality, Stone Country was at its peak, and did not need help calming down its insurgencies. In particular, the emperor\u2019s powers have reached the heavens during the last few centuries, gaining unrivaled divine might. The country\u2019s powers flourished even more, and no one dared to rebel.Only the regions at the borders would be met unrest at times, as other tribes would often knock on the gates from time to time to rob their clan and devour their food. For such a vast ancient country, however, a few minor battles did not account for much.Rushing Cloud Town could actually be a considered a city, as it had a population of 80,000. It was situated in an extremely important geographic location, and an important town was situated west of it. This was one of the central city\u2019s defensive checkpoints.In the past hundred years, experts from other tribes would invade from time to time, but as long as they wanted to pass through with a large force, they would never succeed.On the road, the little guy met many people in succession, and they were mostly businessmen who had traveled through the ancient forests to purchase beast skin, spirit medicine and other items from distant tribes. Although the journey was extremely dangerous, their profits were high as well.\u201cWu, let\u2019s go back as soon as possible. I heard it hasn\u2019t been peaceful around here lately. The great wasteland\u2019s Wood Clan keeps sending troops out. Furthermore, I heard rumors that an Archaic Descendant from the heart of the mountains just stopped over here. It will definitely start showing off its power and begin its intimidation. It will most likely come to Rushing Cloud Town and create a ruckus.\u201dThe little guy carefully overheard. By sitting on by himself on his mount, he was naturally rather conspicuous, however, no one gave him a hard time along the journey. Any child who traveled alone with blood all over his body was certainly not a simple figure. In reality, these people frequently went into the ancient forests; they\u2019ve experienced a lot and seen a lot. They assumed that this was most likely the disciple of a large clan who came out to train.\u201cYiya, not good. It looks like there\u2019s a little beast flood. It couldn\u2019t have been that the Archaic Descendant decided to show its might early, right?\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s most likely an ordinary beast king, as there aren\u2019t that many groups of beasts. However, let\u2019s still leave quickly!\u201dAlong the journey, they could already see Rushing Cloud Town. The city walls were majestic, and it was as if a mountain range obstructed in front. It was constructed out of diamond rocks, and so its entirety was pitch black like metal as it emitted a terrifying luster.In front of the city was a group of vicious birds and fierce beasts, and they formed a pitch black expanse. They did not avoid the city, and directly displayed their might. Their howls shook the sky, and they wanted to siege this city, making everyone tremble.\u201cMove away quickly. Hopefully, our Great Guardian Spirit can behead these vicious beasts and wipe them clean!\u201dThe group of people rapidly escaped into the distance. They could not enter the city during this time, since they were afraid of attracting the attention of these beasts and causing a catastrophe.In the city, there was a mountain of earth close to the city wall. A plant that was four to five zhang tall grew on top, and it was clearly visible from even outside the city. Its entire body was dark green, and it had huge palm-like leaves.This was the Guardian Spirit of Rushing Cloud Town, a plant whose name even the locals did not know of; it was usually referred to as Great Guardian Spirit or Great Rushing Cloud.It released waves of fragrance from each of its three huge, and strange flowers extended from between its huge palm-like leaves. Each flower was as large as a millstone, and they all had gorgeous petals that flickered with multi-colored light. One of them was curled up in scarlet light, another was as pure white as jade, and the last was shrouded in purple mist.The beast herd had obviously seen the people outside the city, and a group immediately rushed out while producing thunderous roars.\u201cGreat Guardian Spirit! Save us!\u201d This group of people shouted loudly.The little guy had already finished his battle preparations; however at that moment, there was a flash of scarlet light, and one of the flowers belonging to the plant on top of that mountain blossomed with a multi-colored scarlet light. Its petals unfolded, dispersing a shocking ripple.Chi.A streak of scarlet light shot out before turning to attack towards that region of beasts. Suddenly, the group of ten vicious birds and fierce beasts that rushed out went into disarray, and constantly howled as their blood spilled into the air, causing heavy casualties to the beast herd.The little guy had a surprised expression on his face, and shockingly discovered this so-called scarlet light was actually a flying sword that was scarlet all over; it sparkled like a fiery jade.\u201cA flower with a flying sword inside?\u201dAfter a short while, those ten fierce beasts and birds all fell into a pool of blood. They either had their heads chopped off or had their bodies cut in in half. It was extremely tyrannical.\u201cIt\u2019s so much more powerful that the Wolf Village\u2019s Legendary Wolf. If it was compared to Aunt Green Scaled Eagle before she ate the Suan Ni meat, she would definitely be inferior as well,\u201d said the little guy lightly. That scarlet light was too quick and violent. In just a short period of effort, it executed all of those vicious creatures.After a flash of splendor, the scarlet sword flew back into the city.The faces of all those businessmen who collected beast skins and spirit medicines became pale. After they regained their composure, they charged toward Rushing Cloud City to kowtow and show their gratitude.\u201cYa, so it turns out it is its stamen which actually contained many identical flying swords,\u201d said the little guy in amazement. That flying sword was only a stamen that was shaped like a sword, and it sheathed itself back into the flower petal. After the dazzling splendor circulated a bit, its petals closed again.\u201cGreat Rushing Cloud has been protecting this town for hundreds of years, ever since it was a town of less than 1000 to the city that has a population surpassing 80000 people today. Its contributions are simply astronomical!\u201d\u201cGreat Rushing Cloud\u2019s powers is enough to protect a huge city, and it is not in any way inferior to those Guardian Spirits of huge cities. Only, it never had the desire of leaving.\u201dThese people were all discussing among themselves. After the little guy heard this, he was amazed at how extremely powerful that plant was.\u201cThis Guardian Spirit is very extraordinary.\u201d Within the city, a fat middle-aged man talked to himself. His face could not be considered white, while his eyes flickered radiantly.\u201cIt is extremely powerful, and this kind of Guardian Spirit is very rare as well. If master showed his face to invite it, perhaps this Guardian Spirit could become a member of my Rain Clan.\u201dThe fat middle aged man shook his head and said, \u201cWhatever, it\u2019s bad for this stuff to spread, and actual matters are more important anyway. We don\u2019t know whether or not young lady Xia Youyu has returned. I\u2019m here to seek that talisman.\u201dZhang = 3.3 metersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They hesitated in the air, but they did immediately retreat after seeing species that were similar to them being killed off.On top of the mountain within the city, the Guardian Spirit stood four to five zhang tall. Its entire body was dark green, and three millstone-sized flowers with rose-like appearances had multi-colored light circulating about it. It was extremely splendid, and waves of fragrant odor was released from it.The longer the Guardian Spirit acted passively and did not attack, the more the unrest within the beast herd outside grew. They were afraid of this Guardian Spirit that had taken root here for so many years, and although they didn\u2019t cower in retreat, they didn\u2019t dare act at this moment.Suddenly, a long bird cry echoed throughout. It was like the sound of thunder, shaking forest until leaves scattered in chaos. An enormous black figure appeared in midair as a 50 to 60 meter long vicious bird flew across the sky. Dark light flickered all over its bird body as its essence energy surged forth. Its silver eyes were as sharp as bristles of electricity, and with its flickering symbols, its oppressive aura began cover the earth.\u201cYa, the leader of the vicious bird and beast group showed up! It\u2019s indeed a vicious bird. What a terrifying ripple of energy!\u201d Everyone was startled.This time, the beast flood actually had such a powerful vicious bird leading them. After its whistle, all the various land beasts began to initiate their attacks. With its terrifying display of power, none of them dared to disobey its order.Qiang!Within the city on the mountain of earth, that Guardian Spirit once again blossomed with a multi-colored scarlet light. That red flower went into full bloom, and an incomparable sharp scarlet lightning shot across the skyPu, pu\u2026The few vicious beasts who were leading the group suddenly fell after being hit by the flying scarlet sword. Their heads all began to drip with bright red blood as they were hacked open triggering fear and chaos amongst them.This was obviously just a plant, but it was able to use such a tyrannical scarlet sword. This sharp sword-shaped stamen could be called a world-shocking weapon that could overcome any obstacles. The attacks of the fierce beasts and birds began to slow down.With this kind of Guardian Spirit keeping watch, it could resist an army of thousands. An ordinary beast cloud was simply unable to shake Rushing Cloud City\u2019s foundation, making this place safe from any attacks.In the sky, that enormous fifty to sixty meter long vicious bird began to cry out. Pitch black light began to flicker, and its body began to emit waves of divine symbols. Soon after, it opened its mouth, spitting down a large area of flames towards that plant. It personally made its move; otherwise, the beast flood would be defeated.The scarlet sword flew back, and the dark green plant trembled. Its entire body began to shine, and a dark green mist surged forth into the sky in order to meet that large area of flames. After some chi la chi la sounds, the fire began to quickly diminish.The black vicious bird in the sky had a pair of silver eyes that burned with rays of light. They shot out streaks of light beams as if they were enormous silver arrows. They continuously extended over a dozen meters, as they powerfully shot down.Bo, Bo\u2026Within the city, the plant\u2019s dark green leaves began to tremble. Its flowers that were as large as millstones simultaneously blossomed. Scarlet, white, and purple; three kinds of light bursted forth. Mists of light surged, and it was auspicious and dazzling as it released a shocking wave.Scarlet light flickered, and the sound of swords was deafening. That scarlet sword was the first one to rush out into the sky, and it drew out an arc of brilliant red light, creating a scenery that resembled the sunset glow. After that, a pure white radiance flashed, and the white jade sword charged into the heavens. Lastly, a dense purple mist rose, and a purple sword released a long cy.The three flying swords simultaneously rose from the ground like a comet streaking across the skies. They swayed their long tails as they illuminated the entire horizon. Its light was astonishing as it linked the heavens and the earth.That vicious bird spiraled into the sky like a black cloud. The vicious might was terrifying. Within its silver eyes, streaks of silver light beams shot out one after another. In the end, however, they were still all destroyed.The sounds of the three swords were ear-splitting as their cries stirred the heavens. Their symbols proliferated, and in the end, the remnant flame was once again ignited, chopping towards the front of the vicious bird.The vicious bird flapped its wings, and it tried its best to withstand it. Bright symbols erupted from that area, and the bird met the swords head on.Following those resonating sounds, there was a final pu sound, and the enormous vicious bird\u2019s body was split open. Large chunks of blood rained from the sky as the huge bird\u2019s head was chopped off before falling onto the ground.The beast flood collapsed on the spot. Their leader was defeated, and as a result, they scattered and fled everywhere towards the distant mountain ranges.\u201cKill!\u201dThe city walls were opened wide, and a group of experts rushed out as they chased after their buttocks to kill them. A bunch of arrows were shot into the sky at a 45 degree angle, landing in the middle of those vicious birds and fierce beasts. Blood instantly splashed out, and one corpse after another was left behind.In the distance, the little guy who witness that battle a moment ago could not help but feel a bit of unrest. Guardian Spirits were truly odd in all different ways. There were all kinds of species, and all of them were extremely powerful.It was just a plant with three flowers as large as millstones, yet it unexpectedly carried sword-like stamens; it was extremely shocking.This battle moved little Shi Hao quite a bit, and he muttered, \u201cSymbols could actually be utilized like this! To carry a sharp weapon inside itself to attack and conquer everything in path.\u201dHe was pondering over whether or not to try an imitate what he saw, and condense a sharp weapon out of symbols.After that rather fat middle-aged man witnessed that battle from within the city, he muttered to himself, \u201cThis Guardian Spirit is truly not simple, and actually grew a few flying swords. Its achievements in the future is simply immeasurable.\u201dThe three swords were all rare, priceless precious artifacts that tempted his heart, but he knew no matter how powerful the Rain Clan was, there were some things one just could not obtain.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. What kind of news came from that worn out manor?\u201d After the middle-aged man returned to his senses, he asked the area supervisor by his side.\u201cNothing. After that couple left, they never returned,\u201d responded the supervisor. He was already forty years old, and stayed by the western border all year round. Ordinarily, his power and influence was not small, but now he had to once again lower his head and bend down like in the past.\u201cShi Ziling is a terrifying person. The clan is not at ease and hopes that he will not appear again. Pay more attention to it, and report any news immediately.\u201d An evil expression appeared on that middle age man\u2019s face.\u201cYes, as long as there is wind blowing and grass swaying, the news will immediately be reported.\u201d The supervisor\u00a0had a faithful and devoted appearance. He lived in this uncivilized land long enough, and wanted to return to the empire.\u201cThat\u2019s right, is that child still alive?\u201d That expressionless and rather fat middle-aged man absent-mindedly asked.The supervisor\u00a0hastily responded, \u201cHis body is very weak so he can\u2019t live for too long.\u201dThe middle aged man let out an oh sound, and did not express any more opinions.The supervisor\u2019s face suddenly paled and added, \u201cThose old freaks all passed away, and the last remaining one can\u2019t live for much longer. That evil bastard can\u2019t live for much longer either.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be confused. No matter how worn out that place is, it still has an abnormal importance. If something unexpected occurs\u2026 Hmph!\u201d The middle aged man warned.\u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry. That child might be careless\u00a0and fall into a well, go missing in a mountain, attacked and killed by a vicious bird, or accidentally killed without any trace of loopholes.\u201cStop making\u00a0assumptions!\u201d The middle aged man ruthlessly stared at him with one eye.\u201cYes!\u201d The supervisor hastily bent over and did dare to make any other comments.When the middle-aged man left to rest. The supervisor\u00a0immediately straightened his body and sat on his leaning chair. He faced the door with a powerful, imposing and rather dignified look. \u201cLet them in!\u201dOutside of Rushing Cloud City, businessmen who went through the dense forest to collect beast skins and spirit medicines from the ancient tribes appeared. They successively returned to the city through the city gates.The little guy watched for a bit from afar, and soon after, he urged his unicorn to quickly speed into the distance. He did not enter the city in fear of some unforeseen events occurring, as there were interrogators at the city gates.The unicorn rapidly traveled. He made plans to take a detour around this region, and travel straight towards Stone Clan\u2019s second ancestral land.Incredibly dangerous terrain lined the towering mountains and lofty ridges, and this detour actually added an extra thousand li. At first, there were steep cliffs that blocked the road, but soon after, there were swamps that took up the entire area.However, he had already traveled over 300,000 li, so he did not mind the 1000 li detour. He had finally reached Stone Country\u2019s borders without a hitch, and he quickly rushed toward the ruined ancestral land.At noon, he finally arrived at his destination. The sun was large, and emitted dense rays of sunshine. However, that ruined manor seemed lethargic and heavy, and many buildings had already collapsed.The little guy did not approach that area immediately. He got off of his unicorn from quite a distance away, and ran into the forest by himself while only bringing Hairy Ball to observe. He had no choice but to be careful, as Stone Clan was extremely enormous. If one of their men were guarding this place\u00a0while waiting\u00a0him to fall into their trap, then it would inevitably lead to an extremely situation that would only lead to death.In the following few days, little Shi Hao still did not make any indiscriminate actions. He roamed about nearby, and carefully examined many things within his surroundings.Within the vicinity, there were four villages and a single town, and within this vast but sparsely populated western boundary, this was naturally rather unusual. When traveling through the mountain ranges and crossing the ridges, one would only see a single village under normal circumstances.The initial purpose of these villages were simply to supply the ancestral land. In the end, however, they ended up merging together.This was a land of exile, but normal people could not come in either. Only well known people from within the Stone Clan who\u00a0committed the greatest of crimes were exiled here.\u201cAi, it\u2019s getting more and more lifeless. Those old freaks are all dying off one after another. What\u2019s going to happen to that pitiful child? Such evil sins\u2026\u201d An elder drove a beast chariot and left the shabby manor. He was here to deliver fruits and wild prey for them to eat.Although the manor had some servants, this place still seemed rather cold and cheerless. It was like an abandoned land, desolate and withered.\u201cGrandpa Hai, you have to bring Big Black over next time so it can play with me.\u201d In the middle of the shabby manor, a weak child sat on a stone step while waving his hand with all of his strength. He was talking while coughing, and had a pale and small face.\u201cOkay, when Big Black gives birth to that nest of tigerlings, I\u2019ll bring them immediately and let them play with you.\u201d The elder who drove the beast chariot far away gently said, \u201cTruly a pitiable child. With no relatives or playmates, he has been protected in this old graveyard of a manor. His childhood has been too dull.\u201dOnly when that elder\u2019s beast chariot traveled far away did that child reluctantly stand up. His feet seemed rather limp, and he held the wall as he slowly walked towards the manor.In the distance, the little guy stood within a forest and foolishly saw everything. His eyes were tearing up as he muttered\u00a0to himself, \u201cIs that the other me who has been my replacement to be lonely and unhappy here? His body is so weak and his foot is broken. Was it injured by other people?\u201dThe little guy rubbed that talisman in his bosom that resembled a piece of gold and gently said, \u201cI have to deliver you to the Heaven Mending Pavilion. No matter how far it is, I will accompany you there.\u201d\u201cYoung master, the last ancestor is about to pass away as well. He does not have many days left. Your days in the future will be difficult,\u201d said a servant at the door\u00a0as he sat there casually. No matter how you looked at it, his expression did not carry an ounce of respect, and only contained ridicule.\u201cYou are speaking nonsense. Grandpa ancestor will not die!\u201d The pale faced child had tears in his large eyes as he refuted loudly while constantly coughing.\u201cThen just wait and see.\u201d That servant did not seem to mind.Another servant said, \u201cI heard that young master is not the son of that Shi Ziling. Your real identity is actually the descendant of a relative of that old freak who passed away, and you are actually just here as a replacement.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. If you are actually Shi Ziling\u2019s son, you would be in an even more precarious situation.\u201d The servant who sat there arrogantly nodded as he faced the young master. He did not get up from start to finish, and lacked any sign of respect.The little guy saw everything from the distant forest and clenched his fists tightly. During these past few days, he gained a rough understanding of the situation. A portion of the servants within this ruined cage-like manor had long been bribed by outside influences. They were destroying the area from the inside out, and after a few of the old ancestors passed away, some of them became absolutely unrestrained.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They carelessly said that the ancestor was going to die as they took joy in the poor child\u2019s misfortune.\u201cYou are not permitted to talk nonsense!\u201d The pale faced child with a weak body and tears within his eyes was heartbroken and desperate.He truly feared that his ancestral grandpa would pass away, and he could not bear to part with that kind of affection. These servants were absolutely vile too, so how would he be able to live in the future?\u201cYoung master, living sickly like this is actually quite tormenting. In my eyes, after that old man passes away too, you should\u2026what\u2019s that\u2026\u201d The man in the gate room forcefully laughed and didn\u2019t say it out loud, since it was excessively blatant.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, don\u2019t say any more. It\u2019s going to happen sooner or later. Looking at his appearance, he can\u2019t live for much longer. He will die prematurely for sure.\u201d Another servant at the side quietly said with a sneer.\u201cYou\u2019re so vile. I will not excuse you!\u201d The child had teary eyes. He leaned against the wall and limped towards the inside.He was extremely lonely. In this huge manor, he did not have a single relative or playmate. He only had this deserted and shabby building whose windows creaked after a wind blew past.This child had always wanted to walk inside. He arrived at a spacious courtyard and pushed open a maple door whose paint had fallen off long time ago. He gently said, \u201cGrandfather.\u201dOn top of that ancient bed laid a old and gray-haired elder whose face was like golden paper. His aura was like a stream, and his eyes were very bleak ever since they had lost their all-powerful radiance from his former years.\u201cChild\u2026if I die, the only one who would not be at ease is you.\u201d The elder raised his arm with great difficulty and reached out. He was struggling, and needed several tries to touch that child\u2019s hand.\u201cGrandfather, you won\u2019t die.\u201d The child wept.\u201cChild\u2026 don\u2019t cry.\u201d The elder used his rough hands to gently stroke his pale face. His muddy old eyes shed a few tears, and he was very reluctant to go.\u201cGrandfather!\u201d The child wept loudly. He was very helpless as he laid by the bedside and grabbed the elder\u2019s hand with all his might without any intention of letting go.The elder used his large rough hands to pull the little hands toward him. He looked left and right with great affection, but his eyes were dark. He wanted to open his mouth and say something, but his chest rose and fell, as there were some things that could not be said.\u201cGrandfather, you cannot abandon me. What do I do when I\u2019m by myself?\u201d The child was distressed as he shook that elder\u2019s arm.During the past few years, the elders all passed away one after the other, causing him to be incredibly heartbroken. There was only one elder remaining who was his most intimate person, but he was about to die as well which terrified his him.\u201cChild\u2026\u201d The elder opened his mouth, but all he could form out of it was a single word; nothing else came out. His eyes had lost all of its luster, and he could only pant heavily now.Outside the gate, the little guy\u2019s large eyes were red all over. He soundlessly and breathlessly entered the manor. Through his few days of surveillance, he confirmed there were no experts and came here.He pushed the gate open and walked inside. He wiped away his tears and gazed toward the elder on the bed and emotionally said, \u201cGrandfather.\u201d\u201cYa, you\u2026\u201d That pale faced child was scared backwards.The elder on the bed became suspicious. On his deathbed, he unexpectedly saw a child that he had never seen before. Being called by that, he perplexedly looked toward him.He was once an all-powerful expert, yet he could not fight against the passage of time. After he reached his twilight years, his condition became bleak.\u201cGrandfather, I am that child back then. I\u2019m here to see you!\u201d \u00a0The little guy chokingly sobbed. Seeing the past through the Willow Deity, he knew that the elders who were exiled here treated their family very nicely. The child on the side was one they brought in as a substitute.After hearing these words, the elder on the bed ferociously widened his eyes. Those originally dark eyes suddenly emitted a threatening splendor as he spoke in a trembling voice, \u201cYou\u2026 are actually him?\u201dHe unexpectedly talked in a rushed voice and threatening gaze.\u201cThat\u2019s right grandfather. I\u2019m here to see you.\u201d The little guy grabbed his hand while chokingly sobbed. He did not make it in time to see the other elders off.\u201cYour injuries\u2026\u201d The elder panted heavily. He asked with an urgent voice, but these were the only words he was able to muster out.\u201cMy injuries have healed. I\u2019ve made it through.\u201d The little guy said because he knew this was the best thing he wanted to hear. Then he lightly said again, \u201cA swing of my arm contains a divine strength of 108,000 jin.\u201dHe told things honestly. As expected, after the elder heard it, he astonishingly widened his eyes and his lips constantly opened and closed. He pulled one of his little arms as if he wanted to confirm something.\u201d\u201cYes, just a single arm\u2019s strength!\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes were tearful and he nodded with all his strength.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d At the very last moment, the elder was like the final radiance of the setting sun and unexpectedly released a huge laughter. His cloudy tears tumbled down and his face was brimming with happiness at this pleasant surprise. This gave him reassurance, and he did not have a single shred of regret left.But the little guy continued to weep because he knew the elder depleted the last bit of his essence energy, and even holy medicine was unable to save him.This elder was the brother of Shi Hao\u2019s grandfather. From a bloodline\u2019s perspective, they were really closely related, so he treated him very nicely unlike those groups of indifferent people from the empire.\u201cGrandfather\u2026\u201dThe child at the side cried loudlyThe elder\u2019s eyes did not have a single trace of radiance left, and used the last bit of his strength to grab that child\u2019s hand before looking towards little Shi Hao. He opened his mouth a bit with the intention of putting that little hand on his hand, but he was out of strength.The little guy wept and extended his hand and grabbed that little hand before clenching it tightly. Then he put them together on that elder\u2019s rough big hands and lightly said, \u201cGrandfather, don\u2019t worry. I will take care of him well!\u201dA final cloudy tear tumbled down from that elder\u2019s tear and he stopped moving. His face had a smile on it, as if he received gratification, however, it also contained a look of satisfaction as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.He was happy and free, as all of his regrets were resolved. He passed away just like that, and shut his eyes.\u201cGrandfather!\u201d the child at the side wept loudly and instantly threw himself over the body of the elder. His heart was split, and his lungs cracked as he heartbrokenly grieved. Clusters of tears bunched up and tumbled downThe little guy shed tears as well. Finally, he pulled this child up and quietly gave him a warning before leaving.Two days later, the elder was buried, and that child wept in front of his grave in great suffering. The group of servants could not pull him away no matter how hard they tried, and even fainted several times.Finally, he was carried away by two faithful old servants.The little guy hid in the forest and also wiped away his tears as he silently choked with emotions. He looked from afar since he had no way of appearing or approaching.He only came to the grave after all the people had left. He quietly muttered there and carefully prayed.\u201cYoung master, your foot is always limping, walk slower and be careful of falling down.\u201d It was still at that gate room where those two servants became even more unrestrained and loudly made fun of him. The few elders had all died, so what kind of trouble could this little pitiful child make? The foreigners always wanted to kill him, and it looks like it will not be long now.\u201cYou people\u2026\u201d The child was angry, and his little face was pale as he glared at them with his thoroughly red eyeballs.\u201cYou two are too disgraceful. This is the young master, how can you speak like this?!\u201d Two old servants shouted.\u201cMeddle more in other people\u2019s business old men. This shabby place is a prison, how could it have a master? Ordinarily calling him that is just sticking some gold on his face.\u201d The two servants in the gate room turned hostile.The two old servants trembled all over. They pull that child\u2019s hands and furiously left.During the evening in that child\u2019s room, the little guy appeared and lightly said, \u201cWhat do you wish for right now?\u201d\u201cI want to see Big Black right now what the little tiger she gave birth to,\u201d the child wept and said. Big Black was that tiger raised by elder Hai who was normally in charge of delivering food for them. Usually, he lacked a playmate so he was very lonely. Each time that grandpa Hai came and delivered food for them, he could only play with Big Black for a while.The little guy\u2019s heart was sad. He was a kind-hearted child, but he also encountered such a series of torment. He was able to sympathize with the pain the child in front of him suffered.\u201cDo you not want to punish those two servants in the gate room?\u201d the little guy asked\u201cI want to, but I do not want to make a big deal out of it.\u201d This child\u2019s eyes were thoroughly red as a said that. Those two were very harsh, and when the elders began to start dying, they did a great deal of misdeeds within the manor.Zhizhi! Hairy Ball shrieked. It also saw everything with its eyes and was extremely angry. What it meant was, \u201cThey must be severely punished!\u201d\u201cHairy Ball, you do it,\u201d the little guy said. He still had other things to do, like finding out who bribed those servants. Although he had some guesses, he still wanted to confirm his suspicions and take some action, because those other people were intolerable bullies.\u201cDon\u2019t cry anymore. Just forget everything that is here. In the future, I\u2019ll bring you to a place called Heaven Mending Pavilion and no one will dare to bully you again,\u201d the little guy consoled.Aooo\u2026During midnight, a vicious beast flew over and descended outside the manor. This was a three zhang tall Unicorn Man Bear that was light gold all over. A golden horn grew out of its head, and a pair of wings grew from its back, enabling flight.This kind of creature could utilize symbols, but they could not create ancient precious bones like that of a unicorn. They had a certain amount of power, but they were inferior to genuinely powerful vicious beasts.A squishy and plump little fist sized beast sat on its head and shined in golden light. After arriving here, it made a whoosh sound and disappeared without a trace. That was precisely Hairy Ball. Not even the little guy could have thought that it went out and tamed this kind of vicious beast.Peng.The golden Man Bear swatted forward with its claws and immediately smashed open the gate. The two dreamers awoke from their dreams, and after seeing such a ferocious predator coming straight towards them, the two limped out weakly as they fearfully screamed.The Man Bear sat with its buttocks, and after a few kacha sounds, the sound of the two people\u2019s bones being broken echoed through. Only their upper bodies were exposed, and their lowered bodies had already been turned into mutilated flesh.\u201cSave us!\u201dAt this time of the night, this kind of mournful scream echoed especially far. The two people were so scared that their bladders burst as they fearfully cried.The people within the manor were startled and many people held a weapon and came over. When they arrived in the vicinity, they were all struck with sudden surprise.The golden Man Beat was currently creating kacha kacha sounds as he tore off those two\u2019s legs apart to eat them. Blood sprinkled everywhere, and ghostly white bones were exposed. It was extremely terrifying.After seeing these people rush over, the Man Bear got up and patted its big bloody claws. Then with a flap of its wings, it directly disappeared into the night sky.\u201cAh, save us!\u201d The two screamed wretchedly.Everyone knew that these two people were finished, as they lost both their legs. In this cruel western border, even if they could survive, they were destined to live in extreme tragedy.\u201cServes you right! I told you guys not to do bad stuff everyday!\u201d\u201cRevenge, God has grown some eyes!\u201dAbsolutely no one sympathized with them, as it was obvious how disastrous they carried themselves.\u201cHairy Ball, you\u2019re truly\u2026bad enough.\u201d After the little guy saw this scene, he stared at that golden Zhuyan with amazement. He did not imagine that it would command a Man Bear to do this kind of thing. It did not kill those two, but what it did was more cruel than killing them.Hairy Ball waved its little golden claw. What it meant was, \u201cThis is just a little matter, you have to treat bad people like this.\u201d\u201cLittle big brother, I heard grandpa say that the bribed people in the manor were just bridge jumping clowns. Only the people outside are strong with terrifyingly powerful peak level experts among them,\u201d the pale child at the side said.\u201cDon\u2019t fear. I have a way to deal with them.\u201d The little guy clenched his little fists tightly. He had a few guess, but he did not know whether it was Shi Yi\u2019s bloodline or other people. He was sad and angry, and decided to wage a war here.\u201cHowever, they are truly hard to deal with since we are still small,\u201d said the child at the side timidly.\u201cEven when dealing with the most terrifying fierce beast, you do not have have to fight with your life on the line. Oh, I forgot, I have always battled with vicious birds and fierce beasts, and have gotten used to saying stuff like this.\u201d The little guy scratched his head in embarrassment then continued to say, \u201cI have ways. Not a single one of them can escape. No matter how powerful they are, as long as they live in the western border, they will meet calamity and suffer punishment!\u201dPoop named it this and kindly suggested that it remain like soPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His name was Yu Meng, and his face was expressionless as terrifying symbols circulated within his eyes. He was the number one expert of the Rain Clan.This time, he accepted orders from the clan elder to inspect the western border. This area was part of the clan\u2019s property, and there were various uncommon metal ores mines, as well as an various precious birds and strange beasts.\u201cHas young lady Youyu appeared?\u201d Yu Meng stood atop an arched bridge in a garden, and he was currently looking towards a group of purple scaled fish in the river while asking the official at his side. While carrying out the inspection, he also had to request a talisman from \u00a0a Heaven Mending Pavilion emissary for the sake of his clan\u2019s extraordinary genius.The Clan Elder gave much of his affection towards that talent, so he did not want to make any slip ups. The sooner he could obtain the talisman and leave, the better.The supervisor was very respectful and replied, \u201cOur scout have continuously been searching, however, we have yet to see young lady Xia return. I\u2019ll report to you as soon as there is any information.\u201d\u201cTruly unsatisfactory. Clan Elder as assigned me the task of finding out information about Shi Ziling, but absolutely nothing regarding the situation has turned up. In addition, I need to find a talisman, yet the person can\u2019t even be reached!\u201d Yu Meng was unpleased. He turned around and walked off the stone arched bridge and into a pavilion before sitting down.The supervisor\u2019s face turned pale and hurried followed behind. He bowed down, saluted and said, \u201cSir, forgive me!\u201dSoon after, the supervisor returned to a palace hall and sat on a leaning chair. He rubbed his temples and shouted with an imposing voice, \u201cServants!\u201dSuddenly, a group of people quickly walked in. These were all experts who had extremely powerful strength.\u201cSo many years have passed. I assigned you people to search for news regarding Shi Ziling, yet you fools couldn\u2019t even find a trace of him. Utter trash!\u201d The supervisor roared like an angry lion, and his temperament was much different than his previous fawning behavior just a while ago. He was currently acting incredibly ferocious and powerful.The group of people suddenly felt a wave of coldness. They were well aware that not only was this supervisor vicious, he was also an expert with a profound cultivation. In this Rushing Cloud City, he was definitely an upper level figure.The supervisor\u2019s face was gloomy as he said, \u201cAlso, those old monsters from that shabby manor all died. Is that child still alive?\u201d\u201cSir, we found out a long time ago that the child there is most likely a substitute. It\u2019s impossible for him to be that Shi Hao from back then.\u201d A person courageously responded.\u201cIdiot!\u201d The supervisor became furious. He slapped down with all his strength, immediate destroying the wooden table in front of him. Furthermore, under the surge of his aura, the metallic floor shook, disintegrating and sinking the metallic floor down by a foot. It was possible to imagine just how terrifying his cultivation was.\u201cEven if he is a fake, we still have to think of a way to kill him. What kind of clan is the Rain Clan? They are an ancient and glorious clan with an ancient history that is even older than Stone Country. They care about fact the most, and letting that little child live is simly a humiliation for them!\u201d roared the supervisor.The people below immediately revealed their fear, and could not help but take a step back. That gloomy man above them howled and shook their eardrums until they were in extreme pain.\u201cSir, don\u2019t worry. Those old monsters has already died. Who can still protect him? There will be news about it soon.\u201dThe group of people hastily declared.\u201cI\u2019m warning you guys, don\u2019t leave any holes in your plan. Otherwise, I\u2019ll pull your muscles out and strip your skin off. If an accident happens, none of you will live!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll make the proper arrangements. We could let a poisonous bug bite him to death, let a beast rush in from the mountains, scare him into a slow death, or even invite in a few fierce disciples. They wouldn\u2019t act against him, but they could\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, just leave. I only look for results.\u201d The supervisor waved his hand and sent the people off to make their moves.The shabby manor was intensely cold. As the wind blew past, all kinds of old doors began to creak. During the night, they sounded like the weeping of ghosts.Those few elders had all passed away, and for the past few decades, there haven\u2019t been any new \u2018criminals\u2019 exile here as punishment. This place was incredibly ghastly, and it lacked the presence of humans.When night arrived, not even the servants dared to go out and stroll around the manor.\u201cYour name is\u2026\u201d The little guy scratched his head since they had the same name.\u201cEver since I was young, they all called me Shi Hao,\u201d said the child\u00a0gently\u00a0as he lowered his head with sadness. Those elders had all died, so he felt very lonely now.\u201cHow about you use that name and I\u2019ll change mine,\u201d said the little guy. This child received so much bitter pain on his behalf, so he did not want to take back the name that he always used as well.\u201cNo need, it\u2019s fine if I just change mine. This name always stirs my memories. I want to forget everything,\u201d the child at the side said.After thinking for a long while, he made a new name for himself called Shi Qingfeng. He wished that he could be as free as the wind in the future, and be freed from this prison.The two children\u2019s eyes were all very bright. They looked at each other and started laughing.\u201cI want to see Big Black,\u201d little Qingfeng said. \u00a0He had a bit of reluctance and reminiscence in his eyes, and wished to leave and see his best friend.During these many years, he was truly lonely since he did not have any playmates similar to his age. Without any friends, only that black tiger could make him laugh. He was very pitiful.\u201cOkay!\u201dAfter dawn and before even they had left, sounds began to echo from the gate. A resonant voice transmitted through and said, \u201cChild, where are you? Uncle is here to take you away from this damn place and help you escape from these slaves\u2019 bullying.\u201dA middle-aged man entered the manor. He had a tall stature with a dragon beard across his face and was very boorish. The little guy got up and quickly hid with the intention of avoiding being seen.\u201cYa, It\u2019s Uncle Hai!\u201d little Qingfeng was joyful.Uncle Hai was the son of Grandpa Hai, and this family always treated him nicely. After those elders passed away one after the other, Grandpa Hai and his son discussed it together, and they decided in the end to take in and raise this pitiful child.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be too good to have you leave all of a sudden.\u201d A servant stood blocked his way.\u201cNow very good my ass. If this child continues to live here, he would definitely not live for more than three months. That leg of his is already so crippled, do you guys not know that? Just when that elder fell into terminal illness, a rare and poisonous flood dragon scuttled through and bit the bottom of his foot\u2026\u201d Uncle Hai was unsatisfied as his steel-like dragon whiskers trembled.\u201cUncle Hai, I\u2019ll go with you to see Big Black.\u201d Little Qingfeng ran over.They were currently at a village that was normally in charge of delivering prey, vegetables or fruits to the Stone Clan\u2019s second ancestral land. They were not large, and only had 100 or so members.Hou\u2026 A large voice transmitted through, and a huge black tiger appeared at the entrance of the village. It was enormously huge at roughly three zhang tall and was six to seven zhang long. It rapidly rushed over, and behind it were four little tiger cubs who were all charmingly naive as they all ran over together.\u201cBig Black\u2026\u201d Little Qingfeng rapidly threw himself over while brimming with joy.The little guy stared blankly from the distant mountain. This tiger was not simple, as it had an exuberant amount of blood essence and mysterious symbols inside its body; it was a fierce beast.In the distance, a cold and detached young man saw this. \u201cDamn it, the father and son of the Hai family unexpectedly took him in. This father and son duo are both powerful experts who lived here in seclusion, and all the villagers around here trust him.\u201dOn that night, the fierce beasts within the mountain began to roar. Suddenly over ten enormous black figures went mad and broke into the village to massacre the entire place.Aooo..\u201cAiya, not good! Fierce beasts are here to take our lives. Quickly run for your lives!\u201d The villagers were terrified.Pu, Pu!\u2026The sounds of bowstrings trembling echoed within the darkness. A few shining arrows with symbols on them flew out towards those few enormous black figures. The beast howls stopped immediately, and they all fell to the ground dead.Soon after, the villagers all calmed down.\u201cGrandfather Hai, you are truly lively despite being old, and actually shot down those tiger-like vicious beasts.\u201d The villagers sincerely thanked him.The little guy stood far away within the forest and nodded. The father and son of the Hai family were indeed powerful experts who lived in seclusion. They were unusually skilled, and they were rather extraordinary.\u201cThis old thing can shoot arrows with symbols\u00a0and even has a profound skill. He shouldn\u2019t be an otherworldly expert right?\u201d In the distance, a group of people frowns as they exposed their killing intent.During the next few days, poisonous bugs and fierce birds appeared from time to time to surround the village. Although they were all killed by the father and son of the Hai family, the villagers were still trembling with fear.\u201cSuch vile humans, so this is them pressuring us to hand over the child. If I really return him back, I can guarantee he will not live for another two months.\u201d Uncle Hai was furious.\u201cLet it be. We stayed here long enough, so we should switch to another place while bringing this child with us. Of course, before we leave, I\u2019ll make preparations to slaughter them,\u201d Grandfather Hai coldly said.During the evening when more fierce beasts came to attack, two figures began to move out. With speeds as fast as specters, they streaked across the sky into the distance.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dWretched screamed sounded in succession. Not only were the fierce beasts exterminated, there were even people who died. The experts that the supervisor sent were all extraordinarily powerful individuals who cultivated with the Bone Text. Otherwise, if they were too ordinary, how could they have been in charge of finding news regarding the tracks of Shi Ziling? However, it was still not enough. The twenty people were all killed without a single one escaping.\u201cSo powerful!\u201d The little guy who was in the forest was shocked.Since he grew up within the mountains his entire life while killing vicious birds and fierce beasts, he naturally understood how to conceal his own aura and avoid being discovered.Within Rushing Cloud City, after the supervisor received the news, his eyes became gloomy. Twenty experts dying within a single night was definitely not something an ordinary person was capable of.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that I have to personally go?!\u201d He jumped on his legs and stood up. He released a powerful aura and cracked the walls of the entire room.After daybreak, Yu Meng stood up within his majestic manor and strolled around the garden. He indifferently asked, \u201cI heard you lost some manpower?\u201dThe supervisor immediately stooped down and did not dare to look straight as he said, \u201cRight, there was unexpectedly some extremely powerful experts hidden. I\u2019m prepared to personally take action and kill them.\u201dYu Meng cold and indistinctly said, \u201cExperts eh, I like it. I have been raising a vicious beast lately and need the blood of experts. Take my people with you and capture that father and son pair for me. I suspect they may be of some interest.\u201dThe supervisor was startled then exulted. If the important members of the Rain Clan took action, who would be be able to live? Even though that father and son duo were hidden experts, they would still meet a tragic end.He knew that things had been unfavorable for Yu Meng recently, and so felt a wave of anger within his heart. It was about to erupt, perhaps even creating some terrifying disturbances for the western border.Within the village, little Qingfeng gratefully said, \u201cGrandpa Hai, It\u2019s impossible for me to leave with you. I have to go with little elder brother, and he told me that there are ways to heal my foot. You guys leave quickly, otherwise, those bad people will not give up.In the end, they met within the dense forest and little Shi Hao showed himself.\u201cThank you grandpa Hai, Uncle Hai. You have to leave this village quickly. There will be a huge ground breaking things happening in the western border soon,\u201d the little guy said.\u201cYou\u2019re an interesting kid. As soon as we met, you warned us with this kind of information.\u201d The old man laughed as he spoke.\u201cChild, are you using frightening words to scare us?\u201d Uncle Hai asked.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d The little guy blinked his large eyes and carefully said. However, no matter what he said, he still had the appearance of a pretty and adorable porcelain child, so he did not look very trustworthy.\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen?\u201d The old man asked.\u201cAll the bad people on the western border will be punished severely!\u201d The little guy clenched his fists tightly.\u201cChild, what are you going to do?\u201d Grandpa Hai asked.The little guy carried the corpses of those experts kill by the father and son out of the forest and said, \u201cYou guys wait here a bit.\u201dFinally, he grabbed those corpses and charged into that shabby manor.\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do?\u201d The father and son duo brought little Qingfeng and chased after him in confusion.Soon after, their bodies went cold all over as a sudden fright overcame them.In the distance, flames reached into the heavens and a group of servants ran out as that manor was engulfed in a sea of flames.Uncle Hai\u2019s scalp went numb and said, \u201cThis is the Stone Clan\u2019s ancestral land. It\u2019s usually desolate and it doesn\u2019t matter if no one takes care of it, but who would dare burn it down. This will cause a huge calamity under the heavens!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s leave quickly, there will be certainly be kings who will personally come soon!\u201d Grandpa Hai had a huge headache. Never could he have imagined that the little guy dared to do this. This was truly reckless.\u201cAh, little elder brother actually dared to do this.\u201d Little Qingfeng was also shocked.The little guy returned and very calmly said, \u201cI only have one ancestral land, and it is not this place. I have absolutely no connections with that Stone Country anymore.\u201dWhen he was young, he had his Supreme Being Bone stolen away, yet the people there were very indifferent and persecuted his family. At this place, his substitute also experienced such misery and no one cared about him. This type of thing happened again and again, so he lost all sense of belonging towards the empire of the Stone Clan.Although he was kindhearted, he was not weak and dared to do anything.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Grandpa Hai\u2019s scalp was going to explode and he did not dare to stay any longer.Quickly, those people vanished.\u201cWhat, Stone Clan\u2019s ancestral land was burned clean in a sea of fire?!\u201d After the supervisor heard the news, his face went pale.Hou\u2026When Yu Meng heard the news, he released a world-shaking bellow because he knew it was all over. There will be a be a gargantuan disaster approaching, and all those who were born within the western boundary or even resided within were done for. Once an investigation was done, it would be impossible for any of them to escape.\u201cFool!\u201d Yu Meng roared loudly and swatted away the profoundly cultivated supervisor with a single hand. His mouthful of teeth flew away, and was dyed in his own blood.\u201cSir, I did not command anyone to do this!\u201d The supervisor was frightened as he trembled, and with a pu tong, he kneeled onto the ground.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who did it, it will attract a huge calamity. Stone Country will send out at least a few kings and investigate thoroughly along the way. The little things you did before will naturally be discovered and eventually link it to me\u2026\u201d Yu Meng was angry as veins blew up on his forehead and terror rose within his heart.\u201cGenuine kings will personally come\u2026\u201d The supervisor became silly. As he trembled and kneeled there, he almost scared himself to death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the supervisor heard this, he was paralyzed on the spot. His face turned pale without a trace of blood on it, and his body shivered with a coldness that made even his teeth tremble.He was incomparably dreadful. If this was investigated thoroughly, all of the people involved in this matter will be killed. He could already foresee people\u2019s heads rolling and tumbling down.Once a king became angry, blood would flow, and corpses would fall for 100,000 li with no one being able to stop it! He had no way of surviving. Even if the land under the heavens were large, he still did not have any places to hide.Let alone him, even Yu Meng was in fear as he paced back and forth. His heart was extremely terrified, as the matter had escalated so quickly. This was something he had absolutely no chance of concealing, since it was the Stone Clan\u2019s ancestral land being disrespected.\u201cI did not do it. How is this beneficial in any way\u2026\u201d The supervisor sat there paralyzed and kept repeating . He did not have that ordinary impressiveness to him any more.\u201cF*ck off!\u201dYu Meng was furious. He raised his foot to stamp him on the body \u00a0and suddenly the sounds of fractures transmitted through the air. The supervisor screaming wretchedly and vomited large mouthfuls of blood as his entire body flew into a rock garden close by.Hong Long, the rock garden tumbled down and buried him beneath as dust and smoke rose into the air.Yu Meng was expressionless. If he did not show off his power, he did not have the might that experts usually had, but now his eyes exposed an ominous glint. He wanted to get rid of the supervisor several times, but he hesitated in the last moment because killing the supervisor was still useless. With Stone Clan\u2019s enormous power, they would overlook nothing when investigating this matter..Then, he quivered and trembled. When he wanted to stop talking, he thought about whether or not his clan elders would have the same thoughts and eliminate him immediately, since this matter had been escalated to an overly extreme degree.In a huge city located in the western border, several experts activated a few rare primitive precious bones. After symbols flickers, the bones turned into an old and simple little altar, and they released a letter on top.After a flash of light, the letters disappeared.At the same time in the vast Stone Country\u2019s imperial capital, several precious bones of Archaic Descendants shined and turned into an even larger altar. Multicolored light flickered on top and a letter appeared.\u201cWhat, the second ancestral land was wiped clean in a sea of fire? They truly have guts!\u201dAfter a clan elder saw the letter, he became furious on the spot. Stone Country, whose country ruled over millions and millions of li of rivers and mountains, was in its golden age, yet such an unimaginable event happened to them!\u201cSend the letters out!\u201d He shouted loudly. The letter had been copied many times, with the original intended for the emperor while the others were being sent to kings of various Stone Families. This matter was too great, and he believed that this was a provocation towards the entire Stone Clone.Hong!That day, it was as if the imperial city exploded. A huge controversy arose before completely erupting, and many people were discussing in disbelief over this event.\u201cWho did this, does he want to go against the heavens? The Emperor is at his golden age with an unparalleled divine might, and there is actually a person who burned the Stone Clan\u2019s birthplace to the ground. They are truly too daring!\u201d\u201cEven the mortal enemies of Stone Clan would not go this far. Even if they were fighting, they would go after the people who were alive. Who would do such a thing like this?\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a Dragon Beast, Hornless Dragon, or any other Archaic Descendants who hated Stone Country right? Could it be possible that a group of vicious birds created the fire?\u201dThe news rapidly proliferated, and soon after, the entire imperial city knew. Everyone felt that this was inconceivable and discussed this all everywhere.\u201cFind who did this!\u201d The emperor gave the orders using these four words. His orders immediately shined outside, and emitted rays of light that reached into the skies. Those six words were like immortal swords as they dispersed the clouds above the imperial city, releasing a killing intent that overflowed the heavens.Golden rays of light bubbled up explosively like lightning across the sky which rumbled every direction into a state of silence. At this moment, the entire imperial city calmed down without any traces of discussion.The imperial city only returned back to normal after a long time.Atop a divine altar within Stone Country, precious offerings were being laid. These were sacrifices that were made to the ancient gods, and currently, several precious bones that used to belong to Archaic Descendants began to emit light.With a weng sound, it was as if an ancient god\u2019s awakened. The air was filled with a terrifying aura, and soon after, a golden passageway opened.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d shouted a clan elder. Following that, squadrons of powerful war generals rushed out one after another, treading onto that golden passageway. They were all wearing shining armor, and metal spears and battle pikes were in their hands as their killing intent overflowed into the heavens.In the end, three kings appeared. Their entire bodies radiated bright and resplendent rays of light, and it was as if they were three suns. Their terror shook the world as they stepped into the golden passageway together.This time, three kings actually made their moves, and it was up to them to investigate this event thoroughly.The clan elders only brought people to worship at the altar after everything had calmed down. Chaotic mist filled the air, as if an ancient god was there to accept their great gifts.In reality, there was nothing there!Within the Martial King\u2019s manor, all of the residents were in alarm. Over ten clan elders had been invited, and this was all due to the fact that the ruined manor was too large of a topic and involved their entire bloodline.\u201cWhere is Yi\u2019er. Is it the people under him who did it?!\u201d The fourth elder who looked like a golden lion roared.\u201cImpossible. Although Yi\u2019er is young, he is wise and earnest. How can he do something so stupid. I believe that it must have been someone else,\u201d said a clan elder.Soon, the eastern border received some information after making some initial investigations. The arson was caused by some rising resentment, and it was possibly related to a large clan within Stone Country.When they received the news, it immediately sparked a massive controversy.\u201cIsn\u2019t this simply looking for death? No matter what kind of grudges they held, daring to do such a thing would only result in their demise. Do they want their entire clan exterminated?!\u201d\u201cThis is a matter of one\u2019s morals. A son of some king\u2019s family who doesn\u2019t know how high the sky is or how thick the ground is must have went to the western border to create a ruckus. Isn\u2019t this simply digging a deep hole? Their entire clan will all be dragged in.\u201dThe imperial city was filled with chatter everywhere. Many clans were scared, in fear that their own family\u2019s children had provoked this calamity.\u201cAi, Yu Meng sent back some information. Although our Rain Clan didn\u2019t do this, his underlings\u2019 underhanded actions cannot be concealed, and would similarly evoke dissatisfaction from the kings.\u201dA clan elder of the Rain Clan sighed heavily, since this disaster really was unexpected and unimaginable. If they truly wanted to investigate into it deeply, the people of the Rain Clan would all seem pretty disgraceful.\u201cClan brother, you\u2019re talking about it too lightly. No matter how it goes, we have to bear some of the consequences regarding the arson of the Stone Clan\u2019s ancestral land. Most likely, that supervisor messed up. He probably made others take this risk out of desperation, burning down the imperial clan\u2019s ancestral land.\u201d\u201cTake out all of the benefits the western border has to offer, and kill off everything else. I think doing things this way should be alright. Try your best to protect Yu Meng.\u201d\u201cThe western border has quite a few people, and they are all well trained. How do we kill them all?\u201d Someone opposed.\u201cWe can\u2019t take on this responsibility. I feel like this is most likely done by Shi Ziling for the sake of framing our clan!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We can do it like this. Let\u2019s tell Yu Meng that he must bite down on this matter and say he found Shi Ziling, and then try his best to find any tiny hints regarding Shi Ziling\u2019s whereabouts.\u201dEveryone in the rain clan was discussing countermeasures for the current situation.In the western border, those war generals all seemed like wolves and tigers. Their expressions were like lightning, and they were all extremely powerful. On the second day, they discovered some clues and brought away the supervisor.Searching like this, they discovered many things that should not have come to light. Although they did not commit the arson, clearly, they might be the root cause, as having the impertinence to collude with the servants of the ancestral land was already rather disgraceful.On that day, heads tumbled down. After those people in the manor who colluded with the servants had been interrogated, they were all beheaded. Fresh blood spilt out, and a large amount of corpses were stacked together!Immediately afterwards, the supervisor confessed and was sentenced to death by a thousand cuts and died. The people within his clan were all incarcerated. This was all because the supervisor had not tried to commit suicide or escape, and so they decided not to immediately exterminate his clan.Two days later, Yu Meng was escorted off to a huge city. When he was captured, he still wanted to refute, however he was immediately whipped in the face by a war general, causing his blood to blossom and fly into the air.Typically, he was rather harsh and unreasonable, but the trusted war generals of the kings were even more harsh and unreasonable!Yu Meng went silly as he was brought into a majestic palace hall within a huge city. Above him, there were three large and splendid suns. Rumbling sounds could be heard, and large portions of symbols were being emitted, making it impossible for people to directly look at them.He understood that this was a genuine king who controlled a land that ruled over the lives of over 100 million people. They were the most powerful people under the emperor, and were world-shakingly terrifying!The three suns released a divine splendor, and strand after strand of symbols began to condense. Within the gathering of symbols, it was as if they were trying to refine this area of heaven and earth. The three kings sat upon their thrones, and it was impossible to see their figures clearly.Only three pairs of eyes could be seen, and they were much brighter than the symbols creating the mist. One of the pairs looked like the sun\u2019s destruction and the moon\u2019s submergence. The other pair appeared as if it stars were taking form, and the last looked as if the primal chaos were diffusing. They were obviously three pairs of eyes, but they made the people feel as if the heavens themselves were opening.\u201cIt has nothing to do with me. I feel that Shi Ziling might have done this.\u201d Once Yu Meng entered, he immediately spoke these words. He accepted the orders from their clan\u2019s elders and wanted to use any methods to wash this blunder away.\u201cDon\u2019t speak without thinking, chop!\u201d A king indifferently said. His pair of eyes shot of an area of incomparably terrifying symbols, and shook everyone in the lower level of the palace hall.A war general walked forward, took out a sharp blade and immediately swept forward.\u201cCalm down my king!\u201d Yu Meng shouted, but absolutely no one paid attention to him. The war general\u2019s weapon flashed passed. With a pu sound, the sound of blood splashed out and one of his arms fell to the floor.He let out a wretched scream. Never could he have thought that those kings above would be so tyrannical. Without fearing any consequences, they chopped off one of his arms as soon as he came up. What was the reason behind this?\u201cMy king, I am a child of the Rain Clan, I\u2026\u201d\u201cThis king doesn\u2019t want to hear nonsense, chop again!\u201d Another indifferent voice echoed down from the throne above.With a pu sound, blood blossomed out, and Yu Meng\u2019s other arm also fell to the floor. It was so painful that he began to wretchedly scream. His face became deathly pale as his head almost fell to the ground.He never could have imagined that such a day would come. He was a direct descendant of the Rain Clan, so his position was not low. However, there were people who unexpectedly dared to treat him like this and didn\u2019t even consider him a side dish.He wanted to roar out of fury \u2018you are a king, so you need to be more considerate as I am the intermediary between the Rain Clan\u2019! However, on the verge of speaking, he swallowed his words again in fear of provoking even more pain.Then, he quivered and trembled as he thought \u2018this couldn\u2019t have been directed against his Rain Clan right? Otherwise why would they dare to do such a thing.\u2019 Thinking up to this point, a whiff of cold air rose from within his heart.\u201cSpeak, you are forbidden from speaking any lies.\u201d The words of the people above were ruthless and concise.Yu Meng endured the pain by using some flickering symbols on his broken arms to staunch the bleeding. Then he began to \u2018confess\u2019 and recount everything. Of course, he would not admit his own mistakes and tried his best to dispel and push the source of this disaster away from him.\u201cI only want to hear facts, I don\u2019t want to hear refutations!\u201dAbove the palace hall, a king flicked his finger and suddenly, an area of silver light as vast as the seas surged forth violently. With the two pupu sounds, both of Yu Meng\u2019s legs exploded and his entire body flew across the room.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d The pain was unbearable, and he was on the verge of going insane. How could it end like this? This king truly did not care about face. No matter how big the crime was, he shouldn\u2019t be treated like this. Their methods were too severe, and were simply too scary and frightening..Yu Meng was discouraged. All of the kings had too much power. If they wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as turning their hands. They could simply stomp him to death with one foot, and no one would be able to stop them.In the end, he could not bear it any longer and said recounted everything as they happened.\u201cDrag him out and behead him.\u201d An emotionless voice echoed down from above.\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Yu Meng was worried and threw caution out the window.\u201cBecause I\u2019m a king!\u201d The person above said indifferently. Rays of light bursted into the heavens and submerged the entire magnificent group of buildings.These words shook Yu Meng until his entire body weakened, paralyzing him on the spot; he was full of regret.Two war general walked forward and dragged him outside the palace hall. It was as if they were dragging a dead dog, treating him as him he were absolutely nothing.Yu Meng shouted out in dismay and said, \u201cIf you guys don\u2019t escort me back safely and just carelessly kill and behead me like this, how would the people of the imperial capital react? You guys don\u2019t have concrete evidence, so this is simply a total disregard for life!\u201d\u201cWe are investigating on behalf of our emperor\u2019s commands, and he has completely trust in us. Who would dare to disobey?\u201d An imposing voice echoed from within the palace hall.At death\u2019s door, Yu Meng suddenly realized and had a rough guess at who the person in the palace hall was. It should be the War King who was rumored to have admired the young genius, Shi Ziling.He quivered and trembled, since no matter what he said, it was too late.With a pu sound, a head flew upwards, and Yu Meng was beheaded immediately, passing away within the western border. Once news of this returned to the imperial capital, it evoked shock, as this was like whipping Rain Clan\u2019s face.Afterwards when people learned it was the War King, they were all at ease again. With his title, it was no longer a surprise. There weren\u2019t many things he did not dare to do.Within the huge city on the western border, the War King no longer made any moves after beheading everyone. A kings at his side opened his mouth and said, \u201cThis matter might perhaps be related to the Martial King Manor.\u201d\u201cOh, Rain Clan and Military King\u2019s Manor are connected through marriage. There should be something here,\u201d another king nodded.\u201cNot bad, keep investigating. No matter what, they must all be warned.\u201d The War King declared.Military King\u2019s Manor produced Shi Yi, who had exceptional heavenly talents. He was like the rise of a blazing sun, and he shocked the vast earth. There were also geniuses among these king\u2019s later generations, and they similarly had the qualifications to fight for the emperor position. They would never let go of any opportunities to obstruct each other.The matter had been escalated so much, and the Rain Clan were truly unwilling to accept the results since everyone within the western border had been killed. Heads stacked up like mountains, and even an important disciple of the family couldn\u2019t escape death. They escalated this issue all the way to the emperor.Even the Martial King Manor was very passive as well, as they had been linked to this matter.The imperial city trembled, and a great wave surged over this entire place. Finally, the emperor showed his face, reprimanded some relevant people, and killed even more people. Only then did this disturbance gradually calm down.But all this had nothing to do with the little guy. He brought Qingfeng into the great wasteland since they had already parted ways with the Hai family.\u201cThis is the Snow Leopard\u2019s milk, it tastes the best. You try it, it\u2019s so sweet and delicious.\u201d The little guy\u2019s face was dirty, and only his pair of big eyes were very bright and shiny. They entered the great wasteland once again, and since they could not avoid battling with vicious beasts, his body was stained with quite a bit of blood.\u201cI\u2019m already seven years old. I don\u2019t drink milk anymore.\u201d Little Qingfeng felt embarrassed.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, no one\u2019s watching. It\u2019s truly very delicious.\u201d The little guy held a bamboo straw and drank a whole mouthful. His eyes were infatuated as they became crescent moon.\u201cReally?\u201d Little Qingfeng blinked.\u201cReally!\u201d The little guy carefully nodded.On another mountain range, the father and son duo of the Hai Family were constantly paying close attention to external affairs. During these few days, their hearts surged up and down like the tide, and they had a tough time staying calm.\u201cThat child is truly a talent. No, he\u2019s a heaven-warping genius. He has unlimited potential in his path of cultivation.\u201d Uncle Hai sighed.\u201cIf we meet again one day, I believe his name will have already shaken the entire country, and his name will spread to all the land under the heavens.\u201d Grandpa Hai also sighed.\u201cAoooo\u2026\u201d At their side, a black tiger roared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was such a young child, yet his foot was already broken. His heart was naturally be saddened and he longed for its restoration.\u201cIt\u2019s possible. After applying some precious medicine, it will will be cured for sure.\u201d The little guy shifted his gaze towards Hairy Ball on his shoulder.Hairy Ball was originally sound asleep, but he suddenly shivered and quivered, waking up from his sleep. He rapidly leapt off from his body onto an ancient tree as it vigilantly looked downwards.\u201cHairy Ball, don\u2019t be so stingy. Qingfeng is already like this, do you not want to help him?\u201d The little guy laughed as he beckoned towards it.Zhi Zhi! Hairy Ball screeched and was unwilling to jump down.Qingfeng\u2019s left foot was bitten by a poisonous Flood Dragon, and although his wounds have closed, that area still looked quite terrifying. A sarcoma grew there, and it greatly contrasted with his pretty little face.Poisonous Flood Dragons were not actually genuine Flood Dragons. They were more like vipers, only that they were several meters longs like a unicorn. Their bodies, however, were highly toxic, and whoever it poisoned would inevitably die. On the day that Qingfeng was bitten, if it an ancestral elder did not disregarding his own circumstances to detoxify and replenish his life force using his own innate essence when Qingfeng was critically ill, he would certainly have died immediately.\u201cToo vicious, he is such a young child, yet they still had the heart to take such actions.\u201d The little guy had the tone of a little adult, and he forgot that his own age was not that great either..As he spoke these words, the western border were in turbulent times. A great quake spread across Stone Country\u2019s imperial capital, and invoked a huge killing spree. However, the person responsible \u2014 the little guy, had lost all awareness of this as this was outside the scope of his knowledge; he had forgotten that he had sparked these events a long time ago.\u201cLittle Big Bro, where are we going?\u201d Qingfeng asked.\u201cReturning to our clan\u2019s true ancestral land. When you nurse your wounds completely and trained your body a bit, we\u2019ll go to Heaven Mending Pavilion together after I get a little stronger.\u201cAh, true ancestral land?\u201d Little Qingfeng widened his eyes in surprise.Xilulu\u2026 The unicorn held its head high and released a long neigh. Its entire body was a silver white as its scales flickered gloriously. It carried the two children and soared across mountain gorges and into the distance.The great wasteland had many fierce beasts, and so there were many bloody battles on this journey. However, the little guy had already journeyed through here, so the returning route was a lot smoother.When Qingfeng heard his little big bro had traversed the 300,000 li of the great wasteland by himself, his little mouth was left wide agape. He exposed a shocked expression and felt that if news of this got to to Stone Country, it would certainly invoke a world-frightening wave.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge bird\u2019s nest on the summit there that covers the entire mountain top!\u201dOn top of a lofty mountain within the heart of the mountains, there was a gigantic bird\u2019s nest that had a diameter of over a hundred meters. It was constructed on the mountain peak, and possessed an oppressive aura.In the distance, an enormous vicious bird streaked across like a black cloud. It was over 100 meters long and was 200 to 300 meters long with its wings spread. Its demonic aura shocked the heavens, and all the feathers on its body seemed like they were casted in metal as they flickered in terrifying rays of light.On this entire journey, little Qingfeng cried out in surprise from time to time. He had never traversed through the great wasteland and had never seen such a terrifying creature.\u201cYa, that tree consumed a huge Flame Rhinoceros!\u201dAfter a short while, they saw a tall and old tree. Its branch suddenly waved and penetrated a Flame Rhinoceros over several zhang long, absorbing its blood. It was extremely terrifying as the entire tree transformed into a red color.\u201cThe great wasteland is very terrifying. There are all kinds of bizarre creatures here, so we have to be cautious and careful. If we relax for even a bit, we might encounter a situation where we lose our lives,\u201d the little guy warned.This was a bizarre world, and at the same time, it was also a terrifying world. The natural living environments were nasty, and the competition was cruel. Humans had to struggle and fight in order to live on.They were very careful throughout their entire journey and avoided many dangerous areas. Those places were not places they could travel through right now. The mists were dense, and they could see various terrifying figures come and go; it astonished their souls.Of course, they could not avoid a bloody battle forever. There were many vicious birds and fierce beasts throughout this journey. The little guy had to experience many fierce battles everyday, and his body bathed in more and more beast blood as he traveled.After a journeying for over twenty days, the two children finally approached Stone Village. Their beast skin clothing were already covered all over in streaks of blood.\u201cWa, savages, two savages are here!\u201dNear the dark blue lake shore, a group of children saw two bloody figures and began to cry out as they rapidly surrounded them.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. That blackish-red horse is a unicorn. The little guy returned!\u201d Those children near the lake shore finally recognized him.The little guy and his companion were in a rather difficult situation since even the unicorn had been dyed red-black in the blood of beasts. Its scales that previously flickered in silver light were full of bloodstains, and even Hairy Ball was no exception. It was clearly visible that they had encountered many bloody battles during their journey.\u201cAiya, little guy, you\u2019ve returned. The villagers were almost worried to death. You leave once and you leave for over fifty days!\u201d\u201cLittle guy, you look so miserable. I almost couldn\u2019t recognize you!\u201dA group of children rapidly surrounded them and showed their affection. Despite the fact that his body was filthy and covered in thick blood, they came up and put their arms around his shoulders and grabbed his neck as if they continued chattering as if they would never run out of things to talk about.\u201cWho is this child?\u201d They naturally saw Qingfeng and could not help but ask.\u201cHis name is Shi Qingfeng and he\u2019ll be my little bro from now on.\u201d The little guy introduced.A group of adults were all alarmed and quickly rushed out. Shi Linghu and the others were all so emotional to the point that even some very old elders ran out.A young child traversing the great wasteland by himself. Returning alive after traveling for over 300,000 li was truly a miracle.\u201cThis is too great! Child, you have finally returned. Being able to return alive is good enough already.\u201d The chief was normally very calm, but his voice was trembling right now. During these past few days, he was genuinely worried to no end.The trial this time was extremely difficult. Even if a group of fully grown experts traveled together, nine out of ten of them would still die, but the little guy succeeded.This was once a cruel trial by fire that the strongest Archaic Vicious Beasts such as the Hornless Dragon or Leopard Dragon placed their children through. Even those terrifying children of the vicious beasts might still die halfway through.The little guy succeeded; moreover, he returned while protecting another child!\u201cChild, you\u2019re extraordinary! You completed the most terrifying trial, and you will inevitably fly into the heavens one day!\u201d A group of elders trembled with incomparable joy to the point that some of them had tears in their eyes.How many years have passed already? Stone Village\u2019s legends have already been treated like stories by others, and no one believed that they once possessed such ancient glory. With this child\u2019s sudden emergence, they truly believed that recreating their former glory was no longer impossible.\u201cChild, have you broken through?\u201d The chief asked with deep concern.\u201cI haven\u2019t. I\u2019m preparing to seclude myself within the village. Breaking through is not a problem, as I want to rush into even greater heights.\u201d The little guy answered.Everyone nodded as they felt happy for him.\u201cYou did well. You\u2019ve successfully completely this ancient trial by fire,\u201d the willow said. When the villagers heard, they suddenly began to pay their respects.Little Qingfeng was startled as he curiously watched.The little guy was amazed since the willow tree in front of him was now so different. A lot of its scorched black tree bark had been shed, and it also had some protrusions on its tree trunk as if something was going to drill out.\u201cI am going to train behind closed doors, and go into deep hibernation for a year.\u201d When Willow Deity came out with such a news, it made the hearts of the villagers tremble.\u201cHonorable Master Willow Deity, you\u2019re okay right?\u201d A village elder trembled and asked.\u201cThis is a good thing for me, but you all will need to watch out, because I have no way of protecting you for the next year,\u201d said the Willow Deity.Everyone\u2019s mind was startled. They were going to lose the protection of the Willow Deity because of this deep slumber, and this made them feel uneasy. The only rejoiceful thing was that there were no evil beasts here, and no tragic incidents have occurred.\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Willow Deity hibernated for a long while last time as well. Aren\u2019t we all fine right now, there should be no problems.\u201d Shi Feijiao comforted the villagers.\u201cYou are quite excellent, so don\u2019t waste your innate gifts. After I wake up, I will show you a different world.\u201d These were the warnings that the Willow Deity gave to the little guy.Just like that, the willow tree\u2019s entire body became dark ever since that day. That green and glossy branch no longer shined within the night as it fell within its deep slumber.Putong, Putong.In the beautiful, clear, dark blue lake, a group of children jumped in one after the other. They were swimming without worries, and they shouted and screamed joyfully as they played.The little guy striped himself clean and ferociously dove inside to wash away all the bloodstains from his body. Qingfeng watched in envy from the shore since he did not know how to swim.\u201cCome down, it\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll teach you how to swim together.\u201d A group of larger kids shouted.\u201cAh, I won\u2019t, I\u2019m scared of the water.\u201d Qingfeng cowered, but he was still forcefully dragged inside. Under the protection of the group of children, he plopped up and down for a whole hour until he finally learned how to swim.\u201cIt\u2019s truly beautiful. This place is too pretty.\u201d Qingfeng was extremely happy. Within the azure lake, little fish with gold scales covering their bodies sometimes emerged before their eyes, and as they jumped out of the water, they flickered in their precious splendor. On the soft green grass by the shore, groups of birds paced back and forth. There were many different species there, and their brightly colored feathers circulated with a magnificent splendor. They were not startled by the sight of humans, and all of them were exceptionally beautiful. There was also a herd of unicorns running by the shore, incomparably pure and holy.Qingfeng felt that this was simply an illusory world within his heart. It was so tranquil and auspicious that there was nothing to bother him. If he could live here for a long time, he would certainly be incredibly happy.During the evening, the group of children went onto the shore in secret, and Hairy Ball behaved even more underhandedly as he hid and watched from within a bush.\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Little Qingfeng puzzledly asked Shi Hao.The little guy replied, \u201cThey are preparing to steal bird eggs. They are very rare and precious egg laid by little Luans. They are a precious medicine used for healing. Under normal circumstances, the chief will not let them randomly do this.\u201dQingfeng was amazed while simultaneously feeling very fascinated.Sure enough, sooner after, chickens flew and dogs jumped as chaos spread throughout the beautiful lake shore. A group of children as well as Hairy Ball stole a pile of multi-colored striped bird eggs and roasted them over the fire.Shi Linghu\u2019s voice echoed from the distance, \u201cYou bunch of brats. You are forbidden from doing this in the future. Otherwise in the future, all these precious birds and strange beasts will be scared off.\u201d\u201cWe understand!\u201d The children giggled and laughed as they ate the fragrant bird eggs together with a mouthful of the roasted golden and shiny Dragon Whiskered Fish. They were all incredibly satisfied.\u201cThis place is so good!\u201d Little Qingfeng was extremely happy. With this many playmates and so many interesting stories, he felt extremely joyful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soon after, the sounds of a sacrificial ceremony began to resonate. On top of the cauldron, many realistic images of divine birds and strange beasts appeared as if they charged out of the cauldron walls.Hairy Ball was anxious as he used one little claw to cover his own large eyes. It extremely unwillingly bit into his other little claw to release two drops of its golden blood into the cauldron.Then\u2026as if it had broken an arm, it wretchedly screamed as if it had killed chickens and slaughter ducks before escaping back to the little guy\u2019s shoulder. It covered one eye and peeked with the other.The group of people could not refrain from smiling. This fist sized golden sphere was too very weird and lively, provoking their laughter.The medicinal cauldron shined even brighter, and became even more mysterious. After it began to refine this precious medicine, it emitted a rich fragrance, and multi-colored light radiated everywhere. Thousands of ribbons of various colors were extremely magnificent and mysterious as they revealed their light.\u201cQingfeng, don\u2019t be nervous. Connecting your broken tendons will certainly be successful. With these precious medicine here, I guarantee that your bones will regenerate.\u201d The little guy consoled.This process was very painful. The scar on Qingfeng\u2019s foot was peeled off once again, and it began to bleed. He cried out loudly in pain as tears continuously tumbled down, but he did not struggle when Shi Feijiao applied the precious medicine on it.\u201cYour muscles and bones have already been aligned. After applying this rare precious medicine on it, it will heal for sure. Don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d The elder consoled.No one else touched this cauldron of medicine, and they left it completely for Qingfeng. After some of it had been applied onto his foot, he also consumed a lot of it. After a few days, his foot began to itch as his muscles and bones regenerated and connected together.\u201cTruly worthy of being the blood of a Zhuyan!\u201d Some elders gasped in surprise.In just a few days work, the broken muscles and bones on Qingfeng\u2019s foot connected again. After raising it for a while, it will inevitably heal and completely fine.Everyone exposed an astonished gaze as they looked towards Hairy Ball.It suddenly began to miserably shriek and roll within the little guy\u2019s shoulders. Finally, it extended a little claw as it gestured and waved with all its might. What it meant was \u2018yes, but in the future don\u2019t look towards me for these things. I won\u2019t do it even if you killed me.\u201dApart from precious medicine, the little guy used symbols to treat him everyday as well. After half a month, Qingfeng recovered, and all of his muscles and bones rapidly healed.\u201cPrecious medicines are so powerful! They possess such divine medicinal effects, making it heal so quickly!\u201d Everyone was astonished, but they did not know that the True Primordial Record that the little guy practiced in was also extremely effective.In the following few days, there was one more little figure by the lake shore that cultivated together with the children. Everyone shockingly discovered that aside from being feeble bodied, he unexpectedly understood the Bone Text. Although he was not as refined as the little guy, he was still very strong. In the words of the elders, he was a genius who was only being held back by his body.After a few days of self-healing, Qingfeng gradually got better. His pale little face became rosy again, and his blood began to flow through his body nicely. He started to run wildly with the children of Stone Village, and his physique no longer inhibited his actions.For the following few days, the little guy left early and returned late. He intensively studied the True Primordial Record by himself deep in the mountains, and he fought against the vicious beasts from time to time to test the stuff he comprehended.The name of the next realm was \u2018Heavenly Passage\u2019. For a cultivator, it was extremely important. The more profound knowledge accumulated in the Blood Transformation realm, the more explosive and terrifying the force in this realm would be.The little guy was constantly accumulating knowledge, hoping that he would charge into the heavens in this realm and astonish others with his performance.During the evening, the sunset glow seemed like blood as it dyed the skies in scarlet. Burning clouds bubbled and surged as streaks of gold embedded their borders, and even Stone Village seemed to be enveloped within this shroud of mysterious luster.Er Meng shouted and cried to attract the attention of the villagers. They only saw him saddled up on a unicorn as it madly galloping. Its speed was too fast, making his face turn white, and he was afraid of coming down.\u201cIt\u2019s not Little White that the little guy tamed, it\u2019s another unicorn. Er Meng, this child has truly increased his abilities and unexpectedly wanted to make this precious mount yield!\u201d A group of adults gasped in surprise since even they could not accomplish this.After hearing these words, Er Meng almost began to cry. As the back of the unicorn flickering with a silver light, he said with a sobbing voice, \u201cWho wants to make it yield? When I was feeding Little White berries, it came close and wanted to eat as well. It wasn\u2019t scared of me, and in the end\u2026my heart kept itching so I sat on top of it. However afterwards, it went crazy!\u201dWhen the villagers heard, they all bursted into laughter.In the recent days, Little White returned to the unicorn herd and was not restricted when it wanted to enter and leave the village. The villagers also fed it berries from time to time, and this made that herd of unicorns\u2019 wariness decrease a lot. Sometimes, one or two of them wanted to come close and eat some as well.It was just like what the little guy said. Gradually, this herd of unicorns will accept the villagers and will become their precious mounts.\u201cEr Meng, put some more effort into it. It didn\u2019t attack you, which means it still has some goodwill towards you. Don\u2019t fall down and lose face, just keep holding on.\u201d Shi Linghu yelled.Just like this, the unicorn circled the large lake over ten times, but it still was not tired. Er Meng almost vomited as if he was riding on clouds and fog.In the end, the unicorn stopped. It stood upright and threw him onto the ground, then it naturally jogged back slowly into the herd.\u201cThis is good. This unicorn is obviously amusingly playing with the children. It will be part of our Stone Village sooner or later.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng laughed as he gazed from the side.As far as the elders were concerned, they had a rough time breathing. They wished that they could obtain the precious mounts immediately.Sure enough, in the next few days, the unicorns relaxed even more and began to become increasingly intimate with the children. They allowed the children to climb onto their backs and carried them while galloping around the lake shore.This made the robust adult males envious, but they have no other ways. They looked very large, so it was not easy for them to gain the unicorns\u2019 trust. Thus, the unicorns were still quite vigilant towards them.A group of elders all began to laugh. Stone Village was \u00a0genuinely getting stronger and stronger. Soon, they would inevitably subdue over ten unicorns, and even thinking about it is making them smile.This type of lively animal was very hard to capture. Let alone a village, even a powerful tribe would have a hard time capturing a few, but soon, they will have over ten!Half a month later, the group of children clamored and shouted as over ten of them rode on the backs of the unicorns. They could handle them on the condition that they delivered large amounts of berries and raised them well.\u201cHaha, very good. Little guy, how about we race a bit? Let\u2019s see whose unicorn runs faster.\u201d Pi Hou and the others winked with a cocky expression.\u201cI still want to go cultivate,\u201d the little guy said.\u201cJust come. Cultivating everyday is so boring. Let\u2019s go relax and hunt for some vicious beasts in the mountains along the way. Isn\u2019t that still cultivation? We can return at night and barbeque some delicious stuff. How good is that?\u201d The group of children instigated.\u201cThat\u2019s fine then.\u201d The little guy thought for a bit then nodded.The adults\u2019 eyes were red once again. They still hadn\u2019t rode on any unicorns, yet the little brats had already rode on them. Many of them already had their own precious mounts.\u201cDazhuang, once you come back, quickly tame one for me and let your father ride it for two days. Otherwise, once you return, I\u2019ll strip you skin off.\u201d Shi Dazhuang\u2019s father angrily said.At the side, Shi Linghu also shouted, \u201cHuzi, did you hear that. You also have to tame one as soon as possible. Don\u2019t just care about being cocky yourself. If you don\u2019t let me ride it, I\u2019ll clean you up when you get back.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dA group of people burst out into laughter. The elders\u2019 eyes were all red because this truly made them speechless.The elders were unable to contain their happiness. The best circumstances that they could have imagined were gradually emerging, Stone Village was restoring its strength again, and perhaps the day when they could really recreate their former glory was not too far off.The villagers were at ease. The little guy had already crashed his way through 300,000 li of the great wasteland. With him following closely behind, there shouldn\u2019t be many dangers they couldn\u2019t face.\u201cWe\u2019re going!\u201d Er Meng shouted and charged out first.\u201cSlow down, wait for me.\u201d The nasally kid was last as he wiped his mucus and chased. Even he had obtained a unicorn\u2019s consent, which made the group of larger children who were temporarily without a mount speechless.The silver hooves of over ten unicorns rampaged like divine holy arrows as they left their line of sight. They drew out streaks of silver light as they entered into the mountain range.\u201cLittle guy, let\u2019s compare a bit.\u201d Pi Hou started being cocky again.\u201cYour unicorns cannot match Little White,\u201d said the little guy. Originally, Little White was already the strongest unicorn when he had selected it, and it even consumed the egg of the Rainbow Peacock and drank the Zhuyan\u2019s blood to become healthier. Rays of silver light circulated all over its body, and it was an extremely spirited horse.The unicorns ran especially quickly, and as the group of children shouted and fussed, they had already charged over 100 li away. As expected, Little White lead by a wide margin and waited from way ahead.\u201cLet\u2019s go hunting. We should show off our strength a bit too,\u201d Huzi suggested.Xiu Xiu\u2026Iron arrows streaked past the forest, arousing a large amount of beasts into shouting. After a short moment, the children who rode on the unicorns became startled, as they met a large fellow they were incapable of defeating.It was as strong as the little guy, and even he was urging Little White to madly escape. Behind them was a spiny beast whose entire body was black, and as it charged out, the incomparably sharp spines on its body reached into the heavens and flicked in black light.This spiny beast had the head of a Flood Dragon and the body of a hedgehog. It had an alligator\u2019s tail, and its body was an enormous seventy to eighty meters long. It opened its mouth to spout of fire, and immediately melted an entire mountain, causing magma to tumble and roll.The children\u2019s faces turned green on the spot. They urged their horses to dash madly, and did not dare to be cocky ever again.The little guy was at the rear, and he took care of the nasally kid and the others. Fortunately, the spiny beast wasn\u2019t very fast, and they shook it off after a short period of time.\u201cMy mom, that was terrifying. When I rode the unicorn outside the village, I thought that I had become a great hero. Right now, it looks like I\u2019m still a little bear who needs a lot more training.\u201dAfter escaping over several hundred li away, they stopped. They panted loudly as they still had lingering fear within their hearts.\u201cLittle guy you\u2019re truly something. Such a terrifying mountain range like this and you traversed over 300,000 li of it. That\u2019s truly terrifying!\u201dThey only rode out several hundred li, but they already encountered such a creature. If they were even a bit slower, they would have been swallowed or skinned alive, dying tragic deaths.\u201cThis is nothing. When little elder brother protected me while returning, we saw a ferocious beast as large as a huge mountain that crumbled a mountain with a swipe of its claws.\u201d Qingfeng said.The children were speechless, and they were in constant admiration.\u201cNot enough, I have to train bitterly. I have to obtain perfection in the Bone Text and become an expert earlier.\u201d Pi Hou vowed.Dazhuang, Er Meng, Huzi, nasally kid and the others all nodded. This brief thrilling moment made them realize the importance of power, and they had to exert themselves to struggle and survive.\u201cWhere are we going right now? We\u2019re about six or seven hundred li away from the village. Yi, there\u2019s chimney smoke coming from the mountains there.\u201d Er Meng pointed ahead.Huzi rolled his eyes and said, \u201cIs your house\u2019s chimney that thick and violent? And is it visible from a mountain away? That\u2019s a fire, let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201dOver ten unicorns rushed into the mountains ahead like a silver whirlwind. They peered down through the branches of ancient trees, and were immediately shocked.\u201cThat village looks like it could contain over 200 families, but now there\u2019s a house that had been set aflame. The blaze charged into the heavens as black smoke surged.There weren\u2019t any cries for help from within the village. Apart from the raging flames and thick smoke, it was lifeless.\u201cLook quickly!\u201d Dazhuang pointed into the distance.On the flat horizon, there was an enormous figure in the distance, and there were several people riding on fierce beasts. Their hands were holding sharp blades stained with blood as they retreated. Even while separated by such a huge distance, they could sense the thick and evil aura.\u201cWhat kind of people are they? Did they destroyed this village?\u201d Dazhuang and the others were shocked as they felt a chill in the air.The little guy did not say a single word as he stared at that enormous figure. It was a vicious beast that had flickering symbols on the surface of its body, and it was currently being worshiped by the surrounding group of people. He felt that it was highly likely that it was a Guardian Spirit.Only when that vicious beast and that group of people disappeared did the children begin looking at each other.\u201cLet\u2019s go down and take a look.\u201dThey rode on their unicorns and charged downwards. Just as they arrived at the village, they smelt the stench of blood piercing their nostrils. They walked forward and what their eyes saw was an appalling sight.Corpses were laid atop each other in a pile of blood. There were old and gray haired elders whose heads have been chopped off and thrown onto the side of the road, and there were children in the early stages of infancy that were killed and beheaded along with their mothers.\u201cToo malicious. They did not even let the elderly and children go.\u201dWhen the children saw this wretched sense, they shivered all over as they were overcome by extreme anger; how could these people be so inhumane? Why did those people so maliciously murder even the weak women, children and elders who had no way of resisting?Some of the children\u2019s eyes turned red, and they could not help but weep.\u201cWhat kind of people were these? How could they do such a thing?\u201dThe large fire burnt on, and all the buildings were set ablaze. A fierce resistance had occurred in the eastern part of the village, and that was where a group of able-bodied men fought. However, they all became corpses and died wretched deaths, and even their weapons were snapped and broken.\u201cYa, this is the village\u2019s Guardian Spirit. It\u2019s been killed.\u201d A child astonishingly said.In the center of the village, there was an altar with a huge beast that looked like a lion with eight legs. Furthermore, it also had a pair of black ox horns on it. Its body was bloodied as it fell beside the altar, and half of its body had been bitten clean. Even the primitive precious bones within its body had disappeared.\u201cThat vicious beast that just left ate half of its body.\u201d The children were scared since even a Guardian Spirit unexpectedly became food.Flames rushed into the heavens within this village, and even the streets were roasted. The unicorns were a bit fidgety, and did not wish to stay here any longer.Suddenly, a feeble groan of a old and gray haired elder echoed through. His belly had been split open as his blood and intestines spilt onto the floor. However, to one\u2019s surprise, he was still breathing.\u201cOld grandpa!\u201dThe children jumped off their unicorns and quickly squatted down to checked on his injuries. However, they were immediately startled, because with such fatal injuries, he \u00a0had no way of living.\u201cSuch hatred\u2026 That group of people were too merciless\u2026 They did not even let children who several months old go as they massacred everyone in our village.\u201d The old man grievingly cried.Not far away, several children were thrown dead on the ground. Such cruelty was difficult to look at, and it made people\u2019s hair stand up.\u201cWho are they? Why did they do this?\u201d Huzi asked.\u201cThey\u2019re a group of vicious bandits who suddenly appeared. They came here once and demanded for our black gold. The deadline had been reached, so we had to hand things over. However in the end, they massacred our entire village, including our Guardian Spirit,\u201d replied the elder while crying. He was already so old, but his gray hair was sticky with blood, and his tears making people feel sad and angry.\u201cWuwu, hatred\u2026\u201d These were the old man\u2019s last words, and his life immediately reached its end. A single tear hung on his face, and as it dropped down, he no longer moved.In the end, the children left and headed back. The flames gradually diminished, and the entire village was turned into an area of scorched black ruins.Their moods were incredibly gloomy, and they were no longer in the mood for any hunting. They rode their unicorns to quickly return to Stone Village as they relayed this information to the adults.\u201cCould it be those people\u2026 A crisis is coming.\u201d A village elder coughed as he put his hands on his chest. He thought back to the matter during those years when a group of their men wandered the world together, yet only one escaped with their life in the end.\u201cGrandpa chief, who are they? What are they here for?\u201d The little guy asked.\u201cThey\u2019re a group of terrifying people, who came for the sake of\u2026searching for a Supreme God\u2019s treasure.\u201d The elder sighed with his face full of worry as he gazed into the distant earth.A Chinese way of omgPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He buried it in an ancient cave, and it contained all of its knowledge and skills.Ever since ancient times, there were countless people who have searched but it without achieving anything. Finally one day, a shocking lightning descended from the nine heavens, splitting open a piece of the mountain and revealing a corner of a cave.\u201cWe were the fortunate ones, but we were also unfortunate.\u201d Chief Shi Yunfeng\u2019s eyes turned into sadness. During that time, his good brothers had died, and only one person stayed alive. His heart was filled with endless pain.\u201cWe entered a school together and cultivated the Bone Text together. For a child who had originated from a little village, my talents were considered quite good, and I reached the Heavenly Passage realm. When that thunder descended from the nine heavens, I just happened to be training with my brothers when I saw that cave.However, that was also where the catastrophe started. They dug out many bone books, but they could not dig into the true gateway of the cave so, making it impossible to enter into the core region.The news were leaked, and they were continuously chased. All different parties acted with the intention of stealing their collection of bone books.\u201cThey did not know that although these bone books were very precious, they were not the genuine inheritances within the cave. They chased after us with killing intent the entire way, and we escaped into the abyss of the great wastelands, however, there was no way of getting out.Shi Yunfeng was at a loss. His group of brothers died one by one, and he had to suffer through an untold number of hardships. Only one other person survived with him, and they were the only two who lived on.When they went back to search for remnants, they noticed that time had already flew past. It was as if 10,000 years had passed, and there was nothing in existence.\u201cIt should have been the mysterious power of the Bone Text that buried the divine treasure underground, making it drift off into the distance. No one knows where it is now.\u201d The chief let out a sigh.Even though things ended up like so, they were still continuously chased. A group of incomparably strong and vicious bandits showed up with a Guardian Spirit following close behind, forcing them to endlessly flee.\u201cMany events happened after that, and only after many years did we finally break free from them. We returned to Stone Village with heavy injuries.\u201dIn the end, only he lived and the other man died shortly after returning to the village.The chief did not go into detail about the past events, but there were certainly secrets and even more stories that he kept hidden. Being able to escape after being chased and killed for so many years, he was naturally not a simple person.Unfortunately, Shi Yunfeng who originally had extraordinary natural talent had his cultivation broken, and he also suffered heavy injuries. After that, his cultivation no longer advanced, and his body\u2019s condition gradually worsened.\u201cWhen we were in front of that cave, we suffered a hidden assault that injured our bodies. Afterwards, we were chased until our strange injuries worsened. As a result, after so many years, I can no longer easily activate the mysterious powers of the Bone Text.Shi Yunfeng described the events rather simply, but it was possible to imagine that he encountered too many dangers during those times. He only explained it to them in a few short sentences without going into any details.\u201cAt that time, the strongest power had over ten squads of vicious bandits beneath them, and they were in charge of searching for the sacred land of the Supreme Being. They have appeared again, and I feel that they have never given up their search in the first place.\u201dEveryone was startled. This was the first time the chief disclosed his inner thoughts and recounted his former secrets. Although it was concise and not very detailed, it made them sense the strained atmosphere of the terrifying murders.Many strong powers participated, and during those years, they naturally created an extremely dangerous situation.\u201cI believe that the Supreme Being\u2019s land should still be in this region. Although it drifted beneath the ground later, it still should not be too far.\u201dA circumference of 100,000 li was once massacred by those four great creatures, making this entire land barren and incapable of supporting land. If anyone wanted to search deep inside, it would definitely be incredibly challenging.However, vicious bandits appeared once again, signifying that new discoveries must have been made, and that this land could no longer remain peaceful.\u201cPrepare for the worst!\u201d Shi Yunfeng commanded. The Willow Deity was in a deep slumber, so if the vicious bandits found this place, they could only rely on themselves.\u201cUnfortunately, Aunt Green Scaled Eagle took Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing to train and cultivate, so I don\u2019t know where they are. Otherwise, they would certainly be a tremendous battle asset.\u201d The little guy regretted.The situation was even more critical than they had imagined. Several days later, Pi Hou, Huzi and the others brought back some bad news. They rode the unicorns to investigate and discovered another village 600 li away that had been completely massacred.\u201cI found a person alive, but he only lived for an hour and still died in the end.\u201d\u201cHe said that those people only wanted primitive precious bones and rare metals, and did not ask them about things related to the mountain range.\u201dThis was what the children reported back, and the chief frowned after hearing this. \u201cCould I have guessed wrong, and they aren\u2019t the same vicious bandits from back them? But those people back then also plundered black gold.\u201dHalf a month later, smoke and dust flew upwards into the horizon, and a group of people riding vicious beasts appeared and speedily ran towards Stone Village.\u201cNot good, prepare for war!\u201dThe villagers were anxious. Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others all held Dragon Horned Bows in their hands and aimed towards the distance. They stood at the village entrance and tightly observed the surrounding with the intention of protecting the village with their lives.This was a group of sinister and evil people who had taken the lives of countless people. All of their eyes exposed vicious expressions, and with a single look, it was easy to tell that they were unkind people as they rushed in front of the village.\u201cYou group of countryside savages want to resist? An attack from every one of us will kill and bury all you all here.\u201d A fierce beast charged forward, and a man with a scar over his face coldly spoke. He did not put this village in his eyes, and his ruthless aura was shocking.There were not many people in this group, only around 100. However, they were all people who were accustomed to war, especially that leader, who had a powerful grasp of the Bone Text\u2019s mysterious powers.Hong, Hong\u2026At the same time, a terrifying noise echoed from behind them. The earth was shaking and rumbling as an enormous creature appeared.This was a pangolin whose body was covered in a light golden color, and it was incredibly large. It was over ten meters long, and it was as if a golden mountain of flesh as it coiled there. Its pair of golden eyes seemed like lanterns as it gazed towards Stone Village with an extremely vicious and baleful expression.After seeing this vicious beast, everyone\u2019s hearts froze. This was a Guardian Spirit, how could an ordinary person defend against it?!An ordinary Guardian Spirit that protected humans would permanently stay within its village or town in order to accept the people\u2019s offering; it would not easily leave. However, this one actually moved out on its own.In particular, that Guardian Spirit\u2019s ruthless aura was incredibly heavy. Resting upon its light golden scale were faint traces of blood, signifying that it had certainly experienced an endless amount of slaughter. It even consumed other Guardian Spirits, and it was a creature that was best left unprovoked.A feeling of powerlessness overcame Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others. As soon as they saw it, they knew they had no way of dealing with this Guardian Spirit that was over ten meters long. Everyone in the village was going to die in vain.That terrifying bloody aura, that surge of strength that reached the heavens, and those terrifying symbols made everyone respect its power. As soon as they saw it, they could not help but produce a defeated feeling.\u201cDo you sense your own weakness? Just a bunch of insects, yet you delusionally believe you can fight against a Genuine Hou?\u201d Sneered the leader who sat atop the fierce beast.\u201cPut away your ridiculous bows and arrows. What can they do? They are absolutely useless. If you listen to our orders, we will not kill you!\u201d Another person laughed while sneering.\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d A very old elders walked forward while trembling and swaying.\u201cOld man, you only have to listen to our orders. No need for so much words,\u201d spoke their leader before cracking his horsewhip and whipping forward. A streak of symbols flickered, and the elder immediately flew as his blood splashed into the air.\u201cThird grandfather!\u201dA group of men charged out of the village and carried the elder. The children\u2019s eyes were all filled with tears, and even the eyes of the adult males were all red as they prepared to rushed forward and fight for their lives.\u201cStop!\u201d The chief shouted and did not permit them to act immediately.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that old man won\u2019t die. We\u2019re only teaching you guys a lesson.\u201d The one who made the move laughed loudly as he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not unreasonable people, and we don\u2019t want to kill people randomly either. As long as you guys fulfil our demands, I\u2019ll guarantee you guys will be unaffected.\u201dThe village all angrily stared forward without being able to say anything.\u201cWe\u2019ll give you twenty days. Give us 500 jin of black gold. If you have enough of it on hand, then consider yourselves lucky. If you don\u2019t, then find a mine quickly. Otherwise, when the time comes and you can\u2019t hand it over, we\u2019ll kill all of you!\u201d That man said in his cold and threatening voice.\u201cDid you hear that? If you are unable to accomplish this in twenty days, your village will be massacred. When the time comes, you\u2019ll all be exterminated, and none of you will be left alive!\u201d Another leader shouted loudlyAt the same time, that light gold Guardian Spirit also raised its head and howled, shaking all the surrounding mountain and ravines. Beautiful and bewildering waves of golden mist rose from its body, shaking everyone to the soul.The villagers did not make any indiscriminate actions. They were all distressed as there was a huge gap in strength, and it was truly difficult for them to defend themselves. They were far from being these vicious bandits\u2019 opponents.The children\u2019s little faces were all very tight, They were shocked, fearful, and angry since they had never encountered such a thing before. They had never been bullied all the way to their village entrance without any chance to defend themselvesThe Willow Deity was in a deep slumber as if were a lifeless tree, and so the village lost its protection. Their hearts were stifled and uncomfortable as they were itching to fight against this enemy.The children\u2019s eyes were all red to the point that tears almost fell. With an opponent this strong who bullied them all the way to their door, they had no way.\u201cJust a bunch of savages, yet you dare raise your bows in defense. Do you truly not understand life and death? You guys should know that there are several villages like yours in this region. If we didn\u2019t exterminate ten of them, we exterminated at least eight of them.\u201d A person coldly grunted as he swept his gaze across the village entrance.Shi Feijiao and the others were angry, but chief Shi Yunfeng order them to not act indiscriminately. Everyone clenched their fists tightly with incredible discomfort in their hearts. Had they ever been humiliated like this before?!\u201cRemember, you only have twenty days. Otherwise, your clan will be exterminated!\u201d One of the leaders said before lashing his whip with all his might.Symbols flashed past, and with a pa sound, a bloody scar appeared on Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and some other people\u2019s faces. Their skin and flesh were split open as their blood splashed into the air from their deep wounds.The group of able-bodied males were almost going to spit fire from their eyes. They feared death less than being disgraced. If it was up to them, they would have immediately fought with their lives.However, the chief was still restraining them tightly. He did not allow them to fight, and stopped them with his stern expression.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d A few leaders laughed before turning their vicious beasts around abruptly leaving.The light golden Guardian Spirit also turned its body around. Its large pair of lantern-like eyes coldly swept across all the villagers and soon after, it stepped forward, creating earthquakes that rumbled as it move. It was extremely terrifying.The fierce beasts roared, and the group of people disappeared in the blink of an eye.\u201cChief, why didn\u2019t you let us retaliate?\u201d Shi Linghu\u2019s eyes were completely red, and a painful heat scorched on his face. However, what was hurt even more was his heart, as he had never received such humiliation before.\u201cChief, I can\u2019t accept this!\u201d Shi Feijiao was also unable to endure this. He used his hands to wipe the blood of of his face, and even the hair on his head was going to stand up as his eyes became thoroughly red.\u201cThat\u2019s right chief, let\u2019s use the ancestral artifacts. If worse comes to worse, we\u2019ll see whether the fish dies or the net breaks!\u201d Er Meng\u2019s father shouted.Shi Yunfeng sighed and said, \u201cWhen the time comes, only the fish will die, and the net will not break.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s still better than being choked and wronged like this!\u201d Many people truly felt incredibly wronged.\u201cIf we really went to war, we are destined to die. There is no one here who truly grasped profound Bone Text yet, and will have difficulty displaying the full divine might of the ancestral artifact.\u201d The chief\u2019s eyes straightened up and he raised his voice as he shouted, \u201cDo you people believe I\u2019m scared of dying and wish to bear this silently? It\u2019s because we are truly powerless!\u201d\u201cEven if we endure it like this, what can we do after twenty days?\u201d Some people were unconvinced.\u201cTwenty days is enough for me to be ready. When that time comes, I\u2019ll bring the ancestral artifact and genuinely have a life and death struggle with them!\u201d spoke the chief.\u201cChief, the injuries on your body is very weird and also very serious. You can\u2019t use the powers of the Bone Text at all. You can\u2019t take chances!\u201d The people suddenly panicked.\u201cThat group also has such a powerful Guardian Spirit. No matter how many of you go out and fight, you\u2019ll all die. However,when I\u2019m ready, we might not be completely powerless,\u201d said Shi Yunfeng.\u201cChief, you can\u2019t!\u201d The group of robust men\u2019s tears almost fell. They knew that the reason why the chief was trying his best to obstruct them was precisely because he did not want them to die, and instead use his own life as collateral.\u201cGrandpa chief\u2026\u201d The children\u2019s tears dripped down.\u201cChief grandpa, give it to me. I\u2019ll handle them!\u201d At this moment, the little guy opened his mouth and showed his determination.\u201cYou can\u2019t, there are huge gaps between each level in the Heavenly Passage realm. Even if you breakthrough into that realm, you still cannot fight against them in such a short amount of time. Moreover, they still have that Guardian Spirit!\u201d The chief strictly opposed.\u201cI wanted to breakthrough just them and fight them right there, but the vicious bandits gave us twenty days of time, and I feel like that\u2019s enough for me to attain a perfect level. I can deal with them!\u201d The little guy carefully said with unwavering determination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was already very old, and his blood essence had already dried up; he had long lost his youthful courage and strength.At this moment, the corners of his mouth was filled with blood, dying his beard in a dark red. His facial appearance seemed very old as it contained a deep worry.The villagers felt as if their hearts were really stuffy, as this scene was incredibly difficult to bear. This elder was already eighty or ninety years old, yet he actually experienced such humiliation because they lacked the power to protect him.\u201cThose damn bandits!\u201d Shi Linghu clenched his teeth. The injury he suffered from the lash of the whip was still bleeding, and he wiped the blood off of that area of his face.\u201cElder, uncle, don\u2019t worry. Nothing will happen to me,\u201d said the little guy, and he promised that he was not just trying to be brave. If he was uncertain, he would not hastily take action.Such Vicious bandits appeared, and they heavily threatened Stone Village with a life and death matter. It did not matter whether or not they were the vicious people from back, as either way, this was an utter disaster.The villagers were all angry inside. When that group of vicious and rambunctious people came, they insulted the villagers and trampled on their dignity. They didn\u2019t put the villagers in their eyes at all.The children\u2019s eyes were red all over as they clenched their little fists tightly. They all wished that they could grow up immediately and solve this calamity by eliminating that group of vile people.\u201cWe will survive this crisis for sure. From now on, I have to cultivate well and get stronger. In the future, I will protect the elders and the village so that we will not be threatened again.\u201dThe children all swore with their young and tender voices, making all the adults feel uncomfortable. It made them feel as if they were somewhat to blame.\u201cIt is our fault that we are so powerless, without to strength to even protect the village.\u201d Shi Feijiao and the others clenched their fists tightly.\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. Our inheritance has been severed. You guys have only practiced the Bone Text halfway through your lives, missing the best golden age of your training.\u201d The chief shook his head.These adults were all men with bloody natures, and so even after hearing this, their hearts were still suffering intensely. Having been humiliated like this today, it made them extremely depressed.\u201cEveryone move out. Prepare for the absolute worst.\u201d An elder said.Then, the chief started to put things into order. He ordered people to call back the unicorns that hid in the forest. If this really did not work out, then these beasts will carry the women and children in order to retreat in advance.There are still twenty days left, and all the villagers began to get busy. Some people prepared for battle, some made the retreating arrangements, and others were bitterly cultivating and comprehending.Possessing unicorns was one of the villagers\u2019 trump cards. If things truly did not work out, they would use them to rapidly evacuate everyone. No matter how strong those vicious bandits were, they would have a tough time catching up.\u201cChief, is that scarlet feather any useful?\u201d Someone remembered the plume feather that the little red sparrow left behind.Chief Shi Yunfeng shook his head and said, \u201cIf we showed this in the outside world or in front of a few people with power, it should be very useful. However, in this type of great wasteland that only has these vicious bandits, they would simply exterminate us and not allow the news to spread out. It\u2019s not very useful.\u201dThe little guy journeyed into the mountains by himself and started his journey of charging through the mountain pass. Breaking through was not a problem, and he was thinking about how to explosively achieve the Heavenly Passage Realm in order and reach his desired heights.Drizzles sprinkled down elegantly and landed on the tree leaves, making them rustle. He sat cross-legged on top of a mountain border while he motionlessly listened to the voices of the heavens and the earth. His entire body entered into a state of absolute tranquility.Kacha!A bright ray of light streaked across the dull gray sky, and the sound of thunder rumbled. One streak of lightning after another flashed past, and they were like silver snakes as they danced in the air. They were all amazingly gorgeous as they produced deafening rumbling sounds.Within the mountain range, all kinds of land beasts began to roar, and all types of fierce birds began to cry. The entire area was extremely noisy.The little guy was still very calm as he sat there cross-leggedly. Even when the thunder-like sounds reached his ears, he still did reveal any movements. He was emotionless without a single shift in his expression, and his gaze was extremely peaceful.He was comprehending the natural laws, truths and mysteries regarding the Heavenly Passage Realm. He could breakthrough any time now, and be promoted to a brand new stage of life.Just like this, the little guy left early and returned late. He threw away all of his restraints, and completely put aside the fact that vicious bandits were going to invade them in the future. All of his thoughts were engrossed in cultivation as he prepared for this huge transformation.He even forgot the concept of time as he remained motionless for several days. He sat within the forest and gazed at the sun, moon and the stars while listening to the roars of ancient beasts. All of his consciousness was absorbed within the mountains and rivers.He was so absorbed that he had disappeared for several days, making all of the villagers worry endlessly. Fortunately, he appeared at the last moment.The little guy seemed to have gone silly. He threw away everything as he wholeheartedly immersed himself within his own transformed domain. He was constantly comprehending the laws and researching the mysteries of symbols.Tens days passed by in the blink of an eye. Whether the wind swept by or the rain hammered down, the little guy was always calm. He was undisturbed by the outside world as he immersed himself in his own cultivation world, and it was to the point where symbols flickered as he opened and closed his eyes.On the 15th day, the little guy held a pure white heavenly bone. As if he was isolated from the world, he started to delve into the True Primordial Record to comprehend the \u201cRecords of Battle\u201d on it. There was a fight between a Hornless Dragon and a Suan Ni on it, as well as a Rainbow Peacock Divine King fighting against a Gluttonous Beast. There was even a bloody scene where a Genuine Hou slaughtered a God.The precious bone glowed\u00a0and shined while producing auspicious rays of multi-colored light. The atmosphere was filled with a chaotic aura, and this time, the little guy was particularly peaceful and tranquil as he completely immersed himself in his cultivation.While on the verge of his breakthrough, he comprehended some of the true meaning that the True Primordial Record\u2019s \u2018battle records\u2019. His entire body had been refined, and it began to sparkle. His spirit was pure without a trace of impurity as symbols wrapped around his body.At this moment, his entire body was glittering as if he was cast within a seven-colored divine gold. Precious light circulated about, and various symbols began to transform one after another into shining furnaces within his flesh. He refined the Heaven and earth\u2019s natural luck, and made final preparations for his advancement.Heavenly Passage was a Realm, but it was also a method of cultivation. It drew in the essence between the Heaven and Earth to comprehend the symbols\u2019 true meanings. It allowed one to comprehend the order of the world, as well as how these rules change. It was similar to one developing one\u2019s own miniature world.This was precisely the Heavenly Passage Realm, and from the body\u2019s interior and exterior, it opened up an immortal passageway. It could also be called a \u2018Pure Land\u2019, or even its own world.Honglong!Suddenly, a massive sound was produced, shaking the entire wasteland. The mountain range trembled, and all the peaks resonated as if the heavens had collapsed, causing the heavenly palace to fall down.An area of dense dazzling symbols appeared, and it seemed as if they were refined from immortal gold. The symbols imprinted themselves between the Heaven and Earth, completely submerging the little guy within.A streak of blood essence charged into the heavens like raging waves beating against the shore. It bursted open the clouds in the sky until finally, a rocky cave that looked like a volcano appeared above the little guy\u2019s head.It looked unimaginably real, and it was as if it was cut and formed from genuine rocks. It was gray brown all over, and had an old and simple aura around it as it hovered three inches above the little guy\u2019s head.Within this cave that looked like a volcano, a life force was flourishing. It was a brilliant scarlet red, and it brilliantly dazzled as if it truly was a volcano.The little guy had broken through into the Heavenly Passage realm, and his life had been raised into the next level. After he finished the transformation, his strength advanced by leaps and bounds, and he became much stronger than he ever was before; even the heaven and Earth began to resonate with him.On top of his head was a gray brown volcanic crater. Its interior surged with scarlet red essence energy, and what allowed him to connect with this was the power from the natural order of Heaven and Earth. The external will absorb, and the internal with refine, linking the two together.Establishing the Heavenly Passage and entering this realm was equivalent to stealing the fortunes of heaven and earth. One constantly absorbed the essence energy of the outside world to supplement the internal body.After reaching this point and connecting the two boundless voids, one can refine the divine essence of the world. This was equal to allowing the divine strength from within the symbols to greatly increase in strength. It will far surpass one\u2019s former strength, and naturally become extremely powerful.From this point on, there would be a continuous and never-ending source where one could collect power from, allowing one to maintain their body\u2019s exuberance and vitality. As long as the battle wasn\u2019t too bitter and desperate, it was nearly impossible to completely exhaust one\u2019s energy, and one will be able to continuously maintain an optimal condition.Hong!Upon the little guy\u2019s head sat a massive, concentrated, and an ancient looking volcanic crater. It continuously bubbled with the scarlet-red essence energy, flowing downwards before dropping.After this happened, the essence in the depths of the great wasteland thinned, as it was being robbed by the volcanic crater. The scarlet red essence energy was just like magma, and it pierced through the little guy\u2019s head.This was directly, rapidly and explosively robbed from the external world to supplement his body with what he needed, maintaining his peak condition within this realm.\u201cThis is the Heavenly Passage Realm. So it feels like this.\u201d The little guy muttered as he closed his eyes to immerse himself within this incomparably beautiful realm.This is a powerful sensation that felt as if he was floating in the air. His entire body was very comfortable, and he was brimming with an explosive strength; it was as if his entire person was about to fly.Heavenly Passage Realm was far from just this. It established a connection to the heaven and earth from the internal and external. There were all kinds of mysterious ideologies behind this, such as raising precious artifacts within the Heavenly Passage to create the most powerful symbols.Before the little guy could explore even further, his body began to rumble and tremble again. Endless rays of multicolored light and auspicious colors spread out as the rumbling noise deafened the ears.On his left, another gray brown volcanic crater appeared. It looked extremely genuine as it formed in the empty air. Essence energy boiled within the volcanic crater as a silver color surged like strange magma.The little guy transformed, and another \u2018Heavenly Passage\u2019 beside him, causing his body to appear splendid. Drizzles of light flew and sprinkled everywhere in this beautiful scene, and it was as if an endless number of dazzling and holy flower petals fluttered in the breeze.\u201cYi, another one!\u201d The little guy was amazed. Could this be what the Willow Deity meant by good preparation is the key to success? He believed that the \u2018Heavenly Passage\u2019 was deep and profound, and that its essence energy flourished like the sea, however, it seemed like he had attained an even greater level.Under normal circumstances, being able to charge into this realm was already extremely fortunate. Many cultivators could not achieve this in their entire lives, however when the little guy just broke through, he already opened up two Heavenly Passages.Hong!However, this event still had not concluded. Symbols filled the empty air as they surged like the boundless oceans. They formed a vast and orderly domain that overflowed with auspicious multi-colored lights.Another Heavenly Passage formed!It appeared on the right side of the little guy\u2019s body, and the volcanic crater rumbled and trembled. Its inside were filled with purple \u2018magma\u2019 that constantly spilt outwards.Right now, there were three gray-brown colored volcanic craters, and they were located roughly three inches above, to the right, and to the left of his body. A never-ending source of power was being absorbed from the empty air, and red, silver, and purple \u2018magma\u2019 bubbled as it entered his body.\u201cYa, I did not breakthrough immediately and have been constantly accumulating energy. Afterwards, I even refined the Rainbow Peacock King\u2019s precious egg and and similarly accumulated its energy. There was indeed a great effect.The little guy was happy as a sweet smile hung on his face. His large eyes bent like crescent moons with incomparable happiness. He was instantly promoted to the Heavenly Passage\u2019s mid stage.If news of this got out, it would certainly stir up a huge commotion and shock the land. Breaking through into this realm was already so difficult, and breaking through multiple levels was something rarely heard of.At this moment, being able to open two Heavenly Passages in succession was already extremely rare, and was already considered absolutely impossible for non-heavenly warped geniuses. If news of this spread, it would truly scare people stupid.But the little guy was able to immediately open three Heavenly Passages during this instant. If news of this were released, it would definitely be well-known, and perhaps very few people would believe it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With even the slightest movement, and explosive force would be created, as if his entire body was going to fly into the skies.The three \u2018Heavenly Passages\u2019 that looked like volcanoes surged with essence energy. \u2018Magma\u2019 constantly flowed downward into the little guy\u2019s body, filling his body entirely with constant vitality and constantly keeping his body at its peak condition.A beast\u2019s cry echoed through, and an enormous creature appeared within this mountain range. It was over thirty meters long, and its silver fur shined like silk as a pair of Qilin horns grew on top of its head. Its eyes were as large as large washbowls, and its scarlet blood-colored pupils coldly stared in this direction.Its body was shaped like a white tiger, but it had a pair of Qiling horns growing on its head. Over ten bone spikes protruding out its back, and these one zhang long battle pikes sparkled with a snow-white luster.This was a genuine vicious beast that understood the mysterious meaning behind symbols. It occupied this area within the mountain range, and no one knew just how many vicious birds and fierce beasts it had to kill in order to secure its position as the tyrannical king. It was startled by the enormous sounds, and it began to feel as if something was offending its sanctity; therefore, it came to slaughter it.If this was the past, the little guy would have chosen to escape to immediately escape, however currently, he was not fearful at all. He calmly stood atop a rock as he cleared and calmly watched it with his large eyes.This vicious beast\u2019s killing intent surged at first, but after a short confrontation, it suddenly released a howl before turning around and running away. A stroke of its claws shattered a huge boulder over 10,000 jin below it into fine powder. Afterwards, it leapt up as multi-colored light circulated all over its body, as if a Silver Hornless Dragon was traveling through the mountainous area. Its heart was full of anger, and it opened its mouth to spit out white light, flattening the entire forest as its silver body disappeared into the heart of the mountains.In the empty distance, there were a few black spots that quickly rushed over. Several fierce birds appeared that flickered with symbols all over their bodies. They emitted a glaring radiance as their powerful aura oppressed everything, shocking tens of thousands of beasts into trembling; they were all exceptionally terrifying.Their killing intent surged, and were ready to swoop down at any moment.The little guy raised his head and two shocking beams of light shot out of his eyes as the bottom of his pupils produced two oppressive symbols.The vicious birds released a long cry, and instantly flapped their wings before charging into the cloud banks. They were shocked and angry, but they were feeling even more fear. They only stayed for a short while, and soon after, they rapidly flew towards the horizon before disappearing.Within the nearby mountains, even the strongest existences at the top of the food chain did not challenge the little guy, and were all cowering in fear.Shi Hao had never made any moves, yet he shocked the tyrannical kings of the mountains into retreating.He sat down cross-leggedly, and calmly comprehended the sensation of the Heavenly Passage realm. As he was immersed within, \u2018magma\u2019 bubbled forth, drowning him within. A mysterious mist began to rise where he sat.The little guy only stopped after a whole day and night. He stood up and faced the glow of the sunrise. He breathed in the divine light; he finally felt that his cultivation had completely consolidated. The three volcanic craters were collected inside, and they gradually disappeared as he took large strides towards Stone Village.\u201cWao, the little guy returned and he actually hunted a Flood Dragon Leopard!\u201dThe children all released their surprise as the little guy carried a huge beast over ten meters long. It had a leopard body, but had the terrifying head of a Flood Dragon. Even though it was dead, it was still emitting its vicious might.\u201cChild, did you make your breakthrough?\u201d The chief was pleasantly surprised.Otherwise, it was impossible for this Flood Dragon to be killed so easily, as it was extremely powerful. The little guy being able to carry it back with such ease was enough to illustrate this point.\u201cEn!\u201d Little Shi Hao nodded with his clear and exceptionally pure eyes. Within the glow of sunrise, his little body sparkled brilliantly. He made the people feel deeply moved, since he was just a child, yet was unexpectedly an expert of the Heavenly Passage realm.Many people had difficulty stepping into this realm their entire lives, yet during these few brief years, he rapidly reached these heights. Even when using the harshest eyes to judge him, one would still sigh in amazement.\u201cLittle Guy, have you gotten a grasp of it yet? Can you defeat that group of vicious bandits?\u201d A group of children ran from the lakeshore and surrounded him. They all clenched their little fists as hope shined within their eyes.The wounds that the elder who was whipped and sent flying bore, as well as the scars on their fathers\u2019 faces were still there. This kind of humiliation truly made people sad and angry, and it was difficult to suppress. Furthermore, the survival of the villagers had become a problem, and they might all die under the merciless killing of the vicious bandits.\u201cI will try by best, there\u2019s no need to be scared of them!\u201d Little Shi Hao had bristles of electricity flashing within his eyes.Two days later, rumbling echoed from the horizon, and a group of mounted people headed over. They were all savage and fierce beasts with dense scales all over. Although there were only around ten of them, they were as powerful a flood. They brought with them a frantic aura as they threw themselves over.They had not yet reached the deadline, yet these bandits decided to show up ahead of time. Their killing intent surged, and those enormous fierce beasts bared their fangs as they widened their bloody mouths. Their horns were thick and pitch black, making them appear extremely sinister.Only a small portion of the vicious bandits came, and their group did not include the main force or that Guardian Spirit. Even so, their demonic auras still violently surged, causing the the atmosphere around Stone Village to immediately feel chilly.\u201cYou rural people, are you guys ready?\u201d On top of a fierce beast, a male wearing a black scaled armor asked as he pointed at the villagers with the whip on his right hand.The villagers did not respond as they stared at him.\u201cAre you guys mute? Why aren\u2019t you talking?! There\u2019s only two days left until the deadline. If you people still do not have any black gold on hand, I think there\u2019s no need to wait for two more days!\u201d This leader\u2019s ruthless aura was severe. When he spoke, even his eyes stood straight.\u201cEn, there\u2019s a loss less people here. Did you guys actually escape?\u201d As another leader spoke, his face sunk. His eyes began to exude even more chilliness as he said, \u201cWithout our permission, you guy actually dared to escape. Do you truly not understand life and death? Do you think that by doing so, they can actually survive?!\u201dAmong these vicious bandits, several of them exposed a laughter as they revealed their dense white teeth. They merciless sat on their enormous mastiffs that were at least two to three meters tall and five to six meters long. The mounts had dog-like teeth that were like snow white daggers, and they were extremely frightening.These kinds of mastiffs who grew up within the great wasteland were ferocious and keen, and they had an extremely strong sense of smell. They believed that even if the villagers left the village, it was still difficult for them to truly escape.\u201cIf we recapture them, I want you people to clear understand the meaning of rather be dead than alive!\u201d One of the leaders opened his mouth wide, sending a bone piercing chill down the villagers\u2019 spines.\u201cYi, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Suddenly, the vicious bandits discovered the presence of unicorns. Their eyes immediately emitted an ominous glint and exposed their pleasantly surprised look.\u201cIt\u2019s a mutation of the scaled horses \u2014 a unicorn! They are robust and sturdy, and their entire bodies are glowing with a silvery white light! They can travel 10,000 li in a day, so they are an incredibly fast mount!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s more than one. There are actually so many!\u201dLast time, all of the unicorns were hidden in a nearby forest, and so they did not find them. However this time, they were caught red handed, and the vicious bandits squinted their eyes with incomparable excitement.These kinds of spirited beasts weren\u2019t the strongest, but they excelled in speed and were extremely rare.If they rode on unicorns, in the future, they would truly be like the wind and travel much faster. They would be able to move unhindered in this boundless great wasteland, sweeping away everything before their eyes.\u201cWu, they are being ridden by children. Are they preparing to escape?\u201d One of the leaders stared coldly before looking towards the group of adults at the village. \u201cTell them to come over and offer up their unicorns.\u201dHowever, not one person responded as the able-bodied males at the village entrance stared at him indifferently.\u201cYou rural brutes, are you guys mute? Did you not heard me? Tell those children to lead the unicorns over and present them to us. Otherwise, I\u2019ll massacre your village right now!\u201d Another leader wearing black armor all over threatened with a terrifying gaze that seemed like daggers.He urged the fierce beast to walk forward, and waved the horsewhip in his hands, lashing towards Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others. Last time, it was precisely him who inflicted that extremely large wound on the men\u2019s faces, causing them to bleed quite a bit. This time, he was still cruel and unreasonable, and instantly came up and whipped them with his frighteningly ruthless aura.Peng.The little guy walked forward and grabbed the horsewhip with his bare hands, obstructing them.\u201cYi\u2026\u201d This leader was amazed. He was the most clear about how strong his whiplash was, so he shocked when the child grabbed it with one hand.Weng, he gently flicked his wrist, and symbols began to spread along the whip as it extended forward. However, when they met the little guy\u2019s palm, they all extinguished immediately.\u201cLittle child, you\u2019re a bit weird!\u201d He was shocked and immediately stamped down with his feet angrily to step on the little guy\u2019s face.A beam of light flashed across the little guy\u2019s large eyes, and he was even faster than he was. Peng, he grabbed that foot and used a bit of strength to directly tear him off his mount. his body fiercely made a rotating motion, immediately smashed his body onto the ground.\u201cAo\u2026\u201d The leader wretchedly screamed.Dust and smoke surged up as his head and face came into close contact with the surface of the ground. His mouth and nose were spraying blood, and his mouth in particular turned into an area of mangled flesh; he had less than ten or so teeth within his mouth.This unforeseen event was astonishing. The vicious bandits did not think that this weak looking village would actually have someone who dared to oppose them. Moreover, it was a child which made them stupid for a moment.The leader was frightened and alarmed as his entire body began to shine. Symbols interweaved in order to struggle free; however, under the restraint of the little guy\u2019s divine strength, his struggles were futile. His ankle was grabbed by that little hand as if it was bounded by a leg iron, and it practically going to snap.The little guy swung him up as if he was waving a scarecrow, and simply yet violently smashed him upon the ground again.Pu!The noise of flesh disintegrating sounded, and this leader began to scream wretched again. This time, he was knocked against a huge boulder, and his body fractured all over as his body became broken.The little guy acted like he was throwing away a dead dog, and threw him towards the village entrance. Shi Linghu walked forward, stepped onto his chest with one foot and said, \u201cWeren\u2019t you guys being arrogant just a second ago?\u201d\u201cYou dare to take a whip and lash at the face of our elder. I\u2019ve put up with you for a long time now!\u201d A group of elders all gathered over and madly stamped down with their large feet.Ah\u2026Pu!This leader\u2019s face deformed on the spot, and was trampled into a rotten watermelon.Everything happened instantaneously. The group of vicious bandits were astonished because everything happened too abruptly. Last time, those villagers were as weak as sheeps and did not dare to retaliate. However today, how could a mere child be this violent. That group of fully grown men went insane!\u201cKill him!\u201d Another leader hastily shouted. He ordered the bandits to take actions as they prepared to slaughter their way towards the village entrance.Qiang, qiang sounds continuously rang out as the group of people took out their weapons before charging forward to massacre Stone Village.The little guy shouted out loudly and swatted towards the people who were charging at the forefront. Symbols were released, making his palm appear as large as a millstone all of a sudden. Peng peng noise echoed outwards in succession, and those vicious bandits flew away one by one as they were all struck flying.This was an astonishing divine strength that fractured all of their bones. After they were struck flying, they had a difficult time even standing up, and had could not budge an inch.in addition, these were only strikes the little guy randomly sent out, and even though he didn\u2019t put much strength behind it, it still created such a huge killing power.The remaining few leaders all lightly shouted. Their palms began to shine, and flourishing bristles bursted forth, illuminating the village entrance into an area of splendor. He activated the symbols to utilize a flame technique.Back when they use to burn, kill and plunder, he was one of their primary forces in charge of burning the villages. He buried quite a few people within this sea of fire, and this was done through relying on this exact flame technique.However today, it was completely useless against the little guy. The little guy simply reached out with his palm, filling the air with symbols, easily extinguishing that flourishing blaze. Then with a peng sound, it was as if that leader had been struck with the force of a mountain, and he flew across the air for over ten meters.Pi pa , pi pa sounds rang out and, a large portion of the bones in this leader had broken into pieces, and it was likely that he would never stand again.\u201cBandits, weren\u2019t you guys previously unbearably tyrannical? Where\u2019s your arrogance now?!\u201dShi Feijiao and the others advanced with heavy weapons in their hands and smashed forward. Every one of the strikes would splash up a string of blood.These vicious people who laid on the ground, each one of them had taken at least ten human lives. Normally, they were cruel and brutal. Now, however, fear loomed over them. With their eyes staring widely, they began to cry for mercy.The little moved as fast as lightning,\u00a0and easily handed over these vicious bandits. However, he knew the true battle was with that Guardian Spirit, and this little squadron of people and horses did not account for much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They surrounded the little guy, and all of them began to talk at once as they commented on what just happened.\u201cLittle guy, you\u2019re so awesome. You defeated these people with just a single strike! Not even that leader who knew a flame precious techniques could withstand it.\u201d\u201cWhen will I be able to kill roaming bandits like cutting grass?!\u201dOver ten people had been dispatched. Shi Feijiao and the others were not lenient with them and threw them them into the mountains to feed the ferocious beasts. These vicious bandits\u2019 hands had been dyed in blood. Letting these people go would be the same as punishing the good and nurturing evil, and only more people would suffer.As for these mounts, some were too vicious and untameable, so they were immediately killed to become food for the people of Stone Village. As for the ten other ferocious beasts who were relatively docile, they became mounts for the villagers.\u201cHaha, you made a great accomplishment. These beasts are all good mounts. The only trouble is that they are savages that need to be fed blood and meat every day.\u201dShi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others were very happy. Although they have never ridden on unicorns, having a group of fine ferocious beasts as substitutes right now was pretty good as well.These vicious bandits\u2019 mounts would naturally not be too bad, and they were the most suitable for leaving and entering the great wasteland. Although each of them had a bloody mouth, fierce teeth and dense scales all over, they were truly powerful. Once they were tamed, they would become fine mounts.The red sun began to set in the east, and the villagers were all very happy. They began to boil those ferocious beasts which had been killed within a large fire until their meat became soft. They were supported on top of a bonfire until they were roasted golden, and the oily meat fragrance made people drool with desire.They ate large mouthfuls of meat while discussing their gains for the day. Those evil bandits which assaulted them were executed, allowing them to shed their resentments and finally vent out some of the choking anger they had for the past few days.\u201cIt\u2019s truly delightful. We don\u2019t know how much disasters these vicious bandits made in how many little tribes. I don\u2019t feel an ounce of guilt after killing some of them today.\u201d\u201cLittle guy, you were incredible. When you handled that leader, you easily broke his terrifying flame technique. It\u2019s truly remarkable. Out little milk drinking baby is getting stronger and stronger, haha\u2026\u201dA group of adults laughed heartily as they ridiculed little Shi Hao.\u201cCome, uncle has specially boiled a jar of beast milk for you. Drink up.\u201d A middle aged with a shaggy beard scooched over.The little guy was very embarrassed but very skillfully raised that jar and poured it into his mouth. However, as soon as a drank a mouthful, he shouted, \u201cLiar, this is fruit juice!\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d A group of people couldn\u2019t hold back their laughter and began to laugh wildly.The laughing stopped because the chief\u2019s expression became serious. He stood in front of the bonfire and reminded everyone, \u201cThis group of vicious bandits has been executed, but if they don\u2019t return for a long time, it will draw out their main forces and that Guardian Spirit.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, I will take care of it.\u201d The little guy stood up.After the villagers heard, they all began to worry. Although the little guy was strong, he was still a child after all. Their enemies had numerous experts and even a Guardian Spirit, making the villagers feel intimidated.What was a Guardian Spirit? They represented mysteriousness and power, demanding the worship and gifts from the tribes they protected. They required devotion and sacrifices, and were extremely difficult to deal with. No one wanted to become enemies with a Guardian Spirit.\u201cThis is an evil spirit. I\u2019ll think of a way to eliminate it!\u201d said the little guy with a determined tone. He swore in front of three villagers that he would not act simply out of bravery. If something was wrong, he would immediately escape.The unicorn, little white, would naturally follow him and rapidly carry him away if his life ever became endangered.Before leaving, the little guy suggested that villagers should evacuate first and not stay here any longer. Everyone nodded in agreement, and even the chief had the same idea, as it was tough to say whoever would win the battle tonight. In case the little guy lost, the village would immediately receive a bloody retaliation.\u201cChild, I\u2019ll go with you!\u201d The chief wanted to accompany him.\u201cNo, grandpa chief\u2019s body has some internal injuries, and you can\u2019t utilize the Bone Text at will. Just leave it to me!\u201d The little guy shook his head in disagreement.\u201cChild\u2026 We\u2019ll have to trouble you!\u201d The adults were ashamed.\u201cIt\u2019s something that I should do, let\u2019s go!\u201dIn the end, the little left rode out by himself and galloped into the ends of the earth with a heroic passion. He wanted to exterminate that group of vicious bandits by himself.He had learned where these bandits originated previously from the mouths of one of them. Right now, he was unrelenting as he charged into the great wasteland like a silver whirlwind.The unicorn was as fast as lightning as it passed over mountains, crossed over many ridges. The forest on both sides rapidly fell back as he finally neared his destination after an entire hour.Wild animals howled within the white mist in the mountains.This was a relatively elevated mountain region. There were simple fences at the place where the vicious bandits temporarily stayed. They were nomadic, and had been accustomed to this life a long time ago.The bonfire pulsed as the vicious bandits were currently eating wild animals. They were in an arrangement of three people per meal and five people per group, and as they surrounded the bonfire, they ripped their roasted meat apart while they discussed.Not far away, a group of ferocious beasts were either pinned on ancient trees or locked up beside huge boulders. They all looked extremely sinister.This was a simple mountain stronghold, and a few people kept watch on the borders as they watched out for the arrival of any vicious beasts within the mountains. After all, this was a vast wasteland, and a powerful monster could suddenly appear at any moment.The little guy rode his mount and came over as he sat atop his silver unicorn. He was like a white gowned divine general who treaded upon the skies as he arrived with a silver radiance.\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d The people who were patrolling and guarding the gates shouted loudly.\u201cLittle white, you hide first!\u201d The little guy said as he leapt off and landed on the ground. At the same time he flung away Hairy Ball who was on shoulders onto the back of the unicorn.\u201cSo strange, a little baby unexpectedly came here.\u201d The few people who guarded the gates were amazed, but they did not dare to act in contempt because the stranger the situation was, the more nervous and attentive they were.\u201cSomeone charged into the stronghold!\u201d They shouted and passed on the news inside.The little guy did not fear and took large strides forward like a general who had not lost a single battle out of a hundred. He unexpectedly held a terrifying aura and a rather outstanding might.\u201cStop!\u201d One of the vicious bandits obstructed him with a battle spear in hand as he fiercely pierced forward.Peng!The little guy raised his hand and swatted out with his palm. With a kacha sound, that battle spear snapped and he immediately flew out over ten meters away before stopping.He collided with a huge mountain boulder, and became paralyzed on the spot.\u201cSo strong!\u201d These vicious bandits breathed in a breath of cold air and quickly retreated one by one. They extended their long bows and pulled on their bowstrings as arrows streaked across the air one after another. They emitted ghostly whistles as they flew towards the little guy, and they were all vicious, accurate, and extremely powerful.Weng!The little guy drew a circle with his left hand, and it suddenly transformed into a vortex of symbols. The symbols rapidly rotated, absorbing all of these dense arrows within. They were twisted within the vortex until they became iron powder, scattering onto the ground.\u201cHeavens, a little freak!\u201d These vicious bandits were shocked. They had all experienced many bloody battles before, but they had never seen a child that was this young and terrifying.The little guy reached out with his palm, and symbols filled the sky. Those ten people who received the news and ran over suddenly flew away like straws, and their bodies immediately smashed against the boulders behind them. They spat of mouthfuls of fresh blood, and were unable to get up again.\u201cEnemy attack, prepare for battle!\u201d Sharp whistles sounded. The mountain stronghold went into a state of chaos, and all the vicious bandits stood up.The little guy did not fear at all and slaughtered his way in. He fought the vicious bandits with his bare hands without using much power, and he broken the bones of over twenty people, making them unable to fight anymore.\u201cTruly astonishing, it\u2019s actually a baby!\u201d A leader appeared. He showed a strange expression as he continuously stared at the little guy.Shi Hao took a step forward as if he was going into no man\u2019s land, and as he continued to act, an individual who saw this situation rapidly rushed over. His entire body began to shine until pieces after pieces of armor appeared and covered his body.\u201cEn, crocodile armor? No, it\u2019s armor made from the scales of pangolins.\u201d He was like a large crocodile. The plated armor on his body was shiny, malevolent, and ferocious as he walked forward with killing intent.Hong!The little guy swatted out his his palms and the shock wave sent people flying and broke their bones. Only that person was not sent flying by that huge power, and immediately crawled up.\u201cCould that be a precious artifact?\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes suddenly shined, since these types of things were rarely seen. He rapidly charged forward to take his action again.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you came!\u201d That person yelled loudly. He raised his palm to welcome that attack, and as precious symbols flickered, it made his palm shine like a beast claw.Peng!The little guy was high and mighty and did not move, however that person\u2019s palm spasmed and deformed on the spot. Although this set of armor was not bad, it was still difficult for it to protect him thoroughly, so many of his bones broke.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He was simply in disbelief over this entire event. His opponent was so young, yet he was already powerful beyond imagination. How could an ordinary child of his age possibly achieve this realm?\u201cAgain!\u201d The little guy walked forward and acted again. He wanted to test the armor\u2019s usefulness, and whether or not it was a precious armor.Hong!This time, the vicious bandit leader was immediately sent flying across the air as his other arm was broken and his sternum collapsed inwardly. Large pieces of that scale fell off, as even they were unable to defend against the little guy\u2019s huge strength.\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not a precious artifact; the symbols within the scales shattered.\u201d The little guy shook his head.This vicious bandits were all dumbstruck. This was a leader was extremely powerful, but in the face of this child, he could only last a few blows until he became a puddle of mud, unable to get up again.\u201cTrash, you people can\u2019t even obstruct a little child?\u201d At this moment, the sound of a middle aged man\u2019s voice echoed through the air. His voice was loud and clear like a golden clock as it buzzed and trembled.The little guy halted, because he knew he encountered a genuine expert. An extremely powerful symbol fluctuated in front of him, and it was as if a vicious beast had awoken from its hibernation.This person\u2019s black hair was thick and murky, and a small golden pupil rested within his white eyes. His aura was extremely rich and powerful, and with each step he took, the entire mountain region trembled as if an enormous creature was walking through.This was a genuine big boss within the group of vicious bandits who controlled over a hundred experts. His techniques were excellent, and he had a powerful Guardian Spirit accompanying him; he was not an ordinary person.Chi!A flame shined before hiding the sky and covering the earth in an instant. It immediately transformed the area into a sea of fire, submerging the little guy within.The middle-aged man suddenly took action without any superfluous words. It was the same flame technique, but it was incomparable to the one before.With a chila sound, a little stream beside them instantly evaporated, and the surrounding mountain rocks turned into magma. The place became an active volcano that bubbled and surged forth with heat that was difficult to resist.The little guy was startled. This was a genuinely great expert who surpassed his expectations. He originally thought that only that Guardian Spirit was frightening, but he did not think that their boss was this extraordinary as well.Weng!He closed his hands, and a silver moon rose. It whirled and swivelled to absorb the flames then it magnified to covered the entire area. This was the precious technique that he obtained from Zi Yun, Da Peng, and Xiao Qing\u2019s body.\u201cYou\u2019re a child from that village, yet you are actually this powerful?!\u201d The middle-aged man saw the little guy dispel his flame technique and was immediately shocked. His memory was extremely good, and actually remembered where he met the little guy.Last time he went to the Stone Village, he was riding on a vicious beast and indifferently watched from the rear without any expressions. At that time, his gaze was so keen that he unexpectedly still had a clear impression of that village.Facing this opponent, the little guy did not dare act careless. Symbols flashed, and he activated his precious technique in preparation for the next attack.At this moment, the middle aged man\u2019s entire body shined and he shouted loudly, \u201cGuardian Spirit, please bestow power to me.\u201dWith a honglong sound, his body seemed to have been ignited, and he transformed into a human shaped pangolin as bright rays of light shined around where he stood. He seemed rather pleased with his transformation, and he launched his most powerful attack.Shua!He viciously waved and a huge claw made of light streaked over the sky and grabbed towards the little guy. Sounds rumbled within the air and divine traces filled the sky.The little guy appeared solemn, and he lightly cried out to use his precious technique. A huge silver moon with a diameter of one zhang appeared behind his back, illuminating the entire area in shining luster, and like a bright divine ring, it protected him in the center.Silver splendor rose and continuously surged out of from the disk-like moon. It charged towards that huge claw, emitting the sound of a huge collision sounds before exploding into a splendid shower of light within the sky.This sight was extremely shocking yet beautiful. A silver divine moon was behind the little guy, and it enveloped him in a hazy pure and holy radiance as if he was a little Deity.Across from him, that man shaped pangolin shouted and said, \u201cIf I massacred your village last time, perhaps there wouldn\u2019t be so much trouble now. Did you just made a breakthrough recently?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d The little guy did not deny it. Three volcanic craters surging with magma appeared out of thin air. That was the divine essence that poured into his body.\u201cWhat?\u201d The powerful middle aged man was shocked. Having three Heavenly Passages right after making a breakthrough was unheard of. It was like the Arabian Nights, so terrifying that it scared people.\u201cI never could have imagined such a peerless genius would appeared in this savage land!\u201d The middle aged man shouted. After transforming into a man shaped pangolin, his entire body ignited with terrifying rays of light as he spoke. \u201cI truly should have slaughtered that village a bit sooner.\u201dThe little guy\u2019s gaze was deep, and behind him was a precious shining silver moon which sprinkled out pure and holy radiance, enshrouding and submerging him within. It made him seem more like a God.The two battled fiercely and exchanged ten blows in the blink of an eye. The silver moon behind the little guy suddenly trembled, and a large bird cry sounded. A huge Archaic Devil Bird appeared and rushed out while enlarging rapidly. Suddenly, it became omnipresent and covered the entire mountain area.Pu!The Archaic Devil Bird streaked across the sky and its claw descended. It shattered the endless symbols of the middle-aged man and tore off one of his arms along with his shoulder. It almost slice him in two as his fresh blood spilt forth, splashing onto the surface of the mountain.Ahh\u2026The middle aged man returned to his human form, and the radiance all over his body disappeared as he fell within his own pool of blood. He was extremely unwilling as his pupils dimmed and his ominous glint vanished. He said to himself, \u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating for half my life and only broken through into Heavenly Passage when I was thirty. Today, I\u2019ve cultivated for over fifty years, yet I haven\u2019t been able to break through into a higher level. You\u2019re just a baby yet you actually achieved the same level as me.\u201dHe was angry, and his expression was complicated. Against an inconceivable child like the little guy, he was extremely shocked and reconciled.The group of vicious bandits were dumbstruck as their big leader who they normally revered as a God was defeated, and he even had one of his arms forcefully torn off by a child who appeared seven to eight years old. It was shocking to the point that it made them tremble.Hong, Hong\u2026The mountain floor shook, and an enormous light golden monster appeared. In the darkness of night, it seemed like a splendid gold mountain that transformed the ground into gold.That Guardian Spirit appeared, and it had indifferent eyes that looked like two golden lanterns. Terrifying radiance circulated all over it as it stared at the little guy with astonishing killing intent.The little guy was very calm and fearless as he said to himself, \u201cGuardian Spirit ah, mysterious, powerful and holds many secrets. I have never killed one before.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was astonishingly enormous, and it was over ten meters long as it coiled there. Its pair of golden eyes were extraordinarily indifferent, and its killing intent was incredibly severe.Such a huge Guardian Spirit made people\u2019s hair stand up just by looking at it. Coldness emitted off its back, making one wonder just what kind of powerful strength it had within that golden mountain-like body.The little guy had a calm expression without joy nor concern. He silently watched as he prepared to enter a shockingly gargantuan battle!This pangolin looked as if it had taken over 10,000 lives, and a bitter smell of blood directly wafted over. All of a sudden, a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood appeared, and it was strange and terrifying.\u201cIs it starting?!\u201d The little guy concentrated and stood in place as he withstood this mental attack.These scenes seemed incredibly genuine. Tribes were exterminated one after another, and everyone was massacred. Corpses covered the fields, and there were bloody pools everywhere, dying the earth in a sea of scarlet.It was like hell. Any ordinary person would have weakened on the spot.This little guy\u2019s expression was extremely concentrated. This Guardian Spirit was truly not simple, and its body contained an extraordinary ability that could record all these things. It caused huge shocks as it emitted its aura that making everyone\u2019s heart palpitate.The enormous pangolin moved, and the entire mountain surface began to tremble. Its over ten meter long body began to circulate with a glaring splendor, emitting a golden splendor that dyed the mountain boulders, forest wood, and falling leaves in a light gold.A haze spread over the mountain floor as a powerful killing intent surged.Honglong!Suddenly, the pangolin moved, and like a vast golden ocean, it shook and created large waves of earth. It rushed forward, and its body was surging violently. In just a split second, those ancient trees were snapped within this golden wave before flying off into the distance. The mountain rocks suffered the same fate as they flew into the sky in chaos.This scene was astonishing, and it was like a raging wave beating again the shore. Mountain boulders and huge trees all snapped as they rose high into the air before exploding within this golden aura.In the distance, the group of vicious bandits all shuddered. Seeing this scene that seemed like a clash between heavenly powers, their cruel temperaments all vanished, and they were all shivering.A large golden claw several zhang long reached out and swatted towards the little guy. Its shockwave exploded the mountain rocks and grinded the trees into fine powder. Its dazzling splendor and might was astonishing.The little guy did not dodge. With a swing of one arm, he could display a divine strength of 108,000 jin. Now that he had broken through, when he added the mysterious force of the symbols, it was even more terrifying. He lifted up his hand, and it stiffly shook.Peng!His little hand was covered densely in symbols as it collided together with that huge claw. Radiance that overflowed into the heavens exploded in an instant as it engulfed towards all four directions.Trees snapped, and rubble flew into the sky. Those vicious bandits who stood in the distance flew away like straw as that terrifying golden wave consumed the entire area.When it finally calmed down in the end, the little guy had only backed up a few steps. His divine strength could be rated as world shocking. He was forcefully fighting against this enormous golden pangolin, but he was not at a disadvantage at all.That golden pangolin pupils exposed an inquisitive luster. It was not an ordinary Guardian Spirit, and its roots were great as it was a descendant of an ancient Horned Dragon; it\u2019s flesh was powerful and dauntless.Hong!The pangolin moved again. It fiercely rotated its body and swept across with its golden tail, destroying everything as if they were rotten wood and withered grass. On its way, it encountered a 100,000 jin boulder, yet it was immediately smashed apart.It was excessively powerful and fierce!The little guy was not reckless and did not forcefully fight against this. His body was as agile as a butterfly as he fluttered backwards, moving along with this frantic shockwave.The golden tail annihilated everything, and as it smashed into a few more boulders that weighed over tens of thousands of jin, they seemed weak in the face of its power. The instant it stopped, the little guy moved in to take advantage of the situation. He reached out with his little hand, and grabbed onto the tail\u2019s scales. He hugged onto it, and then crazily began to make a swinging motion.\u201cWhat?\u201d In the distance, the eyes of that group of vicious bandits almost popped out as they saw such a huge Guardian Spirit actually being moved.The little guy held its tail with all of his strength and began to rotate it. With a hong sound, he smashed it against a mountain wall. Huge rocks began to drop downwards, and submerged it within shocking momentum.Although it was possible because he took advantage of the situation, he still displayed a crazy and unbelievable strength. This was only a child who was seven to eight years old.\u201cIt he\u2026 The child of an Archaic Vicious Beast\u201d\u201cIn the ancient era, the young of those Leopard Dragon or Taotie who could fight against gods weren\u2019t this excessive either! This is only a savage land and a little small village. How could such a terrifying child show up?!\u201d The boss of these group of vicious bandits exposed a fearful expression.Peng!Many rocks weighing between thousands to tens of thousands of jin flew in the air as that golden pangolin crawled back up. It did not suffer the slightest injury, and it did not care at all. This kind of attack would have a hard time destroying its solid scaly armor.It was a Guardian Spirit, mysterious and powerful. How could it simply be defeated by a human? It was far from being heavily injured.The pangolin rushed forth to fiercely battle with the little guy. With its fierce force and huge body that possessed an extremely powerful strength, every time it swatted down with its huge golden claws, its intense aura was enough to collapse a small mountain.However, the little guy actually received each blow. He weaved left and right as he jumped, and stiffly collided with that golden Guardian Spirit. Dazzling splendor exploded between these two as their auras oppressed everyone around them.\u201cBattling against the descendant of the bloodline of an ancient Horned Dragon with the flesh alone, this is simply like a legend. He is still simply a child.\u201d The boss felt as if he was going crazy, because the things he saw with his eyes simply did not seem real.One big, one small, these two living beings exchanged hundreds of blows during their intense fight without a decisive outcome. The group of vicious bandits were all foolish because how could a little ignorant child battle with a Guardian Spirit? If they were not viewing this personally, they would have never dared to believe it!Suddenly, the pangolin got up and stood in place. Its divine splendor sprinkled everywhere as its powerful aura seemed to have been invigorated several folds. It actually behaved like a human; its claw arm was agile and its hind legs were like human legs that could shift and turn nimbly.Shua!That claw hacked down and the little guy dodged. However, it immediately raised a leg and swept across. It was as if a great master released his most terrifying attack, rapid and ruthless.The little guy was in midair and could not dodge. Both his hands stiffened to block its leg, he was still sent flying.However at this moment, the Guardian Spirit turned its as fast as lightning. Like a Horned Dragon swinging its tail, that enormously large golden tail immediately swept across the sky and lashed out.Peng!Even though the little guy\u2019s arms were crossed and blocked his front side, the attack solidly struck in in midair, causing his entire body to fly out and directly collide into a mountain wall.A human shaped hole immediately appeared. The wall cracked, and rocks tumbled downwards astonishingly.The little guy spat out a mouthful of bloody foam and forcefully shook a bit before splitting the rocky wall right open. He struggled free from within, and his eyes became even brighter as he became more wary and attentive.The golden Guardian Spirit\u2019s body was enormous, but its movements were extremely sharp without any clumsiness or stupidity. This kind of agility greatly contrasted with its body shape.Shua!It quickly turned its body and then ferociously leapt and pounced towards the little guy. This was an enormous creature over ten meters along, if this attack made contact, the mountain would collapse and the group would split.The little guy was startled as he indeed underestimated this Guardian Spirit. Symbols flickered, and he rapidly rushed out from within the mountain to evade the attack.After the golden pangolin\u2019s vicious attack missed, it changed its direction and suddenly stretched across. As it stuck forward, it had the intention of crushing the little guy within the mountain wall; it really was a ferocious and angry strike.This was too fast. Like a streak of golden lightning traversing across the sky, the Guardian Spirit\u2019s movements were quick and violent, and its fierce and tyrannical actions were as fast as fire .The little guy\u2019s body was full of symbols as he stuck against the mountain wall. Like a gecko, he rapidly moved about and advanced ten meters instantaneously.With a honglong sound, the golden pangolin leaned against the rocky wall and did not not cram the little guy within. It shook the mountains until it began to rumble and tremble, and enormous cracks began to appear within it.The little guy was very decisive and immediately dove down. He was like a young divine bird that was stretching its wings in flight. Soon after, he descended quickly, and with a peng sound, he stamped on top of the Guardian Spirit\u2019s head.His strength was extremely powerful. He was able to lift a 108,000 jin boulder in the past, let alone that severe kick right now. He smashed apart the golden scales on the spot, causing that Guardian Spirit\u2019s blood to pour out.There was no choice but to admit that this pangolin was simply too powerful. Its skin was rough, and its meat was thick. If it were any other experts, their skulls would have long been shattered by the little guy\u2019s kick and immediately die. However on the contrary, it wasn\u2019t hindered much, and as it fiercely shook its head, the golden symbols began to burn, causing the little guy to fly out.\u201cSo powerful!\u201d The little guy was shocked. This Guardian Spirit was extremely terrifying, and was a whole level stronger than what he had imagined.Symbols flickered, and precious techniques flew forth from time to time as these two fiercely exchanged blows. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged another hundred blows. The long longer they fought, the more the little guy became fearful since he had suffered a few heavy blows. Apart from encountering a heavy strike from that golden tail, his back had been scratched by the claw, and he almost had his spine smashed. The little guy was bloody all over as he spat out another mouthful of fresh blood.This Guardian Spirit was savage and powerful, so it was extremely hard to deal with. Furthermore, the little guy felt this Guardian Spirit had a big problem within its body; otherwise, it would be even more terrifying.The golden pangolin naturally did not have a petty origin. Perhaps it came from a not so small tribe. How else could it be this mystic with a bloodline that seemed so mystical?\u201cIt\u2019s suffering from a secret disease. Otherwise, I\u2019d have no choice but to run.\u201d The little guy muttered to himself.He also took lightning like actions, and injured the Guardian Spirit. His attacks were truly powerful, and the strength of his flesh was better than even that world-famous pangolin. He broke off many of its scales, however, it was still difficult for him to inflict any serious injuries.Suddenly, with a weng sound, a terrifying shockwave quaked, and a golden drizzle of light filled the skies. The atmosphere was terrifyingly scary, terrifying everyone into trembling.The little guy\u2019s hair immediately stood erect as a chill was sent down the back of his spine. That golden drizzle of light weren\u2019t petals, but rather the golden scales of the Guardian Spirit. Unexpectedly, it instantaneously shed all the scales on its body and activated such a terrifying attack.\u201cThis is its precious artifact!\u201dThe little guy was frightened because all the scales on its body were precious. They transformed the skies into a golden shower, and it was splendid and beautiful. However, the killing power was astonishingly great, and it was actually a terrifying golden storm.He rapidly shifted horizontally to dodge. The precious artifact was showing off its power, and it was truly terrifying.It was clearly visible that when the rain of light sprinkled down, the mountain and cliffs immediately became riddled with bumps and pits, and bright holes that were pierced through appeared one by one!Although the little guy was extremely quick, he could not fly into the air and escape into the ground. The dense golden scales covered the sky and cut off the path in front of him.\u201cActivate!\u201dHe shouted loudly and his arms shined. Two silver precious moons appeared and collided together to rapidly combine into one silver millstone to protect himselfi.The silver millstone rotated, making it possess a powerful absorption force that drew in the golden scales before grinding them up.However, this was a genuine precious artifact, so it was impossible for them to truly be smashed apart; otherwise, how could they be called precious? Only part of the golden scales were temporarily suppressed.Another part danced in the breeze as the rain of light filled the sky and made pu pu sounds. In the end, the little guy could not avoid all of it. Three pieces of golden scales penetrated his body, making three bright bloody holes appear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, the attack did not injure the heart or the brain; otherwise, he would have immediately lost his life. The little guy\u2019s entire body was covered in blood, as this battle was extremely difficult. However, he did not retreat in fear, and only stared forward.After being injured in succession, the little guy was also angry. However, his eyes were clear and he did not lost his calm. He was still searching for the Pangolin\u2019s weakness, and he would strike it at the most opportune moment.The golden colored rain fluttered about freely, becoming increasingly bright and resplendent. As whistling sounds were created, it was as if meteorites were falling from space, extremely beautiful yet terrifying.The little guy dodged, however, this drizzle of light was too dense and omnipresent, and it completely submerged him within!This type of attack was terrifying to the utmost, and it pierced through nearly everything. Each speck of light was like a sharp golden colored scale as they pierced through mountains and cracked open gold. There weren\u2019t many obstacles it couldn\u2019t overcome, and if it struck any parts of the human body, it would certainly leave behind a bloody cavity.With a wenglong sound, the little guy withdrew his silver disks, and activated an extremely sturdy defense. Silver splendor shone over his entire body, constructing a unique divine moon on his back.This was an incomparably divine silver disk, and it was almost as if a silver-colored flame was burning. He stood in the middle, and he was incredibly divine and awe-inspiring, as if he was a miniature God.Chi, chi\u2026The rain of light gushed out before pouring downwards. Endless scales glittered in air as they tried to penetrate that divine moon to pierce the little guy\u2019s body.The divine moon sank and floated. It wasn\u2019t very big, but it perfectly shrouded the little guy\u2019s body within. Silver radiance circulated about, preventing the drizzling light from reaching his body.It was blocked!However, this was extremely passive move, as this type of defense wastes an extremely large amount of essence energy. If this went on for too long, the little guy would die of exhaustion. Even three volcanic craters weren\u2019t enough to continuously support this technique.After the Pangolin shed its body of golden scales, it became completely naked all over. It looked somewhat malevolent, but at the same time, since the little guy was going to get pierced rotten soon. Its eyes were squinted as they emitted a chilly light, waiting for the end result.Suddenly, right when that Guardian Spirit began to feel at ease, a terrifying shockwave erupted, and that divine moon exploded. Holy splendor began to rise, shaking loose all of its golden scales into every direction, making them unable to concentrate together for a short period of time.After that, the little guy charged forth as he rapidly streaked across the sky. His ten fingers was spread out as he pointed towards the Guardian Spirit, throwing the Heavens and the Earth into disorder.With a weng sound, a mist was emitted from between his fingers, and an incredibly splendid golden lightning hacked out like a destructive ray of light towards the Guardian Spirit\u2019s head. It staggered back a bit as its skull was almost split apart. Its fresh blood bubbled and surged almost as it almost fell head first into the ground.This was too sudden. The little guy was clearly at a disadvantage, yet he suddenly managed to produce such a severe counter attack. It was outside of the Guardian Spirit\u2019s expectations, and almost caused it to die.The little guy used his most powerful precious technique, and it was the precious technique he obtained from the bone of the Suan Ni. He had already meticulously studied it for many years, and he had an astonishing and profound level of comprehension since long ago.The Guardian Spirit was in rage. All the scales on its body flew out and it had no protection. After being struck by this golden lightning, it suffered an extremely serious injury, and began to emit a stinky burning smell.Before this, it almost thought that even if the little guy had more techniques, it would not be too powerful. Therefore, even if it was in a crisis, it could still rapidly recall its scaly armor and initiate its defense.It was overconfident. The little guy was constantly waiting for this opportunity, and was ready at any moment to burst forth during the most crucial point with his fatal strike.The astonishingly powerful golden scales that seemed like a drizzle of light fluttered in the breeze. For the little guy, it was both a calamity and an opportunity. If the Pangolin was protected by its scales, it would be difficult for him to get past his defense. However, as soon as the scales left its body, it instead turned into the best opportunity to strike!He immediately seized this opportunity, as he didn\u2019t want to forfeit this battle!Kacha!Golden-colored lightning danced about, and the little guy boldly and ferociously charged forward. Although he was nearing exhaustion, he still exploded with the might of a thunder God. The area became densely packed with lightning, and they all landed upon the Guardian Spirit\u2019s body.Finally, that scorched black body began to sway back and forth, shedding off large chunks of blood, exposing the flesh and white bones within. The might of the electricity was so astonishing that it heavily wounded the Guardian Spirit!Aooo..The Pangolin bellowed angrily. This little enemy was actually so crafty, unexpectedly hiding this kind of skill in order to activate it at the most crucial moment, causing it pain and regret.It opened its mouth and hissed. Symbols filled the sky as it recalled the golden scales. However, even if it was fast, it was not faster than lightning. During this moment, more rays of lightning lined up and descended upon it. The strike caused its body to fly out, smashing several bones within his head and burning it black. Pretty soon, even its inner organs would be injured.A chill creeped out from the bottom of the Guardian Spirit\u2019s heart. It never expected the little guy would be so difficult to deal with. The most incomprehensible thing was that he grasped the Archaic Descendant Suan Ni\u2019s precious technique; terrifying mists of light that resonated like lightning.Qiang!After seeing the Pangolin recalling its scales, the little guy activated another supreme precious technique. A silver moon lifted into the sky with an Archaic Devil Bird in the middle, chopping towards the Guardian Spirit.With a pu sound, flesh and blood splattered across. This strike was world shaking. The explosion of silver splendor and the sweeping attack of the devil bird almost sliced the Guardian Spirit in half.Finally, the drizzle of light turned around and returned back to the Pangolin\u2019s body. The sound of keng qiang echoed through the air as golden light circulated and covered its body beneath to protect its flesh and blood.After it steadied its figure, it produced a world shaking roar that trembled the entire mountain, making huge boulders tumble down. It angrily gazed at the little guy with a killing intent that overflowed into the heavens.The little guy was not scared, and continued to activate his lightning. Rays of electricity erupted from between his fingers, and golden symbols filled the sky as it pressed downwards.Hong!The sound of thunder was deafening as his the golden aura submerged this entire area. Its might was unblockable. The little body was covered in golden rays of of electricity, and he was like a God of thunder descending upon the earth as he continued this vicious battle against the great Pangolin.The scales on the Guardian Spirit\u2019s body all emitted light, however, many of them were still blasted apart, causing fresh blood to drip out.In the distance, the scalps of the vicious bandits went numb, and they were scared to the point that they were trembling all over. Their most powerful Guardian Spirit was at a disadvantage, and this was so hard for them to take in that the scene felt illusionary.\u201cDie!\u201dA divine incantation sounded, and the golden Pangolin became angry. Its skull shone as it opened its mouth to spit out a lump of light. It was so bright that it was difficult to see with one\u2019s eyes. This was strange yet terrifying, and it unexpectedly released loud bursts of sound, as if dragons were chanting and flood dragons were hissing.This entire area cooled down. The most important thing was, those bitter scenes that he saw at first were recreated. One tribe after another were exterminated as their corpses laid across the earth, dying the entire area in a scarlet red.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201dClose by, the little guy finally saw something clearly. It seemed like the Guardian Spirit\u2019s upper and lower jaw. They were the hardest part of its body; otherwise, how could it penetrate mountains.What was especially shocking was that these two golden bones were connected, and the light rays they emitted were simply too astonishing, practically eclipsing the sun. Moreover, they did not pierce forward, but rather sliced towards him like a pair of scissors with the intention of cutting him apart at the waist.The hairs on the little guy\u2019s body stood erect as he felt the threat of death approaching; this shockwave of this power was too frightening. He did not decide to resist it head on, but rapidly dodged instead, shifting his body to the side in an instant.Kacha!These precious golden scissors charged forward, and actually directly snipped that huge mountain over a hundred meters tall in half. It caused the upper half of the mountain to rumble and drop down.Its power and might was absolutely astonishing!The little guy breathed in a breath of cold air, since this precious artifact was too strong.Furthermore, this golden bone gave people a terrifying sensation that surpassed the Guardian Spirit itself. Those scenes of many tribes being exterminated and corpses being spread everywhere were all being reflected in this bone.\u201cThis\u2026is not its own precious bone. It\u2019s the bone of another descendant who is even more powerful!\u201d The little guy keenly discovered the anomaly.This golden scissor was formed by two pieces of golden bones, and they were emitting a flourishing splendor as they dazzled the eyes. The golden color was so thick that it couldn\u2019t be dispelled, and it far surpassed that Guardian\u2019s bones, as its body was only a light gold.\u201cIt\u2019s refining and raising this golden bone, forcefully reviving it.\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes exposed a strange light. This pair of golden bone scissors were extraordinary, and it was not something that an ordinary person could use.He felt that this should have been left behind by a purer-blooded and even more frightening Pangolin king, and had no idea how this Guardian Spirit obtained it.\u201cIts ambitions are not small. It wants to resurrect this golden bone and allow its own body to undergo rebirth, but in the end, it damaged its own life source.\u201d The little guy realized and finally understood why this Guardian Spirit was strange. It was obviously very terrifying, but it could not utilize part of its power.Perhaps this was an opportunity. This bone contained so much aura of slaughter and killed so many things. For the sake of refining it, the Pangolin practically broke its own life source and almost died.Because of this, its vital energy now suffered a huge injury, and was far weaker than it had formerly been. If he took advantage of this opportunity, the little guy might be able to eliminate it in one move, and it was far easier than fighting it at its peak by many times!\u201cLet\u2019s determine this with a battle to the death!\u201d The little guy shouted. Although his face was young and tender, hi he had a strong fighting intent, and his vigor was flourishing.He wanted to fight as if his life depended on it, and he no longer hesitated to fight this bloody battle. As long as he killed this evil spirit, then that mysterious and powerful bone scissor would change owners, and he would obtain a rare and precious artifact!However, the Pangolin was truly too strong. How could it be so easily handled? It opened its mouth and hissed as symbols filled the sky. The golden scissor spun and sliced forward yet again.The sounds of dragons chanting and flood dragons hissing were vaguely audible, and the might was astonishing. Whether they were huge rocks or vegetation, as long as they were touched, they would immediately be sliced in half without suspense.The golden bone began to emit light, and the figure of a dragon emerged. Due to the fact that the Pangolin originally already had the blood of a Horned Dragon inside, it was able to display some of its power. As a descendant of ancient times, the precious bone\u2019s original owner must have been incredibly terrifying. The appearance of this Horned Dragon was incredibly shocking.With a honglong sound, the little guy disappeared from his original position. Naturally, he would not forcefully defend against this attack, as the precious artifact was too terrifying.Bewildering mist suddenly emerged from the entire mountain surface, rapidly covering the forest within until it was pitch-dark and indistinct.He activated the Suan Ni\u2019s precious technique, and not only was there lightning, there was also smoke. This Suan Ni\u2019s inherent divine abilities allowed it to hide its own body as it confronted its enemies with thunder and lightning.The Guardian Spirit went crazy. Within this thick mist, it constantly used its precious golden bone scissors to cut across the forest, snapping off many large boulders and trees. It made a few short mountains meet their end, instantly cutting off their upper portions.This made people dumbstruck because the bone scissor was too astonishing. As long it wanted to, it could even cut off the peak of the mountain. It was very worthy to be a mysterious precious artifact.The little guy was very calm and he hid his body within the mist. He continuously moved his body and changed his position, waiting for his opportunity.Evidently, this bone scissor consumed a lot of energy. Even something as strong as this golden Guardian Spirit could not continuously tolerate it. It only activated it a few times, yet its body unexpectedly swayed and almost fell onto the ground.It was extremely furious. He obviously sensed that the little guy was in front of him and activated its precious scissor to cut him down in one strike, yet his attacks always missed.The Guardian Spirit stopped moving and carefully responded. The pair of bone scissors rested atop his head, ready to strike at a moment\u2019s notice. Stands of divine splendor dangled down from the precious artifact, and its killing intent made people tremble every single direction.A human figure flashed and appeared behind it. The Guardian Spirit\u2019s eyes were ice cold, yet it did not turn around. The precious scissor on its head directly flew over, and with a kacha sound, that person\u2019s body was instantly cut in half. His fresh blood spilt out, and his wretched screams resonated within the forest.The Pangolin was angry because it knew it killed the wrong person. That was only a vicious bandit whom its opponent had thrown over.It quickly went back to defense, but it was too late. A streak of terrifying light beam shot towards it, and it was like a divine lance that penetrated through the skies as it pierced into its chest.Chila.A burnt smell was produced, and its scales and flesh were cracked open on the spot. Chunks began to fall off, exposing its bones.In the distance, the little guy held a precious mirror the size of a palm that was overflowing with colors. It was polished and made from a sparkling precious bone that contained astonishing might!It was precisely that piece of precious bone that he obtained from between the Suan Ni\u2019s brows during that time. Through many years of nurturing, it was transformed into a precious mirror that possessed a terrifying divine might by the little guy.Since he had grasped the opportunity, he naturally would not let it slip by. The little guy raised his hand, and with a honglong sound, another streak of splendid divine light shined forth like a sharp sword chopping downwards. This time, it struck towards the weakness of the Guardian Spirit.ly when the Pangolin used its light drizzling technique, it was scaleless, allowing the little guy to capture that opportunity. The lightning had cracked apart several of its bones, and because of that, it was already suffering from a heavy injury.The light emitted from that sparkling and translucent bone mirror was also a type of lightning. It was incredibly brilliant, and its might was astonishing as its attacked was like that of a Thunder Deity\u2019s!Those few pieces of bone immediately fell off, and the Guardian Spirit suffered heavy internal injuries. It emitted a world-shaking bellow, as it never could have expected that those insect-like humans were so powerful. If given the opportunity, it would definitely begin a crazy slaughter.It rapidly turned the golden bone scissor around and attacked towards the little guy with the intention of eliminating him.The attack already unfolded, how could the little guy make any mistakes? A complicated and mysterious symbol appeared on the bone mirror within his hand. It emitted the most splendid and flourishing light as it shot through the Pangolin\u2019s innards.Pu.Its inner organs were smashed after the Pangolin encountered the most critical attack, and it was no longer confident that it could preserve its life.After the little guy succeeded, he retreated and did not fight anymore. He quickly ran away and hid within the mist.After a the light trembling of a weng sound, the golden bone scissor streaked across the air, slicing off even the mountain ground. The Guardian Spirit went mad as it searched for the little guy. However, it only showed its terrifying power, and could not find its opponent.The little guy\u2019s eyes were bright and clear as he hid in the darkness. His hands held the warm and humid sparkling bone mirror as he hid, preparing his final fatal blow.However, without even waiting for him to act, the Guardian Spirit released a wretched scream as a shocking change happened to it. Its entire body cracked open as golden symbols flickered about. After a peng sound, it unexpectedly cracked apart.Its ambitions were too great, and it continuously tried to refine and nurture that precious scissor hoping that it would shine with life again to go against heaven\u2019s will. Naturally, it failed, and also harmed its own foundation. After experiencing a large battle, its body completely exploded.Pu.The Guardian Spirit disintegrated and died tragically on the spot. A golden light flashed past, and those golden scissors fell from the air and onto the mountain floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite all the heavy injuries he suffered, he rapidly rushed over.On the mountain floor, the mysterious and powerful pair of golden bone scissors were circulating with a hazy and precious splendor. It laid across the rubble as it emitted a force that made people\u2019s heart palpitate.\u201cIt truly is a terrifying precious artifact!\u201d The little guy was overjoyed as he picked up the precious scissors up, and he held in within his hands, turning it about as he observed it.After shrinking, it was only the size of a palm. Its entirety was a golden yellow, and its splendid light was dazzling. Needless to say, this was a rare treasure with a value that was difficult to quantify.As it sat within his hands, its weight surpassed all the metals within this world. It was created from the bones of both the upper and lower jaw, however if one did not observe carefully, they would not have recognized this. Due to the polishing and nurturing it had undergone, its was sparkling and translucent, and had already gone through great changes a long time ago.In reality, it was extremely beautiful. It looked as if it was forged meticulously by an outstanding master who imbued all his heart and soul into it. Two vivid and lifelike Horned Dragons that seemed as if they appeared straight out of legends intertwined togetherThe pair of bone scissors did not look that sharp, and felt incredibly smooth as well. However, it was astonishingly terrifying in battle, and it could easily cut a mountain peak in half.A few mysterious patterns were embedded on the golden bone. They were indistinct and also very ancient. They were precisely the terrifying Archaic Vicious Beast, the Horned Dragon, but they were not symbols, but rather simply a beautiful decoration.\u201cThe scene of tribes being extinguished was indeed created by that creature.\u201d The little guy activated it just a bit, and he once again saw the scene where corpses laid across the lands. This bone scissor\u2019s origin was astonishing.Without a doubt, this was a great murderous device. Otherwise, how could it create such massacres? If these scissors were used against the enemy, nothing would remain uncult.The little guy tested it out once again, and the precious scissors flew out. With a weng sound, a rocky ridge in front of him was instantly cut in half. Seeing it left him dumbstruck, since its power was truly too great.However, there was a disadvantage to it. Just this single strike had consumed a large amount of the little guy\u2019s essence energy, leaving his body exhausted as he staggered.\u201cThe consumption is too great. I can\u2019t use it easily,\u201d the little guy said to himself.No wonder the Guardian Spirit had to expend such a great deal of effort to use this precious artifact. Using it several times had caused its body to tremble, triggering its hidden disease and ultimately completely splitting its body apart.\u201cI\u2019m not a Pangolin, and this bone did not originate from the same species as me. There\u2019s no need for me to go against heaven to resurrect this golden bone, so I\u2019ll just treat it like a rare precious artifact. That way, I won\u2019t hurt my own body.\u201dThe little guy\u2019s eyes were very bright as he fondly admired this precious scissor. For him, this sparkling and sleek golden bone artifact did not harm him in the slightest; on the contrary, it could protect him.With a xiu sound, the bone scissors transformed into a streak of golden light and entered one of the \u2018volcanic craters\u2019. The magma undulated up and down as it hovered within, and it was being nourished by the essence energy of the world. It was put away by the little guy just like that.Mist began to spread out, and the mountain surface gradually restored its peace and clarity. A silver moon suspended overhead, and the ground was full of potholes. Desolation reached as far as the eyes could see, and all the nearby trees were destroyed.A painful groaning sound echoed from the distance. When the little guy battled with the Guardian Spirit, the entire mountain surface was practically razed. Naturally, the group of vicious bandits were injured in the impact.Especially since the Pangolin was so enormous, each time it attacked or used its precious artifact, rubble would fly into the sky and smash into many people. At least twenty to thirty vicious bandits were killed.When the clouds and mists dissipated, the state of the battlefield was clear. The group of vicious bandits stood up from behind the huge boulders in the distance and gazed over. They could not help but feel chills all over their bodies as they were all left dumbstruck.The Guardian Spirit lost and died within the mountains!To them, it was as if a legend had been shattered, as ts attack power was too great. One must know that this Guardian Spirit was like a god to them that would always prevail, but just now, it was killed by a little child.\u201cYou\u2026 Killed the Guardian Spirit. An Archaic Vicious Beast that reincarnated in human form!\u201d These people all shouted loudly with fright shrouding their faces.Their faces were ashen, and their bodies were trembling. They lost their Guardian Spirit, so how were they going to survive within this great wasteland now? They would undoubtedly die.Each and every one of them believed that their Guardian Spirit would prevail and devour this child as food. They absolutely did not believed they they would see such an inconceivable result.\u201cYou\u2026 What do you want to do. Do you want to kill us?\u201d A vicious bandit shivered. When they killed people normally, they did not feel much. However, when the same fate fell on them, they similarly became scared.\u201cThe troops we sent out, were they all killed by you?\u201d They were terrified. This was just a child, yet he killed thirty to forty of their people before searching them out to kill their Guardian Spirit and wipe them out. Even thinking about it was scary.At this moment, the little guy was just like a demon within their hearts.\u201cI did not kill those people, and I don\u2019t plan on beheading you guys one by one.\u201d The little guy calmly said.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Those people were surprised, and they were immediately mad with joy. Surviving was more important than anything else.\u201cThose thirty or forty people are all still alive?\u201d The boss showed a peculiar expression.\u201cNo, they are all buried within the stomachs of wild animals.\u201d The little guy answered.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Everyone\u2019s expression changed, but they understood immediately. This was a child who could not bear to see blood, so he did not personally act. However, there was no way he would let them go.\u201cGrandpa chief said that being lenient toward evil people is the same as letting them continue to act as they please, so only more people will die.\u201d The little guy gently said as he raised his wrist.A string of sparkling and translucent beast teeth appeared, and each tooth was transparent. They were as white as jade, and this was the first precious artifact he had obtained. It used to belong to the Guardian Spirit of the Wolf Village.Chi, Chi\u2026Air splitting noise sounded, and 42 specks of light as pure and white as jade flew out towards those people. With pu pu sounds, blood splashed into the air as many of the vicious bandits were crippled, losing all of the essence energy within their body.\u201cAh, No!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThey were alarmed, scared and afraid. For them to lose battle strength in this great wasteland was equivalent to pushing them to hell. How would they defend against fierce beasts?The boss wanted to escape, which made the little guy re-prioritize his focus. Snow white bone teeth flew out, twisting themselves around him. Exerting some strength to make a twisting motion, he completely obliterated the symbols within the body.\u201cNo, don\u2019t do it!\u201dHowever, everything was too late. In the blink of an eye, over ten people fell onto the floor. They whimpered and panted heavily as their hearts were brimming with terror.From the moment the little guy entered the mountain until now, he defeated many people, but he did not kill anyone. He let them go with their lives and allowed the great wasteland \u2018purify\u2019 these evil people.\u201cI want to know where you people are from and whom you are working for?\u201d The little guy started his interrogation. He wanted to know what kind of terrifying powers these vicious bandits were working for in the end.At first, the bandits were not cooperative, but in the end, they confessed everything.\u201cLittle Western Sky\u2026\u201d The little guy muttered to himself. The vicious bandits spoke this name, but what they knew was limited. They were only acting under the orders to search for the Supreme God\u2019s Treasure. It was rumored that it had already appeared, and they were collecting a lot of black gold for the sake of breaking through the ancient spell symbols.There were more than a single group of vicious bandits, but they were the only group of bandits that truly possessed a powerful Guardian Spirit. This Pangolin came from that Little Western Sky!After resolving everything, the little guy\u2019s tense nerves finally loosened. He sat his buttocks onto the earth, directly laying down on the spot.His mind and body were both exhausted, and there were many bloody holes within his body. His spine almost snapped, and his entire body was bloody and bruised all over. During this battle, his injured were extremely severe, yet he held on until now.The Guardian Spirit died, and that group of vicious bandits lost their battle strength. The little guy was completely relaxed as he laid there motionlessly, and did not want to get up again.Symbols flickered as they automatically healed him as he made some painful groans. This battle was truly dangerous. He practically threw his life in and almost died here.He had exchanged hundred of blows with the Guardian Spirit, and he relied on his powerful willpower to hold up until now; he was finally able to relax now. He had stopped bleeding a long time ago, and his innards made pi pa sounds. His flesh was being reconstructed as his body was gradually rebuilt.Zhi Zhi\u2026Hairy Ball appeared and pointed towards the distance. What it meant was \u2018I have taken control of all the bandit\u2019s mounts.\u2019It saw that the injuries of the little guy was extremely severe, so it grabbed its ears and scratched its head. It could not help but release a wretched scream, and what it meant was \u2018I need to let out blood again? I\u2019m so unlucky.\u2019\u201cStop pretending to scream, it\u2019s not like I asked you to use your precious blood to save me.\u201d The little guy wrinkled his nose as he spoke, and took out a jade jar from his bosom. He retrieved from the jar a precious pill that emitted a sweet fragrance.Hairy Ball immediately began to scream exasperatedly. It jumped and scuttled up and down while making gestures with its little claws.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t scream anymore. I\u2019ll admit this is refined using your blood, but it\u2019s only leftovers from before.\u201d The little guy guiltily explained.With a gu lu sound, he swallowed the precious medicine. Instantly, essence energy surged all over his body as the medicinal pill immediately dissolved, mending his wounds with a divine effect.Hairy Ball was extremely annoyed and scuttled over as he snatched away this jade jar to pour its contents into its own mouth. However, it found that the jar was empty, and angrily shouted before immediately throwing the jar far away.\u201cHairy Ball, that medicine was refined using your own blood. Why do you want to eat it too? Otherwise\u2026when we returned, we\u2019ll make another batch?\u201d The little guy asked in a discussive tone.Zhi Zhi\u2026 Hairy Ball clenched its little golden fist and exaggeratedly rolled its eyes at him to show his disdain. Even if you kill it, it wouldn\u2019t have agreed.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAfter an hour, the little guy stood up enthusiastically once again. Three \u2018volcanic craters\u2019 appeared, and \u2018magma\u2019 dripped outwards onto his body, replenishing his energy.Many mounts were also crushed to death by the flying rubble, and only thirty to forty remained. It was enough to carry the enormous cracked body of the Pangolin, which was a precious item that he could not leave behind.\u201cHairy Ball, you should deal with these vicious bandits.\u201d The little guy commanded.After walking out several li, the little guy encountered the chief who quickly ran over with a face full of anxiety and worry.The little guy\u2019s heart was very warm. The chief was extremely worried because he had not seen him return for a long time, and was prepared to fight with his old life.\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m over here.\u201d\u201cChild, you\u2026 nothing happened! That\u2019s simply too great!\u201d The chief was very excited. When he saw over ten vicious beasts carrying the crack golden Pangolin body, he was even more flabbergasted.\u201cKilled\u2026 That Guardian Spirit?!\u201d\u201cI killed it!\u201d The little guy nodded.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The chief laughed heartily as tears dripped out of his eyes. He was incredibly happy and pleased, since he felt that this child had really grown, and was able to soar into the distant horizon now.They returned together, and ran into another group of adults after walking another ten li. This was precisely the group of able-bodied men composed of Shi Linghu, Shi Feijiao and the others. All of their eyes were red, and they had an attitude that seemed as if they were going to fight for their lives.\u201cWhat? You killed that enormous Guardian Spirit!?\u201d The group of men were dumbstruck then they all began to laugh loudly.Their nervousness and worry were immediately swept into the wind as they brought the spoils of war back to the village. At this time, Stone Village was extremely quiet. Apart from them, everyone else had evacuated.\u201cHurry, chase them through the night and call them back.\u201dFor such a great happy occasion, they naturally could not wait for daybreak. They wanted to let all the villagers know, so that their hearts would not be worried or anxious.\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m going to sleep first.\u201d The little guy slept extremely soundly. When he woke up again, it was already evening on the second day.At this moment, the fragrance of meat in the village assailed the nostrils as they talked and laughed. All the villagers had returned, and splendid smiles hung on each and every one of their faces.All of these aunties and grandmas were grinning from ear to ear as they sorted out the Guardian Spirit\u2019s flesh. The stewed meat within the pots, and they emitted a weak multicolored light. The essence energy was so abundant that it was even a bit scary.The children were running back and forth as they clamored and shouted. This was the meat of a Guardian Spirit. They had not even dared to think of this before, but today they get to gorge themselves with it.\u201cLittle guy, you\u2019re truly powerful. You\u2019re actually capable of killing a Guardian Spirit.\u201d A group of children scooched over and surrounded little Shi Hao. All of them were incredibly emotional and excited.\u201cLittle big bro, so strong. You have to teach me well in the future.\u201d Qingfeng\u2019s large eyes brightened with admiration.As for the adults, their feet felt incredibly light, and they could not feel any more joyful. The Guardian Spirit meat which contained a lot blood essence must be handled well, since these were all precious items that were difficult to come by.Roasted and boiled meat was only a small part of the benefits. The majority of the meat and bones were refined together together with old medicines to achieve an even better effect. It would be greatly beneficial for all the villagers, and improve their physiques by a large amount.Even the village elders were busy the entire day. The most precious blood and muscles were all personally sorted out by them.Hunting down a golden Pangolin was like obtaining a great treasure for Stone Village. If they used it well, it would have an tremendous effect.During the entire night, all of the villagers were incredibly joyous. Cheers and laughs resonated everywhere, and they surrounded the bustling bonfire while eating the fragrant Guardian Spirit meat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were talking about how in the future, they would definitely become heroes who would lift cauldrons and overturn mountains, and their might would tremble this great wasteland.Of course, the person everyone praised most was the little guy. Shi Linghu roared even louder, \u201cChild, you\u2019re not young anymore. In a few months you\u2019ll be eight years old, and your skills are great as well, so you should have a marriage set soon. How is my family\u2019s little Hu girl?\u201dThe little guy was greatly embarrassed and said, \u201cUncle, I\u2019m still young.\u201dShi Linghu widened his eyes and said, \u201cNonsense, you\u2019re not small. Uncle got married when he was 12 years old, and I was far weaker than you were at that time. According to your skills now, you could have done it a long time ago.\u201dThe group of children all began to laugh as they winked at the little guy.Shi Linghu glared at them with an eye and said, \u201cWhy are laughing. You guys aren\u2019t young either, and it\u2019s about time to consider it too. That\u2019s right, Dazhuang, Er Meng, and Pi Hou have rapidly improved during the past two years and have powerful skills. They ought to marry as well.\u201cThat\u2019s right, they all all at that age.\u201d A village elder nodded.\u201cAh!?\u201d The children all cried out in alarm with embarrassment, and their faces were illuminated rosy by the reflection of the bonfire.These words were not considered much for the others, but the little guy was unable to hold his own. Because behind him, there were a few young girls who were after him.\u201cGrandpa and father said that me and you should engage. When are you going to agree?\u201d Shi Feijiao\u2019s daughter asked in her loud voice.\u201cI\u2019m still young. I don\u2019t want to marry!\u201d The little guy scratched his head while his face started to heat up.On his other side, the Hu daughter with braided hair was even smaller than him. Her pair of arms was crossed at his waist and her eyes were brightly as she also shouted, \u201cLittle guy, when are you taking me as wife?\u201d\u201cWhen did I say I\u2019ll marry you?\u201d The little guy almost ran away from home as he truly could not hold out for much longer.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d The adults all began to laugh heartily.\u201cChild, what\u2019s your plan?\u201d In the end, the chief smiled and asked the little guy.\u201cI want to send Qingfeng to Heaven Mending Pavilion and cultivate on our journey there. Didn\u2019t grandpa say reading ten thousand Bone Books isn\u2019t worth a journey of a hundred thousand li?\u201d The little guy replied.\u201cHowever, you\u2019re still a bit young. The journey is too long and remote, and none of us knows the direction to Heaven Mending Pavilion.\u201d The chief was concerned.\u201cChild, don\u2019t rashly make a decision.\u201d The other elders advised him to be cautious.Little Shi Hao nodded and said, \u201cEn, I know, I\u2019ll wait for Willow Deity to wake up. He told me that he\u2019ll take me into a secret world to look around. Furthermore, I\u2019m don\u2019t feel at ease either. What do we do if another band of roaming bandits appear.\u201dDuring this night, all the villagers were enjoying to their heart\u2019s fullest content as they ate until the depth of the night. In a loud and arrogant voice, they told mysterious tales about the great wasteland, greatly fascinating the children.The only regretful thing was that the Pangolin self-destructed at the last moment, and so its primitive precious bones as well as its scales were destroyed. It did not leave behind any precious techniques.During the latter half of the night, Stone Village was still not at peace. The children howled like ghosts and shrieked non-stop as they gluttonously ate many pieces of the Guardian Spirit\u2019s meat. Their entire bodies were shining, and they were irresistibly hot and dry as well. In the end, they all jumped into the lake to cool themselves.The elders cleared warned them that everyone could eat at most two pieces and they cannot treat it as a meal. However, such a situation was still created in the end.At daybreak, a group of children as well as adults crawled out from the lake with bags under their eyes as they they dejectedly returned to their own homes.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Some villagers woke up early and burst into laughter when they saw this scene.Without a doubt, this Guardian Spirit was very extraordinary, and contained a great amount of essence within its body. Its body could be said to be a precious medicine that could effectively improve the villagers\u2019 physiques.That time when they accidentally obtained the corpse of the Suan Ni, the villagers ate the entire thing. The villagers\u2019 physiques obtained an enormous benefit, otherwise, how could a group of children all cultivate in the Bone Text?One must know that it would be tough to find one person in a tribe of 10,000 who was an expert in the Blood Transformation Realm, yet these children all had an opportunity to break through in the future.Clearly, the body of the Archaic Descendant had an enormous effect, after all, they were incredibly difficult to find, and were considered priceless treasures. If a top-notch tribe wanted to obtain one, their entire tribe might be exterminated if they were even slightly careless.This was because the Suan Ni is not an ordinary Archaic Descendant!Although this Guardian Spirit did not compare up to the Suan Ni, it was not ordinary either. It roots were large, and originated from the mysterious Little Western Paradise. The Wolf Village\u2019s Guardian Spirit was absolutely incomparable to it.In reality, the Pangolin should have had even more battle power than it showed. It was only because that it had been nourishing and resurrecting its golden bone scissor that it suffered huge damage to its body which lead to its defeat.In the blink of an eye, half a year quickly went by, and the enormous Guardian Spirit was obstinately cleaned up by the villagers.The children\u2019s power advanced by leap and bounds, and their proficiency in the Bone Text deepened. These results shocked the elders, but in the end, they all could not contain their smiles;, and almost pulled out their white beards from stroking.Apart from the children, a few adults also erupted, such as Shi Linhu and Shi Feijiao. In fact, they had been cultivating in the Bone Text for a much longer time than the children had, since the chief taught them the Bone Text when he returned from the outside world. However, they their golden years of cultivation, so their accomplishments were not ideal.During these few years, it was first the world shocking precious corpse of the Suan Ni, and then there was an extraordinary Guardian Spirit. Their corpses all contained great amounts of divine essence that enormously improved their physiques.Therefore, their many years of cultivation and accumulated experience had gradually erupted forth. Shi Linghu and Shi Feijiao entered the Blood Transformation realm; their levels were not low, and their cultivations were profound.People could not help but lament. The Archaic Descendant\u2019s corpse as well as the mysterious Guardian Spirit of the Little Western Paradise were indeed extraordinary and worthy of being called rare and precious flesh medicine. \u00a0No matter what others tried to exchange for them, they still would be rejected.Another few months passed by, and the Willow Deity\u2019s year of hibernation was almost up. Today, the little guy was eight and a half.Within this long period of time, the little guy had refined the Guardian Spirit\u2019s flesh into precious medicine and applied onto himself. He then opened his fourth \u2018volcanic crater\u2019 behind his back. \u2018Magma\u2019 flowed, and divine essence surged mysteriously\u201cSo slow, I\u2019ve only gained one more and it\u2019s been almost a year.\u201d The little guy muttered to himself as he felt his cultivation was gradually becoming more difficult.When the chief heard these words, he was speechless. After a while, he finally wiped away his cold sweat, and told him that this level was already incredibly miraculous. Many people wouldn\u2019t make even a inch of advancement in their entire lives. Even if one\u2019s natural talents were extremely high, they would not be able to take another step into heaven for many years.\u201cIs that right? Then I\u2019m relieved.\u201d The little guy happily smiled, and no longer frowned.Heavenly Passage was the process of establishing an immortal passage between a person\u2019s interior and exterior. It was a pure land, and it was a world that connected one together with the endless void to seize the world\u2019s fortunes. It made the divine strength of the symbols within your body explode, constantly maintaining its peak proficiency.According to the chief\u2019s statement, little Shi Hao was already considered a great expert of the Heavenly Passage realm, and had already established four immortal passageways.\u201cSome people would have one passageway throughout their life, and use it to absorb the power of the Heaven and Earth. However, even if they could step into a higher realm, they would still have difficulty reaching the peak, and their accomplishments would soon reach their limit.\u201d The chief gave a long explanation.When ordinary experts established four or five \u2018Heavenly Passages\u2019, they would consider whether or not to accumulate energy. By doing this, they could one day explode with the surging force of the Heavenly Passage\u2019s endless divine symbol strength, and push themselves into a higher realm.The chief explained a step further and said, \u201cAble to establish six Heavenly Passages is considered a powerful figure within this realm, and people who are able to establish seven Heavenly Passages would inevitably be considered geniuses. People who are able to establish eight Heavenly Passages would naturally be rare heavenly gifted geniuses as rare phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. People possessing nine Heavenly Passages would typically only exist within an ancient text\u2019s legends. If a person liked that appeared in reality, he or she would certainly be considered a heavenly-warping divine talent.The little guy blinked his large eyes as he carefully listened to everything. It turned out that he could actually consider breakthrough into an even higher realm, but he would never make this choice now.According to the chief, each opened Heavenly Passage would unlock some more potential. If one Heavenly Passage gave one bundle of potential, then two Heavenly Passage gave two potentials; when one possessed eight Heavenly Passages, then there would be a huge disparity!Time passed by. After the vicious bandits were exterminated, none of the other roaming bandits appeared, and Little Western Paradise also did not have much of a reaction. Perhaps they thought that the Pangolin was buried within the stomach of an Archaic Descendant in the great wasteland.During this time, Stone Village once moved out to dig out the black gold accumulated by the vicious bandits. Although it only totaled to roughly half a meter squared in area, it still weighed tens of thousands of jin. This was a precious material used to construct military weapons, and it was also a metal that could be used to control mystical formations. It was very rare, and them being able to gather half a meter squared clearly show just how much massacring they had done over these years, and how many lives they had taken.After half a month, cool breeze brushed by gently, creating ripples within the green jade lake. A willow tree that had been silent for a year at the village entrance suddenly bursted into light. Its green magnificence overflowed into the heavens, enshrouding the entire mountain range in a hazy halo of light.\u201cAh, Willow Deity has awakened!\u201dThe villagers cried out in alarm and was then overjoyed. Their Guardian Spirit had resurrected, so they no longer had any reasons to worry in the future. Even if a powerful descendant invaded on them, they believed the Willow Deity would still be able to stop them.At this moment, whether it was male, female, old or young, everyone ran over and piously sacrificed and prayed to the willow tree.Kacha kacha.The old bark was shed off, exposing a new protrusion that was flourishing with green multicolored light as a new plump and tender, greenish-blue branch poked out. Instantaneously, dense light fogged up as 10,000 strips of colors shot forth.The willow tree was reborn, and four more branches shot out. They rapidly matured until they were over ten meters long, and had the same appearance as the previous branch.The five willow branches were sparkling green like an orderly divine chain as it emitted precious light as it enshrouded this entire land. It was mysterious and enigmatic with an extremely shocking shock wave.The villagers were overjoyed, because the Willow Deity was even more powerful and splendid now. That burnt black body had a parts of it restored, and with a greenness that was full of vitality, jade-green light was dispersed, covering this entire land in a thick lively atmosphere.\u201cWillow Deity\u2026you\u2019re okay?\u201d Some elder said in a trembling voice.\u201cI am very well. I\u2019ve been hibernating for a long time.\u201d Willow Deity said and restrained its divine light. Then, the green light retreated from the mountains like the tides, and the mountain ranges returned back to normal.During this day, Stone Village celebrated and was incredibly lively. With Willow Deity here, they never had to worry about the revenge of those vicious bandits again.\u201cYou did well by slaying that Guardian Spirit. It was not simple at all, and had transcended the Heavenly Passage Realm. Fortunately, its foundations were shattered; otherwise, you would have be in danger.\u201d Willow Deity clearly understood what had occurred from seeing the remaining few bones of the Pangolin.\u201cWillow Deity, I had already established four Heavenly Passages. After hearing grandpa chief\u2019s \u2018potential theory\u2019, I want to open up an even greater potential.\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes shone with the radiance of desire.After exchanging a few words, the willow tree understood clearly. Its few willow branches swayed as if it was gently shaking its head. \u201cIs eight Heavenly Passages the peak? This is only the standard for humans. Nine Heavenly Passages were not merely recorded within ancient legends, they truly do exist.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d The little guy cried out in alarm and earnestly consulted.\u201cAccording to the situation in the ancient era\u2026\u201d When the willow tree just spoke, the little guy immediately understood that this would certainly be another comparison within the realms of the supremely powerful Archaic Vicious Beasts, and that this was a terrifying comparison.Indeed, the willow tree continued speaking and said, \u201cDuring the ancient era, Taowu, Vermillion Bird, Taotie and the others believed that in the Heavenly Passages Realm, nine passages would make them a king but ten passages would be the peak. Only then would one be considered the sovereign of this realm.\u201dThis little guy was astonished. This statement was absolutely terrifying, since it far surpassed mankind\u2019s current prevalent standards.\u201cBeing in the great wasteland is too restrictive, and it would be rare for you to meet any truly powerful geniuses, and would be even more impossible for you to fight a battle of life and death against powerful creatures like the youth of a true hou. Staying here would only prove detrimental to your cultivation.\u201d\u201cWillow Deity, do you have any ways?\u201d The little guy understood what the Stone Village Guardian Spirit meant.\u201cI once said that when I awoke, I would take you to look around within a mysterious world. Are you willing? Maybe you can meet your \u2018little big brother\u2019 Shi Yi in advance, although it would not be a true meeting.\u201d\u201cI am willing!\u201d The little guy resolutely nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let the villagers know so they don\u2019t end up worrying about you, and then we\u2019ll head out!\u201d spoke the willow tree. Like a thunderclap and breezing wind, as soon as it finished talking, it was going to head out.\u201cOkay!\u201d The little guy did not ask any more either, and immediately turned around. He rushed into the chief\u2019s courtyard to quickly and simply inform him of the situation.Shi Yunfeng and a few other elders were all stupefied. Shi Feijiao and the others who came after hearing the news were astonished, and all began to sweat in nervousness for the little guy. What kind of place was that?! To actually be able to fight against Qiongji, Bifang, Jiaotu and the young of other beasts as well as perhaps even encountering the dual pupiled Shi Yi, even hearing this was astonishing.\u201cChild, you have to be careful. What kind of place is that to actually be able to encounter the children of Archaic Vicious Beasts? You have to pay attention to your own safety!\u201d\u201cThis kind of training is too terrifying. Is this a trial by fire for the children of Gods?!\u201dThey were all completely shocked, and their hearts were full of worry.The little guy was very blunt, and quickly returned after informing the villagers without the slightest delay. He then immediately sat cross-legged in front of the burnt black tree trunk with a solemn expression, as he had already completely his preparations for the journey.\u201cVery well then, then let\u2019s open the path to heaven,\u201d the willow tree said. Although its voice was gentle and calm, it had a certain dignified feeling to it. Its five branch ferociously and explosively expanded, and then turned into bright and orderly divine chains as they pierced into the heavens.With a hong\u00a0sound, green multi-colored light flourished splendidly and turned the world into a sparkling green. Five gorgeous willow branches pierced the dome of heaven, as if they were opening a gate into the very natural laws themselves!Within the sky, there was a dense yet bright fog. The entire area was covered in the haze, and it was mysterious and profound.A weng sound slightly trembled, and the little guy felt as if he was leaving his original land. He passed by that bright and hazy gateway, and as he traveled through, he entered a bizarre world.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d The little guy discovered that he was surrounded by a hazy fog, and it was as if the primal chaos was surging all around him; everything around around him seemed indistinct and muddled.\u201cCome here!\u201d A lump of gently green light shone, and the burnt black willow tree appeared in front. It rooted itself within this world, and beckoned the little guy to walk forward.The mist dispersed, and the scene gradually became spacious and void, and it seemed incomparably desolate and ancient, as if this was a piece of an abandoned world.\u201cIt looks like an abandoned ancient world.\u201d The little guy was surprised.The mist thinned, and he gazed forward into the large ruins while standing under the willow tree. One huge palace after another, collapsed and only broken ramparts and ruined walls remained.\u201cGo take a look,\u201d the willow tree said.The little guy took a step forward, and he only saw a desolate area. There was debris all around him, and the once magnificent Palaces were completely destroyed, and there was an ancient and distant aura, as if everything had transformed over time.\u201cWhat kind of place is this?\u201d The little guy inquired once again.\u201cVoid God Realm.\u201d The Willow Tree answered.\u201cVoid God Realm?\u201d The little guy\u2019s heart trembled. As soon as he heard this name, he knew this place could not possibly be simple; otherwise, why would this place bear such a name.\u201cThere was once a rumor that this was the world one entered after becoming God.\u201d The willow tree said\u201cAh?!\u201d The little guy was shocked. He entered the God Realm himself? This kind of feel was surreal to the point of being a little scary.\u201cOther people claim that the supreme beings that the first natives worshiped \u2014 the Gods, combined their efforts and used their minds thoughts to construct this strange world.\u201d The Willow Tree described a different theory.\u201cThe Gods that the first natives worshiped combined their efforts to create this spiritual realm?\u201d The little guy widened his eyes as he felt that such events were truly unfathomable.He lowered his head to take a look at the ruins beneath him, and then he gazed toward the broken Archaic mountains. He that outrageous at just how real this world was.\u201cMy true body is obviously standing here. If this world was constructed out of spirit, would my body be capable of standing here?\u201d asked the little guy.\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I need to correct. Your real body is not actually here right now, and it is only your spirit\u2019s will that is here,\u201d the willow tree reminded.The little guy could not believe it, and he pinched his own arm, immediately feeling a burst of pain. This wasn\u2019t a dream realm, yet it was not fake either, as he could clearly feel how real it was.\u201cFor any life form, it is the spirit that is the most mysterious, and it far surpasses the flesh,\u201d explained the willow tree. \u201cHaving your spirit entering here is like experiencing a rebirth. It\u2019s not actually much different than if your real body was here.\u201d\u201cThis is my will, it\u2019s not really my flesh. How could it feel so real? It\u2019s so hard to differentiate between the two.\u201d The little guy was baffled.\u201cThis is precisely the mysterious aspect of the Void God Realm, and it\u2019s also where its value lies. When your spirit gets trained here, upon returning to the real world, it will bring everything that the spirit learned back into your flesh, transforming together. It\u2019s the same as if your had your real body train here!\u201d spoke the willow tree as he guided the little guy along the right path.\u201cSuch a strange place!\u201d The little guy gasped in surprise.When he stepped on to the rubble, there were kacha kacha sounds. The ruins were enormous and empty, and far more boundless than any of the distant mountains. Even though everything had been destroyed, it still made people feel as if the area was sacred and majestic.If these were all constructs made of spirit, how much divine power would it take to create all this?!The willow tree sighed again, \u201cThere\u2019s a legend that there was once a great turmoil, and it eventually even lead to the destruction of this spirit world, resulting in the creation of these ruins.Among the deities that the first natives worshiped, some perhaps really were Gods, and some were pure-blooded Zhujian, Chiwen, Yayu\u00a0and other ancient creatures. That was an extremely complex and mysterious era.\u201cAm I supposed to train my body in this spiritual world? There\u2019s nothing here. This place had been abandoned a long time ago.\u201d The little guy was very puzzled.\u201cYou are incorrect, this world is vast without borders. What you you see is a mere corner of it.\u201d Willow deity corrected and informed him that there were other vast regions, and numerous creatures dwell in those areas..\u201cWhat kind of creatures are they?\u201d The little guy was curious.\u201cThe same as you. Their spirit had entered from the outside world, and came into this Void God Realm.\u201d The willow tree answered.\u201cThey can enter as well, and there are a lot of them?\u201d The little guy was astonished.\u201cRight, it\u2019s just like a genuine country,\u201d the willow tree replied.Subsequently, the willow tree explained the next step about how those people entered, \u201cYou\u2019ve once heard of the event regarding the entire country sacrificing to the heavens.\u201d\u201cEn, I know.\u201d The little guy nodded.\u201cFrom the distant past until now, some ancient countries believe that the ancient Gods have died a long time ago, yet they are still offering sacrifices to them and the entire country following suit solemnly and piously. There are many reasons behind this, and the main reason is to inherit the things that the Gods left behind\u2026\u201dBeing able to enter the Void God Realm is one of the \u2018treasures\u2019 that the ancient Gods had passed down. As long as the people firmly believed and the entire ancient country conducted sacrificial ceremonies each year, then their experts could be able to sense the Void God Realm.\u201cIt\u2019s that mysterious?\u201d The little guy\u2019s heart was emotionally stir. His eyes were clear as he pondered for a long time, because he felt that he had gained quite a bit of knowledge just now.The willow tree then said, \u201cGood fortune is granted after an entire ancient country sacrifices and gets recognized. When their people cultivate to a certain degree, they are then able to advance their comprehension, and enter the Void God Realm.\u201dStone Village was located within the great wasteland, and was very far from the ancient country. They did not conduct any sacrifices to the heavens, so entering the Void God Realm was naturally impossible.When the willow tree brought the little guy in, it was not with the ancient countries\u2019 method; therefore, they had not met anyone else, and appeared in this piece of desolate ruins.\u201cIf you walk out from here, you\u2019ll soon reach the real training ground,\u201d said the willow tree. It stopped advancing and halted here.Just like this, the little guy went on the journey by himself and \u00a0stepped out of this boundless ruins. There were still many questions within his heart, but the willow tree was still very vague and did not tell him about everything, however, it did inform him that all the answers could be found in front of him.The mists gradually decreased as he gradually approached a brighter world. In the end, the little guy walked out of the ruins and stepped onto a huge limestone that flickered with symbols. It even had a few sparkling white beast bones embedded on top.\u201cIs this a primitive precious bone? It looks so rare and precious.\u201d The little guy was amazed as he squatted down to touch it with the intention taking it out.Shua!However, without him even making a move, a golden passageway appeared, immediately shifted him away.This was a strange feeling. The little guy found out that he was travelling back and forth, and as he left his original position, another place that was densely covered in symbols instantly appeared.This was a similar limestone that had a circumference of one zhang. This rock also had a few precious bones embedded on it as it circulated with the mysterious power of the symbols.This time, he breathed in a deep breath of air and squatted down to rub that bone. Then, he ferociously used his strength with the intention of shattering the rocky surface to take that bone with the symbols out.This limestone was very strange and extremely hard. Furthermore, these bones simultaneously shone, and constructed a mysterious pattern to defend this place.\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing? Why does he want to destroy the passageway?\u201d\u201cHeavens! He\u2019s trying to dig out the precious bones from the limestone. So outrageous! Could it be that he doesn\u2019t know that this is a passageway that cannot be shaken at all?\u201d\u2026The sound of bustling noise and discussion echoed through as this place became livelier.The little guy was stunned and quickly stood up. The symbols by his side gradually dimmed, and he was able to clearly see the surrounding situation. A group of people were currently surrounding the limestone and pointing at the little guy.\u201cHe\u2019s so young. No wonder he doesn\u2019t know anything and wanted to destroy the passageway to the outside world by digging out the symbol bone.\u201d\u201cNo matter how you say it, it\u2019s still outrageous that he did such a thing. Did his parents not inform him what to do after entering the Void God Realm?\u201dThe little guy scratched his head since he felt that he might have done something stupid; otherwise, why would these people stare at him this way? He spoke in a little voice, \u201cDo the precious bones belong to anyone? I didn\u2019t know that, so I did this.\u201dThose people were speechless.\u201cDid your clansmen not explain to you the situation here? Upon arriving in the Void God Realm, one will first arrive at this \u2018starting land.\u2019 After cultivating to a satisfactory level, one needs to draw support from the symbol passageway to proceed onto a high leveled area. After arriving here, you had nothing better to do than to find out what this passageway is made out of? Moreover, you even tried to dig out the precious bones, truly\u2026\u201d A thirty year-old middle aged man shook his head\u00a0and\u00a0he\u00a0patiently explained a bit. He felt incomparably speechless.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dAll the people nearby burst out into laughter.The little guy\u2019s little face flushed red in embarrassment as he asked in his little voice, \u201cIn other words, these precious bones don\u2019t belong to anyone?\u201dEveryone\u2019s laughter spontaneously halted as they felt shocked all over. After saying all that, he still wanted to dig the bone out?\u201cHeavens, this child is truly outrageous, and he still has ideas about the precious bones!\u201d\u201cWhose family\u2019s child is this. How did they teach him? Could it be that they raised him in a forest?\u201dThe group of people did not know whether to laugh or cry. They felt like they were facing a primitive person. This little thing looked so silly and adorable, how could he have such a behavior?What clan does he belong to in the end? If his identity was discovered after returning to the real world, his clan would certainly become a laughingstock. What happened today was such a fantastic story!\u201cIsn\u2019t this a world created by the spirit of all Gods. I feel like these precious bones would certainly have an enormous value. I\u2019m not greedy. I only want to dig them out to examine them.\u201d The little guy tried to justify himself in his tiny voice.It truly made people speechless and no one knew what to say to him.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Finally, the people could only burst out into laughter. Even if this place was the starting point, and was not the higher level paradise of the Heavenly Passage, it was still not a place anyone could destroy at will.An elder began to laugh and say, \u201cThese symbol bones are extremely rare and precious. If you can dig them out, I am willing to exchange a lot of spirit coins for them!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could this little thing not know. Could he actually have ran out from within a primitive forest?\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s talk after you dig out that precious bone.\u201d That elder\u2019s brows emitted a shady look.\u201cOh, alright!\u201d The little guy nodded powerfully. He entered the Void God Realm precisely for the sake of training and studying.According to the Willow Deity, the stuff that appeared here would have a corresponding model in the real world. He was born within the great wasteland, so he was extremely sheltered and did not understand much about the outside world. This was the perfect opportunity to learn.\u201cHow could he not even know what a spirit coin is?\u201d After even more people heard the news, they rushed over. They looked like they were surrounding and watching a strange creature as they pointed from not far away.The little guy tapped and pounded it a few times, and he was currently squatting on the large limestone that was roughly one zhang in circumference. He was studying those few pieces of symbol bones, and he had an extremely concentrated and serious expression on his face.\u201cOutrageous! Does he truly want to dig out the precious bone embedded within the passageway? I\u2019ve never seen such a person like this before!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this kid a bit too much of a miser? I want to see exactly just how he digs it out. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone doing these kind of things before.\u201d\u201cHaha, he\u2019s indeed foolishly adorable. Whose child is this? Did he come here just to put on a show?\u201dThe group of people sat nearby and watched on as if they were watching a comedic performance. To have such an idea, this child was a bit overly greedy right? If he was an adult, then he would have long been looked down in disdain a hundred times over. Right now, the people could not help but laugh, as they felt that his actions were simply too foolish.\u201cChild, do you need a tool? Uncle will lend you one.\u201d A middle-aged man squinted his eyes and smiled with a ridiculed expression.The little guy did not even raise his head and immediately received the others\u2019 goodwill as he crisply said, \u201cI do. give me a 20,000 jin hammer.\u201dEveryone was dumbstruck because this was too excessive. That was a hammer, not a thatched room. Who would be bored enough to make one that big, and would he even be able to swing it? Moreover, he was still so young, yet he immediately asked for a 20,000 jin hammer after opening his mouth. How much overestimation towards oneself and self-confidence did one need to be able to say such a thing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have one that weighs 20,000 jin, but I have one that weighs 2,000 jin.\u201d The middle-aged man threw over a little hammer the size of a millstone that immediately smashed a large part of the surface.\u201cI\u2019m afraid of breaking it.\u201d The little guy still had not raised his head as he stuck his little butt out to ponder and research that large limestone about those few symbol bones.Why was\u00a0this child speaking this way? The middle-aged man\u2019s face turned grim since he felt he had been ridiculed in return and said, \u201cNo problem, you can use it. You don\u2019t have to pay if you break it.\u201d\u201cOh, okay! Then I won\u2019t be too courteous.\u201d The little guy scratched his head and finally, as if he had thought of something else, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Uncle! Isn\u2019t this a spiritual world created by the ancient Gods? How can you have a hammer, could this also be your spiritual will as well?\u201d\u201cGo, go and do your foolish actions. you were the one that wanted a hammer. If I let you use it, use it. Where\u2019s all this rubbish coming from!?\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s brows emitted a shady expression.\u201cOkay then.\u201d The little guy did not pursue the issue, and he felt rather apologetic. After all, it was merely a question, and these people were simply too skimp on the details. Why couldn\u2019t they just kindly give out a few pointers?Little Shi Hao jumped off that big limestone and lifted up that hammer.A white-bearded elder kindly reminded and said, \u201cChild, being able lift up a weapon does not mean that you can use it very well, because that requires at least ten times more strength. You have to be careful and not hurt yourself.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d The little guy nodded, then stared at that bright winged bird on his shoulders and asked, \u201cOld man, this bird is you as well right? You transformed like this.\u201d\u201cGo, go and do your foolish actions!\u201d The elder swung his sleeves and his face darkened as well.\u201cWhy are they all like this? Why can\u2019t they just patiently give me a few pointers.\u201d The little guy grumbled. Although he was extremely quiet, every one else still heard it.\u201cThis naughty kid!\u201d Many people all said this after hearing him ask so many idiotic questions. Is he deliberately ridiculing us?When everyone was criticizing, the \u00a0little guy swung that large hammer and smashed down into the large limestone. With an ear-splitting dang sound, sparks began to fly everywhere.\u201cGood, he has some strength. He can really swing the thing.\u201d Some people nodded.Dang dang dang dang\u2026The next moment, everyone covered their ears. The iron hammer in the little guy\u2019s hand was like little chickens pecking rice as he continuously smashed into the large limestone. The striking sounds against metal continuously rang out, practically cracked everyone\u2019s eardrums.This was the Void God Realm, and so it truly made people feel as if they were actually there. It felt exact the same, without the slightest differences.Finally, with a qiang sound, the hammer deformed, and the hammerhead flew off from its shaft.Everyone was dumbstruck, as this little kid really had one or two tricks up his sleeves. He unexpectedly trashed this large hammer so quickly. His strength was truly not small!The little guy had a nervous expression all over as he hastily opened his mouth to say, \u201cUncle, you said I don\u2019t need to pay for the iron hammer!\u201dNo matter what was said, this was still the spiritual world. Any weapon that could transform into a spiritual form could not be too bad. He was afraid he could not pay it back.Looking at his nervous expression, everyone began to laugh. Only the middle-aged man\u2019s face was shady as he grunted in genuine discomfort.\u201cI say, child. Can you really dig out this precious bone? Don\u2019t waste our time. We\u2019re still waiting for you to show all of your capabilities.\u201d The others teased.\u201cThis is my first time entering this place so I don\u2019t have much experience and I don\u2019t know how to break it. All the uncle and aunts here, can you give me some suggestions and teach me a bit,\u201d the little guy asked.No one truly knew what to say. Who would be so bored as to break a passageway in the Void God Realm? Let alone them, even if they invited an Archaic Vicious Beast, it would not necessarily be able to break it.In reality, all of them wanted to say that the child was foolish and bored, and that was why he started to do such an outrageous thing in order to draw everyone in to watch.\u201cYoung man, keep going and use all your strength. I\u2019m optimistic!\u201d A few people were emitting some bad intent as they encouraged with their loud voices, because they wished for him to continue squandering his energy over this.A kind young lady urged, \u201cIt is impossible to break, and no human can break this. Unless you set your own record, to create a miracle within the God Void Realm would you breaking through quite a few extreme boundaries.The young lady further explained that this was a world constructed by ancient Gods, and all the Gods had thought through everything meticulously. One of their goals was to make sure that they could raise up powerful descendants here.Even though endless years have gone by, the law and order here continued to operate. If someone succeeded in smashing open any type of extreme boundary, then they would obtain a good amount of benefits.Furthermore, during this process, the Void God Realm will grant a certain degree of protection, and conceal the aura of the person carrying out their discoveries. This will make it so that the precious technique he used would not be revealed to the people around him, preserving his secrecy.\u201cThis was the \u2018starting ground\u2019. No matter how powerful your cultivation is, you can only display the power of the Blood Transformation Realm, and it is impossible to exceed it.\u201d The young lady added.\u201cAh, it\u2019s actually this mystical?\u201d The little guy widened his eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you want to break through the extreme boundaries here, you can only use the power in the Blood Transformation Realm. Despite the fact that many people here have surpassed the Blood Transformation Realm a long time ago, it\u2019s still useless.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like that!\u201d The little guy nodded and then his eyes shone as he said, \u201cIf I succeed, what benefits will there be?\u201dEveryone felt dizzy. Did he truly believe that he could make some kind of heroic feat happen? How did such a person randomly show up? No matter how he spoke, he still looked like a foolish kid who overestimated his own power.\u201cThis foolish child really doesn\u2019t comprehend anything.\u201d Another person at the curled his mouth and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll cry soon enough.\u201dMany people crossed their arms and began to laugh as they awaited for the spectacle of the little guy making a fool out of himself.\u201cI am very fast. I am planning to surpass the speed of the extreme boundary,\u201d the little guy seriously said.\u201cYou can try it.\u201d A few people chuckled and said.At the next moment, the little guy\u2019s entire body shone, and all kinds of densely covered Bone Texts appeared and enveloped this entire place.\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d Everyone fixed their gaze as they only saw all kinds of multicolored light dance in the air before quickly submerging the entire large limestone. No one was able to see the situation inside.\u201cHe is going to activate his precious technique, but why do I feel like it\u2019s not that powerful?\u201d Everyone was a bit dazzled. There were so many different Bone Texts here, forming into a curtain of bright and resplendent light.\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 Actually running. Does he really want to reach the speed at the extreme boundary? Isn\u2019t this completely unrelated to digging out the precious bone?\u201dAnd at this moment, an area of light rose around the large limestone that isolated the place from the outside world. The law and order of the Void God Realm was starting to protect the little guy.His aura immediately changed as a pair of light beams shot out from his clear eyes. He waved his fists and fiercely smashed down onto the large limestone with an astonishing might.Dong!He did not use any precious techniques, and only used the power of his flesh to strike the large limestone. With his current enormously heaven shocking strength, he smashed the surface. Immediately afterwards, a lump of incredibly terrifying and glaring light exploded.Kacha!The sound of disintegration was emitted, and the little guy was overjoyed because it was effective. When he used the power of symbols before, he discovered that the precious bones on rock would burst out with some divine patterns to protect it. After several times, he found out the less he relied on the power of symbols, the less those precious bones would rebound. Now, he was purely using the power of his flesh, and those bones were practically not shining at all to protect the large limestone.Even so, this limestone was still exceedingly astonishing. If the little guy swung his arms, let alone a piece of limestone, even a piece of divine metal would be pummeled rotten. However, even with his world-shocking 100,000 jin of strength, he could only make a little crack in the limestone.\u201cAgain!\u201dHis eyes were filled with deep divine light as he used the utmost power that he possessed within the Blood Transformation Realm to smash towards the limestone. His attacks were like raging waves beating against the shore, and the violent and domineering might shook the world. Unfortunately, no one was able to see it.Kacha Kacha\u2026Eventually, under the little guy\u2019s extreme boundary flesh strength, the large limestone with a circumference of one zhang disintegrated, and a few sparkling precious bones fell onto the ground.\u201cI succeeded.\u201d The little guy was overjoyed and quickly went to pick up those symbol bones which were pure white, lustering, and shone all over.Suddenly, those other precious bones shone and immediately flew away. Furthermore, the large limestone transformed into a drizzle of light and disappeared. This made the little guy stamp his feet and say, \u201cHey! Why are you running away, stop!\u201dIn the end, he only obtained one shining bone that radiated with splendid rays of light.The people were dumbstruck. He actually succeeded!No one was able to believe it, and their eyeballs almost popped out. How was this possible? It\u2019s has to be fake!\u201cCheater! How could a person like him possibly set a record?!\u201d A bunch of adults shouted loudly.However, the little guy\u2019s voice was even louder than theirs as he shouted in a flustered manner, \u201cHow did I only obtain only one precious bone. There were three more! Why did they fly away?\u201dNo matter how they looked at it, he looked like a little money grubber as he jumped and shouted about. All the onlookers were left speechless.\u201cMine, mine, they\u2019re all mine! Why\u00a0did they run away?\u201d The little guy shouted grievingly.\u201cDon\u2019t you have one in your hand?\u201d A person extremely angrily said since he thought it was truly unfair that this little child in front of his eyes unexpectedly succeeded.\u201cThere were originally a few more.\u201d The little guy said.No one truly knew what to say. They felt their teeth sore, stomach ache, and lungs hurt. An elderly man said, \u201cStop shouting. You attacked the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway and did such an unsettling and outrageous thing. Not being punished is already good enough and giving you one piece of precious bone proves that you succeeded.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201d The little guy scratched his head and quietly said, \u201cThen if I succeed next time as well, could I get another one?\u201dEveryone felt dizzy.

He actually succeeded, making everyone completely speechless. Where is the heavens\u2019 logic in this?!One must know that was a passageway within the Void God Realm. In the past, who dared to have the idea of hitting it? This was purely something outrageous done out of boredom. This little brat came in looking like a little money grubber, yet in the end really did come out with a piece of bone.The group of people cursed, as they had difficulty accepting this truth.\u201cThis simple-minded child could break through the extreme boundary. Why do I feel like it\u2019s a trick, yet I can\u2019t find out what part of it is fishy!\u201d\u201cEven someone like him could break the record, is there a mistake here? In a bit, I will try as well, don\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m not better than a little brat?!\u201dThe little guy held the precious bone in his hand and was wholeheartedly delighted. He examined the pure white symbol bone that circulated with splendor and shined with light. It contained powerful symbols, and just by looking at it, one could tell it was an extraordinary object.\u201cChild, did we have an agreement earlier? If you succeeded, I will use a great amount of spirit coins to trade for that bone.\u201d A grizzle-bearded elder smiled and came up to me.\u201cWhen did I agree with you? I still need to examine it myself first. No deal!\u201d The little guy refused.The elder did not give up and smilingly said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to know what spirit coins were? I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time to listen right now. I need to examine this precious bone first.\u201d The little guy did not even raise his head as if he was an immobile.This naughty child made the elder extremely angry. Earlier, the little guy was still seeking help from him, but he did not feel like saying anything. Now, he came back and voluntarily wanted to explain to this simple-minded child what spirit coins were, yet he was unexpectedly ignored.\u201cChild, on the premise that I lent you my weapon, can you consider selling that precious bone to me?\u201d A middle-aged man moved beside him.\u201cSo it\u2019s hammer uncle.\u201d The little guy raised his head.The middle-aged man\u2019s forehead displayed a shady look and said, \u201cI\u2019ll say it again. That hammer doesn\u2019t have any relationship to me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not yours? If it\u2019s not yours, why would you lend it to me. Furthermore, why are you still saying on the premise of the hammer?\u201d The little guy blinked his large eyes with extreme confusion.\u201cThis shitty brat!\u201d The middle-aged man was extremely angry and almost walked away out of anger.Everyone erupted\u00a0into laughter.Next, everyone\u2019s expressions became incredibly passionate. Although they felt that there wasn\u2019t any logic left in the heavens anymore, they still surrounded him as they all stared at that piece of sparkling symbol bone in the little guy\u2019s hand.All of a sudden, a stone tablet that was surrounded by mist emerged. A row of characters appeared on its surface. Every character emitted a dazzling light, and began to make resounding noises.\u201cSmashing apart the Starting Ground passageway, the reward is one primitive precious bone.\u201dThis row of bold yet lovely characters continuously vibrated, and were so incredibly bright that they illuminated the entire sky. Like 10,000 swords clashing, it startled everyone in the vicinity.\u201cHe truly initiated a record! The Void God Realm has already recorded it and informed everyone under the heavens!\u201d Everyone was shocked as they began to discuss with each other.\u201cThis simple-minded child instantly becomes famous and makes such a big commotion immediately upon entering this world. Truly\u2026\u201d Everyone lost their bad temper as they felt there anything was possible.The stone tablet radiated and approached the little guy. It made him extremely puzzled as he muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re still missing three bones for me!\u201dEveryone was driven made. This little miser\u2026 What kind of time was this, yet he was still concerned about that.\u201cEngrave your relevant information and complete this record.\u201d An elderly rainbow bird on his shoulder reminded him.\u201cMany thanks, bird grandpa.\u201d\u201cGo, go away!\u201d The old man was so angry that his beard rose up.The little guy scratched his head as he stood in front of the tablet. Everything felt new and odd, but he he did not know what to write. He gestured for a long time in midair without writing anything.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to write your real information. You can write whatever you want, such as what you enjoy the most or what you love the most.\u201d That kind young lady reminded him.The little guy was overjoyed and he raised his hand. He began to move the brush, and smoothly wrote five words at the very top: Love Drinking Milk the Most.Symbols flickered on the stone tablet, and the words that he wrote immediately began to radiate, and was imprinted on top, brilliant and dazzling.Everyone was petrified before immediately calming down.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d The little guy had a bad premonition.In the blink of an eye, everyone burst out into laughter, and they could hardly close their mouths. Some people laughed until their waists were bent.\u201cThis name is truly something. Hehehe\u2026\u201d\u201cFoolish kid, have you not stopped drinking milk yet?\u201dThe group of people could not stop their laughter.\u201cWhat, this is a name. Don\u2019t you fill in what you enjoy or love the most?\u201d The little guy\u2019s little face immediately darkened since this was too embarrassing.That kind young lady explained and said, \u201cWhat I meant was you don\u2019t need to write your real name. You can substitute it with your most beloved precious artifact, divine bird or fierce beast. My name here is Cai Luan.\u201dThe little guy\u2019s face was painful as he quietly asked, \u201cCan I still change it?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d Those people simultaneously answered with their resounding voices. No matter how you looked at it, they were all laughing at him.The little guy was greatly embarrassed because he truly lost so much face. After being branded by this name, how would he be able to see anyone else in the future?\u201cHurry, you\u2019re still missing another row or characters to engrave.\u201d Someone urged.The stone tablet that circulated with divine light was still in front of him, fluctuating peacefully and auspiciously while waiting for the little guy to engrave another row of characters. This time, he did not dare to randomly write as he hesitated for a long time and asked, \u201cTell me clearly what I have to write this time.\u201d\u201cWhich aspect of the extreme boundary did you break through? It\u2019s done once you write it.\u201d A middle-aged man said.This time, they actually did not laugh and awaited solemnly for his writing.The little guy directly wrote two words: Extreme Speed.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong this time right?\u201d He quietly muttered to himself.Someone nodded and said, \u201cEn, that\u2019s right. If it\u2019s true, then Void God Realm will give you a certain amount of protection in the future. After all, you initiated a record at the parting point.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something like that?\u201d The little guy widened his eyes as he couldn\u2019t sit still anymore.\u201cIf it\u2019s a lie, then you wouldn\u2019t get these benefits. Rumor has it that it will continuously take care of you, and carry out a \u2018special\u2019 type of self-tempering,\u201d filled in another person.The little guy became foolish and his little face darkened.At this exact moment, not only the Starting ground, a stone tablet even emerged within the higher levelled Heavenly Passage paradise. In every region, a dazzling splendor radiated as a few rows of characters emerged.\u201cYi, someone established a new\u00a0record!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person is it, and what extremely boundary was broken?\u201d\u2026At this moment, the entire Void God Realm trembled. No one dared to show contempt at any of the records, because it represented a domain of extreme expertise, and was worthy of everyone\u2019s respects.\u201clove drinking milk the most?!\u201dWhen everyone read these words, they were overcome with a strange expression. What type of disorderly and random name was this? Who would be so bored that they would name themselves this?\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a pervert right? Hehehe\u2026\u201d Many people began to laugh.Everyone continued to read on, and when they read the words \u2018Smashed the Starting Ground\u2019s passageway,\u2019 they immediately exploded.\u201cThat can\u2019t be right. Doing such an infuriating thing, yet he was still rewarded a precious bone! Does the heavens even have logic anymore?\u201d\u201cWho is this with nothing to do when they\u2019re full. Why destroy the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway? That\u2019s too brutal!\u201dAll the regions went into uproar as everyone cursed endlessly.The Void God Realm was boundless, but when a new record appeared, everyone would quickly pay attention because that certainly signifies a terrifying expert. That expert definitely excelled in a certain region, and achieved the extreme boundary!\u201cToo brutal. Who is this kid that infuriates humans and ghosts alike. This truly can\u2019t be forgiven.\u201d\u201cHow bored does one have to be to go so far as to break a passageway. No wonder this became a new record, because no one has ever done it before!\u201dEveryone was incessantly angry. What they could not understand the most was that the Void God Realm actually rewarded him a precious bone.\u201cThe symbol bones embedded on the passageways are rare treasures, and it\u2019s very possible that they might be the bones of Archaic Descendants. Within this world, they are extremely important.\u201d\u201cEven attacking the passageway could be rewarded with a precious bone. Then I\u2019ll try it as well!\u201dThe pot exploded in every region as many people were jealous and angry.During this day, the entire Void God Realm went into an uproar, and discussions regarding how to break the passageway arose. The weird name \u201clove drinking milk the most\u201d was mentioned everywhere.\u201cThis being a record, I feel like it is because no one was brutal enough to do such a thing. No one attacked the passageway, and that\u2019s why he was able to directly establish this record.That day, many people tried, and the sounds of dong dong arose everywhere. In the end, they all returned in low spirits after being defeated.\u201cIt\u2019s no good, we\u2019re in a higher level area. These Heavenly Passage paradise\u2019s passageways are sturdier. I think I should go try in the Starting Ground.\u201d\u201cAt the Starting Ground, the most power one could display is only at the Blood Transformation realm, so the record will be even harder to break.\u201d\u201cLower areas should be easier than the paradise right? I\u2019m planning to take a walk. I heard the reward is a bone at the Archaic Descendant level.\u201d\u201cWhat? That\u2019s so rare. If it\u2019s a rare emperor type, it\u2019d be even more heaven opposing! Let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll take a look as well!\u201dWaves after waves undulated in the Void God Realm. With a single action from the little guy, every region went into a state of unrest.At the Starting Ground, specks of light drizzled, and that piece of limestone had already recombined and recreated itself. Four pieces of precious bones reappeared on time as the passageway had been perfectly reconstructed.A group of people were all there. Among them, hammer uncle, bird grandpa and coin elder were at the front. The three went up and attacked it one after the other until they were so tired that they spat out blood; however, it was all futile.\u201cFoolish brat, are you toying with us? You really used speed at the extreme boundary to break it?\u201d Hammer uncle gasped for breath. He was a great expert at the Heavenly Passage realm, but he was unexpectedly inferior to a little brat. He almost died from exhaustion as he stood above the limestone.\u201cIt\u2019s true. I am faster than all of you!\u201d insisted the little guy. He then passed on a few \u2018secret methods,\u2019 and then naively laughed as he told them that they had to keep it a secret.An hour later, a group of people screamed wretchedly as they were sent flying by the light emitted by the limestone. Because they were all attacking it crazily, the beast bones began to shine and symbols began to interweave.\u201cMilk baby, you\u2019re lying!\u201d\u201cBrat, you truly are dishonest. Even if you beat me to death, I wouldn\u2019t believe that you ran around this large limestone with the speed of an extreme boundary!\u201dThe people were extremely angry.The little guy was like a dead duck, and even if he was killed, he wouldn\u2019t admit that he lied. Afterwards, he began to wander around the Starting Ground to familiarize himself with the surroundings. This place that showed sign of human habitation was already very vast, and in the distance was an endless and primitive forest.He felt bursts of peculiar gazes as many people peeked at him with bad intentions, but he did not pay attention to them. In the Starting Ground, no matter how high one\u2019s cultivation was, they could only display the power of the Blood Transformation realm. He did not have much to worry about.\u201cChild, be careful. Some people have ideas about beating you up for your precious bone.\u201d Bird grandpa warned.\u201cMilk kid, if you can\u2019t take it, then just sell it to me; otherwise, you will certainly be in danger.\u201d Coin elder warned.Of course, nicknames like bird grandpa, hammer uncle and coin elder were all forced onto them by the little guy, and it made them extremely angry. However, they could not do anything about it.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I won\u2019t provoke them.\u201d The little guy did not care.Everyone was speechless. If you did not provoke them, then they wouldn\u2019t provoke you? They already had the idea of beating you.\u201cIt\u2019s them who want to deal with you.\u201d Young lady Cai Luan warned. She felt that this child was too foolish and might end up in a disaster.What this group of people did not think about was that both of these milk brat\u2019s eyes shone as he clenched his fists and incredibly excitedly asked, \u201cDo they have good stuff on them?\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dExactly who was robbing who? Everyone felt as if their minds were in disarray.The young lady rolled her eyes, and she felt that her worries were wasted. This little money grubber was the same as that group of people since he was using his brain deviously as well.These people who had vicious gazes in their eyes were not reckless, moreover, this \u2018love drinking milk the most\u2019 was a person who broke a record. They did not dare to act indiscriminately, and waited for their clan\u2019s experts to arrive before making a move.The little guy originally did not have any intention of initiating trouble, and so he didn\u2019t take action. At the Starting Ground, he learned quite a bit, and in the end, he once again arrived in front of the stone tablet, and began to examine the past records.\u201cFire Cloud Immortal, travelling through skyfire, achieving fire resistance. Starting Ground extreme boundary.\u201dThe little guy\u2019s expression congealed. This person must be very terrifying, however, after noticing the year this record was set, he was stunned; this was a record that happened tens of thousands of years ago.He quickly continued searching with the intention of finding the recent records.\u201cYao Yue, a word will make flowers bloom and dead trees come back to life. An extremely powerful life force that no one can surpass within the Blood Transformation realm.\u201dHe flipped through many records and, and still found that these still happened several thousand years ago.With great difficulty, the little guy finally turned to the end and a name quickly jumped in front of his eyes, Shi Yi!Like ancient Xiantian saints and Gods, Shi Yi, who similarly possessed natural born dual pupils, entered the Void God Realm as expected. There was a high possibility that he was in the higher levelled Heavenly Passage paradise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were a few rows of words recorded on the stone tablet: Shi Yi, dual pupiled genius, killed nine beast kings in one battle and established a new record for killing kings at the Starting Ground.This was an astonishing accomplishment. A beast king controlled an entire mountain range and had incredibly powerful strength. It was lofty and aloof, and when an ordinary person met\u00a0one, they would typically run for their lives with absolutely no way of defending themselves.Beast Kings were difficult to fight against even among peak level experts; otherwise, why would they dare call themselves kings?Normally, it was very hard to encounter a beast king, yet Shi Yi actually encountered nine. He was attacked by all nine beast kings, furthermore, he killed them all; his accomplishment could definitely be considered extremely glorious.This record was\u00a0particularly\u00a0special, and it held a significant meaning. This was the embodiment of true fighting strength, and it was also the fundamental aspect that people refined themselves to attain.\u201cYi, you are looking at these records. Everyone who has their name recorded here are all incredible people. These are all people who wouldn\u2019t find it difficult to shake an entire region,\u201d hammer uncle scooched over and said.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m recorded on there too.\u201d The little guy puffed up his chest with a proud look all over his face.Hammer uncle had already forgotten this little fact. After hearing that, he instantly seemed as if he ate a dead mouse, becoming completely speechless.\u201cThe record you established is far inferior to everyone else\u2019s. You were using some tricks to destroy the Void God Realm passageway. Others genuinely achieved this by fighting for their lives.\u201d\u201cCoin elder, what are you saying? You don\u2019t want to trade for the precious bone?\u201d The little guy glanced at him.\u201cTrade! I was saying you\u2019re a naturally born supreme being. Come child, let\u2019s trade quickly.\u201d Coin uncle\u2019s grizzled bearded rose up as he was all smiles.\u201cWait until I fully examined it.\u201d The little guy gave him a knock on the back of his head.Coin elder\u2019s smiles suddenly congealed. Wait until you thoroughly examine it? That would take several tens of years! Would I even be alive when that day arrives? Moreover, I\u2019m not called coin uncle you little brat!Bird grandpa was also looking at the stone tablet and said, \u201cYou saw this record right? Shi Yi is truly not simple. It\u2019s rumored that he is a naturally born supreme being.\u201d\u201cKilling nine beast kings in one battle, this record would scare people to death.\u201d Young lady Cai Luan spat out with her tongue.\u201cNaturally born supreme being?\u201d The little guy\u2019s expression was swaying a bit, and it was as if he had heard voices from the past. Certain scenes once again vaguely appeared in front of his eyes.A pretty young lady held back tears within her eyes, and she continuously spoke towards the weak child on a bed. The child was extremely frail, and his two eyes dull and without expression. She was weeping as she said, \u201cYou are the true natural born supreme being, I am sister Mang\u2026\u201d\u201cThe name Shi Yi had shaken this land for quite a long time ago, and there are only a few people who are unaware of his existence. This is a genuine peerless talent, a crowning power since the ancient era. How many people can compare themselves to him?\u201d Hammer uncle nodded his head.\u201cHammer uncle, find me ten beast kings. I\u2019ll immediately beat his record,\u201d the little guy said.\u201cWhat? Foolish child, you\u2019re overestimating yourself again!\u201d Hammer uncle was immediately startled.Bird grandpa shook his head. How could beast kings be easy to find within the Starting Ground? They were\u00a0all lonesome beings. Nine assembling together and attacking Shi Yi was considered a rare instance, and could even be called a miracle. From some perspectives, that also demonstrated the supreme power of a dual pupiled person.\u201cDon\u2019t do something foolish and throw your life away. If you die in this place, you would require a few months time to get better in the real world, and the price is too great. The record established by that kind of person is not something we can break. It\u2019s destined to stay there for several thousand or even several tens of thousands of years,\u201d said coin elder.\u201cThat kind of person? Is he really that heaven opposing?\u201d The little guy always did things as he wished, and his voice did not contain the slightest degree of seriousness.\u201cOf course. I heard that he had already entered the higher level Heavenly Passage paradise and is currently looking for the young of a Pi Xiu, Taowu or other equally powerful supreme beings to battle!\u201d coin elder said with a serious expression.After hearing that, everyone\u2019s face congealed. In those higher level regions, there were all kinds of powerful descendants. There might even be children from pure-blooded vicious beasts.All humans who dared to challenge these creatures were destined to have their names etched in history. Furthermore, they were almost certainly going to enter the Hundred Clan Battlefield to fight for power and gain benefits for their clan.\u201cYou have to understand that he dares to challenge the young of a Pi Xiu or Yazi. How terrifying is his strength? It even makes this senior somewhat frightful!\u201dEveryone who watched was deeply moved. Some people were born deities or saints, and were destined to illuminate the earth; no one could prevent them from rising to the top.\u201cThen I\u2019ll just let him fight those Pi Xiu and Yazi beasts. When he\u2019s done, I\u2019ll just beat him?\u201d The little guy did not seem to mind at all, and randomly blurted this out.Everyone was still in the middle of lamenting, but after hearing these words, they felt like they had been whipped by a shoehorn. Why did this foolish kid break the mood every time he opened his mouth? Some people immediately became angry.\u201cHey, Shi Yi did not make just one record. That last one was too dangerous. Take a look at this one, with the strength of the flesh alone and without activating any Bone Text, he climbed onto a mountain peak in one go.\u201d Hammer uncle pointed to the stone, and as he read onward, he indeed found one more.\u201cSo powerful, with one step, he immediately rushed into the sky and climbed onto a mountain peak. How terrifying is his explosive strength?\u201d Young lady Cai Luan\u2019s face was full of surprise as she felt this was inconceivable.\u201cThis is too horrifying.. This kind of explosive force is too terrifying.\u201d Bird grandpa cried out in surprise.From here, it was clearly visible that Shi Yi\u2019s battle power was unrivaled. The records he broke were extremely astonishing, and overwhelmed anyone who saw it.\u201cHammer uncle, bird grandpa, coin elder, you guys go and search for the mountain and I\u2019ll instantly break that record,\u201d the little guy said.\u201cThis child is truly hopeless.\u201d Those people genuinely felt this kid was boastful and ridiculous.Suddenly, a few people walked over and the man leading the way revealed a mouthful of snow white teeth as he said, \u201cLittle junior brother, let me speak with you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it. They\u2019re trying to make trouble for you. They definitely have ideas about stealing away your precious bone!\u201d the bird grandpa warned in a light voice.Against their expectations, the little guy\u2019s eyes immediately lit up with a thieving look after seeing this group of people. He delightedly agreed and he immediately walked over with a foolish expression.Coin elder, hammer uncle and the others were dumbstruck.\u201cLittle junior brother, I heard you destroyed a Void God Realm passageway and obtained a precious bone. Can you let me take a look at it?\u201d The youthful man leading the group smiled and said.\u201cOkay!\u201d The little guy was all smiles and immediately handed that precious bone over.How is this kid so foolish? Hammer uncle and coin elder\u2019s eyeballs almost popped out. He is almost too easy to deceive!The people beside them immediately went into an uproar. If they had known that it was going to be that easy, why did they even prepare their crooked ideas. There was no need for them to contact their clan\u2019s experts, and could have simply cheated it away from him.This was too easy to obtain, and the group of people endlessly regretted that they had not taken advantage of that opportunity. They should have came over earlier, as this child was too simple-minded.But the man did not pay any attention and did not stop at all. He took large strides forward and left. However, the people by his side turned around and sneered with ridicule in their eyes. Even they did not believe that it was going to be that easy.\u201cI say, I won\u2019t sell it. Did you people not hear?!\u201d The little guy\u2019s voice became louder and his expression immediately became serious.\u201cLittle junior, you can\u2019t talk like that. This thing is already in our hands, and you already agreed to it.\u201d The people across from him laughed with a \u2018what can you do to me\u2019 appearance.\u201cYou wanted to steal it from me?\u201d The little guy seemed extremely angry as he chased after them.These people\u2019s expression immediately became cold, and there wasn\u2019t much to say. They directly took action and did not dare to be careless; after all, the little guy had established a record.Of course, they were not scared either, because this so called record is rather disgraceful. In the past, no one had made an effort towards it; therefore, the little guy\u2019s record was merely an overstatement of his abilities.Chi!Pieces of symbols flew over like blossoming fireworks and enveloped the little guy within. These people began to make some murderous actions and wanted to eliminate him as soon as possible.Hong!However, the little guy was even faster, and shifted horizontally over ten meters with a single step. After that, his hands trembled, and two divine moons appeared. They collided together, fusing into a huge silver millstone that charged forward.The symbols shattered, and the group of people were sent flying on the spot. The little guy charged past, and snatched back his precious bone.Qiang, qiang\u2026Within the sky, a scarlet light shook the air, and its prestige was frightening. Eighteen streaks of scarlet rays of light flew past while emitting wuwu sounds. Strands of multicolored light circulated about, and its aura was extremely astonishing. It contained the aura of a great desolate vicious beast, and it terrified the people\u2019s souls.\u201cPrecious Artifact!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually a powerful treasure!\u201dEveryone cried out in alarm and they watched carefully. Those eighteen scarlet feathers were all over ten meters long, and they flew across like eighteen bloody spears with an astonishing demonic aura.These were without a doubt the precious feathers of a vicious bird, and as they scattered about, they covered the entire sky. They were aiming to fatally wound the little guy, and left him with no routes of escape.The people who were sent flying could only coldly laugh. They knew that powerful experts must have arrived from the various clans, as this was an extremely powerful and precious artifact that only important figures could obtain.The little guy\u2019s eyes were extremely bright. Symbols interweaved within his hands as he charged forth to forcefully struggle with one of the scarlet feathers. A lump of glaring light suddenly exploded, and multicolored scarlet light filled the air as mysterious patterns covered the sky like lightning.This was an extremely terrifying aura. All the spectators were sent flying, and many people released wretched screams.\u201cSuch a powerful precious artifact. It certainly belongs to a very famous and large clan. Otherwise, how could an ordinary person obtain it?!\u201dEveryone revealed a serious expression. Some large clan wanted to take action and steal away that child\u2019s precious bone, making people very nervous and feel like this was worth watching.The symbols between the little guy\u2019s hands became even denser, and began to ignite like flames as he collided against a second scarlet feather. This time, the sounds were even more world-shaking, and the shockwaves were even more intenseThis scarlet feather gushed out with a scarlet radiance, and it was as if a volcano was erupting. Scarlet multicolored magma surged and filled the skies, making it so hot that it made people shiver with fear. These types of precious artifacts were indeed rare, and the possessed terrifying might.If an ordinary person faced it, he or she would instantly turn into ashes. Moreover, the opponent had eighteen of these scarlet feathers attack. How would one fight against that? It was almost certainly an supreme expert making a move.What shook people even more was that child the was actually still blocking and was currently forcefully struggling against the precious artifact. Kengqiang sounds fluctuated in every direction.The people who previously stole away the little guy\u2019s precious bone was then sent flying, and the others who were sent flying previously all laughed at him. Their clan\u2019s experts had appeared, and no matter how powerful this child was, he could not overturn the heavens.Suddenly, their ruthlessness and their indifference coldly froze on their faces. The little guy appeared and carried them away as meat shields to block the precious artifact.Chi.Scarlet color flashed past, and flames overflowed into the heavens. Four or five people were penetrated on the spot, and immediately turned into ashes before losing their lives.The remaining few people were so scared that their souls almost left them; however, the little guy did not carry them as shields to block the scarlet feathers any more and immediately threw them off to the side.Scarlet light flashed again, and eighteen divine feathers re-appeared, flying together like eighteen divine battle spears. Bloody scarlet multicolored light dyed the entire horizon.Dang, dang\u2026Strands of electricity were emitted from the little guy\u2019s body, and they twisted around his arms. His flew towards the few strands of scarlet feathers that were aimed at him, and fiercely collided into them as he charged forward.Ah\u2026Wretched screams sounded from behind him. The people thrown onto the ground by the little guy had all been penetrated by the scarlet feathers and became dust after they died.The spectators were all terrified. This was for the sake of silencing them, a method employed by large clans to preserve their identity, and these clans erased everything.The little guy\u2019s eyes chilled as he loudly shouted, \u201cOpen for me!\u201dDense silver symbols shone between his arms, as he waved his hands, two enormous silver millstones appeared in front of him. It was as if two silver-colored mountain peaks were being grinded together, creating a terrifying sound.Dang!The scarlet feathers collided against it, and intensely trembled. The millstone did not break and continued to rotate, as if it wanted to crush the precious artifact.Everyone took in a breath of cold air. This child\u2019s precious technique was astonishing, since it could unexpectedly exchange blows with such powerful scarlet feathers; it was incredibly horrifying.Qiang, qiang\u2026Sparks splashed in every direction as the silver millstone exchanged blows with the scarlet feather. Each time they intensely collided, shockwaves as terrifying as a violent ocean tsunamis would be released.\u201cI just remembered, I once saw this precious clan artifact in the higher level Heavenly Passage Paradise. It\u2019s Scarlet Cloud prince\u2019s weapon.\u201d Suddenly, someone began to talk.Clearly, the one speaking came down from the higher level Heavenly Passage Paradise and returned to the Starting Ground. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to know.\u201cWhat? That\u2019s impossible. Scarlet Cloud prince is a very famous young expert within the Void God Realm. Did he actually personally come?\u201d Many people alarmingly cried out.It could clearly be seen how terrifying the Scarlet Cloud prince was, since it made so many people restrain themselves out of fear.\u201cThis precious artifact has an enormously powerful origin, and it is very possible that the feathers belonged to an Archaic Descendant. It could be called a clan suppressing treasure that has its own life force, and thus could appear in the Void God Realm.\u201d Someone spoke out.The little guy did not care about this at all. This was the Starting Ground. No matter who came, their powers would be suppressed to the Blood Transformation realm so he had nothing to fear.Hong!The silver millstone greatly expanded in size as if it was going to cover the entire sky and block the scarlet feathers outside. It was difficult for them to descend, completely preventing them from harming him.With a large dong sound, the little guy stamped both his feet on the ground, and then immediately charged out over 100 meters. He appeared in front of a man in the blink of an eye and said, \u201cBy hiding here, did you really think I wouldn\u2019t be able to find you?!\u201dPeng!He slammed forward with his palm, creating a thunderous sound. His extreme boundary flesh strength alone was already world shocking. How powerful would it be if he added the strength of symbols to it? His palm descended, and instantly shattered this youth\u2019s symbols.Pu!This person began to spurt out large mouthfuls of blood as he flew out horizontally. Half the bones within his body made pi pi pa pa sounds as they all broke and deformed from within, making his body look mushy.\u201cSo powerful, he sent the scarlet feather\u2019s owner flying with a single palm!\u201d\u201cEven such a powerful precious artifact could not resist it!\u201d\u201cYi, that\u2019s not the Scarlet Cloud prince. It\u2019s his younger brother, I saw him once before.\u201dIn the instant that Chi Feng dropped onto the ground, the eighteen divine feathers lost their luster and quickly shrunk as they floated towards the ground.The little guy rushed over and collected all of them within his hands. They suddenly transformed into a blood colored fan, which was the true form of the precious artifact. That youth just then was incapable of using it as a whole; therefore, he split it up and used them separately.\u201cStop!\u201d Someone shouted loudly.Not far away, a group of people appeared, and these were all middle-aged individuals. They possessed the aura of a prestigious clan, and with a single look, one could tell they were top level experts.All the spectators were shocked. Why was such a group here? With a single look, one could tell they were important figures that came from a large clan. Could it be that the bone within that child\u2019s hands was that extraordinary?\u201cThat precious bone is certainly extremely valuable. After all, it is used to build the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Precisely because of that, it was able startle such huge clans!\u201dThe people quickly guessed their nature.\u201cRelease your hand and return that precious feather!\u201d that group of people shouted. As the leader opened and closed his eyes, symbols circulated, and it was incredibly terrifying.\u201cYou guys think I\u2019ll let go if you tell me to? Crawl onto your stomach, behave and accept being robbed!\u201d said the little guy fearlessly. At the Starting Ground, even if you were a clan leader or a king, you could still only display the cultivation at the Blood Transformation realm.Weng!He took out a scarlet feather and with a blow of the wind, it immediately stretched to ten zhang in length, directly sweeping past.Peng!The few people who were at the front had extremely high statuses, yet they had to bear the brunt of the force. Two of them were immediately knocked flying, and the others backed up a few steps.With a shua sound, the little guy used the scarlet feather again and swatted two people onto the ground. Soon after, he rapidly rushed over, and stepped on their bodies.Everyone was startled as their eyes straightened up. These were possibly very important figures of an enormous clan, yet they were actually overturned so easily. This would inevitably become explosive news that would shake every region.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As their arms struggled, the group cracked open, and the mountain rocks were split open. It was as if two enormous ancient beasts went mad as they wanted to stand up by using their terrifying divine strength.Two peng peng sounds were produced as the little guy stamped their backs twice. The two were suppressed on the spot as blood dripped out from the corners of their mouths. They laid softly on the ground, and were unable to budge an inch.Every direction was absolutely silent. There was no need to go and confirm their identity, as one could tell from the attitudes they displayed upon arriving here that they were important figures. They were most like the elders of an enormous clan.However, they were now stomped under the soles of the little guy\u2019s two feet. This was truly too astonishing. That foolish looking kid was actually that powerful?!\u201cSo astonishing, people who are able to break records would naturally have an area they excel over others. Even a child cannot be measured through common sense!\u201d The group of people gasped in surprise.Especially hammer uncle, bird grandpa and coin uncle. Their eyeballs almost popped. That naughty child who was was just bickering with them was actually that powerful? They truly made a error in judgement.Those people always felt the way this child did things was unreliable, since he often often did things that made them speechless. They had been worried about him just now, and were afraid that others would steal away his symbol bone. The be alive is to have worries, and now it seemed that it wasn\u2019t like that at all. This youngster so powerful, no wonder he simply revealed a thieving look in his eyes ; wasn\u2019t that just paying respects to similar professions? He clearly was looking waiting and hoping for them to fall into his trap, that really wasn\u2019t kind and honest!\u201cLittle child, please let go of those two.\u201dThe people across from him had ugly faces. How splendid of an enormous clan were they? However, their two clan elders were unexpectedly flipped onto the ground by a little brat and stamped underneath his feet. If news of this got out, what face would they still have left?The only fortunate thing was in the Void God Realm, they hid their identities and appearances. Otherwise, they would inevitably become a big laughingstock within the large clans.\u201cWon\u2019t release.\u201d Little Shi Hao\u2019s words were straightforward and only contained these two words.The people across from him had terrified gazes as they all coldly watched him. He was only a child, yet he dared to challenged the power and might of such an enormous clan? He should be oppressed.\u201cChild, just let go. I\u2019ll tell them to apologize to you.\u201d A middle-aged man said with a steady tone.\u201cNot only do they want to take my precious bone, they also wanted to kill me. You think just a final light speech is enough?\u201d The little guy was very calm.The two people underneath the little guy\u2019s feet were weaker than the three people across from him from a cultivation\u2019s perspective. Those people were all simultaneously struck together, but only these two were flipped over.Even so, these two\u2019s identities and positions were extremely high, and they possessed might that overflowed into the heavens. Their powers were second only to those three middle-aged man. When they were normally angered, great tribes with a population of over ten million would fall, yet they were now under the feet of a little brat.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d The middle-aged man across asked. His eyes blinked and symbols circulated. The sun and moon seemed to emerge and submerge within his eyes as his extremely terrifying aura trembled people\u2019s souls.\u201cI want compensation. Exchange it with your clan\u2019s main precious technique.\u201d The little guy opened his mouth like a lion.Everyone went into an uproar. For any large clan, their most treasured possession would certainly be their clan\u2019s main precious technique. It was the reason for their existence, as well as how they rose to the top.In reality, precious techniques were extremely rare. Even for a clan containing tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people, they would only have one powerful precious technique accompanied by a few other smaller abilities.The little guy demanded their clan\u2019s main precious technique as soon as he opened his mouth, and this naturally made every single person within that group depressed. How could they possibly agree? Every one of them had an extremely gloomy look, and their expressions were incredibly ice-cold.\u201cAi, looks like you two aren\u2019t much. I was under the impression that I caught some big fish.\u201d The little guy sighed. Then he crouched down to look at the two beneath his feet with a begrudging look.This kind of expression, this kind of language made everyone look at each other without knowing whether to laugh or cry. The two big shots beneath his feet almost exploded their lungs in rage while feeling extremely humiliated.Following that, the little guy made some swift and skills movements as he searched and groped about these two people\u2019s bodies to start stealing anything they had.These movements made all the onlookers dumbstruck. How could he be so skilled? Exactly who was the victim\u2019s family, and who was the victim? Why was it that no matter how one looked at it, it was the child who was doing the plundering?\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Those two people began to tremble. How high were their statuses? No one dared to disrespect them on normal occasions, but now they were being exploited and robbed.Pu!One of the two spat out a mouthful of blood and passed out.\u201cYou guys are so poor. How come you guys didn\u2019t even bring your precious artifacts out? Even this coin uncle brought a few,\u201d the little guy muttered.Everyone in the distance felt dizzy. Precious artifacts that could take shape within the Void God Realm were all extraordinary. Who would just randomly bring them out? What would they do if they accidentally lost it?If someone lost their precious artifact in the Void God Realm, it was equivalent to losing the soul essence of their artifact in reality, and its power would rapidly deteriorate until it eventually became nothing.In the distance, the coin uncle\u2019s face darkened. Why was he compared to spirit coins? Could it be that within that child\u2019s eyes, he was equivalent to that that shiny lump?\u201cChild, stop overdoing it!\u201d The leading middle-aged man opened his mouth. His essence appeared above his head, transformed into a flower and filled the sky. It was curled up in terrifying lightning that was accompanied by the rumbling of thunder.The other two also had ice cold gazes, and symbols began to appear around their bodies. Even the entire skies were trembling, as if two supreme being level Archaic Descendants were standing there.As for the clan disciples behind those three, they had been incapable of enduring for a long time and wanted to take action long ago. They wanted to seize this hateful child as soon as possible.\u201cYou think I\u2019m scared of you guys? If you don\u2019t give me a precious technique, don\u2019t even think of leaving with these two,\u201d the little guy said.\u201cSeize him!\u201d The leading middle-aged man opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blue light that looked like flames and electricity. The sound of crackling was everywhere as it suppressed everything. He moving toward the little guy in order to counteract the power of the precious scarlet fan within his hands.However, what made every leap in fear was that child immediately shrunk those eighteen divine feathers into the size of a palm and place it within his bosom. Then, he picked up those two people and waved them like weapons in order to kill everyone.\u201cCareful!\u201d The people were afraid of harming their own people.This despicable child was terrible, and he lifted up those two great figures and began to rotate them like a pinwheel. It gave birth to a powerful wind, and as they flew randomly and unpredictably, the actions were incredibly smooth.\u201cIt\u2019s so infuriating!\u201dAh pu!The other person also spat out a mouthful of blood and passed out. Their eyes could not see, and their hearts no longer felt troubled; they allowed the little guy to toss them from side to side, transforming them into weapons.\u201cDon\u2019t care for too much. If we really hurt them, then let them self-cultivate for a few months in the real world,\u201d said the leader of the three middle-aged men as they all exploded with their terrifying auras.\u201cKill!\u201dA group of people rushed forth with their precious techniques radiating and symbols interweaving, submerging this entire place in an ocean of multicolored light.Pu!The important figure in the little guy\u2019s left hand had his arm snapped by a strand of lightning, and fresh blood poured out. This woke him up, and made him repeatedly bellow out in rage.\u201cClan elder, we\u2019re not doing it on purpose. I beg for forgiveness.\u201d The group of people were terrified, and felt as if their hand and feet were stuck together..The little guy did not care, and continued to murderously sweep forward. The body of those two were extremely tough and durable, and they made clattering noises as they smashed into the group of people. Broken limbs flew about as fresh blood was spilt everywhere.As long as there was battle and one fought like one\u2019s life depended on it, there would inevitably be a bloody event. Very quickly, a pile of people leaned on the round and became the little guy\u2019s spoils of war. He tossed together those motionless limbs into a pile together.As for the two people within his hands, only half of their bodies remained as they screamed wretchedly non-stop. If this went on, they would surely lose their lives. Finally, they were also tossed into the pile of people.It was like a pile of corpses. Although everyone was still alive, their blood flowed out non-stop, converging into a little river. This scene was a little terrifying, and the people couldn\u2019t help but vomit.Fortunately, this was the Void God Realm so if they cultivated enough in the future, they would still be able to heal; otherwise, this kind of murder spree would be too terrifying. If all the experts of this huge clan were crippled, the losses would be astonishing.\u201cDamn this Starting Ground that limits abilities to the Blood Transformation realm.\u201d A large character was extremely angry and his heart was extremely shocked. The child across from him was also at the Blood Transformation realm and fought their group alone. What kind of power was that? If news of this spread out, perhaps no one would believe it.However, many people at the scene saw it personally, so this reality was unquestionable. Everyone was flabbergasted since they had actually made a mistake. This foolish brat was too terrifying, and should not be provoked.Short after, only three large characters remained on the opposite side while being bloodstained and battered with bruises.What kind of people were they? With a shout, they could cause a disturbance within the weather, and tremble all four directions. Today, they could not stop a child at the Starting Ground. If this news of this got out, they would be laughed in ridicule.Everyone was overwhelmed with shock, because this proved that if everyone was at the Blood Transformation realm, no one from the large clans were a suitable opponent for this child. What did this signify? A new star was going to rise to the top, and another heavenly gifted genius had appeared.\u201cLittle child, you\u2019re so excessive and harmed countless people from our clan. Do you still want to keep going?\u201d A middle-aged man was helpless. Could it be that he wanted to seek the help of the clan and have his entire clan come to stop this child?\u201cThere\u2019s over a hundred people lying on the floor here, and only you three remain. Just come and crawl over here!\u201d The little guy exposed a mouthful of sparkling white little teeth as he simply appeared like a little demon within all of these people\u2019s eyes.With a wenglong sound, it didn\u2019t matter if their symbols flowed into the heavens, or how terrifying their auras became, they were still in the Blood Transformation realm. As the little guy weaved and attacked left and right, his power was unrivaled.Peng!He swatted out with his palm, and flowing light flew out and penetrated the back of a middle-aged man. His front and back were both shining \u00a0as his fresh blood surged out, falling right into the pile of people.Afterwards, he fiercely charged forward. With a kick, he smashed the symbols covering another person, and swept across his two feet. With a kacha sound ringing out, the legs were snapped apart. With a muffled heng sound, they landed atop the pile of people.The last person wanted to escape and ran into the distance. The little guy waved the scarlet feather in his hand, and a divine feather rushed out and expanded until it was over ten zhang long. With a pu sound, it immediately turned one of that person\u2019s legs into ashes, causing him to fall headfirst onto the ground.In the blink of an eye, all the people within this huge clan were seized and became captives.\u201cYi, something\u2019s wrong. There\u2019s one missing.\u201d The little guy controlled a scarlet feather, and with chi chi sounds, it overturned a youngster who hid in the distance. He spat of a mouthful of fresh blood and was also captured.\u201cMany thanks to you. What do you go by? I heard that you were the Scarlet Cloud Prince\u2019s younger brother. Only you gave me a precious artifact, the others are too poor,\u201d the little guy said.Ah pu!This young man spat out a mouthful of blood. While being injured and angry, he passed out.Everyone was dumbstruck at the magnificent sight ahead. That was a mountain of flesh that was formed from the bodies of over one hundred experts. All the troops within a huge clan had turned into captives.The little guy walked forward, and his large eyes emitted light. He spoke a sentence that made everyone feel grief and indignation. \u201cA pile of spoils of war are better than two people right? Among you, who will send out the message that these people can be exchanged for your clan\u2019s main precious technique?\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s you. Go to your clan and report that I love precious artifacts and precious techniques. I\u2019ll gladly sit down and chat with them.\u201d The little guy pointed to a young male and told him to deliver the news.Pu ah!A group of people all spat out blood as they became extremely angered.The little guy sat on top of a large limestone and held his lower jaw while he stared at them, making sure that they couldn\u2019t escape. His pair of large eyes emitted a thieving expression as if he was looking at a pile of treasures with the appearance of a little money grubber.In the distance, the spectators were all sweating profusely, and didn\u2019t know what to say since this child was truly outrageous. Just previously, many people thought that he was crazy and didn\u2019t understand what was going now. Now, they all realized and rolled their eyes; this little devil of a swindler just wanted to rob everyone!The little guy examined the scarlet feathered fan within his hands as he fondled it admiringly. He figured that this treasure was extremely rare, and it might actually be the feather of an Archaic Descendant.\u201cSince I obtain the scarlet feather, the rest of your clan\u2019s precious artifacts shouldn\u2019t be half trash right?\u201d the little guy asked.The pile of people agonized as they grunted indifferently with no intention of responding.Hong!Suddenly, the little guy attacked, and the scarlet feather within his hand unfolded. With a casual wave, rays of lightning flashed, and scarlet flames overflowed the heavens; everyone east of him were completely submerged.\u201cSo powerful, this is a valuable treasure. If I could obtain the original scarlet feather in the real world, then that would be even better.\u201d The little guy\u2019s eyes was full of little stars.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cMilk baby, we did not provoke you. Why did you attack us?\u201dFrom the east, that group of people furiously bellowed, and they were all loudly shouting. Thunder and lightning sounds rang out, and the scarlet flames overflowed the heavens as they received the brunt of the terrifying attack.This precious artifact was extremely powerful. It held the might of heaven, and it was difficult to defend against.\u201cHeng, don\u2019t think just because you guy didn\u2019t do anything, I wouldn\u2019t know. You guys were staring at me before, and if it weren\u2019t for these people acting first, you guys would have taken actions too,\u201d the little guy said. He controlled the precious fan, and scarlet light flickered, burning these people until they suffered heavy injuries. However, they were not turned into ashes, so all of their lives were still intact.Several people were particularly strong as wanted to flee, but the little guy constantly waved the precious fan within his hands. Its might truly overflowed the heavens, and together with his precious technique, symbols flickered and divine sounds rumbled as if the heavens were opening.Finally, this group of people were suppressed as well, and another \u2018human mountain\u2019 appeared.Hong!The little guy acted again and waved the precious fan towards another direction. Howls bursted out, and a bloody mist rose and thunder rumbled. Another place was submerged in the scarlet flame.\u201cYou\u2026what are you doing?\u201d some people angrily cried out.\u201cRobbing!\u201d The little guy answered.\u201cImpudence, do you know who you\u2019re provoking? Attacking us without reason, even if you died ten times, it won\u2019t be enough.\u201d This group of people were very angry.\u201cDidn\u2019t you guys have your eyes on me and wanted to steal my precious bone too? Because you endangered my life, I have decided to rob you guys now,\u201d the little guy said.A huge battle exploded. Although this group of people were strong, they were only at the Blood Transformation realm within the Starting Ground, so they truly could not resist the little guy. Even their numbers advantage was useless, since the precious fan in his hand was too powerful.In the end, everyone from every direction lost. They all came from great clans, but now they were turned into four human mountains. This made all the spectators go foolish.\u201cHeavens, huge news, explosive news! A child defeated four large clans!\u201dWhen the people came to their senses, they all cried out in alarm.The little guy\u2019s eyes were very bright as he said, \u201cRedeem the people here for your clan\u2019s precious technique or precious artifact. I am a very reasonable person. As long as the precious technique is good enough or the precious artifact is magnificent enough, I\u2019ll let you guys go.\u201dEveryone was fearful of this situation. This child\u2019s appetite was truly huge. Was he going to rule the Starting Ground and torment these four large clans?\u201cHammer uncle, bird grandpa, coin uncle, you people look for that mountain. I\u2019ll head out soon enough to climb to the peak of that mountain to break that record.\u201d The little guy yelled towards a few people.When these people heard these words, all of the hair on their bodies shivered and stood up. This little brat was truly no ordinary person. He beat up the all the experts of these four huge clans by himself and he was still not done. What was he still going to do?At this moment, a stone tablet emerged, and a row of words appeared on the surface as it flashed with an incredibly splendid and glaring light.\u201cThis\u2026 The heavens are illogical again. He established another record!\u201d\u201cMost Robbed!\u201dEveryone was dumbstruck and then their lids exploded as these words appeared on the tablet. The little guy robbed 563 people in the shortest amount of time, and established a record for most people robbed in the Starting Ground.The group of people felt dizzy. This is okay too? This wasn\u2019t splendid at all!The stone tablet flickered, and reminded the little guy to add some words. He brushed and dotted, writing down eight big words: Heaven Warping Martial God. Just, open, and honorable.Meanwhile, everyone saw the emergence of this new record within the Void God Realm and went into an uproar.\u201cIs there a mistake? Why is it this child again!?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of record is this? Most robbed, Heaven Warping Martial God. Just, open, and honorable? Am I going insane?!\u201d\u201cWhere did this brat come from, where even robbing is honorable? What kind of heaven angering thing did he do in the end?\u201dThe entire world clamored as many people were puzzled. Some cursed, and others searched for information.\u201cA person robbed over 500 person and wanted to extort four large clans? Heaven angering as expected!\u201d\u201cWhere did this brat pop up from? Does he want to oppose the heavens?!\u201dThe entire Void God Realm went into an uproar as a huge controversy stirred. Even those people at the Heavenly Passage paradise wanted to go take a look around the Starting Ground.What kind of devious brat was this? How come he always establishes some disgraceful records?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That large limestone with symbol bones embedded on it flashed with multicolored light from time to time, and golden passageways were created as groups of people came out.\u201cWhere is that brat. Let\u2019s see if he truly possesses the remarkable abilities to establish these records within such short amount of time.\u201cThis child is truly making the heavens angry, but I am looking forward to see how he\u2019ll extort those four huge clans, hehe.\u201dThe golden passageway was bright and resplendent as groups of cultivators walked out. These were all experts who came from the higher level Heavenly Passage Paradise, and after hearing about the situation from the stone tablet of the Void God Realm, they decided to join in on the fun.\u201cMartial brother, I haven\u2019t seen you for a while. Where have you been cultivating recently?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating within the Heavenly Passage. Today, I\u2019m ten times stronger than I was in the past. The friends from Blue Water Path had already died, and only you, me and a few others are left. Let\u2019s meet up in a short while.\u201d\u2026At the Starting Ground on top of that large limestone, the golden passageway appeared from time to time as people both young and old came out. There were also toothless and bald old people who couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the sight of each other.It was clearly visible how much attention the Starting Ground attracted. It was ten times as lively today as it usually was.The outside world was put into turmoil, but the little guy was sitting on a huge rock while holding his chin. His eyes were not even blinking, and he looked incredibly altruistic. He stared at his own spoils of war with a passionate expression as he muttered, \u201cThis pile on the east can be exchanged for a precious artifact. The pile in the south must be exchanged for a precious technique. The pile to the north\u2026\u201dEach \u2018pile\u2019 were made up of over a hundred experts, and some of them were incredible characters and experts whose identities were extremely high. However, they were now piled up like cabbages and had their price evaluated as a \u2018pile\u2019.No one knew whether to laugh or cry. This devilish brat was quite a marvel. How could the experts of the four clans take this? Their lungs must be practically exploding by now.This was reality. There were 563 experts from the four large clans that appeared, and were now stacked up into four piles of people. They all suffered heavy injuries, and were unable to move freely right now.Now, their prices were evaluated as a \u2018pile\u2019 by a child, and this made these people so angry that their noses were almost crooked. Are the heavens still logical? They were actually organized into such a wretched state.Within these four piles of people, there were several highly revered characters who normally would be able to \u2018call the wind and summon the rain\u2019, control many troops, and disdainfully look down towards the world. However, they were now similarly put into a \u2018pile\u2019 and met such a crime. That kind of stifling feeling of being wronged was almost choking them to death.\u201cSo disgraceful!\u201d A old man panted heavily and was angry to the point that his liver was in pain. He stared at that devilish brat sitting on the huge rock while holding his chin while evaluating his \u2018property\u2019.\u201cHu\u2026\u201d A person was panting while seriously clenching his teeth. In the real world, every time he walked out, he would be greeted by many people. However currently, his body was shuddering slightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you two? You have to persevere, because I\u2019m counting on you guys to exchange for precious artifacts and precious techniques. You have to keep going.\u201d The little guy was a little worried that they might die.However, the kind of worry that appeared on his little face truly made these pile of people want to jump up and strangle him to death. It was truly infuriating.\u201cThis child is truly weird!\u201dThose few very old elders who came earlier to join in on the fun could only show this kind of sorrow.Many people were unconvinced that this brat could break two records within a single day, and was so dishonorable and disingenuous. They could not help but take action towards him.Peng!However, the little guy turned towards these people, and symbols filled the skies instantly as light danced about. After several battles, large areas on the ground were covered with more fallen bodies.\u201cThey don\u2019t look like big fish. Forget it, I won\u2019t make another pile. I\u2019ll put you people separately into these four piles to slightly increase the value. If their clans come, you people follow them.\u201d The little guy muttered to himself.These people wanted to cry, yet they couldn\u2019t because they did not actually even have enough value to become another pile. They could only help raise the price slightly. This damned child was too cruel. How could he speak in such a mean fashion?Naturally, there were experts at the scene, but they did not rashly take action. All of their expressions were indifferent as they calmly watched.Hong!Suddenly, it sounded as if the flood after a dam burst rushed out, and four symbol bones appeared. They interweaved densely into mysterious patterns, and transformed into a barrier of blue light as they locked the little guy within.People from the four great clans had arrived, and no one was sure which of the clans these individuals came from. With such might and ferociousness from a single move, they surprisingly revealed four strange bones. They arranged a formation, and sealed the little guy within.\u201cSuch a large spirit. These four precious bones are very extraordinary and mysterious, and all of a sudden several of them activated. A normal family would not be able to inherit this,\u201d a toothless elder said.It seemed like he saw something else and quickly added, \u201cYi, something\u2019s wrong, this isn\u2019t the real spiritual image of a precious artifact, but a fake one. Looks like after losing the scarlet fan, they are scared to lose this clan artifact within the Void God Realm too, so they became more cautious. This treasure can only be used once.\u201dThe little guy\u2019s eyes were deep and his expression was incredibly serious. He did not dare to act carelessly. With a shua sound, the precious scarlet fan within his han circulated with a hazy red light like the circulating atmosphere of primal chaos, emitting a terrifying shockwave.\u201cHand over the precious fan and release the people; otherwise, you\u2019ll be suppressed to death here!\u201dHazy blue splendor was spread out, sealing off the entirety of the surround heaven and earth. The four precious bones were fixed within the empty space, and four experts were in every corner, ready to take action at any moment.\u201cExchange them for precious artifacts. These four bones are very good, but they\u2019re fake images. I want the real ones!\u201d The little guy opened his mouth.\u201cSuch a strong tone. Kill him for me!\u201d a person shouted.These four were all middle-aged men. They were strong and vigorous, and were at the prime of the lives. With an activation from their symbols, the world surged with a thunderlike aura. Blue colored lightning hacked and danced about before transforming into ocean waves as they charged towards the little guy.The rumbling sounds were ear-splitting like the gallop of countless soldiers on their horses.The little guy brandished the precious fan within his hands, and scarlet light surged and roared with a power force like the ocean. The entire world seemed to have transformed into scarlet red.The two sides met and exploded with scarlet and blue divine light.Many people could not stay on their feet despite being so far away. They were also battered by the impact as they spat out mouthfuls of blood, and were swept away.Everyone was overwhelmed with shock as they rapidly retreated. This kind of terrifying attack formed a violent storm, and as the scarlet light collided with the blue radiance, they combined into an ocean of divine strength.This was a collision between precious artifacts, and the attack and defense between these two valuable treasures were even more intense. It was as if two Archaic Descendents had resurrected, and were explosively fighting a world-shocking battle here.This battle was extremely intense, and drew spectating gazes from every direction. Everyone held their breaths and did not dare to speak to much as they all nervously watched.\u201cSave them!\u201dSomeone gave the command since they temporarily trapped the little guy. They dispatched a troop of men and horses to rescue those experts who had been taken prisoner.\u201cBreak for me!\u201d The little guy shouted. The splendor in his palm shone, and a pure white precious bone appeared. This was precisely the bone that was dug from the large limestone within the Void God Realm passageway.He had studied it for a long time, and pretty much knew what this bone was used for. If several of them were combined together, they could turn into the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway. If a single one was activated, it could be used for spatial interference.Sure enough, at this moment, the large arranged symbol formation immediately became unstable, and that hazy blue light started to collapse and explode.The little guy fiercely swept the precious scarlet fan in his right hand, and the vast and endless scarlet light surged out like magma. The ancient formation that had a collapsed corner immediately disintegrated in the face of this terrifying strike.He broke free and gained an edge over those people. He waved the precious fan with all of his might, trapping those four experts with no path to heaven and no gate to earth. With a chi sound, scarlet multicolored light flashed past, and one person\u2019s arm was burnt into ashes.\u201cThis clan lost big! This precious scarlet fan is a priceless treasure, and it\u2019s most certainly a supreme treasure left behind by an Archaic Descendent! No wonder they got anxious and used such a powerful formation to trap him in order to seize it back quickly.\u201d\u201cWu, that sparkling white bone in that child\u2019s hand is also extremely astonishing and is worthy to be called a precious object that built the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway.\u201d Many people paid attention to that bone.The people now knew why the four large clans mustered up such a huge force with the intention of snatching away this bone. Turns out it was an extremely rare and precious treasure that contained endless benefits.\u201cThese are my spoils of war. You guys have to exchange something for it.\u201d The little guy took action again and waved his fan. The people who previously went to rescue their comrades suffered heavy injuries and fell to the ground as a scarlet light flashed past.\u201cKill!\u201dThose four experts grouped up again to activate the sealing formation. The four pieces of precious bones shone again as they oppressively killed towards him.This time, they were purely aiming to kill, and not to trap him within. Even if the little guy wanted to use that symbol bone to disturb space, it would be useless. However, he was not scared. Within this area, no one could exert power above the Blood Transformation Realm, and so he did not need to fear anyone.Hong!Booming sounds echoed through the heaven and earth as the silver-colored millstones revolved. The red-colored precious fan waved about, and he charged forward to forcefully repel the four experts.Ultimately, he received their attack; however, his physical body was completely unaffected. His symbols flickered without extinguishing , but the opposing party was different. As if they were struck by a thunderbolt, and they flew across the air.\u201cHe resisted the attack of our precious artifact? What kind of magical power did he use to protect his body? Too formidable. Otherwise, his physical body would have to be comparable to that of a Suan Ni or Taotie\u2019s young,\u201d everyone cried out in alarm.Both sides suffered an attack from a precious artifact, yet the results were completely different. The little guy was completely unharmed, while two of the four individuals immediately exploded. They turned into a bloody light, and immediately vanished.Furthermore, those two also suffered some injuries. One of them lost the ability to move, and the other carried the four pieces of precious bones while relying on the support of the ancient formation to quickly fly away and escape.With the termination of the battle, the human mountains increased by roughly ten people again. Apart from this, there weren\u2019t many differences, and the little guy was safe and sound.\u201cThis child is so powerful!\u201dEveryone drew in a cold breath. This was a true accomplishment, and wasn\u2019t an overstatement in the slightest.Afterwards, the four great clans frequently sent out people to attack, but they were all defeated. \u00a0At this Starting Ground, no one was an opponent for the little guy within the Blood Transformation realm..Everyone\u2019s expressions had changed. If they felt that the little guy was not that amazing at first and established disgraceful records only by relying on tricks, then now, their notions were thoroughly converted. This was definitely a heavenly warped and gifted child, as from the start of the battles until now, he had revealed an unparalleled elegance within the Blood Transformation Realm.That day, experts challenged the little guy non-stop. Not only did the four great clans arrive, even truly formidable experts who had surpassed the Heavenly Passage realm came to battle with the little guy out of curiously and inconceivability..In the end, they were all defeated without any problems. There were even some famous seniors as well as clan lords. Even though they did not reveal their identities, quite a few people could still see through their presence and might, and determined that they were definitely powerful figures.\u201cToo formidable!\u201dEveryone was fearful and incomparably shocked. They felt like they were personally witnessing the rise of a genius.The little guy messed with the four great clans, and defeated all of their experts. In the end, he even issued an announcement that if no one came to redeem these people, he would kill them all.The four great lords could not bear it anymore. If these people were killed, there would be no one left to guard the upper territory layers of the Heavenly Passage Paradise. When the time came, they would lose those territories and suffer enormous damages.In the end, they did not turn over any precious techniques, nor did they hand over any precious artifacts. The four great clans each respectively brought out a jade jar that contained the true blood of vicious beasts.Although the four jade jars appeared to be rather small, they were quite heavy when carried. There was extremely rare and precious blood of various colors within them that \u00a0\u00a0seemed to be the priceless blood of Archaic descendants.All of them became stupefied. This child\u2019s extortion actually succeeded? The fact that he made four great clans lower their heads made people incredibly envy and admire him!Many people were contemplating whether or not they should imitate this effect. In the end, they all shook their heads because who could be as heaven defying as this child? He faced off against four clan experts by himself, and they were all defeated one after another; these accomplishments were like that of a fairytale!\u201cDid he truly succeed in extortion just like that?\u201d\u201cThis is something that you don\u2019t understand. These large clans all have their own Heavenly Passage Paradise territories within the Void God Realm. Do you know how those four jars of precious blood came about? They were all obtained from their hunts within the paradise. If these several hundred men all died, these \u00a0precious areas would be unprotected for several months, and they would lose ownership!\u201dThe four clan\u2019s men dejectedly left. After coming here after mustering up such large forces, losing in the end made them feel completely miserable .To be suppressed like this by someone, and having to exchange precious blood as ransom really made them choke with resentment.The little guy waved his hands from behind, and somewhat reluctantly said, \u201cWait for me. When I leave the Starting Ground and arrive in the upper level domains of the Heavenly Passage area , I will find you guys to talk about former times.\u201dQuite a few people began to stumble about, and almost collapsed onto the ground.There were also some who turned around. They stared with icy cold gazes, and gritted their teeth while saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you!\u201dThe little guy placed the four jars of precious blood within his bosom, and felt extremely elated. He had already figured out the wonderful effects of the precious blood, and if he used it for its medicinal purposes, he could fortify his spirit power. Upon returning to the real world, he would have a greatly improved spirit, \u00a0and would be nourished one step further.\u201cSha, that baby successfully extorted the four great clans, you\u2019re joking right?\u201d\u201cThose four clans really are like stubble. They all unexpectedly suffered such a defeat at the Starting Ground. No one was able to defeat that child?\u201d\u201cThis child really is quite incredible, making those four clans yield!\u201dThe news began to proliferate, and all for directions greatly trembled. In the higher levels of the Heavenly Passage Paradise, quite a few experts were shocked, since they felt that this was utterly inconceivable.Within the Starting Ground, the people had not completely dispersed yet.\u201cHammer Uncle, Bird Grandpa, Coin Uncle, have you guys found that mountain yet? I need to go and break that record,\u201d the little guy opened his mouth and said.\u201cSha, this baby wants to break a record. What\u2019s going on?\u201d The experts who had not left yet were all astonished, and did not dare show contempt towards this child. After the little guy successfully extorted and defeated the four clans, he was now regarded as an important figure, and his words suddenly gained weight.\u201cFound it, it\u2019s roughly a li out. Shi Yi left a terrifying record there that no one had been able to overcome to this day,\u201d replied Coin Uncle.\u201cWhat? Shi Yi\u2019s record?!\u201d This area immediately \u2018shattered like a pot\u2019.The two characters \u2018Shi Yi\u2019 were like a magic chant that made people\u2019s blood boil. He was a mysterious child that was simply impossible surpass. Wherever he walked, many legends would be left behind.Whether is was within the actual Stone Country or the Void God Realm, Shi Yi\u2019s name was as incredibly splendid as the heavenly sun. If someone mentioned his name, everyone\u2019s hearts would trembled.\u201cEver since he was born, he had never been defeated. His accomplishments were glorious, and it was as if a God descended upon this world!\u201d\u201cWithin this generation, there aren\u2019t many people who are on par with him. He far surpasses anyone his age, and is truly too strong.\u201dMany people sighed regretfully. The name itself represented many extreme boundaries that not many people could surpass. Although he was young, he could still walk down the path of arrogance.\u201cHe possessed dual pupils as soon as he was born. This is the the defining feature of ancient saints and Gods that are destined to rule the world. To be born in the same generation as him is a misfortune of many.\u201cWu, during these few years, some secret news were released about him having an unparalleled Supreme Being Bone!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Everyone was shocked.\u201cIf he is that divinely talented, then he is destined to be unrivaled, and no one can match him at all.\u201d Many elders who were almost toothless sighed with regret.\u201cRight, this child wants to break Shi Yi\u2019s record?\u201d Everyone suddenly recalled and exposed their amazed expression.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. During these two years, who would still overestimate themselves? Many geniuses were reluctant to accept it and went to break his record, but they all returned with nothing but failure and defeat. All of their confidence had taken a severe blow.\u201dEveryone was shocked, and they all revealed a strange expression while looking at the little guy. However, he was very calm without a trace of worry and urgency. He was incredibly indifferent as if he was going to do an extremely ordinary thing.\u201cMany geniuses lost. Whether it\u2019s in reality or the Void God Realm, as long as they strived to beat Shi Yi, it would only end in humiliation and defeat.\u201d\u201cThose are are world-shocking geniuses, but it was rumored that after they found out how much of a disparity there was between them and Shi Yi, they realized that they were not in the same league at all.\u201dAt this moment, a few good characters all reconciled towards the little guy and warned him to not attempt to break any of Shi Yi\u2019s records. It was practically impossible, and he would only disgrace himself.\u201cIs his record very hard to break? I\u2019ve decided to break them one by one,\u201d the little guy said while not caring at all.Everyone was dumbstruck, and they felt like he was a foolish brat.\u201cChild, since you want to try, then go for it. Since you\u2019re young, suffering a few setbacks is not a bad thing. It would motivate you to put in more effort.\u201d \u00a0Some elders enlightened him.\u201cI\u2019m going to break records. I\u2019m going to topple them all over and make new ones,\u201d the little guy quietly said. He was very dissatisfied towards them as he revealed his true nature.\u201cFine, we\u2019ll go look and await a miracle!\u201d Some people heckled.Just like that, the group of people took off and left for that mountainous region.Very quickly, news of this spread out, and stirred a commotion in every land. How \u00a0much self-confidence and power would one need to possess to actually attempt to break Shi Yi\u2019s records?\u201cIs the information reliable? Is it true?\u201d Within the higher levels of the Heavenly Passage Paradise, many people were shaken.\u201cAbsolutely true!\u201d\u201cWho is it exactly that actually dares to be so conceited?. Could it be that a heaven warping and divinely blessed individual will show up?\u201dWithin many of the precious lands, the many famous seniors and powerful clan lords were all shaken, and they all paid close attention to this matter.\u201cYou must have heard of this individual already. He is precisely that child who evoked such a great drama today.\u201d\u201cWho? It\u2019s him again? This person is truly angering the gods !\u201d\u201cRight, that person is \u00a0angering the gods, it\u2019s him again!\u201dEverywhere within the upper layers of the Heavenly Passage Paradise, people were at a loss for words.\u201cLet\u2019s go, this time we must take a look.\u201dMany people were emotionally moved. As soon as someone broke one of Shi Yi\u2019s records, their names were destined to shake the land under the heavens. After people heard this, it was difficult for them to calm down.\u201cWe also need to go and see if he really can break Shi Yi\u2019s record in the end!\u201d\u201cRight, we will go as well!\u201dThat day, the Void God Realm was greatly shaken, and he little guy wanted to break Shi Yi\u2019s record. This caused a sensation far surpassing that of establishing two records and defeating the four large clans.stir up troublesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The golden passageway constantly formed atop the large limestone and flashed in multicolored light. The burden on it still seemed rather heavy, since it was not enough at all for the groups after groups of people that came through.Someone wanted to break of Shi Yi\u2019s records, and that attracted a huge commotion that trembled every area. Many experts who cultivated in the Heavenly Passage Paradise came out to see this.In recent years, there had not been a single day as lively as today. The number of people increased exponentially within the Starting Ground, and over ten to a hundred times the normal amount of people scooched together into this crowd.\u201cWhy is it this heaven angering child again? Can it be that he still wants to defy the heavens? Being able to establish two records within a single day is astonishing enough, and despite them not being very splendid ones, he doesn\u2019t need to be so conceited right? He actually wants to try and break one of Shi Yi\u2019s records?!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see whether or not he can succeed. So many geniuses have been dejected after receiving defeat, such as the princes of ancient countries and some of the most illustrious people. If this naughty brat could actually succeed, then it would certainly be world-shaking.\u201dThe people discussed about until all the things that the little guy had done at the Starting Ground was dug up.\u201cWu, I heard that he was very outrageous. He extorted four great clans, and seized four jars of precious blood.\u201dThe four large clans all ran out of luck. When everyone heard these comments, their hearts were going to bleed. The news were instantly spread throughout, making them simply unable to show their faces, driving them mad.At this moment, not along within the Void God Realm, even Stone Country in reality was shaken up, especially within the capital. All the noble families were discussing this event.\u201cWhose family does this milk-suckling baby actually belong to? He looks quite extraordinary.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s the War King\u2019s descendant? For the sake of pursuing the title of emperor, he started to compete with the dual pupil Shi Yi?Within the vast Stone Country, Shi Yi could said to be in the middle of it all. Although he still had not matured, news of him already spread through the ancient country, and he became the strongest candidate to become the emperor.At this moment, within many king\u2019s mansions and many sacred lands there were countless people paying attention to this matter. The younger generations were even more flared up.\u201cSenior, come out. Let\u2019s hurry to the Void God Realm since there\u2019s something huge happening!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cSomeone is going to challenge Shi Yi\u2019s record.\u201dAt this moment, all the geniuses bar none were shocked as they quickly entered the Void God Realm.Apart from Stone Country, the neighboring ancient countries were shaken up like a meteorite smashing into the ocean and stirred a tsunami that overflowed into the heavens.\u201cSenior sister, come quick. I\u2019ll go to the Void God Realm first and you can find me later.\u201d\u201cI will arrive soon!\u201d\u201cI absolutely must take a look. After all, what kind of person actually dares to break one of Shi Yi\u2019s records!\u201dSeveral large ancient countries all sacrificed towards the heavens each year. Therefore, all of the experts within the huge cities and strategic locations could enter the Void God Realm.Within the Void God Realm, the little guy\u2019s one decision had created a huge wave. Regardless of whether it was this world or the actual world, none of them could stay calm.It was to that within a few capital cities, those who ruled the ancient countries all revealed their slight surprise. They were all disturbed by this child.Void God Realm, Starting Ground.The little guy walked quickly and skillfully, and he his steps were rather stable as if nothing was out of the ordinary. He was a bit confused as to why so many people suddenly followed along. Could it be that his \u2018little big brother\u2019 had already gained that much reputation? Was it already sufficient to shake this world?\u201cLittle brat, can you move any faster?!\u201d some people urged on.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The little guy murmured.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that fact that no one dared to break Shi Yi\u2019s records within these two years, the fact that you created two records in a single day, and even robbed and extorted four huge clans, I would not have come at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I also came because I heard there was a heaven angering child. Kid, don\u2019t disappoint us. I hope you can create a miracle!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one angering the heavens! Isn\u2019t this just an ordinary record? What\u2019s there to be excited about. If I can break it, I\u2019ll break it. If I can\u2019t, what difference does it make?\u201d The little guy was dissatisfied.He was very calm and acted naturally, making the group of people go crazy. Was this child really going to try and break this record? Why wasn\u2019t he the slightest bit excited? He was truly acting too indifferent.\u201cGo, go quickly!\u201d everyone urged.\u201cIf the emperor is not rushing me, then it\u2019s the palace eunuch!\u201d said the little guy in a soft voice.A group of people rolled their eyes. What kind of attitude did this child speak with? However, after thinking about all the unkind and dishonest things he did, they no longer compared him to the norm.\u201cSha, you want to bicker? Haven\u2019t you seen that this little miser even used underhanded methods within the Void God Realm\u2019s passages? Soon after, he became even more dirty, and after sending some information to the four great clans, they walked straight into his trap, and were completely extorted. If you provoke this milk baby, who know what kind of heaven angering things he will do to you. After all, we are still at the Starting Ground, and this baby\u2019s strength is a bit ridiculous. His strength is powerful to a frightening extent.\u201dFinally, they arrived at their destination, and this mountain area was incredibly imposing and grandeur. In front of them was a large lake, and blue waves crashed within this vast area. The lake were as clear as crystal, and a waterfall cascaded down from behind. The vast expanse of whiteness were incredibly powerful, and emitted noise like the sound of thunder.There were many fierce beasts and vicious birds within the mountain that showed their visibly huge figures as they ran about. Beast roars shook the heavens, and huge wings that covered the sky also flapped into the distance as they emitted their long and world trembling bird cries.\u201cIt\u2019s precisely this mountain that Shi Yi fiercely tread upon and rushed into the sky to arrive at the summit,\u201d the Coin Elder said.An elder continued and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s this one. This old man had the pleasure of witnessing the miracle back then. At the moment, there were many clan elders and leaders from large clans present, and there wasn\u2019t one person among them that could attain that height.\u201dAt the Starting Ground, one could only exert the cultivation at the Blood Transformation realm. However, the record that Shi Yi established was purely with his bodily strength, and with a single leap, he directly broke into the sky.This mountain was huge, majestic and grey all over. There were very few vegetation on the surface. There were roughly ten old trees that reached into the heavens, and a few old crawling vines.Water splashed about the mountain peak as the waterfall dropped down from it, creating a watery fog that made this mountain billow with hazy clouds. Under the illumination of the sun, rainbow colors stained it like a colorful sleeping phoenix.\u201cChild, are you ready?\u201d Bird Grandpa asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to prepare for. Don\u2019t I just have to jump?\u201d the little guy said.All the people present exposed an odd expression. This child was talking too much trash. Are you really here to break a record? Why did it feel as if he had already been through this?\u201cNo one should have lied to us right? This child is truly trying to break the record?\u201d Some people began to show their doubt.However, at this moment, flowing light shattered the sky in the distance. An enormous beast skin with a row of people standing on top appeared, and they arrived at an extremely fast speed while sticking close to the ground.\u201cWhat? So powerful, what clan do these people belong to? They actually dare to utilize such a precious artifact within the Void God Realm. Do they not fear of losing it?\u201d some people exclaimed.Ordinary weapons would have a very difficult taking shape within the Void God Realm. Only the precious bones of Archaic Descendants would have no problem with it, but as soon as it was lost, the precious artifact would gradually lose its divine abilities in reality.The beast skin symbols flickers as it arrived close by. Over ten beautiful girls stood atop the beast skin, and they each had outstanding appearances. Their clothes were as white as snow, and they looked like a group of female immortals who were overlooking the earth.\u201cThese are the outstanding disciples of Heaven Mending Pavilion who actually came together. They did not hide their identities.\u201d Many people were surprised.Multicolored light flashed, and a piece of bone flickered in purple light. Dense mists circulated about, and they rushed in from the distance at an extremely fast speed. A group of people of both males and females, young and old stood on top.Such an imposing aura, this is\u2026\u201d\u201cShush. Lower your voices, this must be imperial characters from some ancient country!\u201dThe surrounding people grew more and more numerous, and they all held exalted identities. They were completely packed within the mountain area.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Someone actually wants to break Shi Yi\u2019s record, isn\u2019t it just some vulgar claptrap to please the crowds?!\u201d Within the crowd, there were some young males standing together who looked extremely indifferent as they gazed toward little guy in the middle of scene.They were all geniuses, and some of them had even challenged Shi Yi before, but they only return defeated. It was a failure that was difficult for them to bear. If such a young child who came to challenge this actually won, how could they endure it?!\u201d\u201cCome quickly, that\u2019s the Zhulu Academy\u2019s Female War God. Even she came.\u201dMist permeated the air, and a rainbow-colored Luan flew by while carrying a woman. The bright mist circulated about, and one could vaguely see a woman wearing golden armor. Her entire body shone, highlighting her graceful curves. Her beautiful hair fluttered about, and she had a strict look in her eyes.This astonished everyone since she actually rode over on such a bird. The golden armor shone with a precious splendor that was extremely bright and resplendent. Her entire figure really did resemble a beautiful war God.\u201cWu, it should be this child right? Exactly what kind of background does he have, and why does he need to break the record set by Yi\u2019er?\u201dIn the distance, more than a dozen individuals stood atop a mountain summit. There were elders, middle-aged, and even young individuals who all had a cold expressions on their faces.\u201cWe do not know his origins, and today is the first time he entered the Void God Realm. He is indeed rather formidable.\u201d\u201cInform my Rain Clan\u2019s troops to pay close attention and search for his origin.\u201dAll of the individuals within this group were powerful. They were the direct descendants of the Rain Clan. They had also hurried over here because they wanted to see whether or not this challenger would be able to break Shi Yi\u2019s record.\u201cWei, get out of the way you guys. Are you going to allow me to break the record or not.\u201dRight in the middle of the entire uproar and everyone\u2019s expectations, the little guy was dissatisfied. There were simply too many people here, and even prevented this main character from doing anything.\u201cQuick, step aside and make way!\u201d A group of impatient people urged, and commanded everyone to allow the little guy through.The little guy glanced around. This mountain was indeed rather high. It would considered astonishing if someone leapt on top purely by relying on the strength of their body.He circled around this area, then looked towards the mountain beside him. Although the two had similar heights, the latter was taller by roughly ten zhang.\u201cI choose this one then,\u201d said the little guy.Everyone nodded. These were Gemini Mountains. To break through the record, the one on the side that was a bit taller was the best choice.\u201cAll of you move aside,\u201d the little guy said in a loud voice.\u201cWe\u2019re quite far from you already, you still can\u2019t use your arms and legs?\u201d Someone curled their lips.Although many people came, there weren\u2019t that many who believed that he could truly break it because it was truly difficult to reach. What kind of person was Shi Yi? He was a youngster that seemed like a god and it was difficult to surpass him!\u201cFine then. Do whatever you want,\u201d said the little guy as he stood in place and started to adjust his breathing.\u201cRise!\u201dThe little guy released a little shout and fiercely stamped both feet onto the ground. The entire earth immediately began to rumble as if a huge earthquake had occurred.The ground was originally made up of the most solid rock, yet it began to crack all over now. Then it burst apart, creating an incredibly huge fissures that extended into every direction like lightning, causing dust to surge into the sky.Everyone was astonished. This kind of strength was too shocking. Was this still a human child? Even if someone said that this was the child of a Genuine Hou or a Golden Winged Peng in the shape of a human, there would still be people who would believe them right?With this one stamp, the rocks and earth were split apart, and the cracks criss-crossed and interweaved!The little guy\u2019s entire aura changed, and instantly rose up fiercely like a little child God. He charged into the sky, broke past the clouds, and whistled upwards. The brilliance in his eyes was terrifying, and no one dared to look straight at him.Everyone was dumbfounded. Without using the mysterious strength of the symbols and only by relying on the strength of the body, he rushed into the heavens through the mists and surpassed the summit of the mountain!\u201cIt\u2019s broken! He broke the record!\u201d Someone shouted loudlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His little figure that seemed like a heavenly God, and a divine light exploded from within his pupils. He broke through the clouds and mists, and they streaked across the sky like two streams of lightning.At that precise moment, the little guy possessed an extremely terrifying aura, and as his black hair danced in the wind, the gaze in his eyes were like lightning. He truly resembled an ancient saint!With an explosive force that ordinary people had difficulty even imagining, he soared into the sky. Not only did he surpass the peak that Shi Yi leapt over, he also leapt over another large grey mountain beside it.In the eyes of everyone, this was a miracle. An exceptionally ferocious person had appeared, and abruptly rose to the top that day. By breaking the record that Shi Yi had maintained, he would inevitably set off a heaven overflowing storm.His body was high up in the skies as the surface dust and smoke rose into the air. The entire ground collapsed after the huge fissures extended, sending many people flying. Many people cried out in surprise.With a hong sound, the entire area sank down. It was hard to imagine just how much power the little guy\u2019s feet contained. It was rumored that even the hardest diamonds were turned to dust.It was not even over yet. The fissures extended over hundreds of meters, and made a nearby lake surge up and flowed backwards into the crevices, causing many people fall into the waters.\u201cIs this\u2026 still human strength?\u201dMany people stood here and seemed deeply distressed as the lake water surged violently and arrived.With a stamp of both feet, a force that could only be a display of heavenly might occurred! It was so powerful that it caused the lake to go berserk!\u201cLook quickly, the center of the lake and this area looks the same, and there are many large crevices. That year, Shi Yi must have also jumped up like this, and caused the lake waters to flow backwards.\u201d Some people had sharp eyes, and they immediately discovered the truth.Within the lake, there was a place that collapsed, and was currently being battered by huge waves. Only after that place was exposed did people find out the truth about what happened back then.\u201cSo terrifying!\u201d The people sincerely revered people like Shi Yi and the little guy.No wonder that child just warned them to back off into the distance a moment ago. It was indeed necessary, since with a stamp of both feet, he collapsed mountains with an unblockable force that even shifted the position of a large lake.\u201cSo strong. He\u2019s still only a child, yet he\u2019s already so heaven defying and even broke records! How many people could keep him in check in the future?!\u201d Even a group of elders did did not care about their images anymore and began to noisily shout out.Within the sky, that little figure was like a golden-winged Peng as he spread his wings and spiraled down until he landed on the peak of the taller of the twin mountains. As the mountain winds breezed past, his black hair rose up upwards. His eyes were deep and profound as he gazed into the horizon.Everyone was immediately startled at what this child could possibly be thinking about. Right now, his temperament and age completely contrasted, and that powerful aura actually made some people fearful.\u201cHe surpassed it. He actually broke the record!\u201d\u201cReputed as an insurmountable genius, the youth that resembled a God yet the record that he established was actually been broken. Broken in one go!\u201dThis entire area began to boil, since this result was world shocking.Earlier, many people came solely to join in on the commotion. They never could have imagined that Shi Yi\u2019s record could be broken. Right now, all of their mouths were shaped like an \u2018o\u2019 as they simply stared at this scene in disbelief.This was simply too astonishing. Such a young child was already like this, how much accomplishments could he possibly have in the future?!Everyone felt as if this was hard to comprehend, and many elders who were reaching the end of their lives became elated. A heaven warping, divinely gifted child like this only made them feel happy, making them feel like they had become younger by many years.However, the young geniuses who had the cool expressions of a spectator earlier immediately lost all color from their faces. When they challenged Shi Yi\u2019s record back then, they all returned defeated. Now, when such a small child accomplished what they could not do back then, their hearts had a difficult time accepting what just happened.Symbols flashed, and a Rainbow-colored Luan rushed up into the sky. It was curled up in multicolored splendor, and appeared very dazzling as it rushed into the taller of the two Gemini Mountains.\u201cIt\u2019s Zhulu Academy\u2019s Female War God!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rumored that this girl is extremely powerful and scary. Otherwise, how could she have obtained such a title.\u201dThe Rainbow-Colored Luan split open the clouds and mists to arrive nearby. The Female War God\u2019s entire body was covered in a golden armor, but was unable to cover up her impressive figure. Her bosoms were ample, and her back was as tender as a willow. Her two legs were long and slender, and her entire body dazzled in a golden light. There was an unconventional beauty to her.Although she wore a golden helmet, a large portion of her face was also uncovered. Her facial features seemed as if they belonged to a painting, and her skin was sparkling and white. This was a rare beauty who had a temperament that was different from everyone else\u2019s.She looked at the little guy. She opened her mouth, revealed her pure white teeth that flickered with luster, and said, \u201cI want to invite you into Zhulu Academy.\u201dEveryone was shocked at how direct Zhulu Academy\u2019s Female War God was, since she immediately came up and sent an invitation. However, this was inevitable because they wished to capture outstanding talent; otherwise, how could they become so powerful and extraordinary.A beast skin floated up and rushed high into the sky as it flickered with symbols. A group of white clothed females who were all outstanding beauties stood on top like a group of Goddesses.\u201cLittle junior brother, we wish to invite you to the Heaven Mending Pavilion.\u201dThis made everyone envious as these two sacred lands fought over a child. After drawing him in, they would use first-rate treatment towards him and raise him into a Daoist Protector or a Core Disciple.\u201cI say, friend, you have to make a decision slowly. For your cultivation, it\u2019s not necessary to join these places, as some ancient clans might suit you better.\u201d At this precise moment, an elder with hair like a crane opened his mouth as he sat atop a strange rock that flew high into the sky.\u201cWu, little fellow practitioner, could I say something?\u201d Another person spoke out.\u2026Within only a few moments, over ten groups of people extended their olive branches towards the little guy.These were the absolute most top-notch and powerful figures. Ordinary large clans did not even open their mouths, because they knew they lacked the competitive advantage in the face of Zhulu Academy, Heaven Mending Pavilion and ancient families.The little guy snapped back to reality, scratched his head, and bashfully laughed as if he was feeling claustrophobic.Many people felt that this child was very simple, but there were still some who maintained their complaints. In particular, the four large clans who were extorted cursed within their hearts. Just pretend some more, if you were so sincere and shy, you wouldn\u2019t have had any ideas about breaking the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway! If you were truly so shy, why would you extort us? So infuriating!\u201cThank you all sisters and uncles. I don\u2019t know what choice to make right now. Let me think for a while,\u201d the little guy answered. He did not want to pick one and offend the others.\u201cOkay!\u201dThese people were all very straightforward. They were either born in sacred lands or originated from ancient families, so they did not harass him further because they knew it was useless, and quickly backed away.Afterwards, the little guy\u2019s expression seemed to be deep and adrift again as he looked into the distance. No one knew what he was thinking about while looking so distracted.\u201cI say, what are you thinking about child?\u201d yelled Coin Elder loudly, since he felt the little guy was a bit depressed and was thinking some unhappy thoughts.\u201cAi,\u201d The little guy sighed and said, \u201cI forgot something.\u201d\u201cWhat thing?\u201d Bird Grandpa asked. Everyone else all became flabbergasted.\u201cI forgot to gamble with you guys. Before I broke the record, I should have put some stakes on myself! I forgot!\u201d The little guy regained that distant expression and angrily yelled.\u201cAh, fuck off!\u201d Everyone wanted to throw shoehorns at him. Looking at that dejected and unhappy expression, they thought that something serious had happnened. However, in the end it was just some lousy reason. Unhappy because he didn\u2019t throw others into a ditch?!Just then, everyone thought he had character. Although he was very young, he had looked into the horizon with an extraordinary temperament. Now\u2026 His image completely changed, as this naughty kid was actually thinking about how he failed to throw everyone into debt!With a sou sound, the little guy immediately jumped off from the peak and astonished a group of people into rapidly retreating. They learned from their earlier mistakes, and none of them wanted to be knocked flying again.Hong!Diamond rocks were smashed apart as a large deep hole appeared on the ground. This prodigious child walked out of it completely unscathed as he swatted the dust away from his body.\u201cHai hai\u2026\u201d Many people were all knocked off their feet from the impact of the dust, and immediately began to cough.The fact that the little guy had broken Shi Yi\u2019s record had already spread out at an extremely astonishing speed. At first, it was the emergence of the record on the stone tablet that shocked the Earth and the Void God Realm. Then, discussions began to arise within the schools and noble mansions of Stone Country.This piece of news was like a violent storm, and quickly propagated amongst the cultivators. Everyone knew that an incredibly young child had suddenly emerged, and he was heaven warping and divinely gifted.\u201cWithin a single day, he broke through three records, and especially the last one, he embodied an unrivaled strength. He even exceeded Shi Yi by a good amount, what a Godly record!\u201d\u201cSpare no effort to find him. Clearly find out where he came from, and what kind of identity he has. It would be best if we could invite him into the Imperial City!\u201dAt this moment, even the ancient country was shaken. Each and every major power gave their orders, as this was a child that could contend against Shi Yi, and was definitely worth roping in no matter the cost.\u201cSearch, we must clearly scout out information regarding him. We must not overlook this opportunity!\u201d Meanwhile, there was a direct descendant from the Rain Clan with a great amount of authority who had an ugly expression on his face; he wanted to find out the little guy\u2019s identity.One of Shi Yi\u2019s legends were smashed apart by someone, and although it was only a single aspect, it still aroused a great tempest. Regardless of whether it was within the Void God Realm or the ancient country, this matter was currently discussed by everyone.\u201cWu, this child\u2019s inside information is extremely hard to uncover, its best for us to first carefully observe him within the Void God Realm.\u201dMany people wanted to know what the little guy, who just broke the previously unbreakable\u00a0legend of Shi Yi, was doing. As a result, many people who previously did not come to look also appeared, and the Starting Ground was packed with a multitude of people.\u201cYi, why is he squatting on that large limestone again. What is he thinking about?Dong!The limestone shook, and that expanse of light enveloped him, sheltering that area.\u201cHe\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t be breaking another one of the Void God Realm\u2019s passages right?\u201dRight as they were speaking, the stone tablet once again appeared, and a few words appeared on top of it: Smashed open the Starting Ground passageway\u2026\u201cAh go!\u201d\u201cThis really is a heaven angering person!\u201d\u201cHe really did smash open another one during such a short period of time!\u201dEveryone was stupefied, and they began to make a huge racket.\u201cAre you kidding me? He obtained another piece of precious bone!\u201dEvery region began to clamor with noise. That child is too crazy. For the sake of obtaining the precious bone, he unexpectedly once again established a record, and once again smashed a golden passageway to pieces.\u201cThe heavens cannot even tolerate this, as this angers both humans and ghosts alike!\u201d\u201cToo crazy, this child needs a spanking.\u201dWithin every region of the Heavenly Passage Paradise, everyone was similarly angry. Even something like this was okay? To actually award him with a precious bone, how could they not be angry.\u201cWho will go to the Starting Ground and give him a beating? This really makes me unbearably angry.\u201d\u201cIn that ghost land, there\u2019s not many people who can act fierce towards that child. To go is to look to get robbed.\u201d\u201cFucking\u2026 He broke another record. Look, he actually\u2026 This is the third time he broke open a Starting Ground\u2019s passageway!\u201dEveryone then instantly became mad with anger. This child\u2019s character was too ridiculous; for the sake of precious bones, would he just continue endlessly?\u201cYi, that\u2019s not right, this time he was not rewarded with a precious bone. This is\u2026 God has opened his eyes! Haha, to actually be warned by the Void God Realm, he can now be classified as an unwelcomed guest.\u201cHaha\u2026 this crazy child!\u201dIn every region, everyone laughed to their heart\u2019s content. The natural heavenly laws finally made a fair judgment.The little guy was depressed. Originally, he wanted to gain his third precious bone, and he wanted to prepare for himself a divine formation, yet he never would have thought that he received a strict warning instead. A black cloud appeared above his head, and it did scatter nor was it possible to drive away.He grumbled in a low voice, \u201cWhy do you need to warn me, no one told me that I couldn\u2019t attack the Void God Realm\u2019s passageways. If this was written down in some form of writing, I wouldn\u2019t have made the mistake.\u201dHehe\u2026Haha\u2026Everyone was laughing loudly. They didn\u2019t know why, but whenever they saw this crazy child so deflated and oppressed by that black cloud, the people all felt carefree and especially happy.The little guy was the only one sulky and unhappy, and as he walked all around the Starting Ground, he said, \u201cYou guys find for me ten Beast Kings, I\u2019ll break the Dual Pupils\u2019 other record.\u201dWhen those words were spoken, it immediately aroused another sensation. This crazy child really couldn\u2019t be judged by ordinary means, and wanted to once again do something crazy.\u201dNo long after, there really were a group of people who went to search for Beast Kings, and wanted to see exactly how strong he was.\u201cYi, what is he doing?\u201dSome people noticed that the little guy was standing in front of the limestone, groping it about and making contact with the precious bone in front.\u201cAh, this naughty child is crazy. He shouldn\u2019t have the idea of breaking the record tablet right?\u201dMany people began to develop a bad premonition, and their gazes held strange expressions.Hong!A world-shaking noise rang out, confirming the people\u2019s suspicions.\u201cMy ancestors\u2026 Why can\u2019t you calm down a bit? You even had the idea of hitting the record tablet?\u201d Coin Uncle and the others were all speechless, and they really did not know whether to laugh or cry.The others were all dumbstruck. This child was too crazy, he really dared to do such a thing!Soon after, the canopy of light enshrouding the stone tablet retreated, revealing the little guy\u2019s body, as well as the broken tablet.\u201cAh, it really was smashed to pieces by him!\u201dLight began to drizzle down, and a new stone tablet appeared. Upon it appeared a new record: Breaking the Starting Ground stone tablet, severe warning, expelled from the Void God Realm for two years.At the same time, each region displayed this inscription, and all those who saw it became dumbstruck!Only the little guy was extremely angry, and the black cloud above his head became even thicker, almost burying him.Hahaha\u2026After a short period of time, every part of the Void God Realm began to boil, and it was unknown just how many people laughed heartily that day.\u201cThis is the first time that this had ever happened in history right? To actually be expelled by the Void God Realm!\u201d The people truly were speechless, as even this type of event occurred.\u201cHaha\u2026 too interesting!\u201d Many people began to laugh incessantly.The little guy\u2019s figure was weak and faint, and the black cloud covered his body. It forcefully crammed his body within, making it vague before vanishing.\u201cWhy? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong! There was nothing written on top of the stone tablet that said that I couldn\u2019t attack it!\u201d He shouted in anger.\u201cChild, two years will pass quickly, and we will await your return. During that period of time, you will undoubtedly become a legend within the Void God Realm, hehe!\u201d No one knew if the group of people were taking joy in the calamity, or whether they were sincerely sending him off with their regards.Two years. It could not be considered long, yet could not be considered short either; perhaps a lot will happen between then.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The little guy did all that he could to resist until he finally could not do it anymore. His body became more fuzzy as he angrily shouted.For unknown reasons, no one was sympathetic while looking at this devilish brat being expelled. Many people were laughing until their mouths twitched.Hehe\u2026Haha\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll be back!\u201d The little guy was unwilling, regretful, and extremely angry as he left behind his young and tender voice.\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for your return!\u201d Coin Elder squinted his eyes and responded while raising his grizzled beard.\u201cLeave early and return early. Don\u2019t be so greedy next time.\u201d Hammer uncle laughed and warned him as he carefreely waved a broken hammer.\u201cAi, what a pitiful child to actually be expelled by a Void God Realm. This should be a record too right? It seems like it had never happened before.\u201d Bird grandpa sighed. This child truly made everyone speechless as he was truly a bit outrageous. He dared to do anything for the sake of obtaining a precious bone.\u201cHuhu\u2026\u201d The little guy was angry at the fact that he had actually been expelled. His struggles were useless as he was squeezed out of the Starting Ground by the black cloud over his head.A vast ruin appeared in front of him, and he was surrounded by broken structures. They had a ancient aura about them, and the debris everywhere gave an account of its former glory.Ancient devil mountains appeared one after another as the aura of primal chaos lingered about. They appeared within the ends of the horizon, and were extremely terrifying, as they resembled the times before the creation of the universe.This was the Void God Realm as well; therefore, it was the construct of the essence energy of Gods. Except the place here is already detached from the Starting Ground as well as the Heavenly Passage Paradise, so this place was not in that category.In the distance, a willow tree that pierced the heavens was rooted within the ruins. Its five branches swayed in the wind as it absorbed the mist, and it was condensing the primal chaos\u2019 aura while flickering with multicolored green light.\u201cWillow Deity.\u201d The little guy gently called with a depressed and unhappy look on his face as he walked over step by step.The Willow Deity was awoken from its special cultivation state. It was a bit surprised as it asked, \u201cWhy have you returned? With your heavenly gifts, even if you stayed for over half a month, your true body would not be affected that much.\u201d\u201cI was chased out.\u201d The little guy was extremely angry as he gnashed his shining and sparkling little canine teeth, \u201cI was very unwilling. Is there anyone to murder my way back in?\u201d\u201cWho chased you out? Could it be that you met an opponent that you could not beat and was beaten out?\u201d the Willow Deity asked. Its gentle voice made people feel tranquil and peaceful.\u201cI was chased out by the Void God Realm. It won\u2019t let me stay inside.\u201d The little guy was dejected as he scratched his head and kicked a piece of rubble.\u201cEh?\u201d Willow Deity was amazed. The willow that was always so calm and peaceful, yet it seemed to have exposed some fluctuation in mood as it asked, \u201cWhat happened? Why did the Void God Realm want to chase you out?\u201d\u201cI\u2026cracked a piece of rock. Then I accidently crumbled a tablet and dug out a bone from inside. However, I was warned and a black cloud pressed over my head.\u201d The little guy answered.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. Something special must have occurred. Give some more details. If you truly received some humiliation or injustice, you can return,\u201d Willow Deity said.\u201cO, that tablet is the Record Tablet and that rock is the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway\u2026\u201d The little guy gave a concise account of the events.Willow Deity, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe Willow Deity was speechless for a long time. Its scorched black trunk was absorbing the mist of Primal Chaos. Its five tender and alluring branches were absorbing the essence energy within the Void God Realm, as if they were petrified in place.\u201cWillow Deity, can you say something? Can I reason with them and return again? I was so unwilling to leave!\u201d The little guy let out a hopeful expression as he lightly asked.\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d The willow tree was clear and straightforward as it instantly denied him.\u201cWhy?\u201d The little guy was shy from a lack of confidence.Willow Deity sighed and said, \u201cYou really\u2026 Could you have stepped out of line any more? If it was me, I would definitely not have banished you.\u201d\u201cI knew, Willow Deity is the best. Ah, too bad you\u2019re not that heartless Void God Realm.\u201d\u201cIf it was me, I was have immediately thrown you into the middle of a black-colored beast prison,\u201d the Willow Deity said.The little guy was dumbfounded, and could not help but scratch his head when he heard these words. He justified himself with his little voice, \u201cThat large of a Void God Realm with that many Stone Tablets, it wouldn\u2019t miss one. Furthermore, it didn\u2019t write anything about not allowing people to break it.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just come back after two years.\u201d Willow Deity drew this conclusion as it firmly and bluntly dispelled his ideas.\u201cI will certainly be back!\u201d The little guy ran to the ends of the ruins and yelled towards a large limestone. That limestone was the passageway connected to the Starting Ground.\u201cYi, why do I hear the yelling of that baby? Is it real or fake? He\u2019s already been expelled. Could this be some powerful mystical ability?\u201d A group of people within the Starting ground was bewildered as they looked at each other.Within the ruins, Willow Deity\u2019s entire body shone, and green multicolored light surged like water before ferociously exploding with a shockwave that reached the heavens. Its five tender branches dramatically increased in size until it was over several li long, piercing up into the heavens.Honglong!The space trembled as a gate appeared, and an extremely dense mist emerged with propitious vapors rising around it. It wrapped itself around the little guy, and charged into the heavens and leapt through that door.Within Stone Village, Willow Deity\u2019s original body shone as it sprinkled out endless divine splendor to cover the entire village. Then, a majestic will appeared and descended within the body of the tree.Underneath the tree, a pretty child was sitting cross-legged. His little face was a glossy\u00a0white like jade, and his eyelashes were very long. However now, he suddenly opened his large eyes and quickly stood up.\u201cChild, you\u2019ve woken up. How do you feel?\u201d\u201cYour body was motionless and you had no spirit. We thought that something was wrong with you. Your soul shouldn\u2019t have left your body right?\u201dA group of villagers surrounded him with a worried and nervous expression.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me. Willow Deity was taking care of me, so I was not in any danger. I went to a place called the Void God Realm.\u201d The little guy stood up and informed them that he only went through a mental journey within the great void.\u201cAh, I should have thought that it was the Void God Realm a long time ago. Only, I\u2019ve never went into it.\u201d The chief cried out in surprise.\u201cWow, a mental journey through the great void. How did it feel? What kind of place is the Void God Realm?\u201d Qingfeng was curious. He followed the group of children and surrounded him as they chattered continuously, demanding that he tell them.The little guy spoke everything truthful and did not hide anything. The people who listened all looked distracted and dumbfounded until they finally exploded with laughter after a short while.\u201cI say child, you truly know how to mess around. Banishing you was truly not an injustice.\u201dEveryone burst into laughter, and only the little guy\u2019s little face was dark with endless extreme anger.\u201cWe have to go there and cultivate as well.\u201d A group of children shouted with great expectations.After leaving the Void God Realm, everything was like before. The little guy started cultivating again, and everyday he journeyed deep into the mountains. He crossed the great wastelands and fiercely challenged all kinds of vicious creatures.However, when it was the dead of the night and he was comprehending the True Primordial Records by himself, he had difficulty concentrating as he always thought back to the events that happened a short while ago.The spirit journey this time allowed him to see the outside world. He was looking forward to confronting many experts, and wanted to go back and fight with the endless schools, pure lands, and ancient countries.In the end, he told these thoughts to the village chief. The chief was silent and only nodded after a long while. \u201cChild, you should spread your wings and soar. Stone Village is too small, and does not suit you.\u201dAll the villagers were informed, and they all came over in a hurry. Although they understood the reason for the little guy\u2019s decision, they still had difficulty giving him up.They watched as he learned how to walk, learned how to say yiya, and eventually become so extraordinary. His departure now made all the aunts and grandmas shed tears.Even the group of adult males were silent at the fact that the child had finally grown up. The little Stone Village could not contain Shi Hao any longer, and he needed a vast sky to spread his wings and soar through.\u201cLittle guy, how about we go with you?\u201d Er Meng, Pi Hou, and several others gathered up and wanted to take a look around the outside world.\u201cNo, your cultivations are far from enough to walk out of this great wasteland. Stay here and cultivate well for me!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Er Meng, Pi Hou, you guys are already twelve or thirteen. You should marry and leave behind a bunch of babies before leaving.\u201dTheir parents and the elders were opposed to it, and even mentioned marriage. It made these children flush red with embarrassment.\u201cI\u2019ll go together with little big brother.\u201d Qingfeng said.No one opposed it, because the little guy was precisely going to send him to Heaven Mending Pavilion.\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s go tomorrow. \u00a0We\u2019ll cultivate along the way, and slowly take our time to travel through everything.\u201d The little guy nodded. Finally, he bid farewell to Willow Deity and asked for its opinions.\u201cJust go and be careful along the way. However, it\u2019s best if you return before you are twelve,\u201d suggested the Willow Deity.The little guy exposed a bewildered expression as he asked why.\u201cCome back to Stone Village to receive a baptism,\u201d Willow Deity informed.The children of large clans, as well as the noble children and disciples of pure lands conducted several baptisms. These were held when they were five, ten and fifteen years old, and were done with the True Blood of vicious beasts as well as rare precious medicines to refine the body and wash the innards. It was important, as it concerned their future accomplishments.Before the little guy was five years old, he had been sealed within a cauldron, and his body had been refined by the precious blood of the Archaic Descendant Suan Ni, laying down a strong foundation.\u201cYour roots are very good. Two years early or late for your second baptism is fine, but you can\u2019t miss it no matter what, so you have to return.\u201d Willow Deity warned repeatedly.The little guy carefully nodded to show that he remembered these words, and was deeply grateful. This time, Willow Deity seemed to emphasis the importance of this, and he did not know what kind of baptism it wanted to conduct on him.When the departure finally arrived, all of the villagers sent the two off. The unicorn, Little White, shined all over in silver white light, as if it was cast in metal as it was wrapped in symbols. It almost transformed into a vicious beast, and now, it turned into the leader of these precious mounts.This group of unicorns had already familiarized themselves with the people of Stone Village already, and practically belonged to everyone.\u201cLittle White, I can\u2019t let you accompany me this time. The place I have to go is too far and filled with many dangers.\u201d The little guy patted its lowered head.The cries of birds sounded as Zi Yun, Da Peng and Xiao Qing descended. Each of them were several meters along, and they became increasingly mystical and powerful. Their entire bodies were circulating with symbols.In a year or two, they would fully mature and become rulers of the nearby mountain ranges. At that time, not only would Stone Village be extremely secure, the hunts that the villagers carried out would be much safer as well.\u201cZi Yun, you guys can\u2019t follow either. The journey is too far and it\u2019s truly very dangerous.\u201d The little guy appeased them and told them to stay here in order to protect the village well.The three birds continuously rubbed their heads affectionately against his body to express their intimacy and dissatisfaction, but they had no choice.In the end, only the golden Hairy Ball jumped onto his shoulder. The main thing was that it was only fist-sized, so it was a small target. No matter where he went, it was very convenient to bring along.Before departing, the chief took out a stone box and solemnly opened it before taking out a scarlet feather. \u201cChild, bring this with you.\u201dThis was the object that the little red bird left behind at that time. When the willow tree treated its injuries, it had no way to return the favor, and left behind a divine feather as an object to show its goodwill. This was possibly very intimidating for some of the larger clans.Finally, the little guy and Qingfeng left on their way. The villagers sent them out over several li away. Many people shed tears as they truly feared that these two children would encounter some accidents, as they were still young.The world was too big, and a single piece of the great wasteland would stretch over ten thousand li. Once they separate, it was difficult to see each other again. Many of the village\u2019s females began to cry, and even some of the adult males felt their eyes turn sour.\u201cLittle guy, you must come back early. We are still waiting for you to take us to explore the world!\u201d shouted a group of children. When they met again, perhaps they might have matured and matured and become fathers and mothers already.\u201cGoodbye!\u201d The little guy also shedded tears. After giving them one last glance, he quickly charged into the distance with Qingfeng.Time quickly packed by. In the blink of an eye, several months passed by.The little guy and Qingfeng traveled out of the great mountains. To travel by foot, 300,000 li was simply an astronomical figure. However, these two used many methods. Along this route, they made quite a few ferocious beasts yield, and used them as a means of transportation. Of course, their mortality rates were high, and they had to switch mounts from time to time.Because they were mainly training their body during this time, they were not really in a hurry this time. They continuously explored many forbidden lands and almost encountered death a few times.This was also why the little guy did not bring his unicorn. They were already quite affectionate towards each other, so he did not want it to die during the journey.Aiya!Qingfeng shouted loudly when his body was in midair. He was exceptionally nervous as the surrounding wind whistled past.The little guy caught a vicious bird, and the two leapt onto its back to travel quickly through the mountain range. The vicious bird was going crazy, and almost threw themselves down several times.These two were like a sticky paste medicine. They clung onto its back with their lives as they controlled it towards a certain direction.They only let it go after several days when this vicious bird started to accumulate white foam in its mouth and could not handle it anymore. In fact, they needed to replenish their food and water as well.\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting!\u201d Qingfeng was very excited. This part of the journey was an incredibly refreshing experience for him.Only, it was very dangerous to do this as well. Sometimes, the vicious birds or fierce beasts were excessively unyielding. They would charge directly into a forbidden and provoke countless terrifying creatures.In fact, they encountered danger the following day. They were caught by an unknown beast that had dense purple scales all over its body. It carried them into a swamp, and provoked a large centipede that was over ten meters long. It spat out a toxin, and immediately destroyed a large part of the forest.This purple-scaled beast died on the spot, and became a pile of white bones. If not for their quick wit and jumping off early to escape, both of their bodies would have certainly not existed anymore.They were not pressed for time during this journey. They continuously to travel while cultivating. They actually found over ten pieces of spirit medicine, and even hunted the true blood of many vicious beasts that would greatly benefit their cultivation.After half a year, these two finally walked out of the 300,000 li great wasteland, and arrived at the border area of Stone Country.During this time, the little guy established his fifth Heavenly Passage. A volcano was overflowing with golden-colored liquid as it surged and flowed into the little guy\u2019s body.Currently, he was surrounded by volcanoes above his head, on his sides, as well as in front of his chest and the back He was still only nine years old.\u201cLittle big bro is so powerful! It has only been half a year, yet you broke through again! Grandpa chief has said that it takes at least several years for others to open up another Heavenly Passage!\u201d Qingfeng seemed to be in adoration. Within his little heart, this young little older brother was simply omnipotent.\u201cStill inadequate, I need to become stronger.\u201d The little guy gently spoke.During this past half year, Qingfeng also improved rather quickly. Under the little guy\u2019s help, they hunted down many vicious beasts. Under the usage of the true blood, as well as swallowing many precious medicines, he already entered the blood transformation realm, and he almost reached the mid stage as well.His symbols had long became deep and profound, but his only weakness was that his body wasn\u2019t that powerful. It was impossible for him to be like the little guy who could compete with pure blooded descendants of God Birds or Vicious Beasts.Finally, they entered Stone Country. They didn\u2019t go on the same routeas last time, and entered through a different city.\u201cYi, I felt the Void God Realm. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t enter.\u201d The little guy discovered this fact when they entered Stone Country.\u201cQingfeng, you should enter the Void God Realm to take a look. Find the ones called Hammer Uncle, Bird Grandpa, and Coin Uncle, and ask them where the Heaven Mending Pavilion is and how to get there.\u201dLast time, he was only there for less than a day, and didn\u2019t even have time to ask them about these things.Finally, Qingfeng sat down and began to meditate. He felt the presence of the Void God Realm, and finally entered.Half a day later, little Qingfeng\u2019s mind finally returned to his body, and he slowly opened his eyes.\u201cHow was it?\u201d The little guy waited expectantly. In reality, he was reminiscing about that mysterious world.\u201cLittle bro, I didn\u2019t know that you were so famous. That place is boiling because of you.\u201d Little Qingfeng seemed extremely excited.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dQingfeng said, \u201cYou did that many things! You broke the Void God Realm\u2019s passageway, broke one of that dual pupils kid\u2019s record, and you even destroy the record tablet. Although you haven\u2019t appeared in over half a year, you already become a legendary character. Except\u2026your reputation isn\u2019t that good.\u201d Qingfeng carefully added.The little guy\u2019s face darkened as he stroked his chin. He was still deep in thought, and wanted to murder his way in.\u201cHammer uncle leaked out the information, and many people know that you might go to the Heaven Mending Pavilion or Zhulu Academy. Right now, that world is crazy and explosive, and many people even wanted to follow you to the Heaven Mending Pavilion or Zhulu Academy.\u201d Qingfeng was a bit nervous when he divulged this information.In fact, a huge ruckus was occurring in the Void God Realm. It was all because that legendary naughty child appeared again, and he appeared in reality this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He actually wants to make his appearance! I\u2019m really looking forward to it. I hope I can meet him in the Heaven Mending Pavilion or Zhulu Academy to see how extraordinary he is.\u201d\u201cMeeting is is inferior to reminiscing.\u201d\u201cWhy reminisce, is he your lover or something? If I meet such a strange child in one of the Pure Lands, I would would really spank his buttocks until it divides into eighteen pieces.\u201cThat\u2019s also true. If he was here, that naughty child might be a bit too savage, as his battle strength is a bit irregular to the point of being scary. We are restricted to the blood transformation realm realm, so if we meet, it might easily end up in disaster.In the Starting Ground, that large limestone continuously flashed as one golden passageway appeared after another. There was a constant stream of figures walking out from it.These people all came from the higher level Heavenly Passage Paradise. After hearing news regarding the little guy, they immediately came to seek confirmation, because they valued him extremely.\u201cLook at me opening my big mouth. I really deserve to get beat!\u201d Hammer uncle slapped his own mouth with incessant regret. When he heard information about the little guy earlier that day, he was a bit excited. In his moment of excitement, his voice became really loud, and instantly leaked out the information.Bird grandpa was calm and collected. He was not worried at all and said, \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. With the nature of that strange child, he definitely won\u2019t come out on the short end. He\u2019s full of evil tricks, and I reckon that he\u2019s thinking of something devious right now.\u201dCoin elder was even more outrageous. In a very populated place, he laid down a tablet with the following words engraved on it: Want to learn where the milk child is? Donate one spirit coin.\u201cThis old thing!\u201d When hammer uncle saw, he was so shocked that his jaws dropped to the floor. That grizzly-bearded old man truly knows how to make a business. No wonder he was called coin elder by that strange child.Bird grandpa became agitated as well. He immediately torn off a broken rag to sell false information together with hammer uncle and instantly attracted the attention of a group.\u201cDo you see those two old men and that man with the hammer? They are the same type as that rotten child. They\u2019re all crazy and despicable.\u201dPeople who knew inside information all pointed fingers in blame from not so far away. They thoroughly understood the obscure truth that people of similar natures gathered together, as this was the best explanation.A group of people wearing black armor that flickered with cold and golden luster appeared. They took large strides out of the golden passageway and quickly scattered to ask people for information regarding the little guy.Everyone was shocked, since these people were exceedingly powerful, and their origins were very remarkable. There were some ultra strong powers that were paying attention to this. They didn\u2019t know whether that little child was good or bad.Afterwards, a piece of beast bone that was steaming with purple air appeared and streaked across the sky. There were many people on top, and they were lead by a female wearing purple clothing. She was extremely beautiful with bright eyes and white teeth, and her body was sleek and slender. There were several experts behind her that looked like lofty mountains.\u201cThis\u2026why do they feel like some ancient country\u2019s nobles?\u201d\u201cShhh, lower your voices. Don\u2019t say anything. We can\u2019t provoke them.\u201dMany people revealed their serious expressions, and were afraid of leaning forward. They did not want to come in contact with them, since they feared invoking some sort of disaster.The purple clothed female stepped off of the beast bone. Ripples circulated within her eyes, and she didn\u2019t utter a single word. In front of the booths opened up by the coin elder, bird grandpa and the others, she threw down a coin and waited for them to give their information.\u201cFairy\u2026 She definitely wants to hear real news.\u201d Coin elder was face of of reverence, because he did not dare to cheat these types of people. He immediately told her that he only knew that the naughty child was going to Heaven Mending Pavilion or Zhulu Academy and nothing else.Bird grandpa\u2019s face was full of seriousness as well, and did not exaggerate anything. At his age, he naturally knew these type of people couldn\u2019t be provoked, and not even the tiniest bit of dishonestly would be tolerated.\u201cThese two old things are really not very good people, and that man with the hammer isn\u2019t good stuff either!\u201d Everyone pointed.However, the people were finally convinced. That child who really knew how to mess around really did appear in the real world, and that it was not a fabricated rumor.Today, not only was the Void God Realm stirring with a common, many discussions were evoked even within places like Stone Country. Many great powers were very interested in the child who not only broke one of Shi Yi\u2019s records, but was so intolerable that even the Void God Realm expelled him.Everyone always believed that although this devilish brat was very outrageous, his innate talents were world-shocking. He had a hidden potential that was difficult to measure, and he was worth searching for and drawing into their own camps.In the next ten to twenty years, it was highly possible that this child\u2019s powers could tremble many regions and practically become an unrivaled existence!Even the most powerful kings began to take action, and dispatched groups of war generals to look for him.\u201cWu, the War King made his move. He actually dispatched his eight most famous generals, and he is determined to find this child.\u201d\u201cWood King also became involved. He made his own grandson lead a group of experts to search for him. Looks like they regard that child very highly. Do they want to draw him into their family?\u201dMany great powers were on the move. They sent out troops toward Heaven Mending Pavilion and Zhulu Academy, because they truly did not have a better choice; they calmly prepared to wait for him.Not only Stone Country, even nearby ancient countries were stirred by the commotion; thus, many events had occurred.\u201cHave you guys heard the news? It was rumored that the little princess that the emperor doted on the most left the capital and went to study at a distance place.\u201dThis new was very astonishing. Many people were guessing; this world trembling and smart little princess shouldn\u2019t have gone to the Heaven Mending Pavilion or Zhulu Academy right?\u201cMany people saw with their own eyes that the phoenix chariot she travelled in flew rapidly against the wind in the midst of night. Its direction seemed to be toward the Heaven Mending Pavilion, and this should be trustworthy information.There was a sense of unrest everywhere. There were even rumors that several Archaic Descendants appeared, and asked humans regarding the matters of this naughty child.\u201cThe news that Archaic Descendants were showing an interest in this child shouldn\u2019t be fake. This was because back when Shi Yi challenged a few youth descendants, he came out victorious. Now that someone broke his record, it\u2019s not unusual that they would come out and ask about this.\u201dMany great powers were paying attention. Some people wanted to rope him in, and there were naturally some who were hostile. Rain Clan was considered one of the latter.Huge palaces and precious watchtowers surrounded the Rain Clan\u2019s majestic residence, and quite a few people were indifferently sitting within a palace hall. After a bunch of discussions, they felt that it was necessary to find this child and pay attention to all news about him.Although they valued him greatly, they did not believe that the little guy could threaten Shi Yi. They had extremely high confidence in their nephew.\u201cAlthough be broke one of Shi Yi\u2019s records, he is still far from capable of being him in an actual battle; he would be defeated in an instant. After all, apart from Yi\u2019er\u2019s dual pupils, he has an even scarier trump card.\u201d\u201cFeng\u2019er and his sister has already entered Heaven Mending Pavilion. Tell them to pay more attention. If they find a suspicious target, tell them to do their utmost! Additionally, send two more exceptional juniors there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. According to that child\u2019s age, he shouldn\u2019t have cultivated for many years. It\u2019s impossible for his realm to surpass our children\u2019s.A few people conversed. They seemed very cold, and possessed killing intent. During these past few years, their hearts were always in a state of unrest. The disappearance of Shi Ziling and his wife, as well as that child\u2019s existence, became the number one thorn in their hearts. Once a genius appeared that was similar in age, it would prick at their sensitive nerve.Many years ago, they had sent many experts to kill Shi Ziling, but they were all defeated. Blood dyed the western border, and that family of three escaped.Today, the people of the Martial King\u2019s family also made their move. They paid great attention; after all, that child broke their family\u2019s dual pupil kid\u2019s record, but no one knew what kind of action they were going to take.\u201cMartial King closed himself in isolation, and haven\u2019t appeared in many years. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s dead or alive, but in the past, he was able to compete for the position of emperor, so he must be a terrifying existence.\u201d\u201cThey are a terrifying and astonishing family of people. Although there were many outstanding talents within the capital, the Martial King family\u2019s Shi Yi was enough to surpass them all. It\u2019s terrifying!\u201dWhen heated discussions aroused within the boundless Void God Realm and the borderless ancient boundary, many huge clans made their moves. The little guy and Qingfeng once again continued moving. They received the precise locations of the Heaven Mending Pavilion and Zhulu academy from the Void God Realm, and began to head towards their destination.The journey was truly long. According to their estimations, there was still at least a distance of a hundred thousand li, perhaps it was even a million li, as huge cities and endless mountains separated them.It was absolutely impossible for ordinary people to walk there, since there were unmeasurable dangers en route. Fierce beasts flooded the lands, and vicious birds streaked across the sky, making the journey extremely difficult.Human habitats were like tiny islands within the middle of a vast ocean. All kinds of large tribes were sprinkled within the boundless ancient forests. Large cities were created one after another, dividing up this great wasteland and endless mountains among themselves.There was absolutely no way for people to know that these two travelled alone, without any protection from seniors. They traversed the countless dangerous places within the endless and desolate mountains while fight bloody battles continuously along the way, advancing forward through life and death battles.This was the best type of training. They passed through over ten huge cities along the way, and once again set out toward their destination after a period of respite.Their speed was not slow, and they accumulated a lot of experience. En route, they only captured speedy vicious beasts like the unicorn or spirited birds that weren\u2019t violent, and used them as modes of transportation.In the blink of an eye, another few months passed, and they actually travelled forward another sixty to seventy thousand li. They were like little savages since they were wearing dilapidated clothing while rapidly travelling on the backs of terrifying vicious beasts.Now, their understandings of the great wasteland far surpassed people of the cities. At times, just by smelling something unique, or by watching how the wind blew past the grass, they would know that some terrifying creature was about to appear.Finally, they were near their destination; the rumored ancient sacred land.Heaven Mending Pavilion and Zhulu Academy were in the same direction, and were pretty close each other. Of course, the \u2018close\u2019 was relative to the vast earth, because the two were actually separated by a distance of 90,000 li; 90,000 li was enough to terrify many ordinary people, and was a terrifying number for them.\u201cLittle big bro, join Heaven Mending Pavilion with me. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d Qingfeng was afraid the little guy would leave him when they arrived at their destination.The two little savages scuttled through the desolate forest in their shabby clothing that had clashed with thorns and brambles. Furthermore, there was also Hairy Ball who was black all over.\u201cLet\u2019s make our decision based on the situation,\u201d the little guy said.\u201cYou have to stay, or I\u2019ll leave too!\u201d Qingfeng was unwilling to let go.\u201cYi, there are so many people.\u201d The little guy was amazed.A long way from Heaven Mending Pavilion, they already saw divine mounts like vicious beasts galloping, and spirited birds spreading their wings with humans riding on them.\u201cWa, such a powerful spirited beast. Little big bro, look quickly. That\u2019s the legendary White Jade Horned Elephant. Its entire body is spotlessly white, sparkling and translucent. It is covered in dense symbols, it\u2019s so divine!\u201cAccording to legends, the White Jade Horned Elephant is the holy protector beast of the Little Western Sky. I never would have thought that there would be a descendant of it here.\u201d The little guy nodded.On their journey in and out of the great wasteland, they entered many huge cities. They understood much more about the current situation, and increased their knowledge by quite a bit.Little Western Sky was an extremely terrifying and powerful religion that had been passed on for a long time. It was possible to trace their history back to an extremely ancient period.\u201cAccording to the group of vicious bandits I defeated, they had something to do with the Little Western Sky.\u201d The little guy frowned. He did not want to irritate the religion prematurely because they had an extremely powerful might.\u201cIt seems like it really is the people from the Little Western Sky. With their deep and ancient bases, they don\u2019t need to cultivate at the Heaven Mending Pavilion at all.\u201d Qingfeng was suspicious.\u201cDon\u2019t get involved with them.\u201d The little guy pulled him back and leaned against the side of the road.Suddenly, a terrifying shock wave was transmitted from the air as a brightly winged and beautifully colored fierce bird streaked across the sky while carrying over ten females.This time, Qingfeng could not contain his surprise. Many people on the road were shocked, and could not help but raise their head to look closely.\u201cThat is a Rainbow Peacock with a direct blood relation to the Archaic God King. It\u2019s so powerful and mysterious!\u201dHou\u2026A roar that sounded like thunder rumbling shook and swayed the mountains and rivers. A nine-headed lion that was gold all over appeared closeby. It spat of clouds and mists of golden light that flowed into every direction as if it was discontent with the cry of the Rainbow Peacock.\u201cThis\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t be an Archaic Descendant right?\u201d Everyone was shocked.\u201cThis is precisely an Archaic Descendant that belongs to the noble clan of an ancient country. This\u2026 Are noble prince and princesses coming to Heaven Mending Pavilion? This is truly astonishing.\u201dThere was a palace on the back of the nine headed lion with a faintly discernible figure who had an extraordinary aura. It actually might be one of the noble princes and princesses who were sent here under the protection of many experts.The little guy and Qingfeng look at each other. It was truly astonishing that they met some individuals with extremely high statuses and powers when they were still on their journey.When they walked forward some more, they discovered more and more spirit birds and beasts who were all extremely terrifying. Some were terrified to the point of making people tremble.Compared to those people, the little guy and Qingfeng looked like two pitiful beggars in their shabby clothing without a single beast as transportation.\u201cHow about we go and capture some wild beasts?\u201d Qingfeng lightly said.\u201cForget it, how come there are some many people here?\u201d The little guy was suspicious.\u201cDon\u2019t you know. Recently, Heaven Mending Pavilion has been incredible. That strange child in the Void God Realm was going to come, and it invoked a commotion everywhere. Many people came specifically because of this rumor.\u201dWhen Qingfeng heard, he sneakily laughed on the side.\u201cYou\u2019re the one that\u2019s strange!\u201d The little guy silently cursed and did not say it out loud. With his messy appearance and dirty, he gently asked, \u201cIs it that big of a deal?\u201d\u201cIt is! Many great powers want to find him. Some want to entice him in, and naturally there would be some who want to harm him.The little guy frowned and did not say much as he dragged Qingfeng back onto the road.\u201cLook, a phoenix chariot flew over. What kind of strange bird is it that could be so beautiful? Could it be a Green Phoenix?\u201d Some people cried out in alarm.The sky overflowed with vibrantly colored lights as a carriage streaked past the sky. A Green Phoenix flickered with precious light as it emitted its powerful aura when it flew over everyone\u2019s heads.\u201cThis is Fire Nation\u2019s Phoenix Charity. Wu, another exceptional character is here.\u201d Someone sighed.\u201cLittle big bro, are they all here for you?\u201d Qingfeng gently said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d The little guy furrowed his brows and shook his head.Shortly after, they finally obtained an astonishing news. Heaven Mending Academy was going to publicly open their holy institution, and claimed that only the most stunning talents were allowed in.Furthermore, the little guy obtained another piece of information that Shi Yi might come.\u201cIt\u2019s truly going to get lively around here. That naughty child in the Void God Realm who was the best at messing around is going to come, and that dual pupiled person might have his younger brothers and sisters from his clan sent over. Perhaps they might meet each other.\u201d\u201cI have also heard about this, as these are fresh news. That Shi Yi has a powerful spirit and actually wants to look around the holy institution!\u201dAfter such news spread, it would naturally evoke a lot of controversy. The dual pupil person was going to come and even enroll in the holy institution. This was absolutely an explosive piece of news. It would inevitably trigger a huge ruckus, whether it was the ancient country or the Void God Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The closer they got to the Heaven Mending Pavilion, the more elegant it appeared. The mountains were not that difficult to travel through, and as the multi-colored cloudy vapors impressively floated about, all types of beasts were roaming about.Along the way, they even saw many lakes that were pure and clear. Spirited fish were moving about, and their stripes glistened beautifully as they reflected off the surface of the water.\u201cThis is truly a great place. This is only the area surrounding the Heaven Mending Pavilion, yet it already has such a dense spiritual influence that is quite suitable for cultivation,\u201d someone admired.\u201cWu, it\u2019s no wonder that they were able to pass on their traditions from the ancient era until now. From this pure land alone, one could tell that they were destined to be auspicious and prosperous.\u201dMore and more people appeared along the way, and a wide road extended out from within the mountains. Fierce beasts could no longer be seen, and it was much safer to travel through. Only trained birds and beasts could be seen now.After walking forward for over another hundred li, a stone tablet was fixated on the ground with three words engraved on top: Heaven Mending Pavilion.The calligraphy was bold and vigorous, and a faintly discernible boundless and majestic aura assailed everyone\u2019s vision, as if an enormous tower was looking down upon everyone.Arriving here only signified that they were approaching Heaven Mending Academy. It was not the actual mountain gate, and this place was still considered the outer region.\u201cSo many people!\u201d Qingfeng gasped in surprise. After arriving here, he discovered that tens of thousands of individuals were already waiting here, packing this entire area with people.\u201cWhy are there so many people?\u201d Some others were shocked as well.Someone at the side said,\u201dWhy don\u2019t you guys just think about it for a bit? Who doesn\u2019t want to enter Heaven Mending Academy whenever they recruit? This is a pure land, and even huge clans need to try their hardest to obtain such a reputation.\u201dThe tens of thousands of people had arrived a long time ago, and had been waiting here many days in advance. The mountainous area in front of the stone tablet was congested, and some people even laid down beast skins on neighboring mountains to sit on.\u201cThe world is vast and far-flung, and the great wastelands are laid across it. Many people are absolutely incapable of crossing a distance of over 100,000 li. Otherwise, there\u2019d be more people.\u201d An elderly man sighed and said.What he said was the truth. The people of small clans were simply incapable of travelling several thousand li. Even with all their clan\u2019s forces guarding the children, it would be difficult to reach here.In order to select the greatest geniuses, Heaven Mending Academy would send out some emissaries across the great wastelands every year. They would visit all kinds of large tribes to personally find and select especially gifted children to personally invite them to the Heaven Mending Pavilion.The tens of thousands of people ahead were all people who were escorted here from extremely large tribes, because only a large tribe could travel across millions of li while escorting clansmen.It could be said that the mood in the region was very serious. The place was all made of up large clans that selected their best children together and came here.\u201cThis still isn\u2019t considered much. When they actually start the selection in a few days, there will be more people.\u201d A young man that was fifteen or sixteen years old sighed. This was his third time coming here because he had failed his first two attempts.\u201cLittle big bro, look. There are so many weird people looking for something. They shouldn\u2019t be looking for you right?\u201d Qingfeng quietly said.\u201cEn!\u201d The little guy nodded.The fact that he was coming to Heaven Mending Pavilion had been leaked several months ago in the Void God Realm. Many large powers including noble families all sent out war generals here in order to keep an eye out for him.Not so far away, a group of men dressed in black armor had eyes like lightning as they fearlessly and vigorously walked over. It was obvious with just a glance that they came from a disciplined military force and they were currently searching for something.Unfortunately, there were too many tens of thousands of people. They got a headache from trying to identify people.In another not so far away place, a pure white divine feather sat across the cross. There were over ten females of top with circulating eyes as they also tried to search for someone.There were many troops like this too. The little guy swept his gaze over, and discovered over a hundred groups of these people; this was only the people nearby.People with similar intentions numbered in the thousands, and they all came from large powers who were able to muster up such \u00a0troops.\u201cHairy Ball, stop pretending to be dead. Hurry and get up!\u201d The little guy seized the little yawning monkey on his shoulders.It was plump and was originally gold-colored. However, the little guy\u2019s party were currently rather dirty, and Hairy Ball had been dyed a dirty black by the blood of beasts a long time ago.\u201cTransform yourself into your normal appearance. Don\u2019t let anyone recognize you at all.\u201d The little guy warned. This was not an ordinary place at all. If anyone recognized the golden Zhuyan by chance, a huge ruckus would certainly arise.Hairy Ball resentfully muttered, and his fur instantly transformed ashen white. His pair of large eyes became expressionless and it looked lifeless. Then it once again laid across his shoulders and began to sleep soundly.At the same time, the little guy was slowly transforming too. His face became rounder and rounder until it finally became as cute as an apple. The only difference was that his large eyes became smaller, so his face became fleshier.\u201cYa,\u00a0it\u2019s useful!\u201d Qingfeng was amazed and his mouth revealed his joy. Although his little big bro\u2019s appearance was not as pretty as before, he looked pretty cute no matter how you looked at him. He wanted to pinch him a few times really badly.This was the only little ability that the little guy learned from Hairy Ball. It was a transformation technique that could change his appearance and skeletal structure. It was a pretty wondrous technique.The Zhuyan was considered one of the ancient apes. According to legends, they could transform into seventy-two different appearances, and it was an unrivaled precious technique that could conquer the ancient era.Unfortunately, the symbols within Hairy Ball were smashed, and its imprints had been destroyed. Only this small little transformation was left. The powerful seventy two transformation technique was mostly destroyed, and was impossible to recreate again.Just like that three-headed six-armed technique, both of these unrivaled abilities were unobtainable anymore, and the little guy became very regretful. He studied Hairy Ball for a long time without any major accomplishments.\u201cQingfeng, you can enter the mountain gates directly. Take this talisman and you won\u2019t need to pass the trial, immediately becoming one of Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s most valued disciples.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Qingfeng lowered his face. It was the talisman that his little big bro obtained, yet he gave it to him right now, making him feel ashamed. Along the way, he mentioned that he would personally accept the challenge many times, but his little big brother would not agree.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so polite between us, since we are brothers,\u201d the little guy urged.\u201cLittle big bro, you aren\u2019t going to leave right?\u201d Qingfeng was worried sick.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t leave. After arriving to an ancient pure land like this, I have to learn some stuff no matter what. I can\u2019t just enter into such a precious place and leave empty-handed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll accompany you for a few more days until you pass the trial.\u201d Qingfeng said this because he feared that the little guy was going to leave.\u201cSomeone\u2019s entering using the talisman!\u201d Some people far away cried out, and immediately stirred up a huge ruckus. Many people were endlessly envying from afar, and over ten thousand people\u2019s eyes turned red.\u201cThis is the fifteenth one. During these past few days, there has been over ten people that used the tablet to get in.\u201dThe little guy and Qingfeng was astonished from hearing that as they paid close attention from the side.\u201cThat still isn\u2019t the most glorious thing. Do you guys see those noble residences over there? There are some huge characters living there, and they sent over some of their special children who absolutely do not need to use the talisman to receive the highest degree of education.\u201dSomeone pointed forward, and there were beautiful mountain peaks that had many palaces resting upon them. There were many respectable guests dwelling there, and their auspicious beasts were resting around the mountain.Everyone trembled and shivered. There were people from Little Western Sky, daughters of supreme emperors, and the children of Archaic Descendants. There were even more powerful and mysterious people like Shi Yi.After several days, the day had finally come. The day that Heaven Mending Pavilion began their trial to select this year\u2019s disciples arrived.As expected, the number of people had increased by a lot. Within the surrounding regions of Heaven Mending Academy, eighty to ninety thousand people were now densely packed within.Finally, a group of people quickly arrived from a distant mountain gain, and were perhaps sitting on top of a beast bone. They might even have been sitting on some strange stone, and they were packed with dense symbols. While hovering roughly a zhang above the ground, they were looking towards everyone. The Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s most important individuals had appeared. Without saying any unnecessary words, they lead everyone to the true mountain gate.Along the way, the mountain range seemed as if a Hornless Dragon was lying down, and it had a rather imposing aura. Sometimes, it was possible to see precious old medicine taking root along the cliff or precipices, but no one dared to pluck them.Here, people saw some of the deep collections of the ancient pure land, and exposed their shocked expressions.\u201cYi,\u00a0a rare dog leaf vine that\u2019s rumored to soon be extinct. This one had been growing for at least a few hundred years.\u201d Someone pointed.On a short nearby mountain, a pitch-black, weird-leaved vine wriggled and stretched. Its growth was very good, and its leaves were jet black and oddly shaped like a black dog. It was not very thick or large; it was as thick as a wrist and only several meters long.\u201cDon\u2019t think about any weird ideas. The Heaven Mending Academy keeps track of these old medicines, and they will continue to raise them until they become true spirit medicines. Even if it takes several thousand years, they will still leave it for their descendants,\u201d someone warned.Along the way, people saw many rare precious medicines. If this was any other place, they would have been picked dry already. However at this place, they were all reserved. Being grown within these mountains, no one dared to do anything to them.\u201cThere\u2019s a gathering of spirit medicine there!\u201d Someone cried out in alarm.Along the road was a forest, and within it lied a cold pond. Strands of purple energy were rising from within, and even though they were separated by quite a distance, a bone-chilling sensation could be felt. Right beside that cold pond, there was a plant rooted in place. It had four leaves altogether, and its entire body was purple. Precious splendor drizzled about the plant, and on top of each leaf were star-like patterns, making them exceptionally beautiful.\u201cThis is Star Grass and it already has four leaves! This is indeed a rare and precious genuine spirit plant!\u201dThe people were once again experienced the deepness of the Heaven Mending Pavilion. There were such rare medicines within the surrounding regions, yet they were not afraid of anyone stealing them.\u201cLittle big bro, the spirit medicines that we plucked don\u2019t seem like much when compared to this,\u201d said Qingfeng quietly. His expression was full of astonishment.The little guy nodded. When they trekked through hundreds of thousands of li within the great wasteland, they plucked over ten pieces of precious medicine from all types of dangerous areas. Looking at it now, only three or four of them could be considered genuine spirit medicines, and they had all been eaten by Qingfeng already.In reality, the reason Qingfeng was able to quickly and fiercely break through into the Blood Transformation realm was greatly attributed to those two or three genuine spirit medicines.\u201cLet\u2019s come back later and study a bit. Let\u2019s see whether or not we could let Hairy Ball move around a bit to get rid of some bugs and weeds for the Heaven Mending Pavilion.\u00a0En, we\u2019ll conveniently pluck some medicine as well,\u201d said the little guy.Qingfeng was immediately scared into jumping and immediately closed his mouth. He did not dare to raise this topic again.Finally, they arrived in front of a huge mountain gate. Two naturally formed mountains were side by side, forming a natural door. They were lofty and majestic, and were covered in a hazy and prospicious air.\u201cMany people come here every year, but few can actually go in. Hopefully, a few more people can enter through these gates again.\u201d An elder with an immortal appearance opened his mouth. He sat upon a large limestone at the mountain gate, and looked towards the group of people.\u201cQingfeng, go.\u201d The little guy urged.\u201cEn!\u201d Finally, Qingfeng brought the talisman and walked towards the mountain gate.\u201cAh, another genius. This should be the sixteenth talisman.\u201d Everyone gasped out in surprise with incredible envy.With a large\u00a0honglong,\u00a0a huge bird appeared in the distance. Its wings stretched across the sky and covered the earth as it flew over like a black cloud. The aura it emitted was exceptionally terrifying, making everyone tremble. Many people almost fell to the floor.\u201cThat is an Archaic Descendant. What kind of family would use such a creature to accompany their children?\u201d Everyone gasped in shock.This huge bird was extremely terrifying and enormous. The large shadow it casted over the earth made everyone choke. A few elders and youngsters were faintly visible as they stood atop it.Everyone was amazed. They really were sending off their children here.\u201cThat is the Martial King\u2019s mount! I think\u2026 That God-like child must have arrived!\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cShi Yi!\u201dThere was someone who recognized the origins of this huge bird, and it represented the power and influence of the Martial King. This was as true Archaic Descendant, and during these past few days, it had always perched besides the honorable guests\u2019 mountain; it had formally made its appearance today.\u201cLet it through!\u201d Shouted the elder who sat near the mountain, and allowed the terrifying Archaic Descendant through without letting anyone obstruct it.\u201cIt was actually true! Shi Yi is going to enter the Heaven Mending Pavilion. He only has one goal: standing shoulder to shoulder with ancient saints!\u201d Everyone was astonished, and they finally confirmed it now.The actual confirmation of this news would most certainly stir up some huge commotion.Comparatively, when Qingfeng used his talisman to enter, no one paid much attention at all. He was instantly overshadowed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For such a glorious power to enter through those mountain gates, it\u2019s simply too shocking!\u201d Even some clan elders of larger tribes squinted their eyes as radiance burst out.The wings of the enormous Archaic Descendant hammered the skies, and aroused waves after waves of terrifyingly strong winds. As they swept past, the people below began to feel a piercing pain on their faces. As it rapidly entered into the depths of the Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s gates, numerous young people were left dumbstruckShi Yi was reputed to be a God-like young man who was blessed by extraordinary gifts. He was enveloped in a halo of divinity and was born into the world like a blazing sun that illuminated the endless mountains and rivers as well as leaving behind many legends.\u201cOnly the ancient Heaven Mending Pavilion holy institution could attract him here. There is destined to be a gargantuan wave that will engulf this place!\u201d Everyone knew that this news with spread into all the lands and tremble the ancient countries.Many young people clenched their fists while burning with passion. When they thought about the opportunity to challenge this young man who seemed like a God while cultivating within the pure land, they all became incredibly excited.Ten years from now, when they thought back to this day, they might feel a sense of glory. To be able to challenge a young supreme being as well as attend the same school as him, this would certainly be an illustrious accomplishment.\u201cAs long as you are powerful enough and meet the qualifications, then you all will have the opportunity to enter the holy institution as well.\u201d The elder who sat in front of the gate spoke, and his entire body glowed as he spoke in a thunder-like voice.Many youth were excited as their blood boiled. All of their fighting spirits were high, and their eyes blossomed with astonishing radiance.A group of clan elders secretly sighed. They shook their head while looking at their own clan\u2019s children. What kind of place was this holy institution? Having one out of ten enter every hundred years would already be quite excellent.\u201cWu,\u00a0fellow cultivators, what is going on? Arriving in front of my Heaven Mending Pavilion, do you need something?\u201d In front of that mountain gate, that old man spoke out once again. Whenever he blinked his eyes, symbols would rumble like the oceans, deafening and shaking people until their vision even became blurred.Too many people came today. Aside from this group of youngsters who want to enter through the mountain gate, there were many noble officials and great powers who had sent their spies here; they were all searching for a specific child.\u201cFellow cultivator, forgive me. We are only here to attend a ritual,\u201d someone said.This was how it was in reality. Although everyone knew the truth, no one dared to blunty shout it out. That old man continued to sit on that large rock and did not say anything else. However, it was obvious that as soon as something happened, he would not continue to watch with folded arms.All of the large clans knew about the matters within the Void God Realm, and the Heaven Mending Pavilion naturally knew as well. They understood perfectly well what was going on.Shua!A multicolored light flashed by, and a five-colored luan appeared. A female wearing a set of golden battle clothes was currently sitting upright on top of it, and culls of mist and divine light enshrouded its body. Her facial appearance was picturesque, and her charming face was sparkling. The golden armor could not conceal her impressive womanly figure; with elegant curves and beautiful, she was like a gorgeous war God.\u201cZhulu Academy\u2019s Female War God!\u201d Everyone gasped with surprise.Her gaze was like lightning. It was extremely strict, and it swept over the numerous crowd, inspecting them one by one. Her goal was quite obvious.\u201cZhulu Academy is truly straightforward. They came to the Heaven Mending Academy to steal people!\u201d Many people were amazed. They didn\u2019t even need to think in order to know what was going on.\u201cLittle child, you are stepping over your boundaries.\u201d The elder in front of the mountain gate spoke.\u201cSenior is thinking too much,\u201d spoke the female War God. Her body was covered in golden armor and her breasts were plump. Her waist was as soft as a willow, and her legs were as straight as pencils. Her sparkling face was incredibly calm, and there was a unique beauty to her.At this precise moment, groups of troops began to take action as well. With this Female War God leading the way, the other large powers no longer hesitated. They rapidly inspected the masses in order to find their target.Since this was outside the mountain, they had not yet truly entered inside. Once the selection finished and that odd child entered inside, they would never have another chance.\u201cTrial begin!\u201d The elder in front of the mountain gate did not say anymore. His best method was to immediately let the young people into the trials, because the outsiders had no way of setting their feet inside.A group of people appeared, and it was precisely this group of experts who were going to lead everyone in. They were either standing in midair on symbol bones or sitting on flying rocks as they divided the eighty to ninety thousand people into eight groups.\u201cLet\u2019s go and head for the ancient battlefield.\u201dThey did not enter through the mountain gate but instead lead everyone westward. This entire path was filled with dense forests on both sides, and the surrounding scenery became increasingly desolate. The propitious air and colored fog disappeared as miasma appeared within this ancient and wretched forest.West of the Heaven Mending Pavilion was once an ancient and boundless battlefield that took up a vast amount of land. Now, however, it was simply a great wasteland.This endless mountainous region was taken control of by the Heaven Mending Pavilion a long time ago. They were quite clear what types of malicious beasts resided here, and it became a type of trial ground.\u201cThis battlefield is altogether divided into eight regions. We already laid down the symbol formations to ensure no evil beasts could enter within.\u201dThe people from the Heaven Mending Pavilion explained the rules. They did not need anyone to battle any beasts, because it would inevitably end in their death, and that type of selection method would be too bloody. As long as these children managed to make their way into the symbol region, it would be enough.\u201cResisting against the ancient symbol formation is incredibly challenging. I\u2019ve already failed three times.\u201d An 18 to 19 old youth agonizingly said.He was considered outstanding within his clan and was sent here every single time. However, as soon as he got here, he could not pass through and failed.\u201cIf anyone is strong enough to break into the symbol regions, he or she could enter the second round. There\u2019s a nice surprise there, but there are quite a few vicious beasts as well. As a result, it is incredibly dangerous, so make your decisions carefully.The people of Heaven Mending Pavilion spoke, but they did not explain any further. However, this was enough to make everyone understand that the symbol region was for the selection of ordinary disciples, and the second stage of the battlefield was a trial by fire for geniuses.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Enter the battlefield!\u201dAn order came down, and the eight groups people endlessly swarmed into their respective regions. There was absolutely no reason to fear whether the space was big enough or not, since this place was truly huge.The war generals of many great powers became anxious. How would they find a single child within a group of this many people? It was truly too late to start searching now. Finally, they charged into all the entrances and unwillingly exercised their final search.Unfortunately, their actions were destined to be fruitless.The little guy\u2019s face resembled a large apple right now. His face was chubby, and made it irresistible for people to want to pinch his cheeks. This appearance was completely different from when he was in the Void God Realm.\u201cLittle fatty, what are you looking at? Don\u2019t dawdle and stop walking for no reason!\u201d A little girl smiled and came to pinch him.The little guy was depressed. Wasn\u2019t he just looking at the pretty female disciples of Heaven Mending Pavilion for a bit? He did not even look for a long time. How was that enough to warrant a pinch?\u201cLittle fatty, shouldn\u2019t you try and lose weight? Being so chubby is not good for cultivation.\u201d As soon as he was going to entering the nearby ancient battlefield, another female disciple pinched his apple like face with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m not fat!\u201d He lightly muttered and instantly disappeared after he stepped into the flashing symbol gate.Everything was stirring within the Void God Realm. News of what happened at Heaven Mending Pavilion quickly spread, and many people at the Heavenly Passage Paradise already knew what happened.\u201cShi Yi went as expected, so Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s prestige will greatly increase. Could another saint come out of there in the future?\u201d\u201cMartial King\u2019s family truly knows how to muster up a large force. They used an Archaic Descendant to send him over. They take care of him extremely well, and use all that they could in order to raise him.\u201d\u201cWu, it is unknown whether the Martial King family\u2019s thirteenth elder is alive or not. The genius, Shi Ziling, had also disappeared for many years. Obviously, they were going to use all their power to raise that dual pupil person. As soon as he matures, he would inevitably become a great power.Void God Realm was clamoring as the news was spread out at an astonishing rate. All of the great ancient countries trembled when they quickly obtained news of what happened at the Heaven Mending Pavilion.The name Shi Yi created a large disturbance. It seemed as if everyone was currently discussing it.Soon after, people began to bring up the little guy as well, as even now, no one had found a trace of him. No one had seen him yet.\u201cDid that naughty kid really go to the Heaven Mending Pavilion? Why haven\u2019t they found him yet?\u201d\u201cSomething\u2019s off here. With that child\u2019s strange nature, I feel like he most likely shook all of us off and purposely tormented the large families.\u201cThat\u2019s actually highly likely!\u201dThey\u2019ve waited for such a long time, and yet there still hadn\u2019t been any news about that naughty kid, making everyone\u2019s faces darken.They began to felt that it was increasingly likely that they\u2019d been swindled by that devilish brat.\u201cSomething\u2019s still off. Didn\u2019t that coin elder make a poisonous oath? Does he dare to deceive a noble princess?\u201d\u201cThat also makes sense. Then why didn\u2019t he show up? Whether it\u2019s the Heaven Mending Pavilion or Zhulu Academy, there hasn\u2019t been a single trace of him at either location.Everyone wished that the little guy would show up at Heaven Mending Pavilion. After all, he broke one of Shi Yi\u2019s \u00a0records, the two of them meeting up in the real world was something that people longed for even more.Heaven Mending Pavilion, within the eighth region of the ancient battlefield, the little guy stepped into a forest and stared forward. Floating symbols began to shine before targeting him.There weren\u2019t any wild beasts or vicious birds here, and there were only endless symbols. For many people, this was like breaking through the heavens, and it was extremely hard.Clearly, the little guy was not like these people. He stamped on the ground, cracking the ground beneath him. As a result, huge rocks soared through the air, and immediately smashed into the symbols, extinguishing them.He did not think too much over it, nor did he waste much time or effort. He easily and directly broke through the symbols while charging forward; everything in front of him was violently destroyed.This was due to the fact that although these symbols were complex, they did not hold any significance before him. He had already researched them a long time ago, and had long exceeded this realm. He did not want to break them one by one and make unnecessary delays, and that was why he was currently charging like a madman.\u201cThis place is pretty big, no wonder they gave us three days,\u201d he muttered to himself while breaking through everything like hot knife through butter. Soon after, he entered into the depths of the eighth region.After he arrived there, he found the difficulty of the symbols beginning to grow stronger. Some formations became a little more interesting, so he began to stop from time to time, and increased the time he began to pause for.\u201cBreaking through formations is too dull. It\u2019s really boring,\u201d the little guy muttered.People who are skilled really do not know the suffering of others. Just how exhausted were those people behind him? From seven to eight year-olds to those in their twenties, they were all completely drained. Their sweat rained down like rain, and they were all about to collapse.\u201cIs there a mistake? Does Heaven Mending Pavilion not want to recruit anyone today? How come the setup of the symbols is so complex? How many people will pass?\u201cAi, it\u2019s all trouble caused by geniuses. First it\u2019s Shi Yi, then it\u2019s the emperor\u2019s daughter, and even an odd child was going to come. With the arrival of these geniuses, they acted correspondingly; therefore, Heaven Mending Pavilion naturally set up their gates a little harder.This group of people complained. They were all incomparably angry.The little guy was strolling across the depths of the eighth region. After pondering for a bit, his eyes suddenly shined as he excitedly clenched his fists and began to laugh.\u201cSince there are symbols here, there must be precious bones underneath the ground!\u201dHis eyes emitted a thieving light as his figure turned into a shadow. He rapidly bore through the ground, and searched everywhere in hopes of finding the primitive precious bones.\u201cI found it! There definitely has to be one here!\u201d He stopped while facing a short mountain that was only ten meters tall. He carefully studied for a bit, then with a whistle, he rapidly charged forward with all of the strength of the \u00a0symbols within his body in order to take violent and tyrannical actions.Hong, Hong\u2026Finally, smoke and dust rose into the air as this short mountain was smashed by the little guy. A sparkling precious bone fell out from within.He quickly ran over as he picked it up with a smile on his face. Afterwards like a thief, he gazed into every direction and quickly put it into his bosoms before disappearing again like smoke.\u201cIn such a large ancient battlefield, there has to be more than one piece,\u201d the little guy muttered. He completely treated this place like his vegetable garden as he prepared to pull out all the \u2018radishes.\u2019Hong!He found the second target and he was even more direct this time. He smashed this rocky dam apart with a kick, and the radiance of the symbols flourished greatly as a precious bone appeared.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not the rarest bone, it\u2019s still not bad.\u201d The little guy was all smiles. His apple-like face overflowed with smiles and exposed his pretty little canine teeth.He advanced just like this like, constantly breaking the formations in order to excavate the precious bones within. He quickly obtained ten of them, and wrapped them all completely in beast skin before carrying them on his back.\u201cYi,\u00a0why is it becoming easier. Could it be my strength restored?\u201dAt this precise moment, then tens of thousands of youngsters within the eighth region were all amazed as they felt the difficulty decreasing. All of them were incredibly excited as they dauntlessly charged forward with great efforts.\u201cWhy do I feel like I will succeed in passing this time!\u201dAt this moment in the eighth region, not only one person, but all the people began to have self-confidence again. They were all incredibly excited as they all started to charge forward with all their strength.Time slowly elapsed and the people outside were all anxious as they waited, especially all the clan elders of large clans. They came in order to protect their own clan\u2019s disciples and they don\u2019t know how many people would be left over in the end.\u201cWu,\u00a0the hurdle is too difficult this year. I reckon that many clans will be dispirited and disappointed since not many children can remain.\u201d An elder of Heaven Mending Pavilion lightly spoke.Beside him were several people who clearly held rather high statuses. All of them nodded, and one person said, \u201cAfter all, many geniuses wanted to come, and they took up quite a few places. We can only do this.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know which region is the strongest, and will have the most people come out.\u201d\u201cQuite a bit of time has passed already. If they are outstanding enough, then there should be children who have charged out already. We should go to the exits and wait there in order to lead anyone that comes out through Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s mountain gate.An elder furrowed his brows with some worry and said, \u201cI truly fear that some region will have no one come out. After all, that last trial is a bit hard, since it was prepared for the geniuses.Even so, they left for the exit in order to greet the children who successfully passed the trial.When all the elders of large clans and tribes saw this, they immediately followed with a bit of nervousness within their hearts. They all wished that their clans would have more children who could remain.At the same time, discussion and comments were everywhere within the Void God Realm. Everyone was awaiting the appearance of the naughty child. In the end, they were disappointed that there wasn\u2019t any commotion.\u201cThat baby shouldn\u2019t have tricked us too right?\u201d At the Starting ground, hammer uncle furrowed his brows.\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Bird grandpa was as calm as ever.Coin elder said, \u201cI have a feeling that this devilish brat will most likely create an even bigger commotion this time. Just wait and see.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Inside of it were eighteen sparkling and translucent symbol bones, and they were flashing with multicolored light as dense symbols covered the interior.Although they weren\u2019t the precious bones of descendants, such a large bag was still invaluable.There were some genuine bones that used to belong to Archaic Descendants, and they were used to suppress and protect the land. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t dig any of those out. Had he\u00a0truly dug deeper, he might have suffered some severe injuries and created an extremely large scene.The little guy was behaving like a thief as he observed the surrounding scene. He did not see anyone come to arrest him, and began to calm down.\u201cSince I already got these, I need to leave quickly!\u201d He slipped away like smoke, and disappeared as soon as he uttered those words.He was preparing to enter the second stage of the battlefield since he truly could not stay here any longer. Otherwise, he feared that someone would deal with him out of of extreme anger.Everyone was extremely happy inside the eighth region. The more they charged inside, the more confident they were. They felt as if they had unlimited strength inside of them as they broke through the formations extremely easily.Over ten thousand people were rapidly advancing. They were scattered within different forests as they charged to the finish line from every direction with complete confidence in victory.\u201cBy heaven and earth, I\u2019ve failed four times already! Today, I\u2019ll certainly succeed, and my bitter cultivation will not be in vain!\u201d A young man roughly twenty years old had tears flowing from his eyes.\u201cThis isn\u2019t that hard, and it\u2019s my first time taking the trial. Why does it feel like I can pretty much pass this? Looks like I\u2019m truly a genius.\u201d A nasally kid1\u00a0said with extreme happiness.A patch of symbols flashed at the exit, but the little guy ignored it without thinking too much. He charged towards another side, and ahead of him, multicolored light dazzled and glittered before transforming into a barrier to block him.Hong!The little guy extended his ten fingers to display his might. They lightly erupted as he utilized the Suan Ni\u2019s precious technique to directly smash apart the barrier. Then, he quickly jumped over.This was a battlefield that was even more ancient than the one before it, with ancient trees reaching the sky as apes cried and tigers whistled. As soon as he entered, he felt a bleak and ancient atmosphere assaulting his face.With a\u00a0wenglong\u00a0sound,\u00a0a mountain peak in the distance collapsed as a huge black tiger roared into the sky. With a single press of its claws, it immediately collapsed that mountain peak. It was so terrifying that it made people tremble.\u201cSo scary. That figure is so big!\u201d Even the little guy was a bit shocked. Although that pitch-black tiger wasn\u2019t an Archaic Descendant, it absolutely was not a creature that should be provoked, and was a terrifying beast king.\u201cThis is worthy of being the second stage of the battlefield. It is indeed a battle of life and death here, and it\u2019s completely up to one\u2019s own choice!\u201d People from another direction entered the second level of the battlefield as well.Anyone capable of entering this place was naturally a genius. They all immediately concealed and hid themselves; otherwise, they might be suddenly hunted down by a vicious beasts that scuttled out.The second level of the battlefield was interconnected. People from all eight regions ended up meeting here, since there was no distinction in this stage.The little guy was not nervous at all after entering. After all, he had already crashed through almost a million li of the great wasteland while sometimes protecting Qingfeng as well. He could not be any more familiar with ancient forests like these.After observing for a while, he quickly traversed through the thick forest like a nimble ancient divine leopard, and startled a group of wild beasts. However, he did not provoke any of those terrifying creatures.Finally, he understood the circumstances surrounding him, and he once again carefully thought for a while. Following that, like a thief, he began to sort out his stolen goods.He was very cautious and prudent. He separated the eighteen precious bones into six piles of threes and buried them into different places. Some were buried in swamps, some in streams and some were even placed in abandoned bird nests.After he thought for a bit, this so called second battlefield was a lot like the great wasteland since no one protected him. He thought that there should be a way for him to detour around here in the future to retrieve his hidden stuff.Everything had been taken care of, and his heart was at peace again. He straightened his back and raised his head with a just and honorable look on his face. With a magnanimous appearance, he started to stroll through the forest.According to the requirements, he had to find a tablet within the second battlefield, and upon it would be recorded the missions they had to carry out.Obviously, they did not point out the exact direction to the tablet. They wanted these youth to get out of their comfort zones by challenging these fierce beasts and vicious birds, testing these geniuses.The little guy was fully content with\u00a0his own achievements, and he became calm and tranquil. However, he did not know that the people outside were about to suffer through torment.The elders of Heaven Mending Pavilion brought a squadron towards each of the eight regions. They arrived quickly in order to wait for all the successful children that passed the trial.\u201cThe first region is truly a bit pitiful. How come there\u2019s only nine children who succeeded up until now? Looks like the hurdle this time is too large.\u201dAs soon as they arrived, the faces of clan elders from all types of clans darkened. This test was simply too difficult. How could there be so few who made it out of over tens of thousands?One must know that the people who came here were already carefully selected by their clans, and were extremely outstanding. Why couldn\u2019t they accomplish anything here at the Heaven Mending Pavilion?Even though everyone was dissatisfied, they knew what was going on within their hearts. There were children from nobility, and there were even Archaic Descendants2\u00a0who wished to enter the Heaven Mending Pavilion. These geniuses occupied the majority of the slots available.Therefore, the Heaven Mending Pavilion greatly raised the difficulty of selecting disciples this time. This caused many of the promising children to return back, defeated and in low spirits.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way. Too many experts showed up this time,\u201d said Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s elder Xiong Fei. Although he was regretful, there really was no way to satisfy everyone.\u201cThere aren\u2019t many people at the second region either. There\u2019s only sixteen people.\u00a0Ai!\u201d Everyone sighed.The third region was even more ridiculous, as only eight people came. Furthermore, they were all extremely exhausted and sweaty all over.\u201cThis is too hard!\u201d Everyone was complaining as their faces darkened.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There is still three days of time left. The people who pass the trial now are all outstanding people. There has to be more people behind them,\u201d Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s elder Zhuo Yun said.\u201cIt\u2019s certain that there will be some, but there won\u2019t be too many. The longer that time passes by, the more weary and exhausted people will be, so where will they get the strength to break the formation?\u201d An elder from a huge clan retorted.\u201cThat might not necessarily be so. There are still some geniuses who are in the second battlefield right now. I believe there will be quite a bit of people.\u201d The few elders of Heaven Mending Pavilion consoled everyone.Be that as it may, the following few regions were similarly bleak, and everyone\u2019s hearts immediately sank as their faces became uglier.Although the elders of Heaven Mending Pavilion were apologetic, their hearts were incredibly excited because all the disciples this time were extremely talented, and would inevitably surpass the past ones.When they finally arrived at the eighth region, the situation changed. This made some of the elders of large clans hopeful, because there were actually almost a hundred people here.\u201cMy god! The geniuses were all concentrated in the eighth region. It\u2019s unprecedented that there are actually so many people here. The number here actually surpassed the seven previous regions combined.\u201d Heaven Mending Pavilion\u2019s elder Xiong Fei nodded his head with a full smile on his face.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The eighth region is pretty good.\u201d Zhuo Yun approved.All the clan elders of large clans began to ease up a bit since it was not as ugly as they thought.\u201cYi,\u00a0that\u2019s my clan\u2019s Da Meng. He was defeated four times in a row, so I did not believe that he would actually succeed this year, haha\u2026\u201d A clan elder carefreely laughed.\u201cHey, My clan\u2019s Qing Hu also succeeded. Look at his exuberant energy. It seems like he didn\u2019t waste that much strength. He\u2019s truly a heroic youngster and not so simple!\u201dAll of these clan elders revealed their happiness one after the other with great excitement, because there was a steady flow of one young person after another walking out. Sometimes, they discovered that even their own clan\u2019s children were within the group.At first, elder Xiong Fei hung a smile on his face and repeatedly nodded his head. So many geniuses had walked out from the eighth region, and he felt that they were actually quite formidable. However, he slowly began to feel as if something was off. Why were there still people coming out? So many people had walked out, and it seemed as if this line was never ending.\u201cOne, two\u2026two hundred fourteen\u2026\u201dAfter a simple count, he could not help but furrow his brows. Why did so many people come out all of a sudden? The barrier was supposedly incredibly difficult, yet it seemed as if it was completely ineffective.\u201cFour hundred, four hundred and one\u2026\u201dHe continued to count. Elder Xiong Fei was starting to fidget, and he muttered to himself, \u201cThere are so many geniuses\u2026 It truly is quite rare.\u201d\u201cEn, This was unexpected, and certainly surpassed the past. Anyway, this is a good thing.\u201d Elder Zhuo Yun satisfyingly nodded his head.When the number of people surpassed a thousand, elder Xiong Fei\u2019s buttocks seemed to have been lit on fire and completely stood up.Elder Zhuo Yun was a bit dumbstruck as well and said, \u201cThere are too much geniuses here. The eighth region is truly not so simple.\u201dThe other elders frowned and quietly discussed among themselves. Someone opened their mouth and said, \u201cThere are too many people. This is not okay. Shouldn\u2019t we retest these people again? Otherwise, the number of people entering would greatly surpass our estimation.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t be too good. Those elders of large tribes would have complaints and be discontent. After all, this year\u2019s barrier has been set exceptionally high,\u201d someone helplessly said.When the number of people reached two thousand, elder Xiong Fei\u2019s face turned green. Aren\u2019t there too many geniuses here? Elder Zhuo Yun was at a loss for words as well, and he did not know what to say.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The other few elders of Heaven Mending Pavilion felt dizzy and they were completely stunned.\u201cThis can\u2019t be right!\u201d When the number of people reached three thousand, the elders all became restless and almost pulled their own beards out. Their faces all turned green as they were unable to remain calm any longer.On the contrary, all of the clan elders from large tribes and huge clans were beaming with joy in excitement. They all felt that their clan\u2019s children were great, and quite of few of them actually passed the test.\u201cChild, you\u2019re really not that bad. You passed the trial when you are still so young.\u201d\u201cEr Hei, your twenty years of effort is not in vain. You finally succeeded.\u201dAfter hearing the voices of these clan elders, the few elders of the Heaven Mending Pavilion were extremely furious. They were anxious to death in the face of this scene that was completely opposite from their initial established circumstances.\u201cI\u2026 What did I want to say? Oh that\u2019s right! That kid\u2019s still nasally and dripping with snot, how did he pass?!\u201d Elder Xiong Fei was jumping in madness and became worried to the point that his head was spinning.\u201cThank you elder for your compliment.\u201d A six to seven year of nasally kid walked out and bowed towards elder Xiong Fei. He then wiped the snot from his nose and nearly rubbed it onto elder Xiong Fei\u2019s body.\u201cTo hell with it! There has to be something wrong here!\u201d At this moment, the elders of Heaven Mending Pavilion wished that could darken their eyes and pass out.Because the scene in front of their eyes was too terrifying. The number of people surpassed four thousand people, and what was even more unforgivable was that these children walked shoulder to shoulder in large groups as they walked out.Let alone the present, there weren\u2019t even this many geniuses in the ancient era when saints were struggling for power.How did this look anything like passing a trial. These children were all smiles as they formed groups and walked forward. This was so shocking that many chins dropped to the floor.The few elder\u2019s faces were green until the point that they could not become any more green. In the end, they could not help but shout, \u201cInvestigate! Get to the bottom of this!\u201dThese voices were incredibly miserable, and it disturbed the higher powers of Heaven Mending Pavilion. Many people became startled after hearing these voices, because they thought an Archaic Descendant was attacking or something.After four hours, there were finally no more children walking out. Everyone carefully counted, and discovered that a total of eight thousand nine-hundred and twenty seven people that cleared the trial.This number astonished the higher powers of Heaven Mending Pavilion so much that their faces turned green, since this was too scary. This was a unique experience that surpassed all previous records from the start of time.Ten thousand people entered, and only a thousand or so did not come out. Everyone else had succeeded.After an a hour, several elders were flustered and exasperated at the eighth region. Elder Xiong Fei and Zhuo Yun almost spat out a mouthful of blood.\u201cGod dammit! Who did this!?\u201dAfter hearing those wretched and angry shouts, the clan elders of large clans all looked at each other in dismay. None of them knew what kind of provocation those few people received.After a short while, the higher powers of Heaven Mending Pavilion received the news. All of their heads faced the sky, and were speechless for a long time.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The clan elders of large clans all carefully and prudently inquired.Finally, those higher powers all turned around and left. Looking at their backs, the people could not guess their mood or state of mind.\u201cThere\u2019s a little thief that stole the precious bones of the eighth region and sabotaged the trial grounds!\u201dIn the end, the news still leaked, and all the elders of large clans were dumbstruck and petrified; they began to look silly. In the end, all of their mouths twitched as they resisted the urge to take action and remained silent.\u201cAfter all is said and done, who did this?\u201d an elder roared.\u201cWho else could it be? It has to be that devilish brat. Who said he didn\u2019t come? This is now confirmed, and this was all done by him!\u201d Elder Xiong Fei\u2019s tears were streaming down his cheeks since that kid truly knew how to toy with people.\u201cDon\u2019t let me see him. If he enters Heaving Mending Pavilion, the first thing I\u2019ll do is spank his bottom eighty times!\u201d elder Zhuo Yun fiercely said.However, someone else immediately continued and said, \u201cLittle brother, where are you? The doors to Zhulu Academy is always open for you!\u201dThe one talking was precisely Zhulu Academy\u2019s female War God. Her entire elegant body that was beautiful in everyway emitted a golden shine. Her charmingly pure white face was like jade, and it was much different from before. An extremely gentle smile hung over her face.Elder Zhuo Yun immediately began to sweat as he looked into every direction.At the same time, the Void God Realm boiled with madness as soon as this information was received.\u201cIs it really that baby who apparently appeared?\u201d\u201cWho could it be apart from him? Unfortunately for the Heaven Mending Pavilion, this is the same behavior he showed at the Starting Ground.\u201d\u201cHaha, this odd child is truly lacking in morals!\u201d\u201cHeaven Mending Pavilion is too pitiful. This naughty kid truly makes people speechless. As expected, he once again did some huge thing that would anger the heavens!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, whoever comes into contact with him would certainly suffer from his heaven angering actions. Even the Void God Realm could not bear him any longer. It\u2019s unknown whether or not the Heaven Mending Pavilion will banish him,\u00a0hahaha\u2026\u201dAt this very moment, the entire Void God Realm was in clamors as everyone laughed and discussed this situation.\u201cThis child truly knows how to torment people. He\u2019s a bit too disastrous right? Wherever he goes, there\u2019s no peace. Fortunately, he\u2019s pretty far from us now.\u201d Hammer uncle wiped off some of his cold sweat.Coin elder did not say anything. His moves were very nimble and skilled. He erected a table at a place where many people gathered with the following words on the surface: If you wish to know the milk baby\u2019s secret, please donate one spirit coin.Bird grandpa\u2019s movements were not slow either. He immediately tore off a rag and laid it at the side with these words on top: One spirit coin, one exclusive secret.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
